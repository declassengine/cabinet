The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.It had been a period of full moon and Bomber Command hadbeen confined to attacks on railway targets in enemy-occupiedterritory, on which 5,300 tons of bombs had been dropped.Thirty-one aircraft had been lost out of 1,781 sorties. Americanbombers had attacked aircraft factories and airfields, dropping3,700 tons of bombs. Sixty-eight aircraft had been lost out of 1,980sorties.The Allied Expeditionary Air Forces and the Tactical AirForce had made 6,300 sorties and lost 60 fighters. Eailway centresand airfields had been attacked and 200 enemy aircraft had beenclaimed destroyed on the ground and a similar number damaged.139 enemy aircraft had been destroyed in the air by fighters and110 by bombers.13,000 sorties had been flown by the Allied Air Forces. Italianrailways had been the main target. There had been severalsuccessful attacks on shipping in the Adriatic and in the ^Egean.445 enemy aircraft were claimed as destroyed and 135 probablydestroyed, but there was almost certainly some duplication in theseclaims.  In all the Mediterranean operations we lost 100 aircraft.2,500 tons of supplies had been carried by air and 3,000 troopsflown in. The enemy had lost 55 aircraft destroyed and 9 probablydestroyed, for our own losses of 18.Heavy attacks had been carried out on Hollandia and Rabaul.Eighty-two enemy aircraft had been destroyed for 12 Allied.Shipping losses by enemy action reported in April to dateamounted to about 8,800 tons. Three U-boats have been sunk sofar in April and 2 probably sunk. A large convoy had arrived inNorth Russia without any loss or damage. Photographs of theTirpitz revealed 16 certain and 8 probable hits out of 98 bombsdropped.The Prime Minister directed the First Lord of the Admiraltyto convey the congratulations of the War Cabinet to all concernedon the extremely successful and gallant attack carried out on theTirpitz. He had no doubt that the Admiralty had under considera-tion the question of recommendations for appropriate awards.A homeward-bound convoy in mid-Atlantic had been attackedby a U-boat. Two ships were hit and one sunk, and the U-boat hadprobably been destroyed.At Anzio discharges had averaged 5,000 tons per daythroughout the week. Four enemy coastal steamers had beencaptured in the Adriatic and several caiques in the iEgean. Themutiny of Greek forces had spread to some naval ships inAlexandria, which had been isolated. Other Greek ships in theMediterranean did not appear to be affected, and two destroyerswhich had been ordered to sail from Alexandria on the 7th Aprilhad done so.In an attack on the Carolines the Americans claimed to havedamaged 21 warships, as well as over 20 merchant ships, withoutloss to themselves.The 1st German Panzer Army, at one time surrounded nearSkala, appeared to have worked its way westwards; the 2nd GermanArmoured Division had made a thrust towards this force andclaimed to have made contact with it. The Russians had reachedthe former Czechoslovakian frontier, and the Roumanian town ofJassy had been practically cut off. In the Crimea, a strong Russianoffensive across the Perekop Isthmus and the Gulf of Sivash hadmade good progress.Progress on the Arakan front had continued. In the Imphalsector strong enemy pressure continued. Further north there hadbeen heavy fighting round Kohima. Our forces were launchingattacks against the lines of communications of the Japanese forcesof the 31st Japanese Division. In general, the situation wascomplex and confused, but the Japanese had suffered heaviercasualties than our own, and the advent of the monsoon would affecttheir lines of communications more seriously than ours.
The Prime Minister emphasised the importance of air trans-port for this campaign. We should not hesitate to press the UnitedStates authorities to make still further air transport available, atthe expense of transport to China, if the urgent needs of the battlejustified this.Greek Troops. The dissatisfaction amongst Greek garrison troops had spreadto the Greek Brigade and the situation had deteriorated. TheBrigade had been cut off from all food supplies but had accessto water. Adequate British forces were available to control thesituation.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Foreign Affairs.Mr. CordellHiill&apos;8 Speech.France.General deGaulle andGeneral Giraud.(PreviousReference:W.M.

The Prime Minister referred to the chief points in thespeech made by Mr. Cordell Hull on the 9th April. He thought thatthis speech had been very helpful in several ways. Thus, in regardto the Atlantic Charter, Mr. Hull had said, since one of our objec-tives was the prevention of aggression and the establishment ofworld security, the Charter certainly did not prevent any step,including those relating to enemy States, necessary to achieve thisobject. The fact that clarification on this, and other points, hadcome from a spokesman of the United States Government had easedthe pressure upon us for a clarifying statement.Again, Mr. Hull&apos;s public declaration about the position of theFrench Committee of National Liberation had, he thought, to alarge extent superseded the draft directive which the President haddrawn up some weeks ago, and sent to him (the Prime Minister) forhis concurrence, about the position of the Committee in regard tocivil affairs when the liberation of French territory had started.The War Cabinet had a short discussion of the developments inconnection with the abolition of the post of Commander-in-Chiefnow held by General Giraud. The Prime Minister doubted whetherGeneral Giraud would accept the less important post of Inspector-General which General de Gaulle had offered him. Our policy,however, should be to do all in our power to maintain friendlyrelations between the two Generals and try to persuade GeneralGiraud to accept the post offered to him.The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet of the latestdevelopments in regard to Roumania, Finland and the Russo-Polishsituation. A record of the discussion on these matters is containedin the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.
Greece.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 1stConclusions,Minute 3.)The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet of the recentevents in the Greek situation. These had developed very rapidlyover the week-end and decisions had had to be taken at short notice.The King of Greece was now on his way hack to Cairo;M. Tsouderos had been persuaded to remain .in office pending theKing&apos;s arrival and had undertaken to give him all possible adviceand support and co-operation thereafter. Steps had been taken todeal with the disorderly or mutinous developments in Greek navaland military units. The Prime Minister did not regard these latterdisorders seriously, and hoped that a better state of affairs wouldsoon prevail.The War Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement and approvedthe action which he had taken in this matter.Japan.Eelief Suppliesfor Prisoners ofWar andInternees.(PreviousEef erence:W.M.(44)llthConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (44) 183) embodying a scheme forthe shipping of supplies for prisoners of w&amp;r and internees in thehands of the Japanese. This had been prepared by the War Officewith the agreement of the various Departments concerned. Itsessential points were -. (a) A request that a ship carrying supplies with a neutral crew,operated by the International Red Cross Committee,should be allowed to proceed to a port designated by theJapanese on the perimeter of the area under Japanesecontrol.(b) An offer to provide a separate ship to be handed over to theJapanese and to be used by them for the collection ofthe supplies from the designated port and their furtherdistribution to the various places where prisoners ofwar and internees are held in the Far East.The need for these supplies for the relief of those detained inthe Far East was desperate and all previous efforts to get them tothe prisoners had failed with the exception of comparatively smallamounts occasionally carried by exchange ships. But the schemenow proposed might, as the Secretary of State for War pointed outin his Memorandum, be criticised as implying too facile an accept-ance of the Japanese refusal to comply with the customs of civilisednations and as humiliating to the Governments of this country andthe Dominions. He felt, therefore, that it must be for the WarCabinet to say whether they wished it presented to the JapaneseGovernment.The Secretary of State for War said that, to the considerationsset out in his Memorandum, he need only add that acceptance of thepresent proposal might constitute a dangerous precedent. to theextent that it might encourage belligerents, who did not abide bythe normal customs of civilised nations, to raise their terms. Thepossibility of asking the Russian Government to arrange for thetransport of these stores in a Russian vessel had been fully con-sidered. But the Japanese continued to raise difficulties over this.No Russian vessel had, it appeared, entered Japanese waters sinceJapan entered the war, and the conclusion of those best able to judgewas that the Japanese were reluctant to allow any neutral vessel .tosail in Japanese waters.The Minister of State felt that, despite the arguments of theother side, if a ship could be made available by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, the proposals agreed by the Departments should beapproved. The Foreign-Office would be placed in an impossibleposition vis-a-vis the relatives of individuals who might die incaptivity if we failed to make this attempt.Mr. Bruce said that his Government had virtually agreed tothe principle of the present proposal nearly a year ago. He had noreason to think that they would have changed their view since then/
Man-power.Civil Defenceand HomeGuardMan-Power.(PreviousReference:W.M (43) 164thConclusions,Minute 6.)After further discussion, the War Cabinet Approved the departmental proposal as set out in theMemorandum circulated under W.P. (44) 183, subject tothe appropriate steps being taken to obtain the concurrence-  of the Dominion Governments.4. At their meeting on the 1st December, 1943 (W.M. (43)164th Conclusions, Minute 6), the War Cabinet had set up aCommittee under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of theExchequer to state the extent to which Civil Defence work wasalready undertaken by the Home Guard, and to consider whetherit would be practicable to secure some further merging of the CivilDefence General Services and the Home Guard. The War Cabinetnow had before them a Memorandum by the-; Chancellor of theExchequer (W.P. (44) 184), to which was annexed a statement ofthe conclusions and recommendations which had emerged from areview of the existing arrangements for mutual assistance betweenthe Civil Defence General Service and the Home Guard carried outby the Departments concerned at the Committee&apos;s request.The Memorandum endorsed the conclusions in paragraphs (1)to (4) of the Annex that at the present stage of the war no degreeof merging in the strict sense of unification of control between thetwo Services was practicable; that until a revised operationalappreciation enabled a reduction to be made in commitments nodiminution in efficiency in the Services was acceptable; and that,since the number of persons not yet undertaking any form ofnational part-time service but available for direction by theMinistry of Labour was small, the main sources from which cutsin the whole-time strength of the Civil Defence General Servicescould be made good were the Fire Guard and the Home Guard,while the Fire Guard must remain the main source of recruits forthe Home Guard. The Memorandum also accepted the conclusion,recorded in paragraph (6) of the Annex, that the question ofcompulsory direction of Civil Defence personnel into the HomeGuard should not be reopened.The Memorandum recommended that the Departments shouldbe authorised to put in force certain measures, set forth in para-graph (5) of the Annex, designed to enable the Civil DefenceGeneral Services, the National Fire Service and the Home Guard,by means of increased mutual assistance and by certain limitedre-allocation of personnel, to meet their existing commitments; andit suggested that the War Cabinet should issue a direction urgingon all Departments the need for completing as soon as possible thereorganisation of the fire guard at business premises which was nowbeing undertaken and which would result in a smaller number ofpersons being required for that duty at premises where hithertothere had been a surplus.Lastly, after pointing out that, until a revised operationalappreciation enabled a reduction to be made in the existing commit-ments of the Civil Defence General Services, the National FireService and the Home Guard, there was no possibility that thesethree Services as a whole would be able to release personnel for othersectors of the war effort, the Memorandum recommended that theWar Cabinet should ask the Chiefs of Staff to submit a revisedappreciation as soon as operations on the Continent had progressedfar enough to make this possible.The War Cabinet (1) Accepted the conclusions and recommendations set forth inthe Annex to W.P: (44) 184.(2) Directed all Departments concerned to expedite thereorganisation of the fire guard at business premisesprescribed by the new Fire Guard orders.Invited the Chiefs of Staff to submit a revised operationalappreciation as soon as operations on the Continent hadprogressed far enough to make this possible.(3)Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,11th April, 1944.
