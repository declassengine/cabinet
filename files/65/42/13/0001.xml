India.Food GrainRequirements.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 36thConclusions,Minute 4.)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (W.P. (44) 216) reviewing the latestposition as regards the Indian food grain situation. The resultwas a net worsening of 550,000 tons and the Viceroy, in addition tothe 200,000 tons already promised, now required 724,000 tons ofwheat if the minimum needs of the civil population were to be metand, the Army were also to receive their requirements.The Secretary of State for India said that the position had beenworsened by unseasonable weather, and by the disaster at Bombay,in which 45,000 tons of badly-needed foodstuffs and 11 ships hadbeen lost. He was satisfied that everything possible had been doneby the Authorities in India to meet the situation. Given the threatto operations which any breakdown in India&apos;s economic lifeinvolved,, he felt that we should now apprise the United States ofthe seriousness of the position. It must be for the War Cabinet todecide how far we should ask for their actual assistance.Sir Firoz Khan Noon said that everything possible was beingdone in India to control prices and movements of grain. The out-standing factor was a definite shortage of food grains in the country.The effect of the unseasonable rains this Spring had been very serious.The reactions on labour, on the health of the troops and on the opera-tional situation of food, shortages were very grave. Substantialimports from abroad were essential, not only to meet the shortages,but because of their reaction on public opinion and morale, and theirdeterrent effect on hoarders. While hoarding by merchants wasunder control, the peasant was still uneasy and was holding backsupplies. India, which had never been a self-supporting country,had lost her Burma imports and, in addition, was carrying a heavyincrease of population and substantial numbers of troops. Maliciousrumours were being spread by interested parties in India that theUnited States were willing to help with the grain but that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would not apply to them. If we nowapproached the United, States and they were unable to help, it wouldat least dispel that allegation.His Highness the Maharaja of Kashmir expressed his generalagreement with the case as stated by the Secretary of State for Indiaand Sir Firoz Khan Noon.The Minister of War Transport pointed out that the existingprogramme of imports provided 35,000 tons of food grains permonth for India from December last to the end of September next.He was satisfied that no further shipping could be made available,save directly at the expense of operations or of the United Kingdomimport programme. The United States were themselves faced withvery serious shipping difficulties.The Prime Minister said that it was clear that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could only provide further relief for the Indiansituation at the cost of incurring grave difficulties in otherdirections. At the same time, there was a strong obligation on usto replace the grain which had, perished in the Bombay explosion.He was sceptical as to any help being forthcoming from America,save at the cost of operations or the United Kingdom importprogramme. At the same time his sympathy was great for thesufferings of the people of India.The Chancellor of the Exchequer felt that we were under anobligation to make good the loss due to the explosion and that weshould raise that issue with the United States Government, addingthat we were receiving very gloomy reports about the harvest inupper India, but did not want to press them on the general issueuntil we had firmer figures. Meanwhile the Government of Indiashould be informed of the steps we had taken to try and replace thegrain lost at Bombay, and should be invited to report again as soonas the harvest began to come in and they were in a position to letHis Majesty&apos;s Government have firmer figures on which to work.
Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,24th April, 1944.After further consideration the War Cabinet agreed asfollows : (1) The Prime Minister would represent to the President thesituation which had arisen from the Bombay explosion,with such additional detail in regard to the generallythreatenng character of the Indian food situation andits possible effect on operations, as was thought desirableat this stage. He would urge them to assist us withshipping, on the understanding, however, that any helpgiven would be additional to, and would not come outof, the shipping already allocated to us, and would notbe made in such a way as to reduce the United Kingdomimport programme.(2) The replacement of the 45,000 tons of grain lost in theBombay explosion should be regarded as an obligationwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government must meet even ifthe American response was negative. The Minister ofWar Transport should consider what shipping disposi-tions would be necessary to ensure this in that event.(3) The draft of a communication from the Prime Minister tothe President should be prepared by a Committee,consisting of the Home Secretary and Minister of HomeSecurity (in the Chair), the Minister of Production,the Secretary of State for India, the Secretary of Statefor War, the Minister of War Transport, the Paymaster-General, and Sir Firoz Khan Noon. The Committeeshould report within a week&apos;s time.
