Civil 1.   The War Cabinet had before them the following papersAviation. dealing with the future Departmental responsibility for civilFuture aviation : Departmental (i) a Report by the Chairman of the Committee on theEesponsibility. Machinery of Government (W.P. (44) 134),(Previous (j^ two Memoranda by the Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (44) 264Reference: and 322),W.M.(44)46th (iii) two Memoranda by the Secretary of State  for  AirConclusions.) (W p (44) 276 and W.P. (44) 336),(iv) a Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs and the Secretary of State for theColonies (W.P. (44) 303), and(v) a Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport (W.P.(44) 331).The discussion concentrated mainly on the proposal made bythe Lord Privy Seal in W.P. (44) 322 for the immediate transferto the Ministry of War Transport of the Civil Aviation Departmentof the Air Ministry. The following arguments were adduced infavour of this course: (a) Unless substantial progress was made at once with thedesign and development of new types of civil transportaircraft, and with the negotiation of agreements withforeign countries, it would be impossible for this countryto secure a fair share in the post-war development ofcivil aviation.(b) It was impossible for the Secretary of State for Air todevote the necessary time, to questions of civil aviation,and the present arrangements under which responsi-bility was in effect shared with the Chairman of theCommittee on Post-War Civil Air Transport wereregarded by some Ministers as unsatisfactory.&apos; (c) Experience showed that the Civil Aviation Department ofthe Air Ministry did not in fact give the necessarysupport to British civil aviation, which should becontrolled by a Department with a civilian and commer-cial outlook. This was all the more important seeingthat the future of our aircraft manufacturing industrywas largely dependent on the development of- British&apos; civil aviation.&apos; (d) Aircraft were in fact available which could be adapted forcivil use, and would be so adapted if responsibility forcivil aviation was vested in a civil instead of a militarydepartment.(e) The Committee on Post-War Civil Air Transport, with theexception of the Secretary of State for Air, were infavour of the transfer, and there would be strongsupport for it in both Houses of Parliament. We werenot giving the Dominions a lead such as they wereentitled to expect.The following were the main arguments used against immediatetransfer : -(/) We could not afford to take any action which would impairthe efficiency of our war effort. But this would inevitablyfollow if responsibility for civil aviation were nowremoved from the Air Ministry owing to the close con-nexion between B.O.A.C. and the Transport Command,which, again, was closely interwoven With the otherR.A.F. commands.(g) Immediate transfer from the Air Ministry would, indeed,be bad, not only for the war effort, but also for civilaviation; since while the war lasted, civil aviation couldbest be helped through its close association with Trans-port Command.
129W.M. 81 (M).(h) Thus, the continuance of the close link between Civil Avia-tion Department and Transport Command would makeit easier to devise plans for the expansion of Britishcivil air transport into liberated areas in Europe as themilitary situation allowed.(;) It was not the case that the Air Ministry had neglectedcivil aviation, and a great deal of development wastaking place.(k) Several statements had been made in Parliament thatresponsibility for civil aviation would not be transferredfrom the Air Ministry during the war and these state-ments had been accepted.Discussion then turned on the position, vis-a-vis the UnitedStates if civil aviation were transferred to a Civil Department (I) In favour of the maintenance of the present position it wasargued that the fact that the Civil Aviation Departmentformed part of a Service Department had enabled us,through the good relations between the British and theUnited States Service personnel, to get far more helptowards the development of civil aviation from theUnited States than would have been possible, had respon-sibiiity been vested in a Civil Department: 81(m) It was also urged that transfer of responsibility for civilaviation at this moment might be taken in the UnitedStates as meaning that we meant to take steps to buildup an important civil aviation business for ourselvesafter the war; and that if this was done before thePresidential election, it might make matters moredifficult for us.(n) On the other hand, it was urged that we should get moreaircraft for civil aviation if our approaches to the. Combined Munitions Assignment Board were madethrough civilian representatives. (This led to somediscussion as to the upshot of previous negotiations forthe supply of aircraft for civil purposes.)(o) It was also argued that in the discussions on civil aviationwhich the Lord Privy Seal had had-with Mr. Berleearlier in the year, the United States representatives^had accepted the view that this country would wish tosecure a fair share of civil aviation after the war, andthat United States opinion would not attach any specialimportance to transfer of responsibility between twoexisting Departments. It was not as though thecreation of an entirely new Department was con-templated.Alternatives to transfer to Ministry of War Transport.The general view expressed in the papers circulated to theWar Cabinet and in the discussion favoured transfer of responsi-bility for Civil Aviation, either now, or at some future date, tothe Ministry of War Transport. The Minister, had, however,made it clear that he did not see his way to accept responsibilityuntil six months after the end of the war with Germany. It waspointed out that, if the Minister of War Transport were chargedwith the responsibility for civil aviation he might be embarrassedin his negotiations with the United States with regard to post-war&quot; shipping. This led to discussion of alternatives to thetransfer of responsibility to the Ministry of Transport.One suggestion was that a stronger Civil Aviation Depart-ment might be set up within the Air Ministry. The Departmentmight, for example, be under a Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState, charged with special responsibilty for securing rapiddevelopment and given as much independence as possible. Furtherthe Civil Aviation Department, so strengthened, might beorganised in such a way as to facilitate transfer to another Depart-ment at a later date.
Another suggestion made was that responsibility for civilaviation might be transferred from the Air Ministry to theMinistry of Aircraft Production which was, of course, chargedwith responsibility for design and production of new types.This would be a temporary measure, without prejudice to theultimate transfer of responsibility to the Ministry of War Trans-port after the war.In the course of discussion it was pointed out that the end ofthe war would inevitably bring a very large contraction in thenumbers of persons employed in the aircraft industry. Estimates ofthe extent to which air transport would be used after the warvaried greatly.It was, of course, important that British civil aviation shouldbe developed to the utmost possible extent; but it could not beexpected that aviation would provide employment for more than asmall fraction of the number of persons at present employed.[The probable small size of the Civil Aviation Industry was adducedin favour of keeping civil aviation with the Air Ministry evenafter the war.]There was general agreement that the points raised in thepapers before the War Cabinet required further consideration andthat the discussion should be resumed in about a week&apos;s time.The suggestion was made that in the interval a joint meeting mightbe held of representatives of the Machinery of Government Com-mittee and the Committee on Post-War Civil Air Transport inorder to focus the issues which required decision.Civil AirTransport.Requirementsfor&apos; Progressin Design.(PreviousReference:W.M.(43)35thConclusions,Minute 3.)X&quot;2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord Privy Seal (W.P. (44) 272) to which was attached a memo-randum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.On the 25th February, 1943, the War Cabinet had decided thatthe design of new types of civil aircraft and the conversion ofmilitary types to civil use should proceed as and when it could bedone without impairing the war effort. The Committee on Post-War Civil Air Transport, having considered the memorandum bythe Minister of Aircraft Production appended to W.P. (44) 272,invited the War Cabinet to reconsider this&apos; decision and to recorda conclusion on the following lines : (i) that civil types of aircraft should be given equalpriority, for the allocation of design staff, with &quot; non-designated &quot; military aircraft; that is, with militarytypes which have not been selected for the highest,priority;(ii) that provision should be made for the permanent defer-ment of young trainee draughtsmen working on militaryand civil aircraft design;(iii) that authority should be given for the recruitment ofsufficient draughtsmen to provide, by the fourth quarterof 1945, a peak of 460 draughtsmen over, and abovethose now engaged.The Secretary of State for Air said that when this matterbad been considered by the Committee on Post-War Civil AirTransport, he had thought it necessary to reserve his position untilthe effect on operational types had been considered. This had beenexamined, and he now supported the above recommendation.The War CabinetEndorsed the recommendation set out atX.1Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,20th June, 1944.
