Naval, Militaryand AirOperations.(PreviousEef erence:W.M. (44) 75thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Mediterranean.NavalOperations.MilitaryOperations.Normandy.Italy.Russia.2. . The Chiefs of Staff reported the events of the previous week.46,000 sorties had been flown in connection with the&apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos; operation.Bomber Command had dropped 14,800 tons of bombs, 3,000 ofthem on Germany. The attack on Gelsenkirchen had been mostsuccessful, and it was considered that the synthetic oil plant therewas now completely out of action. Successful attacks had also beenmade on Le Havre and Boulogne, causing great destruction toE-boats and other craft.&apos; United States bombers had flown 7,000 sorties and dropped3,000 tons of bombs on Germany. They, had also supported the&quot; Overlord &quot; operation.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 32,000 sorties,dropping 7,500 tons of bombs.Weather had interfered with attacks on &apos;&apos; Crossbow &apos;&apos; targets.Coastal Command aircraft had made 13 attacks on U-boats;2 had been sunk, 2 possibly sunk and 4 damaged. Four attacksremained to be assessed.Enemy losses for the week had been 235 aircraft as against350 Allied losses. -In the Mediterranean theatre 14,000 sorties had been flown asagainst 1,100 by the enemy; all of the latter had been in the backareas.  Enemy losses amounted to 197 as against 148 Allied aircraft.- During the previous week confirmed shipping losses due toenemy action, including the &apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos; losses, amounted to5,851 tons.   Total losses for June to date amounted, to 21,627 tons.During June 9 U-boats had been destroyed and 4 probablydestroyed.Bad weather and enemy shelling had somewhat impededunloading operations on the British beaches in North-West France.Unloading on the American beaches had proceeded satisfactorily.On the night of the 13th/14th June H.M.S. Ashanti and aPolish destroyer had engaged 7 enemy minesweepers off the ChannelIslands, sinking 3, probably sinking 1 and damaging 3 others.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff described the opera-tions in Normandy. The heaviest weight of attack by PanzerDivisions had been made against the British sector. The enemy hadsuffered fairly heavily and, apart from some slight withdrawals byour Forces, the line had changed little. The United States Forceshad made a considerable advance towards St. Lo and in the last24 hours they had driven right across the Cherbourg Peninsula.About 15,000 prisoners had been taken so far by the Allies.Our advance continued satisfactorily and the total number ofprisoners taken since the 11th May now amounted to 37,400. Therehad been stiff fighting in the initial stages of the landing on Elba.There had been a 30-mile advance in the Karelian Isthmus andthe Mannerheim line had now been penetrated.[27693-1]b 2Field-Marshal 1.   The Prime Minister said that he felt sure that all hisSmuts. colleagues would regret that Field-Marshal Smuts had decided thatit was necessary for him to return to South Africa during thepresent week. The Prime Minister paid tribute to the great servicewhich the Field-Marshal had rendered by his presence, and hopedthat it would not be long before he could return.Field-Marshal Smuts thanked the Prime Minister warmly forwhat he had said. He had already stayed in this country longerthan he had intended, and must now resume his responsibilities inSouth Africa. This had been his third visit during the war, and ithad made a very deep impression on him. In his opinion, events forthe Allies were now moving very well, and he would not besurprised if, before the end of the year, it became necessary for thePrime Minister to ask the Dominion Prime Ministers to hold afurther conference in this country.
Our forces had made a further advance south of Kohima. Theenemy was still holding out in Myitkyina, but progress had beenmade towards Magaung.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.3. Reference was made to the announcement which had beenmade of American casualties suffered in Normandy. The Americanshad had heavy losses on the opening day on one of the beaches; oneof their airborne divisions had also suffered severely. As a result,their losses to date had been about twice as heavy as our own. Itwas generally felt, however, that it was unfortunate that anindependent announcement should have been made of Americancasualties.The Prime Minister said that this had been done withoutGeneral Eisenhower&apos;s knowledge and that he thought the rightcourse would be that in future no announcement as to casualtiessustained in Normandy should be made except in statementsapproved by General Eisenhower.This suggestion met with approval.The Minister of Information said that Mr. Stimson had givenrecent figures of the United States casualties sustained in Italy, butthat no recent figures had been given of British casualties in thistheatre. This tended to give the impression that the Americanswere doing all the fighting.The Prime Minister said that, if the particulars were sent tohim, he would take the matter up.CasualtyAnnouncements.Air Raids.Attacks byFlying Bombs.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)79thConclusions,Minute 1.)Casualties.Tube FloodGates.Evacuation.4. The Prime Minister said that a series of conferences wasbeing held to determine the best means of countering this new formof attack, which, it was agreed, should in future be described in allofficial documents as &quot; flying bombs &quot; and not &apos;,&apos; pilotless aircraft.&quot;The Prime Minister thought that with patience, and aftervarious devices had been tried, we should find the means of over-coming this new form of attack. Various adjustments would benecessary, as, for example, in the warning system. All these matterswere receiving constant attention.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthe total casualties so far reported amounted to 526 killed, 2,200seriously injured, 2,240 slightly injured and 890 unclassified.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatat present when the Alert sounded the flood gates on the tube underthe Thames were closed and traffic was stopped, causing great&quot;inconvenience. The Air Ministry had advised that the risk offlooding as a result of damage from flying bombs was very slight.The Civil Defence Committee had decided to discontinue the closingof the gates.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security reportedthat the Civil Defence Committee had also considered whether anyevacuation of the priority classes should take place from London.The London schools were congested and, if a school were hit whilethe children were, there, there would no doubt be much criticism.On the other hand-, there was at present no public demand forevacuation, and the general view of the Committee had been that,pending further developments, evacuation plans should not be putinto force.The War Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of these decisions of the CivilDefence Committee.
Damage to The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said that.Buildings.        according to reports, 137,000 buildings had been damaged in varyingdegrees.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that the roofing ofover 100 aircraft factories had been damaged. He hoped that labourwould be speedily available to carry out repairs.The War Cabinet-Agreed that this matter should be dealt with by theMinister of Production, the Minister of Labour andNational Service and the Minister of Works in concertwith other Ministers concerned, without reference to theWar Cabinet.Parliament.Meeting Place.(PreviousBef erence:W.M.(43)lstConclusions,Minute 7.)5. After a short discussion, the War Cabinet decided that, asfrom the following day, Parliament should meet in Church House.The chambers for both Houses would be ready on the following day,but some of the other accommodation could not be made ready untillater in the week. It would not be possible to send notification toindividual members, who would be told on arrival at the Houses ofParliament of the change in place of meeting.The Minister of Works was invited to take the necessary action.&quot; Overlord &quot; 6.   The War Cabinet were reminded that it had been decidedSecurity. that the diplomatic ban should be lifted that day.   The questionCensorship of was raised whether this action would result in the enemy obtainingDiplomatic valuable information, not otherwise obtainable, about the effect ofCommunications flying bombs.from this The War Cabinet decided that the balance of advantage lay inCountry. adhering to the decision to lift the ban forthwith, more especially(Pievious as it was unlikely that the enemy would obtain much informationBeferenee: of value in this manner.W.M. (44) 77th The War Cabinet also decided that there would be advantageConclusions, in making a public statement that the ban had been lifted.Minute l.) Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was asked tomake the necessary arrangements.&quot; Overlord &quot;Security.Bestrictions ofPersons leavingthe Country.Editor of theChicagoTribune.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)69thConclusions;Minute 4.)7. Reference was made to the case of the Editor of the ChicagoTribune, who had arrived in this country about the 23rd May, andwho had not been allowed to return to the United States at the endof that month. Mr. Maloney was still in this country, and thequestion was raised whether he could be allowed to leave thiscountry as soon as the ban on diplomatic communications had beenraised.The War Cabinet-Decided that Mr. Maloney&apos;s case should be determined byreference not to the diplomatic ban, but to the restrictionsimposed on travel. Mr. Maloney should be allowed to leavewhen these restrictions were relaxed, i.e., probably aboutthe end of June.Prisonersof War.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)73rdConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that we hadnow obtained all the information which we were likely to get aboutthe R.A.F. Officers who had been killed after escaping from aGerman prisoners-of-war camp. It seemed clear that they had beenmurdered by the Gestapo. It was possible that one motive for thisterrible action had been German alarm of the numbers of escapeswhich had taken place, and their effect on foreign labour.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he thought that,subject to the approval of the Dominion Governments, a public
statement on the matter should be made on Friday. It was suggestedthat this might take the line that we could not accept the GermanGovernments explanation; that we regarded these officers as havingbeen murdered; and that we proposed to do all in our power toascertain those who had been responsible for this deed and to bringto justice those who were proved guilty of it when the war came toan end.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, theSecretary of State for Air and the Secretary of State forWar should prepare and submit to the Prime Minister astatement for publication on the above general lines.War Pensions. 9.   The War Cabinet had before them-A Joint Memorandum by the Lord President of theCouncil, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (44) 306) dealingwith the representations made by the Service Membersof the House of Commons Committee with regard to thepension rates for the widows and children of other ranksannounced in the White Paper, and with the proposalsmade in the House of Lords for improvements in thepension rates of widows and children of officers;A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs and Leader of the House of Lords (W.P. (44)314) proposing an increase in the education allowancesfor children of officers killed in action; andA Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions (W.P. (44)335) suggesting that any increase in educationallowances should be given to the children of other ranksas well as to the children of officers.The Lord President of the Council and the Chancellor of theExchequer explained that the main criticism raised was that,whereas the new minimum rates for; the wives and children ofserving men were 35s. and 12s. Qd. a week respectively, thecorresponding pension rates for widows and children were 32s. 6d.and 11s. a week. The new pension rates represented a substantialimprovement on the previous rates, and the argument that thepension rates should be equalised with the rates and allowances forthe wives and children of serving men was fallacious, since awidow&apos;s obligations and commitments were not the same as thoseof a wife of a serving man. Moreover, any change in the pensionrates would have wide repercussions. Accordingly, he and hiscolleagues had come to the conclusion that the rates announced inthe White Paper should be maintained. If the Service MembersCommittee wished to raise the matter in the House, they should beinformed that the question of a debate should be pursued throughthe usual channels.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the rates of pensions for widows and childrenof other ranks announced in the White Paper should bemaintained.With regard to the question of allowances for the widows andchildren of officers, the Lord President of the Council said that hiscolleagues and he were satisfied that a general increase would notbe justified.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he feltthat there should be some recognition of the special responsibilitiesundertaken and the special risks run by officers, particularly thosewho had risen from the ranks by their own merits.   There was a^-ri eviousEef erence:W.M.(44)68thConclusions,Minute 6.)(i)(ii)(iii)
tendency for men to refuse to take commissions on the ground thatthe advantages did not compensate them for the additional burdensand risks involved. He would not propose any increase in thepensions given to widows, but he urged strongly that the educationallowances for children of officers should not be limited to  50. Heobserved that during the last war the maximum had been  80, andhe felt that, in view of the present cost of education, the adoptionof a lower maximum for the present war could not be justified.In discussion, there was strong support for the view thatadequate recognition should be given to the special burdens andresponsibilities carried by officers, who in the modern army weredrawn from all classes of the community. It was suggested,however, that there were disadvantages in a formal differentiationin the rates of education allowance, and that there was much to besaid for raising the limit from  50 to  80 for the children of otherranks as well as for officers&apos; children. No precise estimate of thecost of doing this could be made, but, since in administering theallowances the Ministry of Pensions took into account the meansof the surviving parent, the type of education which the child&apos;sfather would have provided for the child and the extent to whichthe child could benefit from higher education, the sum involved wasnot likely to be very great.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord President of the Council, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs to arrange to receive a deputation from the Houseof Lords on the subject of the rates of pension forwidows and children of officers.(2) Agreed that the Ministers concerned should consider thepossibility of raising the maximum limit for educationallowances for the children of both officers and otherranks from  50 to  80, and should report to the WarCabinet on the matter, after receiving the deputation.of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,19^ June, 1944.
