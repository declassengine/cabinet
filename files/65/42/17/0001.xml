Indian Food 1.   The   War   Cabinet  had  before  them  a  MemorandumGrains. (W.P. (44) 228) by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home(Previous Security containing the report of the .Committee appointed by theReference: War Cabinet at its meeting on the 24th April (W.M. (44) 55th Con-W.M. (44) 55th elusions) to prepare the draft of a communication from the PrimeConclusions.) Minister to President Roosevelt about the Indian food situation.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security informedthe War Cabinet that since the Committee was appointed a furtherreduction had been reported in the amount of grain lost in theBombay explosion. The Committee in these circumstances hadthought it unwise to base any approach to the President primarilyon the losses due to the explosion, and recommended in the draftnow circulated, for which they were indebted to the Minister forWar Transport, an approach on broader lines. The latest figuresreceived from India showed a very slight further reduction in lossesat Bombay, but were not necessarily final.The Minister of Reconstruction said that he had had theopportunity of a discussion with Mr. Kirby, rationing adviser tothe Government of India, who had confirmed all that the Secretaryof State for India had previously said about the gravity of theposition, and had suggested that it might be of assistance if a groupof experts in rationing could be sent from this country to help inthe administration Of rationing in India.The Secretary of State for India said that he would welcomeany such arrangement, and the Minister of Food undertook to lookinto the matter.The Deputy Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the textof a telegram, SAC 1911 of the 27th April, from the SupremeCommander, South-East Asia Command, on the food situation, andinformed them that the Prime Minister had suggested that certainportions of it should be incorporated in the telegram now proposedto be sent to President Roosevelt.The War Cabinet-Approved  the  draft  telegram to President  Rooseveltsubject to (a) the amendment of line 5 of paragraph 1 to read :&quot; damage on the Indian spring crops. Indiansshortage . . . .&quot;(b) the insertion of such of the arguments from theSupreme Commander&apos;s telegram SAC. 1911 of the27th April and to such other drafting amendmentsas the Prime Minister might think desirable.AgriculturalPolicy.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)llthConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture and1 Fisheries, the Secretary of State forScotland, the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security andthe Minister of Food (W.P. (44) 218) on the subject of livestock andmilk prices.The Memorandum recalled that at their meeting on the25th January, 1944 (W.M. (44) 11th Conclusions, Minute &apos;2), theWar Cabinet, in authorising an announcement that the Governmentwere prepared to consider extending the system of fixed prices andan assured market for agricultural commodities for the four yearsending with the harvest of 1947, had decided&apos;that the question of
271W.M. 39 (44).making a statement with regard to actual minimum prices forlivestock for the period should be raised again later.This question, together with that of certain proposed increasesin the actual prices of fat cattle and slieep in 1944, had been con-sidered by the Lord Presidents Committee on the 12th April(L.P. (44) 17th Meeting, Conclusion 1), who had approved thefollowing proposals : (i) The Agricultural Ministers should be authorised toannounce that the Government were prepared to offerproducers of milk, fat cattle and sheep a four-yearguarantee of an assured market and of price levels notless than those at present prevailing. In making thisannouncement an explanation should be given of thespecial reasons which had led the Government to offerthis particular guarantee, and it should be emphasisedthat the Government were not prepared to make similaroffers in respect of other agricultural products or tocommit themselves to any given standard of profitabilityfor farmers as a whole until they had had an opportunityto consider comprehensive proposals supported by fullstatistical data. It should also be made clear that theGovernment expected that during the course of the fouryears in question there would have to be some reductionsin the prices of certain agricultural products, such ascereals and potatoes; and(ii) Prices of fat cattle and sheep for the year 1944/45 shouldbe adjusted with a bias towards quality so as to give anaverage increase over the existing prices of 2s. per livecwt. for cattle and of Id. per lb. for sheep, with nochange in the price of wool.The War Cabinet were asked to approve these proposals.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that theadditional cost to the Exchequer of the proposed increases in theprices of cattle and sheep in the year 1944/45 was estimated to beabout  2,400,000. This compared with a claim submitted by theNational Farmers&apos; Union for price increases amounting to about 5,250,000 and an estimate by the Ministry of Agriculture thatincreased costs of production would be around  3,500,000.As indicated in paragraph 6 of W.P. (44) 218, it would be madeclear to the farmers that some reductions in the price of agricul-tural products such as cereals and potatoes must be expected in duecourse. He was anxious that there should be a reduction in theacreages of wheat and potatoes, which would cut out production onmarginal land and so enable reductions to be made in the fixedprices. Owing to the demands of the Minister of Food, however,there was no immediate prospect of a reduction in the potato andwheat acreages.It was not proposed to give any guarantee as to prices of pigsand eggs, since increased production of these products dependedmore on the availability of feeding-stuffs than on prices, and thereWere obvious objections to encouraging production until substan-tially larger supplies of feeding-stuffs became available.The Minister of Food confirmed that, owing to the high demandfor potatoes and the difficulties which were being experienced incarrying out the wheat-loading programme, there was no likelihoodof an early reduction in demands made on the home producer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in generalagreement with the proposals! He stressed, however, that nocommitments should be made as regards fixed prices for otherproducts or with regard to the level of profitability for farmers asa whole.
The War Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Agricultural Ministers to announce that theGovernment were prepared to offer producers of milk,fat cattle and sheep a four-year guarantee up to thesummer of 1948 of an assured market and of price&quot; levelsnot less than those at present prevailing, subject to theconditions set out in paragraph 6 of W.P. (44) 218.(2) Agreed that prices of fat cattle and sheep should beadjusted for the year 1944/45 with a bias towardsquality so as to give an average increase of 2s. per livecwt. for cattle and of Id. per lb. for sheep, with nochange in the price of wool.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
