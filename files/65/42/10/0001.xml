Egypt.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 51stConclusions,Minute 4.)X1. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(W.P. (44) 213) by the Prime Minister circulating a Note by theForeign Office on the political crisis in Egypt.The Prime Minister pointed out that the position which hadarisen was very similar to that which had arisen in May, 1943 (the&quot;black-book&quot; crisis). The present situation was more difficult tothe extent that the King appeared to have a greater degree ofpopular support and that the Greek trouble was still unsettled.We were committed by the 1942 correspondence to refrain frominterference in the internal affairs of Egypt, or in the constitutionor changes of her Government. On the other hand we were underdefinite obligations to Nahas. He was still supported by a verylarge parliamentary majority which made it impossible to justifyhis dismissal on the grounds that he had lost the confidence of thelegislature. Technically the King was, of course, entitled to dismisshis ministry, but it appeared that His Majesty was not preparedto face immediate elections and was concerned to ensure thatHassanein should have time to make arrangements to secure thatan election, when it took place, would maintain him in power. OurAmbassador, who had great experience of Egypt, strongly favouredretaining Nahas in power, or allowing him to go to the polls himself.On the other hand, objections to using force had been urged bythe local Commanders-in-chief.Points taken in the discussion that followed were : (a) The normal term of the Egyptian Parliament was five years :three years of that term was still unexpired. Given that fact andthe Parliamentary majority behind Nahas, he was surely entitled,if the King was unwilling to continue him in office, to an immediateelection.(b) While the record of the Nahas Government was not what itmight be, we were under strong obligations to it for its constantsupport at very difficult times. Nahas might reasonably expectprotection against an endeavour by the Palace so to manipulatematters that he would have no hope of winning an election.(c) King Farouk was certainly more popular than he had beenin Egypt, though outside that country it was doubtful whether therewas really strong Arab feeling in his support. It was undesirable,if it could be avoided, to have to face trouble with the Egyptianarmy at the present time. Nor could we overlook the possiblereactions on Egyptian labour in the ports and the danger of inter-ference with the movement of supplies to Italy.(d) There seemed to be sufficient forces available in Egypt todeal with any troubles that might arise, but the Chiefs of Staff hadasked the local Commanders-in-chief for a considered military,appreciation.After further discussion the Prime Minister suggested to theWar Cabinet that he should send a telegram on the lines that itwould be rash for the King to dismiss a Government supported bya large majority at so early a period in the normal term of thelegislature, and that on grounds of prudence we could not counselhim to do so. If in face of that advice His Majesty insisted onan election, the least he could do would be to give his present PrimeMinister the right to go to the polls. The alternatives were, as theAmbassador had suggested, that Nahas was allowed to go to thepolls or was kept in office.He also though that Lord Killearn should be asked for a fullerindication of his views. The comparison should be, not with thesituation in the Lebanon, but with the very similar situation thathad had to be faced in Egypt in the spring of 1943. It might bepossible for the Ambassador to give some indication of the line onwhich Nahas Pasha&apos;s mind was moving.
The War Cabinet-Endorsed the Prime:Ministers suggestion and agreed thathe should send a telegram to Lord Killearn on the linessuggested at &quot;X,&quot; the terms being settled by the PrimeMinister and the Deputy Prime Minister in consultation.Policy towards 2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum, datedTurkey. the 4th. April, by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Previous        (W.P. (44) 186), reviewing British policy towards Turkey.Reference: The Memorandum concluded by making the following recom-W.M.

Thispolicy would consist of (i) blockade measures, (ii) pre-emption, (iii) generous supply facilities for goods to thesupply of which there was no economic warfare objectionor which would exclude the Germans from the Turkishmarket or enable the Turks to ban exports of their goodsto Germany.(3) We should strive to interrupt communications betweenTurkey and Germany.(4) We must obtain a due measure of agreement from the Sovietand United States Governments in this policy.The Minister of State said that there had been importantdevelopments since the memorandum had been written. The TurkishGovernment had been conducting commercial negotiations with Axissatellites and it had been decided that our Ambassador at Ankara,acting in consultation with the United States Ambassador, shoulddeliver a note to the Turkish Government to the effect that, in viewof the rapidly approaching crisis in the war, when it was essentialthat the enemy should be deprived of all means of resistance, thetwo Governments must revise their attitude towards Turkish traderelations with enemy Powers. It had been made plain that, if theTurkish Government renewed existing agreements with Germanyor her satellites, or entered into fresh agreements on the same lines,we would apply blockade measures such as had been appliedthroughout the neutral countries. The Turkish Government in replyhad stated that collaboration on the lines now requested fitted in withTurkish foreign policy; and that within the limits of their materialpossibilities they would give us the help for which we asked.The Minister of State said that in order to give effect to thispolicy one of the main objects of which was to deprive Germany sofar as possible of supplies of Turkish chrome we should have todo two things : First, we should have to buy Turkish products which wouldotherwise have gone to Germany.Secondly, we should have to furnish Turkey with certainsupplies essential for her economic life.In discussion the question was raised of how supplies of suchgoods would reach Turkey. The Prime Minister enquired theposition as regards the five ships which had been chartered to theTurkish Government after the Adana agreement.The Minister of War Transport said that on instructionsreceived from the Foreign Office, the charter of two ships which had- ; been due to expire had been renewed for two months.
Blockade. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theAnglo-American Minister of Economic Warfare (W.P. (44) 206) dealing with theDifferences differences which had arisen between His Majesty&apos;s Governmentover Blockade and the United States Government in the field of economic warfareMeasures. in relation to Spain and Sweden, and which might shortly extendto Portugal as well.Spain. In the case of Spain, the attitude of the State Department had(Previous so far made agreement over the vital question of wolfram impossible,Reference: and in the view of the Minister of Economic Warfare involved aW.M.(44)41st risk of the failure of our negotiations and, among other things, ofConclusions, the despatch to Germany of the large stocks of wolfram which wereMinute 2.)      now awaiting transport.The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he haddiscussed the Spanish issue with Mr. Stettinius and had also tele-graphed to President Roosevelt. There seemed reason in the resultto hope that it was in a fair way to settlement on lines satisfactoryto us.Sweden. The Memorandum explained that in deference to United Statespressure we had associated ourselves with a demarche to theSwedish Government demanding the immediate cessation of allexports of ball bearings to Germany. The United States Govern-ment were anxious that if the Swedish reply was unsatisfactorywe should agree to black-list the Swedish ball-bearing monopolyThe Prime Minister said that this instruction which shouldhave been brought to his notice before a decision had been given,did not seem to be consistent with the general policy which we hadadopted in regard to Turkey. At the end of January, when negotia-tions with Turkey had been broken off, we had decided to bringpressure to bear on her by adopting a less forthcoming attitude, andin particular by cutting off armament supplies. Generally, hedoubted whether the proposal to make supplies available to Turkeyon the lines now proposed was consistent with the policy towardsthat country which we had pursued since the end of January. Hethought that our policy in regard to Turkey would have to bereviewed and brought before the Cabinet on a later occasion.The following other points were made in discussion : (a) The Prime Minister also pointed out that, owing to the timetaken for chrome exported from Turkey to Germany to affect theflow of finished munitions to the enemy forces, there was no directconnection between exports of chrome to Germany and impendingmilitary events.(b) The War Cabinet was informed that the policy of pre-emption of Turkish products might cost from  5 to  15 million.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he attached greatimportance to our not spending money unnecessarily in pre-emptinggoods, which, owing to increasing disorganisation of communica-tions, the enemy might in any event be unable to transport to centresof production.(c) The Secretary of State for Air said that owing to theimportance now attaching to other targets, he felt that it would beimpracticable to give effect to recommendation (3), namely, that weshould try to interrupt communications between Turkey andGermany by air action.id) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs drew attentionto the latter part of recommendation (1), namely, that no publicstatement should be made on Turkish policy. Lord Vansittart hadput down ia Motion for debate in the Lords on this matter. Hehoped that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs would be ableto dissuade him from proceeding with this Motion at this juncture.The War Cabinet-Agreed to resume consideration of our policy in regard toTurkey at a later meeting.
(S.K.F.), and would themselves proceed to do so should we refuse.The Minister of Economic Warfare recommended that we shoulddecline to black-list the firm, or to acquiesce in any measures (suchas cutting off Swedish rations), which, in our opinion, would justifythe Swedes in denouncing the Anglo-American-Swedish EconomicAgreement negotiated in London in May 1943.The War Cabinet were informed that an offer to buy all ball-I bearings produced by S.K.F. had now been made by the United,, I States Government.   There was general agreement that it wouldI be preferable to await the Swedish reply to this offer beforef threatening to black-list this firm.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note with satisfaction of the Prime Ministers state-ment on the Spanish issue.(2) Invited the Minister of Economic Warfare to discuss theSwedish position further with Mr. Stettinius on the linesindicated at &quot; X.*&apos;The Trotskyist        4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMovement.      Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 202) onthe Trotskyist movement in Great BritainThe memorandum traced the course of the movement in GreatBritain from its beginning in 1929 to its reorganisation in 1944 asthe &quot; Revolutionary Communist Party/&apos; The present membershipof the party was probably well below a thousand; outside Londonit was strongest in Clydeside, and weakest in the Midlands andSouth Wales.It had three newspapers of which the most important wasSocialist Appeal, a fortnightly publication with a circulation of8,000 to 10,000 copies.Its propaganda appeared to be intended to stir up class feelingamong the workers rather than to have any direct effect on the war.It had had some share in the recent strike of engineering apprenticesand in some other wartime strikes, but its activity had consistedrather in advising and encouraging strike leaders than in provokingthe strikes. Its influence was localised and, small, and less in themining than in the engineering industry. Generally, the movementseemed unlikely to rise to a position of any real influence.The War Cabinet-Took note of W.P. (44) 202.UnofficialStrikes.Prayer againstnew DefenceRegulation.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)45thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The War Cabinet was informed that Mr. Aneurin Bevan,M.P., and eight other Members had given notice that they intendedto pray against the recent Order in Council* directed againstpersons instigating and, inciting other persons to take partin strikes or lockouts likely to interfere with essential services.The War Cabinet was informed that it was possible that the prayer,being exempted business, would be taken before the adjournmentof the House on the following day.The War Cabinet agreed that it was important that when thismatter was debated, it should be made clear that the new Regulationhad the full support of the Government. It was accordingly agreedthat the Prime Minister, when announcing the business of theHouse, should state that the Government were prepared to providean opportunity for the matter to be dealt with on Friday, the28th April. It was hoped, but was not certain, that this offer wouldbe accepted. It would be necessary for the Government Whips totake suitable action to ensure that whenever the matter was debatedthe Government supporters were present in good strength.The Prime Minister undertook to consult with the Chief Whipon the matter later that evening.&apos;* S.R. and O. 1944, No. 461, amending Regulation 1a and adding Regula-tion Iaa to.the Defence (General) Regulation, 1939.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,19th April, 1944.
