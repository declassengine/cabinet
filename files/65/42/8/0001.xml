International 1.   The War Cabinet had before them ia Memorandum by theLabour Minister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (44) 197) about theConference.     instructions to be given to the British delegates to the forthcoming(Previous       International Labour Conference in Philadelphia.Kef erenee: The Minister of Labour and National Service explained thatW.M.(4l)l00th it would have been preferable if the proposed Conference had beenConclusions,     deferred until after June; but that, in order to meet the strongMinute 14.)     representations of the United States Government, it had beendecided to start it on the 20th April.   The agenda covered a verywide range of subjects and, having regard to the short time availablefor the preparation of the papers and the difficulties of communica-tions, he had not expected that the proposals to be considered by theConference would cover more than general principles of policy. TheInternational Labour Office had, however, circulated long reportswith detailed proposals covering nearly the whole range of socialpolicy, including much that was purely economic in character, andhad suggested that its proposals should be adopted as formalrecommendations.   Much of the material had arrived only withinthe last few days, so that it had not been possible to examine itthoroughly.   Normally, before formal recommendations were putforward on any subject, a questionnaire was sent to all the Govern -ments concerned so that the recommendations might be drafted inthe light of their replies.   But on this occasion the recommenda-tions put forward were entirely the production of the staff of theInternational Labour Office and included much that was contraryto decisions already taken in this country in regard to such mattersas Health and Unemployment Insurance, Pensions, Workmen&apos;sCompensation, Demobilisation, &amp;c.   Once a recommendation hadbeen accepted it was incumbent on the Governments concerned tosecure its application.   Accordingly, if we acquiesced in the novelprocedure which had been adopted by the International LabourOffice for the present Conference, we should inevitably be placedin an embarrassing position.   In these circumstances, he recom-mended that the British delegates should oppose the proposal thatthe Conference should adopt the recommendations, and shouldsuggest instead a full discussion of the various subjects with a viewto providing for Governments general principles on which theymight have a further chance of expressing their views.  Should thissuggestion not be accepted by the Conference, the British delegatesshould take part in the discussions but abstain from voting.  Withregard to the particular recommendations addressed to the UnitedNations on the subject of present and post-war social policy, thedelegation should resist the intrusion of the International LabourOffice into the field of economic and monetary questions, and shouldendeavour to secure the adoption of a single resolution to the effectthat the International Labour Office should use its influence to securethat national and international measures should be directed toensuring full employment, social security and a rising standard ofliving.. In addition to the recommendations which were to come beforethe Conference, it was proposed that the Conference should considera draft declaration of the aims and purposes of the InternationalLabour Office. The delegation should be authorised to accept thisdeclaration and to vote for any amendment which appears to bewithin its general scope.Draft resolutions dealing with the constitutional practice of theInternational Labour Office, social provisions in the peace settlement,government and administration by the United Nations of Germanyand other totalitarian countries in Europe, and measures for theprotection of transferred foreign workers and of foreign workers&apos;organisations would also come before the Conference. The delega-tion should say that the resolution about the constitutional practiceof the International Labour Office must be considered in relation tothe general discussion of world machinery, should try to limit actionto discussion of its contents and should abstain from voting on it.The delegation should suggest that the remaining three resolutionsshould be referred to the Governments concerned.   It would also
Parliament. 2.   The War Cabinet had a short discussion on ParliamentaryBusiness of the business, in the course of which the following conclusions wereHouse. reached  -(1) The Lord President of the Council should reply on behalfof the Government in the debate on Wednesday, the19th April, on a Motion suggesting that the Govern-ment should spend more money in encouraging scientificteaching and research after the war.(2) In the general debate on Dominion Affairs on Thursday,the 20th, and Friday, the 21st April, the Governmentspokesman should be, on the first day the President ofthe Board of Trade, and on the second day the Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, and the LordPresident of the Council, who would wind up the debate.(3) The general line of Government spokesmen in the debateon Dominion Affairs would be to stress the unity whichhad been shown by the Commonwealth in the presentwar, and to indicate that no definite statement could bemade in anticipation of the Conference of DominionPrime Ministers.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,17^4^,1944.be necessary for the Government to dissociate itself from a statementmade by the International Labour Office in regard to these resolu-tions implying that members of the United Nations should submittheir future international policies in the social field to free discus-sion and decision by all members of the International Organisation,including countries which are not members of the United Nations.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the draftrecommendation on minimum standards of social policy in dependentterritories could probably be made acceptable without very muchamendment, and that, if British delegates were to take the leadin opposing the adoption of a recommendation on this subject whilethe delegates of most other Governments concerned were to welcomethe text, the effect would be unfortunate. He would have preferred,therefore, that the delegates should indicate that the attitude ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government towards the draft recommendation wasgenerally favourable, should stress the wide variety of Colonialconditions, and should press for the recognition of these differencesby a recommendation which would take account of the fact thatthe rate of progress in securing the application of the recommenda-tion must vary with the stage of economic and other developmentreached in each territory. He recognised, however, that it mightbe difficult to adopt this attitude to one of the recommendations ifthe British delegates were to take the general line that theConference ought not to adopt the recommendation.The Prime Minister said that he accepted the view of theMinister of Labour and National Service that the British delegatesshould oppose the proposal that the Conference should adopt therecommendations put forward by the International Labour Office.He hoped, however, that our delegates1 would see to it that the Britishpoint of view was properly presented in the discussions.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he wouldensure that adequate expression was given to the British case andthat the delegation offered all possible assistance to the InternationalLabour Office in carrying out a technical examination of the recom-mendations with a view to their being brought before a furtherConference after they had been examined. He promised to&apos; send tothe Prime Minister a list of the British delegates.The War Cabinet -Agreed that the instructions to the British delegates shouldbe on the lines proposed by the Minister of Labour andNational Service in paragraph 18 of W.P. (44) 197.
