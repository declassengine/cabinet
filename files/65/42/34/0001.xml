Prime 1.   The Prime Minister gave an account of his visit to theMinisters troops in France.

(44) 65thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet thatPresident Roosevelt had at first seen some danger in the proposalthat the Russians should play the major part in dealing withRoumanian affairs and His Majesty&apos;s Government the major part indealing with Greek affairs. He had now agreed to it, on the under-standing that these arrangements would be reviewed in threemonths&apos; time, and that we should be at pains to make it clear thatwe were not establishing any post-war spheres of influence. Hesuggested that the Soviet Government, who had asked for confirma-tion that the United States Government saw no objection to ourproposal for a division of responsibility on these lines, should nowbe informed of United States concurrence, through the diplomaticchannel.The War Cabinet-Took note with satisfaction of the Prime Ministersstatement and invited the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to inform the Soviet Government accordingly.France.(PreviousEef erence:W.M.(44)75thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The. War Cabinet had before them a telegram fromPresident Roosevelt to the Prime Minister about the line to betaken with the French National Committee in regard to the specialcurrency which had been issued by the Supreme Allied Commanderfor use by the Allied forces in France, and the text of a formalprotest in this matter which had been received from the FrenchNational Committee.A discussidn took place on this matter, and on the connectedquestion of relations with General de Gaulle and the FrenchNational Committee.The conclusions reached by the War Cabinet were as follows : (1) That President Roosevelt&apos;s telegram to the Prime Ministerof the 13th June, No. 559,* took insufficient account ofthe following : 1(i) the difficulties caused by the absence on the currencynotes of any indication of the authority by whichthey were issued;(ii) the danger that, if issued without any under-standing with the French authorities, the UnitedKingdom and the United States would be morallyresponsible for honouring them;(iii) the fact that unilateral issue would leave us liableto carry burdens which, under the financialarrangement contemplated with the French Com-mittee, would be borne by the French authoritieson the principle of mutual aid;and that these matters should be taken up with theUnited States Government.* This telegram suggested that we should carry on with this currency asplanned; that if it was not acceptable to the French public General Eisenhowerwould have fu.ll authority to use yellow seal dollars and British militaryauthority notes; and that any adverse consequences that might flow from theemployment of such notes would be the responsibility of General de Gaulle and.&apos;the French Committee of National Liberation. - ,
