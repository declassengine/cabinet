Its resources had been placed at the disposalKhan Noon. of the Allied cause on most generous terms, and its troops hadrendered fine service, notably in the Abyssinian campaign. Kashmirhad also made very valuable contributions in the field of supply.The Prime Minister said that the presence of His Highness theMaharaja and of Sir Firoz Khan Noon at the councils of the WarCabinet would be most welcome at this time.The Maharaja thanked the Prime Minister for what he hadsaid.Naval, Militaryand AirOperations.(PreviousReference:W.M,(44)47thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Crossbow &quot;Targets.MediterraneanNavalOperationsIndia.MediterraneanMilitaryOperations.*E.ussia.:Burma.2. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bad weather had interfered with bomber operations, and theonly important attack had been against Aachen. United Statesbombers had had a satisfactory week. Coastal Command hadsighted four U-boats, all of which had been attacked.The Allied Expeditionary Forces and the Tactical Air Forcehad made 7,000 sorties, attacking railway centres and airfields inoccupied territory. Enemy losses claimed for the week amounted to274 aircraft destroyed in the air and 150 on the ground. Alliedlosses amounted to 120 bombers (108 of which were American),76 fighters and 5 Coastal Command aircraft.The attacks on &quot; Crossbow &quot; targets had been hampered byweather.The Prime Minister said that he thought that more effortshould be concentrated on these targets in the near future.The Chief of the Air Staff agreed, and said that the Chiefs ofStaff intended to deal with the matter on these lines at theirmeeting on the following day.8,700 sorties had been flown by the Allied air forces.Communications in Italy, industrial targets at Vienna andBudapest and also harbours and airfields had been attacked. Anumber of ships had been sunk and damaged in the Adriatic andthe iEgean. Enemy losses amounted to 86 aircraft as against54 Allied.Losses by enemy action reported in April amounted to22,264 tons. Seven German U-boats had been sunk so far in Apriland 2 probably sunk. The return convoy from Russia had arrivedwithout incident.An ammunition ship had blown up in the Victoria Docks,Bombay, and had caused great destruction, including the sinkingof some 11 merchant ships, totalling 48,000 tons, and damage toothers of a total tonnage of 19,217 tons. In addition, a number ofnaval stores had been destroyed and congestion caused to dockingfacilities. The total number of casualties was not yet known, butit was thought that some 1,000-1,200 had been killed or severelywounded.   The naval casualties had been slight.The Anzio discharges had averaged 3,370 tons per daythroughout the week.In the north only minor Russian attacks had been reported bythe Germans. The Russians had captured Tarnopol, although theGermans had fought hard to retain this pivotal position. TheGermans had, however, succeeded in relieving their forces in theSkala neighbourhood. Further south the Russians now held the lineof the Dniester from Kishinev to Tiraspol, and had succeeded inestablishing a few small bridgeheads. In the Crimea remnants ofthe German and Roumanian forces had been driven into Sebastopol,whence the enemy were attempting to evacuate by sea. The Russianshad taken some 40,000 prisoners to date.In the Imphal area the Japanese thrust towards Imphal fromthe south had made no progress; their attack from the east had been[27370-2] b 2
held and driven back in some places. The third thrust from Ukhrulhad also made little progress. The Long-Range Penetration Grouphad continued to destroy the railway line near Indaw. Our totalcasualties on the Burma Front from the 15th October, 1943, to the8th April had been 10,600.!New Guinea. Australian  forces   from  the  Ramu  Valley  had  capturedBogadjim, and had made contact with United States forces whichhad advanced along the coast from Saidor.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Russia.Warships.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)40thConclusions,Minute 2.)3.   Arising out of the discussion of the previous item, the WarLoan of British Cabinet was informed that arrangements were now being made fora number of Russian officers and men to come to this country inorder to take over certain warships on loan.The Prime Minister said that he was sure that special precau-tions would be taken by the Admiralty to ensure adequate convoyfor the ships carrying these officers and men. Steps would no doubtalso be taken by the Admiralty to arrange suitable hospitality.The Prime Minister said that we should also consider whatpublic announcement could appropriately be made in regard to thismatter. On the whole, he was in favour of a measure of publicity,but it must be borne in mind that the Russians might object topublicity of any kind until the warships had got back safely toRussian ports.The First Sea Lord said that he thought that the Admiraltywould not object to publicity, provided neither the names nor theclass of warships were specified.The Prime Minister suggested, and the War Cabinet agreed,that the Minister of Information should examine the question ofpublicity in consultation with the First Lord of the Admiralty.Foreign Affairs.Greece.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)47thConclusions,Minute 2.)Italy.(PreviousReference:W.M, (44) 43rdConclusions,Minute 4.)France.(PreviousReference:W.M,(44)47thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Prime Minister passed in review the main develop-ments in foreign affairs.The Greek position was definitely better. The King hadarrived in Cairo and had- made an enlightened declaration. Themutinous troops were being dealt with, and he anticipated an earlyand satisfactory result, following which he thought that the troublein the Navy would also come to an end.The Italian position was also very satisfactory. All the sixParties had now intimated their readiness to join the Governmentunder Marshal Badoglio. Count Sforza and Sr. Croce werebelieved to be ready to accept office in it.General Giraud had now definitely decided not to accept thepost offered to him by General de Gaulle and had been informedthat we would be prepared to allow him to come to this country withhis daughter if he so desired. It had been suggested that Generalde Gaulle might visit the United States. If this could be arranged^he thought this would be of value.Further reference was made to the desire of the FrenchCommittee of National Liberation to establish their position inrelation to civil affairs when the liberation of French MetropolitanTerritories started.The Prime Minister thought that the matter was one in whicha little delay would do no harm. ..
Egypt. The King had informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that he was(Previous dissatisfied with the maladministration and corruption of hisReference:        present Government under Nahas Pasha.   Nahas Pasha himselfW.M.(43)66th    was alleged to have trespassed in ceremonial matters on the RoyalConclusions,      Prerogative during a recent tour.  The King was anxious to replaceMinute 1.)        him by Hassanein Bey, who belonged to the Palace Party, pendingthe outcome of elections.   Given the consistent support which theNahas Government had lent to His Majesty&apos;s Government, particu-larly when the enemy threat to Cairo was most marked, and givenalso the critical nature of the issues that faced His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the near future, it seemed very undesirable that weshould agree to a change at the present stage.  The Prime Ministerthought that the matter should be handled on these lines.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the view expressed by the Prime Minister.&quot; Overlord &quot;Security.Censorship ofDiplomaticcommunicationsfrom thiscountry.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)48thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Permanent Undersecretary of State for ForeignAffairs reported that the censorship of communications to and fromall neutral and Allied diplomats in this country (other than theUnited States and U.S.S.R.) would take effect from midnight thatnight, and that warning had been given to those concerned thatafternoon.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,17th April, 1944.
