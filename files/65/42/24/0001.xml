He wassure that his colleagues would wish him to express toMr. Mackenzie King their gratitude for the great help whichCanada had given in the war.Mr. Mackenzie King said that it had given him very greatpleasure indeed to attend the meetings of Dominion Prime Ministersand of the War Cabinet.

The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the draft ofFrance. a telegram which he proposed to send to the President, informing(Previous him of his intention to send a cordial invitation to General de GaulleReference: to come to this country after &quot;Overlord&quot; had been launched inW.M.(44)60th order to discuss arrangements for collaboration in the civil adminis-Conclusions, tration of French territory. In the meantime General Koenig andMinute 4.) &apos;     M. Vienot would be allowed to send a certain number of cyphermessages, provided that they gave an indication of the contents ofthe messages and an assurance that no attempt would be made to.include, any information about military affairs other than thoseaffecting French troops.The Prime Minister added that he proposed to ask GeneralWilson to take General de Gaulle into his full confidence withregard to the military operations in Italy.The question was also raised of what action should be takenwith regard to declaration of the Assembly in Algiers that the-French Committee of National Liberation&apos; should in future bedescribed as the Provisional Government of France.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out thatthe declaration of the establishment of a Provisional Governmentwas contrary to the decree passed by the French Committee ofNational Liberation. Until we received an official intimation ofthe change, however, we were not called upon to take any action.This point might be brought out in the Prime Ministers telegramto the President, which could also indicate that meanwhile ouraction remained regulated by the terms of recognition which we,in unison with the United States, had already given to theCommittee, and that we should consult the United States Govern-ment before adopting any change of policy.The War Cabinet Agreed to the despatch of the telegram, subject to amend-ment to meet the point referred to at &quot; X.&quot;The Prime Minister referred to the message which had beenreceived from the representatives of E.A.M., and asked theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs to arrange for its publicationbefore the foreign affairs debate in the following week.Mr. Yencken.

He was consideringwhether this telegram might be published.Greece.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)65thConclusions,Minute 3.)
EmploymentPolicy.EmploymentPolicy.Publicity forWhite Paper.. 3. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Reconstruction (W.P. (44) 254) covering a draft WhitePaper outlining a policy for maintaining employment after the war.In his covering note the Minister explained that this Paperwas based on a report by a Committee of officials under thechairmanship of Sir Richard Hopkins, the recommendations ofwhich had been exhaustively discussed by the ReconstructionCommittee. The draft White Paper had the unanimous support ofthe Reconstruction Committee, subject to one point.&apos;Discussion of the draft White Paper centred on three points : (a) Reference was made to the proposal in paragraph 72 ofthe White Paper that rates of taxation should be varied for thepurpose of maintaining employment. Some Ministers on theReconstruction Committee had been impressed by the politicaldangers which this method involved, and would have preferred thatthe Paper should include no reference to it.The War Cabinet decided that the suggestion&apos;should stand, inthe form embodied in paragraph 72.(b) The Minister of Reconstruction read to the War Cabinet adraft passage about Government orders for consumer goods, whichhe and the Chancellor of the Exchequer wished to insert afterparagraph 72.   This addition was accepted.(c) The Lord Privy Seal said that, while otherwise in fullagreement with the proposals in the Paper, he thought that thesuggestions for stimulating private capital investment during timesof depression did not go far enough. The reluctance to embark onprivate capital expenditure at such times would not, he thought,be overcome by variation of interest rates. He would like to see thispart of the scheme strengthened by the addition of some methodwhich would offer greater inducements to undertake capitalexpenditure at the onset of a depression, with a view to evening outthe fluctuations in private investment.It was agreed that the Minister of Reconstruction shouldconsider whether the relevant paragraphs could be strengthened.Subject to the modifications indicated at (b) and (c), the WarCabinet-Approved the White Paper and agreed that it should bepresented to Parliament in the following week.4. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Information (W.P. (44) 256) making proposals for thehandling of the initial publicity for the White Paper.The War Cabinet were unable to agree to an advancedistribution of the White Paper to the Press, even on the under-standing that there should be no public reference to the contentsuntil the paper had been presented to the House of Commons. Itwas felt that, more particularly in the case of a document of thisimportance, the House would expect that Members should havecopies of the White Paper before it was issued to the Press.The arrangements for publicity would therefore have to be onthe following lines. Copies of the White Paper might be availablein the Vote Office at an early hour, say, at 11 a.m. Thereafter, theLobby Correspondents, and probably also another gathering of PressCorrespondents, should be addressed by the Minister ofReconstruction. The Press (Including the provincial Press) shouldbe informed well in advance of the hour at which copies would beavailable, so that their representatives could be present at theseconferences. A special summary of the Paper should be prepared,as proposed by the Minister of Information.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,19th May, 1944.
