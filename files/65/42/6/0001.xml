Yugoslavia.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)35thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet the latestinformation about the political situation in Yugoslavia. This isrecorded m the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War CabinetConclusions.Poland&apos;sNational Day.(PreviousReference:W.M.(43)62ndConclusions.)2. The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs reminded the War Cabinet that Poland&apos;s National Daywould be celebrated on the 3rd May. A year ago the Lord Presidentof the Council (Sir John Anderson) had spoken at the celebration.The Polish Government did not expect that either the PrimeMinister or the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs would be ableto speak at this year&apos;s celebration, but they hoped that no objectionwould be raised to them inviting some other Minister to speak.The War Cabinet-Agreed that it would be desirable that a Minister shouldmake a speech on this year&apos;s celebration, and askedSir Alexander Cadogan to inform the Polish Governmentthat the Minister of Labour and National Service would bewilling to accept an invitation to speak on this occasion.&quot; Overlord &quot;Security.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)31stConclusions,Minute 2.)Man-Power.(PreviousReferences:W.M. (44)37thConclusions,andW.M. (44) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet of certainfurther measures which it was proposed to take in connection with&quot; Overlord &quot; security. The conclusions reached are recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Ministerof Production (W.P. (44) 173) on the subject of Man-powerRequirements for the Japanese war.The Minister of Production explained that, at his request, theChiefs of Staff and the Joint War Production Staff had workedout provisional estimates of the man-power requirements of theServices and the shipbuilding and munition industries one yearafter the defeat of Germany, based on the assumption that theJapanese war would last for three years thereafter. The estimates,details of which were given in an Appendix to W.P. (44) 173,showed that the man-power required would be 6-5 million. Thismeant that the man-power mobilisation one year after the end ofthe German war would be 75 per cent, of the end-1944 level and asgreat as the mobilisation in the middle of 1941. This figure wasdependent on our continuing to receive at least 40 per cent, of ourmunition supplies from overseas, and it was not certain that thisproportion would be maintained, although he was making everyeffort to ensure that it would be.In his view, the pressing demands of the building programme,the need to improve civilian standards, the essential repair andmaintenance of industrial installations and the needs of the exporttrade would make it impossible to sustain the scale of effort onwhich the estimates were based. At the end of the war withGermany large numbers of persons released from the Services andfrom munition work would not be available for civilian employmentand it would be impossible to use the war-time powers of directionof labour to the same extent. He therefore proposed that the WarCabinet should assume a basis for fresh estimates that the extent ofour war mobilisation should be limited to a level between 60 per cent,and 65 per cent, of the end-1944 level, i.e., a Service-plus-munitionman-power level of 5-5 million, of which , 3 million wouldtentatively be allocated to the Services and 2-5 million to themunition labour force.  The Chiefs of Staff should be asked to work
out the effect of this assumption on their military intentions forthe Japanese war and on their other commitments, including theoccupation of Europe, while the Joint War Production Staff wouldestimate the effect of trying to meet the requirements of thereduced Forces with a munition labour force of 2-5 million. Atthe same time, the Minister of Reconstruction and the Minister ofLabour and National Service with himself and other Ministersresponsible for the various sections of the civil economy should beasked to make an assessment of the extent to which urgent recon-struction plans could be met on the new assumption.The Minister of Production pointed out that the calculationsalready made had been based on the assumption that the Japanesewar would continue for three years after the end of the Germanwar, and asked the War Cabinet whether it would not be wise tomake some change in this assumption for planning purposes.The Minister of Labour anal National Service said that he wasat present engaged in the preparation of a man-power budget forthe year following the end of the German war. He agreed with theMinister of Production that it would be impossible to sustainthe scale of effort represented by the estimates which had been madeby the Chiefs of Staff and the Joint War Production Staff, andsupported the proposal that fresh estimates should be made on thelines proposed in W.P. (44) 173. With regard to the extent towhich labour would be available for urgent reconstruction workafter the end of the German war, he pointed out that, although onthe basis of the estimates made in W.P. (44) 173 there would be anet reduction of 2-2 million in the Services and in munitions work,the fact that many persons would retire or be unwilling to remainin industry made it likely that the total available additional man-power for essential civilian tasks would not be more than 900,000.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that theplans on which the estimates made by the Chiefs of Staff had beenbased contemplated that relatively small land forces would beemployed in the Japanese war. The requirements of forces foroccupation of enemy territories in Europe must, however, also betaken into account, and it had not been possible to obtain anyreliable information as to the extent of our responsibilities in thisregard. If more precise information could be provided about ourcommitment in Europe after the German war, it would help greatlyin the preparation of revised estimates.The following points were made in discussion :  (a) The  President  of  the  Board  of  Trade   stressed  theimportance of making some improvement in the civilianstandards of consumption and of taking action to reviveour export trade after the end of the German war.(b) The   Paymaster-General   suggested   that   it   might   bedesirable to ask the Chiefs of Staff and the Joint WarProduction Staff to make alternative estimates on thebasis of a limit of 2 - 5 million on the Services man-powerwith a corresponding limit on the munition labour force.Even on the assumption proposed in paragraph 6 ofW.P. (44) 173, it seemed unlikely that we should havethe necessary man-power to carry out essential civiliantasks in the immediate period after the defeat ofGermany.(c) The Secretary of State for Air stressed the importance ofavoiding any suggestion that we did not intend toprosecute the war against Japan with all the resourcesat our disposal.(d) The First Lord of the Admiralty reminded the WarCabinet that a considerable part of the labour force ofthe Supply Ministries was engaged in production forcivil purposes (e.g., merchant shipbuilding). This hada bearing on the reductions which could be made whenGermany had been defeated.
221 W.M. 48&quot;(44).The Prime Minister said that, while we were committed to dothe utmost in our power to prosecute the war against Japan, andwhile everything possible would be done by propaganda to maintainour war effort, it was clear that the geographical limitations on theforces which could be deployed against Japan were such thatsubstantial reductions should be possible in Services man-power.So far as the occupation of Europe was concerned, it should bepossible to carry out the necessary tasks with relatively small forces.Moreover, a much smaller labour force would be sufficient to providesupplies for the armies of occupation. With regard to the questionof what length should be assumed for the Japanese war, he thoughtthat, subject to the views of the Chiefs of Staff, it would bereasonable to take a figure of two years instead of three years as abasis for planning.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chiefs of Staff and the Joint War ProductionStaff to prepare revised plans on the lines proposed inW.P. (44) 173. In the preparation of these plans itshould be assumed that the Japanese war would last fortwo years after the defeat of Germany. Full accountshould be taken of the geographical limitations on thedeployment of forces against Japan, of the extent towhich armies of occupation made lighter demands onman-power and supplies and of the savings in produc-tion which, after allowing a reasonable insurance, couldbe made by the use of accumulated stores.(2) Agreed that the Ministers of Reconstruction, Labour andNational Service, and Production, together with otherMinisters concerned, should examine the extent to whichessential civilian requirements would make demands onman-power in the first year after the defeat of Germany.(3) Took note that the Minister of Labour and National Servicewas preparing a Man-Power Budget for the yearfollowing the German war.(4) Agreed that the matter should be further reviewed whenthe reports referred to in (1), (2) and (3) had beenprepared.21London Airfieldfor TransportServices.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)16thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. At their meeting on the 7th February, 1944, the WarCabinet had had a preliminary discussion on a report by aCommittee of Ministers presided over by the Lord President(W.P. (44) 73) on a scheme for the establishment of a new airfieldat Heathrow capable of accommodating heavy transport aircraftof the latest type. The report had recommended that the AirMinistry should be authorised to proceed with work on stages 1and 2 of the proposed scheme, but doubt had been expressed as towhether immediate action was justified.The War Cabinet now had before them a further Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (44) 189). The Memo-randum embodied revised proposals, under which the Air Ministrywould (i) Start at once constructing one runway of 3,000 yards,followed by two runways of 2,000 yards,(ii) When these were completed, extend the main runway to5,000 yards and the other two runways to 3,000 yards.The revised proposal would result in a reduction of labourduring the &quot; Overlord &quot; period by as much as one-third.The Secretary of State for Air said that the need for anadequate airfield for transport aircraft for war purposes was ofgreat urgency. New heavy transport aircraft shortly expected inthis country would require accommodation which could not satis-factorily be provided,  save  on the basis of these  proposals.
Alternative sites and methods of producing the required accommo-dation had been examined, but without producing a satisfactorysolution. Moreover, the revised scheme now put forward wouldinvolve a greatly reduced labour force.The Prime Minister expressed doubt as to the justification forproceeding with the scheme at the present moment.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the case for thisproposal was weaker now than when first put up, since the heaviesttype of transport aircraft envisaged were not now expected to bein use before 1947. Moreover, no satisfactory alternative site hadyet been found for the Middlesex County Sludge Disposal Works,which at present were an obstacle to the completion of the scheme.He enquired whether it would not be possible to lengthen orotherwise adapt an existing airfield say, Northolt, Prestwick orLyneham.The Secretary of State for Air said that this last possibilityhad already been fully examined, but none of the alternativesreferred to would meet the case. While accommodation for theheaviest type of transport aircraft would not now be immediatelyneeded, accommodation would still be required this year for heavytransport aircraft. His advisers were seriously concerned aboutthe safety of present air transport arrangements, and he pressedstrongly that the present proposals should be sanctioned at once.Under these proposals the removal of the Sludge Works could bepostponed, and the requisite labour (which would probably notexceed 2,000 men at any time during the present year) would befound out of the Ministry&apos;s allocation for building labour.After further discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that work should be put in hand at once, as pro-posed by the Secretary of State for Air, on the provisionof a 3,000 yards runway at Heathrow, to be followed bytwo runways of 2,000 yards, on the understanding thatnot more than 2,000 men would be employed on the workat any time during the present year.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,13th April, 1944.
