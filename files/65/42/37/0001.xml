Air Raids.Attack byPilotlessAircraft.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 77thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The War Cabinet discussed the attack by pilotiess aircraftwhich had been made by the enemy on the previous night.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthe attack had been much heavier than that made on the night ofthe 12th June. First reports showed that about 50&apos; persons hadbeen killed and 400 injured, but later reports would probably showa larger number of casualties. In view of the weight and extentof the attack, he had, with the approval of the Prime Minister,made a statement in the House at the beginning of business. TheLeader of the House had also made a statement dealing with thequestion of sittings of the House.In view of the relatively low speed with.which the aircraftapproached, the existing warning system appeared to be adequate,although it might have to be modified in the light of experience.The missiles seemed to give rise to extensive rather than intensiveblast damage.While it is true that the attacks were no worse than the airraids of last February, undoubtedly their nuisance value was high,and he urged that everything possible should be done to minimisethem by dealing with the sites from Avhich they were launched.The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff reported that the attack hadbeen made with about 150 aircraft, 50 of which had fallen in thegreater London area, the rest in a broad belt extending across theHome Counties. They had come from the general direction of thePas de Calais, and the enemy appeared to be using ahout 40 sites.Normally the aircraft appeared to fly from 1,000 to 4,000 feet, sothat they were well within range of light anti-aircraft guns orballoons, and their speed made them very vulnerable to fighter attack.Preliminary reports suggested that about 11 of the aircraft had beenshot down, by fighters and 12 by anti-aircraft guns. The enemy hadalso sent over a small number of piloted aircraft.The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Anti-AircraftCommand said that according to present information 29 aircrafthad been claimed as brought down by anti-aircraft fire. A fairnumber had exploded in the air. Immediate steps were being takento strengthen the belt of defence South of London, and it was hopedthat as a result the protection afforded by it would be greatlyincreased. On the results of the previous night he was convincedthat it was desirable, at least until further experience had beengained, to continue to use anti-aircraft guns against pilotlessaircraft even in the London area, despite the risk of bringing downin the built-up area aircraft which might otherwise pass over.The Minister of Aircraft Production pointed out that theunusual nature of the attacks had led to a certain amount ofuneasiness among the workers in war factories. It was to be hopedthat the statement made by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security would reassure workers, and it would be necessaryfor the Ministry of Information to do what they could to encourageworkers to continue full production.The Secretary of State for Air recalled that a great deal ofeffort had already been expended in attacks on the &quot; ski sites &quot; forthe launching of pilotless aircraft. In accordance with the decisiontaken at the War Cabinet meeting on the 13th June (W:M. (44)77th Conclusions, Minute 5) a request had been made to the SupremeCommander to attack the supply sites and all the modified pilotlessaircraft sites capable of operation, in so far as this was possiblewithout prejudicing in any way the urgent needs of the Battle ofFrance. It might be better to concentrate attacks mainly on thesupply sites, rather than on the modified sites which presented verysmall targets.The Prime Minister stressed the importance of avoiding anysuggestion that work should be interrupted because of the attacks.It was, of course, proper that people should take shelter when therewas imminent danger, but the sounding of the siren should be[27681] b 2
regarded only as an alert and not as a signal that work should beinterrupted. It was important that the public should be givenguidance in that sense. The warning system should also be reviewedwith a view to ensuring that warnings were not sounded merelybecause of the presence of isolated aircraft.In further discussion it was generally agreed that whilenothing must be done which would prejudice in any way the needsof the Battle of France, the nuisance value of the attacks was suchthat every effort should be made to put out of action the sites fromwhich they were launched. The Prime Minister said that he wouldtake up this aspect of the matter at a Staff meeting with theSupreme Commander or his representative.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that it was important that there should be the leastpossible interruption of work owing to these attacks.The necessary instructions should be issued to Govern-ment Departments.(2) Guidance should also be given to the public on this matter,and on the precautions which they should take to meetthis new form of attack. The Home Secretary andMinister of Home Security was invited to prepare andsubmit to the Prime Minister a statement for theguidance of the public.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would hold a StaffConference at 5 p.m. that evening to consider measuresto counter attacks by pilotless aircraft.At the Staff Conference held at 5 p.m. the same afternoon, thefollowing conclusions were reached : The Conference agreed&apos; -(1) To request the Supreme Commander, Allied ExpeditionaryForce, to take all possible measures to neutralise thesupply and launching sites, subject to no interferencewith the essential requirements of the battle in France.(2) That the air raid warning should not be sounded on theapproach of a single pilotless aircraft. At night, thesounding of the siren should be reduced to the minimumand the warning should be sounded only on the approachof the first &quot; covey.&quot;(3) That, for the time being, pending further experience, theanti-aircraft guns, both inside and outside the Londonarea, should continue to engage pilotless aircraft.(4) That the Air Marshal Commanding, A.D.G.B., in consulta-tion with the G.O.C.-in-C, Anti-Aircraft Command,should redistribute the gun, searchlight and balloondefences, as necessary to counter the attacks.(5) That the Air Marshal Commanding A.D.G.B. shouldconsider the use of armed cables on those balloonsdeployed against pilotless aircraft.Oil. 2.   The War Cabinet had before them 1(1) The Report of the Special Oil Committee (W.P. (44) 313)appointed consequent on the Conclusions of the WarCabinet at their Meeting on the 31st May (W.M. (44)70th Conclusions, Minute 1);(2) A Memorandum bv the Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (44)324); and(3) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs (W.P. (44) 328) suggesting certain amendmentsin the draft Memorandum of Understanding supple-mentary to those recommended by the Special OilCommittee.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Report of theSpecial Oil Committee was unanimous.   It was based on very full(PreviousEef erence:W.M.(44)70thConclusions,Minute 1.)
discussion, and it proposed the insertion in the draft Memorandumof Understanding of words to safeguard our supply position andour military position. The Committee thought it essential to takethis occasion to make our position perfectly clear to the Americans.We claimed the right to meet our own requirements from our ownproduction, and to the extent that we might not exercise such rightto have consideration given to our claims elsewhere. We should befree under the Agreement as amended to develop our propertiesand to have the right to claim that our own oil should supply ourown market, though, of course, the oil which we claimed as ourswas not all produced in British territory. From the point of viewof sterling exchange it was vital that we should safeguard ourinterests in respect of oil, and he thought that that position hadbeen secured by the additions to the draft Memorandum nowproposed. He reminded the War Cabinet that the Memorandumof Understanding involved no binding commitments on the twoGovernments.The Lord Privy Seal thought that the Memorandum ofUnderstanding, as modified by the Special Oil Committee, wouldmeet the case so long as there was a strong and determined effort onour part to carry out its terms. Fie had been disturbed byLord Halifax&apos;s telegram No. 3212, which reported that Mr. Ickeshad said that we might have a first lien over our own resources forsecurity reasons. That suggested that before a really satisfactoryunderstanding could be reached with the United States over oil,there must be a radical alteration in their attitude. He feared acartel and endeavours by the United States to raise the price of oilin the British market. We otight to have the right to develop ourown market to the extent of our own resources, even if we did notat this stage use that right.The Minister of War Transport said that he thought that ourposition would be sufficiently protected if the United States acceptedthe changes which the Oil Committee had recommended in theMemorandum. He was, however, uneasy on two grounds, first, thatthe United States might refuse to accept our amendments; secondly,that the adoption in regard to oil of the line now proposed mightseriously prejudice our position in other matters, e.g., shipping.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out the inconsistenciesbetween the attitude adopted in this matter at various times by theUnited States. We were perfectly entitled to protect our ownexpansion in view of the anxiety of the United States to acquirefurther oil resources abroad, particularly in the Persian Gulf area,in order that after the war they might conduct their exportoperations from foreign fields, and protect the home market byceasing to export from home.The Secretary of State for India felt that the essential pointwas that we should not have to buy dear dollar oil instead of cheapsterling oil. The amendments proposed by the Committee wouldprotect our position. We were entitled to claim a position ofequality on broad general grounds in this matter with the UnitedStates, and to enjoy the same right over oil in our disposition asthey did over theirs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he saw no objection tothe amendments suggested by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs in W.P. (44) 328, and suggested that the War Cabinet mightauthorise him to settle their exact wording with the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs and thereafter to inform the membersof the Special Oil Committee.After further discussion, the War Cabinet (1) Accepted the recommendation of the Special Oil Committeethat exception need not be taken to the terms of the draftMemorandum of Understanding subject to the amend-ments proposed by the Special Oil Committee inW.P. (44) 313, and that negotiations should now go
forward on the basis of the instructions which theCommittee recommended.(2) Took note of the recommendation of the Special OilCommittee as regards the basis for the conduct ofnegotiations with the United States Government(W.P. (44) 313, paragraph 16).(3) Approved generally the amendments&apos; to the draft Memo-randum proposed by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs in W.P. (44) 328, and invited the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer to settle, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, the wording ofthose amendments and the point at which they shouldbe inserted in the draft Memorandum.Empire 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theTelecom-        Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (44) 309) and a memorandummunications     by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (44) 318).Service. In his memorandum the Chancellor of the Exchequer statedthat the Commonwealth Communications Council, in an interimreport to the Governments of the Empire dated the 10th May, 1944,had recommended the conversion of the present system, under whichthe telecommunications services of the Empire were mainlyconducted by companies, into a system under which the privateshareholder interest would be eliminated. This would mean settingup a series of public utility corporations in the United Kingdom,Dominions and India, responsible for the operation of thetelecommunications services in their respective countries and allfinancially interlocked.After referring to the main issues involved, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer recommended that a detailed examination of thisscheme should be made by the Ministers concerned.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in his memo-randum supported this proposal with a view to a decision as to theadoption of the scheme, if acceptable to all the other Governments,being taken as early as possible.In discussion, the Lord Privy Seal expressed grave doubts as tothe wisdom of entrusting the telecommunications services of theEmpire to public utility corporations. He thought that Cables andWireless, Ltd., had done very good work subject to the rigidlimitations imposed on them. In his view any enquiry into thismatter should have sufficiently wide terms of reference to enableconsideration to be given to the part which should be played inEmpire telecommunications services by private enterprise and bypublic utility corporations.The War Cabinet agreed &apos;(1) That a committee comprised of The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman),The Lord President of the Council,The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for India,The Secretary of State for the Colonies, andThe Postmaster-Generalshould carry out a detailed examination into the issuesraised by the recommendations of the CommonwealthCommunications Council in their report dated the10th May, 1944, as to the future organisation oftelecommunications services throughout the Common-wealth.(2) That an early statement should be made in the House ofCommons about the report and the position of the UnitedKingdom in regard to it.
(3) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should beinvited to consider the United States aspect of thetelecommunications problem, and advise the Ministersconcerned.4. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet thatPresident Roosevelt, after consultation with his advisers in theUnited States and in the field, now thought, despite some surprisethat the Deputy President of the Control Commission hadapparently acted without consulting the other Allied Governments,that it would be a grave mistake not to permit the Bonomi Cabinetto be promptly installed. He (the Prime Minister) and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs felt that the wise course would be toaccept Signor Bonomi subject, however, to our assuring ourselvesthat he had full knowledge of and accepted the commitments whichwould have to be undertaken by the new Government. It wasimportant that there should be no misunderstanding as regards theiracceptance of the long Armistice Terms, and he thought there wouldbe advantage in publishing those terms. If the War Cabinetapproved action on these lines, he would telegraph to Premier Stalinthrough the personal channel.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that M. Molotovwas being informed through the official channel of the President^attitude and of our views. He undertook to prepare the draft ofa personal telegram from the Prime Minister to Premier Stalin.The War Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister andapproved the course of action recommended by himat &quot;X.&quot;The Prime Minister said that he was a little uneasy as to theeffect on President Roosevelt of General de Gaulle&apos;s action indescribing himself during his visit to France as President of theProvisional Government. Again, the Press in Algiers was verycritical of the United States attitude. At a time when the UnitedStates was making so great a contribution to the liberation ofFrance, this might give rise to misunderstanding in America.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that HisMajesty&apos;s Representative in Algiers had already been asked to givea hint to the local press. The preliminary investigations made bythe Foreign Office as to the drafting of a Civil Affairs Agreementbased on the Algiers Decree suggested that it might be possible tosecure agreement with the French on this matter, without raising the&quot;Provisional Government&quot; issue. If that were so, that wouldcontribute to easing President Roosevelfs mind.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it lookedas though the conversations between the Ban of Croatia andMarshal Tito had opened well. The Ban was returning to reportto King Peter, who would then have to decide on the next step.The War Cabinet-Took note of the above statement.5. Reference was made to a case reported in the Press, inwhich it was alleged that a woman, not in uniform, after resistancehad ceased, had shot at and wounded Canadian troops. It wasstated that this woman had now been brought to this country andwas to be interned as an enemy alien.
The view was expressed that prison, rather than internment,was appropriate in a case of this kind. If there were any difficultiesin putting the woman on trial in this country for an offencecommitted out of this realm, it was suggested that she might betaken back to France and tried there by military courts. Should shebe found guilty, she could then be brought to this country to servea sentence of imprisonment in gaol.The Secretary of State for India urged that care should betaken to make absolutely sure that such sniping by members of thelocal civil population had in fact taken place. In the last war asimilar rumour was prevalent about Belgians, and he had himself,on one occasion intervened to save six innocent persons whoseexecution had already been ordered by a Brigade commander.The War Cabinet-Asked that their views on this matter should be broughtto the notice of the authorities concerned.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,16th June, 1944.
