Recruitment 1. -The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by. thefor the Indian Secretary of State for India (W.P. (44) 287) proposing, as soon asCivil Service military considerations permit, the resumption of recruitment forand Indian the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Police broadly on the linesPolice. hitherto  followed,  but  subject  to  two  modifications:    (i) theinclusion in the regulations of a clear warning that candidatesrecruited under them would be liable to have their appointmentsterminated at any time after an appropriate period of notice if, asa result of constitutional changes, it became necessary to dispensewith their services; and (ii) that the appointment of recruits wouldno longer be on the basis of pensionable service but of contributionto a provident fund, combined with the assurance of a gratuity inthe event of such discharge, graduated according to the length ofservice rendered.The Secretary of State for India said that whatever the futureof the Indian constitutional question, it must be some years beforeIndian self-government could be an accomplished fact. In themeantime, it was essential that the efficiency of the Administrationshould be maintained. Besides the normal annual intake, it wouldbe necessary to recruit a substantial number of men at the end ofthe war to fill accumulated vacancies. His proposals had the supportof the Viceroy and of the Secretary of State&apos;s advisers. The schemesuggested by Lord Linlithgow for an Imperial Overseas service hadbeen considered, but the objections to it had been thought decisive.As regards the terms of service now proposed, the system of aprovident fund already existed in the Indian railways and workedwell. Its effect was to substitute a contributory provident fund forthe ordinary superannuation scheme. The objection to direct- recruitment on the old basis of full pension after 25 years&apos; servicewas clearly that an announcement in that sense would be taken tomean that we contemplated no change in the Indian constitutionalposition for that period.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that in the colonialservices, for what he might call the &quot;crash recruitment&quot; whichwould take place at the end of the war, he had in mind a five-yearrenewable contract, but for permanent recruitment, permanentservice terms would be offered. He felt very sceptical as to the termsproposed by the Secretary of State for India proving sufficientlyattractive. He had not been consulted about the suggestion for anImperial Service, but he would be most strongly opposed to theabsorption in the Colonies of senior men from India, because ofits effects on the prospects of the Colonial Service.The Secretary of State for War said that the virtual adminis-trative breakdown which had taken place in India during the warneeded serious consideration. As a matter of policy we ought, notmerely to continue at its present strength but materially to increasethe European element in the Indian Services; and to take whateversteps were necessary to achieve that result. If men of really goodquality were recruited, he did not feel that the Indian nationalistswould make trouble about their retention. He did not, however,believe that the terms proposed would attract the right type ofman. The possibility of interchangeability with the home serviceshould not be too lightly dismissed, though he was conscious of thedifficulties.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Treasury andthe Civil Service Commission had not been consulted about thepresent scheme, and suggested that they might be able to make acontribution of value. Recruitment for various forms of publicservice was carried out by the Commissioners and they would bevery glad to help with advice. He agreed that the question of adegree of interchangeability with the Home Service, possibly forshort periods and for secretariat work in India, meritedexamination.[27663-2] b 2
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs favoured1 furtherenquiry into the question of interchangeability with other Services,and shared the misgivings which had been expressed about the termsoffered.After further discussion the War Cabinet agreed : (1) That it was essential to maintain European recruitment forthe Indian Civil Service and the Indian Police at itspresent strength and quality, and that whatever stepswere necessary to secure this should be taken.(2) That the Secretary of State for India should be invited togive further consideration, in consultation with theTreasury and the Civil Service Commission, to the termsand the basis of recruitment to secure this end, a furtherreport being made to the War Cabinet in due course.Indian 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a joint MemorandumMinister at by the Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of State forWashington. Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 221). The Memorandum stated thatsince the end of 1941 an Agent-General of the Government of Indiahad been stationed at Washington. He was attached to the Embassywith the local rank of Minister. For a considerable time past theAgent-General had been encouraged by the Ambassador to handlea variety of political questions direct with the State Department.Lord Halifax now suggested that the Agency-General should bemade into an independent Mission headed by a Minister. The lateViceroy had been strongly opposed to this proposal on the broadground of principle, but the matter had been re-examined with thepresent Viceroy, and the Government of India now recommendedthat the proposed change should be made.The Secretary of State for India, while conscious of theobjections that could be urged and which were set out inW.P. (44) 221, thought that there would be great advantage in thechange which Lord Halifax had proposed, and which the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs was prepared to support.A general discussion followed in the course of which thefollowing points were made : -(a) There was grave danger, if an independent Indian Missionwere set up in Washington, of the United States Governmentpressing for diplomatic representation in India with results thatmight be very embarrassing.(b) To give an independent status as proposed to the IndianAgent-General might involve risks of the Agent-General or theGovernment of India pursuing a policy on certain matters whichdid not accord with that of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Theargument for the handling of matters of importance through Londonand the Foreign Office was a very strong one.(c) Much turned on the personality of the incumbent of thepost, and it was impossible to be certain that the right type of man,     ^with the right outlook, would necessarily be forthcoming.. (d) The type of problem that affected India in the United Stateswas not of sufficient magnitude or of a sufficient scale to renderspecial representation necessary, while there was nothing to showthat the change proposed was one to which first-class importance wasattached by public opinion in India.(e) It was urged, on the other hand, that there would beadvantage, given the probability of further constitutional develop-ment in India, in starting without delay to build up a nucleus oftrained Indian representatives in the foreign field, and that muchweight must attach to the view of the Government of India and ofthe Ambassador in Washington.
After further discussion The Secretary of State for ForeignA ffairs said that he was not himself enthusiastic about the proposal.As some difficulty was felt about it, he suggested that considerationof it should be postponed until Lord Halifax&apos;s next visit to thiscountry. If the Ambassador then produced really convincingreasons, the matter could again be brought before the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet Agreed with the course of action suggested by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs at &quot; X.&quot;Poland. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theDraft Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 285) proposingAgreement for that he should now be authorised to conclude a Military SuppliesMilitary Agreement with the &quot;Polish Government containing a mutual aidSupplies.        clause, on the same lines as the Agreement concluded with the(Previous       Czechoslovak Government in January 1943.  When this matter hadEef erence:      been previously considered by the War Cabinet it had been decidedW.M.(44)llth  to postpone signature because of the risk of misunderstanding byConclusions,     the U.S.S.R., whose relations with Poland were at that timeMinute 1.)      strained.  The signature of the Agreement would be of considerablepractical   convenience   to   ourselves;    the   Polish   Army   haddistinguished itself in Italy, and he did not, in present circum-stances, anticipate difficulty with the Soviet if the Agreement werenow concluded.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a sacrifice of a paperdebt of something over  120 million would be involved, and thatan announcement in the House of Commons would be essential. Heexpressed his readiness to make a statement on the matter, bringingout the arguments which weighed with us in making this sacrifice.In his view, we were morally committed to concluding theAgreement.The Secretary of State for War emphasised the arguments ofadministrative convenience in support of the conclusion of theAgreement.After further discussion the War Cabinet agreed (1) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should beauthorised to make the necessary arrangements for thesigning of this Agreement as soon as possible, and shouldinform the Soviet Embassy before signature.(2) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer should make astatement in the House of Commons explaining theconsiderations that had weighed with us in making thefinancial sacrifice involved.ElectoralReform.(PreviousEef erence:W.M.(44)56thConclusions,Minute 4.)   -4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 301)regarding the proposed Bill to amend the Parliamentary (Electionsand Meeting) Act, 1943.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security recalledthat at their meeting on the 24th April (W.M. (44) 56th Conclu-sions, Minute 4) the War Cabinet had approved in principle theintroduction of legislation to get over the difficulties which hadarisen in county areas in working the new registration machineryand had authorised him to discuss his proposals with representativesof the main political parties. At the meeting which he had heldwith these representatives and the party agents on the 10th Maysome of the Conservative Members of Parliament had expressedreluctance to abandon the requirement of two months&apos; residence.He had subsequently been informed that the representatives of theConservative party and of the National Liberal party were unable
to agree to the proposed Bill. The note which he had received fromthe Conservative representatives was appended to W.P. (44) 301.Their objections were founded on the fear that the principle of atleast two months&apos; residence might be permanently abolished andwere strengthened by the prospect that the Parliamentary Registerwould be used for Local Government elections. With a view toreassuring them he had proposed that the Bill should be framedon a temporary basis, and should provide that the Secretary of Statewould be required to make an Order fixing a date for the expirationof the amending legislation as soon as he was satisfied that theclerical difficulties could be met, and that in any case the legislationshould.come to an end on the 31st December, 1945, unless its lifewere extended by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament. Afterconsidering this proposal, the representatives of the Conservativeparty had said that it would not remove their objections and hadcontended that it should be possible to find some way of overcomingthe difficulties in obtaining the necessary clerical workers to operatethe existing registration machinery. In these circumstances, he hadhad further consultations both with the Electoral RegistrationOfficers and with the Ministry of Labour and National Service,from which it was clear that in the English county areas the choicelay between (i) finding some 1,600 additional workers, facing a longdelay and, when at last the appointed day was fixed, running asubstantial risk that there might be failures in some places and alarge number of errors in many places, and (ii) bringing inamending legislation despite the opposition of the Conservativerepresentatives.It was clear that the present situation was indefensibleand the position of the Government became more difficult withevery new by-election. Accordingly, he recommended that theGovernment should, proceed with the amending legislation. Itmight be possible to mitigate the opposition by promising that ifa General Election were held before the amending legislation hadexpired, the register would be frozen in such a way as in effect torequire two months&apos; residence. A promise might also be given thatif, as seemed likely, the proposal to use the Parliamentary Registerfor Local Government elections were adopted, the same procedurewould be applied when general Local Government elections wereheld.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The Secretary of State for War referred to the criticismswhich had been made in the House of Commons of the operationof the arrangements for registering Service personnel. It seemedlikely that when the Bill was introduced the critics would, put downamendments relating to these arrangements, unless the title of theBill was so drafted as to exclude such amendments.(b) The Paymaster-General asked whether it would not bepossible to meet the objections of the Conservative representativesty putting the qualifying date, say, two to four weeks earlier.(c) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that,before the Bill was introduced, he should have a meeting with theConservative representatives.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe would look into the points made by the Secretary of State forWar and the Paymaster-General.. He welcomed the suggestion that,before the introduction of the Bill, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should see the Conservative representatives.The War Cabinet-Agreed in principle that the proposed amending legislationshould be introduced, subject to further consideration bythe Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security of thepoints raised in discussion.
Subordinate 5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLegislation. Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 300) to(Previous which was appended a draft Motion for the appointment of aReference: Committee of the House of Commons for the purpose of scrutinisingW.M.(44)62nd subordinate legislation.Conclusions, The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security recalledMinute 3.)      that at their Meeting on the 5th May; the War Cabinet had agreed.that in the Debate on Mr. Molson&apos;s Motion he should intimate thatthe Government were prepared to set up a Committee of the. Houseof Commons for the purpose of scrutinising subordinate legislation.The Government&apos;s proposal had been well received in the debateand, since then, he had considered, along with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Law Officers, what form of Motion would beappropriate for setting up the proposed Committee. As a resultthe draft Motion appended, to W.P. (44) 300 had been prepared.It would be observed that the original terms of reference, set outin paragraph 10 of W.P. (44) 223, had been altered in certainrespects with a view to bringing out more clearly the objects forwhich the Committee would be appointed and the extent of itsresponsibilities. If the War Cabinet approved the terms of thedraft, he proposed to meet representative Members of Parliamentbefore the Motion was put down, in order to indicate to them inadvance the scope and nature of the Governments proposals.The following points arose in discussion : -(a) The question was raised whether it would not be desirableto have a Joint Committee of both Houses, or, at least, to providethat the House of Commons might meet jointly with any Committeewhich might be set up in the House of Lords. It was recalled at themeeting of the War Cabinet on the 5th May it had been felt thaton balance separate Committees would be preferable. Thefunctions of the Special Orders Committee of the House of Lordsdid not correspond exactly with those of the proposed House ofCommons Committee. The War Cabinet were informed that theHouse of Lords would probably desire to set up a Committee withcorresponding functions. If this were done, it might be that at alater date provision could be made for joint meetings, but for thepresent it seemed desirable not to tie the new Committee down toany joint arrangements until experience of. its working had beengained. It would, of course, be possible to arrange for the inter-change of information between the Committees in order to avoidany duplication in the submission of Memoranda to them and in thecalling of witnesses to appear before them.(6) It was explained that the proposed Committee would nothave power to consider the purely legal question whether or notsubordinate legislation was ultra vires or to pronounce on the meritsof the policy lying behind the subordinate legislation in question.It had not been felt desirable to lay this down explicitly in theMotion, but it would be made clear to the Committee.(c) Some doubt was expressed whether there were good groundsfor giving the Committee power to draw the attention of the Houseto any case in which there appeared to have been unjustifiabledelay in the publication of subordinate legislation. It was pointedout in reply that in the past Departments had not always takenprompt steps to publish orders and that delay in publicationweakened the safeguards against the oppressive use of the power ofsubordinate legislation.(d) It was suggested that the words &apos;&apos; upon which proceedingsmay be taken in either House in pursuance of any Act of Parlia-ment &quot; in the first paragraph of the Motion were obscure. TheHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security explained that ithad been difficult to devise a phrase which would cover all thevarious types of procedure, but undertook to look into the questionwhether the wording could be clarified.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Home Secretary and Minister of HomeSecurity should indicate to representative Members of
Parliament the scope and nature of the Governmentproposals and should thereafter arrange for the Motionto be put down at an early date.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary and Minister of HomeSecurity to make any minor amendments of the Motionwhich might appear to him desirable in the light of thediscussion with representative Members.of Parliament.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,Qth June, 1944.
