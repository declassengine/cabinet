ProposedInternationalMonetaryFund.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 49thConclusions.)1. The War Cabinet had a discussion&apos;as to what line shouldbe taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in replying to the -following Motion on Wednesday, the 10th May : &quot; That this Houseconsiders that the Statement of Principles contained in Cmd. 6519provides a suitable foundation for further international consulta-tion with a view to improved monetary co-operation after the war.&quot;After discussion, of which a full record is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions, the WarCabinet agreed as follows : -(1) The Government^ general attitude should be that theywelcomed the Debate as giving Parliament anopportunity of discussing the scheme and of expressingtheir views upon it, and thereby assisting in thecrystallisation of informed opinion, before furtherinternational discussions on the proposals took place.(2) The motion was in sufficiently general terms and could beaccepted; but the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inreplying to the Debate, would not commit His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to acceptance of the specific proposalscontained in the Statement.The War Cabinet also discussed the line which should be takenin regard to recent requests from the United States Governmentthat we should send representatives to a conference in Washingtonon the proposed International Monetary Fund. On this point theWar Cabinefs decision was as follows :  (3) Subject, of course, to the outcome of the discussions withthe Dominion Prime Ministers on this matter, and of theforthcoming Debate in Parliament, we should informthe United States Government that, while we were readyto send delegates to a conference about the scheme, wewere not at the present time in a position to sendrepresentatives with&apos; power to enter into commitmentson this matter on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Equal Pay. 2.   The War Cabinet considered what reply should be givento the following Parliamentary Question addressed to the PrimeMinister by Mrs. Cazalet Keir, M.P.    -&quot;To ask the Prime Minister, whether he is yet in aposition to make any statement on the question of equal payfor equal work.&quot;The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the reply should state that a Royal Commissionwould be set up to consider the question of equal pay;but that no indication should be given in the reply of themembership or the terms of reference of the RoyalCommission.(2) Took note of a suggestion that the terms of reference of theRoyal Commission should be so drafted as to require itto consider the effect of the grant of equal pay to womenon their prospects of employment after the war.Subordinate 3.   The War Cabinet considered what line should be taken onLegislation.     behalf of the Government in the reply: to the following Motion:  &quot; That this House would welcome the setting up of aSelect Committee, without,power to send for persons, papersand records, whose duty it should be to carry on a continuousexamination of all statutory rules and orders and otherinstruments of delegated legislation presented to Parliament,and to report from week to week whether, in the opinion of theCommittee, any such instrument is obscure or contains matterof a controversial nature or should for any reason be broughtto the special attention of the House.&quot;
4. The Lord President of the Council informed the WarCabinet that, during the discussion of these draft terms on theEuropean Advisory Commission, the Soviet Ambassador had putforward a proposal that, on the conclusion of hostilities, all theGerman armed forces should be declared prisoners of war. We hadseen objection to this course, mainly on the ground that, if such adeclaration was made, there was a risk that we should beundertaking obligations under the Geneva Convention which weshould not be able to carry out.As a result of further discussions the following revised, formulahad now been put forward : &apos;&apos; The personnel of all these formations and units shall, atthe discretion of the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forcesof the respective Allied State, be considered or declared to beThe Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to the proposals inhis memorandum (W.P. (44) 223) setting out the views of theMachinery of Government Committee on the Parliamentary scrutinyof subordinate legislation. The Committee suggested that, in orderto assist Members of Parliament in discharging their duty ofkeeping a watch on subordinate legislation, a ScrutinisingCommittee should be set up with the duty of reporting to Parliamenton whether any particular subordinate legislation had featureswhich made, it desirable that special attention should be drawn toits provisions. The proposed Committee could be set up by aSessional Order.The House of Lords already had a Special Orders Committee,which dealt ^with any instruments requiring an affirmativeresolution. This Committee had worked extremely well, and theMachinery of Government Committee had felt that it would be anadvantage if its traditions were carried into a Joint SelectCommittee covering both the House of Lords and the House ofCommons. If separate Committees were appointed there was adanger that they might arrive at different conclusions, and it hadto be borne in mind that there was no procedure under which theHouse of Lords could be compelled to assent to an instrument ofsubordinate legislation merely because it had been approved by theHouse of Commons?In discussion, the view was expressed that the House ofCommons were likely to be unwilling to agree to a Joint Committee.Moreover, should a deadlock arise through the existence of separateCommittees, there would be no insuperable difficulty in altering thearrangement.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthere was a class of Orders which were laid before Parliament butwhich were not subject to the procedure of affirmative or negativeresolutions. These Orders were made under Statutes, some of whichhad been enacted as long ago as 1875. The Minister of Health, whowas concerned in this matter, thought that it was undesirable tobring such Orders within the scope of the new scrutiny procedurenow proposed.This was agreed to.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityto reply to the debate on the Motion.(2) Agreed that the Home Secretary and Minister of HomeSecurity   should   state   that   the   Government   wereerepared to set up a Committee of the House ofommons on the lines indicated in W.P. (44) 223,&quot; butthat this Committee should be separate from the SpecialOrders Committee of the House of Lords, whose scopeand functions might require to be extended to correspondwith those of the proposed House of CommonsCommittee._ *?
prisoners of war, pending further decisions, and shall besubject to such conditions and directions as may be prescribedby the representatives of the Supreme Command of the Allies.&quot;This formula had, been considered on the previous day by theArmistice and Post-War Committee, Who had recommended itsacceptance.The War Cabinet-Endorsed this view and agreed that instructions in thissense should be conveyed to our representative on theEuropean Advisory Commission.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,5th May, 1944.
