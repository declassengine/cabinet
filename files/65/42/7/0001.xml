The War Cabinet had before them the following memoranda : (i) By the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(W.P. (44) 192), covering the agreed summary ofdiscussions with the representatives of the Dominionsand India.(ii) By the Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (44) 198),setting out his views on the proposed InternationalMonetary Eund, and dealing with the procedure inconnexion with the proposed publication of theStatement of Principles for the Fund,(iii) By the President of the Board of Trade (W.P. (44) 199),summarising the proposals for commercial policy as theystood after the recent conference with officials from theDominions and India.An account of the discussion, which turned mainly on thepublication of the Statement of Principles of the InternationalMonetary Fund, is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File ofWar Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : International Monetary Fund.(1) It was agreed, in principle, that, subject to the settlementof outstanding points^ we should offer no objection tothe publication at a very early date of the Statementof Principles for an International Monetary Fund,which had resulted from the technical discussions, on anon-committal basis, between the officials of HisMajesty&apos;s Treasury and the United States Treasury.(2) When the Statement of Principles was published, it shouldbe accompanied by a further statement which wouldmake it clear that, while His Majesty&apos;s Governmentregarded the scheme as a valuable contribution to ourobjectives in the field of international trade, HisMajesty&apos;s Government were in no way committed to, it;and that they wished the scheme to be the subject ofinformed discussion in Parliament and elsewhere beforeany commitment was undertaken.(3) It would be necessary to arrive at an understanding withthe United States Government as to the general line ofthe statements to be made by both Governments when thescheme was published. In particular, it would benecessary to make quite certain what was the attitudeof the United States Government in this matter. Wouldtheir attitude be non-committal; or were they in theposition of sponsoring the scheme, and inviting otherNations to adhere to it ?(4) The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to submit tothe Prime Minister a draft telegram to the United StatesGovernment informing them of the general lines of thestatement which we suggested should be made (seeConclusion (3)), and enquiring as to the United StatesGovernment^ attitude towards the scheme.(5) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs undertook toinform the Dominion Prime Ministers of the reasonswhy it had been necessary to agree to publication of theStatement of Principles for the International MonetaryFund at this juncture, a,nd also of our general attitudein regard to the scheme.Commercial Policy.(6) The time was not yet ripe for publication of the proposedscheme for the commercial union. In the first place thediscussions in regard to it were not so far advanced asDiscussionsunderArticle YII.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 24thConclusions,Minute 3.)
were those on monetary matters. In the second place,it was desirable that there should be discussion with theDominion Prime Ministers before publication.(7) The President of the Board of Trade undertook to submitto the War Cabinet a memorandum setting out the mainpoints for decision in regard to the proposed commercialunion, as a basis for discussion by the War Cabinet priorto the meeting with the Dominion Prime Ministers.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.A,Uth April, 1944
