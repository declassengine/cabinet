The War Cabinet considered what action should be takenInformation.    with regard to the publication in a newspaper of confidentialinformation relating to the proceedings of the European AdvisoryCommission.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe Minister of Information to i see the editor of thenewspaper and request him to disclose voluntarily thesource of his information, explaining to him that theGovernment took a very grave view of the disclosure andwere.prepared, if necessary, to use all the powers at theirdisposal in order to obtain the facts.A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;s. Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Restrictionson PassengerTravel.3. The War Cabinet had before them a note by the LordPresident of the Council (W.P. (44) 249) dealing with a suggestionmade at a meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee on the8th May (L.P. (44) 24th Meeting) that steps might be taken by theGovernment to discourage the holding of conferences involvingtravel by considerable numbers of persons.The Lord President of the Council explained that, at theirmeeting on the 8th May, the Lord Presidents Committee hadagreed that concession travel by wives and dependants of Servicepersonnel should be rationed, that severe cuts should be made inmain line services and that the Minister of War Transport shouldmake a statement designed to discourage the public from travelling.The Committee had felt that, when these steps were being taken, itwas inconsistent that conferences involving travel by a considerablenumber of persons should continue to be held.No special travel facilities were provided for conferences andthe direct relief to passenger services which their cancellation wouldafford was relatively small. It would not be possible to prohibitthe holding of conferences by the exercise of powers under theDefence Regulations, and reliance would have to be placed on anappeal to promoters not to hold them.Special enquiry had been made into the significance which theenemy would attach to the cancellation of conferences, from thepoint of view of security.The Minister of War Transport explained that ho publicity wasbeing given to the rationing of concession leave or to the cuts inmain line passenger services, and that it was intended that therailway companies should merely publish a general notice indicatingthat services would be restricted throughout the summer.In discussion it was pointed out that if the various conferenceswhich had been planned for this summer were cancelled, it would&apos; be extremely difficult to prevent the fact becoming publicly known.The general feeling of the War Cabinet, however, was that if therequest to promoters of conferences to cancel them were linked withthe increasing restrictions on passenger travel which were beingimposed, it was unlikely that the enemy would derive any valuableinformation from the action taken.
4. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (44) 243) dealing with a proposalthat, in order to encourage recruitment into the South African NavalForces, South Africa should be offered a gift of two or three corvettesor frigates.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had had it inmind to suggest to the Union Government that recruitment to theSouth African Naval Forces should be increased with a view totheir taking over entirely a number of escort vessels operating inthe South Atlantic and Indian Ocean. When he had consulted theHigh Commissioner in the Union and the Commander-in-Chief,South Atlantic, about the proposal, they had made it clear that anyapproach to the Union Government was likely to be more successfulif it was accompanied by an offer of two or three vessels as a gift.The offer would, he hoped, encourage South Africa to build up herown naval force and to undertake responsibility for trade defencein South African waters, and it would be made clear that it didnot commit us to giving further ships to the Union Governmentfree of cost. The Treasury had agreed to the proposaland, if the War Cabinet approved, he proposed to approachField-Marshal Smuts on the subject during his visit to this country.. The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal in W.P. (44) 243 that, in order toencourage recruitment to South African Naval Forces, theUnion Government should be offered tAvo or three corvettesor frigates as a gift from the United Kingdom Govern-ment. v *Gift ofWarships toSouth Africa.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,11th May, 1944.The following question was raised in discussion : *Would it not be desirable to restrict until further notice theexport of national newspapers, in view of the risk that theymight convey information to the enemy regarding forthcomingoperations ?-     The War Cabinet-. (1) Agreed in principle that steps should be taken to canceluntil further notice all conferences which involved travelby considerable numbers of persons.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council, the Minister ofWar Transport and the Minister of Information toconsider what procedure should be followed in carryingout the decision recorded in (1).(3) Invited the same group of Ministers to consider alsowhether any restrictions should be imposed on the exportof national newspapers.
