Proposed 1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theDeclaration to United States Government had communicated to us the text of aAxis Satellites, proposed Declaration to the Axis satellites, to be made on behalf ofthe United States Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government and theSoviet Government.- The United States Government were nowanxious to publish this Declaration at 5 p.m. that afternoon. It wasunderstood that the Soviet Government had agreed to this course.The text of the proposed Declaration was handed round at themeeting.The general view of the War Cabinet was that, while it wasunlikely that a declaration of this kind would be of materialadvantage, there was no reason to object to the course proposed,provided that the declaration was drawn in suitable terms. Certainpassages in the present draft were, however, not happily worded.In particular, attention was drawn to the third clause, which readas follows : &quot; The prospects of these countries for future existence asindependent States, the right freely to choose their own govern-ments, the preservation of their rightful territories, and theavoidance of military devastation cannot be enhanced but onlydiminished by their continued collaboration with NaziGermany.&apos;&apos;The implications of this clause as drafted were unfortunate,and the wording ought to be amended before we concurred in theissue of the proposed Declaration.The War Cabinet accordingly agreed : That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shouldinform the United States Government that we wished toput forward certain amendments (directed more to thewording than to the substance of the Declaration) before wecould concur in its issue. We therefore asked that the issueof the Declaration might be postponed for a short interval.Bombing Policy. 2. The War Cabinet had a discussion on Bombing Policy(Previous       against targets in enemy-occupied territories.Reference: record of the discussion and the conclusions reached is con-W.M.(44)43rd tained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Conclusions,Minute 3.)Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
