Despite rather unfavourable weather, the Allied AirForces had been able (a) to maintain air superiority and prevent interference fromthe German Air Force;(b) to deliver the airborne force in the battle area; and(c) to neutralise enemy coastal batteries and Radar installa-tions.Since the first assault our short-range fighters had been mainlyused to support the battle, and our bombers to attack road andrailway communications well behind the battle area. Five landingstrips were now in use in France.Enemy losses claimed for the previous seven days had been289 aircraft destroyed;, our losses amounted to 480 aircraft (245British and 235 United States).In the Mediterranean theatre 16,300 sorties had been flown asagainst 1,100 by the enemy, all of these latter being in defence ofSouthern Germany and the Balkans. Enemy losses had been89 aircraft as against 122 Allied losses.The total sinkings by enemy action during May now amountedto 27,297 tons. During the previous week confirmed losses due toenemy action, including &quot; Overlord &quot; losses, amounted to 15,272 tons.The Allied naval losses in &quot; Overlord&quot; had been much less thananticipated, and amounted to 4 destroyers, 1 frigate, 2 mine-sweepers, 1 Headquarters Ship, 4 L.S.T. and 3 Coastal Force craft.The build-up on the beaches was proceeding satisfactorily.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff described theOperations in North-West France. The United States Forces onthe east side of the Cherbourg Peninsula were outflanking Monte-bourg and had captured Carentan. Further to the east, theAmericans were now advancing south of Colombieres; and hadcaptured the Forest of Cerisy. The British, in the neighbourhood ofBayeux, had reached Hottot and Tilly-sur-Seulles. Canadiansadvancing on Caen had met considerable opposition in the earlystages of the battle, but were now astride the Caen-Bayeux road.The Germans were putting in strong counter-attacks north and westof Caen and it was unlikely that we should endeavour to try to takethe town by frontal assault. The build-up on the beach-heads wasnow only very little behind schedule. 9,000 prisoners had so far beentaken.In Italy there had been virtually no enemy opposition on the leftand right flanks, although in the centre, resistance had increased asour forces moved forward into the mountains. There were indica-tions that the enemy might attempt to hold up the advance of the5th Army round Grosseto. 25,000 prisoners had been taken sincethe 11th May.In the attack in the Karelian Isthmus the Russians claimed tohave advanced 15 miles on a front of 25 miles.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Russia.Loan ofBritishWarships.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 60thConclusions,Minute 2.)[27663-2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heunderstood that the Russian Admiral who had been sent to thiscountry to take over the warships which we had lent to Russia hadadopted a very difficult attitude.The First Lord of the A dmiralty confirmed that this was so, andundertook to consider and report to the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs whether the matter ought to be taken up officiallywith the Russian Government.-3]b 2
Foreign Affairs.France.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 73rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Recognition ofFrench NationalCommittee asa ProvisionalGovernment.Italy.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)51stConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that there had been no material progress in the discus-sions about the control of civil affairs in France. General de Gaullehad not been prepared to invite Commissioners from Algiers to cometo this country for talks in the absence of American participation.He had suggested that conversations should take place withM. Vienot. It was perhaps for consideration whether we shouldnot try to work out something on the official level with M. Vienotwhich could afterwards be shown to the United States. But conver-.sations on this level did not seem likely to improve the position,vis-a-vis the United States Government. He proposed to consultthe Prime Minister as to the next step.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that theBelgian Prime Minister had asked him for advice as to the line tobe taken on a note from the French National Committee to thevarious Allies, indicating that they had constituted themselves aprovisional Government of France. Similar soundings had beentaken by the Dutch and the Poles. The French communication hadnot in fact asked for recognition and he (the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs) was endeavouring to persuade those of our Allieswho had consulted him to content themselves with taking note of it,and adding that the relations they had previously had with theFrench Committee of National Liberation they Avould now have withthe new body. Russia was still, so far as he was aware, like theUnited States and ourselves, reluctant to recognise the FrenchNational Committee as a provisional Government.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the WarCabinet that the establishment of a new Government under SignorBonomi had been entirely unexpected. The Allied Governmentshad never contemplated any change at this stage. The intentionhad been that the Italian leaders after a short visit to Rome shouldreturn to Naples. Our position was weak inasmuch as they hadnot in terms been informed that they must consult us before takingany action in this matter. Furthermore, General Mason Macfarlanehad acquiesced in the action taken. It was important now to ensurethat the new Government accepted the obligations which had beenaccepted by General Badoglio. The whole matter was likely to bediscussed in the Advisory Council for Italy on the following day.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Protection ofJews in Terri-tory underGermanOccupation.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that the Chief Rabbi had written to the Prime Ministerto suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government should declare all Jewsin enemy territory to be British-protected persons. The difficultiesin accepting any such proposal were, in the judgment of the ForeignOffice, insuperable. Nor was there any reason to think that itsacceptance would in any way improve the position of the Jews. ThePrime Minister had been anxious, however, that the War Cabinetshould be aware of the position before a negative reply was sentto the Chief Rabbi.The War Cabinet-Agreed that a negative reply should be sent to the ChiefRabbi; and asked that a copy of the correspondence shouldthereafter be circulated for their information.)
Apsley House. 5.   The War Cabinet had before them-    &apos;(i) a Memorandum by  the Chancellor of the  Exchequer(W.P. (44)302); and(ii) a   Memorandum   by   the   Minister   of   Information(W.P. (44) 308)regarding the offer by the Duke of Wellington to the Government ofpart of Apsley House and the Wellington heirlooms.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the Duke ofWellington had offered to place at the disposal of the Governmenta substantial part of the accommodation in Apsley House togetherwith a selection of the pictures, plate and relics originally theproperty of the First Duke. The premises were vested in a body ofTrustees, including the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the Houseof Commons and himself (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), and theproposal had not yet been considered by the Trustees as such.The Directors of the National Gallery, the Victoria and AlbertMuseum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Wallace Collectionhad been consulted informally and strongly recommended the accep-tance of the Duke&apos;s offer. It was estimated that the value of theproperty offered was at least one million pounds, a large part ofwhich represented the value of the pictures. The offer was con-ditional on the family&apos;s retaining for its use, free of rent andrates, part of the basement, part of the ground floor and the secondand third floors of Apsley House. The rental value of the spacein Apsley House to be retained by the family was estimated at 1,250, the rates on which would be about  550. If the offer wereaccepted, about  25,000 would have to be spent on redecorating,repairs and modern heating, lighting and sanitary installations;while the annual expenditure in maintaining the building providingfor the custody of the exhibits would be of the order of  6,000 a yearHe had agreed with the Minister of Works that the offer was onethat should be accepted, subject to the approval of the Trusteesand to certain arrangements on points of detail, and he sought theconcurrence of the War Cabinet before proceeding further.The Minister of Information doubted whether the offer was onethat the Government should accept. He was not satisfied that theexpenditure of  25,000 in repairing and redecorating Apsley House, 6,000 a year on the maintenance of the building and of thecustody of the exhibits and the amount involved in relieving theDuke of rates and taxes, would be justified by the return. Theacceptance of the offer might create an awkward precedent and therewere other houses (e.g., Bridgewater House) where a bargain of thekind proposed would be of greater advantage. He also doubtedwhether it was wise to add another to the many scattered museumsin London and suggested that it would be preferable if some arrange-ment could be made to exhibit at the National Gallery the morevaluable pictures included in the Duke&apos;s collection. He agreedwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer that a better setting wasdesirable for Government receptions but urged that instead ofusing Apsley House for this purpose, the Government should restorethe Banqueting Hall of the Palace of Whitehall.The following points arose in discussion -(a) It was pointed out that the offer made by the Duke includedpictures of very great value. If the offer were notaccepted the Duke might be driven to propose the sale ofsome of the pictures and it would be difficult, if notimpossible, for the Trustees to refuse their consent.(b) The proposal to use the Banqueting Hall for Governmenthospitality would involve finding other accommodationfor the Royal United Services Institution. The cost ofdisplacing the Institution might amount to as much as 300,000. The suggestion was made that it might bepossible to arrange to transfer the Royal United ServicesInstitution to Apsley House, thus leaving the BanquetingHall available for the purposes of Governmenthospitality.
There was general agreement that the question whether theDuke&apos;s offer should be accepted should be decided without referenceto the question whether some more suitable accommodation thanLancaster House ought to be made available for Government hospi-tality, or whether Apsley House could be used for this purpose.It was also generally felt that, more particularly in view of thevalue of the pictures, the Duke&apos;s offer was generous and merited veryserious consideration. The offer would, however, be more acceptableif the Duke were prepared to put some limit on the period for whichthe family would retain the use of part of the premises, free of rentand rates. It might also be of advantage if some arrangement couldbe made whereby the pictures might be available for loan to publicgalleries.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Works to express to the Duke ofWellington the Government^ appreciation of his offer,and to discuss the matter with him further with a view toascertaining whether, if it were accepted, he would bewilling to agree (i) to some limit on the period for whichthe family would retain the right to occupy part of thepremises, free of rent and rates, and (ii) to an arrange-ment under which the pictures would be available for loanto public galleries. The Minister of Works might alsofind out whether the Duke would be prepared to consider aproposal to transfer the Royal United Services Institutionfrom the Banqueting Hall to Apsley House.The Horse-RacingProgramme.(PreviousReference:W.M. (42)26thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 312) onthe question whether, in view of recent restrictions on rail transport,any further curtailment of horse-racing was called for.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe had discussed the matter with the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries who agreed with his view that on balance the case forfurther restrictions was not strong.The Secretary of State for War said that he found difficulty inreconciling the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal with the decision toration concession travel by wives and dependants of Servicepersonnel.The Minister of War Transport said that no extra trains werenow run on account of races, and while races resulted in someadditional inconvenience to other passengers, the stopping of racing-would not release any trains or rolling stock for other purposes.The War Cabinet-Expressed general concurrence with the views set out inthe Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security.Parliament.Debate on theWhite Paperon EmploymentPolicy.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)67thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The War Cabinet was informed that it was proposed thatthe following Motion should be put down on the occasion of thisdebate  &quot; That this House welcomes the intention of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, declared in the White Paper onEmployment Policy, to accept as one of their primary aimsand responsibilities the maintenance of a high and stablelevel of employment after the war; and endorses the broadlines of policy set out in the White Paper.&quot;
The War Cabinet-(1) approved the terms of the proposed Motion;(2) agreed that the debate should take place in the followingweek;(3) expressed the hope that it would not be found necessary toallow more than two days for the debate, but agreedthat if a third day should prove necessary, this could onlybe made available by taking a supply day;(4) agreed that the Government speakers in the debate should besettled at the meeting of the War Cabinet on the follow-ing day.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,12th June, 1944.
