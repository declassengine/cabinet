&quot; Overlord &quot; 1.   The War Cabinet had before them-a note by the Minister of Production (W.P. (44) 350)covering a report by Sir Findlater Stewart proposingthat in the coastal belt from Southampton to the Washand in the Firth of Forth area the visitors&apos; ban shouldremain in force for a further period after the end ofJune; anda memorandum by the Minister of Production (W.P. (44)349) covering a report by Sir Findlater Stewart showingthe results of his discussions with Departments on thequestion of the withdrawal of &apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos; Security        ^measures.Sir Findlater Stewart&apos;s reports had been prepared in pursuanceof the conclusions reached by the War Cabinet at their meeting onthe 13th June (W.M. (44) 77th Conclusions, Minute 2), when theyhad agreed in principle that the special &apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos; securityrestrictions, including the visitors&apos; ban and the Irish travel ban,should be removed at the end of June, subject to the retention of anyarticular restriction if good cause were shown, and had invitedir Findlater Stewart to work out the detailed arrangements with,the Departments concerned.The War Cabinet were informed that the Supreme Commanderattached very great importance to the retention of the visitors&apos; banin the areas in question, but he was prepared to agree that the banshould be removed in the coastal belt west of Southampton. Broadly,the result of this would be that after the end of June there would beno restrictions on visits to Dorset, Devon and Cornwall. TheMinistry of War Transport did not oppose the removal of the banon transport grounds, but it was not their intention to runadditional passenger trains if the ban was removed, and this wouldhave to be made clear in the announcement about the removal of theban which it would be necessary to make.Certain of the other measures (e.g., the arrangements forpreventing direct sailings between Eire and the Iberian Peninsula)would have to be retained for a period after the end of June, andcertain measures which had been taken to improve the normalsecurity arrangements of Government Departments in war timewould, of course, remain. It was proposed, however, that the restof the restrictions would be removed at the end of June, and in oneor two cases, where action for the removal of the restriction couldbe taken secretly, the process had already begun.There was general agreement that the overriding considerationshould be that nothing should be done which would prejudice theSupreme Commander&apos;s plans. On this ground some objection wasseen to proposals for relaxations of various restrictions whichinvolved public announcements.With regard to the visitors&apos; ban, it was pointed out that theremoval of restrictions from Dorset, Devon and Cornwall would beparticularly welcome at the present time in view of the flying bombattacks on London. On the other hand, there appeared to be nopossibility of removing the ban from those without making apublic announcement, which might be prejudicial to the SupremeCommander&apos;s plans. It was suggested, therefore, that the bettercourse might be to retain the ban for the whole area, coupled withsome administrative relaxation which would . enable personsevacuated from London to enter the areas concerned. 1]Most of the other restrictions could be removed without anypublic announcement or were of such relatively minor importancethat the announcements of their removal, if suitably staggered, werenot likely to compromise S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s plans. The removal of theIrish travel ban, however, gave rise to some difficulty. On the onehand, it was pointed out that, in view of the feelings of NorthernIreland, the need to give some explanation to the Eire Governmentand the general desirability of giving the public fair warning ofthe restrictions, it would be impossible to dispense with an announce-ment.   On the other hand, it was urged that it might well be(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)77thConclusions,Minute 2.)(a)Of)

The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidAttacks by      that at the Civil Defence Committee earlier in the day he hadMying Bombs, reviewed the situation with regard to attacks by flying bombs and(Previous       that he desired to bring two points to the notice of the WarReference:       Cabinet: First, the available building labour force in London wasW.M.

Departments concerned would report on this problem as a matterof extreme urgency, and he might have to bring the matter beforethe War Cabinet next week.   Secondly, he felt that, in the interestsof the maintenance of morale, the time had probably come to makesome public announcement about the attacks on London.    Heproposed to circulate a memorandum on this point for considerationat the Meeting of the War Cabinet on the 3rd July.In discussion, it was emphasised that, given the limitations onthe available labour, the Ministry of Works emergency repairorganisation had done extremely good work. No difficulties wereexpected in providing all the glass and glass substitute needed forthe repair of windows, and it was hoped to obtain slaters and tilersfrom the Army in order to expedite the repair of roofs. Theimportance of rendering damaged houses wind- and water-tight atthe earliest possible moment was stressed.Reference was also made to the magnificent work done by theCivil Defence Services.The Prime Minister said that he had it in mind to make astatement in the House on Tuesday which would indicate that,although London had been the main target, the people were meetingthe attacks with a determination not to be deterred from theirnormal life and work, and were glad to think that they were sharingin the battle -in some measure, however small, and so diverting someof the enemy&apos;s resources from our advancing Armies. He wouldpay tributes to the work of the Civil Defence Services and theemergency repair squads and would see that some reference wasmade to the fact that a good deal of the weight of the attacks fellon the counties south of London.The War Cabinet-^Took note of these statements.possible to couple the retention of the ban in form with suchadministrative relaxations as would do away with its main dis-advantages. The transport available would, in any event, preventfor some time a complete resumption of travel between Great Britainand Ireland.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that Sir Findlater Stewart, after consultation withthe Departments concerned, should report further on theproposals for the withdrawal of &quot; Overlord &quot; securitymeasures in the reports annexed to W.P. (44) 349 andW.P. (44) 350 in the light of the discussion. Inparticular, attention should be directed to the possi-bility of devising administrative relaxations whichwould remove the need for any public announcementwith regard to the visitors&apos; ban or the Irish travel ban.(2) Approved the withdrawal from the 1st July of anymeasures which could be withdrawn without publicannouncement or other overt action likely to prejudicethe Supreme Commander&apos;s plans.
3. The War Cabinet were informed that a suggestion had beenmade that some of the Crimean war trophies, including, inparticular, the Great Bell of Sevastopol and other trophies in theUnited Services Museum, should be returned to Russia. There wasreason to believe that this gesture would be greatly welcomed in thatcountry. Certain persons of academic distinction had intended toembody this suggestion in a letter to The Times, but before doing sohad enquired whether it would be likely to be agreeable to theauthorities.The Prime Minister expressed his doubts as to the wisdom ofthis suggestion, and after a short discussion the War Cabinet agreedthat it should be discouraged.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,29* A June, 1944.Crimean WarTrophies.SuggestedReturn toRussia.
