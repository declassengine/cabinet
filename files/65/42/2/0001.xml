THE War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland(W.P. (44) 174) covering-(a) A draft of a White Paper containing proposals for aNational Water Policy and for the constitution of RiverBoards; and(b) A draft Rural Water Supplies-and Sewerage Bill.The Minister of Health explained that the drafts of the WhitePaper and the Bill had been approved by the Reconstruction HCommittee. The White Paper presented the Governments generalproposals with a view to discussion in Parliament and with thevarious interests concerned. The Bill made provision for theimprovement of rural water supplies and sewerage with the aidof Exchequer grants, which would amount to a total of  15 millionin England and Wales and  6,375,000 in Scotland. Better ruralwater supplies would not only enable housing conditions to beimproved, but would also be of substantial help to the agriculturalindustry.If the War Cabinet approved, the White Paper would bepublished after Easter and the Bill would then be introduced witha view to its being passed by the Summer Recess.The. Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in generalagreement with the proposals of the Health Ministers and wassatisfied that the expenditure proposed in the Bill was necessary.It was clear, however, that the competing claims for labour andmaterials would make it impossible for much work to be done underthe Bill for some considerable time, and for this reason he suggestedthat in Chapter 7 of the White Paper it was unwise to lay so muchstress on the urgency of improving rural water supplies.Arising out of the financial provisions of the Bill, a generaldiscussion ensued as to the very large sums involved, not only in thevarious post-war reconstruction projects, but also in other fields inwhich there had been pressure in Parliament for immediateincreases in expenditure. Thus the demand for equal pay forwomen, if conceded, would lead to an annual increase of  22 millionin the Exchequer charge for teachers and the Civil Service; whileto meet in full the suggestions made by Members of Parliament forimproved pay and allowances for the Services would involve anannual increase of more than  200 million. It was suggested thatthe Budget debates would provide an opportunity to bring home toParliament and the country a comprehensive picture of the commit-ments which the Government had already entered into in connectionwith post-war reconstruction, and of the amount of additionalexpenditure which would be involved in other reconstruction plans,which had not yet been brought before Parliament.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that, if itwere decided to set up Standing Committees after Whitsuntide, theRural Water Supplies and Sewerage Bill might suitably go to aStanding Committee.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the publication of the White Paper, subject tothe revision of Chapter 7 with a view to removing fromit the suggestion that a large amount of work could be *vJ-undertaken immediately. The Minister of Healthundertook to send to the Prime Minister a copy of thedraft White Paper, showing the amendments proposed.(2) Agreed that when the White Paper had been presented to*&quot; Parliament, the Rural Water Supplies and SewerageBill should be introduced on the understanding that, ifit were decided to set up Standing Committees, the Billmight be referred to a Standing Committee.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,4th April, 1944.
