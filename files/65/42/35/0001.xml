103W.M. 77 (m).&quot; Overlord &quot;Security.Oensorhip ofDiplomaticCommuniea-tions from thisCountry.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 70thConclusions,Minute 6.)&quot; Overlord &quot;Security.Duration ofGeneralRestrictions.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)70thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The War Cabinet discussed a proposal that the diplomaticban should be lifted, not at D + 7 as the War Cabinet had agreedat their meeting on 31st May, but at D -i-15.The discussion and conclusions are recorded in the Secretary&apos;sStandard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.&apos;-.   2.   The War Cabinet had before them : (i) a note by the Minister of Production (W.P. (44) 307)covering a report by Sir Findlater Stewart in which, it was suggested that, on the assumption that the diplo-matic ban would be lifted at D + 7, there should be areview of the remaining restrictions at D +12 in thelight of S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s requirements as then known, thegoverning principle being a return, as soon as possible,to the security arrangements previously enforced; and(ii) a note by the&apos; Minister of Production (W.P. (44) 319)covering a further report by Sir Findlater Stewartproposing, on the assumption that the diplomatic banwas continued until D +15, that the bulk of the otherrestrictions, including the visitors&apos; bans, should be liftedat D + 25.It was explained that since these notes had been circulatedS.H.A.E.F. had asked that no decision should be taken to lift thevisitors&apos; ban until further experience had shown whether, in viewof the demands on transport and accommodation in the area con-cerned arising from the operation in progress, the removal of theban could be accepted.Discussion centred first on the question of the visitors&apos; ban.In favour of the retention of the ban, it was pointed out that therequirements of operations were imposing a very heavy strain oninland transport, particularly in the area covered by the ban. Themilitary traffic would reach its peak at the end of June and wouldstay at a high level until the middle of August. It would be quiteimpossible to put on any additional trains for civilian passengersand if the ban were to be removed this would have to be made clear.On the whole the public had accepted the visitors&apos; ban well andit had undoubtedly eased congestion in the operational areas.Against the retention of the ban, it was urged that it imposedconsiderable hardship and that there appeared to be little to besaid for retaining it on security grounds once the diplomatic banhad been lifted. Doubts were also expressed whether, if no addi-tional transport into the area were provided, there would be anyreal danger of interference by the public with the transit of troopsand supplies through the area.The War Cabinet then discussed the question of the removalof the ban on travel to Ireland.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe hoped that the ban on travel to Northern Ireland would not becontinued for longer than the bulk of the restrictions. The banhad been accepted loyally by the people of Northern Ireland butthey would be likely to resent any continuation of the ban oncethe main body of restrictions had been removed. The Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs urged that the ban on travel to SouthernIreland should also be removed along with the bulk of the restric-tions. The Minister of Labour and National Service stressed theimportance of resuming the importation of labour from SouthernIreland.[27663-5]
It was pointed out that it would be possible to remove therestrictions on travel between the United Kingdom and Ireland,while retaining the restrictions on the movement of shipping fromIreland to Continental ports.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that on operationalgrounds it might be necessary to retain beyond D + 25 the ban onfishing in certain areas.After further discussion, the War Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the restrictions, including thevisitors&apos; ban and the Irish travel ban, should be removedat the end of June, subject to the retention of any par-ticular restrictions if good cause was shown. In thisconnection particular attention should be paid to themovement of shipping, between Irish and Continentalports.(2) Invited Sir Eindlater Stewart to work out the detailedarrangements with the Departments concerned.Germany.DraftInstrumentof Surrender.(Previousreference:W.M.(44)62ndConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (44) 315) to which was:attacheda draft instrument of surrender for Germany, prepared as a resultof a series of informal meetings held by the three representatives onthe European Advisory Commission.The draft had been examined by the Armistice and Post-WarCommittee, who commended it to the War Cabinet and suggestedthat the United Kingdom representative-On the European AdvisoryCommission should be told that the draft was generally acceptable.The War Cabinet-Endorsed this recommendation.Ceylon. 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the(Previous Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (44) 299) about the CeylonReference:       Constitution.W.M. (43)74th        A year ago a declaration had been made by His Majesty&apos;sConclusions,     Government  that the  Ceylon  Constitution  should   be  furtherMinute 2.)      examined by means of a commission or conference; that this couldnot be arranged in war conditions, but would be taken up with theleast possible delay after the war.In view of the difficult situation which had arisen, the Secre-tary of State for the Colonies now recommended that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should decide that a commission should be appointedto proceed with the examination of the Ministers&apos; constitutionalproposals, visiting Ceylon for this purpose about the end of thisyear; and that the life of the present State Council should be pro-longed by the necessary amendment of the Order in Council for afurther term Of two years, as recommended by the Governor andAdmiral Layton.The Secretary of State for India urged that the announcementof the appointment of the Commission should include a statementthat facilities would be accorded to the Indian and other minoritiesin Ceylon to express their point of view before the Commission.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet-Approved this course, subject to the understanding thatthe appointment of a commission didT not entail   forHis Majesty&apos;s Government any further commitment thanthat contained in the 1943 Declaration;     :
Air Raids.Attack byPilotlessAircraft(PreviousReference:5. The War Cabinet had before them a report by the Chiefof the Air Staff (W.P. (44) 320) on the attack by pilotless aircraftwhich had been made by the enemy on the previous night.   .The Chief of the Air Staff said that according to the latestinformation only 11,&apos; and not 27 pilotless aircraft, as stated inW.P. (44) 320, had been launched against this country.   The air-W.M. (43) 149th craf  did n0  appear to be controlled by wireless and their speed wasConclusions,     relatively low.Minute 1.)It was possible, however, that the enemy would be able to followup with a heavier attack and for this reason the Chiefs of Staffhad recommended that the supply sites should be heavily attacked,and also all the modified pilotless aircraft sites capable of operation,in so far as this was possible without prejudicing in any way theurgent needs of the Battle of France.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securitysaid thatthe reports of the damage done by the pilotless aircraft which hadlanded in London showed, that the effect was no greater than aparachute mine and was rather less than an up-to-date 2,000 lb.bomb. He would, however, be grateful if as much effort as couldbe spared from the battle fronts could be diverted to attacks on thepilotless aircraft sites and their supply sites. He had arrangedwith the Ministry of Information that the press should publish noinformation about the attack on the previous night.The question was discussed whether a statement on the subjectshould be made in the House of Commons on the following day. Thegeneral view of the War Cabinet was against making any suchstatement at present.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chief of the Air Staff to make a request to theSupreme Commander, in the name of the War Cabinet,on the lines proposed at &quot;X.&quot;(2) Agreed that no public statement should be made about thenew form of attack until the enemy made it public, oruntil the weight or extent of the attack made a statementdesirable.(3) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityand the Minister of Information to arrange that infuture information published about air raids in southernEngland (i.e., south of a line from the Wash to theBristol Channel), would give no indication where the airraid had taken place, beyond saying that it occurred insouthern England.Prance. g    The War Cabinet were given the latest particulars as to(Previous the position in regard to the special currency which had been issuedReference: by the Supreme Commander for the use of the Allied Forces inW.M.(44)76th  France.Conclusions, The War Cabinet were informed that a report had beenMinute 3.) received that some of the twenty French Liaison Officers who had goneto France with Operation &quot; Overlord&quot; had said that they wouldnot accept this supplementary currency, which they regardedas &quot;false money.&quot; General Koenig was said to-have expressedthe same view. There was some indication that General Eisen-hower was considering recalling the French Liaison Officers to thiscountry. There was also some reason to suppose that the United StatesGovernment were considerably perturbed at reports which theyhad received from the Supreme Commander, Allied ExpeditionaryForce, on this matter, and that President Roosevelt might make aunilateral statement at a press conference in the near future.Thus it was thought that he might say that the notes were all rightbecause they had the backing of General Eisenhower.
A suggestion had been made to the Foreign Secretary, withwhich he agreed, that it might be wise for the Prime Ministerto send a short telegram to the President that night, to the effectthat there were certain passages in his latest telegram about whichwe were rather uneasy, and that we were proposing to send himshortly our comments on the situation. A telegram on these linesmight hold the situation, and avert a statement by the President,which would make it harder for us to reach a satisfactory settle-ment of this position. It seemed all the more desirable to do thisbecause the Presidents latest telegram seemed to show that he wasnot fully seized of the whole position.A general discussion ensued, in the course of which, the PrimeMinister indicated that, having regard to the strong views whichthe President obviously held in this matter, he (the Prime Minister)was disinclined to telegraph to the President on the lines proposed.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,13th June, 1944.
