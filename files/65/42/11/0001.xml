2. Following on the discussion at their previous meeting, theWar Cabinet had before them the draft of a telegram to LordKillearn prepared by the Prime Minister (a copy of which isappended to these Minutes).The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a telegram from Cairoreporting that Lord Killearn had that day received representationsfrom the King that Nahas contemplated an attack upon him in themeeting of the Egyptian Parliament that evening. Enquiries hadproduced an emphatic negative from Nahas and a guarantee whichhad been communicated to the Palace.In reply to a question from the Prime Minister, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff said that the matter was a political oneand not, therefore, one on which the Commanders-in-Chief in theMiddle East should express a view. It would, however, be veryinconvenient if force had to be used. We did not want trouble inthe Middle East if it could be avoided.The Lord President of the Council felt that, if Nahas were tobe got rid of at this moment, the resulting discontent would be arunning sore. He thought that it would be better to face up to theissue now.After further discussion, the War Cabinet *Approved the draft telegram by the Prime Minister,subject to the substitution, in the first sentence of theMessage to King Farouk, of the word &apos;&apos; which &apos;&apos; for theword &quot;and,&quot; and the addition after the message of thefollowing sentence: &quot;If you think &apos; managing theElection&apos; too strong, you are at liberty to substitute&apos; preparing for the Election.&apos; &quot;3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (44) 212) covering a draftWhite Paper setting out proposed improvements in Service pay andallowances and in war pensions.The Lord President of the Council explained that, with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, he had undertaken informal discussions with Members ofParliament in accordance with the decision of the War Cabinetfollowing the Debate on the 2nd March. Thereafter the Chancellorof the Exchequer, in consultation with the Service Ministers, hadprepared proposals which had been approved by the LordPresidents Committee and were set out in the draft White Paper.The proposals were designed to deal only with the major pointsraised in the discussions and a number of minor points wouldremain to be examined by the Departments concerned. The primaryobject in view in preparing the proposals had been to improve thelot of officers and men in the lowest ranks who had families.[27370-4] b 2Finland.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)47thConclusions,Minute 2.) .Egypt.(PreviousEef erence:W.M.(44)52ndConclusions,Minute 1.)Service Pay andAllowances.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)30thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Permanent Undersecretary of State for ForeignAffairs informed the War Cabinet of the latest developments in thenegotiations between Finland and Russia. The Finnish reply hadnow been received and the Russian Government had enquiredwhether we had any observations to offer on the answer proposed tobe sent to it.The War Cabinet-Approved the terms of a reply proposed by the PrimeMinister.A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;sStandard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.
The main features of the scheme put forward in the WhitePaper were :  *(i) Increases in the daily rate of pay of non-tradesmenprivates, who formed the bulk of the fighting men in theArmy, with corresponding adjustments in the otherServices, at a cost of  12,000,000 a year,(ii) Where there was a child or children in the family, anincrease from 25s. to 35s. in the minimum payment madeto wives of men in the Services. Including certainadjustments in the allotment scales, this would cost 20,000,000 a year.(iii) Allowances for children of men in the Services at a flatrate of 12s. Qd. a week instead of on a scale descendingfrom 9s. Qd.   This would cost  18,000,000 a year.(iv) Increases in the allowances for wives and children ofmarried officers with families and the extension of ante-natal allowances to officers, at a cost of  2,000,000 a year,(v) An increase from 18s. per unit to 22s. per unit iii theminimum standard for the families of men in theServices. This proposal would not involve anyadditional cost, but would reduce to &quot; 5,000,000 thesaving which would otherwise result from the increasesin pay and allowances,(vi) An increase in the minimum war pension for a widowwith children (or over 40 or incapacitated) from 26s. 8d.a week to 32s. Qd. a week, together with certain increasesin the rates paid to widows with children (or over 40 orincapacitated) of officers in the lower ranks. The costof these proposals would be  1,820,000.(vii) An increase in the rate of children&apos;s allowances for thechildren of deceased other ranks to a flat rate of 11s.a week instead of a descending scale from 9s. Qd. Thecost of this would be  400,000.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the proposalsinvolved an additional expenditure of about  50,000,000 a year.Large as this sum was, the proposals before the War Cabinet repre-sented the minimum likely to satisfy even those Members ofParliament who were most moderate in their demands, and fell farshort of the extravagant demands made by most of the Members whohad taken part in the discussions. There had been special difficultyin reaching agreement on revised scales of War Pensions, and theremight be some criticism of the fact that the flat rate of children&apos;sallowance was only 11s. as against 12s. Qd. for the child of theserving soldier. In his view, it would be most dangerous to raisethe rate over 11s. in view of the repercussions on Assistance Boardrates. He thought that the differentiation might be defended on theground that the wife of the serving soldier had to incur additionalexpenditure in keeping the home together against his return.In discussion, the following points were raised :-r(a) Doubt was expressed whether the proposals, by providingfor higher allowances for officers and men in the lowerranks, did not leave too narrow a gap between theemoluments received by them and those received byofficers and men in the next higher rank. Reference wasmade to the services rendered by officers who had madethe Army their profession, and the fact that seniorofficers, being usually older, had to incur greater expen-diture on the education of their children. In reply, itwas explained that (save in a few wholly exceptionalcases) the increases in pay received on promotion farexceeded the fall in the rate of allowance, and that, ifcorresponding additions were made to the allowancesgiven to officers and men in the higher ranks, therewould be a very heavy increase of expenditure.Moreover,  in  general,  the  proposals   in  regard  to
Army.Minimum Agefor OverseasService.(PreviousReference:W.M. (43) 129thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (44) 205) asking that the &quot;WarCabinet should agree that the House of Commons be asked toapprove that the minimum age at which troops might be sentoverseas should be reduced from 19 years to 18-1.The War Cabinet-Approved this proposal.allowances in the draft White Paper did not apply toofficers who had made their career in the Services, whofor the most part were remunerated on a different basis.(b) Reference was made to a small number of wholly excep-tional cases (e.g., commissioned Warrant Officers in theNavy promoted to the rank of Lieutenant) where theproposals would involve a slight reduction in totalemoluments on promotion. It was agreed that thesecases should be covered by the general principle (whichmight find expression in the White Paper) that no officershould lose by promotion.(c) It was suggested that the White Paper should be recast insuch a way as to show the total emoluments, includingboth pay and allowances, which would be received underthe new proposals. Again, the substantial improvementswhich were being made should be stressed, e.g., the newrates of children&apos;s allowances should be added to thetable in paragraph 11.The Minister of Information offered the assistanceof his Department as regards any points of presentationin the preparation of the revised White Paper. Hewould also be glad to consult with the Departments con-cerned, before the White Paper was published, with aview to the preparation of notes on it for the informa-tion of the Press.(d) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he hoped thatin presenting the proposals to the House nothing wouldbe said which would prejudice the grant of increasesin pay for men retained in the Services for theJapanese war.The question was raised whether some enquirymight not be set on foot with a view to devising a revisedand simplified scheme of pay and allowances for thepost-war Services. The general feeling, however, wasthat not much progress could be made with an enquiryof this kind until further consideration had been givento the future of conscription and the size and structureof the post-war forces.(e) The Secretary of State for War stressed the importance ofensuring that any debate on the proposals in Parliamenttook place at an early date.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposed improvements in Service pay andallowances and in war pensions set out in the draftWhite Paper annexed to W.P. (44) 212.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the ServiceMinisters, in consultation with the Minister of Informa-tion, to recast the White Paper in order to show theeffect of the proposals on the total emoluments of officersand men in the Services and to bring out more clearlythe substantial improvements which were being effected.(3) Agreed that the Prime Minister should inform the Houseof Commons on Wednesday, the 26th April, that copiesof the White Paper would be available for Memberslater in the day.
W.M.(44)30thConclusions,Minute .3.)Miners&apos; Wages.(PreviousReference:5. The Prime Minister said that he had been informed by theMinister of Fuel and Power that an agreement on the wagestructure of the coal-mining industry on the lines agreed by the WarCabinet had been signed that afternoon by representatives of bothsides of the industry.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,20th April, 1944.APPENDIX.Draft Telegram.Prime Minister to Lord Killearn, Lord Moyne and the ThreeC ommanders-in- C Me f.The War Cabinet had, under consideration to-day various telegrams fromthe Middle East about the dispute between King Farouk and his Government.They also re-read the telegrams which had passed on a very similar occasionalmost exactly a year ago. They recommend that all parties should re-read thesetelegrams. They show most clearly the quite needless fears entertained by thethen Commanders-in-Chief, and the gloomy prophesies which were made bythe military authorities. They also show the anxieties expressed by the thenMinister of State, the decisions which were taken here to override these pointsof view, and, the happy results attained by firm action by His Majesty&apos;sAmbassador, not excluding the possible use of force.2. A new complication has arisen on this occasion in the Greek trouble,which involves some of our troops, and which I should like to get settled beforeundertaking further labours. On the other hand, the improvement in the Alliedwar position is very great since this time last year. While therefore the use offorce to bring pressure upon the King cannot be excluded, it is not probable thatit will be required. It is, however, desirable to gain a little time to wear downthe Greek mutineers.3. The following message should be delivered, at his discretion, by LordKillearn to King Farouk :  &quot; The War Cabinet have heard with much concern that Your Majestycontemplates dismissing from office the Government of Nahas Pasha, althoughthis Government has a large majority in the Chamber and has still threeyears of its lawful term to run. From a parliamentary and constitutionalpoint of view this would appear to be a very doubtful and possibly dangerouscourse to embark on. If, however, Your Majesty feels that an immediateGeneral Election would clear the air, and if the Prime Minister is persuadedto submit himself to the electors, a dissolution forthwith would not be asubject on which His Majesty&apos;s Government would feel it right to expressan opinion. The one course which His Majesty&apos;s Government feel it wouldbe especially necessary to avoid would be the installation in office of a PalaceMinister or other Minister not possessing a majority in the Legislature, andthe keeping of this new Minister in power for the purpose of managingthe Election. His Majesty&apos;s Government would find it impossible to defendsuch procedure in public, and would feel bound to instruct their Ambassadorto tender formal advice against such a course. The War Cabinet desire meto say that they would appreciate an expression of Your Majesty&apos;s viewsupon this matter, which might become exceedingly grave, before any furthersteps are taken to bring it to a head.&quot;4. Meanwhile the Commanders-in-Chief should take all necessary steps tomake sure that their forces are marshalled and. ready to give support to theAmbassador should he require it.
