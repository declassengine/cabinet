Town andCountryPlanning.Town andCountry -Planning Bill.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)68thConclusions,Minute 7.)1.   The War Cabinet had before them : (i) a Memorandum by the Minister of Town and CountryPlanning (W.P. (44) 310) covering a revised draft of theTown and Country Planning Bill.(ii) a Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare(W.P. (44) 317) setting out his objections to the compen-sation provisions in the draft Town and CountryPlanning Bill.The Minister of Town and Country Planning said that since themeeting of the War Cabinet on the 24th May (W.M. (44) 68thConclusions) the Reconstruction Committee had given carefulconsideration to the provisions in the Bill relating to compensation,and were satisfied that they represented the best solution of adifficult problem which could be found. They had also reviewed theprocedure for acquisition in the Bill and had recast it in such a wayas to draw a distinction between the procedure for dealing with wardamaged and obsolescent areas respectively, and to impose a limitof five years in the exercise of the exceptional powers which wereconferred on local authorities for dealing with war damaged areas.In addition certain new provisions had been added to the Bill for theprotection of owners of war damaged property.The discussion turned mainly on the provisions of the Bill underwhich compensation would normally be based on 1939 prices.The War Cabinet were informed that when the Bill had beenbefore the Legislation Committee (H.P.C. (44) 19th Meeting) theLord Chancellor, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretaryto the Treasury had expressed the view that the compensation.provisions, especially in their application to buildings as distinctfrom undeveloped land, would be strongly opposed in Parliament,particularly in the House of Lords. In support of this view it wasurged that the provision in the Bill for the payment of additionalcompensation to owner-occupiers of small houses and of agriculturalland went to prove that the general basis of compensation wasunfair. Moreover, owing to the rise in buildings costs and *thegeneral fall in the value of money, the owner who received compensa-tion on the 1939 standard would be unable to reinstate himself. Inthis respect his treatment would be in marked contrast to that of the -majority of owners under the War Damage Act, since they wouldreceive cost of works payments which would enable them to meet thecost of restoring their property at the prevailing level of prices.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that the proposals in theBill were based on the principle that owners should receivecompensation based on the prices ruling at the most recent time whenthere could be said to be a real market in land, and that they didrough justice to owners, whether their property had depreciated orappreciated as a result of war conditions. It was not a principle ofthe law of compensation that it should provide reinstatement, and itcould not reasonably be argued that the special provisions relating toowner-occupiers of small houses, which were designed to help a classwho might be expected to suffer special hardship on beingdispossessed, ought to be extended to all owners. To accept theargument that the rate of compensation should be increased becauseof a fall in the value of money would release a flood of demands forsimilar concessions in other fields, and would lead inevitably toinflation. There would, no doubt, be criticism of the provisions, andthey might have to be amended in one respect or another, but in allthe circumstances the least objectionable course appeared to be toretain the 1939 standard together with the exceptional provision forowner-occupiers.The question whether if the Bill was introduced it would bepossible to pass it into law before the end of the Session,was alsodiscussed. The Bill was long and complicated, and there seemedlittle hope of its being passed before the Summer recess. On theother hand, there were strong arguments in favour of introducing itas soon as possible and it would, no doubt, be possible to find time forits later stages when Parliament had reassembled after the recess.
109w.m. 78 (my.The War Cabinet-Approved the introduction of the Town and CountryPlanning Bill circulated with W.P. (44) 310, subject tosuch minor and drafting amendments as might be foundnecessary, and authorised the Minister of Town andCountry Planning to give notice of the introduction of theBill immediately.Town andCountryPlanning.Control ofLand Use.Draft WhitePaper.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)68thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Reconstruction (W.P. (44) 311) to which was attacheda draft White Paper on the Control of Land Use.The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to the foreword tothe White. Paper, in which it was stated that proposals for con-trolling the use of land had been the subject of keen politicalcontroversy for many years; that no proposals on this subject couldbe wholly satisfactory for all shades of opinion; that a determinedeffort should now be made to find some practical solution of theseproblems; and that the Government presented the paper to Parlia-ment in order to focus public discussion of the difficult issuesinvolved and to assure themselves that there would be a substantialmeasure of public support for a solution on the lines proposed.The attitude indicated in the foreword met with generalapproval.In discussion, the view was expressed that the proposals set outin the White Paper were very far reaching and of extreme intricacy,and that it could hardly be said that Ministers had had time to makefull study of their probable effect and implications. It was alsourged that the compensation provisions were so complex that itwould be very difficult for anyone to know what amount, if any, ofcompensation he was likely to obtain. The scheme was thereforelikely to meet with a great deal of opposition. While it wasrecognised that it was urgently necessary to proceed with theproposals in the Bill for dealing with the blitzed and blighted areas,the wider problems of the control of land use were, it was suggested,essentially long term, and consideration of them should be deferreduntil after the war.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, in view of thehistory of this question and the pledges which had been given, manyof them quite recently, any further deferment would give rise tograve embarrassment. Furthermore, there was much to be said forthe Government putting out a plan, which would be the subject offull and free discussion, and which would show the lines on which agenerally acceptable solution could be framed, before legislation wasintroduced.This view met with general approval.Two specific points on the draft White Paper were referred to.The first was the provision in paragraph 25, that the rate of better-ment charge should be 80 per cent, of the difference between the valueof the land with the benefit of permission to develop and its value ifpermission had been refused. One or two Ministers expressed theview that this figure would have to be revised.The second point was the provision in paragraph.38, that theproposed central Land Commission should be charged with thefunctions, among others, of assessing and paying compensation andbetterment charge. It.was agreed that this paragraph should beamended so as to make it clear that there would be provision forarbitration in appropriate cases, and that the final word would notI rest with the Land Commission.The War Cabinet-Approved the White Paper subject to modification, to meetthe point referred to at &quot; X,&quot; and. authorised the Ministerof Town and Country Planning, and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to present it to Parliament at an early date.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,15th June, 1944.X&apos;
