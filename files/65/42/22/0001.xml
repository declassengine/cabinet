The Chiefs of Staff reported the events of the previousfourteen days.Bomber Command had flown 4,700 sorties and dropped14,300 tons of bombs, almost all of them on targets in OccupiedTerritory. Mosquitoes had attacked targets in Germany,including Berlin.United States bombers had flown 6,500 sorties and dropped12,000 tons of bombs, two-thirds on targets in Germany and the reston railway centres and &quot; Crossbow &quot; targets. 2,000 tons of bombshad been dropped on Berlin in two raids. United States bombershad also attacked synthetic oil targets in Germany, inflicting severedamage on five plants. 2,600 tons of bombs had been dropped on&quot; Crossbow &quot; targets.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force and the Tactical Air Forcehad made 33,000 sorties and had dropped 7,740 tons of bombs.Enemy losses claimed for the fourteen days were 504 aircraftdestroyed, 62 probably destroyed and 189 damaged. Allied lossesincluded 135 British and 126 United States bombers.By night 190 enemy aircraft had been over this country, ofwhich 19 had been destroyed. In addition, 10 enemy aircraft hadbeen destroyed by Intruder patrols. Night attacks by enemyaircraft had failed to achieve any concentration.In the Mediterranean 28,000 Allied sorties had been flown asagainst 2,000 by the enemy. 16,000 tons of bombs had beendropped, half on railway communications and harbours, and halfon enemy airfields in Italy and battle targets. These figuresincluded only the first two days of the land battle. Seventeen vesselshad been sunk and 49 damaged.

Forty-seven small enemy vessels were claimed to havebeen sunk.Fifty-four enemy aircraft had been destroyed in this areacompared with 21 Allied.The War Cabinet-Invited the Chief of the Air Staff to render a return of theestimated output of German fighter and bomber aircraftat a current date and, say, six months ago. The returnshould also give an estimate of the total number of com-pleted fighter and bomber aircraft in reserve, includingthose in transit, on each date.
later been driven back. Elsewhere, along the whole front fromCassino to the sea, good progress had been made, particularly by theFrench troops in the centre. Generally, the situation wasencouraging.Russia, Burma There was no material change in the situation,and the Pacific.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.United 2.   Reference was made to a minute which the Chiefs of StaffKingdom had sent to the Prime Minister, suggesting that the demands ofImport shipping for military operations might make it necessary that thereProgramme. should be a temporary cut in the monthly United Kingdom importprogramme. This would probably result in some reduction in ourreserves. The Prime Minister directed that this minute should becirculated to the Ministers concerned, with a view to its earlyconsideration.This led to the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealandsaying that they would be glad to examine what measures they couldtake with a view to increasing the exports of foodstuffs from theircountries to the United Kingdom.The War Cabinet-Directed the Secretary to arrange that the Dominion PrimeMinisters should be furnished with a selection of signifi-cant figures of our production and import programmes.Prisoners 3.   The Secretary of State for Air referred to a recent telegramof War. from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Berne.   It appeared that on or(Previous about the 25th March 76 officers had escaped from the camp.Reference: Fourteen of these were still at large, 15 had been recaptured andW.M.(44)llth 47, according to the account given to the Swiss Camp Inspector byConclusions, the Camp Commandant, had been killed, some while offeringMinute 3.) resistance on recapture, others on a new attempt to escape aftercapture.It seemed improbable that so large a number of officers shouldhave resisted arrest. Further, some of the recaptured prisoners hadstated that about 30 of their fellows had been seen leaving Gorlitzprison on a lorry, handcuffed, under police escort. The officers killedincluded not only British officers, but also officers of Dominion andAllied forces. The War Cabinet would no doubt desire to considerwhat action should be taken and what announcement should bemade. The next-of-kin had been informed and some statement wouldhave to be made at a very early date.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs proposed that atelegram should immediately be sent to His Majesty&apos;s Minister atBerne, instructing him to ask the Swiss Government to take up thematter at once with the German Authorities, at the highest level,and to demand a full and immediate report on the circumstances inwhich the officers had lost their lives. He suggested that, if possible,no statement should be made until a reply had been received. Fullinformation would be given to the Dominion Governments.The Secretary of State for War agreed that it would bepreferable to await a reply before making any public statement, butdoubted whether a statement could be deferred for more thanforty-eight hours.Mr. Curtin referred to reports about the treatment of prisonersin the hands of Japanese, and said that everything pointed to thefact that they were being badly treated.  The representations so far:
made to the Japanese Government appeared to have had no result.He did not believe that a policy of reprisals would have any effecton the Japanese. He asked whether the Soviet Government mightbe willing to intervene with the Japanese Government.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained that theSoviet Government had already approached the Japanese Govern-ment on this subject, though it was not yet known with what result.The War Cabinet-Approved the draft telegram which the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs proposed to send to His Majesty&apos;sMinister at Berne, and agreed that, if possible, anyGovernment statement should be deferred until a reply hadbeen received.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
