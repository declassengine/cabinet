1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet of the difficulties which had arisen with Generalde Gaulle&apos; over^ the issue of currency notes for the Allied forces whichwere now entering France.&apos; A discussion took place as to the bestmethod of dealing with this problem, and with the connectedquestion of how the various problems arising in connection with thecontrol of civil affairs in France once the Allied forces had estab-lished themselves in that country should be co-ordinated with theFrench National Committee.The Conclusions reached by the War Cabinet were asfollows : &apos;(1) The Secretary of State&apos; for Foreign Affairs, in his forth-coming conversations with General de Gaulle, shouldtake the following line : (a) He should enquire whether General de Gaulle, washimself prepared to discuss with us the variousmatters affecting the control of civil affairs in, France, &amp;c.(b) If General de Gaulle was not willing to do so, theForeign Secretary should say that we should likethree or four members of the French NationalCommittee to come to this country to go into these-matters with His Majesty&apos;s Government. In thatevent, the Prime Minister would inform the.President of the action which was being taken,and would say that we should be glad if thePresident would either send a representative tobe present at the conversations, or would allowAmbassador Winant to sit in at them.(c) If discussions took place here as proposed by us anda reasonable basis of agreement was reached, weshould commend it to the United States, andwould be ready to send a representative over tobe present at the discussions in  he United Statesbetween the representatives of the FrenchCommittee and of the United States Government.(2) The Secretary of State for&apos; Foreign Affairs should, in thefirst place, broach this matter orally with Generalde Gaulle on the basis set out above. Thereafter heshould embody these proposals in a letter to M. Vienot,a draft of which should be submitted to the PrimeMinister. ,(3) Should General de Gaulle decline to accept the proposal in(1) (&amp;) above, we should tell him that we greatlyregretted his decision, which would have to be communi-cated to the French National Committee in a documentwhich might have to be published.(4) As regards the issue of Currency notes for the use of theAllied troops in France, General Eisenhower should beauthorised to take action on his own authority as soonas necessary. If negotiations with the FrenchCommittee proceeded favourably, some eao post factoassociation of the Committee with the, issue of thiscurrency should admit of being arranged at a later date.(5) The Prime Minister undertook to advise The King that, inthe opinion of the War Cabinet, it was undesirable thatHis Majesty should see General de Gaulle, unless anduntil the above conversations had had a satisfactory1 issue.(6) Our policy as regards propaganda should be to encouragethe authority and prestige of the French Committee ofNational Liberation whole, rather than Generalde Gaulle&apos;s personal position, and the Minister ofInformation should be asked to give guidance to thePress in this sense.
