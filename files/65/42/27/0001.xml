The Chiefs of Staff reported the events of the previouseight days.Allied air activities from this country and the Mediterraneanhad exceeded all previous efforts. Taking these two theatrestogether, during the previous eight days 56,000 sorties had beenflown and 44,000 tons of bombs had been dropped.Bomber Command had made attacks on Dortmund andBrunswick. The former had been very successful. Attacks had alsobeen made on &quot; Overlord &quot; targets.United States bombers had had a big week. Their targets inGermany included Kiel, Berlin, aircraft factories and synthetic oilplants. 7,100 tons had been dropped on these targets. In addition,5,500 tons had been dropped on &quot; Overlord &quot; targets.Coastal Command had attacked 12 U-boats, sinking 1 andpossibly sinking 3 others.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force and the Tactical Air Forcehad made 25,000 sorties, dropping 7,320 tons on airfields, railwaycentres, &apos;&apos; Crossbow&apos;&apos; and radar targets in Occupied Territory.Enemy losses claimed for the previous eight days had been429 destroyed and 119 probably destroyed. Allied losses amountedto 244 bombers, 130 fighters and 6 Coastal Command aircraft.In the Mediterranean theatre 20,000 sorties had been flown asagainst 1,500 by the enemy. 11,100 tons of bombs had been dropped,half on the battle area and. the remainder on railway centres andairfields in Southern France, Austria and Northern Italy. TheAllied Air Forces claimed to have destroyed or damaged some4,000 motor transport vehicles since the 12th May. Allied losses inthis theatre amounted to 99 aircraft against 76 of the enemy&apos;s.There had been no shipping losses by enemy action during thepast eight days. Sinkings by enemy action during the month ofMay amounted to a record low figure of 17,780 tons. Sinkings ofenemy merchant ships for this month far exceeded this figure.The Prime Minister said that we must not lose sight of theeffect on the overall shipping position of the United Nations of thereduced rate of shipping losses sustained in recent months.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave an account ofthe progress of the battle in Italy. The fighting had made aconsiderable inroad into the German reserves and there were indica-tions that reinforcements were being moved to &quot;this front from othertheatres. It was thought that the Germans might now take up aline running from Pescara on the Adriatic Coast through Avezzano,Valmontone and Velletri, to the sea.Attention was drawn to the fact that possession of the ViaAppia conferred on us the advantage of greatly improved lateralcommunications. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff under-took to ascertain what use General Alexander intended to makeof this.Biak Island in New Guinea had been captured. Some 50,000Japanese troops were now isolated in the eastern portion of NewGuinea.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements. ; ;Bombing Policy. 2.

&apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos;Security.Restrictionson Personsleaving thisCountry.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)51stConclusions,Minute 5.)X4. The Minister of Information informed the War Cabinetthat the Editor of the Chicago Tribune had arrived here fromAmerica a week ago and was now proposing to return to the UnitedStates. His newspaper had recently committed very serious indis-cretions from the security point of view. Given the generalrestrictions which were being imposed in the interests of security,the Minister suggested that the War Cabinet should refuse to allowhim to leave the country while those restrictions persisted, and thatin future the British Embassy in Washington should be asked notto issue a visa unless permission had been granted by the securityauthorities in the United Kingdom. The decision was one thatought, he felt, properly to be taken by the War Cabinet and not, ashad been suggested, left to General Eisenhower.The Prime Minister invited the Cabinet to decide that apermit should not be given to the person in question to leave thiscountry until the existing restrictions had been relaxed and that, ifnecessary, the matter should be taken up as between Governments.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said heunderstood that the individual in question had been recommendedfor the grant of a visa by the State Department and the WarDepartment as well as by the British Embassy in Washington. Hehad accordingly been admitted to this country under the normalprocedure. Instructions had thereafter been given that he was notto be granted, an exit permit without special reference to higherauthority, but, owing to a misunderstanding, such a permit hadbeen given to him. Orders had been given for this to be stoppedpending further enquiries. Hithero his own attitude had been thatthe Supreme Commander should decide whether or not it wasdesirable on security grounds to allow an individual to leave thecountry, but, if the War Cabinet were now to take a decision in thesense recommended by the Prime Minister, the necessary arrange-ments would be made.After further discussion, the Prime Minister invited the WarCabinet to take a general decision that neither in the case now underconsideration, nor in any other, should permission be granted toany person to leave the country unless His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere satisfied that it was in the interests of the prosecution of theWar and of the United Nations that such permission should begranted, and that his departure could not be postponed.  He wouldbe ready, if necessary, to raise the matter through the personalchannel with the President.The War Cabinet-Approved the course of action recommended by the PrimeMinister at &quot;X,&quot; and invited the. Home Secretary andMinister of Home Security to proceed accordingly.Air Raids. 3.   The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidDamage and that during the previous eight days there had been one medium andCasualties. three small attacks. The medium attack had been against(Previous Portsmouth on the night of the 22nd/23rd May, when aboutReference: 60 long-range bombers had crossed the South Coast. The smallerW M (44) 60th attacks had been against Weymouth, Torquay and Falmouth.Conclusions, Although relatively few aircraft had crossed the coast in theseMinute 3)&apos;      attacks, they had shown a greater degree of concentration thanothers carried out recently.No important damage had been caused, except in the raid onthe previous night against Falmouth, when damage had been doneto the oil installation.The casualties for the period were 30 killed, 47 seriouslyinjured and 9 trapped.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.
5. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a recentexchange of telegrams between himself and the President about asuggestion that General de Gaulle should be invited to come to thiscountry.At the conclusion of the discussion the War Cabinet invitedthe Chiefs of Staff to consider certain questions as to the timing ofthe invitation to be issued to General de Gaulle.A full record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;sStandard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,30th May, 1944.France.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)66thConclusions,Minute 2.)
