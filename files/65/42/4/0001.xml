Civil Aviation.Discussionswith UnitedStates Bepre-sentatives.(PreviousBef erence :W.M. (43) 146thConclusions,Minute 3.)The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that thediscussions between the Lord Privy Seal and Dr. Berle on civilaviation had now concluded, and that it was proposed to issue tothe press an agreed statement (a copy of which is appended to theseminutes). He thought that, before the announcement was issued,the War Cabinet should hear from the Lord Privy Seal an accountof his negotiations and approve the text of the proposedannouncement.The Lord Privy Seal said that the outcome of his discussionswas as follows : (i) Agreement had been reached that the United Kingdomand the United States should go forward to an inter-national conference on the basis of the Report, dated the13th October, 1943, of the Sub-Committee, presidedover by Mr. Harold Balfour, of the British Common-wealth Air Conference. This had been the outcome ofthe discussions between the Dominions and ourselves.Dr. Berle had put forward for consideration a documentwhich would have deprived us of our control of ourairfields without adequate consideration, and wouldhave exposed us to unrestricted competition. We hadsuccessfully resisted this attempt. It had now beensettled that the Balfour Report, and not the documentput forward by Dr. Berle on behalf of the UnitedStates, would be the basis of future conversations,(ii) As already stated, we had resisted attempts to deprive usof the control of our airfields, the position of which wasreserved for discussion at the International Conference.(iii) Colonial cabotage had been conceded by Dr. Berle.(iv) As  regards  international  control  in  relation  to  thestandardisation of the technical development of civilaviation, His Ma.jesty&apos;s Government had, at the time,subscribed to the Paris Convention of 1919. The UnitedStates had refused to do so, and had gone ahead on theirown independent lines since that date. The outcome ofthe present discussions was that the United StatesGovernment agreed to the international control of radioand technical civil aviation devices. That he regardedas a great advance.The Lord Privy Seal added that he felt he could commend tothe War Cabinet the agreement that had been reached as eminentlysatisfactory. The press statement had been agreed by the UnitedStates Ambassador and the United States Government. Dr. Berlewould address a press conference at 3 p.m. on the 8th April, atwhich he (the Lord Privy Seal) would be present. He thought itimportant, given the degree of criticism under which Dr. Berlemight find himself on return to the United States in view of theconcessions he had made to our point of view, that no undue satis-f action with the outcome of these discussions should reflect itself inpress comment in this country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that it was a greatadvance to have secured the Balfour Report as the basis of futureconversations. He enquired the position under that document asregards international control of rates and frequencies of inter-national services. He understood that there was a possibility ofvarying interpretations of its provisions on that most importantpoint.The Lord Privy Seal read to the War Cabinet an extract fromthe proceedings concluding the exploratory conversations with theUnited States. The Balfour Report had been accepted as a basis,granted reasonable flexibility of construction and the usual give andtake of normal negotiations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed himself as entirelysatisfied with this explanation, on the understanding that we shouldinterpret the provisions of the Balfour Report as covering the
international regulation of rates and frequencies, and that ourrepresentatives would attend the conference on this basis.The&apos; Secretary of State for Air emphasised the greatimportance of the two points referred to by the Chancellor of theExchequer, namely, that we were not committed to any departurefrom the recommendations in the Balfour Report in favour of theinternational control of rates and frequencies and internationalservices; and that our representatives would attend any conferencewith instructions from the Government to adhere to the agreedpolicy of the Balfour Report on these points.In reply to the Secretary of State for Air, the Lord Privy Sealexpressed the view that the wise course would be that we shouldnow make a final agreement with the United States and theDominion Governments our chief aim. Conversations between theUnited States and a Soviet Delegation on this subject were at themoment proceeding in Washington. The extension to othercountries of any agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government, onbehalf of the Empire, the Dominions and the United States mightwell follow at a subsequent stage.As regards the position of the Dominions, it was pointed outthat the Balfour Report, on which future talks would be based, hadbeen agreed with them at the time. The Dominions Office had notthought it necessary that the Dominions should be mentioned in theproposed announcement. It was agreed that Dr. Berle should beinvited by the Lord Privy Seal to mention the Dominions in hispress conference to-morrow, and that the press should be remindedabout the other preliminary stages of the negotiations which hadalready been concluded.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft statement to be issued to the press.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider what action wasnecessary for the guidance of press comment.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,7th April, 1944.APPENDIX.Statement to be issued to the Press.The representatives of the two Governments&quot; have consulted together inpreparation for an International Conference on Civil Aviation.They are of opinion that there is sufficient agreement between them to justifythe expectation that final dispositions can be reached at an InternationalConference.They have had in mind that Governments of the U.S.S.R. and other Govern-ments would likewise enter into conversations prior to such InternationalConference.The Governments of the United Kingdom and United States of America haveagreed that international control should govern a considerable field of technicalmatters.&apos; They have -made arrangements for continuing technical conversationsfor the purpose of reaching detailed agreement on the several aspects of this field.
