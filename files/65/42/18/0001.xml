The Prime Minister said that the arrival in this country inthe near future of a considerable number of Russian sailors wasbound to be widely known. He thought that consideration shouldbe given to the question whether Parliament should be informed ofthe decision to loan certain warships to the Russian Government.It was urged that on security grounds it would be better notto make any announcement until the ships had been taken over andhad reached a Russian port. On the other hand, it was pointed outthat, if the ships were not due to leave this country for a consider-able period, the security objections were not very strong.No decision was recorded. The point was noted for furtherconsideration in the near future, together with the questionwhether, on security grounds, there was any objection to giving apublic welcome to the Russian sailors. In the meantime, it wassuggested that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs mightmake enquiries on the matter of the Russian Ambassador.Air Raids.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)41stConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityreported that there had been enemy activity on the first six nightsof last week, chiefly against shipping targets off the south coast.

(42) 119thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet thatBrigadier Maclean was now in this country and briefly reviewed ourgeneral policy in Yugoslavia. That policy, was to unite thosesections which were prepared to fight theGermans and to give themevery support; and, in particular, in present circumstances, tosustain Marshal Tito, who was solidly established, and who wascontaining a very large hostile force. The internal politicalsituation was one of much complexity. The King had been advisedto dismiss General Mihailovitch and his Ministers, but had not yettaken action in this sense. The Ban of Croatia had now been sentfor by the King from the United States.The War Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the WarCabinet that he had that afternoon signed an agreement with theChinese placing at their disposal a credit of  50 million. It wouldbe remembered that the negotiations in this matter had reached adeadlock in the summer of 1942 owing to Chinese demands, whichthey had now abandoned, in regard to its employment after the war.The War Cabinet-Took note with satisfaction of the statement by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
Agreementswith AlliedCountries aboutCivil Affairs.France.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)51stConclusions,Minute 4.)The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs&apos; reminded the WarCabinet that at Moscow it had been agreed that agreements withAllied countries about civil affairs after reoccupation should,before signature, be referred to the European Advisory Commission.There had been some difference of view as to the construction of theMoscow agreement, and, as a result, the signature of agreementsthat had been concluded with the Dutch, the Belgians and theNorwegians had been held,up. The Soviet Government, who hadthemselves been very dilatory in dealing with these agreements, hadnow complained of our alleged delay in disposing of the draft oftheir agreement with Czechoslovakia, of which they had given usonly ten days&apos; notice; and we had in these circumstances remindedthem that we had now been waiting 3^ months for their concurrencein the agreements with the Dutch, Belgians and Norwegians andhad informed them that we proposed to sign those agreements nextweek if no answer had been received.The Prime Minister briefly reviewed the relations between HisMajesty&apos;s Government, the United States Government and theFrench Committee of National Liberation. The position had beenmuch eased by the recent statement by Mr. Hull, and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs would to-morrow publicly indicate thatwe agreed with the position as set out in Mr. Hull&apos;s speech. GeneralEisenhower had now been authorised to enter into discussions withGeneral Koenig, representing the French Committee, about civilaffairs questions when the liberation of French Metropolitanterritory started.ProposedDeclaration toAxis Satellites.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 57thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 235) covering arevised version of a proposed declaration to the Axis satellites,amended to meet the suggestions made at the Meeting of the WarCabinet on the 27th April, which he now proposed to submit forconsideration to the Soviet and United States Governments.The suggestion was made that there might be advantage inadding to paragraph 3 of the revised draft a threat to the leadersof the countries concerned. (This could be done by adding a phrasesuch as &apos;&apos; whether they intend to cast off those who have led themso far astray.&quot;) It was pointed out, on the other hand, that therewas difficulty in drawing a line between those leaders and theircountries, given the apparent readiness of the latter to follow, andto gain such advantage as they could from, their leaders&apos; policy.The suggestion was also made that paragraph 4 of the declara-tion, as redrafted, might be amended to read : &apos;&apos; These nations musttherefore decide now whether they intend to persist in their presenthopeless and calamitous policy of opposing the inevitable Alliedvictory, while there is yet time for them to contribute to thatvictory.&quot;The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wasreluctant to propose to the United States and Russian Governmentsany changes which were not essential; but he undertook to considerthe suggestions that had been put forward.The War Cabinet-Approved the draft, but left discretion to the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs to make such draftingalterations as he might consider practicable in^the light ofthe discussion.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,2nd May, 1944.
