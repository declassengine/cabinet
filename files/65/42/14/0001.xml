Naval, Militaryand AirOperations.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)51stConclusions,Minute 2.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Mediterranean.South-EastAsia.NavalOperations.Meditei*ranean.Indian Ocean.MilitaryOperations.Russia.Burma.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.The scale of air operations from this country in the previousweek had reached the record total of 20,000 sorties. 22,000 tons ofbombs had been dropped.Bomber Command had carried out successful attacks onCologne, Dusseldorf, Brunswick, and 8 important railway centresin occupied territories. Mosquitoes had attacked Cologne, Berlinand Mannheim.United States Bombers had had a satisfactory week, attackingairfields, factories and railway centres in Germany and NorthernFrance, together with &quot;Crossbow&quot; targets.The Allied Expeditionary Force and the Tactical Air Forcehad made 12,000 sorties, attacking railway centres, airfields and&quot; Crossbow&quot; targets. Allied losses for the week amounted to 147bombers (including Tactical Bombers), 43 fighters, and 7 CoastalCommand aircraft.On 5 nights some 253 enemy aircraft had been over this country,in attacks against London, Hull and the Bristol area. Twenty-fivehad been destroyed.In the Mediterranean 10,900 Allied sorties had been flown asagainst 1,000 by the enemy. 2,300 tons of bombs had been droppedon strategic targets and airfields in the Balkans, and on railways,ports and targets in Italy. Enemy losses had been 145 aircraftdestroyed, compared with 74 Allied.A Swedish Red Cross ship, which had failed to notify thatshe was at sea, had been sunk in the Gulf of Lyons.Three thousand five hundred sorties had been flown, comparedwith 100 of the enemy. Twenty-six Japanese aircraft had beendestroyed as against 12 Allied.There had been little air opposition to the landings carried outby Allied troops at Hollandia and Aitape.Losses by enemy action reported in April amounted to61,298 tons. Seven German U-boats had been sunk so far in Apriland 3 probably sunk.The attack by a midget submarine had resulted in sinking an8,000-ton enemy merchant ship at Bergen.On the 20th April, a United States eastbound convoy had beenattacked by about 25 enemy aircraft east of Algiers. A UnitedStates destroyer and two merchant ships had been sunk.Aircraft from carriers supported by the Eastern Fleet hadmade an attack on Sabang on the 19th April. A number of enemyships had been sunk, and 24 aircraft destroyed on the ground.The situation at Bombay, where an ammunition ship had blownup in the Victoria Docks, causing considerable damage, hadmaterially improved.The War Cabinet-Invited the Chiefs of Staff to arrange that a searchingenquiry should be made into this disaster.There had been little change. Generally, the Russians seemedto be concentrating on regrouping and establishing their lines ofcommunication and no major movements were likely in the nearfuture. In the Crimea the Russians were closing in on Sebastopol,but the Germans would probably try to hold on to the port for sometime, partly to deny its facilities to the Russians and partly forreasons of prestige.Our stand at Kohima seemed to have stayed the Japanesethrusts towards Dimapur and Jorhat and we had repelled attackssouth-west of Imphal, while making some progress to the north-eastand north. Generally, the outlook in the Imphal-Kohima area washopeful, more especially since less than a month remained beforethe advent of the monsoon.The Long-Range Penetration Groups continued to harryenemy lines of communication and were giving substantial help tothe Allied Forces in the Ledo Road sector.[27371-3]b 2
On the 22nd April United States Forces, consisting of two tothree divisions, had landed at Aitape, Hollandia and Tanah MerahBay, meeting only light opposition. It was estimated that thislanding would have the effect of cutting off some 70,000 enemytroops.There was no change in the general situation.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.2. The Prime Minister reported that the mutiny in the GreekNavy had been brought to an end by an unconditional surrender ofthe mutinous crews. The position among the Greek Army unitshad proved more difficult, but he had just received a telegram fromGeneral Paget reporting that the brigade had laid down their armsand surrendered.The Prime Minister invited the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs to inform the Dominion Governments ofthe satisfactory ending of this affair.An attempt would probably be made in the near future toconstitute a new Greek Government, representative of all theprincipal parties, under M. Papandreou, who had recently escapedfrom Greece.The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet the latestinformation about the dispute between King Farouk and hisGovernment. The King had told our Ambassador that he wouldnot allow Nahas to go to the country; but it seemed doubtfulwhether the King would proceeed with his proposal to dismissNahas, and to install a Palace Minister who, after a suitable intervalfor the necessary preparations, would have a General Election.Reference was made to the desertion of a number of PolishJews from the Polish Forces in this country. This had been thesubject of some comment and agitation.The Prime Minister suggested that it might be desirable thatthe Polish Prime Minister should have an opportunity of puttinghis side of the case to a meeting of Members of Parliament in thenear future.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook toconsider this suggestion, and to take up the matter with theappropriate authorities.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said the questionhad been raised whether Mr. Stettinius should address a meetingof the Anglo-American Parliamentary Committee.The War Cabinet-Agreed that it would be very advantageous if this couldbe arranged;   and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs undertook to inform Mr. Stettinius accordingly.Use of Tear Gas.3. The War Cabinet considered a Joint Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for theColonies (W.P. (44) 209) asking for approval, in principle, to theuse of tear gas by the police and military in Palestine, in the eventof civil disorders occurring in that country.The Memorandum pointed out that there was a probability ofdanger in Palestine either at the end of the war with Germany orwhen an indication was given of the Governments future policy forthe country. The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, had recom-mended the use of tear gas, and the High Commissioner had statedthat he would be prepared to agree to its use provided that thegeneral authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government had been obtainedin   advance.    The  War  Office  were  in  agreement  with  theNew Guinea.Italy.Foreign Affairs.Greece.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)51stConclusions,Minute 4.)Egypt.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)53rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Deserters fromPolish Forces inUnitedKingdom.Visit ofMr. Stettinius.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 34thConclusions,Minute 2.)
Commander-in-Chief, and the Colonial Office saw no politicalobjection.In discussion it was pointed out that, while no objection couldb*e taken to the use of tear gas by police forces, the proposal that itshould be used by the military was capable of misrepresentation.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for War and the Secretaryof State for the Colonies to bring forward again, in, say,a month&apos;s time, their proposal that preparations should bemade for the use of tear gas by the police and military inPalestine..Electoral 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theReform. Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 214)Parliament proposing that a Bill should be introduced to amend the Parliament(Elections and   (Elections and Meeting) Act, 1943.Meeting) Act, The Memorandum explained that in many areas the clerical1943. work involved in bringing into operation the new system of con-(Previous tinuous registration of electors provided for by the Act was provingReference: beyond the capacity of the available staffs of the electoralW.M. (43) 150th registration officers. A delay or breakdown in one constituency wasConclusions, fatal to the new system, since the appointed day under the ActMinute 7.) could not be fixed in any constituency until preparations werecomplete in all.The position under the Act was that a person was entitled tovote if, on the last day of the month next before that in which theelection was initiated, he had been residing in a constituency for atleast two months and the difficulties were mainly due to this require-ment of two months&apos; period of residence as a qualification forvoting. It was accordingly proposed to amend the Act to providethat there should be no requirement as to length of residence, andthat a person should be entitled to vote if he was residing in theconstituency on the last day of the month next but one before thatin which the election was initiated. This amendment, besidesremoving the danger of breakdown in the clerical arrangements,would also enable the new scheme to be introduced at an earlier datesince, as soon as the preparatory work had. been completed, theappointed day could be fixed without the need to wait for the twomonths&apos; residence qualification to mature.It would be impossible to make the necessary change withoutan amending Bill; but the Bill would be a short one and likely tocommend itself to Parliament. If the War Cabinet agreed inprinciple to the proposal it would be discussed with representativesof the main political parties.The War Cabinet-Approved, in principle, the amendment of the Parliament(Elections and Meeting) Act, 1943, proposed inW.P. (44) 214, and authorised the Home Secretary andMinister of Home Security to discuss it withrepresentatives of the main political parties.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,24th April, 1944.
