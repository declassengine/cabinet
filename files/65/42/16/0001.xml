2.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs (W.P. (44) 219) summarising the material whichhad been prepared in connection with the forthcoming-Meeting.(ii) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs (W.P. (44) 210) on Co-operation in the BritishCommonwealth.(iii) A Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairscovering a Memorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies (W.P. (44) 211) on Regional Bodies inColonial Areas.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) It was agreed that the Prime Minister should make it clearat the opening meeting that the discussions were purelyexploratory in character and would not be directed toreaching hard-and-fast conclusions.(2) It followed that the memoranda before the War Cabinetshould be regarded as material to be used by the UnitedKingdom Ministers in their forthcoming discussions.It was not intended to circulate any of them to theDominion Prime Ministers.(3) The approval given by the War Cabinet to the variousmemoranda before them for use in connection with theforthcoming discussions should be taken as subject tothis general understanding.The War Cabinet then discussed Co-operation in the BritishCommonwealth. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsreminded the War Cabinet that somewhat divergent views weretaken on this subject by the Prime Ministers of Australia andCanada respectively. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom had avoided taking sides in the matter, but it appearedwise to have available compromise proposals for developingco-operation, such as those set out in W.P. (44) 210, which might bebrought forward, if occasion offered.The War Cabinet-(4) Took note with approval of the proposals in W.P. (44) 210.(5) Took note that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairswould communicate to the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs certain suggestions which he had inmind for developing and improving collaboration withthe Dominions in the field of Foreign Affairs.The War Cabinet then discussed the Memorandum preparedby the Secretary of State for the Colonies on International RegionalBodies in Colonial Areas.The Secretary of State for the Colonies referred to theStatement which he had made on the general issue in the House ofCommons in July 1943. The only point of special difficulty arosein connection with regional bodies in Africa. It was likely thatField-Marshal Smuts had in view a region which would includethe whole of Africa, with the exception of the territories borderingon the Mediterranean. To this there appeared to be strongobjection for a variety of reasons.   In his view (a) there would be advantage in a Regional  Commissioncovering Southern and Central Africa (with the Unionof South Africa as an outside Power), to include NorthernRhodesia, Nyasaland, Portuguese East and West Africaand the Belgian Congo. The inclusion of these foreignterritories in British areas would lessen the danger ofUnion domination on-the Commission;..(b) separate treatment was required for West Africa, but thecase for the immediate setting-up of a RegionalCommission was doubtful;
(e) in the case of East Africa, there would not appear to beany practical need for a Commission, but East Africamight be entitled to send observers to the Commissionfor Southern and Central Africa.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs felt that if theprinciple of Regional Councils for colonial territories was accepted,it might be argued that it should cover all such territories. It wouldbe difficult to combine East Africa and South Africa in the sameRegional Council. On the other hand, if large areas of the ColonialEmpire were left outside the Regional Council arrangements, thismight cause misunderstanding with the United States.A general discussion followed, in which the point was madethat the French, because of Madagascar, and perhaps also of Jibuti,were likely to be interested in Regional arrangements affecting EastAfrican territories, while the position of Abyssinia, given thebackward character of that country, was one of difficulty.The War Cabinet-(6) Took note with approval of the general line which theSecretary of State for the Colonies proposed to take indealing with the matter of regional bodies in colonialareas, subject to further consideration of the points thathad been raised in discussion as regards the position ofEast Africa.Closer UnionbetweenSouthernRhodesia,NorthernRhodesia andNyasaland.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Secretaryof State for the Colonies (W.P. (44) 191) on the policy to be adoptedin regard to future relations between the Rhodesias and Nyasaland.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs explained thatSir Godfrey Ffuggins was likely to raise this issue, which was adifficult one. Sir Godfrey was in favour of the amalgamation ofSouthern Rhodesia at the end of the war with the northernterritories. There were, however, serious objections, either toamalgamation or to the incorporation of Southern Rhodesia in theUnion of South Africa. It was desirable at the same time that theWar Cabinet should approve a line which might be followed inentirely private and informal discussion with Sir Godfrey Hugginsin the event of his raising the question. The Secretary of State forthe Dominions said that the two most important proposals which hehad in view for this purpose were : (a) That the existing inter-territorial conference should bestrengthened and put on a permanent basis in the formof a Standing Council, which should be advisory andnot executive. Its function would be to discuss mattersof common interest to the three Territories.(b) That the present inter-territorial Secretariat should beplaced on a permanent basis.He did not anticipate that any arrangement of this naturewould satisfy Sir Godfrey Huggins, but a purely negative attitudewould be difficult to maintain.After discussion the War Cabinet Took note that this matter was not one which was desirableto ventilate as part of the discussions with DominionPrime Ministers, and agreed that the line recommendedin W.P. (44) 191 should be taken by Ministers in privatediscussion in the event of the matter being broached bySir Godfrey Huggins.
CommercialPolicy.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 49thConclusions.)4.   The War Cabinet had before them the following papers : (i) A memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(W.P. (44) 217) suggesting that the Government shouldput before the Dominion Prime Ministers the proposalsfor commercial policy outlined in paragraphs 4 to 12 ofthe memorandum and should inform them that theseproposals were regarded as being in the best interests ofthis country and of the British Commonwealth andEmpire, and as a good basis for further discussion withthe United States at the official level with a view toagreement on a Declaration of Principles on CommercialPolicy similar to that already reached on MonetaryPolicy;(ii) Two memoranda by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries (W.P. (44) 200 and 203) dealing with theproposals in relation to agricultural policy;(iii) A memorandum by the Secretary of State for India(W.P. (44) 224) suggesting that, if the proposals wereput before the Dominion Prime Ministers, it should beon the clear understanding that the Government werenot committed to them; and(iv) A memorandum by  the Minister  of  War  Transport(W.P. (44) 227) stressing that the prosperity of theBritish shipping and shipbuilding industries dependedon the expansion of world trade.The discussion concentrated on the question of how theproposals should be presented to the Dominion Prime Ministers,The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : -(1) The proposals in paragraphs 4 to 12 of W.P. (44) 217should be presented to the Dominion Prime Ministers asa scheme which had been worked out with much care andwas a valuable contribution to the study of the subject.(2) It should be explained to them that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were in no way committed to these proposals.Indeed, they touched on matters on which agreement wasnot easily reached in a Coalition Government comprisingthe three main political parties; and it could not besaid that the difficulties to which they gave rise had yetbeen resolved.(3) Notwithstanding the above, it should be made clear to &quot;theDominion Prime Ministers that there was a very generalmeasure of agreement among all parties in this countryon the desirability of fostering trade within theCommonwealth?and Empire.(4) Reference might also be made to the doubts which had beenexpressed as to the position of the agricultural industryin this country under the proposals.(5) The Dominion Prime Ministers should be asked to give usthe benefit of their views on the proposals, it beingexplained that it was contemplated that the next stagewould be further official talks with the United Stateswith a view to preparing an agreed Statement ofPrinciples, the publication of which might be authorisedby Ministers, as a basis for discussion and furthernegotiation, following the procedure adopted in regardto the scheme for an International Monetary Fund.(6) The President of the Board of Trade was invited to preparea memorandum, summarisng the proposals which hademerged from the official talks, in a non-committal formsuitable for communication to the. Dominion PrimeMinisters.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,27th April, 1944.
NO CIRCULATION-     54W.M.(Uh)  58TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTB 2(27th April,  19kk - 6.30 p.m.)POST-WAR During the discussions on the papers prepared forV/ORLD the Meeting with the Dominion Prime Ministers, referenceORGANISATION     was made to post-war world organisation.THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER drew attention to theimportance of ensuring that the British Commonwealthshould speaK as a single unit.      If that could be secured,the Empire would be in as strong a position, in dealingwith the problems of the post-war v/orld, as the U.S.A.and the U.S.3.R.      If, on the other hand, the Dominionsinsisted on taking their own line and being dealt withindividually as separate nations, the Empire as a wholewould be in a much less satisfactory position.THE PRIME MINISTER felt that the three (or four)Great Powers were likely in any event to have to continueto bear the burden and to exercise the real authority.The type of world organisation which he had in his mindas a possibility was one in which there would in the firstplace be three or four Great Powers with whomresponsibility for maintaining the peace of the worldwould in practice rest.There would be a World Court of Justice whichwould handle questions which might lead to war, and dealwith disputed issues arising out of the application oftreaties,  the drawing of frontiers and the like.There would be a World Assembly of which allStates, who so desired, would be members, whether theywere important or unimportant.There would, finally, be a series of RegionalCouncils.      At the moment he was inclined to think thatRegional Councils for Europe, America and Asia might meetthe case.      If the arguments for an African Council provedon examination to1 be sufficiently strong,  that could beconsidered also but he felt doubtful at the moment if theywere.      The Regional Councils could, as occasion mightdemand, be associated with the three or four Great Powers.The special position of the U.K.  in relation to Europe;the position of authority of Canada in the Americancontinent;    our position and responsibilities in Asia andour African commitments would establish the BritishEmpire in the various Councils.      In the world structure$ that he had in view,  ultimate authority, as he hadexplained, for keeping the peace would be concentratedin the hands of the three Great Powers,  but the Dominionsand other important and historic countries would beassociated with the three Great Powers through the workingof the Regional Councils.THE PRIME MINISTER added that it was,  in hisjudgment,  essential that any organisation establishedshould be sufficiently strong, and that it should be basedon a frank acceptance of the realities of the position.

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY urged the need for somethingcorresponding approximately to the Council of the Leagueof Nations.      There would be great  tactical difficultiesin confining the controlling element in the worldorganisation to three or four Great Powers.      Represent-atives of,  say,  ten or twelve States might meet the case,so that the Council need not become unmanageably large.It was clearly important to have the United Statesassociated with the solution of difficulties in Europeand we could not be certain of their support if theywere not closely associated with these problems as theydeveloped.      Could we hope that they would come in andhelp us to keep the peace in Europe in any other event?3o far as the Dominions were concerned, under the Leaguesystem they had normally held, one seat on the Council inrotation in the past, and he thought that such anarrangement would most appeal to them.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS saidthat the Dominions might use the argument that greatwars almost invariably arose from European circumstancesand might feel a grievance that they should not have avoice in dealing with European affairs if they were to berequired to participate in wars that might arise from thehandling of those affairs.THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OF HOME SECURITYthought that there was a good case for a world authorityto deal with political and economic issues.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was no escapefrom the fact that the real force and the real authorityrested with the three or four Great Powers.      Anyorganisation set up to deal with the post-war situationmust be a reality and not a sham.      That could be securedonly if the effective control was concentrated in thesmallest number of hands.      That was consistent withassociating other Powers with the three or four Greatlowers in such a way as to ensure that they had a voicein the handling of affairs.      he appreciated the point ofview of the Dominions, but he felt that this issue mighthave to be faced with them,  given the reactions in otherQuarters of special provision for them.      He agreed thatit was important that we should be able to look forUnited States assistance in keeping the peace of the worldHe did not, however,  feel thao any insuperable difficultyneed be experienced in making arrangements which wouldsuitably associate them e.g.  with regional arrangements inEurope.      We must go cautiously in considering abstractproposals for establishing world authorities in thepolitical or economic field.      The plain fact of thematter was that the future of the world was in the handsof the three or four Great Powers.      It was essentialthat they should be strong and that they should work to-gether.      If they did not work together, the resultswould, be disastrous.Offices of the War Cabinet,S . W.  1 a
