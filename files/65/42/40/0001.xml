2.  The Chiefs of Staff reported the events of the previous week.Bomber Command had flown 3,665 sorties for a loss of90 aircraft and had dropped 11,000 tons of bombs. One heavyattack had been made on two oil plants in the Ruhr area. Railwaycentres and &quot; Crossbow &quot; targets had also been attacked.Mediterranean.NavalOperations.Naval, Militaryand AirOperations.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)80thConclusions,Minute 2.)Air Operations. American heavy bombers had attacked oil targets in GermanyHome Theatre, by day on three occasions with good results. In one operation theAmericans had sent 160 aircraft to bomb targets in EasternGermany. The aircraft had then flown on to Russia. There, owingto lack of adequate defence, they had lost 56 aircraft destroyed onthe ground by German air attack.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 27,000 sorties.The enemy had lost 335 and the Allies 412 aircraft in the week.In the Mediterranean theatre 8,600 sorties had been flown asagainst 560 by the enemy.  Enemy losses amounted to 76 as against55 Allied aircraft.During the previous wveek confirmed shipping losses due toenemy action amounted to 7,555 tons. Total losses for June to dateamounted to 34,244 tons.During June 12 U-boats had been destroyed and 6 probablydestroyed.Bad weather considerably impeded unloading operations on theBritish beaches in North-West Erance during the early part of theweek.Three American battleships, two American cruisers and twoBritish cruisers bombarded Cherbourg on the 25th. Whilst doingso they came under accurate fire from shore batteries and somewarships had received slight damage.On the night of the 23rd June M.T.Bs. had intercepted anenemy convoy consisting of seven small ships south of Jersey,sinking two ships for certain and probably three others. On thefollowing night another enemy ship attempting to leave Cherbourghad been sunk and three others damaged.Military The United States Army had first driven across the Cherbourg-Operations.      Peninsula.   The enemy divisions cut off had withdrawn withoutNormandy.      offering much opposition until reaching the Cherbourg defences,when firm resistance had been offered; but the port had now beenoccupied.The British 30th Corps in the Tilly area had been engaged inheavy fighting and had inflicted considerable loss on the enemy. Theenemy had been driven southwards across the road running east andwest through Tilly. On the 25th June the 49th and 50th Divisionsseized ground south-east of Tilly, and the following day the15th Division, supported by a heavy artillery barrage, attackedsouth from the area Norrey-en-Bessin. This attack was progressingfavourably..Italy. In the last few days the enemy&apos;s resistance in the area of LakeTrasimeno and westwards had stiffened considerably and it seemedMr. Fraser. 1.   The Prime Minister said that all his colleagues wouldregret that this was the last occasion on which Mr. Fraser wouldattend a meeting of the War Cabinet on his present visit to thiscountry. Mr. Fraser&apos;s presence here during these critical andmomentous days had been of great value. The New Zealand Govern-ment had made a typically generous gesture in deciding to leave theNew Zealand Division in Italy, where under General Alexanderscommand they were adding to their splendid record of achievement.Mr. Fraser thanked the Prime Minister warmly for what hehad said. He counted it a high privilege to have been here in thesedays. He would return to New Zealand with confidence, if possible,strengthened in the efficiency with which the central direction ofthe war was being conducted.
that he intended to&apos;stand for as long as possible on that general line.Progress had, however, been made, particularly in both coastalsectors.During the past week our forces had cleared the Kohima-Imphal road. The road from Dimapur to Imphal was now open tothrough traffic and in use by motor transport convoys. East ofKohima the enemy appeared to be rapidly withdrawing southwards.In North Burma General StilwelFs forces, with the assistance ofour own long-range penetration groups, had brought about the fallof Mogaung.The Russians had begun an important offensive north of thePripet Marshes. This was making good progress and Vitebsk hadfallen.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.3.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) A Note by the Home Secretary and Minister of HomeSecurity (W.P. (44) 343), covering reports by theResearch and Experiments Department of the Ministryof Home Security summarising the information collectedby the Department on the subject of flying bombs upto 24th June; and(ii) A Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security (W.P. (44) 348), on the flying bomb andthe rocket.The Home Secretary and Minister for Home Security gave areport of the casualties and damage caused by flying bombs sincethe attacks had begun. About 1,600 peoj)le had been killed, 4,500had been seriously injured, and nearly 5,000 slightly injured. About1,500 flying bombs had been launched, of which nearly 600 hadentered the London area. Over 200,000 houses had been damagedto a greater or less extent and, although the Ministry of Works hadbeen extremely active in the repair of war damage, they were findingit difficult to keep up with the damage caused. The result was thatconsiderable numbers of people were homeless. The attacks hadled to serious loss of sleep and the fact that they went on continuouslymeant that there was no relaxation of the strain and, in particular,made parents anxious for the safety of their children. After fiveyears of war the civil population were not as capable of standingthe strain of air attack as they had been during the winter of1940-41. If flying bomb attacks were supplemented by rocketattacks, which according to reports might do as much damage ashad been experienced in the heaviest 1940-41 raiding, the CivilDefence machine, which was much weaker in numbers than it hadbeen in 1940-41, might prove unable to cope with the attacks, andthere might be serious deterioration in the morale of the civil popula-tion.&apos; The suggestions as to possible additional action to counter theattacks made in W.P. (44) 348 were put forward tentatively, and hewas mainly concerned to stress that the effect of the attacks couldnot be brushed aside lightly, but must be treated as a major elementin the strategy of the war.Everything possible was being done under the direction of theCivil Defence Committee to mitigate the effects of the attacks.Shelter accommodation was adequate. Steps had been taken sometime ago to strengthen street shelters with the result that they hadstood up reasonably well to the flying bombs. The main problemwas to induce people to use the public shelters which were available.The plans for the evacuation of priority classes were being keptunder review, and if any general demand for evacuation appearedthey would put them into force.Air Raids.Attacks byFlying Bombs.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)80thConclusions,Minute 4.)
The Lord President of the Council and the Chancellor of theExchequer supported the view that the continuous nature of theflying bomb attacks was imposing a particularly&quot; heavy strain onthe civil population. Even in the worst period of the winter of1940-41 there had been considerable breaks during which thepopulation had had a chance to recover.The Minister of Aircraft Production reported that while ingeneral the morale of the workers was good, the attacks had led toa marked increase of absenteeism among married women.The Minister of Labour and National Service suggested thatmore might be done to mitigate the effect of the attacks on thecivilian population by prompt action to provide for the comfort ofthose who suffered under the attacks. Homeless persons shouldbe removed from rest centres to more comfortable quarters as soonas possible, even though this meant transferring them to other partsof London, and where such transfers took place, transport should beprovided for the workers. More might be done, particularlyby the use of mobile canteens, to ensure that the feeding arrange-ments for persons rendered homeless were adequate. It wasof great importance that the repair of damaged houses shouldbe executed as quickly as possible, and workers from other areasshould, if necessary, be brought to London for this purpose. In the1940-41 raids it had been arranged to borrow a certain number ofbuilding workers temporarily from the Army, and he suggested thatthe Secretary of State for War might consider whether it would bepossible for him to release a number of slaters and tilers so thatthe work of roofing damaged houses might be carried on with thegreatest possible speed.The Prime Minister said that everything possible had been doneto counter the flying bomb and rocket, though the enemy had perhapshad a short respite while our air forces had been concentrated, on thepre-invasion assault. He realised that the civil population wereunder a considerable strain and the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security was right to bring these matters to the notice ofthe War Cabinet. But the hardships imposed on them must be con-sidered in comparison with what was being suffered by the-enemypopulation who were subjected to our air raids. It would be unwiseto fely on any diminution in the scale of casualties and damageeven though our defences should improve. It was therefore of thefirst importance that everything possible should be done to providefor the victims of the attacks and nothing should be allowed to standin the way of the repair of damaged houses and the provision ofalternative accommodation and emergency feeding for the peoplewho lost their homes. A further point was that it might be foundby experience that the system of warnings required modification.He attached great importance to encouraging the people to useshelters, particularly at night, so that they might sleep undisturbed,and steps should be taken to improve the sleeping accommodationand general amenities of public shelters. He was not afraid thatthe civil population would lose their morale provided they weresatisfied that everything had been done to help those who hadsuffered under the attacks and provided that the scale of the attackswas not exaggerated.In the course of discussion, reference was made to a number ofoperational matters, including the question of counter-measures.A record is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet (1) Took note of the information which they had been givenwith regard to attacks by aircraft on flying-bomb androcket sites, and intruder patrols over the areas fromwhich the flying bombs were launched; and of the stepswhich were being taken to counter flying bombs by theuse of fighters, anti-aircraft guns, and balloons.
(2) Agreed that the Civil Defence Committee should considerfurther what steps could be taken to mitigate the effectof the attacks on the civil population.   In particular (a) Every effort should be made to improve the amenitiesof public shelters and to encourage the maximumuse of shelters for sleeping purposes in order thatworkers might get an undisturbed night&apos;s rest.(b) The highest priority should be given to the repair ofdamaged property in the London area and, ifnecessary, labour should be brought from otherareas.The Secretary of State for War undertook toconsider whether slaters and tilers could betemporarily loaned by the Army to assist in first-aid repairing.(c) In view of the anxiety of parents for the safety oftheir children, the plans for the evacuation ofpriority classes should be reviewed in order toensure that they could, if necessary, be operatedat short notice.(d) Attention was drawn to the importance of doing allpossible to provide emergency feeding arrange-ments, and adequate accommodation for thoserendered homeless.(3) Took note of the reports by the Research and ExperimentsDepartment of the Ministry of Home Security, circulatedwith W.P. (44) 343.WomanAlleged to bea Sniper.(PreviousEef erence:W.M.(44)79thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The War Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 342) setting-out the facts so far ascertained about the German woman allegedto be a sniper. At present, no evidence to substantiate the allega-tion had been received. If it should be received, the Home Secretaryand Minister of Home Security agreed that the woman must bereturned to France and tried by a military court. In the meantime,she would be kept in prison, under the Royal Prerogative, as acivilian of enemy nationality.National Dayof Prayer.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44)29thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security statedthat the Archbishop of Canterbury had proposed that Sunday, the3rd September, should be declared a National Day of Prayer. Heproposed to advise His Majesty The King that this proposal shouldbe accepted.The War Cabinet-Approved this suggestion.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,27th June, 1944.
