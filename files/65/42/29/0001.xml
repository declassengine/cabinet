Foreign Affairs^ 1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theColonel Beck. War Cabinet that since the occupation of Poland, Colonel Beckhad been living in Roumania under close supervision. He was nowseriously ill. The Polish Government had informed us that, therewas a chance that his friends might be able to arrange for hisescape from Roumania to Turkey; and that the Turkish Goyern-ment, although unwilling to give him refuge in Turkish territory,were prepared to arrange for his transit through Turkey, if HisMajesty&apos;s Government agreed to give him refuge.Colonel Beck had been the Polish Minister for Poreign Affairswith whom the Anglo-Polish Alliance was negotiated in 1939. Hehad proved himself to be a loyal ally, and, since the occupation ofPoland, his conduct had not been in any way open to criticism.There was no doubt, however, that the Soviet Government regardedhim as a symbol of all that they most disliked and distrusted inPolish policy before the war.It was pointed out in discussion that Colonel Beck&apos;s earlierrecord had been far from good; and that he had been involved inthe dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in 1938. If His Majesty&apos;sGovernment agreed to the request without consultation with theSoviet Government, they would arouse the suspicions of the SovietGovernment. . On the other hand, if His Majesty&apos;s Governmentinformed the Soviet Government that the Polish Government wereinteresting themselves in the fate of Colonel Beck, the result wouldbe detrimental to relations between the Polish and SovietGovernments.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to tryto persuade the Polish Government to withdraw theirrequest that refuge should be provided for Colonel Beckin British territory.(2) Agreed that, if the Polish Government pressed theirrequest, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, should, without indicating that the Polish Governmentwere involved, inform the Soviet Government that it hadbeen suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldprovide refuge for Colonel Beck in British territory andinvite their views.Yugoslairta. 2.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that no(Previous       Serb was willing to join the new Government which King PeterBeference:      was&apos;in process of forming unless His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldW.M.(44)67th give  an undertaking to  support General Mihailovitch.

Thenecessary documents were being signed, and a declaration byKing Peter on the lines which we had suggested would be published. to-day.&apos; The aim of the new Government would be to co-operatewith all genuine resistance movements, and it was intended that theBan of Croatia should go to Bari in order to establish contact withMarshal Tito.  Recent information showed that Marshal Tito andthe British Mission with him had eluded the efforts of the enemyto capture them.The Prime Minister said that steps should be taken to makesuitable provision at Bari for the reception and accommodation ofthe Ban of Croatia.
Jewish 3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theRefugees. High Commissioner, Jerusalem, had been approached by the(Previous Jewish Agency about a proposal made by the Gestapo for theReference: transfer of Jews now in Yugoslavia, Roumania, CzechoslovakiaW.M.(43)16th and Ppland. It was stated that the German Government would beConclusions, willing to evacuate a million Jews from those countries to SpainMinute 6.) and Portugal in return for the delivery of ten thousand motorlorries and certain quantities of coffee, tea, cocoa and soap. There, was a threat that if the offer was not accepted there would befurther wholesale massacres of Jews.It was clear that the proposal was simply designed toembarrass the Allied Governments in prosecution of the war, andthe Committee on the Reception and Accommodation of Refugees,who had considered the offer on the previous day, were satisfiedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government could not possibly accept it.The Committee had also suggested. that in intimating theirdecision, which would be conveyed through the Protecting Power,His Majesty&apos;s Government should make it clear that they would dowhat they could to provide for any small numbers of Jews whomthe German Government might be prepared to release and whomight be transferred without interference with military operations.He proposed to communicate with the United States Govern-ment in this sense, and would send a copy of his telegram to hiscolleagues for their information.The War Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the course of action proposedby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Britain.Allegationsmade byMr. Kendall,M.P.United States 4. On the 25th May, Mr. Kendall, M.P., had made seriousForces in Great allegations in a Parliamentary Question about the conduct - ofUnited States troops in&quot; Grantham. These charges had beenformally denied by Lord Brownlow, Lord Lieutenant ofLincolnshire, by the Mayor of Grantham and by the WatchCommittee. A report indicating that they were unjustified hadbeen sent to the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security bythe Chief Constable of Grantham.The War Cabinet now were informed that a letter had beenreceived stating that Mr. Kendall proposed to hold a meeting onthe following day in order to discuss the charges which he had madeabout the conduct of United States Forces in Grantham. It wasrepresented that such a meeting would be most detrimental torelations with the United States Forces, and that it would bedeplorable if wide publicity were to be given to charges of this kindat this juncture.The War Cabinet was informed that the meeting took the formof an invitation to 20 Or 30 leading citizens to attend luncheon andto hear certain statements regarding the conduct of Americantroops. The building in which the meeting was to be held was not,as had been alleged,&apos; a &quot; protected place.&quot; Moreover, it was clearthat no action could be taken to prohibit the meeting under DefenceRegulation 39e.The War Cabinet- &apos;(1) Took note of the statement made by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs tocommunicate with the appropriate authorities in Italywith a view to ensuring that suitable provision wasmade for the reception and accommodation of the Banof Croatia at Bari.
The War Cabinet-Decided that in the circumstances the best course was thatall possible action should be taken to prevent publicitybeing given to Mr. KendalFs allegations. The Ministerof Information was asked to approach the Press in thissense.The Dufour 5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theCase. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 286) about theDufour case. M. Dufour, a French national, had instituted civilproceedings against General de Gaulle, Colonel Passy and sixothers, alleging, inter alia, maltreatment and claiming damages. Ifthe case came on in the courts the allegations would certainly begiven considerable prominence. A written defence had been put inin the usual form denying the charges, but no further action hadbeen taken by the defendants. It seemed that General de Gaulleconsidered it beneath his dignity to defend himself against thecharges and felt that it was the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to prevent the case being brought. He adhered to thisattitude, notwithstanding the fact that it had been- made clear toboth sides that His Majesty&apos;s Government had neither the powernor the wish to interfere with the course of justice.In the course of discussion, the position of General de Gaulleas regards diplomatic immunity was mentioned. It was notaltogether clear whether this point had been explored. It seemedprobable that His Majesty&apos;s Government could confer diplomaticimmunity on General de Gaulle, and if he was prepared to pleadit the result would be that the case would proceed against thesubordinates who, presumably, were really responsible for thealleged maltreatment.In that event, judgment against the defendants would notinvolve General de Gaulle, with all the unfortunate consequenceswhich would follow therefrom. It was agreed that this aspect ofthe matter should be further examined, and that it should also beconsidered whether any action could properly be taken to postponethe hearing of this case.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Attorney-General and arepresentative of the Home Office to examine the matterfurther on the lines indicated in discussion.Prance.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)70thConclusions,Minute 5.)6.

A record of the discussion iscontained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War CabinetConclusions.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,1st June, 1944.
