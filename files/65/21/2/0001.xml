The War Cabinet had before them copies of-  a Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the ExchequerExcess Profits which were handed round at the Meeting and laterTax. returned.(previous reference: The following were the main points made in w.M.(41) 3rd        the Chancellor&apos;s statement and the subsequentConclusions,        discussion:-Minute S.)(1)    It would be undesirable to vary the rateof tax, or to introduce amendments intothe basis on which the tax was charged,apart from the Budget.(S)   There would be every advantage in theChancellor making his Budget statement at an earlier date than usual, evenalthough, for Parliamentary reasons, itmight not be possible to make progress with the Budget Resolutions until thenormal season.     There was much to besaid for giving taxpayers as long noticeas possible of the proposals which wouldhave to be included in the forthcoming budget.     Many people were finding itdifficult to adjust themselves to the burdens imposed upon them by increases in taxation.(3)   The Chancellor&apos;s Memorandum set out two main possibilities:-(a) Reduction in the rate of tax:(b) Introduction of various amendments in the statutory basis on which the tax was charged.The view generally expressed was thattthere would be great difficulty in any scheme which did not maintain the principleof the 100% rate of tax.

(4)   In practice the &quot;best plan would almost certainly he a combination of the twomethods.     The essential feature of thescheme would be that, while the full100% would   continue to be collected,some proportion say 20% wiDOild^be--regardedas a loan repayable at the end of the war,subject to certain conditions, for thepurposes of reconstruction and reconditioning&quot;.(5)    THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO, who had sent a personal letter to the   Chancellorof the Exchequer, which was read out,emphasised the importance of industrybeing in a position to carry out thenecessary reconditioning and re-adaptationfor peace purposes after the war, and of having sufficient funds to enable researchto be re-started;     otherwise we should be faced with a heavy period of unemployment.Such a scheme would, in the Minister&apos;view, be feasible if combined with ascheme for limiting dividends.(6)    THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL service said that it was necessary to make sure that any loans repayable out of ExcessProfits Tax after the war were not usedfor inflationary flotations, as had happened at the end of the last war.The money must be spent in the nationalinterestoTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER observedthat this principle had already beenembodied in the War Damage Bill.It was also suggested that one of theconditions of the repayment by theExchequer after the war of that part of excess Profits Tax which represented a loan should be that the firms should atthe same time use their own reserves forthe work of reconstruction am expansion.(7)    Some discussion took place on thevarious alternative amendments whichmight be made in the statutory basis of the tax (Paragraph 5 of the Chancellor&apos;sMemorandum).      It was pointed out that not all of them provided incentive to theManagement.The War cabinet&apos;s Conclusions were asfollows(i)    It would not be desirable to amend the100% Excess Profits Tax, except as part

of the Chancellor&apos;s general budget proposals:(ii)    There would he every advantage in theChancellor making his Budget speech atan earlier date than usual.(iii)    The   Chancellor of the Exchequer was askedto continue the examination of thepossibilities set out in his Memorandum,together with any further suggestions whichmight he communicated to him by Ministers.(iv)   The Chancellor was also asked to consult the Minister of Supply and the presidentof the Board of Trade as to whether his proposals would provide the necessaryincreased incentive.(v)   When this examination and consultationhad taken place, the matter should again be brought before the War Cabinet, perhapsas part of the Chancellor&apos;s general budget proposals.Great George Street, S.W..1.

1.      In accordance with the invitation of the War Cabinet(W.M.(41) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 2) I submit the following comments on the possibilities of amending 100$ Excess profits tax with a view to the provision of increased incentive.2.      There are two main possibilities -(a) reduction in the rate of the tax, or(b) the introduction of various amendments, in the statutory basis on which the tax is charged, designed to mitigate thepresent effect of the tax,3.      The reduction in the rate, to be of any real effect,ought not to be less than say 2Qf*9 i,e. a reduction to 80$.The remaining 20% would continue to be subject to Income Tax.The political difficulties of such a proposal need no emphasis?,at the best I should not myself have thought that it was possiblefor this alternative to be considered unless it were to be accompanied by some arrangement under which the 10055 would continue to be collected, but with 80$ regarded as a tax and20/5 as a loan repayable to the trader at the end of the war(subject to the retention of Income Tax at the rate In forcewhen the profit was made).4.      The second alternative, of amendments In the structure of the tax without alteration in the rate, obviously hasconsiderable political and psychological advantages as comparedwith any proposal-which reduces the rate below 100$.    There: is,moreover, reason to expect that if the detailed amendments were properly constructed and explained they might still be capable of achieving the object in view without provoking, to anything like the same extent, thee criticism which would inevitably follow a reduction of the rate.5.     The principal amendments might take the following fermi*

(a) Businesses which make an excess profit in one period and a deficiency of profit below their standard in anotherperiod are allowed under the existing law to set off the deficiency against their excess profits.    An undertaking mightbe given that whatever the date of repeal of the duty, it should at any event remain in force for a period of two years afterthe war for the purpose of claiming relief for deficiencies of post-war profit.    The relief would have to be not the wholedeficiency but a percentage of it not exceeding 80$, lest an incentive should be given to firms to reduce their profitsimmediately after the war to an excessive extent for the benefitof subsequent profits, e,g. by an excessive outlay onadvertising.This would intrinsically be a valuable and Importantconcession.     One of the great anxieties of businesses at thepresent time is that they may be faced with very seriousdeficiencies of profits, and indeed very serious losses, afterthe war.    If they feel that they can recoup against these losses a high proportion of the excess profits which they havemeanwhile surrendered to the Stats it will be a great advantage to them.(b) An improved allowance for increased capital employed inthe business and for capital of new businesses.(c) The grant of an allowance In respect of increasedborrowed capital.(d) Some alteration in the present treatment of the managementfees which are paid to companies for undertaking the management of government-owned factories,(e) It may be desirable to make more specific (so as to give greater assurance to traders) the statutory provisions covering the depreciation in value of war installations which will not berequired or will only be of limited value after the war.

(f)   There ere also serious and complicated questions affecting companies working wasting assets such as tin andcopper mines.    The subject is extremely difficult   inits technical aspects and discussions are pending betweenthe Board of Inland He venue and representatives of industry.Ho doubt some solution could be found.6.    X am apprehensive of the idea that I should deal in isolation with the Excess Profits Tax without regard to thegeneral financial problem and to the proposals for increased taxation which in one form or another must Inevitably figure in ay next Budget.    Xt would be better to deal with the whole matter at one- time.7.    1 suggest, therefore, that the examination of thepossibilities set out in the preceding paragraphs of thismemorandTsa (and of other suggestions such as that mentionedorally by the Minister of Labour) should be continued by theTreasury and by the Board of Inland Revenue as a matter of urgency.    I should also propose to have discussions9 in confidence, with three or four leading industrialists.    1shall then be in a position to make positive recommendations tothe Cabinet and, If my enquiries show that action is possible,I would propose to take action in my next Budget which Ipropose, to expedite. .X*WfTreasury Chambers,13th Januaryt 1941

f.M. (41) 6TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(14th January, 1941 - 12.30 p.in.)THE BALKANS.german intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 5thConclusions,Minute 2.)THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had received a Minute from the PrimeMinister in regard to Telegrams Nos. 61, 62 and 64from our Minister at Belgrade.     Prince Paul ofYugo-Slavia was alarmed at our proposal to sendincreased military assistance to Greece, and tobuild up a Salonika front.     He took the view,apparently, that this would provoke the Germans intomaking a strong attack on Salonika;    whereas if we continued as at present they were unlikely to do so,at least for the present.In his Minute, the Prime Minister had saidthat it was for the Greeks to say whether they wanted General Wavell to visit Athens, and to bethe judges of the German reactions.     All theevidence pointed to a German move south.The Foreign Secretary said that he viewedthis matter in exactly the same light as the primeMinister.     He then read to the War Cabinet a draft telegram which had been prepared before the threetelegrams from Belgrade had been received.     he proposed still to send this^ telegram^ and to followit with a further telegram/saying that our views were entirely unaltered by the views expressed byPrince Paul.     We were not proposing to send a forcecapable of carrying out offensive operations againstGermany, but only of helping to defend Greece againsta German attack through Bulgaria.The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to show the draft telegrams, before theywere despatched, to the Chiefs of Staff and toobtain their concurrence.The War Cabinet approved the lineof action proposed 0Great George Street, S.W..1.(THIS DQCuMEjnT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT..)T0 BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.&apos;It Is requested that special ca&apos; e may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.
