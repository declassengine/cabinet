(41) 15th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 5,Confidential Armex0/5th February, 1941 - 12,30 p,mu)THE PRIME MINISTER said that the First Lordof the Admiralty had informed him that- Italianconvoys had recently been crossing the Sicilian channel and proceeding down the Tunisian coast in Frenchterritorial waters.    The Admiralty already had authority to intercept French merchant ships in Frenchterritorial waters in the Gibraltar area.    It was important that the Admiralty should have authority to sink enemy ships in French territorial, waters South ofLatitude 35046! North,    The Foreign Secretary was inagreement with this view, and instructions had beengiven in this sense,    He hoped that the War cabinet would approve this action.The War Cabinet endorsed the action taken.Later in the Meeting it was proposed that a message should be sent by the Admiralty in reply to a message received from the Commander-in-Chief, mediterranean to the effect that any enemy ships South of Latitude 35046&apos; North might be assumed te be enemy transports orauxiliaries and sunk at sight.The Y&quot;ar Cabinet were also informed that information had been received that the Italians had started to evacuate Benghazi,    There might thereforebe vessels leaving that port having women and childrenon board.The War Cabinet:-Approved the proposal that enemy shipsSouth of Latitude 35c 46&apos; North shouldbe assumed to be enemy transports orauxiliaries and sunk at sight, subjectto further consideration being givento the question whether ships outward bound from Benghazi, which might havewomen and children on board,  should betreated in this way,(NOTE:    After the Meeting, the First Lord and First SeaLtvrd considered the matter.    Bearing in mind that,under existing instructions of which the italians had had warning, all ships within 30 miles of the libyan Coast were liable to be sunk at sight;    andthat if the Italians were evacuating women andchildren from Benghazi, it was quite likely thatthey were doing so by motor transport to Tripoli(but that presumably there was no intention ofdebarring our Air Force from attacking motor transport on the Benghazi-Tripoli road) they proposed that no distinction should be made betweenships steering toward or away from Benghazi,    ThePrime Minister concurred in this view and authorised the despatch of a telegram to the effect that, southof Latitude 35046* North,    every merchant ship mightuntil further orders, be assumed to be amilitary transport er auxiliary, and sunk at &amp;igh4^7Tf.*t George Street, S,W, 1,
