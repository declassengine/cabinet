THE BALKANSD THEIIDDLE EAST.Fisit of theSecretary ofState forForeign affairs and the C.I.G.S.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and the Chief of the.Imperial General Staff had now arrived at Cairo ontheir way to Athens and Angora.     The object ofthis visit was to see what help could be given tothe Greeks and the Turks in the event of a german advance south through Bulgaria and to ascertain how the diplomatic situation in that part of the worldcould be made to conform to the military;    and whatthe prospects were of inducing Yugo-Slavia and turkey to take action.If the Greeks decided to oppose a german advance into their country, we should have to help them to the full extent of our power and Mr. Edenwould inform them of what help we could give. Itmight well be that a German thrust toward Salonikawould be irresistible; but if the Greeks.decided tofight, we should do what we could* It waspossible, of course, that before making their advance the Germans would offer the Greeks such attractiveterms that they would feel bound to make peace.     Inthat ease we could not very well blame them, nor should we take such a decision on the part of the greeks too tragically.       We should have done our duty and should then have to content ourselves by making our position in the Greek Islands as strongas possible.     From these Islands we could wage airwar against Germany, which might eventually turn inour favour.The Prime Minister, continuing, said that .the first phase of our air reinforcement   of Egyptwas a highly economical one.     Our pilots in theMiddle East, an extremely experienced body of men,were now being remounted with the best machines.Should we have to face the fact that Greece was inthe enemy&apos;s hands and Turkey an honest neutral (thelatter being the least we could expect) it would remain for consideration what we should do with ourstrong forces now in the Delta.     In that event,the question of advancing into Tripoli would againarise.     He hoped we should not have to put any large part of our army into Greece.     In fact it was unlikely that it would be possible for a largeBritish force to get there before the Germans.The Prime Minister then read to the WarCabinet the instructions which had been issued to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs before his departure which were generally endorsed by the WarCabinet.Great George Street, S.W..1,(SgIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT.)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document. /MOST    SECRET.
