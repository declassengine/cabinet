/BOOUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S GOVERNMENT. )TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.MOST   SECRET.It is requested that special care may be taken toansuce the sserecy of this document.COPY NOWoM.(4l) 2QTH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.(24th February, 1941 - 5.0 p.m.)EE BALKANSAMD THEMIDDLE EAST.FutureMilitaryPolicy.(previous reference:W.M.(41) 19thConclusions,Minute 1.)The War Cabinet had before them thefollowing documents:-(a) Telegrams received from the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff (W.P.(41) 38).(b) A Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P.(4l) 39(Revise)).(c) Telegrams, dated 11th February, 1941, (l) fromthe Prime Minister to General Wavell and (2)from, the. Chiefs of Staff to, the ^Commander s-:!;B.-ruhiex, Middle East, and.the Commander-in-ij.&apos;i:ief, Mediterranean (W.P,(41) 40),THE PRIME MINISTER said that the WarCabinet had to reach a most important decision, namely,whether to open a new theatre of war in Greece.Among the telegrams contained in W.P.(41) 38 hewould draw particular attention to one from himself to Mp. Eden, in which he said that if it wasconsidered that the Greek enterprise would only be another Norwegian fiasco he should say so.       Inspite of this telegram the Foreign Secretary, theChief of the Imperial General Staff and general wavell had recommended that we should send armed forces to Greece to help the Greeks meet a german advance through Bulgaria.       The telegrams received on the question were impressive.     General Wavellwas in favour of the operation, although he was inclined to understatement, and so far had alwayspromised less then he had performed, and was a man who wished to be better than his word.     He (thePrime Minister) could imagine that General Wavell&apos;first wish would be to complete the successfulcampaign in North East Africa, and clear    theItalians entirely from that part of the worlds   general wavell&apos;s opinion therefore in favour of action in greece must have considerable weight. .   The Chiefof the Imperial General Staff had, he thought, alwaysdoubted whether Germany could be successfully resisted on the mainland, and had always taken arestrained -view about our going into Greece.     He had now sent a remarkable telegram to the Vice Chief of

the Imperial General Staff saying that he consideredby sending our forces to Greece we had a reasonable chance of resisting a German advance.     Further theChiefs of Staff had reported that, on balance, they considered that the enterprise should go forward.The Prime Minister added that, pending a decision ofthe Cabinet, he had given instructions for pre-reparations for the operation to proceed.     He, himself,was in favour of going to the rescue of Greece, oneof the results of which might be to bring in turkey and Yugoslavia, and to force the Germans to bringmore troops from Germany.     The reaction of the UnitedStates would also be favourable.On the other hand, the difficulties ofmaintaining an army on Iar.d must not be under-rated,for it would have to be supplied by ships going round the Cape of Good Hope.     He felt, however, that ifthe Greeks were to fight the Germans we must fightand suffer with them.      If any of his colleagues had misgivings about the enterprise they should express them now.MR. MENZIES said that before an Australianforce could be employed in a new theatre of war, hewould have to communicate with his colleagues.     Thequestion was clearly one of balancing risks, butthere were one or two points on which he would liketo be re-assured.      How long, for instance, would ittake to put our troops into Greece, in order to take up a defensive  position.     Could ou? shipping main-tain the strain of the operation?     He was also alittle uneasy regarding the equipment of the 7thAustralian Division which was to be employed in this theatre, and which was now in Palestine, and equippedon the training scale.     What were the prospects ofgiving full equipment to this Division?     If thesequestions could be answered favourably, it would removecertain doubts in the minds of his colleagues inAustralia.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not anticipate that the German advance would take placeuntil about the 12-15th   March, and our troops should arrive at their positions at about the same time*THE VICE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERALSTAFF said that the 7th Australian Division was fully equipped, except for divisional artillery and certainmotor transport,     He gave particulars of the numberof 25 pounders which had been despatched to Egypt,and he had no doubt that the deficiences would bemade good out of equipment already on the spot.     Itwas practically certain that General Blarney wouldhave been called into consultation on this question.He thought that Mr. Menzies could rest assured thatno Australian Division would baput into line withouta full establishment of the necessary weapons.

THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF, in answer to aquestion as to our air position in Greece, said thatat the moment we had 7 squadrons in the country, but the Air Officer Commanding hoped to raise this number to 14, and possibly 16, during March,,      In his opinionGermany would take some little time to develop thefull weight of   her   air effort from Bulgaria.,      Thetotal strength of the German Air Force in Roumania was between 400-450 machines, but 120 of these were co-operational aircrafto     We should have about 250machineSoMR, MENZIES at;ked whether if the enterprisefailed,  the price of failure would be confined tothe loss of the equipment of an armoured division,THE PRIMS MINISTER said that if we should be pressed back, our troops might well have to be evacuated;   but that we ought to be able to evacuatesafely all but the wounded,MR. MENZIES said that the justification forthe enterprise rested on the prospect of our being ableto put up a good fighto      If the enterprise was onlya forlorn hope., it had better not be undertaken,Could he say to his colleagues in Australia that theventure had a substantial chance of success?THE PRIME MINISTER said that in the last resort this was a question which the Australian cabinet must assess for themselves on Mr, Menzies &apos; advice.,    Inhis (the Prime Minister&apos;s) opinion, the enterprise wasa risk which we must undertake.     At the worst hethought that the bulk of the men could be got back to egypt, where new equipment could by then be provided.The war turned in his opinion on our -(l) holding England(2^ holding Egypt(3) retaining command of the sea(4) obtaining command of the air and(5) being able to keep open the AmericanarsenalSoThe enterprise in Greece was an advanceposition which we could try to hold, without jeopardisingour main position,THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FORFOREIGN AFFAIRS was asked whether, if we sent help to greece,    the chances of Turkey or Yugoslavia entering the war on our side would be increased.     He thoughtthat Turkey would probably again raise the question ofsupplies for herself9 but that she would be more 3,:lk&quot;&quot;;7to come into the war if this enterprise was undertaken.The Yugoslavian position was obscure and he did not puthigh the prcspects of her &quot;making a stand against Germany.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the courageof the Serb race must not be forgotton.    the yugoslav Government was trembling, but the effectof our helping the Greeks might stiffen the resistance of the Balkan peoples to german aggression.It was recalled that Colonel Donovanhad stressed in a telegram to the President theimportance of the formation of a Balkan front.    Ifwe now forsook Greece it would have a bad effect in the United States.Mention was also made of the effect ofour action on Russia and of  a    suggestion thatthe Foreign Secretary should see Stalin.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had telegraphed to Mr. Eden saying that he did notthink he should see Stalin unless he received avery positive  invitation to do so.    The positionof Russia was not an enviable one, Germany was now on the Black Sea at Constanza, where she would soon have a flotilla and she would be in aposition to obtain oil from Baku and Batoum,   Hethought the Russian attitude was one of makingconcessions to Germany in order to gain time.THE MINISTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTIONthought that the enterprise would involve aserious strain on our shipping, particularly if it should prove necessary to withdraw our forces from Greece, in which event the enterprise would,he thought, go a long way towards reducingessential imports to this country.    He thoughtthat the effect of the enterprise on our shipping resources should be closely examined,THE PRIME MINISTER then invited all theMinisters present to express their views.The views expressed were, v/ithoutexception, in favour of sending military assistanceto Greece,

The War Cabinet:(l) Authorised the Prime Minister tosend a telegram to the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs tothe effect that, subject to (2) and(4) below, the War Cabinet approved the despatch of military assistanceto Greece, on the basis of thescheme outlined in the telegrams from the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,,(2)    Took note that, before an Australianforce could be employed in a newtheatre of war, Mre Menzies wouldhave to communicate with hiscolleagues in Australia, and invited him to make the necessarycommunication,,(3)    In this connection invited theSecretary of State for War to confirm that the equipment of the7th Australian Division would becompleted in all essentials to fullscale before proceeding to Greece,(4)   In-lteC- the Se^retasy of State forDominion Affairs to communicate with the Government of New zealand in regard to the employment of theNew Zealand Division in Greece,(5)   Took note that the Prime minister would inform the President of theUnited States of the decision in(l) above, at the appropriate moment,,Great George Street, S,,W,.1P
