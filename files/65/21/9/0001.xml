S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.&apos;)   32MOST SECRET.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY,it is requested that special care may betaken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NO.W.M.(41) 21ST conclusions MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(27th February, 1941 - 5.30 p.m.)&apos;processes BALKANS;SD THEiilDDLE EAST.Futureuilitarypolicy,,(previous reference:17.M.(4l) 20thConclusions,Minute 4, )A further discussion took place on the decisionto despatch military assistance to Greece.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he felt nodoubt that the decision taken at the last Meeting hadbeen right.    It had been taken in full knowledge ofthe many difficulties which would attend the openingof a new theatre of war in Greece, e. g:-(a) The necessity for supplying our forces by the long route round the Cape.(b) The heavy attacks now being made on our &quot;shippings(c) The danger of the Suez Canal being blockedby enemy action.On the other hand it had previously beenour intention to maintain in the Middle East a largerforce than we now contemplated sending to Greece.    Theslightly longer voyage to Greece was not in itself a formidable addition to our difficulties.MR. MENZIES informed the War Cabinet that hehad received the Commonwealth Government&apos;s reply/tothe telegram which he had sent after the last meetingof the Cabinet.    His colleagues had appreciated theneed for an immediate decision and concurred in theproposed use of two Australian divisions in the forcesinitially contemplated for the Greek campaign.    Theyhad made it plain that, had more time been available,they would have sought advice on the following aspectsof the plan:-(a) The small size of the force proposed,relative to the task before it.    Would it not be possible to provide additionalnumbers, and also to augment them asequipment became available?(b) They could not agree to Australian troopstaking part in the campaign, unless theywere equipped on the maximum establishmentscale.(c) Their consent to the participation of australian forces was conditional on planshaving been completed beforehand to ensurethat evacuation (if it should become necessary) could be successfully undertaken.Shipping and other essential services mustbe available for this purpose.

. The Commonwealth Government desired thatthe fullest consideration should he given to these points.Mr. Menzies recalled that the Chief of theImperial General Staff had been satisfied that theforces to be initially despatched to Greece were of adequate size.     He intended to point this out tohis colleagues in Australia.THE DOMINIONS SECRETARY said that the NewZealand Government had also telegraphedTconcurringin the course proposed, on the understanding thatthe New Zealand division would be fully equippedbefore leaving, and that it would be accompanied byan armoured brigade.     In a separate telegram, however,the New Zealand Government had asked for an assurance that the force proposed was, in fact, considered tobe adequate for the hazardous operation to bo under-taken.     They also asked what arrangements werebeing made for providing support for the australian and New Zealand forces, after operations had begun?MR. MENZIES said that the Governments ofthe Commonwealth of Australia and of New Zealand hadboth of them accepted the large political arguments -in favour of the despatch of military assistance to greece.     It should be appreciated, however, thatit was proposed to send to Greece two of the fourAustralian Divisions, and   the one New Zealand division.     The issues involved were, therefore, of outstanding importance to both Australia and NewZealand.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was deeplymoved by the messages from the Commonwealth and NewZealand Governments.      They had responded magnificentlyto what was, perhaps, the most severe proposalever put before Dominion Governments.     It was quite natural that they should make the points raised which in no way detracted from the value oftheir response.       Answers should be sent to thepoints raised by the Governments of Australia andNew Zealand.The political value of military steps now decided upon, must not be ignored.      Thus:-(a)    The course adopted was the policy best calculated to retain the military co-operation-operation not only of the 18 GreekDivisions now in the fieldy but also tosecure the 27 Turkish Divisions now in thrace.      Those forces, together with ourown would be larger than any which theGermans could put into the field against us for several months.

M(b) We must not dismiss the possibility of Yugoslaviacoming in on our side,(c) We should hope to be able to send considerablereinforcements.    The 6th Division wouldprobably be available in about 2 months1 time.,while it might be possible to send the 50thDivision to Greece from the United KingdomsA considerable Empire force (including theSouth African Division) was now engaged in east Africa and might be available to proceednorth after the Italian position had beenliquidated.A 2nd Division had been promised from SouthAfrica.    The Foreign Secretary and the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff were to meetGeneral Smuts in Egypt,,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had not yet received General Wavell&apos;s report on the date by whichthe Divisions from the Middle East could take the fieldin Greece.In order to limit the number of people inthe secret, the new plan had not yet been communicatedto the Canadian and Union Governments.    For the same reason, President Roosevelt had not yet been informed.Probably the right moment for taking them into our confidence would be when we had seen General Wavell^s time table.It would be aniDStako   to draw any pessimisticinferences from the recent encounter between Britishand German armoured fighting vehicles in Libya.    TheGerman force had been driven back;    there were no indications that the Germans were preparing to attemptthe considerable operation of an advance across   the libyan Desert. It wasnot known how many German mechanisedformations had been ferried over to Libya.The War C ab ine t:-(l) Expressed their high appreciation ofthe answers sent by the Government ofthe Commohweal8i of Australia and theGovernment of New Zealand,(2) Invited the Secretary of State for war to furnish Mr. Menzies with any further particulars he might require in preparing the reply to the telegram dated 26th February from the commonwealth government,(3) Invited the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, in consultation withthe Chiefs of Staff, to prepare (for submission to the Prime Minister) a replyto the telegrams dated 26th February fromthe Government of New Zealand.Great George Street, S,W. 1.*&quot;3t

Begins.Cabinet 24th February considered whole middle east position.    Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,with Chief of the Imperial General Staff, held exhaustivediscussions at Cairo with Wavell, Cunningham and. Longmoreand following is summary of Conclusions which they reachedthere:-(a) We should do everything in our power to bring thefullest measure of help to Greeks at earliest possible moment.If the help that we are in a position to offer were accepted,they believed that there was a fair chance of halting aGerman advance and preventing Greece from being overrun.(b) Maximum land forces which could be sent: three divisions and the Polish Brigade and most of one armoured division with certain specialised troops.(c) As regards the air, maximum increase of existingseven British Squadrons in Greece:    three bomber, one army co-operation, one long-range bomber and probably two fighter,making total of fourteen Squadrons in all.(d) Command of British forces to be entrusted toGeneral Maitland-Wilson.(e) Should they agree to proposal Greeks to be urged to accept above forces as soon as they can be despatched inview of time factor.From Cairo Eden and Dill with Wavell proceeded to athens where after discussion with Greek representativesthey reported as follows:-Greek representatives had accepted offer and werein full agreement on following points:-(a)-   Movement of British troops should begin forthwithutmost secrecy being preserved.(b) Wilson should be under immediate authority of greek Commander-in-Chief with right to refer in case of necessity to Commander-in-Chief, Middle East.(c-)   Greeks immediately should begin preparations towithdraw advance troops from Bulgarian frontier to line in macedonia which in event of Yugoslav refusal to join us againsGermany would have to be held initially and to improvecommunications to facilitate^occupation of that line.

(d) Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shouldmake further effort to persuade Yugoslav Government tojoin us.(e) Effort should he made to persuade TurkishGovernment to re-affirrn its assurance that it would comeinto the War if Greece were invaded or better still ifGerman formations openly entered Bulgaria.Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also reported that he Dill and Wavell were all impressed byfrankness and fair dealing of Greek authorities on allsubjects discussed and by their clear determination to resist to utmost of strength.In considering above recommendations Cabinet,taking into account fact that our advisers at present inthe Middle East, including as they do the Chief of theImperial General Staff and Wavell, represent the mostprudent and experienced military opinion at our disposal,reached conclusion that recommendations should beaccepted and should be acted upon immediately.We have not failed to take full cognisance ofrisks involved in despatch to Greece and maintenance thereof so large a proportion of troops available in middle east.    On other hand we are satisfied that above force shouldifee able to reach positions in Greece in time to meetGerman advance and that the plan offers a reasonable prospect of achieving its objects.    It was felt that wemust take this only remaining chance of forming Balkanfront and persuading Turkey and possibly Yugoslavia toenter war on our side.    From strategic point of view,formation of Balkan front would have advantages of makingGermany fight at end of long line of communication andexpending her resources uneconomically, of interfering with Germany&apos;s trade with Balkans and particularly oiltraffic from Roumania and of enabling us to establishplatform for bombing of Italy and Roumanian oil fields.Further it would keep war going in Albania and preventItaly from devoting her energies to re-establishing her position in North Africa.    Moreover, if we failed tosupport Greece Germany would obtain naval and air basesfrom which to threaten our position in eastern mediterranean including Crete and Suez Canal and interferewith our communications to Turk^r,  and v/ould become free to concentrate on Turkey and to run oil traffic fromBlack Sea to Adriatic.      Finally, from political pointof view failure to help this small nation putting up agallant fight against one aggressor and willing to defyanother would have grave effect on public opinion throughout the world and particularly in United States.Ends
