L US IONS. MINUTE confidential Annex(13th April, 1943,  12.15 p.m0)THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he did not propose to mention questions like Shipping, which hadbeen dealt with separately, hut to confine himself to political issues.2.     Perhaps the political topic most frequentlydiscussed in the United States concerned the relationsbetween the United States and Russia.    &apos; The foreign secretary thought that the President was not happy withthe diplomatic side of the picture.     Litvinoff was aman of less influence than, and was not so much in theconfidence of his Government as, Maisky.     Further,the President was not altogether satisfied with United-&apos;States representation in Moscow.      He thought that thePresident had it in mind to send Mr. Davis back to moscow when his health was sufficiently recovered.3.     The Foreign Secretary said that he thought theUnited States Administration made a mistake in notgiving the Russians as much information about daily -diplomatic events as we did.     For example, we had always told the Russians about any tentative peacefeelers.     He had suggested that the State Departmentmight authorise their Ambassador in Moscow to give theRussians a full account of his (the Foreign Secretary&apos;s]talks, as a start in this direction.4-a     The Foreign Secretary thought that the publicattitude towards Russia was,  on the whole, lessfriendly in the United States than it was in thiscountry.     Many people felt that Russia&apos;s attitudeafter the war was unpredictable.     There was, hov/ever,general support for the view that no harm could come tothe United States from endeavouring to come to terms with the TJ.S.S.R.     Among those who would probably not endorse   this view was Mr. Hoover.     The latterwanted closer relations between the United States and ourselves., but the Foreign Secretary suspected that&apos;- thtewag because he regarded this as preferable to eloserrelations between the United Statos and Russia.5.     The President had asked the Foreign Secretarywhether the latter thought that Russia would want toCommunise all Iihirope after the war.     The Foreign.Secretary had replied that he did not think so, andthat he thought one of the best ways of avoiding thiswas that we should, do what we could to keep on goodterms with Russia.

6.     The President seemed to have reconciled himself toRussia retaining the Baltic States after the war.     his view was that he did not &quot;seo who was going to turn - her out.The President, however, was keen on plebiscites,, andmight suggest their employment in connection with these states.7,     The President thought that if Poland absorbed east prussia and received compensation in Silesia, she oughtto be satisfied with the Curson Line as the boundary withRussia, more especially since much of Eastern Poland which she would thereby 1dso was largely peopled by Ukranians,The President thought that one way of handling the matter would be that this country, the United States and russia should settle between themselves what they regarded as fairterms as between Russia and Poland, and that we should thenunite   in persuading the Poles to accept this settlementsThe President thought that this would be much better than a prolonged I3olish-Rtissian wrangle^8.     The President had not shown himself anxious about the positions     He thought that the Russian terms were reasonable.,Mr. Welles, on the other hand, was somewhat apprehensive, onthe ground that the Mutual Assistance Pact which theRussians wanted with Finland might mean something in thenature of a Protectorate.9.     There had ?jeen much talk about France, of a somewhatvaried nature,     Mr. Hull clearly hated General de Gaulle.The Foreign Secretary had heard a good deal of the complaint that wo had not done enough to defend the American point of view.For the most part, however, discussion had related to thefuture handling of the Froncho     On this it seemed that therewas one point of difference between the United States and ourselves,.     The Unitod States did not want to see theestablishment at this stage of a single French authority,even if that authority was not recognised as a national government.     The Foreign Secretary had made it clear that weshould greatly prefer to deal with one authority, although weshould-not.perhaps regard that authority as a national government in quite the same sense, as the other national governments which had come out of Europe when their territories were overrun.     The United States preferred to dealwith individuals^ and were willing to see Giraud and de gaulle separate.     They also wished to deal separately withthe French authorities in the Pacific islands and inMartinique.      The Foreign Secretary said that he wondered whether this was in part attributable to the United Statesdesire to see some of the French islands in the Pacificint e rnat i onalised.10.   In the course of the conversations the President had referred to previous suggestions that Indo-China, Dakar andBizerta should be internationalisedo     Mr. Welles hadreminded him that ho was committed, by public declarations,to a policy of restoring the full integrity of the French Empire.    . It seemed unlikely that these particular suggestionswould bo further pursued.11.   If the Allied forces landed in France,  the UnitedStates did n t want the Allied forces to be accompaniedby any French civil authority.      They thought that theterritory liberated by the Allies should be administered bythe Allies.     The Foreign Secretary had said that, while hehad not consulted the War Cabinet on this point, he thoughtthat our view was different, and that we should want to have some French civil authority working with the Allied militaryauthorities from an early stage.

The Foreign Secretary said that those had not worked out very happily in North Africa. -   The reason was perhaps that the State Department had much less close contact with the Services than the Foreign Office had inthis country with the Chiefs of Staff.      Or, perhaps itwas more accurate to say that the State Department1scontacts wore with the political heads of the service departments, but not with the United States Chiefs ofStaff,at ion inthat thestaff ofLlrv  Hull was clearly anxious for better collabor-the future than in the past.     He had suggestedForeign Office might attach one &quot;of its number to thethe Combined Chiefs of Stafff and that the state department should do the same-     This would help to bringabout bettor eo-ordination0    This was a matter for considbra-that the difficulty lay mainlytloru It was clear2 however,in the faulty iimencan set-up.13.him thisolatmade bSecretthat twhichin hisresoluincroiavo idwhichthe laThe President, Mr. Hull and Mr. Welles had all toldat United States opinion was trending away fromion.     This was amply borne out by the statementsy the many Senators and Congressmen whom the Foreignary had met.     Mr. Welles had said that he hopedhe Senate would, in a month or so, pass a resolutionwould give the President a good deal more latitudeforeign .policy.     He hoped that, by a series oftions being passed, the President would be givensing support for his policy, and that this would the gulf between the executive and the Legislature-had existed in President Wilson&apos;s case at the end of st war.14.   The Foreign Secretary said that on the last night ofhis visit he had had dinner with Mr.  Hull, and two leadingSenators had shown him the draft of a resolution whichthey had it in mind to table, giving the&apos;President far moreliberty of action and had even consulted him about its termss15*   The Foreign Secretary said that if the United states were to co-operate in some form of world organisation, itcould only be on the basis of an authority with a world-wide basis which would have to include China.     ^/Thereasons for this wore,  first, that the United States .hated Japan far more then they hated the Germans.Secondly, that they feared that China might collapse intochaos , and wished to give the Generalissimo authority.Thirdly, that they probably regarded China aacounterpoise against Russia in the Far East^/16.   The President thought that the elaboration of world-wide organisation could not be worked outourselves and the United States alone, but that representatives of other nations must beall stages.      It was perhaps for this repossible)etweenPresident wccone ept ion v.brought in at.son that thevnxiousheto stres;sible.th e Un it e d Na t i ons17.  The sortPresident heof world-wide organisation which thein mind was as follows.      The basis would bea General assembly not unlike the Assembly of the Leagueof Nations.      Next, there would be an Advisory Council,comprising representatives of the three Great Powers and china, and also six or eight other representatives chosen by the other countries.     Thirdly, the President hopedthat the Advisory Council would be prepared to entrust

pretty wide powers .to an Executive consisting of- the three great Powers mid China.      He also proposed that thereshould be an officer, to be called the Moderator, whowould have powers not unlike those of the Secretary-General of the League, and who would be authorisedto   convoke   the Advisory Council and the Executivewhenever matters arose which called for consultation.&apos; 18,   Ais regards the Council of Europe, the Presidentthought that it would be impossible for the United states to belong to it,   I.:?, Welles thought that it might be ineffect a council suoordinate to the main body,,   as such itmight deal with economic mattersp communications and health, but not with political issues^19.   The Foreign Secretary said that he saw little in thislay-out in which our ideas differed from those of thePresident, except as regards the extent of the powers which it was hoped might be entrusted to the Executive ofthe throe Great Powers and Chinas20.   The President had referred to a suggestion which hehad&apos;made earlier (in discussion with the Prime Minister),that after the war only the four Great Powers would retainnational armed forces.      He had, however, been reminded that,  even if it,were possible to impose such terms on enemy countries,  it would hardly be practicable todis-arm neutral countries; . and it seemed unlikely thatthis suggestion would be seriously pressed.21,    In discussion it was emphasised that in most ..European countries compulsory military service was anessential feature of the national life;    and it was difficult to believe that,  in the years immediately following the war, any French or Polish Government couldbe brought to dispense with national forces.      The only practical way of weaning Europe from the-maintenance of excessive national forces would be through the establish-ment of world machinery for the settlement of international disputes, on the linos of the Advisory Council mentionedabove, which would have at its disposal internationalforces capable of enforcing its decisions.      The route tothis goal would be to persuade each country to earmark a portion of its national forces which would be available toserve at the request of the Council as part of an inter-national force.      It might be desirable that, as a first step towards this objective, the Armies of Occupation afterthe war should be built up on this basis.2g.   The Foreign Secretary, continuing, said that a gooddeal of thought had been given in Washington to the futuretreatment of Germany.     Mr.  Suimier Welles was a keenadvocate of dismemberment&apos;;.   and the President himselfappeared to favour this view.      Mr. Hull had not finallymade up his mind on this point,  and it could not be saidthat&apos; the state Department unanimously favoured dismember-raent.2.3.   Mr. Welles&apos; view was that Germany should eventually be divided into a number of independent States - e.g.Bavaria, a smaller Prussia, Saxony and North-western germany.     Austria should at first remain separate, but might subsequently link up with Bavaria.    The Ruhr should remain under international supervision for some years after

*   4 -m   ithe war..-    It was a part of his plan that, for thepurposes of our military occupation of Germany intnedi ately-after the war, we should make military divisions  (with separate Coianands etc,-, )* corresponding broadly to the areasof the separate States into which we hoped the GreaterGermany would eventually be broken up.o      The foreign secretary said that,  in his view,  this last point was anew and valuable centributicru-24,    In discussion, the view was expressed that, while thetendency of the German-speaking peoples to preserve theirunity would be strong,  it might well be practicable in course of time to promote,  and cement different nationalgroupings in Central Europet      A start might be made witha Federation of States grouped round Vienna.     There were good reasons - racial, political and economic - whyBavaria should be linked with Austria rather than with northern Germany;    and this movement might be acceleratedby prescribing somewhat easier conditions for GermanStates which adhered to Vienna rather than Berlin.      Ifsuch a Confederation of the Danube proved practicable,  itmight be desirable that some part of Yugoslavia should bejoined v/ith it,  to provide access to the sea;    and,  if so,the present frontier of Yugoslavia might be extended toinclude Trieste.-25*    It was also suggested, that it would be helpful inpreserving&apos;European peace if more.emphasis were laid onthe building up of inter-State commerce and communications,so&apos; that common commercial interests would run across thelines of the political frontlors.26.   The Foreign Secretary said that the President&apos;policy in relation to the Far East was &quot;Japan for theJapanese&apos;&apos;&quot;o      He contemplated that Llanohukuo and Formosashould be restored to China:    that the Japan- se MandatedIslands should be internationalised:    that Korea should bean independent republic,  after an initial period under international tutelage:    and that Sakhalin should be restored to Russia..27a   In this connection the Foreign Secretary added that hehad been assured by the Chinese Ambassador at Washingtonthat China had no ambitions in respect of Slain, Indo-China,Burma or Malaya.28.   During these conversations the President had notevinced any desire for new American bases in the Pacific.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was no reason why any difficulty should arise between ourselves and the UnitedStates on this guest.ion.      War between this country andthe United. States was unth3.nkab.le;    and it was therefore a major British interest that the United States should secure full mobility of their sea and air power throughoutthe Pacific.      It should be the basis of our policy.thatwe would not object to any American proposals to acquirefurther bases in this area.... ; a a v. &apos;:\ - A\--AA-..  ;     :,:-Aa fi AAAa &apos;- - - A      .-----A-A.;;- . -. a &apos;-- -:l A&apos;..

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that,  though certaincommercial interests in the United States had decidedambitions in this field,  the United States Administration .had not yet cleared their minds about the future of civilaviation after the war.      In these circumstances he had

reached an understanding with the President that HoM.Government and the United States Government would continueto study this question independently, on the basis that each would let the other know as soon as it was ready toenter upon joint discussions.     Meanwhile, each Government-would do its best to discourage public discussion whichmight have the effect of crystallising public opinion in either country prematurely on these issues.-30.

Such an arrangement, while- avoidingdualism in the executive decisions taken on the spot, would allow of decisions of major policy being taken as usual byagreement between the two Governments,For the present this proposal had been put forward on grounds of administrative convenience.
