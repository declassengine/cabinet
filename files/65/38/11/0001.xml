TO Bit is re.- &apos;^^I^LOCK AND KEY.W  MOST secret copy NO,W.M., ,(.45)  82ND CONCLUSIONS f MINUTE confidential Annex(7th June, 1943, s0SO p.m. )TUNISIAGeneralAlexanderT sStatement.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he and all hiscolleagues felt the greatest admiration for GeneralAlexanderfs military achievements, and were very-pleased to have him among them that afternoon.The operations in Tunisia were, however, only a prelude to heavy work ahead.    In all amphibiousoperations tho accidents of weather conditionsintroduced an element of the incalculable.   during his visit to North Africa :tho previous week he had,however, been greatly cheered by the opinions ofthose who would have to carry out this further task,They wore all full of confidence that the operation would meet with success.The Prime Minister then asked general alexander to give an account of the recent fighting in Tunisia and to say something about the plans of future operations.GENERAL ALEXANDER said that when he had boonsummoned, in february last, to take charge of operations in Tunisia, the situation had not been by any means favourable.   The Germans had beenattacking, and with some success.   The first needhad been to stabilise the front and to separatetho British, United States and French forces into their component parts.   Tho second stage had been to regain the initiative and to plan how to turn the Axis forces out of North Africa.   For this latter task the first essential had been to getthe Eighth Army through the Mareth gap and into contact with the First Army, in order to bringsuperiority to boar against the enemy.   When this had been done, tho next step was to drive tho Axisforces back within the smallest possible perimeter.Our air forces wore greatly superior to those ofthe enemy, and it was desirable to develop their strength to the fullest possible extent.   For thispurpose, however, it was necessary to get possessionof the airfields in the coastal strip South of tunis.   By making use of our air superiority wocould give our Navy fighter cover by day and thusenable out Naval forces to cut the enemy&apos;s seacomi viunica t i ens *To help the Eighth Army through tho Gabcsgap ho had ordered the United States Second Corpsto Gafsa and to Maknassy.   This had served twopurposes.    In the first place, dumps of petrolhad&quot;boon accumulated at Gafsa to ease the Eighth

Army s supply position, since thoy were relying onvory long linos of comrnunicationc    In the second place,  they would draw off the onomy reserves fromopposite the Eighth army    In this they succeeded,but they could not quite accomplish the extra task which he had set them, namely, of cutting offcompletely Rommel&apos;s forces, which were resistingthe Eighth Army&apos;s passage through the Gabos gapcAs soon as the Eighth ^,rmy had got throughthe Gabos gap thoy moved up very quickly to theEnfidaville position, thus forcing the enemy backto a relatively small perimeter covering Bizcrtaand Tunis.    This perimeter, however, which was 120miles long, was too large for the enemy to holdas a permanent defensive position.   He thought thatGeneral von Arnim had made a mistake in notshortening his perimeter still further0Goneral Alexander added that the enemy forcescomprised some 15 Divisions, although most of thesewore weak and under strength, opposed to 17 allied divisions.    But the Allied air superiority had beenvery groateGoncral Alexander said that ho had next had todecide at what point on the perimeter the attackshould be made.    Both in the North and in the Souththere was   very difficult country, not at allsuitable for tanks0    The obvious line of attack was on the plain stretching Westwards from Tunis0This, however, had scorned to-him too obvious a place for attack, and ho had therefore decided to launchhis first attack somewhat to the South of thecentral plain.    If this attack had been completelysuccessful, ho had intended to force a break-throughin this sector.    But., although it had gone welland much ground had been gained, it had not gonequite fast enough to achieve a complete break-through.   He had therefore decided to detach fromthe Eighth Army the Fourth Indian Division and the seventh Armoured Division, which ho had concentratedwith other forces behind Medjoz-el-Bab0In the meantime, the United States SecondCorps had been moved up to the coastal sector inthe North, end had been given Bizerta as their objective.    They had fought very well in this sector and had captured Bizerta almost at thesame time as Tunis had boon captured.Returning to the central sector, the attackhere had been concentrated on the smallestpossible front, and a groat weight of artillery,tanks, and the full power of the Air Force hadbeen employed.    The infantry had attacked by night and had gained their first and second objectives.The Germans had fought well, but as daylight camewhile our attack on the second objective was still in progress they had scon two divisions of tanks following up the infantry.   This had proved too much for their moralej    they had brokenand run, and had not stopped until thoy had reachedTunis.    36 hours had elapsed from the time of thefirst attack on Mcdjoz-ol-Bab until our troops had entered Tunis, a distanco of 30 miles.    General vonArnim had been taken prisoner by the Fourth Indian-2&apos;

Divisions,,   He had spoken to him for a few&apos;minutesand had ascertained that his orders had been to stayand fight it out to the end and not to evacuate.   Thetotal number of Axis prisoners was 248,000 and only 632had escaped by sea.As soon as Tttnis had been captured, the 78thDivision had been sent up to occupy the town.    OtherDivisionshad turned northwards and southwards to complete the break-up of the enemy&apos;s forces.    This had quicklybeen achieved..General Alexander then turned to OperationHUSKY, and expressed himself as optimistic as tothe outcomes     Much, no doubt, would depend on the weather, but it should be good at this time of year.    It was estimated that there were some 9 ItalianDivisions in the Island, 4 mobile- and 5 second-class.In addition,- there was the equivalent of one GermanDj. vis ion a    So far there had been no signs of other Germanreinforcements.   The success of the Operation depended upon our ability to get our troops ashore in fightingtrim.    Once that had been done, he was very confident ofthe outcome-    Our troops were training hard and were,in terrific heart.   We had never had such a good army as we had today.   The HUSKY plan was a good one, andthe preparations were all going ahead welli   he therefore felt justified in his optimism as to the successof the Operation^THE PRIMS MINISTER said that General Alexander couldrest assured that he would be judged by the quality of performance rather than by the actual results.   Hehad shown himself undaunted by the gruelling ordealhe had undergone in Burma.    It was his conduct ofthose operations which had given Ministers suchconfidence in his leadership - a confidence which hadbeen fully borne out.The Cabinet were most grateful to him for thestatement which he had given to them, which would always remain in their memories*Offices of the War Cabinet, S.Wil.
