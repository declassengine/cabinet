(43)28thConclusions,Minute 4)W.M.(43)  75TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1,Confidential Annex.(23rd May,  1943 -    9.0 p.m.)The War Cabinet met to consider three telegrams from thePrime Minister (PENCIL Nos. 166, 167 and 18l) about relationsbetween General de Gaulle and General Giraud,In PENCIL 166 tho Prime Minister had reported that a verystern situation was developing about General de Gaulle-,   Hothought that urgent consideration should-be given to thequestion whether General de Gaulle should not now be eliminatedas a political force, tho French National Committee being told that we would havo no further relations with them, nor give them any money, so long as de Gaulle was connected with them.PENCIL 167 contained a series of memoranda handed by thePresident to the Prime Minister, making various allegationsagainst General de Gaulle and the Fronch National Committee.PENCIL 181 contained a further expression of the PrimeMinister&apos;s views.The War Cabinet were Informed of the present position asto the negotiations between General de Gaulle and general giraud&apos;s,    .General dc Gaulle had been invited by General Giraud -to visit Algiers, subject to two conditions which it seemed probable that he would accept.     General Catroux had returnedto this country on the 21st May with a letter from general giraud&apos;s and supplementary explanations.     It was thought thatGeneral dc Gaulle would shortly apply for transport facilities to go to Algiers to conclude an agreement.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that this was  .confirmed by information reaching him that certain influentialmembers of the French National Committee had decided that general de Gaulle and General Giraud . hunt   now conclude an agreements the Wardifficult to cabinet took the view that it was extremelysee how wo could break with General de Gaulle atthe moment when he was on the point of reaching agreement withGeneral Giraud.     If General do Gaulle made trouble after &quot;anagreement&apos;had been roached wo should be in a stronger positionto insist upon his withdrawal, should this later prove necessary the War Cabinet wore given information as to a number of   -specific matters which would have to be takon into consideration before a decision could bo reached to break with General de gaulle?    o,g. -(a) There were 80,000 Fighting French troops in different parts of tho world.     We should experience particulartrouble in Fronch Equatorial Africa (where the troops were virulently de Gaullist), and also in Syria and north Palestine, if we were now to break v/ith theGeneral.

(b) TIE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that there were 47French Officers and 6^000 other ranks of the fighting french Navy&apos;, which manned 4 efficient submarines, 15H destroyers, corvettes and sloopsj    in all, 57 ships.The view of the Admiralty was that a break with general de   Gaulle would certainly cause some temporarydifficulties and inconvenience,:(c) Particulars wore given of the difficulties which had arisen as the result of members of the crows in North0, African French ships wishing to join General de Gaulle0The number of cases in which difficulty had arison wasv:.;ry small.     The point was not of special importance.(d) THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE informed the War Cabinet that opinion among French trade unionists showed considerable fear of growing UnitedStates influences     They did not altogether like Generaldo G-aulle himself, but the de Gaullist organisation waslooked upon as more likely than any other body to stimulate the resistance of the French working classes.(e) THE DEPUTY PRIME. MINISTER said that if we were to take action against General do Gaulle, many Fronchmen whowore now opposed to him would rally to him*     The nameof &quot;do   Gaulle&quot; was regarded as a symbol of theRepublic, and the do Gaullist movement stood for theEntente.(f)&apos; It was also pointed out that if we broke with general de Gaulle during or immediately after the PrimeMinister&apos;s visit to the United States, the inferencewould be drawn that we had done so under pressure fromthe United States.(g) It must be recognised that United States policy towardsthe French had not met with success, and there was increasing recognition of this fact in the UnitedStates itself.-     This was probably responsible forsome of the pressure which was now being exorcised infavour of getting rid of de Gaulle.(h) A break with de Gaulle at this moment might have an unfortunate effect on the Allied Governments rosidontin London raid depondent upon us for financial support and other facilitios*     Might this not create theimpression that these   Governments were within our power and could be broken at will?The effect on political opinion in this country shouldalso be borne in mind.The War Cabinet then considered three draft telegrams tothe Prime Minister which had been prepared in the Foreign, Of flee.-Various amendments wore agreed upon, to incorporate points made in discussion.The War Cabinet -g!* Approved the three drafit telegrams to the Prime^ Minister,&apos; as amendod, and authorised their despatch.36a Despatched as ALCOVE Nos, 370,371 and 372.Offices of tho War Cabinet, S.W.1.

It is disturbing that such a stream of Americanreports should have gone to Washington without the ambassador having spoken to the Foreign Secretary about them.   We had no idea that de Gaulle situation wasrankling so. much ,1!ist now.   We are fully conscious ofthe difficulties which de Gaulle has created for us, andof your position under heavy pressure from the Americans.We do not however consider that the policy which youso strongly recommend is practicable for the following reasons.2. The latest phase of the Giraud-de Gaullenegotiations indicates that union is nearer than it hasbeen at any time.   De Gaulle has been invited by Giraudto Algiers subject to the acceptance of two conditions and it seems probable that he will accept.   Catroux arrived on the 21st May with Giraud&apos;s letter and supplementaryoral explanations.   We anticipate an ear^&quot; applicationfrom de Gaulle for transport facilities.   It has beenthe policy of H.M.G. and the U.S.G. for the past four months.to.bring the two generals together and this ipolir;was blessed by the President and yourself at Anfa.   Ix,as we believe, itms,tbe right policy then, it is in ourview evert more the right policy now when both generalsappear to be on the point of achieving the union whichthey were then pressed to bring about.   Our information is;&quot;that the&apos; failure&apos;, of the two generals to reach agreement has caused disappointment in France.   There ismuch evidence that de Gaulle&apos;s personal position inFrance is- strong.   Vienot brought a message:from Herriot/ in which the

in which the latter says he regards de Gaulle as the on1.^&apos;leader, while the presence of Queuille, Massigli, Genoi-dxCochet and others shows that de Gaulle&apos;s supporters in France are not confined to the radical elements.Mr Macmillan reported on the 4th May that local opinion in Algiers was becoming more and more insistent on thoneed for immediate union and we. understand that the postponement of de Gaulle&apos;s proposed visit to Algiersat the beginning of April caused considerable excite-ment in North Africa and did not enhance Giraud!position.   He has also reported that the Frenchmen in tunisia were predominantly gaullist in the broadestsense.   Moreover the wider interest of France renderunion between the two bodies a necessity.   Whatprospects  would there be of union in France itselfafter the liberation if the Frenchmen outside France arenow incapable of reaching agreement between themselves ?3. We are advised that there is no livelihoodof any of the present members of the French national committee continuing to function if General de Gaullewere removed by us.   The same is probably true of theFree French F^htTng Forces.   The Oommittee will automatically diappear when union has been achievedbetween the two movements and de Gaulle should be morecontrollable by a committee of which he is only jointPresident, than he is in his present position.   New agrt:ments&apos;      would then have to be concluded between theU.S. and British Governments and the united French body,4. Is there not also a real danger that if we nowdrove de Gaulle out of public life at this moment when a union between the two French movements seems on thepoint of being achieved we would not only make him anational martyr but we would find ourselves accused &apos;by both gaullists and giraudists of interferingimproperly in French internal affairs with a view totreating France as an Anglo-American protectorate ?If so, our relations with France would be more danger-ously affected, than by a continuance of the present unsatisfactory situation,5. On the other hand we care equally with thePresident and Mr Hull alive to the unsatisfactorycharacter of the present arrangement but having re^ar^to the developments mentioned at the beginning ofparagraph 2, surely this is not the moment to try andtackle it by the drastic measures proposed by thePresident,   If de Gaulle now refuses.to meet Giraud r-op if he failed to reach agreement at a meeting cr ifhaving reached agreement he then proceeded to wreck;:it by a failure to collaborate loyally, then we agreethat we should certainly have to have a showdown withhim and might have to eliminate him in order either toestablish or maintain French unity./   6.

6. We are sending you in a separate telegramcomments on the various memoranda.   They contain littlethat is not Known to us and they can hardly be said tohave been written by unbiassed and objective observers.In particular-, Cambon and Gomert expressed the view,to British representatives when that were in Algiers,that Giraud was finished unless he took certain measuresat once and that his position depended on early union.We suspect that Murphy is becoming impressed by theevidence of rising gaullism in North Africa whichmust be reaching him and that he prefers to ascribethis to gaullist propaganda rather than admit that hewas as wrong about gaullist strength in North Africa ashe was about anti-British feeling there.   The fact is thatGiraud&apos;s retention of unpopular men and Murphy&apos;scontinued reluctance to ,;nsist oh their removal havehelped de Gaulle very considerable in North Africa.T.0.0.    2130Z/23(Circulation)Deputy Prime minister foreign secretary lord President of the CouncilMinister of labour minister of ProductionHome secretary sir Edward BridgesMr Martin

But all our information indicates that its success is due mainly to popular impatienceat the continuance in office of men like Nogu.es andPeyrouton rather than to de Gaulle&apos;s propaganda.(2) We do not subscribe to the view that thepeople of France are behind the Free French movementrather than the person of de Gaulle.   There is a-greatvolume of evidence from diverse sources to show that theNational Committee means little to the resisters andthat it is de Gaulle1s name alone that counts with them.The de Gaulle whom they follow is of course an idealisedsemi-mystic figure very different from the man we know.But nothing that Allied propaganda could do wouldconvince the French that their idol has feet of clayand the removal of de Gaulle would probably have a disastrous reaction on the whole resistance movement.The resisters would consider that the Anglo-Saxons hadbetrayed their leader and a further swing towardsRussia would be inevitable,   (We must remember thatthe resistance movements in France today inclinestrongly  towards the Left and that the Communistsplay a leading part)./(3) We know

(3) We know from most secret sourcesothat someof the Fighting French in North Africa are toying.withthe idea of rallying Giraud&apos;s forces on a large scale.On the other hand there seems little doubt that men insome of Giraud&apos;s units are very dissatisfied with the vichy outlook of some of their officers and would .willingly come over.   We heave heard stories both ofspontaneous defection and of active propaganda by theFighting French but have no definite evidence of either.Memorandum B.(1) The first sentence of paragraph 3 is misleading.Fighting French propaganda from British territory iscertainly financed from British funds but in return everyeffort is made to keep it within bounds.   All broadcastsfrom British-controlled stations have to conform withthe principles of our own propaganda directives.   Wehave insisted on this from the outset and it has led tomany fights with de Gaulle and the frequent censoringof undesirable material.   Three times has de Gaulle been refused access to the B.B.C.   We are powerless tocontrol propaganda from the Free French colonies.   nor do we finance it as these colonies are self-supportingin everything except military expenditure.(2) Paragraph 4 seems to us somewhat ungenerous.It disregards Bir Hakim and LeclerCs great march fromChad, and the admirable work of two Free French brigadesat El Alamoin.(3) We entirely agree that the future of Franceand the manner in which the free expression of theFrench will as to their government may best beobtained is a fundamental question on which it isessential that our two governments should be inagreement.   We had assumed that both governments were agreed:(a) that the French people themselves should be free to settle their own future,(b) that the body to be set up in Algiers willnot be recognised by us as the Government of France oreven as the provisional government of France; and(c) that this body would not be authorised to speak for France or recognised as responsible for Frenchinterests or territories other than those which haverallied or may rally to it.   Its functions must, however,be more than advisory since it will be responsible for administering all the territories of the French overseasempire lith the exception of Indo-China and, atpresent, the Antilles./(4) As to the

(4) As to the means whereby the will of the french people is to be obtained after the liberation we areprepared to examine any suggestions that may be submittedto us by Giraud, de Gaulle and their advisers in due course.. We are disposed to favour Giraud*s suggestions(Conseils Generaux) in this matter which are inaccordance with the laws of the Republic.(.5) But in any case we agree with the U0S.G. thatwhen Allied forces enter France the Allied C. in C, mustbe supreme.   It is not possible to say now how long itwill be possible for him to maintain that position, butthe President1s idea that a proud people like the Frenchwill submit to a !&apos;military occupation run by British findAmerican generals&quot; for &quot;six months or even a year&quot; issurely not practical politics and it is disturbing thathis mind should run on these lines.(6) We hope that you will agree to put the policy outlined above to the President and Mr Hull.Memorandum 0.We too have heard reports that a personal oath of allegiance to de Gaulle is required from all his followers: but we have failed to find any proof of this and both the National Committee and de Gaulle himselfhave categorically denied it, the former in a public statement:.   Two senior officers of resistance organisationsin France to whom the matter was recently mentioned saidthat they had never seen this form of oath or heard ofanyone being asked to sign it.   So far as we have beenable to ascertain; the actual text of the formula ofenlistment signed by French volunteers who apply tojoin the forces or services of Fighting France is infact as .follows&quot;The undersigned has declared that he has acquaintedhimself with the statutes affecting the personnel of theFighting French forces and that he engages himself toserve with honour, fidelity and discipline in the fighting french forces for the duration of the present war plusthree months&quot;.Telegram D. ;We find it incredible that de Gaulle could ever have said that he&apos;: would&apos; base &quot;his1 policy solely on Russia and perhaps on Germany. - He1 uses&apos; &quot;the Russians in Ills politicalgame but a-permanent&apos; association with communism would bealien to * his1 whole - nature; - - (-incidentally&apos;&apos; he is- a : devdutCatholic).

Telegram E.We see nothing sinister in this.   It is surelynatural that de Gaulle should want his chief lieutenantsaround him when he comes to do business with Giraud.Telegram F.The first sentence is contradicted by paragraph 4of memorandum Y .   It is untrue that any of Giraad*s ships have sailed without guncrews.   In the ;&apos;Fort de Douamont&quot;a second French guncrew was trained by British naval personnel before she sailed.   If guncrews desert from other of Giraud&apos;s ships and there is no time to train a freshcrew the Admiralty intend to replace them by trainedBritish naval -personnel.   The Admiralty are taking strongmeasures to prevent further desertions.ToIegram G.Cambon and Commert heave a bitter personal prejudiceagainst de Gaulle and will say almost anything to discredithim.   In this case their language to the U.S. Embassy seemsto have been very different from what they told british officials after their return from Algiers,   To the latterthey expressed the deepest misgivings about Giraud, whothey said was like Lebrun though with more than hisintelligence.   They deplored Giraud&apos;s seeming incapabilityto check dishonesty and corruption in his administration.Telegram H.We know nothing- of the incident to which the first paragraph refers.See also my immediately following telegram.TOO 2200Z/23CirculationDeputy Prime minister foreign secretary lord President of the CouncilMinister of labour minister of ProductionHome secretary sir Edward BridgesMr Martin

To break with de Gaulle would mean the automatic cancellation of theagreements concluded with him personally before theformation of the National Committee.   As we should not expect the National Committee to survive his removalthe later agreements between H.M.Government and theCommittee would also probably become void.   At this moment there are 80,000 Free French French troops in vrvarious theatres.   There are&quot;6,000 Free French Officersand men manning 47 ships, including 4 submarines, 16corvettes, etc   Free French help in the air has alsobeen most effective.   The facilities given us by theFree French in e.g. Eauatorial Africa contributed to the building up of&quot;our forces in the Middle East.2.    The following are the main agreements recognizingthe authority of de Gaulle and the National Committeeover their own followers and the French territories which have rallied to them:-(i)   The exchange of letters of August 7th, 1940,between yourself and de Gaulle providing for theestablishment of the Free French land, sea and airforces./(ii) Your letter

(n)   Your letter to de Gaulle of August 27th,1940, giving an undertaking that H.M. Governmentwould do everything in their power to maintain theeconomic stability of call French oversea territoriesprovided they stood by the alliance; and moreparticularly those territories which rallied tode Gaulle.(iii) The exchange of letters of January 15th,1941 between the Foreign Secretary and de Gaulle -governing the exercise of jurisdiction over the french forces and empowering the Fighting French toestablish their own military courts in the UnitedKingdom,(iv) The Financial Agreement concluded betweenthe Treasury and the National Committee in 1941,providing for the financing from British funds of allthe Committee&apos;s military expenditure and of their other expenditure in the United Kingdom (The free french colonies meet their civil budgets out of theirown revenues).(v) The agreement of December 14th, 1942.between H.M. Government and the National Committeegoverning the relations between the British militaryauthorities and the Free French authorities inMadagascar.(vi) Various exonomic agreements and less formalarrangements with the National Committee regulatingimport and export programmes in respect of french equatorial Africa, the Cameroons and Madagascar.3.    The invalidating of these agreements would inmany cases cause us serious embarrassment.   Withoutagreements (i) and (iii) the Free French Forces wouldbe left completely in the air.   Agreements (ii) and(vi) form the basis of our important trade with theFree French African colonies and their cancellationwould at once jeopardise if not destroy all themachinery that we&quot;have built up whereby they supply anumber of commodities of first importance to theAllied war effort in return for the consumption goods and other imports which they formerly obtained from france.

4,    We thin,k it well to bear all this in mind.   it shows that apart from the political objections to thecourse which the President advocates a precipitatebreak with de Gaulle would have far-reaching consequencein a number of spheJSB which the Americans have probablynever thought about.   Indeed an impossible situation would be created unless steps could be taken in advance to ensure that some other French authority was able and willing to take over these commitments which theNational Committee has entered into with us,5,    We are sorry not to be more helpful, but we are convinced that the Americans are wrong in this andadvocate a line which would not be understood here,with possible evil consequences to Anglo-american relations.
