(43)  87th CONCLUSIONS.  MINUTE confidential Annex(21st June,   1943,   5.30 p.m. )74FRANCEGeneral de Gaulleland GeneralJiraud.(previous reference:ff.m.(43) 75thCone lusions,Minute l).THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet atelegram which he had had from President Roosevelt(No.  288 of 17th June) and two telegrams which he hodsent in reply (Nos.  316 and 318 of 18th June) regardingGeneral de&quot;Gaulle&apos;g relations with the French CommitteeNational Liberation and his apparent desire to obtaincontrol of the French military forces in Africa.off ollows : --essential points in these telegrams were asThe President had sent to General Eisenhower atelegram defining the policy of the United StatesGovernment in respect of the control of the French Armyin --,frica.      This made it clear that.,  during their military occupation of North Africa,  the United StatesGovernment would insist that the French Array should be under the command of someone in whom they had complete confidence and should be subject to the directions of theAllied Supreme Commander.      They could not tolerate any French jurisdiction,  civil or military, which might in anyway endanger the safety of Allied troops or lines ofcommunication or otherwise interfere with Allied militaryoperations.      At the present time they &quot;would not permitGeneral de Gaulle to direct himself&quot;, or to control throughpartisans onin the fieldany Committee, the African French Army either of supplies,  training or operations&quot;.In communicating to the Prime Minister the text ofthis instruction to General Eisenhower- the President had suggested that the.time had come to break with General de gaulle and to encourage the creation of a Committee ofFrenchmen who &quot;really wished to fight the war and werenot thinking too much about politics&quot;.      As a first step,he suggested that every effort should be made to postponeany further meeting of the French Committee of national liberation,In his reply, the Prime Minister had welcomed thePresident&apos;s instructions to General Eisenhower regardingthe control of the French Army in North Africa.      It wasthat.4-:essential and trustworthy hands andSupreme Allied Commander,it clear that he would hotup the Committee of Seven,General Eisenhower carriedthe commana or this Array should be in loyalroperly subordinated to the at the same time, he had modeat this moment favour breakingor forbidding it to meet. Ifout the policy laid down inhis instructions. the Committee would be forced to choose between accepting that decision by a majority or placingthemselves in definite opposition to the British and

United States Governments.      If they accented thedecision   General de Gaulle and the other&quot;dissentientswould have to decide whether to submit to that decisionor to resign.      Our position would be fully safeguardedif we proscribed the conditions essential for the safety of our forces and placed on General-de Gaulle the onusof deciding whether he would accept our decision,  or resign.The bar Cabinet were also informed that a meeting had been he3d between General Eisenhower and GeneralsGiraud and de Gaulle at 10 aim.  on Saturday, 19th June,General Eisenhower had. informed the two Generals that,in view of his responsibilities and impending operations,he must insist on effective control of the French forcesbeing in the hands of General Giraud,  with whom he had worked during recent months.      He appealed to bothGenerals,  as a soldier to soldiers,  to accept this view, &apos;General de Gaulle had taken the view that this demandconstituted a breach of French sovereignty.      It had beenagreed that General Eisenhower&apos;s statement should be putinto written form and presented to the two Generals,  sothat it could, be considered by the Committee of Seven ata meeting to be held on Monday   21st June.The War Cabinet held a preliminary exchange of views on the position disclosed by these telegrams.The view was expressed that   while it wasunderstandable that the United States Government should lose patience with General de Gaulle,  it must not be overlooked that he exercised a considerable influenceamong those in Metropolitan France in whom the spirit of resistance had not been quenched.      To force a break withhim now would, not restore American prestige in France andmight damage ours;    and. it would certainly discourage thosein France for whom the name &quot;de. Gaulle&quot; was a symbol of resistance to the enemy,.On the other hand, it was the general view of theWar Cabinet that we could not conscientiously assure theUnited States Government that, if General de Gaulle werein control of the French Army in North Africa, the Alliescould rely confidently upon his loyal co-operation and.support in the Allied military operations now impending.That being so, we could not challenge the American viewthat it must be a    .....?lunary objective of our policy toensure that General de Gaulle did. not himself direct,  or control through partisans on the French Committee, theFrench Army in Africa,At the same time,  it was most desirable that this objective should,   if possible, be attained,  not by any-direct break with General de Gaulle   but through a majoritydecision of the French Committee.      When the Committee of seven had been appointed we had formally transferred to itthe relations which we had previously maintained withGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s Committee in London,      While,   in thelast resort    considerations of military security mustprevail,  there was no reason why we should, not continueto recognise and. support the Committee of Seven, as representing the forces of French resistance to the enemyprovided that it was willing to make arrangements for thecontrol of the French Army in Africa which satisfiedGeneral Eisenhov/er,- O

IfIt was agreed that it was vitally important toprevent this issue from clouding our relations with thePresident and the United States Administration.      If,however, the French Committee accepted General Eisenhower&apos;sconditions regarding the control of the French Army,  itwould be possible to avert any acute difference of view between ourselves and the U. S.  Government., and at the sametime to avoid taking action in respect of General de Gaullewhich would probably have a serious effect on Frenchopinion.The War Cabinet -Agreed to defer further discussion of this situation &quot;until it was known how the french committee of National Liberation had reactedto the statement which General Eisenhower had made to Generals Giraud and de Gaulle.Offices of the War CabinetS.
