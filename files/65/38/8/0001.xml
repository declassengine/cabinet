(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT).It.18 requested thai *&apos;* * &quot;ensure the ^ of t^^;;;;MOST SECRET COPY NO.  &apos;.&apos;II \ll*JLW1.74th CONCLUSIONS , MINUTE j.(Confidential Annex)(Blst May,  1943   -    5cOp.nu)FUTURE The- War Cabinet considered a telegram from the PrimeOPERATIONS     Minister (PENCIL 159) stating that he and the President ofthe United States had now received from the Combined ChiefsOperation       of Staff a formal statement stressing the extreme importanceLIFEBELT-.       of our acquiring the use of these Islands at the earliest moment?     The Prime Minister considered that this statementestablished the military necessity of the project;    and hedeveloped in his telegram the objections which he felt to thesuggestion that, before seizing the Islands by force, we should make a diplomatic approach to the Portuguese Governmentasking them to agree to our use of the Islands.     He believedthat such a request would be rejected;    and by making it we should increase the difficulties of the military operation by forfeiting the element of surprise.     He therefore asked tobe empowered to state, in the name of the War Cabinet, on thefollowing Monday that, if the President agreed to share thoresponsibility, wo would authorise the Combined Chiefs ofStaff to make and execute a plan to attack the Islands atthe earlidst possible momentoThe following wore the main points in a full discussion:-\a) The main point dealt with was that the Prime minister ys &apos;proposal seemed to involve making an attack, without warnings,on the territory of our oldest Ally, whom we had recently beenproviding with arms to defend herself against aggression.Grave difficulties were expressed about this aspect of thematter *     The War Cabinet were informed that, our Ambassador atLisbon thought there was some prospect of persuading Dr. Salazarto yield to a request for facilities on the Islands,  if madeby way of a diplomatic approach, particularly if it were madeat the present time, when our prestige was high after the victory in Africa.      If such an approach succeeded, we shouldhave secured the whole of our aim;    if it failed, we could still proceed to take the Islands by force;    and we should be ina far stronger position in the eyes of our Allies if weresorted to force only after other means had failed.On the general issue. Ministers generally (with theexception of the Home Secretary.- see (k) below) were strongly of the opinion that we should first make a diplomatic approach;and that if wo attacked the Islands without warning, our action would be badly received in this country, would create a veryunfavourable impression on our Allies, and would damage ourreputation after the war.(b) THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that the political difficulties of the project would be increased if it were desired that the United States should take any substantial part in theoperation.      Public opinion in Portugal was strongly pro-Britishand, if this action were taken by us alone, the mass of thepeople in Portugal would try to regard it in a favourable,, light.There was not, however, the same sympathy for the United states -among other reasons, because the Portuguese were suspicious of american ambitions in respect of these Islands.      If,  therefore,this operation were undertaken,  it was more important&apos;that itshould appear to be prodominantly British than it had been thatTORCH should appear predominantly Amcrioan.

(c) THE MINISTER OP PRODUCTION pointed out that account mustbo taken ox&quot; tho possibility that a broach with Portugalwould result in securing to the Germans larger supplies of wolfram, of which thoy were now in urgent need.     their stocks wore becoming exhausted, and production in countries under Axis c -ntrol   was  small.     They relied thereforeincreasingly or, what they obtained from Spain and Portugal.A breach; with Portugal must mean that we should get less,and the Germans noroj of the Portuguese supplies of wolfram.Though a drop in our supplies might not be disastrous for us,-n increase in Germany&apos;s supplies would be of valuable help to bor war prr cluctior,(1) Discussion then turned on the military aspects.THE VICE-CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF read to the War Cabinet the appreciation by tho Chiefs of Staff dated 10th May (D.O.(43)^8)., together with a telegram which had been sent tothe Prime Minister by the Defence Committee after consid-eratioh of this Report (ALCOVE 18l).(e) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  said thatM. Maisky had t -Id him that morning that the Russians had expected that the Germans would by now have launched anattack on them and were surprised that they had not done so.Was it possible that they were waiting to see where we shouldattack? If the Gorman forces were not engaged in an offensive against Russia, was it possible that they would have freereserves which they could use for other purposes;    as, forexample, for an occupation of tho Iberian Peninsula?THE VICE-CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said thatthis was a question which he would like time to consider.     Hewas, however, disposed to reply   that tho Germans1 mainpreoccupation would necessarily be the Russian Front, andthat the chances of the Germans invading the iberian peninsula, oven if we seized the Islands, were remote.Furthermore^ ho thought that it would be a very daring actionon the part of the Germans to invade the Peninsula before we had launched our offensive in the Mediterranean.(t) If the Germans occupied the Iberian Peninsula, would this make the passage through the Mediterranean more difficult?THE VICE-CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that, if the germans could deploy their air forces over the whole Peninsula,the passage of our ships through tho narrows of the western mediterranean&apos;would become very difficult.     He thought,however, that any diversion of German forces from theRussian Front was much more likely to be made towards theCentral Mediterranean than towards the Iberian Peninsula.(g) Reference was made to the effect of carrying out anassault on the Islands   &quot;within the next three or four weeks&quot;(See paragraph 4 of PENCIL 159) upon the HUSKY Operation.;     THE VICE-CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said thathe felt quite certain that the Prime Minister&apos;s view wouldbe that the HUSKY Operation should have priority.     He tooktho reference to carrying out an operation against the islands &quot;within the next three or four weeks&quot; as in thenature of a general directive to the Chiefs of Staff, thatthis operation should be carried out as quickly as possible,rather than as specifying an exact period.(h) It was pointod out that the main advantage of the planoutlined in PENCIL 159 was that we should not give thePortuguese time to increase the Islands&apos; power of resistance.As against this,  it was - argued that the plan favoured by the proposal e Minister did not provide for complete surprise,since it Was proposed that the Portuguese Government should be told the night before that occupation was about to take place.-2-

Some doubt was expressed as to whether the Portuguesewould be able to take any very effective measures toincrease the power of resistance of the Islands, even ifthe diplomatic approach was first tried and failed.,(JL) As regards the argument that the possession, of thoseIslands would save us- a million tons of shipping, it was -pointed out that such a figure would only accrue gradually.Furthermore, if we were to carry out the operation againstthe Islands in the near future, this would mean taking awayescorts from, the Atlantic convoys at a time when thoseoscor :s wore still in need of strengthening,     AfterSeptember,  however,  out? strength in escort vessels would rise rapidly, and we should better be able to afford such  a diversion r.It was also pointed out that various recent puttie stato-ments which had   boon made as to the progress of the battle of the Atlantic would make it difficult to argue that the seizure of these Islands at this moment vsas absolutely necessary.     While the War Cabinet would not shrink from. the course proposed if they were satisfied that it was essential to the winning of the war, they did not feelconvinced that this was the case0(j) It was also urged that the course of action proposed would hardly socm consistent with the fact that we hadrefrained from seizing the ports in Southern Ireland.IIP!) SECRET. JtY OF STATE FOE DOMINION&apos; AFFAIRS thoughtthat, so far as the Dominion Governments were concerned, itwould not be possible to adopt the course proposed without prior consultation &quot;a t any rate with the Prime Ministerof the Union of South Africa,.-.(k) THE HOME SECRETARY said that, so long as it did not prejudice HUSKY, he felt that there was much to be said infavour of the project for taking these Islands by force,without warning.      The Chiefs of Staff had shown that their possession would be of very substantial benefit to us in the battle of the Atlantico      It seemed to him to be most unlikely that the Portuguese Government would grant usthese facilities, on the basis of a diplomatic approach;and to make such an approach without success would forewarnthe Portuguese of our intention and make the military operation more hazardous*     Though the Portuguese were ourolde.at Allies,  their conduct during the present war had notbeen such as to call for any special consideration on our part.      Finally, he believed that bold action, on the lines suggested in the Prime Minister&quot;s telegram, would not bereceived unfavourably by public opinion in this country,, Hewas confirmed in that view by the public reaction   to earlieracts of the same kind,    eeg., the capture of the &quot;Altmark&quot;and the landing in North AfricaoThe general view of the War Cabinet was that the strong objections which they felt to the course proposed should becommunicated to the Prime Minister,  who should be asked thata decision on this matter should be postponed until the wholequestion could be discussed with him after his return.The terms of the tolcgram to the Prime Minister in this sense wore then discussed and. settled (See ALCOVE 354) .the War Cabinet, S.W.1. -3-
