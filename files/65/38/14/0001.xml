ItiS r6.qi(C;.!t KEY.MOST secret,M.(45)  t.&apos;5TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 6Confidential Annex(loth June,  1943,    5,0 p. m. )COPY NO.india the Viceroyaltyand System ofCommandTHE PRIME MINISTER said that he wished todiscuss with his colleagues the succession to theViceroyalty and also certain changes in the systemof Command in India.lie had reached the conclusion that a change inthe system of Command was called for in order toensure vigorous and effective prosecution of theoperations against Japan.      The United States had great interests in this area from the point of viewof sending supplies to China by air.      He had decidedthat the Command of operations in South East Asiashould &quot;be separated from the statutory office of commander-in-Chief in India.      This division betweenthe operational Command and the control exercised bythe statutory Commander-In-Chief in India had been recommended by the Committee of Imperial Defence in1929 in the event of a major campaign having to be conducted   with India as its base of operations.As regards the Command in-South East Asia,there were two models which might be followed - the model of the Middle East Command.,  where there were three co-equal Commanders-in-Chief;. and what mightbe called the North African model,  namely, a SupremeCouiiiiander-in-Chief. having under him a Naval, anArmy and an Air Commander.      He thought that for south East Asia the latter was the right form of organisation.Turning  to   the     Viceroyalty,  the PrimeMinister said that,  as his colleagues would be aware,the question of a successor to Lord Linlithgow had.been, under almost continuous consideration for about six months.      Prom many points of view it would havebeen desirable that a Member of the War Cabinet whowas familiar with the Cabinet&apos;s policy should hovebeen appointed to this post.      But he had come to theconclusion that it would be a great pity to make -changes now in the War Cabinet.      After muchconsideration he had recommended to His Majesty, whohad been pleased to approve,  the appointment asViceroy of Sir Archibald Wave11.      Sir Archibald hada gre t record of solid achievement behind him.    Hewas a man of wide views, and had served for eighteen months on the Viceroy&apos;s Council.      Since he hod made this recommendation to His Majesty,  he had beeninterested to find out that Sir Archibald. Wave 11 had expressed the opinion that not enough had been done for social reform in India and that he would be inthe fullest sympathy with striking this note.

There was the further consideration,,  that our first duty at the present time was to defend India,  and that political reforms must wait until the military situationin the Far East had improved.It was proposed to offer Sir Archibald havell theappointment of Viceroy for a period of three years.As his successor as statutory Coramande r - i n-C h i e f,he proposed the re-appointment of Sir Claude Auchinleck.He was sure that there was no-one who had better qualifications for the Command of the Indian Array, by whom he was held inthe greatest respect.The Prime Minister said that he hoped it might bepossible to make an announcement towards the end of theweek of the appointments of Sir Archibald Wavell andSir Claude Auchinleck, and, in principle, of the settingup of the South East Asia Command, although the detailsof the organisation of this Command would not be completedfor some time.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that he agreedthat the functions of Commander-in-chief,  India, and ofthe Commander-in-Chief of South East Asia should now be divided.      it was essential that the statutory commander-in-Chief should spend much of his time in exercisinginfluence on his colleagues on the Executive Council andin the work of organisation;  training,   inspection andconsolidation of the greatly expanded Indian Army.      Inhis view.  General Auchinleck -aas ideally suited for tbe post.Pie also favoured the appointment of a single supreme allied Commander for the South East Asia front.      At thepresent moment difficulties were arising because of thenumber of United States organisations which required to befitted into a regular framework.      Thus,  General Stillwellwas on occasion consulted by the U. S.  Government as to theextent to which demands for the Indian front should be meti,Sir Archibald Wavell was a man of wide outlook, whohad had considerable contact with political affairs in theMiddle East and had proved himself a valuable member ofthe Viceroy&apos;s Council.      It was also relevant that, at thepresent time, public opinion in India did not expect verymuch in the way of reforms in the political sphere.      Onthe whole,  he thought that General Wavell would be able to lead and control the Executive Council and to keep India&apos;mind on the war.      These were the two most importantqualities required of a Viceroy appointed at the present time.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE thoughtthat it would be a great pity if the appointment of the newViceroy was made on the basis that he was a &quot;safe&quot; man andthat no progress was to be made during the next three years.He thought that there was not enough economic advice atthe Viceroy&apos;s disposal,  and that the present was a first-rate opportunity for turning the minds of the people ofIndia from political agitation towards economic progress.Further,consideration should be given to India&apos;s place inthe scheme of defence of the British Commonwealth.      Forthis purpose he thought that India might form part of somelarger defence grouping.

Generally,  the Minister of Labour and NationalService was anxious to see India taking a more prominentposition in the Eastern.world.The Minister of Labour also stressed the importanceof the new Viceroy not maintaining the somewhat isolatedposition of the present Viceroy.THE MINISTER OR AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION stressed thepoint that Sir Archibald Wavcll should not be regarded asa stopgap.      It was an advantage that he would regard his task mainly as a non-political one,  and it was important that he should have good advice on the economic side of hisdut i es.THE PRIME MINISTER said that a number of difficultissues would arise which would involve, for example,conflicts over priorities in connection with administration which would arise between the Supreme Commander and the Indianauthorities.      These would have to be settled as they arose,on the authority of the Viceroy,  acting on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.      The Viceroy would have under him for this purpose a Senior Administrative Officer with asmall Handling Section to settle,  on his behalf,  the day today problems.ar Ghi net: -(l) Took note,  with approval,  of the proposedseparation of the Command of Operations inSouth East Asia from the Office ofCornwonder-in-Chief, India,  and of theproposed appointments to the Vice-royaltyand. to the office of Commander-in-Chief inIndia. . -(3) Asked the Secretary of State for India,  theMinister of Aircraft Production and theMinister of Information to prepare a draft statement, which should be submitted tothe Prime Minister,  for use by the Presswhen these two new appointments and the setting up of the new Command were announced.(5) Approved the suggestion that the princirjalnewspaper proprietors should be seen beforethe appointments were announced.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister proposed to telegraph to The King as to the proposal tore-appoint General Sir Claude Auchinleckas Commander-in-Chief in India;    and also toGeneral Auchinleck,  as soon as general sir Archibald Wavell had definitely accept&amp;the post of Viceroy.Offices of the(0) Agreed that there should be no statement as to Sir ArchibaldWavell&apos;s tenure being for threeyearsu      There was no statutory termof office for the Viceroy andSir A.
