COPY NO.   \ Ci,.W.M.(45)61st conclusions confidential Annex(29th April, 1943 - 12 noon)FAR EAST THE PRIME MINISTER said that the three Commanders-in-Chief had been summoned home for consultation, and heMilitary thought the War Cabinet would bo interested to hear theirpituation.     views on the situation in Burma and the Indian Ocean.Operations in Arakan had been very disappointing,and the general conditions of warfare in Burma favoured the Japanese     The mountainous jungle country forbadethe use of modern weapons, and hampered the operations of aircraft.     Communications wore few and difficult, malariawas prevalent, and the morale of our troops was reportedto be less high than it should be*     At Casablanca wehad agreed - largely as a concession to United Statesopinion - to mount a full-scale operation for the re-capture of Burma between the monsoons of 1943 and 1944.Since then, the demands made on shipping by HUSKY, andother commitments, had increaseda and we had not been ableto provide the shipping required to carry to the indian ocean the requirements of the Burma operation.     We should probably have to relinquish the idea of reconquering Burmaduring the coming winter.     Alternatives were being studied by the Chiefs of Staff in consultation with the Commanders-in-Chief.In the meanwhile, an invitation had been receivedfrom the United States Chiefs of Staff for the threeCommanders-in-Chief to return to India via Washington,where they would meet General Stilwell and General Chennault,who had been summoned there.     It was open to doubt whetherthis invitation should be accepted, in view of the naturalurge which existed in America to devote resources to the war against Cfeparv He (the Ppirae Minister) would much rather that the thitedStates Chiefs of Staff should come to London.  On the other baud,if the invitation were rejected, and things did not go well,it would&apos; afford a pretext to the Americans for saying thatwe had. neglected an opportunity for making a combined plan.The matter would have to be carefully considered.The Prime Minister then asked the Commanders-in-Chiefto give their views on the situation.SIR ARCHIBALD WAVELL said that the situation in Burmawas entirely governed by communications.,     These were bad,  -not only in Burma, but in North East India, where theRiver Brahmaputra (over which there was no bridge) preventedthrough road or rail communication     There was only asingle track metre-gauge railway in Assam, which in peace-time took two or three trains a days     This had now been worked up to its maximum capacity, and river transport had   also been developed, though the latter was hampered by thedispatch of river craft to Iraq earlier in the war.     Theresult was some congestion in North East India, where bothAmerican and British airfields wore being developed on alargo scale,,- for which purpose a great deal of material hadto be brought ina     This competed with the development of-1

the communications themselves,,     Until a year age, there wasno road between India and Burma.     Now there was 260 miles of difficult road from the railhead at Manipur to the chindwin Valley.      Two roads were being made,  one forward from Imphal, and one from Ledo to Myitkyina0     The whole country was covered with jungle, and the malaria was verysevereoAfter the Casablance Conference, instructions had beenreceived for a full-scale invasion of Burma in the winter of 1943/44 to be prepared.      In consultation with the americans,- a.plan had therefore been made for an advance bya British Corps from Manipur and a Chinese Corps from Ledo,with the object of joining hands with the Chinese Armyadvancing from Yunnan.&apos;    This advance would be carried toMandalay,     Meanwhile, landings would be made at various points in lower Burma, and a direct assault would be madeon Rangoon.     This plan was to be put into effect inNovember, in the hopes that it would permit the reduction ofthe country before the onset of the ensuing monsoono  He had always regarded ihe opsrafeton as dffikxfli aid attended with eonslidsr:hte hoards. the assault on Rangoon, wnich was essential to success, meant a landing right up the river which was the only way in0Nevertheless, no other plan could be found?  and providedeverything went well, and all preparations were completed totime, he thought that the plan, though hazardous3 mightsucceed.     It required the shipment of 180,,000 tons to theIndian Ocean every month from March 1943o     During March and april, however, only 60/70,000 tons a month had actually been shipped..     This meant inevitably the postponement of theoueration, which in its turn meant that it had little or no chance of   being carried through in the time availableoThe operations which had been taking place in Arakanhad as their object the capture of Akyab0      If enough assaultshipping had been available, a direct attack on Akyab wouldhave been made, but without the shipping there was no wayof doing the operation except by a land advance down theMayu Peninsula,-      Arakan was the worst part of Burma inwhich to operate, and could never be a route for invasion,,The operations had shown up certain weaknesses in training and leadership of our troops, and had given us a good insightinto the Japanese tactics, which were undoubtedly skilfuloConsiderable loss had also been caused to the enemya     Itwas hoped to profit by what had occurred.     At the same time as the Arakan operations, a specially trained and organisedBrigade had moved across the Chindw3.n-  to cut the railwaybetween Wunto and Myitkyina.     This had been done success-fully, and the Brigade had then crossed the Irrawaddy witha&apos; view to raiding the Japanese.     Unfortunately, most of themules with the Brigade had died of anthrax,  so that it hadbeen necessary to withdraw in small columns,  some of whichhad got back, and some were still out.      The object had been to gain experience of such operations, and although it had originally been intended to carry them out in conjunctionwith an advance by the Chinese from Yunnan   which had notmaterialised,  they had, he thought, been valuable,The monsoon would be breaking in two or three weeks&apos;time, and as far as possible troops would be withdrawn fromthe unhealthy regions.     Two Divisions, which would form the holding force during the monsoon, would not be fit for operations next winter.     Various alternatives to a full-scale invasion of Burma had been considered, one of which wasto advance into Northern Burma, and to try to occupy as farSouth as Mandalay-and the dry belt.      The difficulty about this was that communications through to Mandalay could notbe established within the time available,/     On the whole,therefore, it seemed better to restrict our operations

IS* * - fcnext, winter to something more limited,.and to concentrate onthe build-up of airfields and the air route to China0 .SIR RICHARD PSIRSE gave an account of the progress which had been made in building up the Air Forces in India.Initially, the object had been to develop resources tocover Ceylon and Bengal.     When this had been done, and the threat appeared to have receded, the build-up had been directed to the offensive,, with the object of gaining air superiority in Burma, and supporting the land operations.We might now be said to have gained air superiority, thoughthe Japanese had adopted the practice of withdrawing fromall their forward aerodromes, and holding back out of reach of our bombers,.     They had so developed airfields and facilities,  that they could concentrate rapidly in anydesired direction, carry out two or three raids, and thenagain withdraw0     Our chief need was for long-range fighters and bombers,.     The original target had been for a build-upof about 70 Squadrons,     We now had 46 Operational, of which^4 were engaged in general reconnaissance, and other duties in Ceylon and on the North West Frontier, leaving 22 forfighting,,     Ae many as possible had boon concentrated for-.ori aerodromes on the Burma frontier- though somewarning sysfern,0n oxPGrioncod in arranging an adequateSIR JAMES SOMERvILLE said that the Naval situationin the Indian Ocean could only be judged in the light ofprojected operations in other theatres0     At the presenttime, the Fleet had been obliged to confine their activities to escorting convoys, and anti-submarine work, off the coast of Africa,     No offensive operations whatever had beenpossible       He was not at all in favovir of the plan for thereconquest of Burma,     Its success would depend upon cover for landings given entirely by seaborne aircraft, and also on the absence of fortifications on the Rangoon River.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Eastern Fleet hadcertainly boon greatly reduced, and this had been possibleowing to the absence of any forward move by the Japanese,Meanwhile, our Air strength in India and Ceylon had been very greatly increased.     The most serious problem was the landsituation,j and the plan which had been made for the recon-quest of Burma looked extremely unpromisingo     It could notbe said that the conquest of Burma was an essential step inthe defeat of Japan, though the Americans were in favour ofthe attempt..    Nor would the occupation of Northern Burmamean the immediate resumption of traffic on the Burma Roadja year would be required for its restoration.     Everythingpointed to an alternative line of action, and this the Chiefsof Staff would study with the Commanders-in-Chief,     In the meanwhile, we must not let the Americans drift away from the conception of Germany as the major enemy.     He hoped that sir Archibald Wavell and Lord Leathers would consult tog-ether over the Indian&apos;shipping requirements,.     These shouldbe scrutinised, and divided into their component parts.     Weshould not try to build up too big an Army in India,  and wecould not afford to waste shipping which would be sourgently required in the Mediterranean,SIS ARCHIBALD WAVELL said that no new Divisions were nowbeing formed, and the intake of recruits was only for main-tenance and the formation of ancillary units.    -He hoped thatour; propaganda would be directed to instilling the importanceof the war against Japan. ..   It was most necessary that theBritish soldiers in India should be made to feel that theywere taking part in campaigns which were of the utmost importance, .and which must be carriud through,THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the Secretary of Statefor India should take up this point.the War Cabinet, S.W.I.-S-
