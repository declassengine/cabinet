Indeed,Mr Hopkins had said that there might be some political difficulties if we   abstained from doing so.The matter had accordingly been raised at theAlgiers Conference on the 3rd June, when it had beenagreed that he (the Prime Minister) and general marshall should be invited to recommend to the british war Cabinet and the United States Chiefs of Staffrespectively,    that General Eisenhower should, beempowered to take action at his discretion againstthe marshalling yards at Rome, as soon as he thought -best for the successful prosecution of HUSKY.The Prime Minister said that military opinion &quot;was clearly in favour of bombing the marshalling yards at Rome, on the ground   that this would, seriouslyimpair the enemy&apos;s reinforcement route to South Italy.There were two marshalling yards in Rome, theS*\.r\ Lorenzo railway marshalling &quot;yard and the Littoriomarshalling yard*    These   y ords were about 3^ milesfrom the Vatican City, which was on the other side ofthe Tiber.The bombing would be carried out by Portresses,which had shown    great accuracy in the    clear   atmosphere of the Mediterranean, ar/i were expected to inflictsevere damage to the yards .The Prime Minister added, that we had never agreed,to refrain from bombing Rome.    There was the possibility that if we    did. so the  e enemy would, bomb Cairo from.Crete and Greece.   Air Chief Marshal Tedder had,however, expressed confidence that any such attackscould be dealt with.The. question was raised whether it would, be more effective to attack viaducts on the Italian railways .THE CHIEF OF1&apos;THE AIR STAFF said that he was satisfied that an attack on tho marshalling yards wasa much more effective nothod of hampering the enemy&apos;scommunications.The War Cabinet -Agreed that General Eisenhower shouldbe given authority to order the bombing of   the marshalling yards at Rome at themoment which he   thought best for thesuccessful prosecution of HUSKY, and invited the Prime Minister to send a message inthis sense to the President.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.

Annex(9th June,  1943,  12.15 p. in. )SITRADE disputes act(previous reference-W.M. (42) 57 th conclusions,Minute 2).Themight ariseOffice WorkersCongress.Air   Cabinet considered the position which from the application of the&quot;Union of Postor affiliation to the Trades Union; their Annual Conference in May the Union hadto apply for affiliation to the T.U. C.      Inthe Branches of the Union were recommended toto the industrial, hut not to thepolitical, sections of local Trades Councils.      Onthe Union had formally applied for affiliationT. U. C. j    and on the following day Sir Walterin o public speech, had said that the T.U.C. hadhat,  whatever the risks,  organic connection with civil Service Trade Unions would be re-established, andthat the Congress were determined, to use their power tosec that no vindictive punishment and no deterrentmeasures wore imposed, without the power of the TradeUnion movement being placed &quot;in protection&quot; of theindividual Civil Servant.Applications for affiliation by local Branches ofresolvedaddition,oot) l1 ..;.nywith theCitrine,decided -the Union of Post Office dor]Blackpool Trades Council and the London Tradeson 26th and 20th May respectively.ers had been accepted by theCouncilTatTrtWar Cabinet were reminded that under section 5Le Disputes and Trade Unions Act, 1927,of theRegulations regarding the conditions of service in HisMajesty/s civil establishments must include Regulationsprohibiting established Civil Servants from being members,delegates or representatives of any organisation whoseprimary object is to influence or affect the remuneration and conditions of employment of its members,  unless theorganisation (i)  is confined to persons employed by orunder the Crown;    and (ii) complies with provisions in theRegulations for securing that it is independent of, andnot affiliated to, any such organisation which is not confined to persons employed by or under the Crown or anyfederation comprising such organisations and (iii) complieswith provisions in the Regulations for securing that itsobjects do not include political objects and that it isnot associated directly or indirectly with any political party or organisation,Regulations made under this section provide thatno established Civil Servant may be a member of such an organisation unless there is in force a certificate,granted by the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies withthe approval of the Treasury, certifying that theorganisation is an approved association.      The Regulationsprovide that a certificate of approval must be cancelledif at any time the Treasury is not satisfied that theorganisation fulfils the relevant conditions.

SiIf the Union of Post Office Workers &quot;becameaffiliated to the Trades Union Congress,  the certificate of approval would have to he cancelled;    and allestablished Civil Servants belonging to the Union wouldthereupon be in contravention of section 5(l) of the Act.By section 5(2) of the Act they would have to be warnedforthwith by the Head of their Department and,  if within one month after that warning they had not resigned fromthe Union,  they would in the words of the Act be&quot;disqualified for being members of the OioulService ;&apos;.It was pointed out that these consequences would follow by the automatic operation of the law.      TheTreasury was required by the statute to make regulations in this sense;    and had no discretion to avoid theseconsequences by amending the Regulations or by failing to enforce them.      There were only three possible means by which these consequences could be averted -(i) A decision might be reached,  either by the union or by the T. U. C. , not to proceed with thisproposal for affiliation.(ii) It was  open to any member of the Union to applyto the courts for an injunction   to preventthe Executive Council of the Union fromproceeding with their application for affiliation.If such on injunction were granted,  it would becontempt of court for the Executive Council toproceed with the application.(iii) If neither of these courses were adopted,  theconsequences described above could only be averted by fresh legislation amending section 5of the Act of 1927.The main points in discussion were: -(a) The applications  of local branches, of the Union foraffiliation to local Trades Councils did not raise anyserious question.      It was doubtful whether suchaffiliation contravened the Act of 1927.      The LawOfficers were considering that point.      And, from thepoint of view of policy,  there was no serious objectionto such affiliation with local Trades Councils.(b) THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE saidthat the Act of 1927 had aroused strong feelings in theTrade Union movement;    and for some time it had been thepolicy of the &quot;movement to press for the repeal of thewhole Act.      More recently^ however,  the main objective of the Trade Union movement had been to secure the repeal of sections 5 and 6 of the Act;    and,  if those sectionscould be dealt with to their satisfaction,  there was areasonable prospect that they would not challenge theremainder of the Act..

He recognised, however,  that in the conservative party there was strong feeling agaist any modificationeven of these sections of the Act.      He doubted whethera solution could be found by discussion between thepolitical Parties;    and he thought that,  in order to take this question out of politics,  it would be preferable to arrange for some enquiry by an independent body,charged with, the duty of examining the operation of thesetwo sections of the Act and submitting recommendations to the Government as to the modifications which might bemade.      The Minister recognised, however,   that theapplicati m made by the Union of Post Office Workers andits reception by Sir &quot;-alter- Citrine had made it moredifficult to make any progress towards a settlement ofthe general issue.      The Government could not yield toa threat to contravene the existing Act, and could nottheref re take any further action,  whether by appointing a Committee of enquiry or otherwise, until that&quot;threathad been withdrawn.(c) In discussion,  it was confirmed that there was strong opposition among members of the Conservative Partyto proposals for the repeal of sections 5 and 6 of theAct of 1927.      Moreover,  this opposition had now been strengthened by the threat of the Union of Post office workers and Sir Walter Citrine to defy the law.      a situation had thus been created in which it was evenmore difficult than before to put forward any proposalsfor modification of these sections of the Act..(d) It was pointed out that the application of theUnion of Post Office Workers could not be formallyconsidered by the Trades Union Congress until their annual Conference in September next.      There was,,therefore, a substantial interval during which wisercounsels might prevail.      In this connection it was notedthat the Post Office Engineering Uni m were meeting onthe following day to consider whether they should makea similar application for affiliation to the T. U. C.      Itwas possible that they might take a somewhat differentview from the Union of Post Office Workers.      It wasalso possible that other Civil Service Unions might indicate that they were not proposing to seek affiliationwhile the lav; remained   unchanged.      Such developments,might cause the Trades Union Congress  to modify its pre s e nt a 11 i tude.The general conclusion of the War Cabinet was thatthe Government could not take any action with a view tomodifying the Act of 1927 until the threat implied bythe decision of the Union of Post Office Workers andSir Walter Citrine&apos;s acceptance of it had been withdrawn.Meanwhile,  nothing should be done, or said, on behalf of-the Government which might tend to exacerbate the feelings of either of the parties to this controversy.      The Pressmight be advised to avoid discussion of the matter, andall other practicable steps should be taken to preventthe issue from being brought to a head.      Means might-o-
ft
also be found to make clear to the Union or the T. U. C.the dangers of the course on which they had embarked.If,  as a result, the present threat to flout the lav/were.withdrawn,  and a favourable opportunity arose for considering some modification of the Act, the-WarCabinet would wish to  see whether some means could. n:)tbe found, of arriving at agreement regarding the modification of sections 5 and 6 of the Act.    If,however,  the Union and the T.U. C.  persisted in theirpresent attitude-,  the Government should not fail tomake it clear to the members of the Unions concernedwhat their position would be if their Unions becameaffiliated to the T. U. C.  while section 5 of the act of 1927 remained unaltered..The War Cabinet agreed to review the positionagain  in three weeks1 time.Offices of the War Cabinet,3.W. 1.
