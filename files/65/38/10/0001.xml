The negotiations would beCrown who would go tothe Portuguese wouldMinister of the express purposeprotest ond withoutconducted by aPortugal for that be given no hopethat they could avert the occupation of the Islands, andit would be made to appear that their only choice was toprevent bloodshed and to gain the benefits which weshould offer in return for the lease.    If, however, thisbluff failed and the Portuguese refused our request and made it clear that they would back their refusal byarmed resistance, then the expedition could be called off at the last moment.The Prime Minister was proposing to put thissuggestion to the President that day, and asked that he might be authorised to inform him on the following day that the War Cabinet endorsed itsThe general view ofthe War Cabinetpiweis that,if the plan now suggested by the Prime Minister were adopted, it was most unlikely that the expedition would,in the event, be called   off,even if the Portuguese showed that they would resist the occupationaThe Prime Minister pointed out that the War Cabinetin their telegram had given ho reason&quot;for&apos;thinking that a diplomatic approach had some chance of success.   it seemed as though the Prime Minister1s plan was based,  inpart at least, on the view that a diplomatic approach,,with no show of force behind It, was almost certain tobe refused.    In this connection the following- points weremade: -First, H.M. Ambassador at Lisbon0, who was notinclined to optimism, had advised that it should not beregarded as impossible to obtain Dr. Salazarls consent,,All previous experience of Dr. Salazar indicated that hewas much more likely to react favourably if we asked thePortuguese to give as facilities in the Islands in pursuanceof their obligations under the Treaty of Alliance.   Hewas certain to resent very strongly any appearance of an ultimatum or a threat.    This view was endorsed by ministers who had personal knowledge of Dr. Salazar*

Secondly,  it could be made clear to the Portuguesethat-, if they acceded to a request for facilities in theIslandsj the forces to. be sent there in that event wouldbe exclusively British.    This was a factor which mightinfluence the Portuguese towards acceding to the request,especially if they had any suspicion that, in default oftheir agreement.; there was risk of a joint Anglo-Americanoccupation of the Islands.Thirdly,  if we had invoked this  Alliance andfailed to obtain by this means the facilities which were quired,?, wc,  should, bo in a far stronger position, inth ; eyes   of the Portuguese and of the rest of the world,to justify taking other measures to secure our requirements.It was the general view of the War Cabinet thatwe should not be justified in taking, without warning,action contrary to our Ti^treaty of Alliance with Portugalunless such action was vital to the effective prosecution of the ware     The War Cabinet considered that this hadnot yet been shown to be the case and that they must therefore adhere to their view that a dimplomaticapproach should be made to the Portuguese Government inthe first instance^    They next considered whether theyshould recommend that such a diplomatic approach should,be mad ; in the near future, or whether it should be deferred until the expedition had been mounted so that,if it were refused, the Islands could be occupied by force at short notice.Under the second alternative, the suggestionput forward was that the diplomatic approach should bemade as soon as the expedition had sailed, i.e.  about days before    the landing.      THE VICE CHIEF OF THEIMPERIAL general  STAFF said that, from the military pointof view, It would have been preferable,  if possible, toovoid giving any warning as this would forfeit the element of surprise;    but,  if any warning were to be given, therewas   ho thought little practical difference between the36 hours which would be given under the Prime Minister&apos;proposal and the 7 or 8 days which would elapse if a diplomatic approach were made when the expedition was about to sail;.      If. however, a diplomatic approach were made some months before the ex-pedition was mounted then therewas a risk that steps would be taken to strengthen,  the defences of the Island;    on the other hand it was possiblethat the longer interval would allow time for thesuspiedd^ts     raised to subside.    But in any event he didnot think that the delay involved would seriously prejudice the chances of military success^    THE VICECHIEF CP THE NAVAL STAFF pointed out that if thePortuguese were to tell the Germans that they had reasonto suspect an attack on these Islands, 8 days would givethe Germans ample time to concentrate a force of U-boats in the vicinity,,The general view of the War Cabinet was that itwas essential that we should, in the first instance, makea diplomatic approach to Dr. Salazar, unaccompanied bythreats of force., and based on an invocation of the alliance:,    This was the method best calculated to obtainwhat we wanted without recourse to force.   Moreover, ifthis approach was rejected. Dr. Salazar would have shownthat the Alliance was of little value, and we should bein a stronger moral position than if, without and preliminary approach, we were suddenly to threaten to seize by force the territory of an Ally.    Moreover, itwas not thought that the delay consequent upon recourse tothe diplomatic approach would seriously prejudice the chances of military successo- on

The question how long an interval    shouldelapse between the diplomatic approach and (in the eventof its refusal) a military operation for seizure ofthe Islands was one to he determined later in the lightof military considerations.    It should be made clearthatr in our view., a British expedition would meet with less resistance and resentment than an Americanexpedition-;Cabinet:-Invited the Foreign Secretary toprepare,,  in the light of thediscussion a telegram*informing the Prime Minister of the WarCabinet5s views at &quot;X&quot;oOffices of the War Cabinet, S,W.l.The terms of this telegram, despatched asALCOVE 38&apos;?&apos;, were considered and approved ata subsequent meeting of the War cabinet held later the same day (W*M.(43) 77):^3.
