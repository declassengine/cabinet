But it was reported thatthe U.S.&apos;bombing was so inaccurate that anti-Americanfeeling was being built up in France.    The particular case quoted was the attack aimed at the marshalling yards at Rouen^ which had resulted in heavy casualties in the City.&apos;THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that, after this attack, he had told General Eaker of.the reports,which had been received and had asked him that particular care should be exercised when bombing   targetsof this nature?    Since that date there had been no case where serious injury had been inflicted on the civilpopulation in Franco.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought thatthe United States Array Air Force should not carry outattacks on targets in France where this was liable to cause heavy civilian casualties.    There was, of course,no objection to their continuing to bomb the enemy submarine bases from which the civilian population hadbeen evacuated.    He. asked the &quot;Chief of the Air Staff to impress-this on General. Eaker.     It was of course tobe hoped/that, an increasing proportion of the attacksof the U&amp;ited States Army Air Force would be directed against targets in Germany.of the War Cabinet, S*W.l,

TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it Is requastsd that spoofal care may ba tal;en *ianaurs) the saorwy of this documentI (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;^ GOVERNMENT).JRT&apos; SECRET.COPY NO.WBM.(4-3y 56TH CONCLUSIONS t MINUTEGonfidential Annex,(19 th April, 1943 - .5*30 p.m* )NEW Zealand division.The War Cabinet were informed of a recentexchange of telegrams about the participation ofthe New Zealand Division in operations, after the african coast had been cleared of the enemy.On the 14th April the Prime Minister had sent a telegram to Mr. Eraser (Winch No. 1*) informing him of the operations which it was intended toundertake-after the African coast had&apos;been clearedof the enemy;    saying that Generals Alexander andMontgomery were most anxious that the New Zealand division should take part^in these operations;    and asking if the New Zealand Government would alloy/ itsDivision to take part in them.   Mr. Eraser had replied on the 17th April (Pefra Noa 1) that he had given an undertaking to consult the New ZealandParliament before any such decision was given, thatthe House of Representatives would normally meeton the 19th May, and that he did not think a special meeting could bib&quot; arranged before the 5th May,    he felt that a sudden summons of Parliament for the immediately ensuing week might give rise to unduealarm and speculation, and he suggested that thematter should be discussed with the New ZealandMinister of Defence (Mr, Jones) who was in Londonc&apos;:    On the 18th April the Prime Minister had sent a further telegram (Winch&apos;No. 3) explaining that if the New Zealand Division was to take part inoperation.HUSKY its immediate withdrawal to Egyptfor.special $raining in amphibious operations wasnecessary,    A decision could not, therefore, be postponed until May.   He had enquired whether weshould be justified in acting on the assumption of afavourable response from the New Zealand Parliaments. This, had been followed up by a further telegram from the Prime Minister (Winch No, 4)transmitting a message from General Alexander tothe effect that the delay in getting an answer aboutthe Nev; Zealand Division was causing him grave concern? since he could not make plans for the battleuntil he had obtained an answer.Two telegrams had been received that day from Mr* Fraser (Pefra Nos. 2 and 3),    In the lattertelegram, he stated that he could not assume responsibility for a favourable answer.    The NewZealand War &apos;Cabinet would, of course, agree that theNew&apos;Zealand Division should be taken out of Tunisiafor special training, provided it was clearly understood that such agreement did not amount to a commitment of the Division to the task indicated beforethe .N.ew Zealand Parliament had had an opportunity of discussing the matter.

isTHE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff explained that, owing to the limited training-facilities available, It was not possible to trainmore than the number of Divisions which would take part in the HUSKY assaults   He thought that general alexander was faced with the need for an immediate decision whether to employ the New Zealand division in the forthcoming battle or to take it out of theline and send it back for training in amphibiousoporations6The War Cabinet.&apos;. s view was that, whileit was likely that the New Zealand Parliament, whenthe time came, would be willing to allow theirDivision to take part in the HUSKY Operation, itwould not be right to take the risks involved in planning on this assumption.    The right course was therefore that a telegram should be despatchedby the Prime- Minister to General Alexanderinforming him that it was not possible to obtain an immediate decision, on which he could rely, thatthe New Zealand Division would be available forHUSKY, and that he should therefore make his plans on the assumption that the Division would not be soavailable..^Note: After the Meeting, telegrams were sent by the Prime Minister to General Alexanderin the sense of the above (021125), and toMr* Fraser to inform him of the   War Cabinet&apos;decision (Winch No* 5)^,7Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1...
