Discussion then turned, on   the terms of thedeclaration (Annex II to D.0.(43) 10).The War Cabinet agreed that    if the   declaration was to take its present form, the word &quot;political&quot;should,   be deleted from paragraph 9.   There was,however, general support for the viev; that the declara-woul dculties   would, bo avoided, if emphasis could beplaced loss on the political future than on    the re-uniting of families and the restoration of peacefullives.    It was also suggested that promises should be avoided (in view of the plight of the occupied territories we could not undertake to make amplefood supplies available),    and that the reference tothe Atlantic Charter should be omitted.The War Cabinet:-(a) Agreed that a telegram should be despatched to the Prime Minister&quot; stating that if itwas intended to adopt   the draft -declaration   which&quot; &apos; had.   boonsent to Washington/,  the word &quot;political&quot;should be omitted from paragraph 9;    butadding that it was proposed to forward a revised draft of the declaration in    thenear future.Vb) Invited the Minister of information to   prepare and submit to the foreign secretary a rovisod declaration in thelight of the discussion)?Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to inform the PrimeMinister that, in their view, theswitch from &quot;hard&quot; to &quot;soft&quot; propagandashould be made much nearer the date of as ion.

(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).TO BE KEPT^derlockand K8V S..^MOST SECRET. COPY NO.   A V4&amp; . W.Iv!.(43)  7 3RD CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2C onf ident ial Annex(21st May, 1943 - 12 Noon)WOCCUPIED The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by enemy the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P.(43)TERRITORY,, 214; raising a point on the draft of a general- directive dealing with the Civil administration ofArrangements      HU3KYLAND when in Allied, military occupation,for civil administration. It was common ground that leading Fascist officialswould have to be removed from office.   We had proposedthat they should be replaced by subordinate Italianofficials, chosen   because their sympathies were notFascist, and because they were capable administrators.The American view was that the holders of all importantposts, e,gn, Prefects and Mayors of important towns,would inevitably be Fascists and would have to beremoved.     They thought that the powers previouslyexercised by the holders of these manor positionssh..uld be handed ever to Allied officers.In his Memorandum? the Foreign Secretary saidthat ho thought the American scheme was unworkable, as there would not be enough qualified Allied administr-waters to go rounds     The result of the American policy would be that we should have to accept as administratorslarge numbers of untrained Americans of Italian origin.This would lead to a serious loss of efficiency, if notto a breakdown of the Civil Government,The Foreign Secretary annexed to his Memorandum adraft reply y/hich, while it accepted the view that our aim should be a purely Military Government, maintained that for practical reasons we should have to fall back onItalians in a number of cases.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he was anxious toavoid disagreement on this point and that, provided wecould reach accommodation on a middle line, he thought we could bo satisfied, inasmuch as control would inpractice rest with General Alexander and Lord Rennell,as   Chief Civil Affairs Officer.THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER suggested that it wasnot necessary? as proposed in paragraph 3 of the draft reply, that the selection of Italians for posts ofPrefects or for Mayors should be confined to subordinateItalian officials,,     There might be non-Fas cist ItaliansII who would be suitable for these posts, but who were notholding any official position,THE LORD PRESIDENT said that the phrase &quot;purely military Government&quot; might be read in two senses.     Ifa. it meant that the authority of the Military Commander^ must be imchallenged and supreme, no-one could take exception to ite     If, however, it meant that local administration must be permeated with military officials at all levels^ this was a proposition which we should certainly not accept? since it would mean putting inentirely unsuitable and inefficient people, with resultsthat would be disastrous.     The Lord President suggested-1-

that the line should, be that all important Fascistofficials, and other persons on whom no reliancecould be placed, should be removed;    but that only if no reliable person could be found among thelocal inhabitants,   should recourse be had to persons brought from outside to fill localGovernment posts in the occupied territory.The War Cabinet -Expressed general approval of the line taken in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s draft reply,  and authorised him to despatchthe reply, subject to amendment inthe light of&apos;the points brought out indiscussionu      In particular, it wasagreed that the first two lines ofthe draft telegram required amendment.Offices of the War Cabinet,S e W * 1 e ,21st May, 19430-2-
