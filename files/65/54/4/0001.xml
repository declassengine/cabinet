The powers and privilegesof Parliament must be carefully safeguarded, an., there could, be no question of their powers being taken away byde facto action.      Moreover, the Viceroy1s position in negotiation would be further strengthened if he was in aposition to say that he was not empowered to do anything which might limit the powers ofAfter discussion,  the.

It was suggested,  on the other hand, that nothing short of legislation could formally limit.thepowers and responsibilities of the House of Commons,whatever conventions might develop in practice.lord-WAVSLL said that he would much prefer to&apos; see thesetwo paragraphs omitted from the statement.       fie was reluctant ,to see anything included which would suggestthat his powers were undergoing any change, since thiswould make the task of handling his Council still moredifficult.

It wan suggested that it would be desirable toavoid any commitment on this point and to leave theViceroy&apos;s freedom of choice entirely unfettered.      THE VICEROYagreed,  and undertook to amend his broadcast accordingly.(b) TIE) VICEROY said that he would like to discuss withhis present Council the tactics to be adopted as regards therelease of members of the Congress V/or king Committee whowere still under detention at the opening of the conference which he had in view.      It was the view of the Cabinetthat the Viceroy should have discretion,  subject to theviews of his Council,  to release members of the working committee still in detention on that date, but that theremaining detainees should not bo released until the newGovernments at the Centre and in the Provinces wore in powerand had agreed to their release.Tii-j PRIME MINISTER summing up  uhe discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were greatly indebted to the Viceroyfor his assistance and for the full explanation which he had given of the procedure which he proposed to adopt in dealingwith this matter.

1.     During the recent visit of Field-Marshal Viscount Wave11 tothis country His Majesty&apos;s Government reviewed with him a numberof problems and discussed particularly the present politicals i tuati on in India.2.      Members will be aware that since the offer by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to India in March 19k2 there has been no further progress towards the solution of the Indian constitutional problem,3.     As was then stated, the working out of India&apos;s new constitutional system is a task which can only be carried throughby the Indian peoples themselves.k.     While His Majesty&apos;,s Government are at all times most anxiousto do their utmost to assist the Indians in the working out of anew constitutional settlement, it would be a contradiction interms to speak of the imposition &quot;by this country of self-governing institutions upon an unwilling India.     Such a thing is notpossible, nor could we accept the responsibility for enforcingsuch institutions at the very time when we were, by its purpose,withdrawing from all control of British Indian affairs.5.     The main constitutional position remains therefore as it was.The offer of March 191.1-2 stands in its entirety without change orqualification.     His Majesty&apos;s Government still hope that thepolitical leaders in India may &quot;be able to come to an agreement asto the procedure whereby India&apos;s permanent future form of govern-ment can be determined,6,     His Majesty&apos;s Government are, however, most anxious to makeany contribution that is practicable to the breaking of thepolitical deadlock in India.     While that deadlock lasts not onlypolitical but social and economic progress is being hampered.7.     The Indian administration,  over-burdened-with the greattasks laid upon it by the war against Japan and by the planning for the post-war period, is further strained by the politicaltension that exists.8.     All that is so urgently required to be done for agricultural and industrial development and for the peasants and workers ofIndia cannot be carried through unless the whole-hearted-operation of every community and section of the Indian people is forthcoming.9.     His Majesty5s Government have therefore considered whether there is something which they could suggest in this interim period, under the existing constitution, pending the formulationby Indians of their future constitutional&quot; arrangements, whichwould enable the main communities and parties to co-operatemore closely together and with the British to the benefit of thepeople of India as a whole.10.    It is not the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government tointroduce any change contrary to the wishes of the major Indiancommunities.     But they are willing&apos; to make possible some step forward during the Interim period if the leaders of the principalIndian parties are prepared to agree to their suggestions and toco-operate in the successful conclusion of the war against Japan-as well as in the reconstruction in&apos;India which must follow thefinal victory.-1-;    APPENDIX &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;Revised Draft of Statement to &quot;be made in Parliament bythe Secretary of State for India

II. To&quot;this end they would he prepin the composition of the Viceroy&apos;swithout making- any ^change in the ej;one amendment to the Ninth Schedule(... Schedule contains a provision thatthe Executive must have had at leasGrown in India. If the proposalHouse meet with acceptance in Indiahe amended, to dispense with that reared&quot;to Bee an important changeExecutive..    This is possible:.i.sting statute law except for to the Act of 193.5.     that not less than three members oft 10 years&apos;  service under theI am about to lay before the,  that clause would have toquirement.12.    It is proposed that the Executive Council should be recon-stituted and that the Viceroy should in future make his selectionfor nomination to the Crown for appointment to his Executive fromamongst leaders of Indian political life at the Centre and in theProvinces;, in proportions which would give a balanced represent-ation of the main communities, including equal proportions ofMoslems and Caste Hindus.13.    In orderpursue this object,  the Viceroy will call intoconference a number of leading Indian politicians who are the heads of the most important parties or who have had recent experience as Prime Ministers of Provinces, together with a few-others of special experience and authority.     The Viceroy intends to put before this conference the proposal that the ExecutiveCouncil should be reconstituted as above stated and to invitefrom the members of the conference a list of nam.es.     Out of thesehe would hope to be able to choose the future members whom hewould recommend for appointment by His Majesty to the Viceroy&apos;council, although the responsibility for the recommendations mustof course continue to rest with him, and his freedom of choicetherefore remains unrestricted.ILj..    The members of his Council who are chosen as a result of thisarrangement would of course accept the position on the basis thatthey would whole-heartedly co-operate in supporting and carrying through the war against Japan to its victorious conclusion.15.    The members of the Executive would be Indians with theexception of the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief, who would retain his position as War Member.     This is essential so long asthe defence of India remains a British responsibility.16, Nothing contained in any o:relations of the Crown with theas Crown Representative.r these proposals will affect theIndian States through the Viceroy17. The Viceroy has been author!to place this proposal before thehis return to India. His Majestleaders of the Indian communitiesof such a plan must depend upon idegree to which responsible India,co-operate with the object of makarrangement. In the absence ofarrangements must necessarily cony&apos;sed by His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentIndian Leaders immediately upons Government trust that the will respond.     For the successts acceptance in India and then politicians are prepared toing it a workable interimsuch general acceptance existingtinue .18..  If such co-operation can be achieved at the Centre it will no doubt be reflected in the Provinces and so enable responsibleGovernments to bo set ujowing to the withdrawalit became necessary to putonce again in those Provinces where,f the majority party from participation,into force the powers.of the Governorsunder Section 93 of the Act of 1935.      It is to be honed that inall the Provinces these Governments would be based on the((-participation of the main parties, thus smoothing out communaldifferences and allowing Ministers to. concentrate upon their very heavy administrative tasks.-2-

19.    There is one further change which) if-these proposals are accepted, His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest should follow,20.    That is,  that External Affairs (other than those tribaland frontier matters which fall to be dealt with as part ofthe defence of India) should be placed in the charge of an indian Member of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive so far as british india is concerned,  and that fully accredited representativesshall be appointed for the representation of India abroad.21.    By their acceptance of and co-operation in this scheme the Indian leaders will not only be able to make their immediatecontribution to the direction of Indian affairs, but it is alsoto be hoped that their experience &apos;of co-operation in governmentwill expedite agreement between them as to the method of working out the new&apos;constitutional arrangements.22.    His Majesty&apos;s Government consider, after the most careful study of the question, that the plan now suggested gives theutmost progress practicable within the present constitution.None of the changes suggested will in any way prejudice orprejudge the essential form of the future permanent constitutionor constitutions for India.23.    His Majesty&apos;s Government feel certain, that given goodwill and a genuine desire to co-operate on all sides, both Britishand Indian, these proposals can mark a genuine step forward inthe collaboration of the British and Indian peoples towardsIndian self-government and can assert the rightful position,and strengthen the influence,  of India in the counsels of thenations.
