CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE kConfidential Annex(20th June, 1945 - 11.30 a,in.)THREE-POWER THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that, when he hadMEETING agreed to meet President Truman and Marshal Stalin on15th July (-ten days before the results of the General(Previous Election would be known), he had been proceeding on reference; the assumption that on foreign policy there was noC.M.(h5) 8th      divergence of view between the Government and the LabourConclusions,       Party, and. that he would be able - particularly if, as&apos;Minute 1) he had proposed, Mr. Attlee accompanied him to the5, meeting -- to speak with the assurance that, whatever the results of the Election,  the next Government wouldhonour any commitments which he entered into on mattersof foreign policy.      His confidence had, however, beenshaken by the statements made by Professor Laski, as chairman of the Executive Committee of the SocialistParty. &quot; Professor Laski1s first statement, thatMr. Attlee would attend the Three-Power meeting only asan observer, had. been neutralised by the subsequentcorrespondence with Mr. Attlee, in which the latter had rejected the suggestion that he would attend only as an observer and had accepted the offer to go as a&quot;friend and counsellor&quot;.      After this correspondenceProfessor Laski had withdrawn his suggestion thatMr. Attlee would be no more than an observer.   . He had,however, persisted in the more serious suggestion that  .there would not be continuity of foreign policy between this Government and a Labour Government;    for he had repeated his statement on this point since the .publication of the correspondence, without drawing anyprotest or disagreement from Mr. Attlee.     While,therefore,  the Prime Minister did not believe thatthere was In fact any divergence of view on matters offoreign policy between the present Government and theLabour Ministers who had been members of the coalition government, he could not be sure how far the foreignpolicy of a Labour Government would be determined by the Iex-Labour Ministers,  or how far it would be dictated by.  the Executive Committee of the Socialist Party.      If,therefore, the Three-Power meeting were held before theresults of the General Election were known, he wouldnot feel that the integrity of his position would be assured, . even though Mr. Attlee were present with him at the meeting.&quot;In these circumstances he wondered whether itmight not be preferable to postpone the meeting until^it could be attended by a Prime Minister who would have- a clear mandate from the country,. and whose right toK^J speak on behalf of the British people was-beyond doubtor challenge.      If the present Government were returnedat the Election, with a clear majority over the other two Parties,  it, vymild be possible for him to go. to a

Three-Power meeting immediately after the debate on the address - say, about 15th August.      If,- on the otherhand, the present Government failed to obtain a clear majority, he would propose to meet the new Parliament.There would then be a trial of strength between theParties.      If his administration were defeated on an. amendment to the Address,  there would have to be an interval during which Mr. Attlee would form a new government, and that Government would have to giveParliament an opportunity to debate a statement ofits policy.      On that hypothesis, it seemed unlikelythat the new Prime Minister would be able to leave thecountry to attend a Throe-Power meeting before20th August at the very earliest.       It was, however,conceivable that the new Foreign Secretary mightrepresent the British Government at a Three-power meeting and that&quot;, if he felt able to leave beforeParliament had debated the policy of the new Government,he could attend a meeting commencing on or about15th August.The Prime Minister said that he had been considering whether in these circumstances it wouldbe reasonable to suggest that the Three-Power meeting might be postponed until 15th,  or perhaps 20th, August.It was conceivable that Marshal Stalin might prefer alater date:    he had recently found it necessary to propose that the withdrawal of the armies to the agreed Zones of Occupation should be delayed from21 st June to 1 st July,  and that would be a suitablepeg on which to hang the suggestion that the Three- \Power meeting might also be deferred.      But, before any approach was made to Marshal Stalin,  it would benecessary to ascertain President Truman&apos;s views;    andit might be inexpedient to put the suggestion to marshal Stalin if President Truman were strongly opposedto postponement.The Prime Minister said that at an earlier stagehe had favoured a meeting before 15th July:    but manyof the problems which had then called for earlydiscussion had become less urgent in the meantime.Thus,  the situation in Venezia Giulia and Carinthia was much less acute than it had been a month ago:    therewere various indications that the Russians were beginning to withdraw some of their troops across their pre-war western frontiers:    and the deadlock over there constitution of the Polish Government had been resolved to the extent.that discussions had now begun in Moscow.THE PERMANENT UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FORFOREIGN AFFAIRS confirmed that, from the point of viewof the Foreign Office, there was no serious objectionto delaying for about a month the discussion of thepolitical problems which awaited consideration at aThree-Power meeting.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had asked theChiefs of Staff to consider whether there would bo any military objection to postponement.      The Chiefs ofStaff had informed him that they would not wish toraise objection on military grounds   though the continuation, until after an August meeting? of thepresent standstill order&apos; in respect of demobilisation and re-deployment might be embarrassing, especially forthe Royal Air Force.     He himself thought that it mightbe possible to relax this standstill order in advanceof the discussions at a Three-Power meeting.-2-

Cabinet Office, S.W.1.,20th June, 1945.-3-THE PRIMS MINISTER then read to the Cabinetdrafts of the telegrams which he would propose to send,in the first instance to President Truman and thereafter to Marshal Stalin, if he decided to put forward thesuggestion that the Three-Power meeting should be deferred.      He had read these over earlier in the day to the Foreign Secretary, who was inclined to favourpostponement.      In discussion two suggestions were madeon the terms of these drafts:-(a) It was important that the telegrams should not give any impression that the present Government thoughtit likely that they would not be in power after theElection.(b) The present Government could not properlycommit a different Government to attendance at a Three-Power meeting on a specified date.     For this reason it would be preferable that the telegrams should put this point on the basis that it seemed unlikely that,if there should be a change of Government, a new PrimeMinister would be able to attend a Three-Power meetingbefore about 20th August.At the conclusion of the discussion, THE PRIMEMINISTER said that, before finally deciding whether tomake this suggestion to President Truman, he would, wait until he knew what passed at the meeting of theExecutive Committee of the Socialist Party which was tobe held on the following day.      If, as a result ofthat meeting, the Socialist Party made a publicrepudiation of the attitude adopted by Professor Laski,or withdrew the suggestion that there was a divergence of view between the present Government and theSocialist Party on questions of foreign policy, he might feel able to go forward with the present plans for holding the Three-Power meeting in July - though,even- so, he would find it embarrassing to be present at such a meeting on 2bth July, viz. the da5^ duringwhich the results of the Election would be becomingknown.     If, on the other hand, the Socialist Party didnothing to modify the public- impression that theywould not seek to secure continuity of foreign policyif they were returned to power after the Election, he felt that he ought to suggest to President Truman thaton this account there would be great advantage inpostponing the Three-Power meeting until 15th, or perhaps 20th, August.The Cabinet endorsed the views expressed bythe Prime Minister.
