While he was ready to give&apos;full weight to the importance of a non-party approach which would prevent the Indian problem,from becoming an issue of political controversy at theGeneral Election, he would deprecate any hasty decision in a matter of such grave constitutional importance.. Would it not be wiser to inform the Viceroy that these issues must, stand over until after the General Election,when they could be considered by a new Government and anew Parliament?THE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR INDIA said that he waspersuaded that there was a sound case on the merits,  apartfrom any electoral considerations, for going ahead on thebasis of the India Committee&apos;s proposals.
