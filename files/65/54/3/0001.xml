(45)12nd Conclusions,minute 2)tTHE PRIME MINISTER thanked the Viceroyfor attending to give the Cabinet the benefit ofhis views on the Indian constitutional problem.putnotfutureThe Cabinet had considered the proposalsforward by the India Committee, but they were satisfied as to the wisdom of making a freshoffer to India on the lines proposed.     Admittedlythere would be advantages in removing India from thefield of political controversy at the GeneralElection by announcing proposals which had been worked out under the Coalition Government.      TheCabinet must first, however, be satisfied that thescheme was sound on its merits.      It this plan were .accepted and put into effect, was there not some risk that it might reduce the standing, authority and competence of the Governor-General1s ExecutiveCouncil?     Might it not even prove to be a retrograde step from the point of view of putting the Governmentof India on a democratic basis if, as a result ofthe composition of the new Executive Council, mattersof the highest secrecy and importance tended into be handled independently by the Viceroy and commander-in-Chief?     Was it likely that theseproposals would be accepted by public opinion as aworthy contribution towards the solution of India&apos;constitutional problem?     There were great reformsto be undertaken in India.     We v/ere ourselvesperhaps open to criticism on the ground that we.hadnot tackled them with sufficient resolution.    . but would the elements now proposed to be brought intothe Viceroy&apos; s&quot; Council be those needed to deal-with problems, or would they rather be what he mightas factionaries?     The Cabinet would greatly valuean expression of the Viceroy&apos;s views both on the merits of the plan and on the procedure which he hadin mind for giving effect to these proposals.LORD WAVELL recalled, that on his appointment as Viceroy he had been instructed to consider what progress could be made towards a solution of theconstitutional problem in India, and to make recommendations to His Majesty&apos;s Government at theend of twelve or eighteen months.     He^reviewed the origin   of his present proposals, which had. been framed after discussions with Governors and withsenior European officials, and said that since the-1-thosedescribe

beginning of this year he had felt bound -to press for their early consideration by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.      The end of the war in Europe was then in sight and he had thought this would be afavourable opportunity to try to break the politicaldeadlock in India:     he had also thought that thefall of Rangoon might make the situation morefavourable as it would remove the last apprehensionof enemy attack on India:      and, finally, there wouldhave been advantages in obtaining a decision by a coalition Government which would have avoided political controversy over India at a General Election.He did not under-rate the difficulties ofcarrying through the proposals which he had &quot;putforward, but he thought that the present situ at ionwas still not unfavourable and that any other course,including that of making no move, would be more dangerous.      The advantages of the course which hehad recommended,  as amended by the India Committee,were that the new Council would be a body with some sort of popular support, if chosen in the manner which hewas about to describe;    and that,  if the experimentsucceeded, it would, in his judgment, be accepted asa substantial step forward by opinion in India and outside.      If it failed,&apos;we should have the advantageof having made the most generous offer that circumstances would permit.      He believed that bythe .methods which he proposed it should be possibleto secure a Council which would not be inferior inintellectual quality to the present Council andwould, conduct itself in a reasonable manner, thoughadmittedly it would be more difficult to handle andmore nationalist in temperament.The procedure which he had in mind was toput his proposals to the present Executive Council,immediately upon his return to India, and cabletheir views for consideration by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.      He would then announce his proposals in a broadcast in India, on the same date as theSecretary of State made his statement in Parliament.Thereafter he would summon a conference comprising the present Provincial Premiers, the individuals who last served as Premiers in the Provinces nowadministered under Section 93 of the Act of 1935,the leaders of Congress and the Muslim League inthe Legislative Assembly and the Council of State,the leader of the Independent Party in the Assembly,the two senior Indian members of his Council(Sir R. Mudaliar and Sir Sultan Ahmed), Gandhi,Jinnah, Dr. Ambedkar representing the depressed classes,  and Master Tara Singh representing theSikhs.This conference of twenty-two persons would be representative of all the main sectionsof Indian opinion and would have substantial popularinfluence behind it.     At least fourteen of its members would have held high administrative office for a number of years.      Its composition would be approximately nine Hindu&apos;, six Muslim and seven-2-

falling outside those Categories.      There would beno.question of negotiating with this conference onthe offer itself.      If they were not prepared toco-operate on the basis of his proposals, he would report their attitude to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand &quot;would advise that no further concessions shouldbe offered..      If, however,  they were ready to co-operate, he would ask them to advisee him on the selection of individuals to form his new Council,viz.,  to put forward names from which he couldselect those whom he would recommend to HisMajesty&apos;s Government for appointment.      He would urgethem to make a substantially larger number ofnominations than there would be vacancies.      He woulddeem himself entirely free to reject,  to select, to choose from outside the names put forward, and ofcourse to choose from outside the membership of theconference.After explaining his proposals to theconference and hearing their views, he would askhow they wished to proceed in the discussion of possiblenames for his consideration.       They would probablysplit into Hindu and Muslim groups and put forwardseparate lists.      In dealing with the recommendations made to him, he would aim at avoiding head-oncollisions over individuals, but would point outthe objections to one or the advantages of another,and might in addition be prepared to put forwardindependent proposals of his own.      He hoped for,and it would be his object to attain, an ExecutiveCouncil composed,  in addition to the Viceroy andthe Commander-in-Chief, of four Congress and onenon-Congress Hindus: four Muslim League and onenon-Muslim League Muslims:      one Scheduled Caste(Dr. Ambedkar):    one Sikh, and perhaps one other -a total of fifteen, of which only four would bedrawn from the Congress.The Viceroy added that he would resist anyattempt by the conference to enlarge their numbers.Finally, he recognised that he would be faced witha demand that,  in view of these discussions, theremaining members of the Congress Working Committeeshould be released from detention.      On this he proposed to consult his Executive Council;    and ifthey thought release advisable he would recommendthat these persons should be released as soon asthe conference assembled.In discussion the following points weremade -(a) The scheme put forward by the Viceroy inthe discussions had not been explained to the india committee in detail;    and the detailed scheme,particularly   the procedure which he was proposing tofollow, put his proposals in a new light.(b) It was important that in any statement tobe published it should be made clear that the Viceroywould be free to reject the recommendations made bythe conference for appointments to the Executive

Council, and to go outside any lists submitted bythe conference.      What was essentially involved was an extension and formalisation of the.adviceavailable to the Viceroy in selecting the members ofhis Council.(c) Was there not a risk that.Congress andthe Muslim League groups would start by asking whether the Viceroy would accept their recommendations,and would break off the discussions as soon as theywere told that no such assurance could be given.LORD WAVELL thought this was unlikely.(d) A great deal would depend on the extent ofthe desire in India to escape from the present political deadlock.      If this desire was strong,progress might be made on the lines indicated by theViceroy.    LORD WAVELL said that he thought therewas a very strong wish on the part of Indianpoliticians to get back into office in the Provinces,and he hoped that for that reason they might be themost anxious to. co-operate in his scheme.      Hishoxje was that the Provincial Governments would be re-formed at the same time as the Government at thecentre was reconstituted.After further discussion, THE PRIME ministers aid that the explanations which the Viceroy had givenhad greatly clarified the position and had gone far toremove the misgivings which he had felt about theproposals as presented in the Report of the india committee.      It was now clear that the Viceroy wouldbe free to reject, to select, and to use his influence as he thought fit, in dealing with theproposals made to him by the conference regardingthe persons whom he might recommend for appointment to his Executive Council;    and the effect of thescheme, as now explained, was to give the Viceroyrather1- more guidance, and to ensure that a widersurvey was made of the field of choice, before his council was formed.There could be no question of introducingbefore the General Election amending legislation toremove the official element from the ExecutiveCouncil.      Nor should any public reference be madeat this stage to further Indianisation of the indian army:      that was a matter which.must be reservedfor consideration by the new Government.     Finally,it must be clear that the offer which was to be madeto the conference was not open to extension by negotiation:      if the conference was not ready toproceed on the. offer as it stood,  the project mustbe dropped.      Subject to these three points, however, hewas disposed to favour the acceptance of the proposals,which the Viceroy had explained to the Cabinet.As regards the release of persons still under detention, he thought that the Viceroy might be givendiscretion to deal with this question on the lines whichhe had Indicated in the discussion.It was, however, necessauy that the IndialilltSg WMM :&apos;.V-:-.:&apos;;.;&quot;V:&apos;- &apos;

Committee should consider how the draft statement annexed to their Report (W.P.(45)  274) should be adjusted to conform with the detailed explanationwhich the Viceroy had now given of the procedure by which he would handle these proposals;    and hesuggested that the Committee should meet forthwith to review the position in the light of the Viceroy&apos;sstatement.The Cabinet -Invited the India Committee to review the position, as suggestedby the Prime Minister, and toreport immediately what adjustmentsshould be made in the draft statement annexed to W.P.(45) 274 in order tobring that statement into conformitywith the further explanations whichthe Viceroy had given to the Cabinet.\Cabinet Office, S.W.V.  1.5\
