MINUTE .3.Confidential Annex.(18th September, 1941 - 12 Noon.)MIDDLE EAST.Military-Situation:australian troops.(previous reference:W.M.(41) 93rdConclusions,Minute 3.)THE PRIME MINISTER said that he hadreceived a disturbing telegram (No. 2907&quot;of 17thSeptember) from the Minister of State saying thatGeneral Auchinleck was perturbed by the australian government&apos;s insistence that their troops should be withdrawn from Tobruk.      The General had gone so far*as to prepare a telegram asking to be relieved ofhis command, as the Australian refusal to allow their troops to remain in Tobruk was based on military andnot political grounds.      It seemed that the telegramfrom the Australian Government had followed onewhich they had received from General Blarney, and whichthe latter had not shown to the Commander-in-Chief.General Auchinleck also thought that perhaps HisMajesty&apos;s Government endorsed the opposite militaryview to his own.     This view was, of course,erroneous.      The Minister of State had persuadedGeneral Auchinleck not to send the telegram.The Prime Minister then read to the WarCabinet a telegram (No. 094)&apos;which he had sent tothe Commander-in-Chief to the effect that the Cabinet,himself and the Chiefs of Staff entirely endorsedhis military views in this matter and had beenconfident that the Australian Government would regard them as decisive.     He should, however makeallowance for the political situation in Australia.The Prime Minister had ended up by assuring GeneralAuchinleok of our sympathy and confidence and asking him to have patience.     The prime Minister addedthat at the proper time it would be necessary toinform the Australian Government of this difficultywe had had with the Commander-in-Chief. -     It alsomight be desirable to find a relief for General Blarney.

COPY.(This telegram is of particular secrecy and shouldhe retained hy the authorised recipient and not passed on.)(Cypher)MINISTER OF STATE (NOCOP^.PROM CAIRO TO FOREIGN OFFICE.Sir M. LampsonNo. 3907.17th September, 1941.R.    12.30 a.m. 18th September, 1941.D.12.05 a.m. 17th September, 1941.MOST IMMEDIATE.Following for Prime Minister from Minister of State.Most Secret and Personal.I think you should know that the result of exchangeswith Australian Government concerning relief of 9th Australiandivision has greatly perturbed Auchinleck.     He showed me atelegram last night in which he asked to he relieved of his command and stating that he made this request only after 24hours reflection.      I persuaded him not to send it because i feel strongly as you do that in him we have art excellentcommander and I feel sure that the battle will prove you tobe right.2.     Auchinleck stated that if the Australian Governmenthad based their request on political grounds he would have had nothing to say but to reject his advice on purely military grounds when separated from the ttheatre of war by 10,000miles strikes at roots of his military authority.     Isympathise with his view though it may be somewhat overstressed.3.     His reasons are:-   Firstly.     Blarney admits thattelegram of Australian Government largely follows the onewhich he himself sent but which he will not show to Auchinleck.Secondly.   Blarney has really produced no sound military reasonsfor taking up this attitude.     Thirdly.    It crosses Auchinleck&apos;mind that His Majesty&apos;s Government endorse opposite vieWto hisown.     On this I have reassured him pointing out that you would not have transmitted his views verbatim without thinkingthem sound.4.     I think I must add my own views on this ratherdelicate matter.     I would suggest that if you feel able todo so you should send Auchinleck a telegram saying that youpersonally regard his military reasons as sound but that HisMajesty&apos;s Government has no alternative but to acceptAustralian Government&apos;s request which you.,believe to be (groupundec.) political fears or in other words that you and he arein the same boat.     Again I would feel inclined to suggestinformal message should be made to Australian Governmentsuggesting the replacement of Blarney whose conduct I regard asweak and disingenuous.     This last point I can very welldiscuss with you in London.-1-

5.     Nature clearly never moulded Blarney to be a Eugenebut I frankly fear that unless we are careful he may play the role of a (2 groups undecipherable) in future (group undecypherable ) movement.

Prime Minister to General Auchinleck.PERSONAL AND SECRET.Minister of State tells me you are distressed by australian attitude and Blarney&apos;s conduct.     I therefore assureyou that the Chiefs of the Staff entirely endorse the militaryviews expressed in your 1558 of 10.9.41.     So do Cabinet and I.We telegraphed this to Australia feeling confidentthey would accept it as decisive.     Great allowances must bemade, for a Government with a majority of one playing politicswith a bitter Opposition, part of whom at least areisolationist in sentiment.     Whatever your and our personalfeelings may be, it is our duty at all costs to prevent an opendispute with the Australian Government.     Any public controversywould injure foundations of Empire and be disastrous to our general position in the war.     Everything must be borne withpatience, and in the end all will come right.     You. have all our sympathy and confidence.C.4. (Telegrams).Copies to:-   S. of S.    (6 copies)Lt. Col. Jacob. (5 copies).

Stalin saying that the HarrimanMission and ourselves were now engaged on working out a programme&apos;of monthly deliveries to Russia andthat the Joint Mission hoped to arriva \-y the 25thSeptember.     In this telegram the Prime Minister saidthat he had also referred to the importance of the route through Persia and had said that the possibilitieof military co-operation with the Russians on theirsouthern front werebeing examined by our military advisers.    He had also referred to the importance to turkey.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had seen M. Maisky on the previous day and he had stated that the Russians were most anxious for help on their southern front,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the possibilityof helping them here would have to be examined.    Theposition   would, of course, be much easier if theposition on our .western flank in Libya was cleared.A move in this direction would greatly impress theTurks.     The Russians should realise, however, thatif there was a large British force in the Caucasus,that would largely occupy the capacity of the Trans-Persian railway, and would diminish the flow ofsupplies to Russia by that route.     It was also important that M. Stalin should realise the importanceof our supplying Turk*ey with as much material aspossible. &quot;  If we sent everything to Russia we mightdiscourage the Turks from coming in on our side*THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY said that in thediscussions that wei?e now going on with the americans regarding supplies, the American attitude had been stiff and even harsho     Personal relationshad, however, at all times been friendly,     Theextent of material which the United states authorities now proposed to retain for their own forces was discouraging.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it must beremembered that until Kussia entered the war we had expected to receive ourselves the whole extrr stablesurplus of American supplies.     Now that Russia wasin the war we should have to make sacrifices.     Wecould only hope that, under pressure from us, the

-jjjrcraft and tanks.Raw Materials.Machine Tools.Americans would make further efforts to increase their-production.     He thought it would be a good thing if,when final figures had been arrived at as to what theRussians were to receive, they could be presented in a form which showed, broadly, equal contributions from the Americans and from ourselves.THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY then gave full details of the position in respect of aircraft and tanks, and explained the basis on which the UnitedStates Government proposed to divide United Statesproduction between the United Kingdom, the U.S.S.R.,China and themselves.      (A full statement of theposition, and of the action which the Minister ofSupply proposed should be taken, is contained inD.0.(41) 11).In raw materials the United States werenot sending Russia much, apart from oil, at thepresent time.     Later on the raw materials situation might improve.His colleagues must prepare themselves fora set-back on the machine tool front.     Two Americanmachine tool experts were now inspecting theposition in this country;      it must be taken ascertain that they would report unfavourably on theuse we were making of the machine tools we&quot; had&apos;obtained from America.     They were likely to find,broadly speaking, that machine tools were beinginsufficiently used owing to the difficulty of arranging night shifts.     They were also likelyto report that in some cases factories were equipped with an excessive number of machine tools.In all probability the result would be areduction in the supply of machine tools from theUnited States.The War Cabinet; -Invited the Minister of Supplyand the Minister of Labour and national &quot;Service to considerwhether the forthcoming reportby the United States machine tool experts could be turned togood advantage, and used to*e our industrialists.

Impossible that Auchinleck should suppose we do not agreewith him.     My whole series of telegrams, including especially mineof September 11th to Fadden which was repeated to Auchinleck, andis now repeated to you herewith, shows how strongly we deprecateAustralian resolve to quit the line at this juncture.

It is imperative that no public dispute should arise between Great Britain and Australia.     All personal feelings must therefore be subordinated to appearance of unity.
