MINUTE 2*......Confidential Annex.(4th September, 1941 - 11.30 a.mOT.)60PERSIA.(previous reference:W.M.(41) 88thConclusions?Minute 6.)THE PRIME MINISTER said that Persia was now entirely in our hands, and it was clear that wemust extend the scope of our original demands.     Itwas important that we should have complete controlover Persia during the war, and more especially ofthe road and railway communications to Russia.     Theprevious day he (the Prime Minister) had discussed the best methods for developing the railway systemsin the Middle East, so that they could not onlysupport our Armies hut enable us to increase throughtraffic to Russia.     As a result of this discussion,arrangements had been made for increasing the engines and rolling stock available.      These arrange-ments were being supervised by the Ministers ofSupply and War Transport.      It would seem, therefore,that when our Mission left at the end of the month for Moscow under the Minister of Supply (who would for the time being toe in charge of all the non-diplomatic Missions in Russia) we should have some-thing concrete to offer in the way of deliveriesover the railway through Persia, as well asdeliveries from the United States toy Vladivostok.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet atelegram (No.619)rwhich had been sent to Sir R.* Bullard(Teheran) setting out our policy, as summarised above.Reference was made to Telegram No. 5 fromKermanahah, of 2nd September, which referred to theindiscipline now prevailing in the Persian Army-In the light of the possibility that our troops would be required to maintain order in parts of persia, the War Cabinet: -Agreed that the orders for themovement of three British Battalionsto Fersia should not, for the moment,be countermanded.

WAR CABINET DISTRIBUTION.TO:   PERSIA.FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO TEHRAN.Sir R. Bullard. D. 11.05 p.m. 3rd September, 1941.No. 619.5rd September, 1941cBMEDL1TE./////PERSONAL AND SECRET.Following from Prime Minister.1.   Your various telegrams.    Dismiss from your mind any idea of a generous policy towards.the Germans to please the persians or anyone else.    We respect diplomatic immunity, but even that is to bo subject to a proper   treatment of Sir LancelotOliphant now being held by the enemy.     You will receive special instructions on this point from the Foreign Office.    We haveprotested against&apos;the Turks taking over the care of German or italian interests, and if they do we shall transact no business with them on such subjects.2.   Your No. 657 referring to&apos; War Office 87294, the policy set out by the Chiefs of the Staff is approved.    Paragraphs 2and 3 fall under the head of &quot;facilities-&apos; which will bedrastically interpreted.    We cannot tell how the war in these regions will develop, but the best possible through-route fromthe Persian Gulf to the Caspian will be developed at the utmostspeed and at all costs in order to supply Russia.     It is very likely that large British forces will be operating in and from persia in 1942 and certainly a powerful Air Force will beinstalled. ..       .....5.   We hope it will not be necessary in the present phaseat any rate to have an Anglo-Russian occupation of Tehran, butthe Persian Government will have to give us loyal and faithfulhelp and show all proper alacrity, if they wish to avoid it.At the present time we have not turned against the Shah but unlessfood results are forthcoming his mis-government of his people wille brought into the account.    Although we should like to get what we want by agreement with the Persian Government, and do not wishto drive them into active hostility, our requirements must some-how be met, and it ought to be possible for you to   obtain all thefacilities we require, bit by bit, by using the leverage of apossible Russian occupation of Tehran.     There is no need to fearundue Russian encroachments as their one supreme wish will be toget the through-route for American supplies.     The fact that the mufti has escaped from Persian surveillance is much to be .regretted.     His capture, dead or alive, is an important object,of which the Persian Government should be made to feel theimportance.[Copies sent to the Prime Minister].
