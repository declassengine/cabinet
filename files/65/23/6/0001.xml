(41)  77th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.(4th August, 1941, 5.0 p.m.)THE FOREIGN SECRETARY summarised the upshot ofthe secret conversations which had been proceeding with the Portuguese Government since December, 1940,with a view to clarifying the position in the eventof a German attack on Portugal,    (in this connection the War Cabinet had before them an un-numberedMemorandumTprepared in the Foreign Office dealing withthis matter.)The outstanding point was as follows.    On the50th May last we had made it clear that we could not offer the Portuguese effective assistance in thedefence of the mainland, and had made a certain offer to them if they moved their seat of Government to thePortuguese Atlantic Islands  &quot;as soon as Portugal wasthreat ened&quot;.The Portuguese, in reply, had accepted our offer,but had made their move to the Azores conditional,not on a threat to Portugal, but upon &quot;an attack onthe Portuguese mainland by Germany with or without the collaboration of any\   other country and.....Portugueseinability to resist&quot;.The Chiefs of Staffs had pointed out that this didnot satisfy our point of view, since the portuguese government would not be bound to move to   the islandsif German action,, in the Peninsula was restricted to spain.   We might thus lose the use of Gibraltar withoutgetting the use of alternative bases in the Atlantic IslandsHe (the Foreign Secretary), however, foresaw that dr. Salazar would have great difficulty in acceptingour proposal, which, he would contend, would amount to an act of provocation to Germany at a time when  germany had invaded Spain but not Portugal.In the circumstances, the Foreign secretary thought that the best plan would be to put the whole matter before Sir Ronald Campbell and to invite his views as to the best method of handling the matter.A draft telegramfto this end had been circulated to theWar Cabinet.   When Sir Ronald&apos;s views had beenreceived, he thought the best plan would be to have avery frank talk with Dr. Monteiro, who was a goodfriend to this  country.The War Cab inet:-Invited the Foreign Secretary toproceed on the lines proposed.3-reat George Street, S.W.I.

Portuguese Atlantic Islands.Notes for the Secretary.of State for Cabinet meeting on 4th August.Secret conversations have been proceeding with thePortuguese Government since last December with a view toclarifying the position in the event of a German attack onPortugal.The background to these conversations is as followsi-(l) At the beginning of the war it was agreed between his Majesty&apos;s&apos;Government and the Portuguese Government thatthe maintenance of Portuguese neutrality was in their mutual ;interest, and that the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance should notbe invoked.      This still remains a British interest unless and until the Iberian Peninsula is dragged into the war.(2) After the collapse of Prance and the consequentpotential threat to Gibraltar, the Chiefs of Staff consideredplans for seizing the Portuguese Atlantic Islands to providealternative &quot;bases for Gibraltar and to deny them to the enemy.The strongest arguments a gainst such action haWbeen (a) thegood prospects of obtaining the use of these Islands inagreement with the Portuguese Government at the appropriate moment and (h) the importance of not precipitating a Germanentry into the Peninsula by our own action.(3) For some years past we have been unable to meetrepeated Portuguese demands for military material, and thePortuguese mainland is therefore virtually defenceless.As a result of a Portuguese suggestion in December, 1940,Anglo-Portuguese staff conversations were held in London inMarch, 1941.      The opportunity was taken to introduce thequestion of the Portuguese Atlantic Islands with the resultthat the Portuguese Government have since concentrated uponimproving the defence of the Islands rather than of the mainland.      During these conversations we offered thePortuguese military material and the assistance of technical personnel for the defence of the Islands.     On 30th May, amemorandum was handed to the Portuguese Ambassador in which we made it clear that we could not offer the Portuguese any effective assistance for the defence of the mainland......   Wetherefore advised them only to offer a token resistance there and to.move their seat of Government to the Islands &quot;as soon&quot;as Portugal was threatened&quot;.      If the Portuguese agreed tothis we offered(i) our help in transferring the Government to the azores 1(ii) early delivery of 24 heavy and 36 light A.A.  gunswith the technical assistance necessary to instal them;(iii) technicians to assist in improving the localaerodrome; -&quot;:V .. -   * (iv)/ ;

(iv) naval defence equipment for the Azores and somecoast defence guns for the Cape Verdes.On 10th July, the Portuguese Government accepted our offer   in substance, although deeply regretting the necessityffor abandoning the mainland.      However they made their/agreement.&apos;to move to the Azores conditional, not upon a threatIto Portugal, which had been our proposal,, but upon &quot;an attackI &quot;on the Portuguese mainland by Germany with or without theI &quot;collaboration of another country and .... Portuguese inabilit$i &quot;to resist&quot;.      Further conditions were (a) that.no Portuguese* territory had been occupied by any power, and (b) that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would give facilities for the acquisitionof equipment for the Portuguese forces.      The portuguese government gratefully accepted our offer of A.A.  guns etc, ,but for reasons of neutrality could not agree to accept   .British technical assistance&apos; in installing them, etc,      Theyhave, however, offered to send experts to this country todiscuss technical questions, including demolitions on the mainland.The Chiefs of Staff are not satisfied with the Portuguesereply, since the Portuguese Government would not be bound tomove to the Islands if German action in the Peninsula wererestricted to Spain,,      This would mean that Germany couldrender Gibraltar untenable without any certainty that we should immediately secure the use of the Portuguese Islands in collaboration with the Portuguese.The Foreign Office suggested that the time was not. yetripe for a frontal attack upon the Portuguese.delusion,that a threat to Spain was not necessarily a threat to portugal, but that it might best be removed in the course offurther staff conversations, which we should now propose forthe discussion of the technical questions raised in thePortuguese reply of 10th July.The Chiefs of Staff however consider that the problem should be handled on a high political plane and that thePortuguese should be told that we can only supply the valuableequipment .required for the defence of the Islands in returnfor an undertaking that we should be granted naval and airfacilities in the Islands immediately Spain or Portugal were attacked by the Axis powers.     They agree that Portugueseexperts should meanwhile be encouraged to come to this country.The Foreign Office consider that it would be most unwise to make the direct approach to Dr. Salazar desired by theChiefs of Staff.      It would involve going back upon our previous undertakings and would lay us open to the charge of having concealed our essential requirements during thediscussions which ha ye now been proceeding since last december.      Given (a) the character of Dr. Salazar, with whombusiness can only be discuBsed upon a basis of absolutefrankness, ,(b) his loyalty to the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance,and (c) the satisfactory progress already made with Dr.Salazar, whose performance is in the opinion of all competentobservers, likely to be better than his promises, such an approach/

approach might have the effect of inducing him to reconsiderhis rather reluctant decision to go to the Islands, and soimperil the prospect of obtaining the use of the Islands, atthe appropriate time,in collaboration with the PortuguesesThe Foreign Office agree with the Chiefs&apos; of Staff thatthe problem should now be taken up on the political plane,and it is therefore proposed to consult His Majesty1sAmbassador at Lisbon regarding the best way to handle thismatter with a view to achieving the results desired by theChiefs of Staff, without endangering the progress already made.     A draft telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atLisbon is attached.Meanwhile, the Portuguese Ambassador, on 29th July,pressed for a very early reply to his memorandum of 10thJuly.      He might be informed by way of an interim reply that we much welcome Dr. Salazar&apos;s decision to move to. the islands in certain eventualities, that we are urgentlyexamining1 the question of the supply of the equipment underdiscussion, but that we should also wish to discuss withthe Portuguese Government in greater detail the question ofthe precise eventualities in which the Portuguese Govemmen-trwould leave the mainland.

Draft telegram to Sir K. Campbell. Lisbon.SECBgg.My despatch ITo. 298 /at July 10th:   Portuguese AtlanticIslands^The Portuguese reply is broadly satisfactory insofar as it provides for the departure of the Portuguese Government to the azores.   Unfortunately, however, they only contemplate suchaction &quot;in the event of an attack on the Portuguese mainland&quot;by Germany with or without the collaboration of another country^and they seem to imagine that Spain might be dragged into thewar without Portugal becoming involved.   On this hypothesis,Gibraltar might be made untenable without any certainty of oursecuring alternative bases in  -he Atlantic Islands.   It istherefore most important to secure if possible that the portuguese-guese Government should move to the Islands and   al&amp;ow us to collaborate in their defence not merely in the event of anattack upon the Portuguese mainland but &quot;as soon as Portugal is&quot;threatened&quot; (please see para. 6 of Annex 1 to my despatchHo. 2l\h /of May 3C-K&amp;7).   This involves persuading the portuguese government that the problem of Peninsula security is indivisibleand that, if Germany entered Snain, Portugese independence could not longer maintained on the mainland, since Germany would neverthen permit Portugal to rearm effectively, as is apparentlycontemplated by the Portuguese Government.2.    It has been suggested that the Portuguese refusal to admit British technical assistants to the Islands might be used as a pretext for going back on our offer and that we should nowinform the Portugugse Government that we cannot provide the valuable military equipment under discussion without an under-from taking/them ftoat we should receive naval and air facilities inthe Islands immediately Spain or repeat or Portugal were attacked by the Axis Powers.   I consider however that a direct approach on these lines, besides laying us open to a charge of bad faith,would/

would also he had tactics, since it Blight make Dr. Sala&amp;ardoubtful of oue intentions and induce him to withdraw his promise to move to the ^Islands.   i had hoped that it might he possibleto persuade the Portuguese to accept our view in the course offurther staff conversations, which might have beegproposed forthe discussion of the plans contemplated under para. 5       (c)and (f) in the enclosure to my despatch under reference.   But onre-consideration I doubt whether we could hope to reach   asatisfactory solution except through discussions on the highest level.   I have, therefore, had under consideration the following alternative lines of action:-(1) We should inform the Portuguese Government that we acceptgenerally the proposals in their memorandum of July 10th, thatwe would be glad to welcome Portuguese officers, as proposed under para. 5 (d), and to   discuss with them or other officersappointed for that purpose, the questions set out under para. 3( a) and ( f).   vie should say that arrangements were being made to collect the necessary equipment and to   prepare it for shipment(see para. 5 c).   Meanwhile, however, we should wish to proceedto a further Sank exchange of views on the circumstances whichmight compel Portugal to abandon her neutrality.   We would thenexplain in derail reasons why we consider that it would heimpossible for Portugal to   maintain her neutrality after Spainbecame involved in the war, and the strategic reasonsnecessitating the   use by ourselves, in the interests of the alliance, of the Portuguese Atlantic Islands Immediately Gibraltaris threatened and becomes unusable as a naval   base.   We wouldconclude with the hope that in these circumstances the portuguese government would agree to transfer themselves to the Islands and allow us to collaborate with them in their defence, Once Spainhad abandoned her neutrality,   we could in this connexion make use of the arguments advanced by the Portuguese Ambassador himsel:recorded in para. 5 of  my despatch Wo. lj.21 of the 17th seoemher19*0* that the threat to Portugal would most probably arise inconnexion with &amp;n attack on Gibraltar.

( 2)   Alternatively, if you   consider the above line of approach too dangerous and likely to frighten off Dr. Salazar, we might simply   say if events compel   him to move Ms Government tothe Islands we   assume that we shall then be co-belligerents   andhave full   use of xariBgHi Portuguese territory.   This wouldnot,however, he so satisfactory an assurance, since we should still &quot;beuncertain whether Dr. Salazar would in fact move to   the Islandswhen a German threat to Gibraltar made their use essential to   us.3*   You will   have seen from ray despatch Ho. 239 ofJuly 19th that the Portuguese Ambassador has, on instructions,pressed me   for a very early reply to his memorandum of July 10th.$Should therefore be glad to receive your very early observationsupon the issues raised in this telegram.   Meanwhile I am   informing the   Portuguese Ambassador that we welcome Dr.     Ia2ar&apos;s decisionthatto   move to the Islands in   certain eventualities,/we are urgentlyexamining the question of the supply   of equipment in question,but that we should also wish to discuss with the portuguese government in greater detail the question of the preciseeventualities in which the Srtuguese Government would leave the mainland.

fTWTK DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT.)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.- MOST SECRET -It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document i copy No .1 *W.M. (41)  77th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE confidential Annex.(4th August, 1941, 5.0 p.m.)ERSIA.reviouseferenee :.M.(41)  76thConclus ions,minute 5.)THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that,  ata Meeting of the Defence Committee (Operations) heldon Friday, 1st A^^gust, he had been invited to ^preside,    ,,over a Committee of the Ministers concerned, to consider ohearrangements, both political and military, for implementing the policy of H.M. Government in regardto Persia.     A   Meeting had been held that morning.The object of the military movements   proposed was to ensure acceptance of the demands which we meant to make on Persia without the need for locking up large forces for any considerable period. Owing to the MilitarySituation in the Middle East &quot;there wasno particular difficultyin providing the forces required at the present time.The forces proposed would consist of one Division,with two Armoured Regiments and a. mechanised Cavalry    iBrigade.    These forces would he available on the 12thAugust.    On the same date, six squadrons of aircraft(4 light bomber, 1 fighter and 1 general purposessquadrons) would be in a position to operate.    this force would be   sufficient in casts.of necessarily-d to occupy the oilfields area as far north as Dizful, but wouldnot, of course, suffice to occupy the whole of Persia^.Apart from this force we should havetwo Divisions left in Iraq, which were regarded as adequate.   The situation in Syria gave sorascause for anxiety.   Any difficulties in this area wouldhave to be met by disposition of the troopswithin the Middle East Command, and was part of theresponsibility of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East.The diplomatic demarche which we should make to persia would be on a firm but friendly basis.   Weshould make it clear that we did not want trouble with Persia.   At the same time, we would make it clear thatwe must insist on adequate steps being taken to dealwith the Germans in Persia.    In principle, we would wish to see all the Germans removed from Persia, butwe would recognise that the complete removal of theGerman community at once might be impracticable.We should, however, insist -(a) upon the removal of all Germans who were employed in potentially dangerousoccupa.tions &apos;(b) upon vigorous steps being taken to keep under surveillance and control thoseGerman nationals whose retention mightbe essential for the time being:( c) upon H.M. Minister being furnished witha full list of the proposed German nationalswhom the Persian Government wished to retain.

The Lord President of the Council said that hethought it would also be necessary to offer some financial concessions.   This matter would bediscussed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.It was also thought that we should hold out fairprospects of being able to replace the Germantechnicians whose expulsion we were now asking for.Since these technicians were not specialists inarmament manufacture, it should be.-easier to supplyPersia&apos;s than Turkey s demands for technicians.It was also thought undesirable to say anything to the Persian Government at this stage aboutfacilities for transport through their country toRussia.    To make this request now would be inconsist-ent with the present approach;   but this requestcould properly be made quite soon.It was of the utmost, importance that our approach should be timed to coincide with corresponding diplomatic action bv Russia.and that no further, action such as an advance into Northern.Persia sKould.be taken by Russiaexcept in agreement with us after it had become clearthat purely dinlomatic action could not achieve theresults desired.Consideration had been given.to the question ofwhat steps we could take to minimL.se the risks no british subjects in Persia.     The safety of Britishsubjects in the oilfields could best be ensured fev oLrapid advance by our troops.     No particular action could be taken as regards other British subjects    - -generally*It was thought that the action of our air squadrons should be limited to the dropping of leaflets unless specifically so instructed.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the documentembodying our demands on the Persian Government wouldbe available within 48 hours of being put before theCommittee.   He thought that the question of financialinducements was of the utmost importance, and thatit would probably be necessary to double the royaltypaid by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.   He agreedthat this matter should be discussed with theChancellor of the Exchequer.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that afurther Brigade would be arriving in Iraq later inthe month.    The safety of the Resident at Bushirewould be secured by a sloop lying off the port.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR SmAFF said&apos;that since theMeeting held that morning under the Chairmanship ofthe Lord President of the Council, he had come tothe conclusion that even the dropping of leafletsmight lead to air fighting.   He thought, therefore,that the&apos; action of the Air squadrons should besubject to the following instructions:-   First, the squadrons should not fly over Persia unt-&quot;T our troopsentered the country.    Secondly, their action should belimited in the first instance to air reconnaissance and th6 dropping of leaflets.    Thirdly, if opposed by force, the squadrons might act in support of troops,or against enemy aerodromes, but bombs should not be dropped on other objectives without specific instructions.

The War Cabinet(l) Approved the arrangements outlined bythe Lord President of   the Council:(2) Took note that the question of offeringfinancial inducements to Persia wouldbe the subject of discussion between theForeign Secretary and the. Chancellor ofthe Exchequer:(3) Authorised the Secretary of State for air to issue instructions to the squadronsdetailed for operations in Persiaon the lines set out at &quot;X&quot; above.Great George Street, SvvVolo-3-

This addition to our tank resources in the coming critical months is splendid.   As to the longer terra policy all our experience goes to showthat more heavily armed and armoured vehicles arerequired for modern battle and we should thereforeplan to increase the output of medium tanks at theexpense of light tanks, but not of course at theexpense of your air programme.2.    I am much interested in your suggestion that men for our Tank Corps should be trained in the UnitedStates. &apos; We are examining it here and will let you know our views as soon as possible.3.    We have been considering here our war plans, notonly for the fighting of 1942 but also for 1943.   Afterproviding for the security of essential bases, it isnecessary to plan on the largest scale the forces

needed for victory.   In broad outline, we mustaim first at intensifying the blockade and0 propaganda.   Then we must subject Germany and italy to a ceaseless and ever growing air bombardment.These measures may themselves produce an internalconvulsion or collapse.   But plans ought also to bemade for coming to the aid of the conqueredpopulations by landing armies of liberation whenopportunity is ripe.   For this purpose it will benecessary not only to have great numbers of tanks,but also of vessels capable of carrying them and landing them direct on to beaches.   It ought not tobe difficult for you to make the necessaryadaptation in some of the vast numbers of merchantvessels you are building so as to fit them for Tank-landing fast ships.4,    If you agree with this broad conception of bringing Germany to her knee&amp;, we should not losea moment in: *
