MOST SECRET.W.M.(41) 74th CONCLUSIONS.Confidential Annex.(24th July, 1941    5.30 p.m. ).THE PRIME MINISTER referred to Operation PUMA.The forces for this operation had now been increased to20,000 by the incorporation of the forces for Operation$HRUSTEH.      The whole had been placed under the command of General Alexander.     The Admiral in charge of theoperation was Admiral Hamilton.    Provisional arrangements had now been made for this force to leave this countryabout the 10th August.    It would not reach its destinationuntil nine or ten days later.    The actual decision as towhether the operation should be carried out must, ofcourse, depend upon the situation at the time, and theoperation could be called off any time up to, say, the20th August.    He thought, however,  that we must now takeGeneral Franco&apos;s speech as an indication of hostility tous, and that we should be well advised to make certain of securing the Canary Islands before we were anticipatedby the enemy.There were considerable Spanish forces in the islands, and there would probably be hard fighting.    Butthe Commanders of the forces were satisfied that theoperation held a good prospect of success.The Prime Minister said that the alternative of postponing the operation until September had beenconsidered, but the weather then was much less likelyto be favourable.    He thotight that the course of events in Russia was more likely than anything to have adetermining influence on Spain&apos;s attitude.The force proposed was sufficient to enable us,if we were successful in capturing the Canary Islands,to deal later with other Atlantic islands.

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that there was,of course, a great difference &quot;between occupyingislands which &quot;belonged to Spain and those whichhelonged to Portugal.The War Cahinet took note of theprovisional decision reached inregard to Operation PUMA.Great George Street, S.W.1
