Prime MinistersPersonal Telegram,Serial No. T.742.CYPHER TELEGRAM TO THE PRIME MINISTER of the COMMONWEALTH OP AUSTRALIA.Sent 12 midnight 25th october , 1941.WINCH.  No.   1.    MOST SECRET.1.     Your 682.    Tobruk.    Relief is being carried out inaccordance with your decision v/hich I greatly regret.2.     Your 686.    I am still inclined to think that Japan will not run into war with A.B.C. D. powers unless or untilRussia is decisively broken.     Perhaps even then they willwait for promised invasion of British Isles in Spring.    russian resistance is still strong especially in front of Moscow and winter is now near.3.     Admiralty dispositions had been to build up towards theend of the year ?.ODNEY, NELSON and four R:s based mainly in singapore.    This however was spoiled by recent injury to NELSONwhich will take three or four months to repair.4.      In the interval in order further to deter Japan weare sending forthwith our newest battleship, PRINCE OP WALES,to join REPULSE in Indian Ocean.    This is done in spite ofprotests of Commander-in-Chief florae Fleet and is a serious risk for us to run.    PRINCE OF WALES will be noticed atCape Town quite soon.    In addition the four R. Battleshipsare being moved as they become ready to Eastern waters.    later on REPULSE will be relieved by RENOWN which has greater radius.5.      I agree with you that PRINCE OP WALES will be thebest possible deterrent, and every effort will he made to spareher permanently.    I must however make it clear that movements ofPRINCE OP WAXES must be reviewed when she is at Cape Townbecause of danger of TIRPITZ breaking out and other operationalpossibilities before DUKE OP YORK is ready in December.CHURCHILL.

(THIS DOCUMENT XS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAN-NIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toanouro the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.COPY NO.W,M.(41)  1Q6TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 8.Confidential Annex,(27th October,  1941 - 5,0 p.m.)U.S* SeR,Aid to RussiacIPreviousReference?ff.M.(4l) 94thConclusions,Minute 3),THE PRIME MINISTER drew the War Cabinet&apos;attention to telegram No., T:i: dated 26th October,from Sir Stafford Cripps   at Kuibyshev.      In this telegram Sir Stafford said that relations between this country and Russia, as reflected at his post,were getting worse, and that if we could not opena second front the only way in which we couldimprove matters was to send troops to Russia^ andhe urged the despatch of a force not less thana corps, with an adequate proportion of R.A.F. ,to either the northern or southern extremitiesof the Russian battle front.      The Prime ministers aid that on the previous day, after consulting the Foreign Secretary, he had sent a telegram toSir Stafford Cripps pointing out the reasons why we could not send troops to Russia.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that in an interview that afternoon   M, Maisky^ had taken much the same line as our Ambassador.      He had saidthat the Soviet Government were much worried bythe turn which events had taken.      He had alsodrawn attention to various speeches which had doneharm, and had instanced speeches made byLord Halifax and Lord Croft.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY said that the records of the conversations which Mr, Harriman and he had had with M. Stalin showed that the latter had notstrongly pressed either for the despatch of troops to Russia, nor for the creation of a Western Front.On both these matters he had Loan prepared to abide by the decision of the BritishGovernment.      Stalin&apos;soutstanding purpose had been to get supplies of tanks, aircraft and raw material.

In this connection the Minister of Supplysaid that he had received private information from america that the United States Government was prepared to make an immense additional contributionto the material which they had already undertaken to send to Russia.      The combined contribution ofthe United States and the British Government toRussia would thus be very large indeed,,      Hesuggested that this fact should be emphasised inspeeches by Ministers.(previous:M.&apos;(&apos;4i) 73rdConclusions,Minute 3,)At a later stage in the discussion THE PRIMEMINISTER referred to the proposal that Britishtroops should be sent to the Caucasus, or to thesouthern Russian front in the Ukraine,,      It was clear that it would take a very long time, probablytwo or three months, to get a British corps into action on this front.      It would be extremelydifficult to build xn a supply &apos; ine.      There wasthe farther point that it would certainly bedifficult   to get the Australian Government to agreeto their troops fighting ear, this front, and it wouldbe very difficult to make a force available withoutdrawing on the Australians.,      There was the furtherconsideration that if we sent British troops tothe Caucasus, we should require the full use of thePersian railways, and it would be impossible tosend in supplies to Russia by this route. This proposal was one which we should not entertain.Reference was made to tho Wc British fightersauadrons which had been sent to Murmansk.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he wished thata larger force had been sent.      In any case, hegreatly regretted the arrangement entered into, thatthe machines with which these squadrons had been -equipped should be handed over to the Russians andthat our personnel should return to this country.It would be a great encouragement to the Russiansif the arrangements made in this matter could nowbe modified and the two British fighter squadrons,complete with personnel and equipment, could besent south from Murmansk or Archangel,to take part in &quot; the air fighting   en.   tho   mnixmRussian   front,It Uoul.-&apos;ucourse.be necessary to ask the Russians to g.lve anundertaking that proper arrangements would be madefor these squadrons to receive their supplies.This course would also involve some reduction inthe increase in the   air forces to -bo sent to theMdidle East0

is;THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said thatthis suggestion would involve difficulties, sincethe line of communications of these squadrons,which would run north and south, would cut acrossthe east and west line of communications of theRussians.     Nevertheless he would investigate it.The War Cabinet(1) Invited the Secretary of State for War toreport to the Prime Minister on theconditions at Archangel in the last war,when supplies were sent to Russiathrough that port.(2) Invited the Minister of Supply to circulate to the War Cahinet extracts from the records of Mr. Harriman&apos;s andhis conversations in Moscow withM. Stalin which bore on the questionof sending military aid to Russia.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for air to examine and report to the War Cahineton the suggestion that arrangements shouldhe made for the two fighter squadronswhich had been at Murmansk to go southand take part in the air fighting onthe main Russian front&apos;,,Great George Street, S.W,1*,27th October, 1941*
