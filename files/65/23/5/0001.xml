OOP? Nti.f . &quot;    W.M. (41) 76th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(31st July, 1941 - 12.15 p.m.)At the Prime Minister&apos;s request, general auchinleck gave to the War Cabinet a summary of themilitary situation in the Middle East.Abyssinia and Somaliland.The Situation had been practically cleared up and this part of the Middle East Command hadvirtually ceased to be an operational area and had become an internal security question.Syria.Sj^ria was being consolidated as rapidly aspossible.      Difficulties with the Free french hadbeen resolved by the Minister of State.     The french had accepted the situation that General Wilson&apos;s wordshould be supreme in any difficulties that might arise between military and civil authorities.     preparations were being made to meet any advance by the Germans fromthe north.      Troops sent into Syria from Iraq, werebeing returned to that country.Cyprus.By the 12th August we should have, a completedivision, plus ancillary units, in the island.      In ashort time Cyprus should be capable of resisting any large scale attack likely to be brought against it.Libya.The position here was one of stalemate.We had not enough araoured forces to ^attack. -   While theenemy was better orf in this respect, xr aid not appearthat he intended to make any early attack.     His supply situation was precarious, thanks to the attacks on hisbases and communications by the Navy and Air Force.The enemy was nervous and feared that we were stagingan attack at the end of the present month.Tobruk.Tobruk was still holding out, the garrisonbeing aetive and in good heart.      It had establishedsuperiority over the enemy so far as patrol activities were concerned.     Tobruk had supplies and rations for two months and further supplies were being put inregularly.     He (General Auchinleck) did not think, therewas much chance of Tobruk being taken by assault..,Neither was he nervous of air attaok at the moment.The position might be different if the enemy couldbuild up large air forces in Oyrenaica.THE middle east.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 73rdConclusions,Minute 2.)

ISDefences West of the Delta.Work on these defences was proceeding.- The reorganisation and reconstitution offormations in his Command, rendered necessary by therecent fighting, was proceeding steadily.AIR MARSHAL TEDDER said that his main objective in- the Middle East at the present time wasto throttle the enemy communications to North Africa.In addition the successful attacks on shipping atTripoli and in passage, good attacks had been made onthe ports of Naples, Taranto and Palermo;    the recentattack on the last named having been particularlysuccessful.     For this purpose it was necessary tomake the best possible use of Malta as an air base.The number of aircraft which could be accommodatedon the island was, however, limited, and a strongfighter force had to be maintained there.The attacks on enemy aircraft on the ground in Sicily and Sardinia fitted into the picture ofour general strategy, by reducing the effort of enemy aircraft (torpedo aircraft and dive-bombers)against our convoys into Malta.Throughout his Command he was building upthe Air Force again, and the losses suffered duringthe Greek operations had nearly been made good.     Hehad, however, a big commitment in covering convoysgoing into Tobruk.     In order to do this it wasnecessary to maintain a standing fighter patrol -always an undesirable expedient - which, however, upto now had been fairly successful.As to the future, he was arranging so thataircraft could be switched from one theatre to anotheras the need arose, in the shortest possible time.There was now one fighter squadron atCyprus and arrangements were being made so that two more squadrons could be sent there.      It was alsoarranged that a striking force would be able to operate from Cyprus.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the DefenceCommittee would have to study two important problems in the near future -(1)      the reinforcement of the Middle East with heavy bombers,   and(2)     a service to carry Air Force personnel from one part of the Middle East theatreto another if the need arose.In order to carry out (8) it was necessarythat as many troop-carrying aircraft as possible should be made available.     He asked the Secretary ofState for Air to make a report to the War Cabinet onthe number of transport aircraft which could be madeavailable in the Middle East within, say, the next two or three months.

The Prime Minister also referred to theextent of the  fcross now in the Middle East;    and tothe scale of reinforcements of tanks.     He gavedirections that General Auchinleck should see a copyof the recent exchange of telegrams&apos;between himself and President Roosevelt on this subject.Reference was also made to the proposal tomake a new port at Safaga. This should be pressedthrough by the Civil Authorities.The War Cabinet thanked General Auchinleckand Air Marshal Tedder for their statements.Great George Street, S.W.1.

(41)  76th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(31st July, 1941, 12.15 p.m.)IRAN. THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he was anxiousto be sure that the forces at our disposals in Iraq(Previous would be sufficient to enable us to bring pressure to reference:       bear on the Iranian Government to eject the GermanW.M.(4l)  75th community without leaving us too weak in Iraq.Conclusions,Minute 4.) The War Cabinet were informed that it was ourpresent intention to present our demands by about the   &apos;12th August T  At that date we should have two divisions in Iraq,  including the forces returning to that country from Syria.    It was proposed that one Division and oneBrigade should be sent into Iran.    Taking into accountreinforcements arriving about the 20th August, weshould have approximately a Division left in Iraq.A bomber squadron in Northern Iraq, would be ready to operate against targets in Iran, and three moresquadrons  could be moved up if necessary.GENERAL SIR CLAUDE AUCHINLECK said that afurther Division would be arriving in Iraq, from india at the end of August.   While &quot;the plan proposed would leave us rather thin on the ground in Iraq, hethought that the risk was worth taking.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Great George Street, S.W.I.?

Cipher (M.0.12. ) 29/7.Following for Cs.-in-0. from Chiefs of Staff No.152.We have discussed your 9982/G with Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, and it has been decided that we should go ahead at once with all preparations to take military action on lines suggested in our 80081 of 25th July, and generally agreed by you.2.     It is proposed to aim at 12th August as the date foran ultimatum to the Iranian Government demanding expulsion ofthe Germans, if dipolmatic pressure should have failed to achieve this by then.    Necessary movement of forces should therefore be completed by that date, if possible.   We thinkit important, however, that no movement into Iran should bemade until all, or nearly all, the necessary forces are ready.Please report whether you can work to the date proposed,3. Reference your para. 1, We think that a mechanisedcayalry brigade or equivalent force should be added if it canbe made available either in Iraq, or from Middle East.4.     Reference para 2.   We do not agree that we should occupy Bushire for the following reasons.    (a) The occupationof Bushire cannot be represented to the Shah as co-operation in the defence of interests common to him and ourselves.    (b)we do not want to tie up forces in an area remote from the oilfields and serving no military purpose.    On the other hand we feel that to evacuate the Resident would be inconsistent withline proposed to be taken with the Shah.5.     Reference your para. 3.    Fife agree that no attempt should be made to evacuate our nationals before military action is taken.6.      Soviet Government have suggested that we should notonly demand expulsion of the Germans but also road and rail. facilities in Iran.    It has been decided that it would be wiser to do one thing at a time, and that our original demandshould relate only to the expdsion of German nationals fromIran.       Soviet Government are being informed accordingly.7,     Soviet Government have informed us that they are willing to take part in joint military plans and have agreedthat concentration of their forces and ours should precedepresentation of our joint demands.    They have also suggestedthat co-ordination of action of British and Russian forcesearmarked for Iran should be arranged in Moscow.    This would clearly be undesirable, and it is being&quot; suggested to them thatstaff conversations are unnecessary, since the British and russian forces will be operating from different directionsand not conjointly.    They are being told that we will keep them informed of the military action we propose, and hope thatthey will do likewise, and that once operations have startedthe Military Commanders on the spot will.of course keep eachother mutually informed of progress and intentions.\ i IM     &apos; -i- ill III ^IS^SSi-i^S^lS I
