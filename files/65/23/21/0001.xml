AND SBCSRSTMINISTER TO MR. FABDEB.I.    I am very glad to receive your. No. 638 and X tMnkX ought to let you know for your most secret information about Tobruk that Lyttelton and X only with difficultyprevented General Auchinleck from resigning Iiis cosaaandon the grounds that the Australian Government had no confidence in his military Judgment. Bad your decisionbeen based on political grounds he would not have felt the want of confidence implied.2.    TtiB September relief has been effected successfully.The cost is measured by an indefinite delay in the inter-mingling of the 8th British Division with the two indian divisions in Iraq and Persia, thus making three mixed^nglo-Xndian units.   X still hope that you millyour decision that the last Australian Brigades must bepulled out of Tofiruk without reference to the great

licensing operation by st&amp;ch we trust all will be relieved^ The exelmnge of tfedbs brigades with MoUiers&apos;during the October moonless period will certainly handi-cap the Air Force in their preilsdnaasy-.  tgbt forair superiority before the battle by forcing them to divert their strength to providing  loiter cover forthe shipping involved.  Every d**ys delay in deliveringthe attack will sake our task ssore formidable.  Every-tiling points to the first days of November, and the psfcdduring which the regaining Australian Brigades would be involved is very short,    Australian tramps have bornethe burden of Tobruk and we should all deeply regret that they should be cut out of the honour.3*    Believe m9 everyone here realises your politicalembarrassments with a majority of only one.  ffeverthelepAustralia might think this is a time to do and dare. .we have been greatly pained here by the suggestion, notsjade by you, but implied, that we have thrown andundueburden on the Australian troops.    The debt to them is

Immense bat i&amp;e Mesial farms have suffered morecasualties actually and relatively.   Moreover, ttoBritish Sutoarlne Service has lost nearly a thirdkilled outright, ami X could give you other instances.Therefore we feel we are entitled to count uponAustralia to make every sacrifice necessary for thecomradeship of the Suspire.   But please understandthat at whatever cost your orders about your own troops will be obeyecioC Intel.)    Vs.. .3 0 0* 9*9*41.
