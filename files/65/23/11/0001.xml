IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document. , c ^COPY NO.   /gW.M.(41) 85TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 7.Confidential Annex.(21st August, 1941, 11.30 a.m.)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Paymaster-General (W.P.(41) 197).The Memorandum proposed that, in order toavoid any last-minute hesitation, our Ambassador at moscow should be authorised, at his discretion, togive certain assurances, if, in the absence of suchassurances, the orders to destroy the Caucasian oil industry were likely to be dangerously delayed.     TheMemorandum recommended that the United StatesGovernment should be approached on the matter as soonas possible, but that, if need be, the proposed declaration of assurances should be made unilaterally,accompanied by a verbal statement that we were in communication with the United States Government witha view to acquiring thoir co-operation.The following points were made in discussion:(l)    THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER pointed outthat the commitment involved was estimated,if the war lasted two years after.,demolition, to amount to about  100 millions.Beforetentering into any such commitmentwe should certainly communicate with theUnited States Government and ascertaintheir views.      It was impossible to foreseewhat our position would be after the war,but it was not reasonable to suggest thatwe should be able to carry out such anundertaking without American help.(2)    THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thoughtit was difficult for us, at a time when we were offering so little assistance tothe Russians in the operational field, topress them to undertake this work ofdemolition.     Russian agriculture was greatly dependent upon petrol.     These.   .    oil fields produced 27 million tons ayear, and their destruction would condemnlarge sections of the Russian people tostarvation.

(5)    Continuing, the Prime Minister said thatthe amount of help which we could give to&apos;the Russians by way of oil imports was sovery small that he could not see that wehad any effective inducement which wecould offer them to destroy their oilfields,if they were not prepared to reach adecision themselves to do it.       It wasimpossible for us to say what M. Stalinwould do in regard to this issue.     Hethought that we must he ready to bombthe oilfields ourselves if the Russiansdid not destroy them.(4)    THE MINISTER OP WAR TRANSPORT pointed outthat, during the war, oil imports intoRussia would necessarily have to come fromthe United States.     Their participationwas essential in any measures to compensatein part for the destruction of theseoilfields.(5)    In this connection the War Cabinet wereinformea that the Russians had alreadyasked the United States authorities tosupply them with some very high grade oils(iso-octane and iso-heptane).     Shipmentshad been despatched to Vladivostok.      Itwould be important to ensure that the helpsent to Russia from the United States didnot impair the supply of iso-octane fromthat country required for our expanding aiz*effort.(6)   On the other hand, it was pointed out thatM. Stalin had already stated that it was his intention to order the destruction of the caucasian oil industry rather than to allowit to fall intact into the hands of theGermans, and had accepted the principle otco-operation in the work of demolition.There was no intention that Sir stafford cripps should make any offer unless he found that it was necessary to avoiddestruction being delayed too late.   Further,the work of demolition would take a very long time, and would require to be planned in advance.The War Cabinet decided as follows(a) The first step should be to make aaapproach to the United StatesGovernment, explaining to them thedifficulties of the situation,telling them the kind of proposals wehad had in mind, and asking them fortheir advice and for any suggestionsthey might have to offer, *-2-

(b) At the same &quot;time, a tels-gram.should besent to Sir Stafford Oripps, informir-ghim that, if a favourable opportunityarose, he could enquire whether theRussian demolition plans were ready and whether we could offer any assistance.      The issue was, however,a very delicate one, and we must atall costs avoid applying pressure,at any rate at this stage, to theRussian Government, since this mighthave the opposite effect to what was desired;(c) The   Foreign Secretary was invitedto arrange  for    draft telegrams to Washington and Moscow to beprepared on the atoove lines, and circulated to the Ministers concerned,for their comments before despatch.Great George Street, S.W.I.,
