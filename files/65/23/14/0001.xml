(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)* TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is request^ that special care may betaken toPensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.COPY NO./ OW.M.(hl) 90th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.(5th September. 19hl     12.30 P*m.).H.S.S.R.(previous reference:I.M.(4l) 88thConclusions,Minute 2. )Message fromStalin tothe Prime Minister.THE PRIME MINISTER informed the War Cabinetthat the previous evening the Soviet Ambassador had asked for an interview at which he had communicateda personal message from M. Stalin.      The PrimeMinister then read to the War Cabinet the message,a copy of which is annexed.In conversation M. Maisky had emphasised&apos;&apos; the salient points of the message and had drawn attentionto the great size of the German forces engaged on theEastern Front and the serious nature of the lossesthe Russians had incurred both in men and in resources,He had said that the present might be the finalturning point of the war and that if Russia were defeated, our own chance of winning might have gonefor ever.     He had earnestly pressed for action onour part to draw away some of the German forces.Although there was nothing in the actual v/ords which m. Maisky used to justify it, he (the Prime Minister)had the feeling that the possibility of a separate peace could not be altogether excluded.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSconfirmed this and said that M. Maisky had pointed to the necessity for the scope of the Moscowconversations being broadened to include a discussionof joint strategy and had suggested that greaterpressure should be brought to bear on Finland towithdraw from the battle.     With regard to this latter point, we could of course declare war onFinland and we could ask the Americans to take some further coercive measures; but on examination it didnot appear that it would be to our advantage to doso in view of certain shipping arrangements withthe Finns which were now in force and which wouldbe terminated.      The United States had alreadyfrozen the Finnish assets.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had informedM. Maisky that he would carefully consider M. Stalin&apos;message and would reply to it within 2h. hours.     Hehad explained the various reasons which made itimpossible for us to operate on the Continent in sucha way as to draw off forces from the Russian front.We would not hesitate to sacrifice 50,000 men if we thought that by so doing we would relieve the pressure on the Russians,,     All the Military Advisers to theGovernment were agreed that there was nothing effectivewhich could be done this year.     He had also explainedthat it was physically impossible for a second frontto be built up in the Balkans unless Turkey came intothe war.     He told him that from the start of the invasion of Russia, he had continually pressed theChiefs of Staff to examine every possible measure v/hichmight be taken to assist the Russians.     The Chiefs ofStaff had done their best but the results had all beennegative.     He had invited him to see the Chiefs ofStaff with the Foreign Secretary the following morningso that he could hear at first hand the arguments onwhich their opinions were based.     This meeting hadtaken place.THE FIRST SEA LORD gave the War Cabinet an account of the discussion v/hich the Foreign secretary and the Chiefs of Staff had had with M. Maisky.     Theformation of a front in France had first beenconsidered and MP Maisky had made great play with thefact that we controlled the sea and could landanywhere we liked.     He suggested that we should landa force of 15-20 Divisions so as to draw off 30 or 40from russia    The Russian Admiral thought this would be apossible operation if diversions were simultaneously made inother directions to confuse the enemy.     The Chiefs ofStaff had explained that in narrow waters sea powerand air power must be considered together and that even if we managed to land fairly considerable forces,the Germans could concentrate their Divisions, of whichthey still had 20 or 30 in France, much quicker by rail than we could do by sea.     The Germans had quite a powerful air force in France, including between200 and 300 bombers and 500 fighters and would he ableto act from a seciu^e position against our landings.The Chiefs of Staff had tried not to harp too much on the difficulties of the operation as they realised that considerable sacrifices would be justified ifany good object could be achieved.     They had emphasised, however, that nothing that we could docould possibly caxise the Germans to draw off appreciableland forces from the Eastern Front this, autumn.M. Maisky had suggested that the best way in which wecould ensure against invasion would be to engage theGermans in France.     The Chiefs of Staff had pointedout the fallacy of this argument.     The best opportunitythe Germans had had of successfully invading thiscountry was when.a feeble front was established on theRiver Sommej    if the Germans had allowed that front    -. .to remain, our strength would have been drawn awayinto France and we should have fallen an easy prey.The Germans could easily recreate that situation. Ifwe placed considerable forces in France in the nearfuture.     We could pin no hope on a rising in france as the people were quite without arms or organisation.

The disc&quot;;ssion had then turned on thepossibility of a Balkan front and the Chie:&quot;.s of Staff had explained how impossible it would be to land any appreciable forces in Greece in existing circumstancesaTHE PRIME MINISTER said that there was no---&quot;&quot;&apos;escape from the conclusion reached by the Chiefs ofStaff as to the impossibility of any action in NorthernPrance or in the Balkans of a nature to draw forcesaway from the Russian front and the War Cabinetexpressed their agreement with this view0The Prime Minister then drew attention to atelegrajn which had been received from Sir stafford cripps (No. /o^ofrom Moscow) in which our Ambassadorearnestly begged that we should give consideration tothe Russian situation, which seemed most serious, and make super-human efforts to draw German forces away.The Prime Minister said that while he fully sympathisedwith the attitude of mind displayed in this telegram,the views expressed took no account of the hard facts of the situation and. he proposed to send a suitablereply.      The Prime Minister then read to the War cabinet a draft which he had prepared in reply to M. Stalin&apos;message.     He felt that M. Stalin was worthy of beingtold the truth and was capable of facing the facts ofa situation.     He did not think, therefore, that weshould make promises which we could not possiblyfulfil.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICEagreed, and said that it would be worth including inthe message a statement to that effect.      It would be wrong to mislead the Russians by promising to do things which were beyond our power.THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY said that he thought theterms of the telegram were too harsh and depressing.The Russians were asking for 500 tanks and 1+00 aircraft month and he favoured an immediate promise that fromthe time when navigation would reopen, we would providethe Russians with half of this demand from our own resources.     We would then press the Americans to supply the other half from their own resources withoutdiminishing our appropriations.      This was a promisewhich he felt that we should fulfil;    it would mean avery great effort on our part, particularly intransportation, but to keep the Russian Army in thefield would be an objective worthy of every ounce ofour energy.     If there was any truth in the situation disclosed by Sir Stafford Cripps, we ought to send our delegation to Moscow at once to try and sustain the morale of the Russians.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that heshared Lord Beaver-brook&apos;s desire to aid the Russianshut-any such promise would have to be subject to thedevelopment of the war. We could hard-ly spare that number of aircraft if the whole weight of the german attack was shifted back to the west.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that M. Maisky had made it clear in his conversation that anything supplied by us would beregarded as under a lease-lend arrangements    &quot;l^-the.....German weight was transferred to the west, then theRussians would do what they could to assist us.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY inquired whether animmediate attack in Cyrenaica could not be made,A big success in that theatre would have great moral effect even though it might not directly assist theRussians.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was just asanxious as anyone else for an early success in libya and had spent several days discussing mattersfrom every angle with General Auchinleck;    the latter had promised to strike at the earliest possible moment and it would be unwise to over-ride his judgment.     General Smuts had been consulted and had expressed the same view,     If we fought too soon,we would not have any remarkable success and our power to renew the fight would be put back- by manymonthso     If we v/aited till the right moment, we might achieve groat results.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICEthought that if it were possible to make the..jpromisessuggested by the Minister of Supply, it would be agreat incentive to increase production in ourworkshops.    Workers would respond to a call togi*,xre help to Russia without lessening thefalfij.*ne;r.v:- of our own needs,,     But if a promisewere to bo made, M, Maisky should be firmly told that he must stop his own propaganda campaign inthis country; and if this did not produce the desiredresult, it might be worth while warning M. Stalin.THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OF home security agreed, and said that there was a potentialfield of trouble in the activities of various bodieshere trying to stir up a campaign against theGovernment on the issue of help to Russia.     IfM* Maisky overdid his support of such a campaign,there was a grave danger that it would stimulate a reaction which would defeat his ends,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was verymuch alive to this danger, and agreed that M. Maiskyshould be warned.     In the meanwhile he wouldprepare a re-draft of his reply^and would lookfurther into the possibility of making a definitepromise to fulfil half the Russian demands from our resources - a course which he was inclined to favour.-Great George Street, S.W.I.

PERSONAL MESSAGE,of M. STALIN,  the CHAIRMAN OP THE COUNCIL OP PEOPLE&apos;SCOMMISSARIES.to M. WINSTON CHURCHILL, The PRIME MINISTER OPGREAT BRITAIN.Many thanks for your promise in addition to the200 fighters released by you formerly to sell to theSoviet Union another 200 fighters,     I have no doubt thatour pilots will be able to man them and to use them againstthe enemy.I have to say however that these aircraft,  which apparently could be put into action not immediately and notat one time, but in separate groups and at differentmoments, will be not in a position to bring about anysubstantial change at the Eastern front.      They will benot in a position to bring about any substantial changenot only because the war on such a tremendous scalerequires a constant flow of a great number of airplanes.Still more important is the fact that for the last threeweeks the position of the Soviet troops deterioratedin such important regions as the Ukraine and Leningrad.The relative stabilisation at the front, whichwas achieved some three weeks ago, was lately upset by thetransfer to the Eastern front of the 30-34 fresh german divisions and a tremendous number of tanks and aircraft.In addition the 20 Finnish and 26 Rumanian divisions have become more active.     The Germans consider a danger in theWest as a bluff and do not hesitate freely to transfer all their forces from the West to the East.     The Germansbelieve that they can beat all their adversaries one by one;first the Russians and then the British.

As a result we have lost the greater part of theUkraine and the enemy is now at the gates of Leningrad.All these circumstances have brought some veryunpleasant consequences.     We have lost the iron ore ofKrivoi Rog and a number of metallurgical plants in theUkraine.      Further we have evacuated one aluminium workon- the Dnieper and another from Tikhvin, one motor workand two aircraft factories from the Ukraine, two motorworks and two aircraft factories from Leningrad - all ofthem could be put into operation again at their newplaces 7 or 8 months hence at the earliest.      Thisweakened our power of deft-nce and placed the soviet union in a position of mortal peril.At this point permissible to raise the question,where is the way out of this highly critical situation?I believe there is only one possibility to remedy the position - it is to establish all ready thisyear a second front somewhere in the Balkans or in France,which would be able to divert from the Eastern front some30-40 German divisions, as well as secure at the same timefor the Soviet Union 30,000 tons of aluminium at thebeginning of October and a minimum monthly delivery ofsome 400 airplanes and 500 tanks (small and medium size).Without these two forms of assistance the soviet union may be either defeated or weakened to such an extent that for a long period it may be not in a position to helpits allies by active operations in the struggle againstHitlerism.I am afraid that my message today will causeyour Excellency the gravest concern.     I cannot help it.

Kremlin,5rd September, 1941.Experience has taught me to face realities howeverunpleasant they may be and not to be frightened of to tell the truth however unwelcome it may be.The Iranian affair in fact turned out not at allbadly.      The common operations of the British and soviet troops secured the issue in advance.     So will it bealways in the future wherever our forces will act together.But Iran is only an episode.      The outcome of the war willbe decided of course not in Iran.The Soviet Union as also Great Britian doesnot desire a war with Japan.      The Soviet Union honoursits treaty obligations? including its treaty of neutralitywith Japan.       If however Japan would break this treaty and attack the Soviet Union she would find a strongresistance on the part of the Soviet troops.In conclusion let me express my gratitude for your admiration for the deeds of the Soviet forces, whichare fighting a sanguinary war against the bandit hordesof Hitlerism for our common cause of liberty and freedom.STALIN.

OUTWARD TELEGRAM[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should bekept under Lock and Key.][This telegram is of particular secrecy and .aw0retained by the authorised recipient and not paj[CYPHER] war CABINET DISTRIBUTION.To*- - SOVIET UNION,FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO MOSONo, 1156.ayth August, 1941. D,    1.40 a.m.,   29th August, 1941,hhhIMMEDIATE.&apos;&apos;.Prime Minister to Mr. Stalin,1.     I have been searching for any way to give you helpin your splendid resistance pending the long termarrangements which we are discussing with the United Statesand whicR^ill form the subject of the Moscow Conference.Maisky has represented that fighter aircraft are much needed in view of heavy losses.    We are expediting the 200Tomahawks about, which I telegraphed in my last.     Our two squadrons should reach Murmansk about September 6, comprising40 Hurricanes.     You will I am sure realise that fighter aircraft are the foundation of our home defence, besideswhich we are trying to obtain Air superiority in Libya, andalso to provide for Turkey so as. to bring her&apos;on our side.Nevertheless I could send 200 more Hurricanes, making 440fighters in all, if your pilots could use them effectively.These would be 8 and 12-gun. Hurricanes which we have foundvery deadly in action^     We&apos; could send 100 now and twobatches of 50 soon afterwards, together with mechanics,instructors, spare parts and equipment to Archangel.    Mean-while arrangements could be made to begin accustoming yourpilots and mechanics to the new type if you will send themto air squadrons at Murmansk.     If you feel this would be useful, orders -will be given here accordingly, and a full .technical memorandum is being telegraphed through our military Air Mission.2,     The news that the Persians have decided to ceaseresistance is most welcome^     Even more than safeguarding the oilfields, our object in entering Persia has been to getanother through route to you which cannot be cut.   For thispurpose we must develop the railway from the Persian Gulfto the Caspian and make sure it runs smoothly w,ith re-inforced railway material from India..    The Foreign secretary has given to Maisky for you the kind of terms we should like to make with Persian Government so as to have a friendly people and not be compelled to waste a number of divisions merely guarding the railway line.    Food is being sent from India, and if the Persians submit, we shall resumepayment of the oil royalties now due to the Shah.    We areinstructing our advance guards to push on and join handswith your forces at a point to be fixed by the military commanders,,,.
Commanders somewhere &quot;between Ramadan and Kasvin.    Itwould oe a good thing to let the world know that Britishand Russian forces had actually joined hands.    In ourview it would he better at this moment for neither af usto enter Tehran in force as all we want is the throughroute.    We are makings large-scale &quot;base at Basra, and we hope to make this a well-equipped warm water reception portfor American supplies&apos;, which can thus surely reach the caspian and the Volga region,5.    I must again express the admiration of the Britishnation for the wonderful fight the Russian armies and russian people are making against the Nazi criminals.General Macfarlane,was immensely impressed by all he   sawat. the front,   A very hard time lies before us, butHitler will not have a pleasant winter under our ever-increasing Air bombardment,    I was gratified by the veryfirm warning Your Excellency gave to Japan about suppliesvia Vladivostok,,    President Roosevelt seemed disposed when met; him to. take a strong line against further japanese aggression whether in the South or in the North-west pacific, and I made haste to declare that we would rangeourselves upon his side should war come.     I am most anxiousto do more, for Chiang Kai-^hek than we have hitherto feltstrong enoi?eh to do.    We do not want war with Japan, and Iam sure the  way to stop it is to confront those people who are divided and far from sure of themselves with theprospect of the.heaviest combination.
