Such an invitation, however, was unlikely to be receivedunless and until a German act of aggression tookplace against the Iberian Peninsula.   He (the PrimeMinister) had told President Roosevelt that we mighthave to carry out Operation PTLGRTM in Septemberwithout waiting for an act of provocation.    Other-wise we shoul^ run the risk of being deprived of gibraltar without obtaining an alternative naval base.   We should not, however, set the operation in motion without giving most careful considerationto all the factors involved at the last moment:I,e., in ahout three weeks&apos;  time.   The president had said that steps would be taken to have in readiness, by about the middle of September,American forces of occupation.   We should, ofcourse, keep the Americans informed of our intentions;    but they would not misunderstand theposition if we decided that the Operation shouldnot take place [See Telegram TUDOR No. 18).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he thought that, the President ha.d read a gooddeal into Dr. Salazar&apos;?? letter tohim,which had onlyreferred to the provision of war material (SeeTelegram AVENUE No. 23) .THE PRIME MINISTER schosen to read Dr. SalazHe (the Prime Minister)president*s interest inconsider a slight changerre should nor; inform Dr,other preoccupations, vresupply the Portuguese rriof the Atlantic Islandsthat they should therefofor such assistance.aid that the President hadar&apos;s letter in this way*.thought that in view of thethe.Azores, we ought toin our policy, namely, thatSalazar that, owing to ourwere not in a position toth armaments for the defence in the immediate future, andre apply to the United states the War Cabinet invited the foreign secretary to consider the Prime MinisterJs;suggestion.

The President had proposed to Japan some time ago the neutralisationof Indo-China and Siam under a joint guarantee of.the United States, Japan, Britain, China and others,hut there had been a number of conditions which wereunacceptable to the Japanese.      The presidentsidea was to negotiate about these unacceptableconditions and thus procure a moratorium of 30 days,during which we might improve our position in singapore and the Japanese would have to stand stillsAt the end of the Note which the President proposedto hand to the Japanese Ambassador was a passage tothe effect that any further encroachment by japan in the South-west Pacific would produce a situationin which the United States Government would be com-pelled to take counter measures even though this might lead to war between the United States and Japan,ffae President also proposed to add that the UnitedStates Government would be similar!v interested in  theNorth-west Pacific and Manchukuo which might make it possible for the Russians to associate themselves with this move.Later in the meeting the Prime Ministerread out to the War Cabinet a. telegram^which had just arrived from President Roosevelt to the effectthat the President had seen the Japanese Ambassador,who had approached him on the subject of the resumption of the informal conversations which hadbeen taking place regarding the neutralisation ofIndo-China and Siam.     The President said that thestatement he had made to the Ambassador was no lessvigorous and substantially similar to that already agreed with the Prime Minister, The japanese ambassador had asked whether negotiations could berestarted.     To this the President had replied thatif Japan was prepared to readjust its position the conversations might be resumed, but not before a clear statement had been made by the Japanese oftheir aspirations and plans.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that, before weoould decide on the next step it would be necessaryto ascertain exactly what the President had saidto the Japanese Ambassador.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Great George Street, S.W.1.

COPY NO,,W.M.(4l)  84TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1*Confidential Annex &quot;o&quot;.(19th August, 1941 - 11.30 a.m.)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that our Memorandum had &quot;been presented to thePersian Government on the 16th August.     A reply had been asked for in three days&apos; time, and should reach us on the following day (the 20th).       it looked as though the answer would be negative.The Defence Committee had decided that if there were indications that our pressure was having some effect,we might give the Persians 24 or 48 hours in which to reconsider   their answer.     But we should at all costs avoid an ultimatum with a time limit.     If itwas clear that the Persian answer was unsatisfactory,,we should take immediate military action, withoutdelivering an ultimatum.THE PRIME MINISTER said that&apos; he now felt some uneasiness about the position whereby we hadlimited our demands on the Persian Government to theexpulsion of the German community now in theircountry.     Should we not be in a false position if those demands were accepted, and later we had to followthem up with further demands for transport facilitiesthrough Persia?     Another argument against further delay was the attitude of the Turkish Government,which might at any moment result in our having to face a very awkward situation.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY agreed as to the needfor prompt action, and said that he thought thesituation was tending towards a Persian refusal ofour demands.      In any case, our troops were ready to march, and we were working towards military action being started on the 22nd August.Consideration then turned to the exchangeof Missions between the Russians and ourselves.The Foreign Secretary said that he had hada telegram from the Minister ojf State, in Cairo,reporting that the members of our Mission were not,as he had thought, in Iraq, ready to leave for theCaucasus, but in India.     The Minister of Statesuggested that the Mission should not be confined to military matters,    but should include experts on other matters (e.g. subversive activities).       HePERSIA.(PreviousReferenceW.M. (41) 8Sft&amp;-conclusions,Minute 4.)

(the Foreign Secretary) was strongly opposed tothis course, which would give rise to suspicion.The War Cabinet:-(l) Agreed that the British Mission tothe Caucasus should be a military mission and should not compriseexperts on other matters.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary,after consultation with the Chiefsof Staff, to arrange for instructionsto be sent to Moscow, to the effectthat we should be glad if the russian military Mission now in the Caucasuswould proceed forthwith to join our forces in Iraq.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary toinclude in this message a request for information as to the place towhich our Mission should proceed.(4) Agreed that the exchange of Missionsshould take place as soon as possible,without waiting for our forces toenter Persia, notwithstanding thatit involved the violation of Persianair.Great George Street, S.W. 1.-2-
