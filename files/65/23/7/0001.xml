Was it the case that the UnitedStates Government were not prepared to join with usin warning Japan that any aggression against Thailandwould result in war?THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that this appeared to be the meaning of recent telegrams from washington, in particular telegram No.3740,reporting a conversation between Lord Halifax andMr, Cordell Hull,The Foreign Secretary referred to thediscussion which had taken place at a meeting of theDefence Committee (Operations) on 8th August, atwhich it had been agreed to send a telegram to thePrime Minister setting out the suggestion of an&apos; oblique&apos; Anglo-American warning to the Japanese, andthe arguments for and against issuing a warning onour own account if the United States would not join in with us*      THE LORD PRIVY SEAL handed to Mr. Eraser-a copy of the telegram as despatched to the PrimeMinister (Abbey No*23).MR. FRASER said that he appreciated that,in the event of Japanese aggression against Thailandtaking the form of an advance into the northern part of the .country, it was our intention to occupy the Kra Isthmus *      It seemed to him, however, thatthe Kra Isthmus itself was the most likely place for the Japanese to land troops*THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that so far therewere no signs of Japanese preparations for landingthere,THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that untilthe end of September we should not have sufficienttroops available to occupy the -T.ra Isthmus.Accordingly, an interim plan had been prepared :&quot;ora limited advance into the Isthmus to occupy Singora,as soon as the Japanese committed any act of aggression in Northern ThailandoTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that it wasimpossible to say whether war with Japan would or would not result, either from a Japanese act of aggression in Northern Thailand or from a Britishadvance into the Kra Isthmus.

COPY No .W.M. (41)   79th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex B.(llth August, 1941, 5.0 p.m.).  THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that, now that ithad been arranged that our Ambassador and the soviet ambassador at Angora should make their declarationsto the Turkish Government that day, it was proposedthat the British and. Soviet Ambassadors at Tehranshould present their firm hut friendly   demands tothe Persian Government on the 14th August.    This datewas two days earlier than had been contemplated, a fewdays ago.    On the one hand, there was a good, deal tobe said for leaving time for the assurances which theRussians and ourselves had given to Turkey to take effect.    On the other hand, it would, be a pity toallow too long a period, to elapse after we had. givenour assurance,  since the Turks might ask questions asto our intentions vis-a-vis Persiav and we did not wish to have to discuss the matter with them before we made our demand-j    at Tehran.The question of timing was one of delicatebalance.   On the whole, however, the Foreign secretary thought that Turkey&apos;s reaction would, not be toounfavourable, more especially since our demands;would not take the form of an ultimatum and therewould be nothing to indicate that if they werenot accepted, we should follow them up with more drastrcaction.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL raised thequestion whether., if the Persians did. not agree toour demands, we should, in fact have any option but toproceed to back them by force.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that, so far as thePersian Government was  concerned, our demarchewould, not be framed, in a way which would make it anirrevocable act*    On the other hand, the russians would certainly expect us to back our demands withforce if they were not accepted.In discussion^ the War Cabinet .were informed, thatthere were signs that, as the result of our troop concentrations near the frontier, the Persians were now paying more heed, to our warnings.    Thus, informa-tion had. been received that Persian Police were taking steps to see that Germans left the Abadan area.

The War Cabinet:-(l) Agreed that our demarche to the PersianGovernment in regard to the expulsion ofmembers of the German community now inthat country should be presented on the14th August&apos;(2) Took note that arrangements had been madefor a British Liaison Staff to be flownto the Russian forces in the Caucasusas soon as British and Russian troopsmoved into Persia, in order to ensureclose liaison between the British and russian Commanders:(3)  Invited the V.C.I.G.S. to take steps toensure that the Russians made similarpreparations for the despatch of a LiaisonStaff to    ; attached to our forces which would enter South Persia.Great George Street, S.W-1.-2-
