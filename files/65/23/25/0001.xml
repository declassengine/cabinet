THE PAR EAST a THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR-FOREIGN affairs said that he had seen the Dutch W^M. Minister(Previous and the Chinese Ambassador.   The former had takenReference! the view (which was broadly that of the ForeignW.M.(41) 103rd Office) that the new Japanese Cabinet was unlikelyConclusions, to take any dramatic steps for, say, three weeks.B/finute 5.) After that we might expect trouble.The Chinese Ambassador thought that the Japanesemove, when it came, would be likely to be againstSiberia, and that Japan would hope that she couldattack Russia without the United Kingdom or theUnited States declaring war against her.The Foreign Secretary,  continuing, said that hehad sent a messo.ge to Washington on the 18thOctober on the lines settled by the War Cabinet, attheir last Meeting, indicating that we had been content to leave the handling of-the Japanese, problem to theUnited States and that we were prepared to supportany action, however serious,   which the UnxtedStates might decide to take (Telegram 5653&apos;to washington).The Fbreign Secretary added that Mr Cordell Hullwas apparently considering the possibility of encouraging the peaceful forces in Japan by some   .small arid isolated barter exchange (Telegram 4750/from Washington to the Foreign Office).The Foreign Secretary said that, he thought thatit would be a mistake to embark on any such policyin order to influence Japan in our favour.    Sucha transaction might, however, be justified if theobject was to obtain some material which we ba.dlywanted for our war effort.The War Cabinet took note, withapproA^al, of these statements.Great George Street, S.W.1(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.- MOS^ SECRET - It is requesteu ti:ai S,,e ia! care may betaken to G0FY No. ( ^-&apos; ensure the secrecy of this document.W.M.

OUTWARD TELEGRAM 3Sr*     , ^[This Document is the Property of HiB Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should bekept under Lock and Key.][This telegram is of particular secrecy and should beretained &quot;by the authorised recipient and not passed on.][Cypher] - DEPARTMENTAL (SECRET)^&quot;FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO WAShInG]&quot;&quot;Noa5655. 1   D, 5o0 a.m. 18th October,lVih October, 1941.&quot;.        ; C 3 t ] [ ] . ;Your telegram No.4706 [of the&apos;15th October: UnitedStates-Japanese relations].Since your conversation with Mr. Hull JapaneseGovernment nave fallen, apparently on the issue of theWashington conversations and the conduct of affairs hasbeen put into extremist hands.   It is therefore necessary,in conjunction with the United States Government to takestock of the situation having regard to (a) the stimuluswhich the German advance on Moscow is giving to those in japan in favour of early action and (b; the effective pressure of our economic embargo on Japan.20   It is ^possible that the direction which theJapanese will take is southward, e.g. into Thailand (Siam)and we have had an urgent appeal from the Thai PrimeMinister for co-operation (see Bangkok telegram No.724)Japan knows, however, that this choice is likely to bringher into collision with the A.B.C.D. front.   This risk is less in the north, where Japan has already a strongconcentration of military forces.   Japan may also hopethat the departure of the Government from Moscow and the consequent weakening of its authority may lead to somedisintegration of the Soviet forces in Siberia.   We have toreckon therefore with the possibility of an attack uponRussia in the fairly near future.30   Even though there is little effective action that we could take in this eventuality (and you shouldmake it clear that we have taken no decision on the point)it is desirable that we should enter into consultation withthe United States Government at once.   So long as ourRussian Allies are resisting Germany in the west it isimportant that we should nox weaken or discourage theirresistance by a failure to support them to the best of our ability in the Far East.,   We have also to consider theposition of our Dutch Allies and the effect on the spiritof the Netherlands East Indies if we were to fail theRussians.4r   Still more important is the question whether weoan afford to allow Japan to attack us &quot;one by one&quot; andhaving disposed of Russia to be able to turn on us,strengthened and freed from the Russian danger, at themoment which suited her best and which would no doubtcoincide with the moment at which Germany in the westshould be free to do the same.
51   Indo-China has already gone: Japan has established her &quot;bases there and if she is allowed to free herselfy by an attack on Russia from thepresent threat to her rear the danger to ourselveswill be very serious indeed.6e   We have been well content to leave handling ofthe Japanese problem to the United States and tofollow the United States in their policy of maximumeconomic pressure0   Prime Minister made it clear,moreover, in his broadcast of 24th August, that should their attempt to reach a peaceful solution failwe should range ourselves by their side.   Thisremains the position^   While,. as stated above,positive action by ourselves alone is unlikely tobe very effective we are prepared to support any  .action, however serious, v/hich the United states may decide to take,,7c   Naturally   we shorn d still prefer ifpossible to keep Japan out of the world conflictand to detach her from the Axis by some meansshort of war.   If there is anything which UnitedStates Government think we can do to deter japan from .war we should be glad to give it immediatecons consideration.8*   Please communicate the foregoing to Kir. Hulland ask whether he can inform us of the action whichthe United States Government contemplate in theevent of a Japanese attack on Russia.[individual]
[This telegram is of particular secrecy and should beretained by the authorised recipient and not passed on]o[Cypher]DEFARTL3SNTAL (SECRET)Viscount Halifax.No. 1750.17th October, 19U.PROM WASHINGTON TO FOREIGN OFFICE.D. 3.A-1 a. a. I8fR. 11.35 a. in. lactober, 19^1.October, 19U.IMMEDIATE. &apos;I told llr.yHull:this afternoon of conversation that Ihad had yesterday with Japanese Ambassador.&apos;    y- -Mr.- Hull :said that their information .f roa Tokyo was thatthe atmosphere&quot;was calmer than might have&quot;been-expected andthat new.Japanese Government wished to continue theirconversations with the United States.   He said&quot;that it was extremely difficult to think of any practical way by whichforces favourable to settlement in Japan might be strengthened without at the same time giving cause forunfounded anxiety to Chine.se, and running risk of undoingeffect of firm attitude adopted by United States andGreat Britain together.   Mr. Hull thought it vras vital thatthis danger should be avoided.2.   Thinking aloud, he went on to say that the only way in which he thought that any such encouragement might conceivably be given to the peaceable forces in Japan was bymeans of some jrajfte small..and Isolated barter exchange such asPfor example, a limited amount of American cotton against alimited amount of Japanese silk.     He asked me what Ianticipated would be your judgement on this kind of suggestion,it being understood that the condition for anything of thekind would be that Japanese took no action in the meantime to disturb the status quo.. 3.   I told him I would certainly ask you.   I felt sure thatyou would attach the -greatest importance to maintenance offirm front, but at the same time you would be as anxious as hewas to keep things on as even a keel as possible for as longas possible.   Your principal anxiety I anticipated would belest any action that was taken might have the effect ofpulling a stone out of the dam.   If however any limited action that could he taken was clearly limited in scope, and treatedas an isolated transaction it might be that the advantage to be gained by the encouragement of peaceful elements in Japan wouldoutweigh objections.
2h.   Mr. Hull said he would be glad to hear your mind, butwished me to impress upon you the hope that this telegram mightbe given most restricted circulation and that you shouldnot misunderstand his attitude at the present timeB &quot;which waspurely that of desire to. examine in complete confidence with you whether it was or was. not possible to find any way of limited action   that would assist in keeping things quiet.   -As.I was leaving he emphasised to me jonce more thattheir reports from Tokyo showed a situation that was lessdisturbed or affected by recent changes than he Yrouldhave expected.
