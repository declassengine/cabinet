(41) 96th CONCLUSIONS, MINTJTE 1.Confidential Annex.(24-th September, 1941, 6.0 p.m.)THE middle east.Report bythe Minis teaof State.THE MINISTER OF STATE said that the first thingwhich had struck him on reaching Cairo was how muchopinion there was out of touch with opinion in thiscountry.   One of the points he wished to improve wasthe flow of information between Cairo and. London.As Mini.Office, witclerical stWar Councilin*-0hief an increase Baghdad,the Governothey were athe minutesto add to tGovernmentbody cons isin-Chief, wCommittee.ster of State he had. only a small Privateh a staff of five Civil Servants andaff.   He was Chairman of the Middle Eas, which consisted of the three Commands &quot;S-d our Ambassador to Egypt;    our Ambassadorthe High Commissioner of Palestine, andrs of Cyprus and Aden also attended whenailable.   All these officials received of the War Council.   He was now proposinghf: Council a representative of theof India.   There was also a technicalting       himself and the three Commanders-hich corresponded broadly to the defence the MilitarySituation.The military situation was still affected bypast history.   General Headquarters had grown froma small operational staff into a large and highlycentralised organisation.   In the past, year theArmy had fought campaigns in eight different countries.   As a. result, most formations wereheterogeneous, and the Commander had few complete-units under his hand-   This fact, almost as muchas the shortage of armoured vehicles, was the reason why the Commander-in-Chief had not been in a positionto undertake the offensive.The Minister said that, he sawin our strategical situation in thIt should be possible to strike a&quot;Yestern Desert and still leave ourtransfer troops to the Near East bhad time to develop an offensive tIt was unfortunate that it had notstrike earlier in the Western Dosethe enemy mace no attempt to reduebe possible to stage a bigger offeWestern Desert than was at presentFurther:hc increase in armouredmight enable us to strike not only-front door, but also on his flanksnothing depressinge Middle East,heavy blow in thesolves time toofore the enemyher;- in the spring.been possible tortj but, providede Tobruk, it mightnsive in the contemplated.fighting vehiclesat the enemy&apos;s

Communications,General Brett8scriticisms.Use of PlyingPortress os *Our coramuni cat ions in the Middle East were a source of anxiety.   They were far too constricted,and no attempt had been made to open up the Red Segut.   Par too much was concentrated in the area between Suez and Alexandria, which was liable to heavy bombing attack.   Three main projects were now under way in order to improve the situation:-(l) A Railway from Safaga to Kena, inthe Kile Valley.   This would be finishedby the 1st March.^2)  The opening of the Akaba-Maan route.This would be part road and part railway,and would take 800 to 900 tons a day.(3) Steps to increase the productivity of port Sudan.   The port itself couldhandle 3,000 to 5,000 tons a day.   Therailways from Port Sudan to Wadi Haifacould take 2,250 tons    a day.   Prom WadiHaifa to Shellal the river could only take 600 tons a day.It was now proposed   to build up the capacity ofthe river traffic by the provision of tugs andbarges.   Further wharfage capacity had been discovered at Assuan.Refer:nee was made to telegram 2968 from Cairo,reporting criticisms by General Brett, of the AmericanAix- Service, of our administration in general, and,in particular, of the organisation at Port Suez.THE MINISTER said that the port was not as welladministered as it should be.   Nevertheless,considerable improvements had been made.   The turn-round had been reduced from 22 to 14 or 15 days.General Brett&apos;s criticism ha- been made in ignorance of the fact that, a special motor transport portexisted at At t ica cap ah1e of unlo adin g 12 0 v ehi elesa day.    It seemed that a number of the Americanofficers came to the Middle East with their mindsmade up as to the conclusions they would reach.THE PRIME MINISTER said that these criticisms,even if ill-founded, represented a dangerous factor.He invited the Minister of State to communicate to    . j.him. particulars which he could,make use of in a       &quot;7*rprivate telegram to Washington.    It was also import- (ant that. General Brett should be taken to see thegood work which had been done on port improvements *etc.Reference was made to the suggestion in paragraph6 of the same telegram that we should send .Plying Fortresses out to Egypt.THE CHIEF OP TEP. AIR STAFF said that when thismatter had been raised before, considerable troubleshad been experienced with these aircraft.   He would now consider the suggestion again.-2-

Telegraph andTelephoneCommuni eat ionsCo-operationbetweenAir craft and Tanks .Morale.Continuing, THIS MINISTER OP STATE said thatthe telegraph and telephone communications wereanother source of anxiety.     Even if it were possible to got adequate co-operation from the egyptians, tho communications were far below the capacity required by the Services, and were veryvulnerable.     It would be necessary to ask for a service communications system to be shipped out.The first stage would be to improve the communications between Alexandria and the Canal.     Other importantsections should be dealt with by instalments.Great strides had been made in co-operation be-two en aircraft and tanks.   Air attack   could now be calleddo-&quot;n on a target by the ground forces in 4* minutes.It was hoped to reduce this to about 25 minutes .The improvement had been very noticeable.The Minister drew attention to the number ofrather second-rate officers now in the Middle East.Two years in an enervating climate had furtherdulled their faculties,    and unless new blood was introduced the position would deteriorate.    It was important to secure the exchange of officers in theMiddle East with those in this  country, withoutany suggestion that the officers being sent homewere being Stellenbosched.     There were many tiredfaces among the junior staff officers, and also inthe Western Desert.The position would be greatly improved iftoken leave could be introduced:    say some 20 or 30men a month, starting with those who had been overthr:-e years in the Middle East.The MailServie e.The military commanders .Malta.The mail service, again, was very bad, and itwas important to take steps to improve it.   Theairgraph service had made a considerable improvement.but called for a larger censorship staff than therewas available.The Minister of State said that he had thehighest opinion of General Auehi.nleck, who possessed,a very flexible mind and. considerable politicalsense.    There was no military proposition which hewas not willing to examine.   General Cunningham,who commanded our force in the Western Desert wasthe right man for the job.   He was young, fit,enterprising and prepared to take risks .   general wilson, in Syria,, was very thorough and could be relied upon to prepare a. sound defensive position,although not perhaps so suitable for an offensivemovement.The Minister said, that he had formed tho highestopinion of the military organisation at Malta.General Dobbic had the whole matter well in hand,and had inculcated an aggressive spirit.   He wasbacked up by three Commanders of high quality.The Air Force was in a high state of efficiency,and the aircraft were well dispersed and protected.

political The Minister said that the political situationSituation in Egypt was not very satisfactory.    The Egyptiann Egypt. Prime Minister was not an apt politician.    Forexample, in cotton we had made a concession whichhad cost us  15 millions.    The Prime Minister had so handled matters that the bargain made was now a source of agitation against us.   Nevertheless,  therewas no alternative at the present time but. tocontinue to support the Egyptian Prime Minister.Although the position was somewhat uncomfortable,it was not on.; which need be taken too tragically.There had been some controversy about declaringCairo an open city.    The centre of Cairo, however,ha&quot;&quot;1 not been bombed, and the Minister did not thinkthat we should bomb Rome in retaliation.Syria. When he had been in Jerusalem in the previous week 9the opinion had been that the position in Syria was improving greatly.    That had been before GeneralCatroux1   declaration.   Although this was not too welldrafted, on   the whole it was a satisfactorydo cument -After our occupation of Syria,certain Vichy french officials had returned to their former posts and. had continued in iherbaci habits. Considerable progress had now been made in getting rid of unsatisfactoryofficials, and. 150 had already left. - The free french authorities hn* undertaken to remove any official against whom specific information was laid.The French were very short of trained officials, andit would probably be necessary for us to meet thesituation by drafting British officers  into themilitary zone (this included the greater part ofthe count ry) on grounds of s ecurity .The French Special Service Officcrs*wore also a cause of difficulty, but General Catroux had undertaken to abolish them.The Syrians themselves wanted local autonomy,but they were unwilling to sign a treaty as they feared that this might prejudice their claims to independence.    The Minister thought it was premature to sign a treaty at the present time.    The difficulty was, however,  that it was  easy for the Syrians tomake it appear that it was ourselves and the Frenchwho were holding back.Pood Shortage The Minister referred to the apparent shortage in Syria. of wheat in Syria.   His own vie&quot;&quot; was that a greatdeal of wheat ha&apos;3 been hoarded. He described the steps which ho proposed to take to break the spotmarket and bring out the hoarded, &quot;&quot;heat.Palestine. The Minister said that, he had come to theconclusion that, unless some action was taken inPalestine before the end. of the war we were riskinga considerable explosion.    The pressure in thecountry was now risingoTHE PRIME MINISTER referred to the suggestionthat, had been made that Ibn Saud should become king of an Arab Federation;    and that provision should bemade for an autonomous Jewish State, with reasonable36 These officers had combined the functions of intelligence Officers and Administrators, End werenotoriously corrupt and unpopularo

room for expansion.     This suggestion had been well received by Dr. Weizmann, and he (the Prime Minister)would be glad if the Foreign Secretary, the Secretary ofState for India and the Secretary of State for the colonies would consult with the Minister of State and see whetherthis suggestion could be carried further.Iraq.. THE MINISTER OF STATE said that the position in Iraqwas fairly satisfactory.      Steps were being taken toco-ordinate the reports from the Intelligence Officers inIraq and in Syria, which had hitherto presented a ratheralarmist view of the situation.     Our Ambassador at baghdad was happy about the position.Turkey. The Minister of State said that he thought thatvictory for us in the Western Desert would do more than anything else to hearten Turkey.     He thought that weshould be prepared to use the forces now allocated for thedefence of Syria, and some of those allocated for thedefence of Iraq, as a pool available for use in Turkey.As regards the Air, he thought we should do better to sendfully equipped British squadrons to fight in Turkey, ifTurkey made adequate aerodromes available to us, ratherthan to give aircraft to Turkey.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was more important to secure that the Turks would resist enemy pressure togive passage to German troops through their country, andwould allow us to make preparations on Turkish aerodromes in advance of hostilities, on the lines of what germany had done in Bulgaria, than to press them to enter the war on our side.     The Prime Minister mentioned that general wavell was going to Tiflis where he would have discussions with the Russians.     We were sending out reinforcements tothe Middle East which would enable us to act in north persia and, if necessary, in the CaucasusiTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the Turks had made up their mind that they would not be attacked beforewinter.     They were therefore thinking of what would happen in the spring.     He thought it was important towork out with the Minister of State and the Chiefs ofStaff the best offer of assistance which we could make tothe Turks, and to communicate this offer to them as soonas possible./&quot;The War Cabinet expressed their thanks to the Minister of State and took note of the statements set out above.Great George Street, S.W.I.ft See C.O.S.(4l) 32nd Meeting (0) Minute 5.

PROM EGYPT.FROM CAIRO TO FOREIGN OFFICE.Sir M. Lampson. D.      2.08 p.m.      23rd September, 1941.No. 2968. R.      6.00 p.m.      23rd September, 1941.23rd September, 1941.IMPORTANT.I have seen General Brett of the American Air Serviceseveral times since he has been here.     He is so frankly criticalthat I feel I should let you know, and you may wish to pass on to minister of State.2.     General Brett&apos;s first criticism is that there should beunification of command.      I cannot myself see that with the improve-ments introduced by the Minister of State e.g. joint operations(grp. undee.) etc., there is much in this point, but I remember that Mr. Harriman was most insistent on the same point when he was herIn any ease it is hardly within my domain.3.     General Brett is bitterly critical of the confusion and lack of efficient organisation at Suez.     Too many separateauthorities, no proper co-ordination etc., unloaded cargo left for months to clutter up the docks at great risk of air destruction.I have passed this on to Mr. Rucker.4.     Perpetual change of plans at Port Sudan.     First of all(grp. undec.) devoted to air assembly:    next taken over by thearmy: and now finally handed to the Navy.     This at the cost ofquick assembly of American air material arriving from America.5.     Failure to hit the enemy in Libya whilst he is held inRussia - General Brett is particularly critical on this, probablybecause he does not fully know the facts, though he has been up at the western front.6.     Lastly, why do we not bring out supply of &quot;Liberators&quot;or &quot;Flying Fortresses&quot; to Egypt, whilst the weather at home is toouncertain for their employment, and use them here to pulverise theenemy bases in Libya before he switches his full air attack on egypt after Russia?     This is clearly a highly technical matter,though to his lay mind it seems sensible.     I am passing it on to air Marshal Tedder.7.     The whole attitude of General Brett is so (grp. undec.)lycritical, and he so openly says what his report to Washington is going to be, that I am endeavouring to catch him on his return fromBasra and have him meet the Service Commanders so as to get hisimpressions off his chest and enable them to consider if there is anything in what he says.
