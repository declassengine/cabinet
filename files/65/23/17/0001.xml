MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(1.6th September, 1941 - 5.30 p. m. )THE PRIME MINISTER informed the War   -Cabinet that the Commonwealth Government had insisted on the withdrawal of the AustralianDivision from Tobrulc,    He read out his Most secret and Personal telegrams to the Prime Minister ofAustralia Nos.  620/and 63q &quot;   and a Most Secret and personal telegram.from the Prime Minister ofAustralia No.,  59&apos;In discussion the view was expressed thatthe decision was a lamentable one;   but that the sooner the operation of withdrawing the Australiansfrom Tobruk was carried out the better.    If possiblethey should all be moved out during the present month.The Chiefs of Staff had already telegraphed to the commanders - in-Chief to make plans for the withdrawalof the Australian troops from Tobruk.THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the War cabinet of the request which he had made to president roosevelt to give us the use of Naval transports tocarry additional British troops to the Middle East.At the time that he had made this request he had contemplated that we should send out two additional british Divisions to the Middle East,    The militaryauthorities now proposed to send out a large numberof reinforcements, drafts;, and R. A.F. groundpersonnel.    The Prime Minister said that he did not feel able to tell President Roosevelt that we had abandoned the idea of sending two additionalDivisions to the Middle East but still wanted theuse of the ships,The Prime Minister added that it now appeared that President Roosevelt would allow theships to make a second trip.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFthought that it might be possible for a completeDivision to be carried on each trip,THE PRIME MINISTER said that a solution might be found on these lines, and asked that thematter should be further investigated by theChiefs of Staff.Great George Street, s, w. 1,7  Colin.   aJbMUif..

CYPHER TELEGRAM TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA

Sent 6.0 p.m. 11th September, 1941

MOST IMMEDIATE

No. 620. Most Secret and Personal.

Following for Prime Minister from Prime Minister most strictly secret. Begins.

1. In my immediately following telegram I send you in its entirety General Auchinleck&apos;s private telegram to me about relieving Australian troops in Tobruk. I do so in complete confidence in your discretion. General Auchinleck&apos;s telegram is the result of prolonged consultation with the Naval and Air Commanders in the Middle East.

2. You will see from his telegram that if you insist upon the relief of the Australians in Tobruk it is physically impossible for it to be completed in time for you to make the statement you desire to the Commonwealth Parliament by the middle of this month.  In fact only half could be removed during the moonless period of September, and the other half would have to be removed during the latter half of October, which is the very time when all preparations for the offensive will be intense, and when the preparatory work of the Air Force will demand their complete concentration on the enemy&apos;s rear areas, dumps and airfields. In no case could you make any statement to the Commonwealth Parliament because any suggestion in public that the reliefs were to take place might lead to heavy air attacks on Tobruk harbour and along the coast at the time when your troops would be withdrawing. If however you insist that the Australian troops must be withdrawn, orders will be issued

Bde. group and one Indian Cavalry Regt. in Tobruk by Poles showed that naval risks involved were appreciable as nearly all ships were attacked by aircraft.     A.continuation of relief would throwan added burden on fleet destroyers at expense of other naval operations.     The burden already thrown on these destroyersby needs of maintenance is considerable.      If relief is carriedout it will be at expense of maintenance while it lasts butthis is a risk I am prepared to accept.   . .   -2. During recent relief a minimum of 5 fighter squadronswere permanently employed in escorting ships at expense of offensive air operations on which air superiority rests andeven these were inadequate.     The normal allotment to coverordinary maintenance averages 3 squadrons.3. The relief of remainder of garrison would have to becarried out during moonless periods 17th (repeat 17th) to 27th(repeat 27th) September and 16th (repeat 16th) to 26th (repeat26th) October because risks entailed in shipping personnelduring moon periods are unwarranted.4. Availability of troops for relief of Australians.Apart from undesirability of putting other Dominion troops intoTobruk the one (repeat one) South Africa Division is motorisedand is required for mobile offensive operations, 2 (repeat 2)-South Africa Div. is still untrained and New Zealand Div. isabout to move into Western Desert to train for its allottedfuture/
future task.   4 (repeat 4) Indian Div. which^is.well.trained in Western warfare is already in forward area in western desert.     5 (repeat 5) Indian Div. is in Iraq, and not (repeatnot) available.     50 (repeat 50) Div. could not (repeat not)be made available in time even if it could be spared from itsimportant task which is only half completed.     There remains6 (repeat 6) Div. (? about to) be diluted with Indian troops which process would have to be postponed indefinitely ifDivision were sent to Tobruk.     This is presumably not(repeat not) an insuperable difficulty so that this divisioncould be made available though this would weaken Syria andretard for time being work on defensive positions just started.*   .

During this period we hope to-concentratemaximum air effort in gaining air superiority in Western Desertand to complete all arrangements for a sortie from Tobruk.)(?Both of) (?these) intentions (?would be) prejudiced by continuation of relief operations.6.      The health and morale of Tobrukgarrison is very good but power of endurance of the troops isnoticeably reduced and this is likely to be further reduced as time goes on and I detect signs of tiredness in those inresponsible positions.    An alternative solution to relief would beto strengthen the powers of resistance of garrison.7*      It is however still just possible to relieve personnel of one more Australian Bde. by a brigade of 6(repeat 6) Div.  during latter half of September.      This would leave a garrison of two Australian Bdes. one British Bde., and Polish Bde.and a mixed assortment of supporting arms.    I am not (repeat not)in favour of this course as I consider that break up of 9 (repeat9) Australian Div. with its very strong esprit de corps and highmorale would definitely reduce tactical efficiency.of garrison.8.      An alternative to relieving oneAustralian Bde.  during latter half of September is to send an infantry tank battalion to Tobruk.      This would have advantage ofmorally and materially increasing the defensive powers of garrison in addition to increasing its offensive powers in future operations.With this/
With this reinforcement I feel confident about Tobruk&apos;s powerto resist -attack.   ;9.      It is (?conceivable) that[certain eventualitiessuch as failure to gain air)superiority ,or interruption of oursea communications in Red Sea by enemy action might entail&apos; aretardation of intended date for resuming offensive &quot;in-ftfe sternDesert.

Begins *la    Your telegramsSsbs 620 and 631 have &quot;been most carefully considered and discussed with our advisors.   Vitalconsiderations centred around two points5   (1) concentration of Australian Imperial Force in one Corps under its ownCommander who has a direct responsibility to the CosmionwealthGovernment;   (2) necessity for relieving the garrison in viewof decline in their powers to resists,2*    Yon will recollect that one (l) was laid dovsi in telegram Hps 91 of March 9th ? 1940*     It is a fundamentalmeasure of effective eo-operation with Dominion Forces inthe Empire Armies *     It is a principle involved duringthe last war not without some opposition.    It is vital tothe Australian people to have concentrated control and direction of its expeditionary forces.    V/e do not considerit unreasonable to expect that hy this date^ effect wouldhave hean given to this principle *    We had occasion torefer to the disposition of our troops and the importance weattached to their concentration in telegrams Nos: 76 ofHovetnher 8th and 257 of April 18th*    It was also emphasisedpersonally to the Ccnmander-in-Ohief in the Middle East andthe Chief of the Imperial General gtaff &quot;foy the former PrimeMinister,5*    In regard to one (2) my telegram Ho; 584 outlinesseries of requests dating from July 20th for relieving theBinth division and the following comments are made on general Auekinleck?s telegraau(1)   Waval risks *    These are noted &quot;bat in the ahsenceof effective naval opposition in the Mediterranean or anycontemplated naval operations this does not appear to he a sufficiently weighty reason^(2)   Air protection^    General Officer CommandingAustralian Imperial Force advised early August that he had agreed to postpone relief one month to enable necessary air strength to be provided and this would also give longerhours of darkness    In view of increase in air strength and improved situation in Syria? Iraq, and Iran this reason wouldnot appear adequate*(s)

(3)   Moonless periods.,   Reasons noted.(4)   Availability of troops for relief *    As It was anticipated  originally that we would carry out offensive operations in the Western Desert at the same time that we meta German offensive in Syria for which considerable forces would hare had to &quot;be allotted it is not seen liow the defenceof Syria can &quot;be prejudiced in view of forces availableofrankly the reasons against relief by other Dominion troops are unconvincing^,(5)   under irability of relief daring latter half ofOctober^     It would appear possible to complete relief -and instal new garrison by assumed date of proposedoffensive even if anticipated date is realized which it is-understood is not generally the ease in large scalepreparations *    Reference to a sortie from Tobruk fillsas with grave concern In view of advice we have had &quot;thatthe Hlnth Division will be quite unfitted for such an operation? which will Involve continuous and severe fightings(6)   Decline in the physical powers of the troops.It is observed that the Commander-in-Chief states that althoughhealth and morale is very good, power of endurance isnoticeably reduced.     If the garrison cannot be relieved.?it will be required to stand up to a total period of eightto nine monthss continuous front-line service under conditionsof great hardships, and trying climate .    At the end of this time they are to carry out an offensive operation..    Theproposal to reinforce the garrison with one battalion of heavy tanks appears to acknowledge decreasing power togarrison and to discount the difficulties of air and naval protection previously urged against movement of personneloaly*(7)   Relief will prejudice the forthcoming offensive.We do not concur in the view that further operations arelikely to be compromised in view of the time factor^.4*     In view of the responsibilities reposed In theGeneral Officer Commanding Australian Imperial Force and theadvice tendered by him and the General Officer Sommanding the9th Division which is supported by the government advisersherej, X am bound to request that withdrawal of the 9th division and re-concentration of the Australian Imperial Force be proceeded withe    As pointed out in my telegram Hot 584.any reverse suffered by the garrison of Tobruk in the lightof the reports and requests that have been made over an extensive period would have far-reaching effects *    We do notconsider military considerations put forward by the commander-in-chief outweigh case for the relief of the garrison.59 As intimated in my telegram No: 584 it was not intended to make any statement until withdrawal had beencompleted and re-concentration carried out.PADDEHo    Snds*
