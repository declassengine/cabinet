Theholes in the ship also pointed to its having been torpedoed..   After the first explosion the -Captain had.taken certain steps in regard to closing hatchways,and so forth, which, while reasonable precautions  fromthe point of view of an internal explosion, had.probably made it more difficult for the crew to escapeafter the later explosions took place.No definite report had been received as to how thesubmarine had got into Scapa..   But the nets did. not extend beyond the 5-fathom line.   Further, there was an entrance near Kirkwall which had been closed in thelast war but had not yet been closed in this war.

W.M.(59)  57th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 10.Confidential Annex.*      *     *GERMANY. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat it was clear that considerable internal conflictwas proceeding at the present time in Germany.Discontent was being expressed both by a group ofGenerals and also by the public.   Anti-Ribbentropfeeling was rife, it being thought that his policy has failed, in regard, to Turkey.   Reports had beenreceived that a considerable number of Army officers had been shot, and. that a larger number had been arrested.   The reports received justified the viewthat some measure of revolt had taken place in theArmy.   There appeals.red also to be disaffection, in theNavy, a large number of Officers having tendered theirresignations to mark their disapproval of the recentGerman policy in the Baltic, the result of which hadrendered impossible any further progress of the traditional German policy of controlling the Balticlittoral.    It was probable that Herr Hitler&apos;s object in summoning a. conference of party leaders was toattempt to  collect information as to the general stateof feeling in the country.    The Secretary, of Stateadded that he might later receive further information in regard to what had transpired.    In the meanwhilehe thought it would be unwise to make any reference tothis subject in the Press.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statement.
