MINUTE 6.Confidential Annex.*     *     *STAFF CONTACTS        The War Cabinet were informed that a communicationWITH BELGIUM.from King Leopold had been received through the BelgianAmbassador to the effect that M. Stein only representedhim in economic matters, and not in any way in political or military affairs.    It seemed, therefore, that this possible channel of communication with the BelgianStaffs was not open.Sir Roger Keyes had, however, been invited to staywith the Dowager Queen, and it was suggested that before doing so it would be advisable for him to see theForeign Secretary, the Secretary of State for Warand the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in orderthat he might be informed as to what we desired to achieve in the way of Staff contacts, and with allother relevant information.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had received aletter from the Belgian Ambassador repeating theinformation that M. Stein was an economic adviseronly to King Leopold, but the letter had concluded with the phrase, which might be significant, that ifhe (the Prime Minister) wished any further information,the Ambassador was available to give it to him.   Hehad accordingly asked the Ambassador to eomeWnd see him.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statements.m     m     9Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,13th October, 193? 9.
