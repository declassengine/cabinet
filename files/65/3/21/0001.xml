4 nt?lot)MEETING BETWEEN THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that he andTHE CHIEF OF THEIMPERIAL GENERAL    the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, accompaniedSTAFF, THE CHIEFOF THE AIR STAFF,   by General Ismay, had met General Gamelin, GeneralAND general gamelin. Georges, General Jamet and General Vuillernin, at general Gamelin&apos;s Headquarters. He proceeded to give an account of the main points in the discussion whichhad ensued.General Gamelin estimated that there were now60 German divisions on the Western Front.   There wasno sign yet of any mechanised forces, but he expectedthat these would in any ea.se be kept 100 kilometres ormore behind the front line until the atta.ck actuallystarted.    General Gamelin was quite sure that anattack was limpending.   As to the form this would take,an attack through Switzerland seemed improbable,except possibly as a turning movement to create a diversion.   Even more improbable was an attack onthe southern part of the Maginot Line, over the Rhine.He thought it more, likely that the Germans would begin by attacking between Karlsruhe and Luxenbourg, withthe object of driving in the French troops which had advanced up to the Siegfried Line.   There might thenbe a pause to prepare an atta.ck on the Maginot Lineitself, on which the French would fight theirdefensive battle.   Perhaps simultaneously, or even before the attack on the Maginot Line, the germans might advance through Luxembourg, opposite which therewas already a considerable concentration.   general gamelin was determined not to offer an encounterW.M.(59) 40th CONCLUSIONS T MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.

battle in Luxembourg, though he was anxious to keepthe enemy out of the Longwy area as long as possible.All these operations, he thought, would be a preliminary to a main thrust through the Low Countries.By attacking the Maginot Line the Germans would hope topin down a considerable French force and thereby reducethe forces available to meet the main thrust in the north.General Gamelin thought the most serious feature of the German attack would be their air offensive againstthe back areas of the Armies and on French industry and communications.   This would seriously reduce the mobility of the French reserves.   He quite appreciated thatGreat Britain might be subjected to a simultaneous heavyair attack, or even the whole weight of the air attack.Accordingly, General Gamelin was anxious that the Britishfighter forces should be on as flexible a basis aspossible, in order to meet any threat which might develop.As regards the probable date of these german attacks General Gamelin had not been very definite, buthe thought that the initial attacks on the French forcesin front of the Maginot Line might develop within a few-days,   A heavy attack on the main Maginot Line could probably not be mounted under 15 to 50 days from now.As regards the attack on the Low Countries, he did notthink that it could take place under 15 days from now.The Germans would require for it, in his estimation, atleast 40 divisions.   They had put down extra bridgesacross the Rhine, but there was no sign yet of anydumping of large quantities of ammunition.    The dangerpoint would be over by the 10th November.   The Low Countriswould be the decisive front.   Any attack on the mainMaginot Line could only develop into a war of attrition.The Chief of the Air Staff had explained thearrangements which were already en train for augmenting

our fighter strength in Prance.   Two of the HurricaneSquadrons which now formed part of the,air component of the British Expeditionary Force were being sent tothe Verdun area, where they would be able to support theBritish Bomber Squadrons.   A base organisation to receivetwo Fighter Squadrons was already in France, and wouldbe in the B .E .F. area in&apos;two or three days ;   and twoGladiator Squadrons from A.D.G.B. could be transferredto France to occupy those......b*a*a-ee-^Hriaaja- six houro-df theIn addition, the Chief of the Air Staff had told the French that he was taking further measures to increasethe flexibility of our Fighter forces.   He was, forexample, preparing a second base organisation forHurricane aircraft, and he was having examined thepossibility of operating fighters over Belgium frombases in England.   He had emphasised that he could not be tied down to dates and numbers, but undertook to do allthat,-.he could to meet the French requests.   The french representatives had expressed satisfaction with these arrangements, and confidence that the British War Cabinet  Iwould give the Royal Air Force liberty to act as thesituation of the, moment might demand.At the conclusion of the above explanation, theChief of the Air Staff asked for War Cabinet authorityto be allowed to despatch the two Gladiator Squadronsmentioned above to Prance at his own discretion, andwithout further reference to the War Cabinet.   The WarCabinet agreed to give him this discretion.In reply to further questions, the Chief of theAir Staff explained that additional Fighter Squadronsfajom this country could work from aerodromes in Franceoccupied by squadrons of the same type;   but only atreduced efficiency.

Continuing the account of his conversation withthe French, the Chief of the Air Staff said that he had suggested to them that their warning system was not asefficient as our own, and that he had offered to take some of their personnel for instruction in R.D.F., andalso to siipply some R.D.F. equipment for use in theFrench back areas .There had been some discussion on the employmentof British bombers in delaying a German advance throughthe Low Countries.   The Chief of the Air Staff saidthat he had been anxious to know what, in the Frenchvie?/, would be the decisive point in such an advance,at which we should be prepared to face the heaviestcasua.lties .   He had pointed out that, at the time of theAnglo-French Conversations in London, the situationvisualised was that the French Army would be advancingrapidly into Belgium to take up a defensive position on the line as far forward as the Albert Canal, and inthis event a delay even of a. few hours of the Germancolumns might well have become of decisive importance and would have justified heavy losses.    If the Frenchdid not now intend to make more than a limited advance to the Scheldt Line, it did not appear that there wasthe same urgency for delaying action in the early stages of an invasion.General Vuillemin considered that,  if the belgians  called for our assistance in time to enablethe French to get to the Meuse-Albert Canal Line, weshould attack the Germans between the Rhine and theBelgia.n frontier.    If, as seemed more likely, the belgians did not inform us in time, we should have toattack the Germans after they had entered Belgium.General Gamelin said that it was difficult to sayprecisely until the time came when the Germans should be

attacked, or where.    It would be necessary to wait untilthe German plan disclosed itself.   He had made onerather interesting suggestion   that the Germans would perhaps attack and. occupy the Low Countries this autumn and. would, not attempt to advance into Prance. -Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,7th October, 1939 .

CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX....HOLLAND AND THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that the JointBELG TOM.Intelligence Sub-Committee had collected complete informa-Measures tobe taken in     tion about the resources of Holland and Belgium, and itthe Event ofan Invasion     would now be for Departments to prepare all possible by Germany.steps to be taken in the event of a German invasion ofthe Low Countries .    In view of the complicated nature ofthe problem, the Chiefs of Staff recommended that a minister should be appointed to act as prime-moverin the matter.   Some of the action would have to be takenby the French, and the Permanent Military representatives had already been instructed to examine the question withtheir French colleagues.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that actionto be taken by the Admiralty was already under preparation,and a Captain had been earmarked to proceed, in case of necessity, to each of the main ports in the Low Countries.Ways and means of dealing with bullion and seeuri-ties were discussed.    It would be desirable to move thebullion forthwith.   We would no doubt like to see itremoved to this country, but the Dutch and Belgian Govern-ments might wish to send it to the United States ofAmerica.   This presented practical difficulties.   Theeasiest country to which to move the gold would, be France.It was generally agreed that the best channel of communi-cation would be found to be the Bank of England, which wasin very close relationship to the Central Banks of holland and Belgium.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE said that,earlier in the year, it had appeared that^scientists were on the point of discovering a method of utilising uranium,

11*JL jl JLand that steps had been taken to secure supplies from belgium.    It appeared now, however, that such hopeswere optimistic, and the removal of further uraniumore from Belgium did not appear to be a vital matter.The War Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Memorandum by the Chiefsof;Staff Committee:(b) To invite the Minister without Portfolioto co-ordinate the action of the various departments concerned with preparing plans,and to watch over the consultations withthe French:( c) To invite the Chancellor of the exchequer to ask the Bank of England to approach theCentral Banks of Holland and Belgium, witha view to securing the removal of theirgold to some safe place of custody,preferably to this  country.Richmond Terrace, S .W.1,7th October, 1939.-2-
