Confidential Annex.british THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that althoughAIR ACTION:POSSIBLE he had not yet had an opportunity of discussing theEXTENSIONOF SCOPE. question with the other Chiefs of Staff, he had reachedthe preliminary conclusion that the time might berapidly approaching when it would be necessary to greatlyextend the scope of British air action.      The information received from Poland,  showed that German air attacks were being directed not only against munitions factories,etc., but also against works of all kinds,  including evenpower stations.      He felt disposed, therefore,  toconsider that within the next few days, a large-scale attack of a similar character should be made by theR.A.F.  against Germany, notwithstanding (l) our relativeinferiority in numbers,  (S) the fact that the field force was on the point of being moved and (3)  the certainty of German retaliation on British factories inthis country.      The exact targets to be attacked inGermany would, of course, require most careful considera-tion.      An operation of this kind would,  in his  (theChief of the Air Staffs) opinion, render the most valuable contribution towards the final conclusion ofthe war.      If such an operation were decided upon,  astrong effort should be made to persuade the French tomake a determined effort simultaneously by land.      If theywere prepared to do so, he would agree to the fullest use being made of the Advanced Air Striking Force.      Itwould be essential that before such an operation werek carried out, public opinion in neutral countries shouldhave been thoroughly prepared.

The War Cabinet -(a) Took note that the possible extension ofthe scope of British air action, raised in a provisional way by the Chief ofAir Staff, would be considered later inthe day&apos;by the Chiefs of Staff Committee,who would submit a report thereon to theWar Cabinet for consideration;(b).Agreed that steps should at once be takento ensure that the Ministry ofInformation should give the fullestpublicity forthwith, to the wide range of targets attacked in Poland by theGerman Air Force, and similar matters.
