I6iHO CIRCULATION.- MOST SECRET -W.M.(59)  63rd CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.INVASION OPGREAT BRITAIN.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat it was suggested in Telegram No. 305 fromBelgrade that an attack might shortly he made onthis country in the form of the landing of a largeforce of parachute infantry, to he backed up by aseaborne expedition   the whole project beingcovered by the entire German Air Force.The plan appeared somewhat fantastic, but theCommittee had carefully considered to what extent it might be practicable.    They found that Germany hada number of aircraft approximately equal to thatmentioned in the Telegram, if all types were taken intoaccount.    She certainly had trained parachute infantry,and had carried out operations in Czechoslovakia and poland with them.    The execution of a plan of thiskind had been studied in 1937 by the Joint PlanningSub-Committee, who had considered it somewhat impro-bable, in view of the relative strength at sea;    butthe development of aerial warfare had changed theposition in the North Sea, a.nd it appeared that theassembly of a large fleet of transports, and theirconvoy across to the shores of this country undercover of very heavy a,ir attack, might be judged a.sufficiently promising venture to be acceptable toGermany in her present mood.The Committee had considered how the landing mightbe carried out, and thought tha.t the most likelyproceeding would be an attempt at entering a port-1

where disembarkation would be comparatively easy.   a landing on an; open beach could only be attempted atthis time of year on a calm day.The rough time-table might be.-(a) A heavy and sustained air offensive against our Air Force and Fleet.(b) A landing by parachutists, who would attempt to seize the port.( e) The launching of the seaborne expedi-tion to complete the work begun by thepara chut e infantry.The Committee had come to &amp;he conclusion that itwould be unwise to ignore the possibility of such an operation, though it would be und.esira.ble to allow theprospect to interfere with the main role of the Army,which was, to train itself to take the field.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY then described the Naval measures recommended to meet the possibilityof this invasion.   He said that action was already taking place to put the proposed dispositions intoeffect.. The heavy ships of the Home Fleet would, remainin the North.   After careful consideration, it had beenthemthought best not to bring ^on to the East coast, wherethey might be subjected to heavy damage.The Destroyer force in the Number and at Harwichwas being brought up to a strength of 35.   This wouldca.st a great strain on our convoy, escort, and anti-submarine forces, but only 8 of the Destroyers would, betaken from the Western Approaches.Four Cruisers would be placed at Rosyth, so asto be ready to act against the transports.Ten Subms.rines would form a screen along theWestern edge of the German minefield, across theprobable route of an expedition.A Submarine would, be sent to reconnoitre in the heligoland Bight.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said, that frequentreconnaissances would be undertaken over the german ports, and the North Sea, so as to try and gainInformation of any preparations being ms.de.The whole Bomber Force would be placed in a highstate of readiness in reliefs.The Fighter Command would, as usual, be in astate of readiness.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR pointed, out theimprobability of sueh an expedition.   We had had considerable experience of combined operations, andthe movement of forces across the seas, and. we knew what a. complicated and hazardous enterprise an opposedlanding was.   The chances of its miscarriage were verygreat, and the troops would land, without transport,food, reserves of ammunition, or artillery.   There was always the possibility that reports of this kind were put out by the Germans to conceal their real int. en-tions, which, in this case, might possibly be a sea-borne attack aga.inst Holland.The Army, however, were taking the followingpr e caut reactionary mea s ur es : -(a) There were 9 Divisions on the East coast of England, or 12 if Scotland was included.A mobile column was maintained in es.chDivisional Ares, on the East Coast, and steps would be taken to ensure that these were ready to meet a landing.(b) The strength of guards on all vulnerable points, which included aerodromes, docks,railways, etc., would be considered, andthey would be given an increased supplyo f ammunition.( c)  The Armoured Division, and. the 48th and51st Divisions (which were the territorial divisions most nearly ready to take thefield) would be supplied with their fullscale of ammunition, and would immediatelycarry out exercises in preparation for a move to the East coast to repel a landing.(d) The coast defences at East coast ports wouldbe studied, and, where thought necessary,would be reinforced with mobile artilleryto engage the transports.

(e) A preliminary study would be given toplans for bringing back Divisions from France.THE MINISTER OP HOME SECURITY drew attention tothe role, which might be fulfilled by the police, ifthey were forearmed.   He undertook to confer immediatelon the subject with the Commander-in-Chief, Home forces the MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat the Germans must count for success on surprise.If the convoy sailed during the night, our Destroyerswould certainly sink a great number of the transports,as they were thoroughly versed in night work.    By day,however, they might be driven off by German heavy shipsHe thought that this  contingency pointed to the desira-bility of having at least one of our Capital Ships atthe Forth.   He thought also that, as the weatherentered so largely into the plan, a weather forecastwould be useful every morning.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that hewould anxiously consider with the Naval Staff the dispositions of our Capits.1 Ships, but it must beremembered that we were fighting this war with last war&apos;s ships, which were not designed against heavy air attack.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,28th October, 1939.-4-
