CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX.W.M. (39), 12th Conclusions, Minute 6.AIR The War Cabinet had under consideration a ReportPOLICY.by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on Air Policy(Paper No. W.P.  (39) 19).At the request of the Prime Minister,  the Chiefof the Air Staff went briefly through the Report calling attention to the salient points, and supplementing it with the following explanations:-Paragraph 4 &quot;8&quot;.Time was emphatically on our side.    taking into account the potential aircraft productionresources of the whole Empire - including,  inparticular, the Canadian contribution, theexpansive power of our industry would becomerelatively greater than that of Germany, whilstGermany would gradually suffer from a shortageof raw materials which would not only affect the morale of the armed forces, but also that ofthe civil population.    Every day that passedwould improve our position.Paragraph 10.If we decided to extend air action beyondthe limits of our present bombardment instructions,it was emphasised that we must do so in full andwithout any restrictions, other than those whichwe should always observe, such as refraining fromindiscriminate bombing.Paragraph 11.It was agreed that if and when we decided togo beyond our present bombardment instructions,the qualification that &quot;our policy   should bealways; to keep one step behind the Germans&quot;should not apply to the selection of a target,which we should be free to choose as we thought fit.Paragraph 13.A Report which the Chief of the Air Staff hadreceived that day appeared to confirm the view thatthe Germans were making an honest effort to restricttheir bombing to military objectives.    The factthat they might have made mistakes was in thenature of the hazards of air warfare.    The PolishMission now in this country corroborated the viewthat the Germans were trying to abide by the rules.

Paragraph 20.Our present bombardment policy would not preclude us from carrying out bombing attacks insupport of the French offensive within the limits of our bombardment instructions.    We had not, as yet, carried- out any such attacks in deference to- General Gamelin&apos;s anxiety that he must firstcomplete his concentrations.   We were, however,carrying out reconnaissances with a view tobombing attacks later.Paragraph 22,Our present 30 per cent,  reserve of modernfighters did not include the Immediate Reserveheld by squadrons.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR hoped that theWar Cabinet would adopt the recommendations in theReport.    It was unthinkable that we should initiateunrestricted air attack on Germany.    We had to rememberour pledge to President Roosevelt and nothing had yetoccurred which would justify departure from that pledge.There was the strongest military argument for holdingwhat we had to support the French offensive when theymight need it.    In the event of peace proposals being put forward by the German Government when Poland had been defeated, we should be in a much stronger position torefuse them if, on the one hand, we still possessed our air force intact, and on the other hand, had not usedit in such a manner as might expose us to criticism.Finally,  if, as the Chief of the Imperial General staff had said, we were in for a period of stalemate,  it wouldbe of paramount advantage to us that we should employ thisbreathing space to build up our resources.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY agreed, pointing out that the choice did not really rest with us,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL was sure that the Chiefsof Staffs&apos;  conclusion was right.    Nevertheless, he foresawa difficulty in persuading the French of this.    As their

2 i.casualties mounted, they would understandably ask why we were holding back and making no use of the one weaponwith which we could retaliate.    It was therefore desirablethat everything should be done to make it clear to theFrench that we were pressing on with our arrangements tosupport them with our army.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR suggested thatour policyj as set out in the Report, should becommunicated to General Game1in with the reminder thatit was in consonance with what had already been agreed with the French, but that he should be asked on no account to divulge it.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that the corollary to our accepting this air policy should be an intensification of blockade.The War Cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve the policy for theemployment of our main air striking force as recommended by the Chiefsof Staff in their Report on air policy (Paper Ho. W.P.  (39) 19).(b) That this policy should be communicatedconfidentially to General Gamelin bythe Chiefs of Staff, with a reminderthat it conformed with the generalstrategic policy already agreed upon between ourselves and the French, andthat General Gamelin should be particularly requested not to divulgethis information.&apos;
