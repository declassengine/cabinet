W.M.(39) kkm. CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 10.Confidential Annex.*        9        9THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to Telegram No. 660, dated 24th October,1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington,reporting, the activities of Mr James Mooney, Vice-President of General Motors, who was doing his best to spread the idea that Field Marshal Goering was aperson with whom it would be possible for the allies to deal.   He (the Secretary of State) had receivedfurther information on the same subject the previous evening from M. Corbin, the French Ambassador, whohad shown him a telegram describing an interviewbetween Mr Bullitt, the American Ambassador in Paris,and Mr Mooney.    The latter had claimed to have hada two hours talk with Field Marshal Goering, in whichthe latter had argued that, as we could not hope tobreak the Siegfried Line any more than they (theGermans)  could hope to break the Maginot Line, itwas folly to continue the war.    Field Marshal Goeringhad intimated that the German Government would beprepared to consent to the restoration of a PolishState and of a Czech State, both, however, to be under German influence.    In his (the Field Marshal1s)opinion, the British, French and German governments should now arrange for responsible Statesmen of thethree countries to meet in secret on some neutralterritory for the purpose of negotiating an arrange-ment.   He (Field Marshal Goering) had asked Mr Mooneyto pass on what he had said to the American Ambassadors

X D Din Paris and London.   On receiving this informationMr Bull it t had informed Mr Mooney that there was no prospect whatever of an advance on these lines.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the interest ofthis report lay in the fact that it suggested thatthe German Government had not yet abandoned all hopeof an early pea.ce.    This could only be regarded as a sign of weakness on their side.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statement.R i ehmon d Terrace, S .W .1,26th October, 1939.-2-
