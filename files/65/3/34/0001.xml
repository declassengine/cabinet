THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said.that he had received from a secret but reliable source in Italy a report which showed that theItalian Army, Navy and Air Force were ranged insolid support of the King and Crown Prince in opposition to any proposal for the entry by Italyinto the war on the side of Germany.   There was muchpro-French sentiment in the Army, and very littlerancour was entertained, in regard, to Tunis, which,it was felt, was a problem which could be solved, atthe proper time between Italy and. France.   What was desired, however, was a reasonable solution in regardto Suez Canal dues, and also in regard to DJibuti.It was very important that Italy should, receive help from the Allies, and particularly from this  country,in her present economic difficulties.    If such helpwere given, there would very soon be a marked swing-over of public sentiment in Italy to the side of theAllies.   The report concluded, by saying that theabove expectation regarding the result of allied assistance to Italy in the economic sphere was heldwidely in influential circles in Italy.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statement.

W.M. (59)  68nd CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 9.Confidential Annex...*      *      *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat certain remarks made by Jonkheer Teixeira de,Mattos, the Counsellor of the Netherlands Legation,at an interview the previous day at the ForeignOffice, threw an interesting light on German-italian relations.    It appeared that a Netherlands delegation in Berlin, on being pressed by the Germans to supplyraw materials from the Netherlands East Indies, had indicated that they would be willing to do this,provided that Germany supplied the necessary shipping,or, alternatively, arranged for the materials&apos; to beconsigned through Italy.    On the latter suggestionbeing ms.de, the German representatives had declaredabruptly that any such proposal was entirely out ofthe question, and had at once entered into a longdiatribe against Italy.As regards the internal situation in Germany,the Secretary of State said, that, according to a highly secret and reliable source of information,there was acute disagreement between Herr hitler and leading Generals in the Army, who were anxious that Herr Hitler should put forward concrete proposalsfor peace of a kind which might win serious  consideration-tion from the Allies, even if it were necessary for germany to make certain sacrifices.   This attitude on the part of the Generals was due to their convie-tion that recent developments in Eastern Europeamounted to a debacle, for Germany.   They were anxiousto be freed from their responsibilities in the West,in order that Germany might be able to devote greater

  tJ 9attention to her interests in the East.    It appeared that up to the date of the present report (13 th Octo-ber, 1939) the Generals had achieved no success;Herr Hitler was making the wildest promises regardinghis intention and power to bring us to heel, and was,at the same time, making the strongest possibleappeals for unity in Germany.The -War Cabinet took note of theabove statement.Ri richmond T terrace ce, S .W .1,27th October, 1939.
