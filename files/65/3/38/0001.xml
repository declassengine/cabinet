W.M.(59)  66th OONOLUSIQNST MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.POSSIBILITY of sea-BORNE ANDAIR-BORNEATTACK on great BRITAIN.(previous reference:W.M.(39) 65thConclusions,minute e 3 .)(W.M.(Z9) 63 rdConclusions,minute e 5 .)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR drew attentionto the great expense and inconvenience to the civilpopulation which would he caused if steps were now taken to requisition the motor transport required toplace two Divisions on a mobile basis.    Investigationhad shown that a very large amount of transport wouldbe required, and the General Staff were of the opinionthat measures on the scale proposed were altogetherunnecessary in present circumstances.The War Cabinet were informed that there were inthis  country many times more troops than were necessaryto meet the contingency of a possible raid from germany more detailed examination of the problem would almost certainly show that full security could begiven against this threat at a. much smaller cost than would be involved in the scheme which had beenapproved.by the War Cabinet at the Meeting referredto in the margin.The discussion then turned on the measures necessary to deal with an air-borne raid.    It waspointed out that the Germans were known to have 4,000trained parachutists, and that this force, if used inconjunction with a heavy and sustained air attack onthis  country, might be able to cause serious damage tovital munitions industries.    Such damage might slowup the production of the equipment for the newDivisions, and might delay their ultimate readiness for war far more than the interruption to the trainingof these formations which would result from theirre-disposition to meet the threat of a raid. There

were certain important areas in the country in whichthe numbers of troops available to deal with such a threat were very Small.   It was believed that theGerman plan for such an operation would be to useparachute troops to seize an aerodrome on which troop-carrying aircraft could then be landed.On the other hand, it was argued that the technical difficulties of landing troops from parachutes were very great.    They could not be rapidly concentratedafter landing, and could probably be dealt with indetail.    In any case the danger would, be a purely-local one, and provided, that there were small mobileforces available within reasonable distance, these,in conjunction with the guards on aerodromes and othervital points, would probably be sufficient.   TheCommander-in-Chief at home was examining this problem in detail, and there seemed no reason to believe thatits solution would present any great difficulty.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that he hadnot been greatly disturbed by the original report which had led on the 27th October to an urgent reviewof our home defence arrangements .    On the other hand.&apos;,he was not at all sure that these arrangements as awhole had received sufficient consideration.   the review which had. taken place had disclosed the weakness of our Naval forces operating off the East Coast, andthe absence of mobile artillery with the land forces,in the East of England.   Nothing would do more to upset our programme for the despatch of forces overseasthan an attempted, raid,  even though this might proveunsuccessful.   Provided, however, that our homedefence organisation was on a thoroughly sound basis,there wa.s no reason why we should, be alarmed by thesesudden reports .

Generalv agreement was expressed with, this view.The suggestion that it might be possible to takeadequate stels to deal with the threat of a sea-borneraid at 8. smaller cost for requisitioned transport,and with less \disturba.nce to civil industry, wascordially welcomed.    It was recalled, in this connee-tion that the G rma,ns had never carried out a combined operation involving land and sea forces working inconjunction,  except at Libau, when their arrangements had. broken down badly.    Such an operation was an extremely complicated matter, requiring greatexperience and very careful preparation.    It would,not, however, be safe to assume that the nega.tiveresults of air reconnaissance over Worth West Germanynecessarily showed that the danger of an expeditionhad. altogether passed,    it would not, therefore, be wise to cancel on this a.account all the arrangements which had been agreed, upon at the Meeting previouslyreferred to.    If the Admiralty felt, that they couldnot maintain indefinitely the increased strength of destroyers in the North Sea. which had been decided upon, the First Lord would, no doubt ra.ise the questionlater, when he considered the time appropriate.Richmond Terrace, S..W.L,51st October, 1939.&apos;*&amp;riA%:-rV:^ X:A.^X7A&apos;;4:s:A:%:7A^
