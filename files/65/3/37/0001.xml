Confidential Annex.SECURITY OPFLEET BASES..(previous reference?W.M.(39) 52ndConclusions,Minute 5...)THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that, as atemporary expedient, it was proposed to base the Fleeton the Clyde.   Under present arrangements the Fleet, whichcomprised the battleships NELSON and RODNEY and the battle-cruiser HOOD, would reach the Clyde on the following morning.    The Admiralty felt that they were faced with amost important decision.    It must be taken as certain thatnews of the Fleet&apos;s arrival in the Clyde would get through to Germany in a few hours.   Part of the Fleet would besent to sea again as soon as possible after refuelling.But it required some thirty hours to reach the North Seafrom the Clyde, during which period only light naval forces would be available for dealing with any Germanoperations in the North Sea.    The Admiralty, however,thought that the Germans would not run the risk involvedin bringing the SCHARNHORST or GNEISENAU near to. our coast.The Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, was not inentire agreement with the policy which the Admiraltyproposed to adopt in regard to the Fleet bases to be usedin the immediate future, and would, prefer to base theFleet on Scapa Flow.   He (the First Lord) therefore proposed to go to the Clyde with the First Sea Lord, todiscuss the matter with the Commander-in-Chief on thefollowing morning.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that he feltthat the First Lord&apos;s decision to base the Fleet on the clyde was the right one, although it placed a very heavyresponsibility and. burden on the Royal Air Force. It hadthe great advantage of giving the Fighter Squadrons a-1-

chance of intercepting at least a proportion of theGerman bombers before they reached their objective.Another advantage (though this was of less importance)was that it gave them greater opportunity for attackingthem on their way home.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE viewed the proposal to leave our East Coast devoid of capital ships with misgiving.   He thought that the Admiralty wereright not to take any avoidable risk with the HOOD, whichcould be of inestimable value for operations in the atlantic.    The NELSON and RODNEY&quot;, however, had been specially built to 7/ithstand attack from the air.   Hethought that we should accept the challenge and base atleast one Capital Ship at Rosyth - the NELSON.for prefer-once, as she was the better protected ship of the two.He felt that the Government would lay themselves open tograve criticism if either an attack by surface shipsagainst our shipping in the North Sea, or a large-scaleraid, supported by German Capital Ships, on our coast-were to take place and we had no Capital Ships availableto deal with them.    If the German Capital Ships couldremain at Wilhelmsheven, surely ours could remain atRosyth.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR thought that itmight be misleading to compare our position and theGerman position too closely-    In their case the inflictionof heavy losses on our Fleet was a prize they might wellconsider worth the loss of a large number of bombers;we, on the other hand,  could not afford heavy losses inour smaller bomber force for the sake of putting theirtwo Battle Cruisers out of action.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE pointed,out that the German Battle Cruisers were the only capital ships which the Germans possessed.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY emphasised thatbasing the Fleet in the Clyde was only a temporarydisposition.    Two more Battleships would shortly beadded to the Home Fleet, and it was later intended,that the Fleet should, work in two watches, of which one would always be at sea in the Northern Approaches.THE CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF suggested thathistory was repeating itself.    Just as in the past the advent of the submarine had. rendered close blockade; &apos;  &apos;;:&apos;.;;&apos;y.         &apos; &apos;&apos;.V;&apos;-:;!-&apos;,;       %iyiV/: :: y        ?fi, &apos;&apos; i&apos;&apos;:i&apos;y&apos;:&apos;-&apos;:     &apos;&apos;  ii,&apos;.1     - - :.V &apos;^ &apos;impracticable, so now bombing aircraft had forced theblockading country to withdraw its forces even furtherout.    Up to the present, it was true, no Capital ship had. been hit by a bomb;    but there had been some closeshaves, and., in his opinion, it would not be right tosend Capital Ships within 100 miles of the German coast.He did not think that the Germans, for their part, wouldbe prepared to risk their Capital Ships near our coast.They would be playing into our hands if they did so.Moreover, if they lost their only two Capital Ships,they would be powerless to prevent the complete domina.-tion of the Baltic by Russia.He thought it far more likely, however, that ifa German force were sent against this country, it wouldbe covered, at the outset by the German Battle Cruisers,which would be withdrawn later. The Germans would hopethat our Cs.pital Ships would thereby be drawn into theSouthern part of the North Sea and would expose themselveto a tremendous weight of air attack.    If the germans could succeed in putting the NELSON, RODNEY and HOODout of action, they would be in a position to attackour Northern Patrol and break the stranglehold of theblockade.   It might be several weeks before we couldWARSPITE from the Mediterranean, andVALIANT    from dockyard hands after reconstruction.

(previous reference:W.M.(39) 52ndConclusions,Minute 5.)withdraw Capital Ships from elsewhere and re-establishour- position.    Tn his opinion, the Clyde was a much saferbass for the Fleet than Rosyth.    Up to the present, A.A.fire from the Fleet had been disappointing, and he feltthat reliance must be largely placed on fighter aircraft.By basing the Fleet in the Clyde, the Fighters would begiven a much better chance.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that the War Cabinet-had only recently been made aware of the Admiralty&apos;decision to use Rosyth as the Fleet base.   He askedwhether the Admiralty&apos;s views had now changed.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY agreed that theNaval Staff had now changed their views.    It was possiblethat the air menace was over-rated, but the experienceof the war tended to show that the Admiralty had viewed the position too optimistically in the past.   As recently as the Spring of this year it had been asserted in theHouse of Commons by the Admiralty spokesman that theAdmiralty had complete confidence in the ability of theFleet to withstand air attack.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE pointedout that the Admiralty had never claimed that the olderCapital Ships were proof against bombing attack.    It&apos; had only been asserted that their strengthened A.A. armamentwas sufficient to drive the bombers up to a height atwhich they would not be able to make accurate bombing attack.    The experience of the war so far, and particular-ly the a-attack on the East Coast convoy, had borne this outTHE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed out that onedetermined low-flying attack had been made on theARK ROYAL, and. it was extremely fortunate that she had.not been hit.THE PRIME MINISTER observed that, from what had been said by the Chief of Naval Staff, he inferred-4-

that even if Capital Ships were based on Rosyth, theAdmiralty would not be prepared to send them into theSouthern part of the North Sea.   He asked if this would hold good in the event of a German expedition setting saila,ccompanied by the German Battle Cruisers.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that the NELSON andRODNEY would be sent out if it was definitely known thatthe German Battle Cruisers were coming to our coast.He did not think, however, that the Germans would do this.As to the expedition itself, a surprise landing at dawnprovided the only hope of success.    It was universallyaccepted as impracticable to effect an opposed landing in the face of an undefeated Air Force.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether,  in the circumstances-stances, it would not be better to abandon any further increase in the defences at Rosyth and concentrate on thedefence of Scapa.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that it wouldbe some time before the defences of Scapa were ready.At. least six weeks would, be required to complete the anti-submarine defences.   The present intention was to makeScapa. a safe anchorage from the point of view of submarineattack, and to prepare the gun emplacements so that alarge number of guns could, be installed at short notice,when required.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that Scapa was noth?uf a? tU fe leaf&apos; t 4*sso well placed, s^-^&amp;e^is^xn the last, war we had alwaysknown, by the interception of signa.ls, whenever the german fleet put to sea.   We were no longer able to obtain this information, and, without it, ships working from a baseas far north as Scapa could hardly hope to intercept any german ships which came out.On the question of the relative merits of Rosythand scapa as a safe anchorage, THE CHIEF OF THE AIR staff pointed out that Fighter reinforcements could be sent

either to the Clyde or to Rosyth in the course of anaerial battle if a big battle developed.   This, however,was not possible in the ease of Scapa.   As between the clyde and Rosyth, if the Fleet was on the Clyde, our fighters would have a much better chance of interceptingenemy aircraft before they could attack the Fleet.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that his personal view ha.d always been in favour of basing theFleet on Rosyth and making the anchorage there as safe aspossible.    There were, however, two arguments in favourof the Clyde, the force of which he could not deny.    Thefirst was the greater power of intercepting attack on theway: the second was that we were not likely to gain muchby stationing Capital Ships on the East Coast.THELORD PRIVY SEAL was disturbed at the apparentichange in policy since the previous week.    It ha.d then been decided that we should base the Fleet on Rosyth.It now appeared, however, that for the time being we shouldhave no ships nearer than the Clyde.    In his view, thepresence of Capital Ships at Rosyth would have a valuabledeterrent effect against any form of surface attack onour coasts.   He was reluctant to accept the proposal.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR remarked that theWar Office had just been asked to give serious considera-tion to the possibility of invasion.    The withdrawal ofthe Fleet from the East Coast would increase the chances of the G-erma.ns attempting an attack on our coast.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that,  in viewof what had been said during the discussion, the WarCabinet might desire the Admiralty to give furtherconsideration to their policy.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that the matter required further discussion, but he suggested that this shouldtake place after the conference between the First lord and the Oommander-in-Ohief.-S-

Possibility &apos; Later in the proceedings THE SECRETARY OP STATEof SeaborneLand Invasion.   FOR WAR said that the projected invasion of Great Britainlp was being well advertised in a number of reports arrivingfrom the Continent, which tended to discredit the possi-bility of such an invasion.   Government offices in Berlinwere reported, however, to have moved to their war stations,which might be consistent with some intention which wouldbe likely to invite retaliation.In reply to a question, THE. CHIEF OF THEIMPERIALGENERAL STAFF said that, so far a.s could be ascertained,the report of a.n alleged assembly of flat-bottomed boats,which might be used for an attack on Holland, wa.s true.From the purely military point of view, an attack of this nature would be perfectly feasible.As regards preparations in this country, THESECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that all troops had. beenissued, with the full scale of war ammunition.    transport had been requisitioned to enable the 48th and 51st divisions to be moved rapidly to the coast if necessary.   The armoured division was also prepared to move at short notice.The War Cabinet agreed  (l) To approve the arrangements made by theAdmiralty for the Home Fleet to proceedto the Clyde on the following day:(2) That, 8-fter the forthcoming discussion between the First Lord of the admiralty and the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet,further consideration should be given tothe Admiralty&apos;s proposal that for the timebeing no Capital Ships should be based, onthe East Coast.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,30th October, 1939.-
