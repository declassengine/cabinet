A limited portion at thewestern end of the Galician oilfield had been destroyed, but the remainder of the oilfield was understood to be intact.      It was now too late tosend British Officers from Roumania to Poland fordemolition purposes, since this would endanger our preparations for the destruction of the Roumanianoilfields.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said thathe regarded the information now reported,as beingextremely disappointing.      He had, himself, on several occasions before and since the outbreak of war,inquired as to the adequacy of the arrangements forthe destruction of the Polish oilfields, and he      fregarded it as very regrettable that no effective action had in fact been taken.The War Cabinet,-took note of theabove discussion.
