MINUTE 5.GAL10IANOILFIELDS.(previous reference:W.M.(39)  18thConclusions,Minute 7.)Reference was made to the discussion on thismatter at the previous Meeting of the War Cabinet,when the Deputy Chief of the Imperial General staff stated that only a limited portion of the Galicianoilfields had been destroyed.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that,although he had no certain knowledge, he felt confident that it would be found that steps had been taken to destroy the wells before they fell into German hands.An Officer of great determination had been deputedfor this task, who would, he felt sure,  carry it through if it was humanly possible to do so.ROUMANIANOILFIELDS.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF informed the War Cabinet that the &quot;British party&quot; under GeneralNeedham, referred to in Telegram 610 from H.M.Ambassador at Alexandria, which was waiting at alexandria to go to Roum&amp;nia, was the party detailedto destroy the Roumanian oil wells .The War Cabinet took note ofthis statement.

CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX TO W.M.  (39) 19th CONCLUSIONS.MINUTE 5.(Supplementary to circulated version.)STAFFCONVERSATIONSWITH BELGIUM.(previous reference:W.M.   (39) 16thConclusions,Minute 13.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Report bythe Chiefs of Staff on the subject of Staff Conversa-tions with Belgium (W.P.  (39) 32).THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff explained that the reluctance of the Belgians to enterinto Staff Conversations had created a very difficult situation for the British Expeditionary Force.     If theBelgian Government maintained its attitude and refusedStaff Conversations and the Germans suddenly launcheda heavy attack through the Low Countries, we shouldhave to harden our hearts and resist the appeal whichwould inevitably follow to come to Belgium^ assistance.Unless we did so we should become involved in anencounter battle against heavy German mechanised forces,and our Expeditionary Force would be faced with asimilar situation as in 1914, which was the thing wemost wished to avoid.      Our plans ought to envisage two stages.     First, what our immediate action should be ifBelgium continues her refusal to enter into conversations and, secondly, the building up of a heavily protectedFranco-Belgian frontier.     The existing defences on the franco-Belgian frontier were inadequate and onlyreached as far as Givet.     From Givet onwards to thesea there were only light field defences.     At thepresent time there was doubt as to what part of the line the British Expeditionary Force would take up their position.     A number of important administrative problems hinged upon this question.      The Commander-in-Chief would shortly be carrying out a reconnaissance.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed out thatif the Germans advanced through Holland and Belgium we

must be reacly to attack them with air forces immediatelythey debouched into the Low Countries.     Any hesitation in-taking the decision would mean the loss of an opportunityto attack the oncoming Germans while they were vulnerable.But it would have to be accepted that our air attackswould entail casualties to Belgian civilians in the villagesthrough which the enemy would be passing.This aspect of the operatons would be referred toin the appreciation which the Chiefs of Staff weresubmitting for consideration by the War Cabinet on thefollowing day.(The rest of this Minute is as appears in the normal circulation version.)September .18th, 1939.

CONFTDENTIAL ANNEX TO W.M.(g9)  19 .IS.    THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs made a statement in regard to the position in the balkans in the course of which he made the followingpoints:-(a) It was desirable to secure Balkan neutralityif this were practicable, but we should keep ourselves free from unnecessarycommitments as to our attitude in the eventof a conflagration in the Balkans,(b) If war broke out in the Balkans, this country would want all the friends she could get,and it would be essential that we should be free to send aid to those countries whichsided with us.(c) The present urgency of this matter lay inthe attitude to be taken up towards Bulgariaowing to the fact that H.M.  the King had,on advice, addressed a letter to the King of bulgaria assuring him that Bulgarianneutrality would be respected in the fullest possible way, provided it was not violatedby Germany.(d) This letter had not yet been delivered,and at the suggestion of the First Lord ofthe Admiralty, he (the Secretary of State)had directed that it should be held uppending further consideration of the matter by the War Cabinet.In the course of the discussion whichensued, the following considerations were brought forward:-(i) If Roumania were to be attacked by Germany,and Turkey came to her aid in accordancewith her Treaty obligations, Turkey couldonly do so if she could move her troops through Bulgaria, since it appeared that shewas quite incapable of arranging for their transport by sea.(ii) In the circumstances contemplated in (i)above, it was much to be hoped that Bulgariawould agree to the passage of Turkish troopsover her territory, but that, if she refusedto do so, a situation might arise in whichTurkey would violate Bulgarian territory.(iii) In view of (ii) above, the undertaking tobe given to the King of Bulgaria should notbe such as to make it necessary for us to repudiate the action of Turkey, it being understood, however, that any aid which we might give to Roumania would probably be sent by sea.

(iv) As explained by the Chief of the Imperial.. General.staff, the French.plan for an.alliedseizure of Salonika did not contemplate theuse of that^port as the base for an entry intothe Balkans, but was intended merely to forestall Bulgaria or any other Power fromseizing the coast.   Owing to the badclimate and to the mountainous nature of thecountry, there were strong militaryobjections against making an assault on the balkans from Salonika.The War Cabinet agreedthat, in order not to prejudice theBritish position in the event of Txxrkeycoming to the aid of Roum&amp;nia on thelatter being attacked by Germany, theundertaking to be given to the King of bulgaria in regard to respectingBulgarian neutrality should be soworded as to be operative only so longas Bulgarian neutrality was notviolated by the Government of any other country.
