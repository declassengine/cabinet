THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat, with reference to the statement which he had made to the War Cabinet at the previous Meeting ofthe War Cabinet (W.M.(39) 38th Conclusions, Minute 8),he had reason to know that information regarding theactivities of Dahlerus had come into the possessionof the French Government and had eatised them someuneasiness.   Fortunately he (the Secretary of State)had informed the French Government regarding thepre-war activities of DaHerus at the time that theyoccurred, and it should therefore be no matter of surprise to the French Government that we should bein contact with him.    In order to forestall a request from the French Government for information regardingthe latest activities of Dahlerus, he (the Secretaryof State) had the previous afternoon (6th 0ctober,1939)seen M. Corbin, the French Ambassador, and had given him a general outline of the position on the lines which he had already reported to the War Cabinet.He (the Secretary of State) had added that he himself had only communicated this information to the WarCabinet at their meeting that morning, and that itwas only because he had been unsuccessful in attempting to fix an appointment that he had not communicatedthis information to him (M. Corbin) the previous day.The Secretary of State said that he had now received a further message from Dahlerus to the effectthat by staying where he was (i.e., in Berlin) he wassecuring consideration for the British point of view.

He Had also succeeded thereby in securing certain important &quot;comments and bearings&quot;.   He   (Dahlerus)proposed to give particulars regarding these &quot;commentsand bearings&quot; the following day (i.e., 6th October, 1939)through the Swedish Legation at The Hague;   he was also prepared to come to London for further discussions.To this message he (the Secretary of State) had sent a reply that it was not thought that it would be advantage-ous for him (Dahlerus) to proceed to London at thepresent time, and that any communica.tion which he might wish to make should be made through the Swedish Legationat The Hague.Ri richmond Terra ce, S.W .1,6th October, 1939.-2-
