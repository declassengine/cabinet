CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX TO W.H..(59)SO tig CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE&quot; 5,.MILITARYSITUATIONIN FRANCE.(previous reference:W.M.(39)  19 tilConclusions,Minute 4.)5.   In the course of discussion on this item theCHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF explained that,although there was no news of German movements from poland, westwards, General Gamelin was extremely nervousthat these might take place, and took the view thatif they did, and were followed by a German attack inforce, the crisis of the war might well arise withinthe next few weeks .The French centre was opposed by 115-130 german divisions.   General Gamelin did not fear an attackon the centre, but was extremely anxious about thepossibility of a German movement through Belgium.The line along the Belgian frontier between Givetand the sea was under the special command of a french general.   It at present consisted of a line of pill-boxes, which the French were in process of strengthen-ing wjith further fortifications, out it could not inany sense be said to be ready.   It was to be presumed that the Field Force would be taking up part of this line,! and it was very desirable that we should know the part assigned to us as soon as possible, since,for technical reasons concerned with the differencebetween the way in which British and French units werearmed^ -ohe preparation of it would require to be adapted to our methods.TJhe Chief of the Imperial Genera.1 Staff said thatthe French were working on the line with civilians .Lord Gort had been with Genera.1 Gamelin for 24 hours,and he hoped that he would be acfedta informed very shortly as to the part of the line which the british army would, be required to take up.   Lord Gort hadorders that digging should be started as soon as this information was obtained.

Alib seemed clear that General Gamelin envisaged the possibility of a major decision on the western front within the next few weeks.Meanwhile we had no information as to the extentto which the Belgians had mobilised.    In any eventtheir army could not be counted on to any great extent.Their defence depended primarily on a very thorough and extensive system of demolition which could beset off along the whole length of their frontierfrom a central point.The danger was that if a German attack was launched through Belgium, the cry would go up thatwe should march into Belgium to arrest the german advance.   This would be highly dangerous and quite impracticable.    If the Belgians desired our help,they must say so now in order that the necessarydispositions and preparations could be made, taking into account that, in conformity with our mobilisatior.plans, we could not be ready,on whatever line we tookup, until the 14th October.   Otherwise we shouldmake our plans to take up a position on the Franco-Belgian frontier, on the clear understanding thatwe should not be expected to move forward from itat some later date in order to come to the rescueof the Belgians.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,19th September, 1939.

MOST    SECRET. 0 42RCONFIDENTIAL ANNEX TO W.M.   (39) .20th CONCLUSIONS:    MINUTE 8.FUTURE COURSE THE MINISTER FOR 00-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEOF THE WAR:APPRECIATION enquired when the Chiefs of Staff envisaged that it by THE CHIEFSOF STAFF, would &quot;be possible for us to take the offensive;    and(Previous in what form this would be.      The Air situation wouldReferences:W.M.(39)  15th       not improve for a considerable time,  since the GermanConclusions,Minute 16, and rate of aircraft production would continue higher than16th Conclusions,Minute 9.) ours until well into the next year.      Moreover, theystarted with a very considerable preponderance of   &apos;  -air power.      It also appeared from the Paper that theGermans would retain superiority on land.      Was thereno possibility of the French talcing the offensive,supported by our air and land forces, say, bynext spring?THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF explained thatat the present time we. were In a weak position,since our base was not yet as secure as we would wish.Our air defences were far from complete, and our aircraft industry was more vulnerable to attack thanthat of Germany.      -When the air defences of GreatBritain were further advanced we should be in a better position to carry out offensive air operations,  eventhough the total number of our bomber aircraft was less than that of the Germans.      He could not give any specific date,  but it would not suit us to initiate a purely air offensive this year.      We were,of course, prepared to co-operate in any effectiveland operation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that ifa period of stalemate lasted throughout the winter,we should be in a much better position by March, bywhich time we hoped to have another 5,000 aircraft.

If the French aircraft production was added to our own,$he total was about the same as that of Germany.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that our best chance of obtaining superiority was in the air, but aconsiderable time would elapse under our&apos; present programme before we even achieved parity with theGermans.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR emphasised that the expansion of our air force and our land forces should proceed on parallel lines.      It was partof the German policy to employ their air and land forces in close co-operation.      If the Frenchsuffered a disaster on land, they might be put outof the war altogether.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thought thatthe Germans would more probably employ their air force against the aircraft industries and air forces of theFrench and ourselves, and try to put them out ofaction, before attempting a major offensive on landin France.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY pointed outthat the populations of the Germans and the Allieswere approximately equal.      The Germans, however,started with the disadvantage that they were short ofcertain vital materials, and some at least of theirpopulation were gravely disaffected.      It seemed probable, therefore, that after a few months,weaknesses would begin to show in the German militarymachine, however formidable it might appear now.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs expressed the view that the air would probably prove the decisive factor.      Sufficient strength in the air

might make German,:   victory on land an impossibility.On the other hand,  it was vital not to give the Frenchthe impression that we v/ere making no serious effort on land and were leaving them to suffer all the casulties..Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.,19th September,  1939.
