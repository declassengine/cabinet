MOST   SECRET.W.M.(59),  58th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.STAFF   CONTACTS THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY gaveWITH BELGIUM.the War Cabinet an account of a most secretMessage fromThe King of meeting at which he had been present the previousthe Belgians.night.     Sir Roger Keyes, who enjoyed an exceptionalconfidence in Belgium, had come to see him on theprevious evening in company with a M. Stein, whostated he was the bearer of the following specialmessage from the King of the Belgians.King Leopold was deeply worried.      Whilsthe realised that Belgium must be loyal to her neutrality, he foresaw that this neutrality mightbe violated at any moment.      Meanwhile, no prepara-tions were being taken to meet this contingency.For political reasons, which we would understand,the Belgian Government could take no action.      TheKing was therefore seriously considering thepossibility of himself taking the matter up secretlywith his Generals, excluding all knowledge of his action from his political and diplomatic advisers.The King had, in fact, already consulted GeneralDenis, the Belgian Commander-in-Chief, on thesubject, and was now anxious to know whether wewould be prepared to accept his personal invitation to enter into military Conversations as to what action we might take in concert with the Belgians inthe event of a German invasion of Belgium.The First Lord said that, as a first step, he was endeavouring to establish thebona-fides of M. Stein.      He understood that he was

a British subject, formerly of Austriannationality, and an economist by profession.     Hewas said to hold a position of special confidence in the Palace at Brussels, and himself claimed to enjoy special privileges which would enable him tointroduce secretly into the presence of the Kingany emissary we chose to send.      The First lord had accordingly arranged with Sir Version Kellthat the truth of M. Stein&apos;s story should be tested by the despatch of an envoy, who woulddeliver personally to the King, a message, theeffect of which would be to establish whether M. Steinwas speaking the truth in claiming to be thebearer of the message which he had given.      IfM. Stein&apos;s bona fides were confirmed by the return of our envoy with a personal message from the King,we would thereby have established a very valuableliaison, which we could follow up with asuggestion that our respective military represen-tatives should meet at an early date to discussmutual plans.      He suggested that this meeting might perhaps take place at sea, on one of our Ships.5th October, 1939.

MOST    SECRET.fa W.M.(S9)  38th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 8.CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX.GERMANY. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat He had received two further Telegrams from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, on the subject of the approaches made by Herr von Papen, the German ambassador in Ankara, through the Netherland Minister:-(i) In the first Telegram it was stated that the netherland Minister had been asked to add afurther point to the list enumerated in w.M.(39) 36th paragraph 4 of the Telegram which he (theConclusions, Secretary of State) had read to the WarMinute 8. Cabinet at the Meeting noted in the margin,namely:-&quot;Replacement of Herr Hitler by a parliamentary regime.&quot;Herr von Papen had shown great anxietyregarding statements in the British press that Marshal Goering would be completelyunacceptable from the British standpoint,since he was the only man in Germanycapable of acting in the direction contem-plated.   The Netherland Minister had beeninformed, in reply to a question, that itwas a matter of &quot;secondary importance&quot;whether Queen Wilhelmina, King Leopold orSignor Mussolini were to take the lead inthe contemplated initiative.   The NetherlandMinister had telegraphed to his Governmentasking whether he might arrange to meetHerr von Papen privately in Germany.    Sucha meeting was&apos; desired by Herr von Papen,who considered that no-one in authority inGermany at the present time had any knowledgeof foreign countries.In the same Telegram Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen had reported a statement by theItalian Ambassador that It was ridiculousfor Turkey to entertain any fear.as regardsItaly, who would never join hands with germany in a war.   The Italian Ambassador had addedthat in his opinion Germany was  &quot;finished&quot;.(ii) In the second Telegram Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen reported having been informed throughthe same source that Herr Hitler&apos;s Reichstagspeech had been cancelled.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs then made a statement as follows on what appeared to be  afeeler from the German side on the question of peace:-

Those members of the War Cabinet who had beenmembers of the Cabinet Immediately before thewar would recall the activities, in the daysimmediately prior to the outbreak of war, of aSwedish business man named Dahlerus, who hadconstituted himself as a channel of communica-tion between Marshal Goering and ourselves,and had, according to his own account,struggled hard to prevent the outbreak of war.It was he who, at 10 .45 a.m. on the morningon which war began, had telephoned to ask him(the Secretary of State) whether we should regard it as helpful if Marshal Goering wereto fly over to England, to which suggestionhe had been given the answer - We had put aplain question to Germany and it should bepossible for Germany to return a plain answerwithout Marshal Goering or anyone else flyingto England.    The previous week (on the 29thSeptember, 1939) Dahlerus had appeared again and had informed him (the Secretary of State)that he (Dahlerus) had seen Herr Hitler and marshal Goering on the 25th September, 1939,and that Marshal Goering was willing, if theSecretary of State approved, to go to a rendez-vous in some neutral country and there meet an intermediary nominated by the British Govern-ment.    In this  connection the name of Sir EdmundIronside, Chief of the Imperial General Staff,had been mentioned.   The object of this meeting would be to discuss the guarantees which wouldbe necessary before any progress could be made towards peace.   At the same interview Dahlerushad produced a series of heads which it wassuggested might form a basis of discussion.The Secretary of State had replied that while some of the proposed hes.ds appeared not unhelp-ful, the fundamental difficulty was that no-one in this country was prepared to believe a wordthat Herr Hitler said.    It was, therefore,for the German side to suggest means of over-coming this difficulty.   For his part he hadno suggestions to offer.Dahlerus had thereupon returned to Germany,but two nights before (the 3rd October, 1939)he had telephoned from the British Legationat The Hague to say that, he had had furtherprolonged discussions and that further pro-posals had been elaborated.   Would it, there-fore, be agreeable for him to return to england for the purpose of discussing these proposals at a secret meeting to be held on Thursday,5th October, at 19.00 hours? &apos; He nad addedthat if the answer was in the affirmative,account might be taken of this attitude inthe speech which Herr Hitler was to deliverto the Reichstag on Friday, the 6th October,1939 .The Secretary of State, after consulting the Prime Minister, had replied that it was quite impossible for him to form any judgmentas to whether it was worth while for Dahlerusto visit this  country as proposed, since this

depended upon information which was in his possession but not in ours.   He had addedthat our attitude had been made perfectly clear in the conversations with him (Dahlerus)the previous week.    If, however, he cared tocome, arrangements would be made to see him.Since the despatch of the above reply, a communication had been received from Dahlerusstating that he had been delayed, and that hewould not in any case be coming to London fora day or two.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsconsidered that it was impossible to decide, at that stage, what importance, if any, should be attached tothese communications.    In his view, our policy shouldbe to hold a stiff attitude in the face of any suchcommunications, but that we should not absolutely shutthe door and should leave all initiative to the other side.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL inquired whether, in thecircumstances, it might not be well to damp down alittle our anti-Goering propaganda?THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he thought this might be so, since our real object was to destroy Herr Hitler.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that theseGerman feelers might not be sincere and their real objectmight be to spread division and doubt amongst us.    Ifthey were insincere, it was likely that they would shortly be followed by a suggestion of some time limit,and when that time limit was passed xve should certainlyexpect the most bitter fighting.    If, on the other hand,these feelers were sincere, they came, not from any sense of magnanimity, but from weakness, the present Germanleaders finding themselves unable to drag the Germanpeople into a war to destroy the Western Democracies.In that event we should need to be most providentstewards of the national interest, and to take everystep to ensure that we were not deceived.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he shared the viewof the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that ourcorrect course would be to hold a stiff attitude inthe face of these communications.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS saidthat he proposed to circulate to the War Cabinet aTelegram which he had received from General Smuts, whohad expressed the opinion that if the Germans were now tomake a peace offer they would not do so sincerely, but with the object of causing weakness amongst us.    It was true, of course, that General Smuts could not be aware of the latest developments in Germany.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, according to hisbelief, fear of Communism was now the most potentmo t ive in G ermany.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that, in anyapproaches such as those under discussion, the utmostcare should be taken to ensure that the avenue chosenwas reliable.   Dahlerus, who was generally regarded as a personal supporter of Marshal Goering, had many associatesin London, and the utmost care was necessary to maintainsecrecy as to his activities.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that in hisopinion Marshal Goering would be glad to secure theremoval of Herr Hitler, as he wished himself to live inpeace and luxury.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY agreed that marshall Goering might well cherish the idea of playingthe role of General Monk.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,5th October, 1939 .

81MOST    SECRET.PAN-AMERICANCONFERENCEAT PANAMA-Proposed&quot;Safety Belt&quot;.MessagefromPresidentRoosevelt.W.M.(39). 58th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 11.Confidential Annex.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY informed hiscolleagues that he had received a personal message ofa very friendly character from President Roosevelt.The President had stated that he would he glad at anytime to receive a personal message from the First Lordon any matter which the latter wished to bring to hisnotice.      He proposed that their exchange of corres-pondence should talee place in sealed envelopes conveyedby diplomatic bag.of the President that he was Commander-in-Chief of theUnited States Navy.     Mr. Roosevelt took an immensepride in his tenure of this post, and he was personallyresponsible for many of the moves of his ships.      Onlythe previous day Mr. Roosevelt had issued an Orderforbidding any publicity being given to such moves  -i.e.  an Order of a kind which in normal circumstanceswas only given when a country was on the point of declaring war.had dealt with the Pan-American Conference now being held in Panama City, and the proposal which had beenmade at that Conference for declaring a &quot;safety belt&quot;around the Americas, extending 300 miles out to sea,in which all belligerent activities would beoutlawed,  and all passenger and merchant ships of whatever nationality moving from one Americanport to another would be immune from attack.It was part of the constitutional positionAmong other matters, Mr.Roosevelt&apos;s letter

Theoretically,  the Navies of the South American Republicswould participate in the Naval patrol by which thedeclaration would be enforced.    In practice,  it was understood that the United States Navy would be responsiblefor its enforcement in both North and South Americanwaters.    It was understood that all the belligerentcountries were to be invited to conform with the &quot;safetybelt&quot; declaration.    We, of course,  should do so willingly.If Germany were to refuse, no great harm would be done.Herr Hitler would have quarrelled with Mr. Rooseveltand would have put himself in the wrong virith american public opinion.    The German   Navy would not,  in fact,be able to attack a British ship approaching, say, Jamaicaor Trinidad without risking hostilities with the UnitedStates.    It was understood that the &quot;safety belt&quot; proposaloutlawed action not only by belligerent vessels but action by ship-borne aircraft conveyed in such vessels.The Panama Conference proposal was thereforeone which would relieve the Royal Navy of a great loadof responsibility.    It would set more of our ships free -to take part in the Atlantic convoy.    The proposal wouldalso be helpful in connection with the tracing of theGerman pocket battleship which was reported to havebeen seen in American waters.    We had already begun thenecessary dispositions in the event of that ship leaving for African waters.The First Lord said that he had sent a suitablereply to Mr. Roosevelt.&apos;   There were, however, according tothe advice of the Naval Staff, a number of more detailedmatters in connection with the &quot;safety belt&quot; proposal which required examination, both from the Naval point ofview and from the point of view of international law.

The Pirst Lord read to the Cabinet a Paper&apos;on this matter which had been prepared by the Naval staff and which he proposed should be communicated informally to Mr. Roosevelt.    He proposed to arrange for this to .be done at once in order that the points dealt within this Paper might be known to Mr.  Roosevelt when he considered the resolutions passed at the Panama Conference.5th October, 1959.

Message sent by the First Lord of the admiralty to President Roosevelt.-------(Reference Conclusion 38(39), Conclusion 11.)The following from Naval person:&quot;We quite understand natural desire of UnitedStates to keep belligerent acts out of their waters.We like the idea of a wide limit of say 300 mileswithin which no submarines of any belligerent country should act.     If America requests all belligerents tocomply, we should immediately declare that we wouldrespect your wishes.     General questions of International Law would of course remain unprejudiced.     Moredifficulty arises about surface ships, because if araider operates from or takes refuge in the Americanzone, we should have to be protected or allowed toprotect ourselves.     We have mentioned several otherinstances to Mr. Kennedy.     We do not mind how farsouth the prohibited zone goes, provided that it iseffectively maintained.     We should have greatdifficulty in accepting a zone which was only policedby some weak neutral.     But of course if the AmericanNavy takes care of it, that is all right.Thirdly, we are still not sure whether raideroff Brazil is Scheer or Hipper, but widespread move-ments are being made by us to meet either case.     Themore American ships cruising along the South Americancoast the better, as you, Sir, would no doubt hear

what they saw or did not see.     Raider might then findAmerican waters rather crowded, or may anyhow prefer to go on to South African trade-route, where we are preparing.We wish to help you in every way in keeping the war out of American waters.

Memorandum.While the proposal in general is welcomed,the following points will need attention.1.     From the point of view of International Law,it would obviously be necessary to make itclear that British assent to the proposal was not any precedent and did not imply a recognition of a right on the part of a neutral to exclude belligerents fromoperating anywhere on the high seas (i.e.outside the three-mile limit).2.     It would naturally be necessary forbelligerent forces to have free access totheir own or Allied territory and territorial waters within the zone.3.     It would be a fundamental part of the scheme that it should be effective, i. e. not only that enemy action against territory, forces or shipping should be prevented, but alsothat the use of the area as a sanctuary inwhich raiders or supply ships might takerefuge should be prevented.     The questionof the use of the area as a sanctuary isclearly very important because, unless such action were prevented, it would clearlyfacilitate greatly the operations of enemyraiders in areas outside the zone.4.     The extent of the zone to be finally adoptedwould presumably be linked up with thepossibilities of effective enforcement,5.     The conversion of belligerent merchant shipsinto warships in ports within the zonewould presumably be prevented.6.     It would naturally be necessary that abelligerent should retain the right tocontinue a pursuit of the forces of hisenemy into this area, because otherwise the existence of the zone might frequentlyenable a raider to escape destruction andsubsequently emerge from the zone torecommence raiding in some other area.7.     We should of course hope to obtain any information concerning the movements of enemy forces within the area since theoperation of the scheme would greatlyreduce the possibilities of obtaining such information for ourselves. / 8.

8.     The question of enemy merchant ships is also of some importance because the number nowinterned in various American ports mightpresumably, under the safety given by thescheme, resume trading on the american continent, so earning considerable quantitiesof foreign currency.     Such trading would presumably in any case not be allowedunless the Germans themselves had accentedthe scheme and respected it.
