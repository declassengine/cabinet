W.M.(59) 49th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 3.Confidential Annex.* 9 *NAVAL SITUATION. THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that theGermans still did not appear to have any informationas to how the ROYAL OAK had been sunk;   he thereforedid not propose to publish any further information on the matter for the time being.   He thought, however that it was only a question of time before the newsbecame known, and he therefore proposed to make anannouncement on the matter in the House of commons on the following day.   Every effort was being made to destroy the German submarine which was presumed to bein Scapa Flow;    but even after success had attendedthese efforts, the Admiralty would not feel justifiedin allowing the Fleet to use Scapa untiij. the anti-submarine defences had been strengthened.   This wouldbe effected by the 7th November, and it had beendecided that the Fleet should use Rosyth,in the meanwhile, as a Fleet base.   The Forth was reasonably well defended, but the Air Ministry had been askedwhether they  could reinforce the air defences,particularly by the stationing of additional fighter squadrons.THE PRIME MINISTER asked what steps had been takento prevent another enemy submarine getting into ScapaFlow.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that theAdmiralty were satisfied that the enemy submarine had got into Scapa Flow on an occasion when the gate hadbeen left open for a considerable time, owing tocertain ships which were due to enter the harbour

having been three-quarters of an hour late.   Therehad, in fact, been over-confidence in the immunityof the Plow to submarine attack.   The Plow would bemade thoroughly safe by the 7th November.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE saidthat in the last War there had been a double net round the Flow.   He asked whether the Admiralty were satisfiedthat the size of the mesh was such that no submarinecould get through it.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that he felt no doubt thatthe submarine had gone through the entrance.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether there was any possibility of retaliating for the loss of the ROYAL OAK)by a submarine attack on German warships in harbour.THE FIRST&quot;SEA LORD pointed out that this wasconsidered impracticable owing to the narrow, shallow&apos;water approaches to the German naval bases.I...-Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,16th October, 1939.

W.M.(39) 49th. CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1%Confidential. Annex.*     *      *THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to telegram No. 147, dated 11th October,19-39, from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, The Hague,regarding the activities of Dahlerus, the text ofwhich he had read to the War Cabinet at the Meetingnoted in the margin.    Since that Meeting he had sent a telegram to Sir Nevile Bland on the lines agreedupon by the War Cabinet, and had added that Dahlerusshould not proceed to this country unless and until we had received proposals in writing from the GermanGovernment and had had an opportunity of judgingtheir value.   He had arranged to see M. Cor bin, theFrench Ambassador, that afternoon, and he intendedto show him both the telegram received from Sir Nevil^jBland and also the reply which he had sent.   there might conceivably be some connection between DahlerusMiInegotiations and the fact that, after two days ofiviolent abuse, the German Press now showed an incliha-tion to resume the peace offensive.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that he felt some apprehension as to the reliability of Dahlerusas a channel of communication.    If there were anyleakage of information the results might be serious.THE PRIMS MINISTER said that he could see noobjection to the procedure which had been followed,since we had done no more than repeat the essence of the statement which, he had made in the House ofCommons the previous week.   As regardslthe possibilityof a lea-kage of information, this was most unlikely to come from the German side, since it would be most

damaging to them if it became known that, instead of proceeding with their offensive in the West, theywere putting out secret peace feelers to us.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he realised the need for great caution indealing with a man like Dahlerus.    On the otherhand, he thought that it was of advantage for usto tell the German Government^ through a channel inwhich they had confidence, that in fact our attitude was precisely as stated by the Prime Minister inthe House of Commons.richmond Terrace, S.W.1,16th October, 1959.
