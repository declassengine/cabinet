6AiMOST SECRET.CONFIDENTIAL AHMBX TO W.M.(S9) MINUTE 5.a staff CONVERSATTOMS WITH BELGIUM.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat M. Van Zeeland had expressed a high opinion ofthe Belgian defences, of their demolitions and oftheir fighter aircraft.atrTHE CHIEF OF THE XM^SRXXKXSSMKRAK STAFF saidthat the military authorities in this country did notrate the quality of the Belgian defences at all highly.There must also be grave doubt whether the proposeddemolitions would in fact he made.THE CHIEF&apos; OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF pointedout that our Army in France was under the command ofthe French Commander-in-Chief.   There was a risk thatif a German attack was made through Belgium, theBritish Commander would receive orders from the french commander-in-chief to advance from his prepared lines to help the Belgian Army.   Faced with the risk of asecond Mons, the British Commander-in-Chief would feelhound to protest against any such order.   This protest,which would have to he submitted to the British WarCabinet, would inevitably cause delay, at a time whenevery hour might be of vital importance.   He thoughtit was right to draw the attention of the War Cabinetto the possibility of this dangerous situation arising.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR pointed out thatthis matter had been dealt with in discussions whichhad taken place between the Minister without Portfolio,himself, M. Daladier and General Gamelin.    They had stated that they would not on any account agree toany advance to the Belgian-German frontier.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY pointed out thatthere was a considerable length of line between ourLeft and the sea which would be occupied by the French,and that if there was a question of an advance into belgium the French on our Left would be at least asmuch exposed as we were.    It was clear from the conversations which had taken place that, if Belgium,was invaded, the French thought that it would be practicable to advance to the line of the Scheldt.He thought that this was a point, whichstould be studied in detail Hia&amp;&amp; now, while there was yet time.THE PR ME MINISTER took the view that the point at issue was a military one which should be discussed and. agreed beforehand between the British and FrenchCommanders.   Our representatives would, no doubt,make it clear that if there was a risk of our being asked to leave our prepared defences and advance tosome position which we might never be able to occupy,we should protest.Ri richmond T terrace ce, S.W.1,27th September, 19.39.

MOST SECRET.CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX TO W.M.(59)  29. MINUTE 6..BRITISH STRENGTH IN FIGHTERS ANDA.A. CHJNS IN. FRANCE..THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF explained thatGenera.1 Gamelin had asked for an increase of some 6Fighter Squadrons over and above the 4 Field Force squadrons already in France.   The present arrangement was that we had. 4 Fighter Squadrons in France.   Atthe moment they were in the Le-Havre-Rouen area.All four Squadrons were due to move up to the forward area North of the Somme.    In the event, however, 6fthere being no attack through Belgium, it had. beenarranged that two of these Squadrons should move tothe Verdun area.The first French request was that they wanted usto leave 4 Squadrons in the Le Havre-Rouen area andto send another lg Squadrons from 1b&amp;&quot;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;l&amp; to thearea North of the Somme.    Our answer was that we could,not agree that lg Squadrons would be sufficient forthe protection of the Forward. Area and to cover theco-operation aircraft of the B.E.F.    In^he view ofthe Chiefs of Staff, 4 Squadrons necessary forthis purpose.    It was recognised that when these fourSquadrons had moved to the Forward. Area,  the onlydirect cover for the Le Havre-Rouen area would beprovided by the French Fighter Squadrons;   but theChiefs of Staff felt that valuable distant  cover would,be afforded, by the British Squadrons North of the somme.The French also wanted 4 additional Sqtaadr-ono-forthe defence of the -Advanced Air Striking Force

(Rheims area).   On this our proposed answer was asfollows:- .(a) Arrangements were being made to enableS-fryp-rG .Bjr-gq4Mu3rcrns to be operatedeither from the Rheims or from the Sommearea in the event of a heavy air attackon.France, subject.to conditions in the,united Kingaoor making it possible to releasethes e Squadrons :(b) As already explained, two Squadrons mightbe. moved from Kfets Worth of the Somme to Vercif the German thrust through Belgium didnot develop:    This would go some way towardsproviding the additional protection for theRheims area.In regard to A.A.guns, we already had 72 guns in France.   The French requests were as follows:-First, they wanted 24 additional guns atNantes.   This had been agreed to.Secondly, they asked for the relief of 24 guns in the Lille-Lens area.    G.H.Q,. of the british expeditionary Force had been asked whether their ownA.A. arrangements would justify them in allowingthese guns to be removed        A*\h w^U U ^vc^ JU*ud- kThirdly, they s,sked. us to provide 36 guns in theRheims area for the protection of the Advanced air striking Force.   This could not be agreed to, except at the expense of our Home Defences .    The French, as recently as August, had undertaken to be responsiblefor the defence of the Advanced Air Striking Force,and it was recommended that they, should be held totheir undertaking.Further, it was pointed, out that under arrange-ments in contemplation the number of our A.A. guns inFrance would by December be double the existingnumb er (72 guns).Richmond Terrace, S .W. 1,27th September, 1939.
