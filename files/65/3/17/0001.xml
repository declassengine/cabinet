Confidential Annex.R.A.F. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked whether the casulties.casualties which the R.A.F. were at present sufferingcould he accepted as normal.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that itwas perhaps premature to he disturbed by the casualtieswhich had been inflicted so far.      The loss of four aircraft in an engagement between 5 Battles and 15Messerschmidts the previous day was not discouraging,taking into account the relative performances of theaircraft, and the fact that the Battles were withoutFighter escort.      It must,moreover, be rememberedthat this was only one of many reconnaissances,  themajority of which had been carried out withoutcasualties.      We should regard these early encountersas useful experiences from which we could learnvaluable lessons.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY askedwhether these reconnaissances might not be carriedout better by aircraft of a more modern type than theobsolescent Battle, and suggested that the lattermight be reserved for large-scale bombing operation,,in which they would be more likely to enjoy safetyin numbers.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR repliedthat there were two alternatives - either to continueto use Battles but to reinforce them with Fighterescorts, or to replace the Battles with high-performance aircraft, which would have to be drawn

from this country.     As regards the latter, we must bear in mind that more important calls on thesebetter aircraft might be made later.In reply to this question, THE CHIEF OFTHE AIR STAFF explained that the orders for thesereconnaissances were given by the British Air ForceCommander in accordance with the general requirementsof the French Commander-in-Chief.

Confidential Annex.NAVALDISPOSITIONSTO DEAL with german POCKETBATTLESHIP&quot;ADMIRAL SCHEER&quot;IN THE ATLANTIC.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that four hunting units were being formed to seek out and destroy the  1ADMIRAL SCHEER&apos;  (26 to 27 knots;carrying six 11-inch guns) which had been reportedoff Pernambuco.      One unit consisted of the  &quot;RENOWN&apos;and &apos;ARK ROYAL&apos; and the other three of two 8-inch cruisers each.      There was a risk in employing two8-inch cruisers to attack the  &apos;ADMIRAL SCHEER&apos;, butthe risk was one which must be accepted.     Inaddition, it was proposed to ask the French to send a battle-cruiser to operate from Dakar.      It was anticipated that the groups would be in operation in nine or ten days&apos;  time.     In the meanwhile, the&quot;ADMIRAL SCHEER&apos; might operate either in the carribbean Sea or in the Eastern Atlantic on the cape Route.     The latter alternative might beconfeMSEwd with some menacing move by Italy.      Untilthe  *ADMIRAL SCHEER* had been hunted down, ourmerchant ships in the South Atlantic would be keptas widely dispersed as possible by evasive routeing.

VISIT OFH.M.  THE king to THEHOME FLEET.Confidential Annex.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY saidthat the Coramander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, proposedthat His Majesty should embark in the cruiser&quot;SHEFFIELD1,  at Invergordon.      H.M.S.   1 SHEFFIELD&apos;would leave at 1400 hours on the day in question,and would be escorted to Scapa by four destroyers.His Majesty would spend the whole of the next day with the Fleet and then return in H.M.S.   &quot;SHEFFIELD1,not necessarily by the same route.

W.M.(59),  54th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 15.Confidential Annex.GERMANY. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSInternal said that he thought that the War Cabinet would beSituation.interested to receive certain information which he hoped would be treated as highly confidential, whichhad been derived by H.M. Ambassador, Ankara, from the netherland Minister, Ankara, in conversation with herr von Papen, the German Ambassador in Ankara.      Inthe course of the previous week, Sir Orme Sargent ofthe Foreign Office, had received two letters fromSir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, regarding communications which he had received from the Netherland Minister.The general drift of the information reported was thatthe Netherland Minister had been sounded by Herr vonPapen - obviously with the intention that he (the netherland Minister) should pass on his remarks to us -on the subject of our attitude towards peace.      Herr vonPapen had shown himself extremely insistent in thismatter.      The Foreign Office had informed Sir HugheKnatchbull-Hugessen that Herr von Papen was mostunreliable but he had been authorised to gather what information he could from that source.The previous evening (the 1st October, 1959),Sir Orme Sargent received a Telegram from our Ambassador,stating that the Netherland Minister had dined at theGerman Embassy the previous evening, and had foundHerr von Papen extremely bitter against the present regime in Germany.     The situation in his(von Papon&apos;s) opinion was extremely dangerous, and he.

70i oentertained the utmost distrust of Dr. Goebbels.      Hehad referred to the possibility of a peace offer beingmade by Herr Hitler at an early date.      To this, the netherland Minister had replied that there was not the slightest chance of such an offer being entertained by great Britain until Herr Hitler and Hitlerism had been disposed of.      Herr von Papen had replied that this statement was &quot;short, clear and significant&quot;.      he added that he proposed to do everything possible to expedite his own return to Berlin.      The NetherlandMinister had informed Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen,that he fully anticipated that Herr von Papen&apos;s object in returning to Germany was to secure the immediateelimination of herr Hitler and that he anticipated that herr von Papen would attempt to form some ProvisionalGovernment under Marshal Goering, with a view to theultimate restoration of the monarchy.      It would, inhis opinion, be a great mistake for us to refuse tohave any dealings with a Government of this kind, sinceto do so would be to play into the hands of Dr. Goebbels.The Secretary of State added, that Mr.Kirkpatrick of the Foreign Office, who knew Herr vonPapen regarded him as a light-weight but, on the otherhand, as an extremely clever intriguer.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he regardedHerr von Papen as most hysterical and unreliable.      Hehad seen a great deal of him during the lausanne conference.

Peace Offer. At a later stage, THE FOREIGN SECRETARYread out a further communicatiori from the same sourceat Ankara, giving an outline of the peace terms whichit was suggested that Germany would offer.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statement.K-ei0^ tfr*l

Decypher.    Sir H. Knatchbull-Hugessen (Angora)October 1st, 1939.D.    8.46 p.m.      October 1st,  1939.R.    5.00 a.m.      October 2nd, 1939.No.  541.IMMEDIATE.My telegram No.  558.Following for Sir 0.  Sargent.Secret.Informant has since received telegram from hisGovernment instructing him to continue as hitherto and adding that everything he has so far reported in regardto action and statements of German Ambassador has been confirmed from other sources.2.      His Government have at the same time informed him of outline of peace proposals which are shortly to beput forward.    He states that these are identical withprogramme given him by German Ambassador (see my secretletter of September 22nd) and that they in fact originatefrom Herr von Papen.3.      Outline is as follows:(a) Poland as occupied by Germany up to lineagreed with Moscow to be reconstituted as on independent state, Danzig remaining German. My informant suggeststhat it might be possible to push Germany into further concessions involving portion in Russian occupation if germany&apos;s face could be saved in the matter of colonies.(b) Settlement as regards colonies - see (a).(c) Abdication of Herr Hitler.(d) Re-arrangement of frontiers in eastern europe by international conference.    Question of presentSlovak state would figure prominently.(e) European disarmament.

My. informant understands from German ambassador that emphasis is on &quot;European&quot; as it is recognised thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government must have armed forces tosafeguard their overseas possessions.(f) Autonomy of Czechoslovakia,  i.e.  that whichis now under Germany.(g) There was a further point concerning Italywhich was undecypherable in my informant&apos;s telegram.    I maybe able to telegraph later.(h) There are also subsidiary points, the chiefof which-would appear to be an economic conference tosettle questions concerning currencies, gold standard, etc.4.      My informant regards this telegram from hisGovernment as proof that German Ambassador has influence and is not merely playing his own game.    He states that herr von Papen&apos;s idea is a restoration under aHohenzollern Prince, though Herr von Papen personallywould prefer a Bavarian as being Catholic.    He also statedthat the above proposals had Herr Hitler&apos;s consent.5.      As regards attitude of his own Government he hadlearnt that they would only be prepared to take any actionin the way of mediation if officially asked to do so by german Government.    I observed that in such cases it wasusual to make it a condition that mediation was acceptable to both sides and not to one only.i.6.      I feel that I can only pass this on to you for what it is worth.    My informant fully understands that Ihave merely received it (grp. undec.) as information with no comment on my side whatever beyond re-statement of our original war aims.
