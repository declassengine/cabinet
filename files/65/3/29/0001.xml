Confidential Annex..SECURITY OPFLEET BASESH.M.S. ROYAL OAK. THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat although there had been a German broadcast by aU-boat Captain purporting to describe his attack onH.M.S. ROYAL OAK, he (the Minister) was by no meanssatisfied that the submarine had succeeded in getting into scapa Plow and out.&quot; again.    Even if the submarine had got in through the gate in the net, it seemed most unlikely that the submarine would have succeeded inescaping in the same way.   He drew attention to certaindiscrepancies in the U-boat Captain&apos;s report which ledhim to think that the U-boat Captain had not been present at the point from which the torpedo had been fired.   Hethought that the Germans might have succeeded in getting a raft or small boat over or between the sunken shipsblocking one of the subsidiary entrances to Scapa.    Sucha raft might have carried very heavy torpedoes .   The crew of the raft might have succeeded in making their escapeafter discharging these torpedoes^&amp;U      *     ******In the subsequent discussion it was recalled that two men in the gate ship had distinctly hea-rd the soundof propellers previous to the attack.   This tended to confirm that the attack had been made by a submarine.Moreover, the only entrances which could have been used.,by a raft or some similar c3?aft were on the East side,where, at the time in question, there ha.d been hea-vyseas running, which would probably rule out such an operation.    On the other hand, it was recalled that an italian motor torpedo boa.t, at the end of the last war,had succeeded, in penetrating the harbour defences ofPola .

Another suggestion was that two submarines had been working in collaboration, and that one only had entered the harbour. Her crew, after carrying out the attack, might have scuttled their submarine and been picked up by the other submarine lying outside.

In the course of discussion THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that the previous night all the german U-boats had spoken to Germany by wireless. This might have been in answer to some message. What had that message been? Had it been an enquiry as to which submarine had sunk the ROYAL OAK, or was it a direction to make some concentrated move against the Fleet?

The First Lord added that Admiral Drax was at present at Scapa investigating into the position, and it was agreed that the suggestions made by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should be communicated to admiral Drax.

Considerable discussion took place as to the present unsatisfactory position of the defences of Scapa.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that in his view great caution should be exercised as to the location of the big ships of the Fleet during the next few weeks. He thought that Scapa was at present quite unfit as a base for the Fleet, owing to the lack of guns and under-water defences. There was only one line of nets, as compared with three in the last War. The Naval staff were inclining more and more to using Rosyth as a Fleet base until Scapa could be made ready. This, however,

would involve considerable strengthening of trie Rosythdefences.   Eight movable guns had been sent there theprevious day.   The Naval Staff thought that a 72-gunconcentration should be provided.   It was also hopedthat the Royal Air Force would be able to provide additional support.In the course of discussion THE CHIEF OF THE AIRSTAFF pointed out the advantages, from the point of viewof air attack, of a Fleet Base on the West Coast;   butTHE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that it was essential!to have a. base on the East Coast.The War Cabinet agreed  That a Committee, composed as under,should examine, as a matter of urgency,the arrangements to be made to providea secure base for the Fleet on the east coast: -The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,The three Service Ministers,The Minister without Portfolio,The three Chiefs of Staff.Ri richmond Terra ce, S.W.1,18th October, 1939.

Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,18th October, 1939 .W.M.(59)  51st CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 10.Confidential Annex.*     *     *ITALY. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had on the previous day seen both Signor Bastian-ini, the new Italian Ambassador, and also Lady Loraine,who had travelled with the Ambassador from Rome.   In thecourse of conversation in the train, Lady Loraine had asked Signor Bastianini what happened to Italian diplo-mats in the event of war:   were they called up formilitary service in accordance with their age groups,as in many countries?   To this Signor Bastianini had replied, apparently without thinking, &quot;Yes, they are called up according to age, but in the present ease if italy were involved in war I doubt if they would recallme.    If they did, they would probably send Imperialehere&quot;.   The obvious inference was that if Italy became involved in war it would not be against us.The War Cabinet took note of theab ov e s tat erne nt.
