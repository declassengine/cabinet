CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX TO W.M.   (59) 16th CONCLUSIONS,MINUTE 7.THE MILITARYSITUATION INFRANCE.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat he had gained a definite impression that general gamelin was weakening in his resolve to stage a strongattack on the Siegfried Line.     He had derived hislatest impression from a discussion which GeneralHotblack had had with General Gamelin.     The reasonwas that the French thought that the Germans meant tomake some sort of riposte.    General Gamelin was anxiousto defend himself in the Maginot Line and not to have more troops in front of that Line than he could quicklywithdraw.The French also thought that there was apossibility that Germany could stage a big attack onthe Western Front on the 15th October.    ,He (The Chiefof the Imperial General Staff) thought   that such anattack would not be possible until the end of October.But General Gamelin&apos;s view was that such an attack couldbe made by the 15th October.     He had been imbued withthe idea of a strong attack by the German Army and AirForce sweeping through the Low Countries.There were two or three points in this which affected us.      The first was that the whole of our four divisions would then be in France, but they would not bereally fully equipped for war up to 1914 standards.The second point was that we were dependent onseaborne supplies, and if we were caught in a cornerwe should be in a far more dangerous position than thecorresponding French Divisions.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought thatit would be a good thing if Germany were to attempt tostage a strong attack in the West.

After some further discussion, the WarCabinet agreed:That the Chiefs of Staff should consider and report on the role to be assigned to the British Field Force in the eventof a German attack through the low countries.i0
