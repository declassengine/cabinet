TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND  KEY.; &apos;---:---- -fOIIt is requested that special care may be taken to 1 fj Oensure the secrecy of this document.- MOST SECRET -W.M-(S9)  47th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.AIR POLICY, THE MINISTER FOR CO-DRDTNA^ION OP DEFENCE saidthat the Conference arranged in accordance with the(previous reference:       War Cabinet Conclusion referred to in the margin.W.M.(39) 46thConclusions,    had arrived at the following, conclusions in connec-minute e 2,)tion with the policy which should govern the employ-ment of the Royal Air Force in the immediate future.The governing fa.ctors might be summarised a.sfollows :-(a) The Allies were in a position ofinferiority vis-a-vis Germany in existing air strengths.   From this it follower! that for the present theinitiative wa.s with Germany:    our action must be conditioned by heraction.    It also followed that, sofar as enemy action permitted, weshould conserve a.nd develop our resources until the gap in numericalstrength was narrowed.    In particular,we should not fritter away our striking force on unprofitable objectives in deference to public clamour for&apos;retaliation or public criticism atinaction.(b) On the other hand, we must not shrinkfrom using the whole of our air strengthif enemy action against either Pranceor ourselves looked like being decisive;for example, an attack on our MercantileMarine, on the scale of 1917:    in that event, our striking force must, at all costs, be employed in the manner thatheld out the best hope of obtainingdecisive results a.gainst Germany,fc) Germany&apos;s weakest spot was the Ruhr,the heart of which wa.s about the size of Greater London, anr1 in which was concentrated approximately 60 per cent,of Germany&apos;s vital industry.    It con-tained. moreover, a. population whichmight be expected to crack underextensive air attack.    Such attackswould involve a. heavy casualty rollamong civilians, including women andchildren.

(d) We should not be the first to &quot;takethe gloves off&quot;.   Prom this it followed that until and unless Germany, either by killing large numbers of civiliansor by a violation of Belgium, gave thenecessary justification, there couldbe no question of attacking the Ruhr,or anything other than strictly militaryob j ectivesIf the War Cabinet approved these conclusions,the Committee proposed that the governing principles should be applied to the situation with which we were now confronted, in the following way:-(i) If the enemy confined his attack either on the French or ouselves to strictly military objectives, we should reply bystrictly limited attacks on correspondingGerman objectives, i.e., we should continueour present bombardment policy.(ii) If the enemy atta.cked convoys or evenour Fast (joast ports indecisively, i,e,,if they were not doing vital damage  we should, still not do anything to inviteretaliation which might do us vital damage.It would, however&apos;, probably be necessary,both on military and political grounds,to take some &quot;token&quot; action in reply.For example, an attack on Hamburg oil storage and. Refinery would, be a useful,specta.cula.r and appropriate reply to aGerman attack on &quot;East Coast ports orLondon Docks.fill)  If the Germans should deliver an attackon either France or ourselves whichlooked, like being decisive and hadinvolved either appreciable casualties to civilians outside the battle zone(i.e., anywhere in England or in the backareas in France) or a violation of Belgianneutrality, we should attack the Ruhr as our first and chief objective.    In theevent of an attack on France throughBelgium, our air forces,  in addition toattacking the Ruhr, should operate against any favourable military targets presented by the German advance.Action under (i) was within the existing policy approved by the War Cabinet.   Action under (ii).andparticularly (iii), would not have to be taken at a mount&apos;s notice, and, in the view of the Committee,should not be undertaken without the approval of theWar Cabinet

THE PRIME MINISTER observed that an attack on&apos;the Ruhr, in consequence of Germany violating Belgianneutrality, would be a departure from our previousideas .THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE saidthat the Committee had taken the view that an attackon Belgium would be an a.ct which would involvetremendous suffering in Belgium amongst the civilpopulation, and we should be amply justified inhitting Germany as hard, as we could.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether the sameargument did not apply to Luxembourg and Holland.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR ATR said, that Belgiumhad been considered a special ca.se.    An advancethrough Luxembourg would meet with no opposition, a.sthere were no defences.   An advance into Hollandwould no dou^t be rapidly succeeded by an attack onBelgium.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,while not pre-judging the issue, a,sked. whether therewas not a. wide distinction between a violation of belgian neutrality and an attack on the Ruhr, whichwould result in heavy  civilian casualties.    In thelatter ca.se would, there not be a grave danger of anaccusation that we were the first to &quot;take thegloves off&quot;?THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that hethought the violation of Belgium would a-f-ford a moraljustification for our bombing the Ruhr,  even if this involved civilian casualties.    The idea of causingcivilian casualties among the German population ofthe Ruhr was to him less shocking than the civilian casualties which the Belgians would incur if webombed, the German Army while it was moving throughBelgium.

J. ki 0THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR ATR pointed out that,in order to invade Belgium, the German Army would have-to pass through the Ruhr, which would therefore become a military concentration area..THE LORD PRIVY SEAL felt that a decision on thematter should not be taken until the time came.   Anindis criminate attack on the Ruhr, in reply to a violation of Belgian neutrality, would be a departure from the policy (which we were at present pursuing)of meeting like with like.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR ATR pointed out thatan attack by our Air Force on the Ruhr would, be by no means indiscriminate,    Atta.cks would be carriedout in daylight against military objectives.    It was inevitable, however, that, heavy civilian casualtieswoul^ be caused.   A point which the ;.Var cabinet would have to bear in mind, was the probable losssustained by our atta.cking formations, which might conceivably be as heavy a.s 50 per cent.THE MINISTER WPTTOPT PORTFOLIO said that theCommittee had. felt that attack on the Ruhr was theonly operation of a. decisive character to relieve the pressure on Belgium.there was general agreement, that an attack onthe Ruhr would, have a very big moral, as well as military,  effect.In the course of discussion it was pointed outthat the Belgian Ambassador had. been confident thatthe Belgian defences would, hold up a German advanceat least -for a. time.THE CHIEF OF mHE AIR STAFF said that, in the .view of the Chiefs of Sta.ff, Belgium could, only impose a certain,in delay on the German a.dva.nce.

Tt was agreed that, while it was desirable tohave preliminary discussion on this matter, therewa.s no need for the War Cabinet to reach a finaldecision that day as to the use of our Bomber Forcein the circumstances envisaged.The War Cabinet  (i) Approved the conclusions summa.risedin (a), (b),  ( c)  and (d)  above:(ii) Took note of the proposed courses of action set out in ( i) , (ii)  and( iii)  above.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,14th October,  1939.

19 9JL    QW.M.(59) 47th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.*      e      *STAFF CONTACTS THE PRIME MINISTER reminded his colleagues thatWITH BELGIUM.he had arranged to see the Belgian Ambassador theprevious afternoon.    The Ambassador, however, had told him nothing which had not been contained inhis letter, and it therefore seemed that there wasno particular significance in the phrase that if he(the Prime Minister) wished for any further informa-tion, the Ambassador was willing to give it to him.The Ambassador ha.d emphasised the point that M.Stein iIwas only an economist, on which he had. many interest-1ing things to say.   He (the Prime Minister) hadrather gathered that even in this sphere M. Steinshould not be rated, too highly.Baron de Cartier had said that Belgium could,not compromise her attitude of strict neutrality.The position today wa.s very different from that of1914.    The Germans would not be able to over-runBelgium as they had then.    While it could not besaid that the Belgians  could hold up the Germansindefinitely, the Ambassador ha.d given the impression]that they should certainly be able, to impose a veryconsiderable delay upon the German advance, duringwhich time the Allied forces would be able to move forward into pre-arranged, positions to support theBelgian Army.    The Belgian defence scheme was an openbook for all to see, and they were making nor.secretof their efforts to put their house in order.The Prime Minister said that he had taken theopportunity of informing Baron de Cartier that,

if the Germans violated. Belgian neutrality, we should.endeavour to hold up their advance by air actionagainst the advancing German columns.   Howeverdiscriminate our pilots were, this action wouldprobably involve casualties to Belgian civiliansand refugees .   Baron de Cartier said that this situation was quite understood, and he made no demurat the statement which the Prime Minister made onthis point.The War Cabinet took note of theinformation communicated in thediscussion referred to above.Richmond Terra.ee, S.W.1,14th October, 1959.
