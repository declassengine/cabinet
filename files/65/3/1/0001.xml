Themain points an this report were the following s.-General Gamelin was in good spirit but he wasbeing pressed by his Government to move quickly to relieve thsGerman pressure on Poland.   He was resisting this pressure.The French Air Force, which was barely equipped, hadno air plan other than limited operations in cooperationwith the general plan of the French Army.French mobilisatiogji was now practically completedjand the concentration of the Army was now in progress andwas being accelerated.The danger period of mobilisation when tropps were particularly vulnerable to air attack had been safelypassed.&apos;&apos; JThe next phase consisted of a methodical, slow, andordered move forward up to the Maginot Line.Ultimately General Gamelin intended to throw outthree reconnaisajJLces in force and to test the..: strength of theSiefried Line.   He had no intention ofrrushing the operations and risking the loss of the flower of the French Army byprecipitate action.   The slow advance would be closelysupported by a very heavy concentration of artillery.  -It was anticipated that this phase would becompleted by &quot;XM day (the precise date was reported to the.War Cabinet in the discussion but it was agreed that eteenin this special record it should not be indicated).   general gamelin would by that date be ready to start &quot;leaning against&quot;the Siefried Line.It was not contemplated that the British field force would be ready to take part in the initial stages of

There was a noticeable and surprisingabsence of reconnaisance. &apos;:The pave by the French Army would be supported bycooperation by our Advanced Air Striking Force (10 squdrons).As far as our main Air Striking Force was concerned, it was important to observe the principle that we should notfritter it away on unremunerative tasks or risk leavingourselves so weak in bombers that we should not be ableto take effective air action to defend ourselves at a later stage.It was agreed that attacks on German oil supplies should not be initiated for the present, owing to thedanger of retaliation on our own vulnerable oil stocks,particularly those in the Thames.General Gamelin had no illusions as to the chanceof Polish resistance being prolonged; this was ruled out.This was an added reason for conserving our forces for themain struggle and not being led awa  by popular outcry.If, happily, a break through ofi the Siefried Linecould be achieved, then we should throw everything in to exploit the success including a strong force of bombers.I  conclusion, tHB CHIlf 0f $HS All B4A$ff and THECHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF expressed themselves as well satisfied with the results of their visit toGeneral Gamelin.General Gamelin, in turn, was satisfied with theaction which we contemplated taking in cooperation with the^rench.

THE MINISTER FOR THE COORDINATION OF DEFENCEinquired whether he was correct in concluding from thestatement, just made that what was anticipated was that atsome later srtage of the war there would he a large scaleby which he understoodair conflictsXj&amp;KitiKfe a conflict in which the air forces ofthe two sides would be engaged against one another in largenumbers.   Further, was he correct in concluding that the at presentpresent plan was not/to employ our Air Force for offensive operations   but to husband our forces for use inretaliatory action ,i.e. in counter-action.THE DHIEF OB THE AIR STAFF replied that it was theintention to retain the Air Force intact at the presenttime5 but it there was no question of the object of thispolicy being meely to hold the Air Force available forretaliation.   In the opinion of the Air Staff the best way in which to employ our bombers was to retain them until such time as a project presented itself which offerred a prospect of producing results which would have a decisiveeffect on the outcome of the war.   Examples of projects which might fall under this heading were afforded by:-(i)   the Oil Plan;(ii)   the Ruhr Plan; and(iii)   the Aircraft Industry Plan,THE MINISTER FOR THE COORDINATION OF DEFENCE askedwhether the objection to bombing oil installations at thepresent time was based on the mztg Rule.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF replied that the abovewas only one of a number of considerations on which thepresent view was based.   Personally, he was by no meansconvinced that the attack on the ATHENIA was part of a deliberate policy laid down by the German Government.RECORD OF THE SECOND PART OF THE DISCUSSION

INTERNATIONAL BOARD FOR NON-INTERVENTION IN SPAINANY   REPLY SHOULDBE   ADDRESSED TOTHE secretary at   THE  ABOVE   ADDRESSAND THE FOLLOWINGNUMBER QUOTED i-THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY pointed emt that the attack on the ATHEISTIA was not an isolated incident.   There wasdefinite evidence that four ships had &quot;been attacked.   The most recent of which he had information was the sinking of a Britishtramp ship in the Bay of Bisquay.   This vessel had been sunk by gunfire.THE MINISTER FOR THE COORDUATXON OF Di^EttCE said thatin his opinion the known distribution of German submarines around the British coast and in other parts of the world could only be explained on the basis that the sinking of ships was part of the deliberate policy of the German Government.THE SECRETARY OF S$ft$I  fel ftgl said that it would be a mistake to suppose that it was contemplated that the situation would develop into one  HxscfexKfe the main feature of which wouldbe a large seal conflict betv/een two opposing air florces.   he considered that the prdper course would be to employ our AirForce at  toxjax a suitable moment in conjunction with otherforces.    It would be a serious mistake &amp;b in the meanwhile touse our bombers for subsidiary purposes.   Personally he welcomed the plan which had been laid before the War Cabinet by the twoChiefs of Staff as the result of their discussions with general gamelin, though he fully appreciated the political difficulties involved in the policy proposed.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether it would be possibleto arrange for the permanent Military rarffri aagyfiSe^yprtea^aie-a.plan showing the proposed role or the Royal Air Force.THE CHIEF OF THE AIE STAFF welcomed this suggestion.THE PRIME MINISTER then inquired whether it would bepossible to take action whifh would have the result of leadingTELEPHONE NO.

On that particular occasion the Air Force had been given a target of very special importance, and the operatioj had in consequence tobeen well worth while.   Personally he had anticipated that theGermans would before now have taken some retaliatory action.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF agreed.   He had fully expectedthat there would have been retaliation today on eitharPortsmouth or Chatham.THE PRIME MINISTER said that such retaliation would havebeen entirely consistent with Herr Hitler&apos;s declaration thatattacks on Germany would be met &quot;by equal arms and in the samefiorm&quot;&quot;.   He would be glad to know whether there was any evidence to show that the Germans had carried out any reconnaisances ig.regard to the disposition of our fleet.THE FIRST SEA LORD replied that there was some evidencethat the Germans had carried out a reconnaisance&apos; along the coast of Norway, but not so far as could be ascertained over Scapa.It must not however be taken as certain that no such xsxmixxixsaa^reconnaisance had been carried out.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that he wished to revert for a moment to the discussions just completed in Paris.   General Gamelin had been very definite in Six theview which he held.   The plan which he favoured would be of very great importance if it v/ere found practicable.    If theoperation proposed were a demonstration only, it would certainly![OVER.serve /I

While/carrying out thisreinforcement it should be possible to cut off any givenposition frm the rear by the use of the and Arm.   The Spanishwar had shown the value of this type of operation.    Troops inmovement were extremely vulnerable, and doubtless excellenttargets for air attack would present themselves after &quot;X&quot; day.It would be of the greatest advantage to isolate the SiefriedLine.    If the Germans were prevented from reinforcing that Lineit might be possible for us to break through.   On the otherhand it must be Tmmm^wssA understood that if General Gamelinwere not permitted to make an attemt to carry out his plan, itwould mean to all intents and purposes the end of the western front as a theatre of war.   General Gamelin had no thought in-his mind but this plan.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF referred to the experience gained in the Spanish war to which the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff had referred.   The experience of that war had shown that it was possiboe to neutralise front areas by air action.   He believed that in an operation such as that suggestedit would be possible to delay the reinforcement of the SiegfriedLine but he was doubtful whether it would be possible permanentl;to prevent such reinforcement by this means.-THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that he did notbelieve that the essential elements of war would be altered bythe air arm.   As for the Spanidh experience, it should beremembered that for many weeks the Republican Armies had formany weeks maintained themselves on the south bank of the Ebro,notwithstanding t3mt. the fact that the bridges across theriver were subject to continuous and powerful air attack.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR asked whether he was correct in understanding that the Prime Minister did not desireto /

fto urge the Air Force to take further action at present,$referring rather that we should reserve our forces for assisting the French on and after HX&quot; day.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this was his view, but thathe did not wish to exclude the possibility of employing theIAir Force in the meanwhile against some special target were to   present itself.    In this connection he had in mind especially the possibility of employing the Air Arm effectively againstwarships at sea.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that this was apossibility which was constantly kept in mind.THE WAR CABINET agreed:-(a)   to approve generally the plan pf action proposedof action proposed by General Gamelin as reported Iat the present meeting by the Chiefl of the SgirStaff and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff5 p(b) that in view of (a) above the Royal Air Force shouldbe held xhxxe&amp;eexe available to assist the French Iforces on and after &quot;X&quot; day, it being understoodhowever that this decision did not exclude the Ipossibility of the R.A.F. being employed in the Imeanwhile if some target of special importance mewere to present itself. I(c) that the Permanent Military Representatives at theSupreme War Council Headquarters should be askedto work out a plan showing the proposed role Iof the Royal Air Force. j(851) 05855/614220,000 2/37 JC&amp;SLtdGp644/231(REQIIVIORE)Code 5-31-0
