Richmond. Terrace, S .W.1,12th October, 193 9.W.M.(59) 45th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 6.Confidential Annex.*      *     *GERMANY. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had had a further telegram from His Majesty1 minister at The Hague reporting that Dahlerus had arrived that morning and communicated orally theproposals of the German Government.   He did not thinkit was necessary to trouble the War Cabinet with thedetails of these proposals, which were extremely vague.They provided, for example, for a meeting of repre-sentatives of England., France and. Germany, to draw upa basis of points for submission to the respective governments.    If&quot;the latter approved, an armisticewould take place, followed by a Conference of theGreat Powers.    Perhaps the most significant point inthe proposals was the last one, namely, that if HisMajesty&apos;s Government were not prepared to negotiate with, the present regime in Germany, the proposals fell to the ground.    The Foreign Secretary did not proposeto send any answer to this message.
