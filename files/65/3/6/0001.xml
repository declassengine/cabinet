CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX TO W.M.(59),15th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 4.OBSERVANCE THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY pointed out thatOF INTER-NATIONAL LAW.     our Army would not he ready to make an offensive untilAir Objectives, next spring.    This made it all the more desirable thatwe should make the fullest possible use of the offensivepower of our air force.   He therefore asked whether,without going beyond our present policy, it would not bepossible to find strictly military objectives   suchas synthetic petrol plants in Germany which were vital to her prosecution of the war, and which, at the sametime, were isolated from the civil population   and toattack these even if this were to draw German fire onours elves .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that before doing so it was essential that we should be clear thatthe effect would not be to precipitate the very situationwhich we wished to avoid.   We should be guided in thismatter by three main considerations:-(i) That the target was really worth a.ttacking:(ii) That it would not be too expensive to attack:(iii) Above all, that we must keep our small andinferior Air Force &quot;in being&quot; against thetime when its existence might be vital to us.It was to be remembered that we should be in animmeasurably better position by next March.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that the targetswe wanted might be found when the French offensive was launched.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO  considered that theNavs.l objectives which were covered by our bormmrdmentinstructions constituted targets of real military value.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE suggestedthat we would have to be prepared for greater losses in attempting a second attack on the German Fleet.

Meanwhile he suggested that if it was in Hitler&apos;mind, to make peace, the present might- he the besttime to launch a determined attack on German industry,on the grounds that Hitler would be less likely to retaliate now for fear of compromising his peace plans.THE PRIME MINISTER regarded this as a very dangerous argument, since Hitler would be able to claim that at the moment when he was about to makepeace we had taken action which made it impossiblefor him to make the offer.The result of the discussion was to confirm theWar Cabinet in adherence to the policy recommended bythe Chiefs of Staff in Paper W.P.(39) 19 and approvedby the War Cabinet at their 12th Meeting (W.M.(39) 12thCon cl-as ions , Minute^&quot;).
