3 AW.M.   (59)  22nd CONCLUSIONS:    MINUTE 6.Confidential Annex.ROUMANIAN THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFOIL SUPPLIES.explained certain steps which had been taken, or were contemplated, to prevent Roumanian oil supplies from falling into the hands of the Germans.      Contacthad been established some months previously with therepresentatives of British Oil Companies in theRoumanian oilfields, and plans had been worked out for the destruction of the wells and refineries inthe event of a German advance into Roumania.      these plans were mainly dependent on personnel in the employof the oil companies.      Lieut. Commander Watson,  oneof the representatives who had been sent out, had reported, however,  on his recent return to this country,that there was difficulty in obtaining a sufficientquantity of explosives.      He had also thought that theBritish personnel might have difficulty with Germanemployees in the oilfields, who would endeavour toprevent the proposed sabotage.     Arrangements had nowbeen made that a company of Royal Engineers, at presentstationed in Egypt,  should proceed to Roumania to reinforce the British employees,  taking with them as great a quantity of explosives as possible,      as soonas the risk of a German invasion became imminent.    Itwould take approximately six days for the party to reach the Oil Wells area after leaving Alexandria,It would obviously create difficulties if wewere to take any very obvious action, with a view tosabotaging the wells in a neutral country, before therewas any open threat of German invasion.

W.M.   (39),  22nd CONCLUSIONS, KINUTE 12.Confidential Annex.HI   THE BALKANS. THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY stigmatised asodious the conduct of the Roumanian Government in refusing to permit the members of the Polish Government to pass through Roumania as private individuals.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR FOREIGN affairs said that it was necessary to recognise that we werenot in a position to give effective help to Roumania if she were invaded by Germany, and it was not in our interests to force them to take action which would leadto the invasion of their country.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that theaction of the Roumanian Government in this matter,  taken as it was at the dictation of Germany, would, when it became known, create a deplorable impression in thiscountry,  in the United States and elsewhere.      In viewof the obligations which we had undertaken towardsRoumania, it was important that the Roumanian Governmentshould be made to understand the position.      Did they wish to face the menace of Germany single-handed&apos;?      Itwould in his (the First Lord&apos;s) opinion be extremelywrong to underrate the seriousness of the conduct ofthe Roumanian Government.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that thecentral point to which we should pay regard in thismatter was the fact that it would not pay us for Roumaniato be invaded by the Germans at the present time.THE PRIME MINISTER inquired what practicalvalue would result from the establishment in Paris of a) Polish Government.      If the object was merely to secure

o0that in this way there should remain in existencethe ghost of a great Power, then that object could surelyhe still secured through a Polish Government differentlyconstituted.      It was not necessary for this purpose thatthe Polish Ministers now in Roumania should reach Paris.He (the Prime Minister) would have taken a much more serious view of the Roumanian action if there had been any suggestion that the Polish Ministers should be handed overby Roumania to Germany.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY said that thePolish Government were possessed of a substantial goldreserve,  several naval units, and a large man power in france,  the United States and elsewhere, from whichDivisions could be raised for employment on theWestern Front.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that Count Raczynski had the previous evening-expressed the view that,  if necessary,  it would bepossible to organise the Polish resources referred to bythe First Lord of the Admiralty,  through a PolishGovernment in Paris,  even if the present Polish Governmentwere interned in Roumania.      The action of the roumanian government in this matter &quot;was profoundly shocking, butthe difficulty was to see what effective action wecould take.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that in .his opinion fresh pressure should be brought to bear onthe Roumanian Government, who should be asked to explainhow they reconciled their present action with the position which they occupied towards us in view of our havingguaranteed their country against invasion by Germany.

THE MINISTER FOR THE CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that the whole matter depended on whether we wishedto see the war extended to the Balkans.      If we did not,we should be careful to do nothing which would JeopardiseRoumanian neutrality.      If, on the other hand, we diddesire an expansion of the war,  then it would be in our interests to encourage Roumania to resist Germany&apos;demands, in such a way as to ensure that she found herselfinvolved in war on our side against Germany.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had not yet seen the text of the latest telegram sent to Sir Reginald Hoare in Bucharest, but he had givenInstruction the previous night that Sir Reginald shouldbe Instructed not to exert extreme pressure upon theRoumanian Government, but that he was, at the same time,to leave them in no possible doubt as to what we thought of their behaviour.      As regards the guarantee which wehad given to Roumania, It must be remembered that thiswas purely unilateral and that in consequence theRoumanian Government might not regard us as entitledthereby to bring such pressure to bear on them as mightrisk their country being invaded by Germany.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that forhis part, he would like to see all the Balkan countries and Turkey also brought into the war,  especially if this could be secured with Italy&apos;s acquiescence.      We neededas many Allies in the Balkans as we could secure and itwas not at till to our interest that the Balkans should bekept in a state of quiet, whilst France and ourselveswere left to bear the full brunt of the German assault on the Western Front.

r-&apos; nTHE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat if such a policy were adopted,  Germany might andprobably would be able to overrun one Balkan country after another.      It was not at all in our interest to uresentAGermany with such a series of additional cheap victories.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that ifYugoslavia and Turkey joined us in hostilities withGermany, Germany would not be in a position to secure easyvictories of this kind.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that In the viewof the Chiefs of Staffs Committee, it was not to our advantage at present that the war should be extended tothe Balkans.      In reaching this conclusion they had been largely influenced by the problem of Italy.TEE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF agreed,but added that the view of the Chiefs of Staffs Committeewas reinforced by our experience in the last war.      In thecase of Roumania in particular, she had been encouraged by France to come into the war prematurely with the resultthat she had been quickly overrun.      If we were to draw the Balkan countries into the present war on our side, itwas essential that we should make certain that they came inat the right moment.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that thediscussion showed that we appeared unwilling to encouragean extension of the war in the East while, at the sametime, we did not look forward to the forthcoming war inthe West.      This was a dilemma v/hich it would, benecessary to face.
