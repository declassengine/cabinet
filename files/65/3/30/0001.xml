SECURITY OPFLEET BASESDefence ofRosyth.(previous reference:W.M.(39)  51stConclusions,minute e 4 o)- MOST SECRET -W,M.(g9)  58nd CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEinformed the War Cabinet that the meeting which hadbeen held the previous day to discuss the improvementof the defences at Rosyth had been eminently satis-factory.    It had been arranged that the existinganti-aircraft defences should be more than doubled.These guns would be provided, in the main, by the diversion of units which were already on their way toScapa, and the allocation of a now..-unit from Woolwlohwhich..was originally&apos; intended for .tho dofo-n-cig of-begiaoja.   None, however, of the existing guns at Seapawould be withdrawn.   The number of close-range weapons  pompoms, etc.   at Rosyth for defence againstlow-flying attack was being increased, and likewisethe number of searchlights.   A balloon barrage wasbeing provided.    A satisfactory proposal had been madeby the Chief of the Air Staff for* the provision of fighters.    These arrangements would begin to come intoforce within the next two days, and would be completed in a fortnight.   He thought, taking all the circum-stances into account, that they would make of Rosythas secure a base as possible for the Fleet, pendingthe completion of the defences at Scapa.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF asked to be allowedto enter a caveat, regarding the statement by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence that these steps would make Rosyth &quot;as secure as possible&quot;.    No matterhow many fighters, guns and other defences we mightplace at Rosyth, .the German Air Force, if prepared to

Two squadrons would be stationed atRosyth permanently;    a third would be added when there was a capital ship in dry-dock, and a total of four squadrons would be there when the whole fleet was present.    The ground organisation for all foursquadrons would, however, be kept permanently readyat the aerodromes.   Meanwhile, a further safeguardwould be provided by the earmarking of additionalFighter Squadrons which could be  called up from theSouth at very short notice, to reinforce the existingsquadrons at Rosyth in the event of a really heavy attack.   This action would, of course, depend on thegeneral air situation at the time.    It would involvethe weakening of our defences elsewhere, which mustbe accepted, but he felt that this should not be done at the expense of weakening our defences in front of the Aircraft Industry.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY expressed hisentire satisfaction at these and the other arrange-ments which had been described.The War Cabinet took note of theab ov e s t a. t erne nt....
