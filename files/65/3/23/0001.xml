W.M.(59) 44th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 10.Confidential Anne*x.STAFF contacts with BELGIUM.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that theOfficer detailed to accompany M. Stein on his visit to the Royal Palace at Brussels, was returning todayby air.   On his arrival, therefore, it would be possibleto kno\v whether M. Stein had in fact been charged withthe highly secret mission which he had claimed had been entrusted to him by King Leopold.    In addition, admiral sir Roger Keyes had, the previous day, received throughBaron de Cs-rtier, the Belgian Ambassador, an invitation from the King of the Belgians that he should pay a shortvisit to his mother, Queen Elizabeth.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was difficult to reconcile the activities of M. St*in and the invitationaccorded to Sir Roger Keyes with the statement reportedto the War Cabinet at their meeting held the previous day, that the Belgian Government were deeply distressedat our action in continuing to press for the initiation of Anglo-Belgian Staff Conversations, except on thehypothesis that in the highly dangerous and embarrassing position in which he found himself, Sss^fe Leopold was,cting behind, the backof his Ministers.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY agreed that thiswas probably the true explanation;    the action of theKing associating himself with the views expressed by theBelgian Government through Baron de Cartier might well bedue to a desire on his part to esta/establish a corroborativecamouflage of his own a.actions .The War Cabinet took note of theab ov e &amp;is cus s ion.Richmond Terra.ce, S.W.1,11th October, 1939.
