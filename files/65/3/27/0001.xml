19 4- MOST SECRET -   &apos;IW.M.(39) 48th OON PLUS IONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.*        *        9NAVAL OPERATIONS. THE CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF said that no announcement had yet been made by the Germans as to where the ROYAL OAK had been sunk.    If, as seemedalmost certain, she had been sunk by a U-Boat, itappeared to be a reasonable inference tha.t the U-Boathad not communicated with Germany because she was still inside Scapa Flow.    In spite of considerable pressure from the Press, therefore, the Admiraltydid not intend, for the moment, to disclose that theROYAL OAK had been sunk in harbour, since suchdisclosure would prevent us from knowing through the medium of German announcements whether or not theU-Boat had escaped.    The U-Boat xras being activelyhunted, so as to prevent her coming to the surface,even at night, without detection.    If she was stillinside the Flow, her destruction or capture was onlya matter of time.On the information available, it seemed that theU-Boat had entered through the gate in the anti-submarine net some 24 hours before the attack on theROYAL OAK had been made.;    i.e., about 10 p.m. on the night of Thursday, 12th October.   Earlier on Thursdayafternoon there had been a German air reconnaissance of Scapa, which would have disclosed the presence ofH.M.S. REPULSE and H.M.S. FURIOUS in the Flow. It was probably these vessels, which had left the Flow inthe afternoon, that the U-Boat was a.fter.-1-

The Chief of the Naval Staff described themeasures taken to increase the security of Scapa Plowagainst submarine and aircraft attack.    It was anticipated that these measures would be completed in about a fortnight&apos;s time.The War Cabinet were informed of the movements of the Fleet in the immediate future.Ri richmond T terrace ce, S .W. 1,15th October, 1939

Confidential Annex.* * *GERMANY. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had received a further telegram (No. 147,dated 14th October, 1939) from His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at The Hague, regarding the activities of Dahlerus,who had stated on the telephone that afternoon from berlin that the atmosphere there was distinctly more hopeful.   He (Dahlerus) had just come from a two hours&apos;conversation with Marshal Goering, and suggested thatan informal meeting of German, French, and british representatives might take place to disGuss thesituation.   The King of Sweden would, Dahlerus added,be ready to convene such a meeting.   Dahlerus would himself be ready to proceed to The Hague or to london with proposals.   He was anxious to know in any casewhether His Majesty&apos;s Government would agree in principle^to any such scheme.The chief interest in this telegram was,in theopinion of the Secretary of State, the evidence whichit afforded as to ohe mentality of the German Governmenwho appeared still to consider that the discussion ofpeace terms was possible.   He (the Secretary of State)proposed to inform Dahlerus, through Sir Nevile Bland,that the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government had beenmade clear by the Prime Minister in the statement whichhe had made in the House of Commons on Thursday, 12thOctober, 1939, in which the German Government had been invited to put forward proposals to establish the sincerity of their desire for peace.    If Dahlerus wasin possession of definite proposals from the German

Government, these should, be put into writing, so that both His Majesty1 s Government and the French government might be able to consider them.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was in agreementwith the message proposed, to be sent to Dahlerus,since, by taking the line suggested, we should, bemaintaining the position which we had previously taken up.    It had the merit also that, if later the factthat these advances had. been made by the GermanGovernment became known, a reply on these lines wouldbe of assistance in meeting the. criticism of those persons who thought that the attitude which we hadtaken up towards Germany was too unbending.   He (thePrime Minister) did not think it likely that the GermanGovernment would permit any leakage of informa.tion onthis matter, since it would be highly damaging to them if it became known that they had made surreptitiousadvances of this kind.    This  conclusion was supportedalso by the fact that (as the War Cabinet wouldrecall) Dahlerus had been most insistent that he(the Prime Minister) should make no reference in his speech to any such discussions.The War Cabinet -Took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs, and agreed that he shoulddespatch a telegram to His Majesty&apos;ambassador, The Ha.gue, on the lines suggested in his statement as summarised, above.
