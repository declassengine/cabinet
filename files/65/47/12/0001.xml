Copy NO..../..9-52W.M.(hh) 115TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 3.Confidential Annex(31st August, -\9kh -6 p.m.)ROCKET ATTACK.(previous reference:W.M.(hh) 98thConclusions,Minute 1)THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OP HOME SECURITYrecalled that at their meeting on 28th July the WarCabinet had assigned to the Rocket ConsequencesCommittee the work, of concerting action and plans to-meet the effects of rocket attack on the scale whichthen seemed possible..    A report on the work done bythe Committee had been prepared for the War Cabinet.In the meantime, however, fresh information had beenobtained which suggested that the weight of rocketattack was likely to be less than had been expected.Moreover, the progress of the Allied armies on theContinent might very soon affect the enemy&apos;s ability to launch a rocket attack on this country.     Some ofthe plans which the Rocket Consequences Committee hadbeen considering involved drastic action (e.g. it hadbeen proposed that in the event of attack there mightbe a considerable evacuation of Government staffsfrom London), and it seemed desirable that, before any action was taken which might have the effect of making them public, the plans should be reconsidered in thelight of the latest appreciation of the likely scale of attack.   . He had therefore asked the Chiefs ofStaff to prepare a revised appreciation and hesuggested that the War Cabinet should authorise theRocket Consequences ^Committee to base their plans onthis revised appreciation.THE JOINT PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THEMINISTRY OP SUPPLY explained that until recently theestimates of the size of the warhead of the rockethad been based on air photographs, which had tended to be misleading.      In consultation with the Chiefs ofStaff he was preparing a revised appreciation, which seemed likely to show that, on the least favourableassumption, the average scale of combined rocket and flying bomb attack was likely to be not more than80 tons of high explosive per day falling in theLondon region, as compared with h8 tons during the worst week of the flying bomb attacks.     While therate of progress of the Allied armies was difficult to forecast, there was reasonable ground for hope thatthe attacks would not continue on any appreciablescale after the 15th October.It had also to be remembered that the rapidadvance of our forces, the bombing of rocket storagedepots and special fuel plants, the interruption of communications and the difficulties of meeting theGerman Army&apos;s competing demands for transport and supplies might well force the enemy to abandon

altogether the proposed rocket bombardment.   &apos; It was unlikely that Germany would operate from any sitesWithin 50 miles of the front line, and although somesporadic attacks might be made from Holland there wasno reason to believe that they would be on any greatscale.The following points were made in discussion:-(a) In reply to a question whether the largesites previously associated with rocketpreparations could still be regarded as having any connection with rocket attack,THE CHIEF OF AIR STAFF said that the enemy were still repairing certain of these largesites and that they might possibly beintended for use as rocket- stores.     Theabsence of reliable evidence as to where theenemy had his rocket stores made it impossibleto direct bombing attacks against them.(b) THE HOME SECRETARY pointed out that the heaviest weight of high explosive dropped in London during the raids, of 191+0/hl wash80 tons a week, which compared with 5^0tons on the figures quoted by the joint parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofSupply.(c) THE. PAYMASTER GENERAL referred to thedifficulty which the enemy would experience in providing trained men to fire therockets.     He also pointed.out that theprocess of jamming the radio control ofrockets would be much easier once we couldestablish transmitters on land within areasonable distance of the firing sites..The general feeling of the War Cabinet was thatit seemed unlikely that the scale of attack would be asheavy as was indicated in the appreciation quoted bythe Joint Parllamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofSupply, who had taken the least favourable assumptionin making - his new appreciation.   Even so, however,the new appreciation was much more favourable than -,that oh which the Committee had been asked to base their plans at the meeting of the War Cabinet on28th July atid it was clearly desirable that the RocketConsequences Committee should review their report onthe new basis.The War Cabinet --Endorsed the proposal of the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security that the,Rocket Consequences Committee should base their plans on the revisedappreciation.Offices of the War Oabinet, S.W.1.
