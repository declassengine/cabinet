(Ltk) 110thonclusions,minute 1)THE FOREIGN SECRETARY informed the War Cabinetthat he had had a long and rather difficult discussionwith the Poles that afternoon.     The Poles in Warsaw were,of course, undergoing terrible sufferings.     Besides theheavy casualties in fighting, there were reports ofy/wholesale massacres of Poles by the Germans.     The Poleshad found it difficult to understand how it was that wecould make a heavy air attack on Kttnigsberg, but were unable to send help to the Polish Underground Army in warsaw.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that the two operations were not comparable.      Kttnigsberg had been bombed from about 18,000 feetu     The flight there had beenmostly over the sea.     To drop supplies to the PolishUnderground Army in Warsaw it would be necessary for our aircraft to fly at an altitude of about 1,000 feet, andat a very low speed (about. 11+0 miles per hour).     Warsawwas very strongly defended by flak.     As the War cabinet were aware, hitherto the flights which had been made forthe purpose of dropping supplies in Warsaw had beencarried out by Polish volunteers flying, from Italy.     TheAir Officer Commanding-in-Chief in the.Mediterranean was coming to the conclusion that the operation was attended by such high risks that it could scarcely be regarded asan &quot;operation of war&quot;.     On the lastonights nine aircraft had been despatched, of which one had dropped suppliessuccessfully and four had been lost.     Furthermore, ourown pilots were put in a difficult position, since theywere not allowed to carry out this operation but thePoles were allowed to volunteer for it.Reference was made to the military situationround Warsaw.     There was no doubt that the Russians had suffered a  setback;       and all the evidence went to show, that they were doing their utmost to reach Warsaw.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY then referred to thepolitical aspects of the situation.     There was nodoubt that the Polish Government were placed in an increasingly awkward position through not having beenable to secure more effective &quot;help from the Allies tothe Polish Underground Army fighting in Warsaw.     the rev/as a considerable risk that the Polish Government mightfall before a combination of Generals and Socialists.Further messages had also been received by the Poles andcommunicated to him, to the effect that the leaders ofthe Underground Army, as the Russians advanced, werebeing seized and deported-.The Foreign Secretary said that he was sureit was of the utmost importance that we should do everything we could to avoid the increasing bitterness-1-

of relations between the Russians and the Poles as aresult of this situation.     He did not, however, see what we could do, beyond publishing the proposed declaration to the effect that we recognised the Polish UndergroundArmy as a fully combatant force entitled to normaltreatment under the lav/s and customs of war.     In reply toa.question, the Foreign Secretary said that he did not propose to consult the Russians about the terms of this declaration.     After alii it was we who had armed thePolish Underground Army, and we had special obligations in regard to it. -THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION said he thought we could not reckon for long on the Press maintainingsilence about the present difficulties between poland and Russia and, in particular, about the Russian refusal- to allow- the United States air forces the use ofairfields In Russia for the purpose of dropping supplies to the Polish Underground Army in Warsaw.     When thefacts were published he was afraid that the resultingsituation would be prejudicial to unity between theUnited Nations.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said he thought that whennews of these difficulties was published it would be best that it should first be published in the American ratherthan the British Press, since if the news first brokein the British Press we should be accused of making badblood between the Russians and the Americans.The Foreign Secretary invited his colleagues to suggest what further action we could take to relieve the situation.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested, that we shouldhave further communication and negotiations with theRussians, with a view to trying to get an accommodation.The War Cabinet were reminded of the exchange of telegrams which had taken nlace  between the Prime Minister,Premier Stalin and the President.       Premier Stalin&apos;telegram of the 22nd August (CLASP No. 185) was read to the War. Cabinet.     In the light of this telegram itwas difficult to see what would be secured by a further approach to Premier Stalin.&quot; After some farther discussion, the War cabinet agreed as follows:-&apos; (1)   The question whether further flights of aircraft from Italy to Warsaw should be permitted shouldbe referred for the decision of the PrimeMinister and Minister of Defence Immediately onhis return.(2)   Authority was given to publish the proposed declaration to the effect that we recognised thePolish Underground Army as a. fully combatantforce, as now revised by the Foreign Secretary,subject to the approval of the Prime Minister.(3)    It was suggested that when we were ready to publish the declaration the Foreign secretary should endeavour to secure from M. Mikolajesiykan assurance that, if the declaration was published, he would remain in office as PrimeMinister.of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.   &apos;
