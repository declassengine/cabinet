THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.TOP Jt is issued for the personal use of................SECRET.35Copy No..W.M.(Uh.) 107TH OONCLUSIOHS. MINUTE XConfidential Annex(16th August. 19hh - 12.30 p.m.)POLAND(previous reference:W.M.(U4) 106thConclusions,Minute 3)At their meeting on li+th August the WarCabinet had been informed that Premier stalin had promised to send supplies to the Polesfighting in Warsaw, and to drop a liaison officer to make the necessary arrangements.They now had before them telegrams nos. 2131, 2132, 212+1 and 212+2 of 15th Augustfrom Ambassador Clark-Kerr.     A liaison officerhad been dropped by the Russians, hut had been killed.     The Soviet Government had now expressed their unwillingness to agree to a proposal thatunits of the American Air Force should drop armsat a point outside Warsaw for the Poles fighting in the city.     They had taken the line that the rising was the work of adventurers and that theSoviet Government&quot;could not lend its hand to it&quot;.Strong representations by the United Kingdom and united States Ambassadors had failed to change their attitude.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the resultingsituation was one of great delicacy.     Whatevermight be the reasons actuating the Russians intaking the line they had, the consequences onRusso-Polish and Anglo-Soviet relations (and onthe position of Monsieur Mikolajczyk having regardto Premier StalinTs undertaking to him) of a refusal to help the Poles now fighting in Warsawcould not but be most unfortunate.     He felt it essential to press the Russians as strongly aspossible to reconsider their decision, and heread to the War Cabinet the terms of a draft telegram in that sense (copy attached) which he .proposed to send to Ambassador Clark-Kerr, andrepeat to Washington.     The matter was of suchgravity that he thought it desirable, further, thatthe Prime Minister should be invited to telegraph,if he saw fit, direct to Premier Stalin, and thatMr. Hull should be so informed, and the possibilityof a personal message from President Roosevelt put to him.     Meanwhile,  it was essential that the Polesin this country should not learn the turn whichevents had taken.     With that object in view, he had,in anticipation of the approval of the War Cabinet,spoken to Ambassador Winant and asked him to warnGeneral Spaatz to say nothing to the Poles and, ifapproached by them, to take the line that we were still waiting for a clearance from the Russians for-1-

the use of the forest airfield outside Warsaw.     Hehad also instructed Ambassador 0&apos;Malley to say, ifthe matter was raised with him, that he had no information and to advise M. Mikolajczjpk, if hepressed it, to come and see the Foreign Secretary.He asked the War Cabinet to approve the action hehad taken and.to advise him whether he should himself say anything to the Poles*     His own judgement was in favour of saying nothing until we saw the result of our endeavours to secure a reversal of the Russian decision.&apos;.XfIn discussion the following amendments were suggested to the draft telegram toAmbassador Clark-Kerr -(a)   Add, at end of paragraph 2:    &quot;HithertoSoviet line has been to condemn inactivityof Polish Underground Movement, and publicopinion in this and other Allied countries will consider the constant exhortations tothe Polish population by the Soviet press and wireless.to rise and attack Germans impose a strong moral obligation on the SovietGovernment to help the Poles&quot;now fighting in warsaw&quot;.(b)    Paragraph 5:. after &quot;&quot;&quot;par!(c)first sentence:^__-     parliamentary and public opinion&quot;,insert &quot;of all political parties&quot;.Paragraph .7:Add &quot;The immediate need is that Soviet.Government should reverse their decision in respect of American aircraft, and give them forthwith necessary facilities fortheir task&quot;.The War Cabinet -(l)   Approved the draft telegram proposedby the Foreign Secretary subject to the amendments at &apos;X! above.(2)   Approved the action taken by him, and invited him to communicate as proposedwith the Prime Minister and Mr. Hull.(3)   Agreed that it would be preferable thathe should say nothing to the Poles untilthe outcome was known of the proposedfurther representations to the SovietGovernment.Offices of the War Cabinet, s.w. 1.

annex draft Telegram to Sir A. Clark-KerrYour telegrams Nos. 2131, 2132, 21M and 21h2(of August 1hth:    Assistance for Warsaw).I fully approve action you have taken and yourlanguage to M. Vyshinsky.     Issues at stake are, however,of such vital importance, going as they do far beyond theimmediate fate of the Polish population of Warsaw, that you should make every effort to see Marshal Stalin personally or if this is impossible, M. Molotov, to &quot;bring home to them thevery serious view which His Majesty&apos;s Government take of theirpresent attitude and our deep anxiety regarding its probable effect not only upon Polish-Soviet hut also upon futureAnglo-Soviet relations.2. Despite the Soviet Governmenfs return to theattitude of scepticism expressed in,Marshal Stalin&apos;s message tothe Prime Minister of August 5th (Foreign Office telegramNo. 21+1 h) they do not and have never denied that the Polesin Warsaw are fighting against the Germans.     It is, of course,only too true that they lack heavy armaments and aircraft,but, as you rightly pointed out, this is a disability whichthey share with many other partisan and underground forcesthroughout Europe which have, nevertheless, in our. experiencerendered most valuable services to the allied cause.     We had always understood that Marshal Stalin attributed similarimportance to the efforts of Russian partisans and of thosePoles who, whatever their political persuasion, had in response to exhortations from Soviet as well as Polish sourcesjoined actively in the fight against the common enemy.-3. His Majesty&apos;s Government have always been guided bythe principle that whoever fights the Germans should receiveall the support which the more powerful among the united nations can supply.     Without, therefore, attempting to judgeexactly the extent or the political colour of the resistance of Warsaw, we&apos; conceive that there is a strong moral obligationupon the three major allies to do what they can, consistent with their other operational commitments, to render assistance.Despite geographical and other difficulties, we are doing our best, at relatively heavy cost.      It is, of course, for theSoviet Government to decide what action they can take in fulfilment of Marshal Stalin&apos;s undertaking to M. Mikolajczyk.We should, however, be wanting in the frankness proper betweenallies if we did not repeat our conviction that the completeabsence of such assistance will be misinterpreted and seriously prejudice future Polish-Soviet relations.     Nor can we see anyjustification whatever for the Soviet Governmenfs decisionto refuse the necessary facilities required hy our Americanallies to make their contribution to relieve Warsaw.h. What is, however, equally important is the effect of.the latest Soviet attitude upon M. Mikolajczyk&apos;s position andtherefore upon the prospect of an eventual satisfactory solution of the Polish problems.      It is clear from his own account of his talks in Moscow (see my telegram No. 2533) thatM. Mikolajczyk has returned with the determination to basehis future policy upon faith in Soviet good intentions.     Heis prepared to go very far with his colleagues here to bringabout a solution in the sense desired hy the Soviet Government.

His main trump card in playing his difficult hand was marshal stalin&apos;s undertaking to send help to Warsaw,     He. has nodoubt already made much of this and it is a matter to whichthe Polish troops now fighting so effectively in Italy,Normandy and elsewhere naturally attribute the highest importance.     If the present Soviet attitude is maintainedI fear Mi Mikolajczyl^e personal position will be fatally,harmed.     At the best, he will be unable to proceed at thisstage with the efforts he is now making to unite Polishpolitical forces behind a policy of friendship with theSoviet Union.     At the worst, the possibility of such&apos;asettlement may be Irretrievably compromised.5. Important sections of British Parliamentary and publicopinion are already showing grave anxiety over the Warsawsituation and apparent Soviet inaction.     We have hithertodone our best to present the facts in the most favourablepossible light.     If, however, the present negative Sovietattitude is maintained suspicions concerning Soviet good faith and future Soviet intentions will be confirmed and may wellreceive public expression with result useful only to the enemy and highly damaging to Anglo-Soviet relations.6. I realise that considerations of professional militaryjealousy mentioned at the end of your telegram No. 211+1 may beat the bottom of this.     The issues are, however, too important to permit petty considerations of this kind to prevail.     TheSoviet authorities seem to have lost all sense of proportionalready over the Vilna story, to which they continually refer.In fact, the Poles only claimed to have made a very smallcontribution and there has been little publicity even to this effect.      The world at large is hardly likely to depreciatethe tremendous contribution of the Red Army to the liberation of Poland, or to lose sight of this merely because allied air forces, who have specialised in long-distance operations of this kind, have dropped small quantities of supplies in warsaw.      If, however, the Soviet air force, can assist us or take over this task from us, we shall willingly acquiesce and give them all the credit.7, Please endeavour to associate your United Statescolleague with you in the above representations, but you should not delay them on that account.
