(UU) 108TH conclusions confidential Annex(18th August, i9kk - 5.0 p.m.)POLAND.(previous reference:W.M.(kk) 107thConclusions,Minute 1)THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said he desired toinform his colleagues of the latest developments in connection with the provision of relief forPoland.     Following on the conversation betweenthe United Kingdom and United States Ambassadors,reported to the War Cabinet at their meeting on16th August (W.M.(kh) 107th Conclusions, Minute 1),Premier Stalin had telegraphed in very similarterms to the Prime Minister adding that he was nowconvinced that the Warsaw action v/as a reckless andterrible adventure, from which the Soviet Command,which had not been informed before the action beganand with which contact had not been maintained bythe Poles, had decided that it must dissociateitself.Since the matter was last before the War ,Cabinet on 16th August there had been an exchangeof telegrams direct between M. Mikolajczyk andPremier Stalin, in which Premier Stalin had taken the same general line as in his reply, to the PrimeMinister, though he had not referred to theproposed American operation.     While it easedour own position that the Poles should be madeavare of the Russian attitude direct, and while they had not reacted too badly to it, they werenot yet aware of the difficulties which theRussians were making over permission for Americans  -to drop assistance for the Underground Army in warsaw.     M. Mikolajcsyk was this afternoonreplying to Premier Stalin in what appeared to bevery conciliatory language, urging the case for russian assistance both on merits and in the interestof future relations between Poland and Russia.THE FOREIGN. SECRETARY added- that he remainedvery uneasy at the probable reactions of world opinion to any failure on the part of the russians to give effective assistance to the Poles.     Hehad seen Ambassador Winant who, in response to hisappeal, had undertaken again to press the president to intervene with Premier Stalin.     He suggestedthat he should be authorised(i) to telegraph to the Prime Minister inthe sense of the draft, of which a copyas subsequently despatched is attached,urging him to bring such pressure ashe thought wise to bear on Premier Stalii-1-

(il) when he saw M., Gusev later this afternoon to do all he could to influence him in the right direction.He would give him copies of certain, S.O.E. messages which we had had from.A.P. personnel in Warsaw whichbrought out that there had been,a gooddeal of genuine fighting and thatPolish morale was good and standing. up well to the situation, and wouldtell the Ambassador, if it seemed likelyto be of value, that the Deputy Prime. Minister would be prepared to receivehim.In the discussion which followed the follow-ing points were made -(i) That any communication from the PrimeMinister to Premier Stalin should emphasise the vital importance of&apos;X&apos;I allowing the American Air Force to drop supplies and thereafter land on Russian aerodromes.     The risk thatthe Russians might concede this, butdo nothing themselves to help the Poles,was accepted.     But it was felt that russian agreement to allow the dropping of supplies would help to ease thestrained relations otherwise probablebetween Russia   and Poland.(ii) While Premier Stalin had claimed thatthe Underground rising in Warsaw v/asa terrible and reckless adventure whichhad no chance of success against fourGerman tank divisions, the point might. be made that if those divisions were fighting in Warsaw they were notfighting elsewhere, and that the forcesdirectly opposed to the Russians wereto that extent reduced.     The point might be used in the Foreign Secretary&apos;sconversation with M. Gusev.The War Cabinet -(a) Took note of the foreign secretary&apos;s report;(b) Approved the action contemplated by him and&quot;the draft telegram to the Prime Minister subjectto an addition to meet the point at &apos;X&apos;.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.

CLASP HO. 116 18th August, 19hh.Following for Prime Minister from Foreign Secretary.Reference U.J.&apos;s message to you in CLASP NO. 90,and telegram No. 21 6h from Moscow.These telegrams reveal an attitude of mind on thepart of the Russians which is causing us gravest anxiety.They appear to take- no account whatever of effects hot onlyon Polish hut on British and American opinion of Stalin&apos;s- ,action in going.hack on his promise to Mikolajczyk withoutany serious cause.      I feel that despite definite nature of   -Soviet reply we must continue to press them.      I am seeing-Gousev this afternoon and shall speak to him mainly on thebasis of the effect of this Russian decision on Anglo-soviet relations.2. 3/[eanwhile Mikolajczyk had himself communicated with, J. and&apos; has now received a reply on the same lines as thatwhich U.J. sent to you, though Mikolajczyk does not yet know of the refusal to allow Americans to use Russian aerodrome.So far the Poles have taken the situation .calmly and Romereven professes to believe that the Russians may yet change their minds,      I&quot;have the impression however that Poles are fully conscious of the strong case they are building up beforeworld opinion;3i I.have kept Winant posted of developments and havegiven him copy of D,J.&apos;s reply to you (CLASP 90) for thePresident only.     We have heard nothing from Washington yetas to any action they may have taken.     I do not know whether you have drafted anything to U.J. yourself in response to myCLASP 8h and in reply to his message, but-my own advice wouldbe that you should return to the charge, in particular inrespect of use of Russian aerodrome by American aircraft.      Ihave not yet received the account of Clark Kerr&apos;s three hourinterview.     This will be repeated to you the moment itreaches me.To0.0. 182155ZTOP SECRET CYPHER TELEGRAM
