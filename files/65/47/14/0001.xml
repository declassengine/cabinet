Copy No.....f...\.(hh) 117th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE confidential Annex(5th September,. 19Li4 - 5 p.m.)POLAND,(previous reference;W.M.(hk)115thConclusions,Minute 2).THE FOREIGN SECRETARY informed the War Cabinetthat following on General Sosnowski&apos;s statementpublished in today&apos;s press, it had seemed likely that M. .Mikolajczyk, who had taken particular exception to the suggestion that Poland had not come into thewar of her own accord, would resign.    The Prime Minister,with whom ho had discussed the matter yesterday, feltmost strongly that this must not be allowed, and thatif his resignation took place, we should give no support.to a successor of an anti-Russian complexion.He had done his utmost to urge M. Mikolajczyk to stand firm, and had told him that a further appeal onbehalf of Warsaw had been sent to Premier Stalin,and that the Prime Minister was also in correspondence with the President.    He had also asked the Ministerof Labour to give what assistance he could through his friends in the Polish Cabinet,THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that ho had urgedon M. Stanwyck the importance of keeping the Governmentgoing.   He understood that M. Mikolajczyk had now decided not to resign, but in the first instance toask the advice of the leader of the Underground Armyin Warsaw.    A meeting of Polish Socialists in london had by a majority decided to call the Socialistmembers out of the Polish Government.    M. Stanwyckhad, however, now asked for the advice of the LabourMinisters in the British Cabinet as to the desirabilityof keeping M. Mikolajczyk in office.    The Ministerof Labour was consulting his colleagues and, in the -light of their views; would do everything possibleto strengthen M. Mikolajczyk.    The position would atany rate be held for the next three or four dayspending a reply from Warsaw to M. Mikolajozyk&apos;senquiry.    M. Stanwyck felt that it would bo fatal to break up the Government until it was known definitely that we and the United States Government had failedin our endeavours to persuade the Russians to grantfacilities for air assistance to Warsaw.The War Cabinet -Took note of the statements by theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Minister of Labour.Aid for Warsaw. THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that in the courseof his discussions with M, Mikolajczyk, the Polish- Prime Minister had repeated that he was not convinced that we could not carry out the operationinvolved in taking supplies to Warsaw from thiscountry.    The Vice -Chief of tho Air Staff had been

good enough to explain the position to him and hesuggested that he should now tell the Cabinet howmatters stood.The Vice-Chief, of the Air Staff said that thedifficulties seen hy the Air Staff coincided withthe practical judgment of the Commanders on the spot.The most efficient way of helping Warsaw- was from theMediterranean.     That view had been pressed most stronglyon the Commander on the spot, who had been given everysupport for which he asked to conduct operations from italy.     In the last three weeks about 18.2. sorties hadbeen flown from the M.A.A.F. in support of Warsaw.From these, 35 aircraft were missing;    88 successfulor approximately successful deliveries had been achieved at various points, not all of them within Warsaw.Taking account of 5 aircraft so badly damaged as to beno longer serviceable, one aircraft was missing forevery 2.5 successes;       and 1 aircraft missing or destroyed for every 2.3 successes, .      The last attemptmade was three nights ago when,out of the seven aircraftused, four had&quot;been lost.     No more would be sent duringthe present moon period.The Poles had, however, been urging a large droppingoperation from the United Kingdom rather than from Italy,and a meeting had been arranged at the Air Ministrybetween the Poles, the Air Staff and the United Statesstaff.     The United States representatives had at firstcontemplated daylight operations with a low drop from about 500 feet and fighter escort.     Subsequently, inview of the considerable German flak defence and thedanger represented by Russian flak owing to the difficultyof identification, they had decided that dropping couldnot take place from a lower height than 10,000 feet withspecial containers.     Of material so dropped, not morethan 10 per cent could be relied on to reach the Poles.In other words the operation would be a gesture, themilitary value of which would be small.   . It would, ofcourse, be conditional oii the planes being able to flyon to Russian landing grounds.&quot;bomber Command     felt that dropping operations by night would involve technical considerations and a risk of fighter opposition which the Commander-in-Chief,Bomber Command, would not consider justifiable.      ThePoles-had been asked to discuss the matter with him.Some misconception seemed to have resulted.      GeneralSosnowski had derived the feeling that the operation was practicable under certain conditions.      Air Chief MarshalHarris regarded this as a misrepresentation, of theresults of the- talk.      He made it clear that he could not discuss policy which-was a matter for S.H.A.E.F.;    andthat as regards technical considerations, in no circumstances whatsoever would the operation be feasiblein moonlight;    (the present moon period would end on12th September);    to fly to and fro, aircraft would haveto fly direct to Warsaw over the main German nightfighter forces with a probable 30 per cent loss, which,in his judgment, ruled the operation out.     A possible alternative if aircraft could fly on to Italian landing grounds would be via the Baltic to ?\farsaw.      This wastechnically possible but also involved the risk of very high casualties, and could not in any case be carried out during the moonlight period.

.&apos;   .   The operation involved was thus in any circumstances very serious, and it was unlikely to &quot;beof very great value to the Poles.     Small as was thepercentage of load likely to drop in the right area&quot;by day, it was. still smaller by night though the precisefigure must be a matter of conjecture.     On the otherhand, the daylight operation.by the United States wouldbe a great fillip to Polish morale if it could beachieved without great loss to ourselves.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY felt that if approximately10 per cent of the drop was all that was likely to.reach the Poles from an operation of the character whichwe had been urging on the Russians, it made a certaindifference to the picture.     He suggested that atelegram should be sent to the Chief of the Air Staff,for the Prime Minister&apos;s information, to make sure thathe was aware of this point.The Vice-Chief -of the Air Staff undertook toarrange for this to be done.The War Cabinet:-Took note of the position as explained bythe Vice-Chief of the Air Staff and agreedthat the Air Staff could not be asked todo more than had in fact been done.Offices of the War Cabinet,  S.W.1.
