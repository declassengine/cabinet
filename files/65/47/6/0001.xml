MINUTE confidential Annex(27th July, 1944 - 6.0 p.m9)&quot;CROSSBOW&quot;(previous reference:W.M.(44) 95 th conclusions,Minute 4).The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security(W.P. (44) 412) proposing that the Govez*nment-plans fordealing with attacks on London by long-range rocketsshould be re-examined.THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OP HOME SECURITYreminded the War Cabinet that about a year ago theyhad authorised the making of paper plans for dealing   -with long-range rocket attacks on.London,     The plans were to be such as could be put into operation withoutmaterially affecting the war effort and were to bebased on a stand firm policy.Subsequently it had appeared that attacks by flying bombs were more likely and attention had been concentrated on this threat.     The flying bomb attacks,which had produced nearly 1,600 incidents in Londoninvolving about 16,000 fatal or serious casualties and damage to nearly 700,000 houses, had put.a considerablestrain on the civil population.The Government were now informed that therewas considerable evidence to show that the flyingbomb attacks were likely to be supplemented by long-range rocket attacks.      Each rocket might carry a7-ton warhead, of which 5if tons might consist ofaluminised explosive, and the enemy might have astock of about 1,000 rockets.     Allowing a reasonablemargin for error, he had come to the conclusion thata rocket attack on the scale which now seemed likelywould produce 18,000 fatal casualties, with perhapsas much as three times that number of seriously wounded.The rocket attack must therefore be regardedas a major effort by the enemy.      So far as activedefences were concerned, he.could only press for themost energetic measures.     With regard to plans forpassive defence, military assistance and additionalbuilding labour would be needed for the clearance ofdebris and the repair of damaged houses in London.It would also be necessary to prepiare for a largeexodus of population and to make hospital accommodation available for casualties.     He had discussed theproblem with the Minister of Health and the&apos; Ministerof Information and was satisfied that if properpreparations were to be made the Government must givethe public a clearer picture of the scale of attack which was now envisaged.     Past experience had shownthat public morale was strengthened if the Governmenttold people frankly what they must expect in theway of attacks.-1

THE MINISTER OP HEALTH said that he was trying toencourage the.evacuation of the priority -classes andwould like to extend these classes to include motherswi&apos;th school children.      The present registration figures were,&quot;however, disappointing and he felt, that some statement about the expected scale of attack was essential in order to stimulate organised evacuation.He had asked Regional Commissioners to review the plans for dealing with an unorganised exodus from london.      If the arrangements were to be brought up.to&apos; a proper state of readiness, however, it wasnecessary to give the voluntary workers on whom theydepended some indication of the kind of emergency forwhich they were preparing.     Apart from the damage to house property in London, there would also be theserious problem of providing for the chattels ofpersons whose homes were destroyed.      The scale of casulties expected made it essential to clearhospitals in London, either in whole or in part, andhe was advised that the best plan would be to clear the London Hospitals completely.      This operation would take&apos; from three to four weeks.the MINISTER OP INPORMATION supported theproposal that the public should be given more information about the expected scale of attack.THE MINISTER OP WAR TRANSPORT said that,  onthe assumption that there was no serious dislocation of the railways through damage, it would be possibleto transport about 80,000 persons a day from Londona considerable distance, without serious interferencewith normal passenger services.      If the task were limited to carrying people some 20 to 25 miles out ofLondon, as many.as 250,000 a day might be moved.He drew attention to the fact that at the present timetrains coming to London were almost as crowded astrains from London.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said thathe had examined the problem of Civil Service Staffsfrom the point of view of maintaining the efficiency of the Government machine.      Of the 130,000 headquartersstaffs in London, about 10,000 were in poor ,accommodation (from the point of view of&apos; air attack)with no shelter accommodation whatever, and immediate action was required to improve their position.      Itwas estimated that the minimum number of essentialstaffs, who ought to be provided with accommodation sothat they could work continuously, was 17,000.      this figure, however, was calculated on the assumptionthat the period of emergency was short-lived.      After -about two or three weeks, it would be necessary to make provision for another 50,000.      The existing protected accommodation would, however, only house about 12,000.It was essential,- therefore, to plan some rearrangement of Government staffs, including the removal of certainnon-essential . staff s fx^om London, when the attacksdeveloped. .   The official committee which had previouslydealt with the removal of Government staffs from london should be asked to prepare revised plans.

.    THE MINISTER OP PRODUCTION AND THE MINISTER OPAIRCRAFT PRODUCTION pointed out that flying bomb -attacks had already caused a considerable reductionof output in the London area.      The need to disperseproduct!on had been foreseen and already a certaindegree of dispersal had taken place. -   This processcould be continued and plans could be made to accelerate it. : .THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL service said that if the damage to property in London reached a certain level, it might be more profitable to drawworkers engaged on war production away from.Londonrather than face the drain on man power involved inthe carrying out of first aid repairs.     He attached great importance to the co-ordination of the plans for shifting production with the arrangements for moving the civil population.     Arrangements (e.g. bythe provision of day nurseries) should be made inreception&apos; areas to enable mothers -with children toundertake productive work.     He also suggested thatit would be wise to consider extending the period.of double summer time beyond 13th August, since-the longer light would be of help in connection with civil defence measures.THE PAYMASTER GENERAL said that he was inclined to think that the assumptions made by the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Home Security as to thescale of attack were unduly pessimistic.     He doubted,whether the available stocks of rockets were as largoas had been suggested.      The enemy had&apos;not so far  :used aluminised explosive in flying bombs and it was,questionable whether the size of the rocket warheadwould be as great as had been suggested.     Again, theestimate of damage and casualties were based on a degree of accuracy which the rocket was unlikely to achieve.      The rocket depended on,radio control andwe- should be able to develop countermeasures whichwould affect its accuracy.      So far as german propaganda went,  there was little evidence to showthat the launching of rocket attacks was imminent.On the worst assumption, the -weight of attack likelyto be sustained over a period of 12 to 1k days wasnot more than half that sustained in the .19k0-k1 raids.THE JOINT PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THEMINISTRY OF SUPPLY said that in his view the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security had taken a balanced estimated of the probable scale of attack and that arguments could also be adduced in. favourof the view that the scale would be considerably heavier.Reference was made to the ,fact that a -considerable volume of evidence about the rocket had only recently been brought to the notice of Ministers.. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR&quot;AND THE CHIEFOF THE AIR STAFF explained that until recently, whenvaluable information was obtained from prisoners ofwar in Normandy, from Polish sources and from Sweden,the assessment made of the probable scale of attack had had to be very largely guess work.     It was now estimated that the size of the warhead would lie between 3 and 7 tons and was more likely to be in thelower range.     The rocket could, it appeared, be

launched, from a very simple concrete platform whichwas both difficult to identify and to attack.     Allpossible&apos;steps were being taken to find the launching1sites and to obtain information about the arrangements &apos;for the manufacture and storage of the rockets and oftheir fuel and for the transport of rockets to theirfiring sites.     Every effort was being made todevelop our defences, including the provision of apparatus to jam- the radio control.      It must berecognised, however,  that full.development of ourdefences must await actual experience Of the attacks.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security had rightly stressed the importance of preparation to meet&apos; the scale ofrocket attack now expected.      It would, of course,be for the Chiefs of Staff to do everything possibleto prepare our active defences and to direct attacks against any installations (e.g, liquid oxygen plants)which seemed likely to be connected with the enemy&apos;plans.     So far as passive defence was concerned,  thePrime Minister summed up on the lines of the conclusions which follow,,(1) Plans should be made to ,meet the contingency of rocket attacks on the scale which now seemed possible;    and certain action shouldbe taken at once.(2) The following were the matters in regardto which action should be taken forthwith:(a) The evacuation.of the priority classesshould he stimulated, and these classesshould be extended to include mothers   -with schoolchildren. --,j(b) An estimate should be made of the extentto which the population of London hadbeen reduced since the flying bomb attacks held started.    -Enquiry shouldbe made as to the considerable movementof population into London which was reported by railways to be taking place,and as to the reasons for this movement,with a. view to a decision on whether any steps should be taken to check it.   .(c) Steps should be taken, without publicity,to move patients from the Londonhospitals to hospitals in other partsof the -country.     This might involvedrawing on the hospital accommodationset aside for Service casualties.(d) The process of shifting production fromfactories in London to factorieselsewhere should continue, particular attention-being paid to key factories.(e) The 10,000 Government staffs at presenthoused in poor accommodation with no formof shelter should be moved to other accommodation either in London or elsewhere.

.   (f) In his forthcoming statement - on the war   Vsituation, the Prime Minister would give- &apos;   . particulars of the casualties caused, by,-flying bombs, and Would emphasise that members of the priority - classes would dowell to take advantage of the facilitiesfor evacuation.     He undertook to considerpassages-submitted to him by the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home security and the Minister of&apos;Health.(g) In addition editors might be remindedconfidentially ahout the danger of rocketattack in such a way as to keep the-public aware of its possible imminencewhile taking special care not to causealarm.&apos;(h) The Lord Presidents Committee would consider whether, from the point ofview of defence against flying bomb androcket attacks, it would be advisable tocontinue double summer time for a further period after 13th August.        K(3) Plans should he, prepared to meet the contingency of rocket attack on the following lines(a) Transport and accommodation should be available in order to enable up to two;    million additional persons to be evacuated from London to safe areas within a periodof thre&apos;e to four weeks. ,   Alternativeplans should also be made for moving thesame number in a shorter period to a\   distance of some 20 miles from London,(b) The emergency arrangements for dealing witha large exodus on&quot; foot from London shouldbe brought into a state of readiness.(c) Arrangements should be made to enable thesupply of building labour available forthe clearance of debris and the repair ofdamaged houses in London to be reinforcedfrom both civilian and Service sources.(d) The co-ordination of the shifting ofproduction from factories in London to factories elsewhere with the transfer of&quot;the Civil population under ,the evacuationarrangements should be studied.,(e) Arrangements, to be operated in the eventof rocket attack, should be made for theevacuation from London of non-essential-Government staffs and for the allocation7 -        of the most highly protected accomodation to those staffs who must remain in London.(h.) A meeting would be held on the following day to review and confirm the Conclusions setout under (2) and (3) above and to settle the Ministerial responsibility for each item.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
