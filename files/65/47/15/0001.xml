Copy Wo.W.M.(hh)  122ND CONCLUSIONS..MINUTE 7.Confidential Annex(11th Septemher - 5.30 p.m.)POLAND.(previous reference:W.M.(h4) 117thConclusions,Minute 1)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Vice Chief of the Air Staff (W.P.(hh) 513)containing an appreciation of the possibility ofcarrying out an operation by Bomber Command inaccordance with the latest request received fromthe Polish Government that supplies should be dropped to the insurgents in Warsaw under cover ofa bombing attack.     The conclusion reached as aresult of the appreciation was that the operation was militarily unjustifiable.THE VICE CHIEF OP THE AIR STAFF said, that the appreciation had been produced as a result of prolonged consideration over the weekend and consultation with Commander-in-Chief, Bomber Command.A new situation had then been produced by a telegramfrom Moscow which said that the Russian Governmentwere now prepared to grant facilities for an Americanshuttle bombing operation if we still desired tocarry one out.     The Vice Chiefs of Staff had accordingly sent a telegram to General Eisenhower,informing him of the change of attitude on the partof the Russians, and asking whether he would considerthe possibility of mounting an operation with the eighth U.S. Air Force.     The Military Missions in moscow had also been informed and told to do everything possible to make the necessary arrangements at that end.     The Polish Government had also beeninformed of the Moscow telegram. -   No reply had sofar been received from General Eisenhower.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that the War Cabinet ought to decide first of all on the question raised by the appreciation,namely, should an attempt be made by Bomber Command?Could the War Cabinet over-rule the military opinionexpressed in the appreciation that the operation wasnot justifiable?     His own opinion was that thisview should not be over-ruled but he thought it right to warn the War Cabinet that there was considerable political activity on this subject andthat they would have to defend any decision whichthey took in Parliament.In the subsequent discussion the following were the principal points;- . .(a) Our bombers would have to go from the UnitedKingdom, drop their loads in Warsaw and land in Italy.      There was no question oftheir being ahle to land on an airfield inRussia where we had no organisation.

(&quot;b) A number of operations had &quot;been carried outby aircraft from Italy which had dropped,supplies on Warsaw and other parts of Poland.The loss incurred in all these operationsaveraged 16.5 per cent.&apos;   20 aircraft had been dispatched the previous night of which 5.hadnot returned, 5 had dropped successfully&quot;overWarsaw (though not necessarily into Polishhands) and h had dropped blind on estimatedtime of arrival.      Bomber Command estimated thattheir losses on an operation with 120 aircraft would be between 10 and 15 per cent,, for an actual delivery to the Poles of some 10 tons of equipment.(c) It was generally agreed that the arguments againstmixing bombing and supply dropping were over-whelming.      It y/as suggested that a simplebombing operation might be carried out.     the vice- CHIEF OF THE AIR. STAFF pointed out thatbombing of the city ?/ould be as likely to killPoles as Germans and bombing of airfields atthat range in the dark was unlikely to be effective.(d) It was jjointed out that if we carried out theoperation we would almost certainly be pressed by the Poles to repeat it each night for as longas resistance in Warsaw continued.     We shouldalso be blamed for not having done it earlier.&apos;(e) The opinion was expressed that the loss of 10 to15 aircraft was a disproportionate price to pay for the delivery of equipment which could not seriously influence the outcome of the strugglein Warsaw.     On the other hand, it was argued that the decision should not be influenced bythe value of the load delivered.      One shouldrather assume that any assistance to the Poleswas worth while provided the losses which wouldbe incurred were not prohibitive.After full consideration of all these factors theview was unanimously expressed that the opinion of the vice- Chief of the Air Staff should be upheld.Discussion then turned to the question of an operation by the Eighth U.S. Air Force.      The WarCabinet were informed that General Eisenhower had sometime previously received instructions from the UnitedStates Chiefs of Staff which authorised him to carry outoperations to assist the Poles if he felt that somethinguseful could be done.      No reply had so far been receivedfrom General Eisenhower, but the Vice &quot;Chief of the Air-Staff undertook to inform the Foreign Secretary,immediately one was received.The question then arose what reply, if any, shouldbe sent to the telegram from Moscow.      It wassuggested that the Russians should be told that wewere already   carrying out operations from Italy, thatwe had asked the Americans to undertake a shuttleoperation from this country, and that we hoped that theRussians would be able to take their share in helping the Poles.

The1 War Cabinet -(1) Endorsed the opinion of the Air staff that a large scale operation by Bomber&apos;Command to assist the Poles in Warsawwould be militarily unjustifiable&apos;;    and invited the Foreign Secretary to informthe Polish Government accordingly.(2) Took note that the.Vice Chiefs of Staff had requested General Eisenhower to considerthe possibility of mounting an operation by the Eighth U.S. Air Force to drop supplies on Warsaw at the earliest possible date;and invited the Vice Chief of the Air staff to inform the Foreign Secretary as soon asa reply was received.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform thePrime Minister of the&apos; views of the WarCabinet, and of the action taken withGeneral Eisenhower.(k) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform theRussian Government of what we were doing,in order to enable them to take their share in bringing aid to Warsaw.ces of the War Cabiaet, S.W.1.
