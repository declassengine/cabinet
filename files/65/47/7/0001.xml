MINUTE confidential Annex(9th August, 1944 - 5.30 p.m.)The War Cabinet had before them a memorandumby the -Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(W.P. (44) 433) on the question of sending Britishtroops into Greece immediately the Germanewithdrew.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs drew attention to the political importance ofmaintaining our position in Greece and of avoiding a coup d&apos;etat by E.A.M. immediately the Germanswithdrew.     Were E.A.M., who were strongly armed,to seize power., a civil war or massacre might follow.     That would he very injurious to our prestige.     Furthermore, given Russian relationswith E.A.M., it might add Greece to the postwarBalkan Slav bloc which now showed signs of formingunder Russian influence and from which we were anxious to keep Greece detached.     He recognised thedifficulty of making troops available in the nearfuture, should the Germans withdraw from Greece,and the difficulty also of deciding the size of theforce to he sent in.     But he felt that the case for despatching a force (to be based in the mainon Athens, and with perhaps a smaller force inSalonika) was very strong.     There was, of course,no question of our forcing any particular form ofgovernment on the Greeks or interfering with theirabsolute liberty to choose the system under whichthey would iti future live.     Nor were we in any way committed as regards the position of the King.     Butit was important to keep law and order until thegovernment had found its feet, and we were alsounder obligation to ensure the effective distri-hution of relief.     He suggested that, apart from thedespatch of British troops immediately the Germanswithdrew, there was much to be said for addingsay 200 (officers and other ranks) to the small force under Colonel Woodhouse&apos;s orders in Greece,-without waiting for a German withdrawal.     The Britishliaison officers in.Greece, and the small numberof British troops with them, exercised considerable influence.If it was decided to despatch troops to Greeceimmediately after a German withdrawal,-he would propose to let the United States Government knowour intentions, but would not propose to say anything at this stage to the Russians,-1-

T2IE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFagreed that it was important from the military asweir as the political point of view to maintain a friendly Greece.     The Chiefs of Staff feared, however that a force of 10,000 men, such as had been suggestedN might prove insufficient.. &apos;  If, for example, thesituation deteriorated and there was a question of holding, a controlled plebiscite, a force vOf up to 80,000men might be required.     This would be particularlyawkward if the Germans started to withdraw now,       -since at the present time any troops required forGreece could only be found at the expense of Italy.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff saidthat he had already been in -consultation with themilitary authorities&apos;In the Middle East on the matter.It had been contemplated that part of a division which had been sent back from Italy and was howrecuperating in Palestine, should be earmarked for despatch .to Greece.      This Division would, hov/ever,probably be required in Italy again   at a later date.    -An alternative scheme was now being worked out to build up a special force in the Mediterranean,by adding to a Brigade Headquarters a number ofA.A. troops and other units now in the Middle Eastwho we3?e now In process of being retrained asinfantry.      He recommended that this latter scheme should be adopted.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that he thoughtthat arrangements could be made to send two squadrons to Greece, with the possibility of a &quot;third salonika.&apos;.   This force of two or three effectivesquadrons could perhaps be supplemented by, say, 50or 60 aircraft from O..T.Us. which would make a show.As regards the Navy, it was suggested, that itcould be arranged for such ships as were available toshow the flag.THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER thought that it mightbe possible to arrange that the British troops sent .t&quot;oGreece after the German withdrawal were despatched,ostensibly at any rate,.in connection with thearrangements for relief.      If this were done, therewould be much less risk of our becoming involved in political disputes in Greece. &apos;THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE DOMINIONSsuggested that just as we were anxious to ensurethat E.A.M, should not be able to control the plebiscite,- so there was much to be said for the Kingstanding aside and not returning to Greece until the&apos;plebiscite had taken place.     His position might wellbe strengthened were he to stand aside and remain inthis country until the position v/as clearer.There was, general agreement that the immediate despatch of a force on the lines proposed - ostensiblyin connection with relief arrangements - afforded &quot;&apos;the best chance of enabling a stable Government tobe established in accordance with the wishes of theGreek people, withoi.it our becoming unduly involved inGreek internal affairs.

The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows -(1) Steps should be taken, forthwith to increasem--:.ii; the number of British troops now in Greeceunder Colonel Woodhouse&apos;s orders by, say..200 all ranks.(2) General agreement was expressed with theproposals made by the Chiefs of Staff as tothe size of the force which should beprepared for immediate despatch to Greece&apos;in the event of a German withdrawal,&apos; viz -(a) the. special force of 10,000 men nowbeing organised in the Middle East onthe lines indicated by the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff-;(b) two or possibly three regular squadrons,together with aircraft from O.T.Us.(3) These forces should be introduced intoGreece if and when the Germans withdraw,ostensibly in connection with our relief.arrangements.(h) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs -should inform the United States Government,but at the present stage should -not informthe Russian Government, of our intentionsih this matter.W     of view in the King not ^turj^TtoGreece until afte^bhe^trTicxte hadtaken place^^h^ecretary of State for foreign^Affairs should advise him thattiwrfTwould be the wiaest course and     %%Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.-3-
