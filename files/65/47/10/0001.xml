THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of........... jM^^T^r^rf^........g SECRET. Copy N0../AW.M.O4U) 110TH conclusions confidential Annex(20th August, 19hh - 5.30 p.m.)The War Cabinet at their meeting on 21st August had invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to(Previous        prepare for their consideration a draft declarationReference:       to he issued by NH.M. Government and, if possible, theW.M. (Uij.) 109th  United States Government also, to the effect that conclusions,    we recognised the Polish Underground Army as a fullyMinute 3)        combatant force entitled to normal treatment.under the laws and customs of war.They now had before them a paper by.the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (w.P.(hh) U62) containing a draft declaration.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he attached great importance to saying something that would givea degree of protection to the Polish Underground Armyfighting in Warsaw, help Polish morale, and give some satisfaction to the Polish Government in London.That Government was going through a period of greatstrain, and there was strong pressure, which m. Mikolajczyk was resisting, for a public protest against our failure to give the Underground Army more effective help.    There was some risk that any declarationmight give rise to Russian criticism.    But he did notthink that that need be taken too seriously, and thePoles were prepared to face it. - The Polish Governmenthad been pressing us officially for this declarationfor many months.    The material help we were able toprovide for Warsaw was very small.    If, in addition,we could not meet them over this, it would be a severeblow.   We had a certain responsibility to the UndergroundArmy which we had been supplying.    We&apos; must consideralso the effect of refusal at the present criticaljuncture not only on the Polish Government but on theposition of M. Mikolajjczyk personally.   He would propose to give a copy of the draft to Mr. Winant and ask if the United States would join us over it.   .In the&apos; discussion that followed the&apos; followingpoints were made -

(l)    The declaration as drafted unquestionablyrepresented the farthest we could safely go.    Even so,it was unlikely to be of any real help and encouragement to the Poles and was very likely to cause strong Russianresentment.    Could the danger of a Russian counterdeclaration be ignored?   Was it not of great importanceat the present critical juncture to avoid difficulty with Russia and to concentrate on bringing the russians and the Poles together?   If we did decide to make adeclaration ought we not to try to take the Russianswith us?(2)    It was pointed out, on the other hand, thatthe Russians had already declined to associate themselves with sixch a declaration.    Wo had .definite obligations to the Poles, and to the Polish Government.in London,which we recognised as the legitimate Government.It would be most unfortunate if because of Russianopposition we made no declaration,, the present PolishGovernment resigned and was replaced possibly by onewhich was more anti-Russian.    In particular, the lossof M. Mikolajczyk would remove the person most likely to reach an understanding with the Soviet Govern-ment.    Could we in any event be certain that a favourablemoment to approach the Russians could be expected inthe near future?(3)   There was the risk that if we consulted theUnited States the importance of the Polish vote would lead them to urge a strengthening of the declaration with would make it still more unpalatable to Russia.It was urged on the other hand that though theUnited States were not, as we were, allied with Poland,or supplying the&apos;Underground Army, the.moral effectof their support would be considerable.(h)    The suggestion was made that the position of the underground Army was not really parallel with thatof the Maquis.    It was pointed out, that even so,it was difficult to refuse assistance to our Alliesfighting in Warsaw, especially when the material assistance we could provide was so limited.(5)    It was suggested in discussion -(a) that the preamble of the draft declaration should be amended to bring out more clearly that the Polish Government were at war withGermany, and that the Home Army was one ofthe Forces fighting the Germans as a legitimateArmy;(b) that in paragraph 1, line 1 should be amended to read &quot;is properly mobilised and&quot;,and that the words &quot;operated under theorders and directions of the Polish high command and&quot; should be omitted;(c) that in paragraph 2, the words &quot;in units&quot;should be inserted after the word &quot;operate&quot;;(d) that in paragraph 38 line 1, the word &quot;any&quot;should be inserted before &quot;reprisals&quot; anda form of words substituted for the lasttwo sentences to the effect that reprisalswould be at the peril of the Germans committingthem,&quot;who would be held responsible fortheir crimes.

A copy of the draft declaration embodying the amendments provisionally accepted is appended   -to this record.After further discussion, the War Cabinet -&apos;(l) Agreed that a declaration in the general-sense proposed by the Foreign Secretary,- i    as amended in the course of discussion,should be made.(2) Invited him to consider its terms further with the Solicitor-General;    and thereafter(a) to consult the United StatesGovernment and endeavour to persuade them to join us in it;(b) to consider a further approach tothe Russian Government;(c) to report again to the War cabinet when the United States reply hadbeen received.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.

annex draft DECLARATION AS PROVISIONALLY &apos;AMENDED&quot;The Polish Government are at war with Germany.   .ThePolish Home Army is one of. the forces fighting against theGermans as a legitimate Army.    Reports have reachedH.M. Government that members of that Army are be ingtreated by the German military authorities in a manner,contrary to the laws and customs of war.H.M.
