MINUTE kConfidential   Annex(3rd July, 19hh - 5.30 p.m.)AIR RAIDS(previous reference:W.M; (i+it) 8UthGonclus ions,Minute 2)Attacks &quot;byPlyingBombsThe War Cabinet had before them -(i) A memorandum by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security (W.P.(Uh) 358)on the subject of the publication of air raid casualty figures for the month ofJune;     and(li) A memorandum by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security (W.P.(Ui).) 359)proposing that, subject to appropriatesafeguards, the Press should be permitted to indicate that London had been the target of the enemy attacks and had borne a shareof the resulting casualties and damage.In the course of discussion the following points of an operational character were raised the JOINT PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY, MINISTRY OPSUPPLY, said that it would be unwise-to assume thatthe attacks could he mastered in a matter of weeks.There was evidence that the enemy had launched the new .weapon sooner that he had planned, and it-was reasonable to expect that (apart from the effect of counter measures)he would be able to increase the scale of his attacks overthe next few weeks.      If we maintained an active offensive against his factories, supply depots and launching siteswe might be able to keep the numbers of &quot;bombs launched downto about the present average, but more than this could notat present he expected.With regard to our defences the present position was that oh an average we were ahle to destroy Wi% of the bombs launched and it might be that, as improvements weremade in the equipment of our aircraft and guns and as theskill of the pilots and gunners increased, we should he ableto bring up the average to 50% in the next few weeks.i Taking everything into account he. thought thatwe might reduce the weight of explosives dropped in london from 50 tons to 30 tons a day;   hut we ought to he preparedto face attacks on this scale for several months.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that he agreed with the appreciation of the situation given by the joint parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Supply.     He pointed outthat the attacks on ski sites v/hich the R.A.P. had carriedout over a long period had undoubtedly postpoaed the attacks and reduced their scale.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that this informationshowed that the attacks must &quot;be treated as a serious and continuing threat against which, subject to the over-riding needs of the Battle of France, all our available resources must &quot;be used.     Every effort must &quot;be made toimprove&apos; our defences, and he had no doubt that the AirMinistry would seek to improve the performance of thefighters employed against the flying &quot;bombs and would consider improvements in the &quot;balloon &quot;barrage, (e.g.by raising the height of the &quot;&quot;barrage or by strengthening the cables).     It might be desirable for the anti-aircraft -batteries to fire marker bursts in front of flying bombs,in order to give an indication of the direction in whichthey were travelling.- It was also necessary to consider whethercounter measures should not be used against Germany inview of the deliberate use of thisveapon of an indis-criminate character.It was for consideration whether we shouldnot publish a list of,, say, 100 of the smaller towns inGermany, where the defences were likely to be weak, andannounce our, intention of destroying them ,one by one by bombing attacks.    ,It would, of course, be necessary to take account of the extent to which a policy of this kind would divert our air power from the support of our allies in France and from targets, such as oil installations,factories, depots, flying bomb sites, attacks on whichdirectly crippled the enemy1s general war effort or his power to launch flying bomb attacks.     There would also have to be some consultation with the United States and soviet Governments before such a policy was adopted.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR pointed out that already 50 per cent, of our air strength&apos;was being usedto counter the flying bomb attacks and that it would be extremely difficult to spare additional resources fromthe Battle of France. v  Again, the threats made by theenemy in connection with our attacks on Berlin showed that there was a grave risk that attacks of the kindindicated by the Prime Minister would lead to reprisalsin the form of the shooting of any air crews who fell into german hands.There was general agreement that the question raised by the Prime Minister should be considered^Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.
