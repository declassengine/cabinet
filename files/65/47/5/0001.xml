Mikolajczyk were to ask to visit Russia hewould receive a sympathetic&apos; reply.     An answer from premier stalin, dated 23rd July, had now been received.      It was tothe effect that events on the Polish front were proceedingvery rapidly, that the question of administration of Polishterritory had now arisen in a practical form, and that it huOtherefore been considered necessary to establish contact -&quot;withthe Polish Committee of National Liberation which intended toundertake the setting up of administration on Polish territory.No alternative forces which could do so had been found in poland.     Russia had no desire to have, and would not set up,her administration on the territory of Poland, for she did not wish to interfere in the internal affairs of Poland.     she could not consider the Polish Committee as the Government ofPoland, but it was possible that in due course it would serve as a nucleus for the formation of a Provisional PolishGovernment out of democratic forces.     As regardsM. Mikolajczyk he would not, of course, refuse to receive him.It would, however, be better if M. Mikolajczyk were to addresshimself to the Polish National Committee whose attitude wouldbe friendly towards him.Discussion followed as to what advice should be givento M. Mikolajczyk in the light of this telegram.THE PRIME MINISTER was strongly of opinion thatM. Mikolajczyk should see Premier Stalin without delaywithout any barrier to his thereafter making contact with thePolish Committee of National Liberation,     The Poles whowere now co-operating with the Russians were neither Quislingsnor Communists.     At the pace at which the campaign was going,the Russians might very soon be in Warsaw, and every day&apos;sdelay thus strengthened the position of the local Poles, and placed the Polish Government in London at a greater dis-advantage if no contact was established.      If contact v/as not made now, the alternative government, with Russian backing,would be well in the saddle when the peace settlement wasreached and would claim with some plausibility to be representative of Poland.The War Cabinet was informed that certain PolishGenerals, who had just been brought over from Poland, had0 stated that the leaders of the Polish Home Army, who had been heavily engaged in fighting the Germans and supporting theRussian advance, had been arrested and thrown into prisonby the Russians.-1-

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he felt that if this waso,- it only made it all the more important thatM. Mikolajczyk should make early contact with the Russian.Government, and he hoped that the Foreign Secretary wouldtake an early opportunity of persuading M. Mikolajczykto take advantage of Premier Stalin&apos;s attitude.The War Cabinet expressed general agreement withthe view of the Prime Minister.Discussion followed as to the terms of the approach to be made by the Foreign Secretary to M. Mikolajczyk,and whether he should be shown Premier Stalin&apos;s telegram,THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that it would be preferable that Premier Stalin&apos;s telegram should not becommunicated either wholly or in part to M. Mikolajczyk,-The Foreign Secretary should see him and give him in his&quot;own words the information that Premier Stalin had indicate^that he would not, of course, refuse to receive himthough it would be better if he were to address himself to the Polish National Committee, whose attitude would befriendly towards himi     The Foreign Secretary should urgeM. Mikolajczyk most strongly to go, and his journey shouldbe facilitated in every way.     Even if, when he reachedMoscow, his conversations with Premier Stalin did not gowell, or he was unable to reach an understanding with,the Polish Committee of National Liberation, the PrimeMinister thought that the Russians Could be relied on tosend him safely back to this country.The War Cabinet -Expressed full agreement with the coursesuggested by the Prime Minister^ and invited the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs to proceed accordingly.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1
