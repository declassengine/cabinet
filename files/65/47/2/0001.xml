THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat as the War Cabinet were aware we had asked Turkey(Previous to break off relations with Germany.   The TurkishReference: Government had now said that they were willing to breakW.M. (Uh) 65th off diplomatic and economic relations with GermanyConclusions, at any moment H.M. Government recommended, subject to minute 2) four days&apos; notice.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat there was some reason to think that Turkey mighthave been willing to enter the war outright.   Therewere, however, certain advantages in Turkey breakingoff relations instead of declaring war.   These were -(a) That relations could be broken off at oncewithout delay.    (It was clear that if t/owere now to ask Turkey to go to war withGermany, this would involve long discussionse,g. about supply of war material.)(b) That this would not involve us in military commitments.(c) That it would produce nearly the same moral effect on Germany.There was the possibility that the severance&apos; of relations between Turkey and Germany might lead to a situation in which Turkey would get involved in war evenif we did not press for this.    The Turks had therefore asked for certain assurances which they suggested shouldbe embodied in an exchange of letters.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the drafts submitted by the Turkish Government forthis purpose went much too far and were not acceptable.He proposed therefore instead to give the followingverbal assurances -(a) That within the limits of their materialpossibilities, H.M. Government would afford the Turkish Government all theassistance necessary to mitigate the economicdisturbances which might result from the severance of relations with Germany.

(b) That if. hostilities-&quot; with .Turkey followed- &apos;;      /    the breaking off of relations wo would end her. all the assistance, economic and.   tlilitary,, in our power, and that the.nature of this assistance would, he thesubject of conversations as and when necessary.(c) That we would use our good offices with theAllies to obtain for Turkey assistancesimilar to that which We ourselves undertook to afford.   -The Turks were very anxious to claim that their actionin breaking off relations with Germany was sufficientto re-establish: the Treaty of .1939 in full force.   Thiswould not be altogether to our advantage since Turkeyhad hitherto failed to discharge her obligations to usin full.under the Treaty:   We proposed therefore to takethe line that the breaking off of relations with germany would come within the framework of the Alliance.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs addedthat the Russians were unlikely to regard the breaking&apos;of relations, as going far enough.   They might well prefer a declaration.of war or nothing.   It would, of course,be necessary to communicate with the United States and soviet Governments,       He added that the chiefs ofStaff weifo being informed of these proposals and their observations would bo sought before action was taken.THE PRIME MINISTER welcomed the news of the Turkishdecision;   Its effect on Germany, as well as generally,coming this moment, might be very groat.   He thought it important not to risk failure over the question whether our assurances to the Turks should be written or verbal.As regards the Russian attitude, he thought we could resonably take the line that there was no harm in havingtwo bites at the cherry.THB SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he agreed that the assurances which he had mentionedshould, if necessary, be given in writing.   He thought,however, that we should not go beyond them and we should not give the fuller assurances which the Turks had been anxious to secure, e,g. as regards the cession of islands in the Dodecanese; the construction of a pipe-line, etc.The War Cabinet - ;&quot;  &apos;-&apos;        Took note with satisfaction of the Secretaryofi-State for Foreign Affairs&apos; report, and approved the course of action recommendedby him*Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W.I.7th July, 19kk

Despite some hard and disappointing?-periods,statement by        the forces under General Alexander&apos;s Command hadGeneral Alexander not only captured Rome, hut they had taken a great many prisoners.       As a result of their efforts, atleast IS German divisions had been practically dis-integrated, and the retreating Germans were beingvigorously pursued.     He was sure that they wouldlike to hear General Alexander&apos;s account of the campaign to date, and his views as to what shouldbe done in Italy in the future,GENERAL ALEXANDER said that the battle for italy, which, was now in full swing   and mightalmost be said to be reaching its climax, had started with the landing of the 8th Army on the toeof Italy, and of the 5th Army at Salerno.By the end of the summer of 1945, the landingsfet Salerno and Taranto had been effected; Napleshad been captured, and our forces were marching onRome,     At this moment, Hitler stepped in andordered his forces to hold at all costs the linesouth of Rome,     Our forces in Italy were weakenedby having to give up 7 experienced divisions, anumber of landing craft and considerable air forces required for &quot;OVERLORD&quot;,At the beginning of the winter, the advanceof our weakened forces was slowed up by thedetermined resistance of the enemy   in     difficultcountry   well suited for defence, and hy bad weather.The directive issued to him for the winter campaignhad h.eeii to engage the enemy wherever and whenever possible,and to destroy as many of his forces as he could.The two high lights of the winter campaign were.the landing at Anzio and the attack on Cassino,The object of the Anzio landing had been tosecure a bridgehead, and to cut communications betweenRome and Cassino, in the hopes of inducing theenemy to withdraw from his winter line, or so to weaken that line by withdrawing forces to opposeour landing, that our advancing troops would be afforded an opportunity to break through.     two divisions had &quot;been landed almost without opposition, a third division&apos;had followed some two days later.

It had been suggested that if greater risks hadbeen taken, and dperafciohs carried out more vigorously,our forces might have advanced further than they didoThis might be the case, but he himself doubted if itwould have been possible to advance much further than we did.The enemy reaction to our landing was rapid,but had not taken the form we had hoped.     He had brought down 10 divisions from further north in Italy, and hadsealed in our divisions in the bridgehead.At the time, it was arguable if the Anzio landing was worth while*     Its value was proved in the Spring,when the possession Of the bridgehead had given him a twohanded punch*Many had wondered why he had persisted inhammering at Cassinoe     A glance at the map showed thatthere was no possibility of breaking through in themountainous country to the north east of the town.   The onlyarea where he could employ and deploy his greatsuperiority in artillery and tanks was the Liri Valley,running from Cassiho to Rome4     He could not get intothe Valley until Cassino, which formed a great bastionastride the only road into it had been capturedc; The fpposiiig land forces were approximately equal *   each   side having some 19 divisions *     We hada great superiority in tanks and gun power, and an almost overwhelming superiority in the air     The enemy had the advantage of ground, and his army was homogeneous,whereas ours was composed of a large number of nationalitiesincluding as it did, Americans, Poles, French, Italians,Indians and even Japanese elements, in addition toBritish and Dominions troops.He had been anxious to capture Cassino beforelaunching his Spring offensive, and had tried the experiment, which had very nearly succeeded, of crushingresistance in the town  by a devastating air attack,quickly followed up by ground forces.     This attackfailed   for three, reasons.     Firstly, the number of cavesand deep cellars, which provided shelter for the garrison;secondly, the fact that the bombardment had caused so many craters and so much general devastation, that our forces could not advance through it, and it was only possible   to infiltrate slowly with infantry; and thirdly,the magnificent fighting qualities of the welldisciplined and fanatical German parachutists defendingthe town.     Despite our failure to capture the town,we, gained some commanding ground, and  a    small bridge-head *ver the Raptdo^    which played an important partin the subsequent operations resulting in the capture*f Cassino.

The directive issued to him.for the Spring offensive,had&quot;been to launeh the maximum possibie^weight of attack, with aview to destroying the enemy, and forcing him to bringnew formations into the battle,, thereby assisting&quot;OVERLORD&quot;*     The timing of his offensive was dependenton the date of &quot;OVERLORD&quot;, and was of the greatest importance.     His experience had shown that in any large set-piece attack, one could expect to have tofight for some two to three weeks before obtaining adecision,     Alamein and the Mareth line had each takensome 11 daysj Tunis had taken 3 weeks, and Salernoa fortnight.     It had also been necessary to consider how long it would take to get Romei     He had allowed for an advance at ihe rate Of 4 miles per day,In the even this calculations&apos; proved to be 24 hours out.     Fortunately j&quot;OVERLORD&quot; was postponed 24 houfrsj and Rome had been capturedjust in time.)He planned tb make his main thrust up the Liri -&apos;Valley, assisted by a &quot;break-out from the Anzio &quot;bridge-head,   tee. had to decide which attack should be launchedfirst4     As all the indications showed that the Germansexpected the first blow to come from the bridgehead,and as we had massed some 15 divisions, supported &quot;bytanks and artillery, a force which would almost certainly be sufficient to break through the Germanpositions, against the Liri Valley, he decided that thisshould be the area for the first attack.The attack was launched in the shape of an arrow.The 8th Army were in the centre, the Poles on the right, andthe French and Americans on the left:     all three\ converging, on Frosinone.     Our advance was assisted &quot;bythe enemy&apos;s failure to spot our regrouping for the attack, with the result that he underestimated the speed of our advance, arid we had over-run the Adolf   Hitler line&quot;before it was manned,&apos;        This attack succeeded indrawing t f some of tne 10 enemy divisions opposing the 7 we now had in the Anzio bridgehead.The timing of the Anzio attack also gave rise to -considerable difficulties.     The bridgehead area was flat,and was overlooked by the enemy from the hills surroundingit.     All troop movements preparatory to the attack had therefore to be made &quot;by night, and three days warninghad to be given &quot;before an attack could be launched.The night &quot;before We attacked, the enemy withdrewtwo Important battle groups from the line.     As  was now known, the attack was very successful.   The euemyrapidly withdrew from the coast, thus enabling our main force to link up with the bridgehead.     Since thatdate, the operations had   been in the nature of aprocession.

It had been his aim to cut off as many of&apos;theGerman forces as possible. &apos;       It was extremely difficultto cut off forces, particularly if they were mechanised.,w Nevertheless we had captured some, 35,000 prisoners, andO he estimated that the enemies total losses were of theorder of 100,000. This   was double our losses.     TheItalian roads were littered with the wreckage of guns,trucks;and tanks*     The enemy divisions which had beenopposing our forces south of Rome had been severelymauled,    and the enemy had been forced to bring fresh divisions into the theatre.There had been 19 enemy divisions south of Romewhen we attacked; there were now 37 German divisionssouth of the Apennines.     He estimated that these were* -the equivalent of only 12 full strength divisions.     Wehad 19 divisions, all of which were up to strength.Our advance had&apos;been slowed up considerably by thedifficulties experienced in bringing our railheadforward in pace with our-advance.     A new railheadwas due to be opened that day at Orte near term , previouslyit had been at Roccaseoca, some 200 miles behind our frontline.In his retreat, the enemy had destroyed thebridges, and had also mined the tracks.     The Engineershad done great work in restoring the railways to theextent they had.     Similar difficulties had been experienced on the coast, where a great deal of working   had been required to restore the ports of Civita Vecchia,nortB&apos;wo(   San Stefano and /Pimbino, through which the american forces were supplied.     He had hitherto been able to employ only 9 of the 19 divisions available, but as the/      railhead was brought forward,/** feffl? would be able to employ more.The Pisa/Rimini line, which the enemy was now preparing to hold.  : was some 180 miles long.    It was strongeston the flanks but there were defensive works scatteredthroughout its length;   It was not a deep position. *He considered that the enemy would have to keep atleast one division on each flank and one in Istria. Unless,    the enemy sent more divisions to the area, he would%t^/\*4uaJ* have only some 11 di vi sions^wjaft,,tin *wh,iTre to hold the remainder of-the line. This was not enough and we should not thereforeexperience any great difficulty in piercing it. His aim wouldbe tobreak through into the valley of the Po, thus splittingKesselring&apos;s armies in half, and to establish bridgeheadsover the Po from which operations could be launched in any direction which might subsequently be decided upon.     His forces had recently been weakened byinevitable withdrawals for other operations.   Everyeffort was, however, being made to make up for thesewithdrawals as far as possible.   Personally, he wouldlike to be given a free hand to re-form and re-equip&apos;  up to a total of 3 Italian divisions and to employ someat least of these forces as fighting units.   Goodmaterial was available and experience had shown that theI Italians mixed and fought well with the Polish forces with which they had much in common.   He thought that provided selected British or perhaps Polish liaison officers were attached to Italian formations, thelatter would prove their value.

He thought it most important that a senior Americancomnssacfea? should be retained in Italy.&apos; His idea was to- continuethe sub-division of his forces into two armies, one under aBritish and the other under an American Commander.    In vie:?ofvthe withdrawal of considerable American forces, it might benecessary to strengthen the American army by allotting to it aBritish Corps,    This he was prepared to do.    It was important to remember that we were to a large extent dependent on the americans for the provision of special equipment and certain services, particularly salvage and engineer services.When we reached the Po &quot;Valley, he thought we should establish control over the quadrilateral   Padua/Verona/Parma/Bologna.    This would give -us the virtual control of Italy.Once we had established this control,&quot; we could advance eitherwestwards towards the South of Prance or north-eastwards throughthe Ljubljana Gap towards the Danube Valley.    There was nodoubt in his mind as to which course we should follow.    It wasa long way to the South of Prance, the Alps were more difficultto cross in the west than in the east, and even if we succeeded in reaching the South of Prance it.was difficult to see what our next step would be.    On the other hand, an advance north-eastwards through the historical entry into Europe, wouldthreaten the whole   of the enemy&apos;s &quot;position in the Balkans andwe should be approaching the advancing Russians, who would almost certainly shortly develop a thrust towards Lembarg andpossibly through or round the Carpathians.    Once we reached the danube Valley, the enemy would be forced to abandon his positionin the Balkans, which would result in his satellites in that theatre dropping out of the- wars    It. would also open possibilitiesof a march to Vienna,He estimated that if the enemy were to have a reasonable chance of stopping our advance north-eastward, he must bring inat least 15 fresh divisions, which could be found only at theexpense of the Russian front or of the forces opposing&quot;OVERLORD&quot;.    If the enemy Drought.in these forces, he(General Alexander) would not guarantee that he could breakthrough the Ljubljana Gap.    But either way, operations in that direction would pay a good dividend.    If he -succeeded inbreaking through, he threatemed the whole enemy position inthe Balkans.    If he did not succeed, it would be because theenemy had diverted large forces from other fr-onts, thusassisting the Allied forces engaged on those fronts.    the stronger the forces which were put at his disposal, thegreater would be the dividend to be derived from their operations.THE PRIME MINISTER said that General Alexander had had to release 7 divisions for &quot;OVERLORD&quot; and   had now been calledupon to release 7 more, 3 American and 4 French, for .&quot;ANVIL&quot;.       General de Gaulle&apos;s anxiety to send french troops to join up with the Maquis&apos;in Southern Prance wasunderstandable, and we had been unable to resist the pressure of the Americans as regards the withdrawal of these forces andof 3 American divisions.      If &quot;ANVIL&quot; was unable to make progress,    it was possible that we should   be   pressed to agree to   the withdrawal   of further   American

rorces to sustain this operation,,    Nevertheless, hethought it was important that when General Alexanderreturned to Italy? he should know exaetly what forces would he available to him for future operations in that    -theatre, and should he assured that these would not heweakened hy further withdrawalso   Unless some suchassurance was forthcoming., there was a danger thatany plans he might make would he nullified hy the removalof some of the forces on which they dependedo   He thought&quot;that there was a good chance of reaching an understanding with the President and the American Chiefs of Staff inthis matter, though,Of course, in war any such understandingmust he open to-review in the light of any emergencywhich might arise in the future0He himself was very much in favoxir of the strategy .recommended hy General Alexander.
