(kk) 11hthConclusions.Minute k)The War Cabinet had before them the following memoranda on the future of 3.-0.A. C. :-(i) two memoranda by the Secretary of State forAir* W.P. (kl+O 268 and 529;(ii) a memorandum by the Secretary of State forIndia, W..P. (kk) 498;(iii) a memorandum by the Minister of aircraft production, W.P.(UU) 508.They also had before them the following memoranda on the private ownership of British airlines:-(iv) a memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal,(W.P.(hh) 263 (Revise);(v) a memorandum by the Secretary of State forAir, W.P.(kk) 279.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that adecision on the Government&apos; s policy towards B.0wl.. C.was urgently needed in view of the impending talks at ottawa on the co-ordination of Empire air services,and of the International Civil .-ar Transportconference to be held in November.     Moreover, ifplans were not laid and commitments entered into now,British civil aviation would be unable to start on equal terms with its competitors.     He accordingly recommended that a decision should now be taken thatafter the war all British overseas air services,whether subsidised or not,  should be the responsibilityof B. O.A. C.The question whether B.0.A.C. would directlyoperate all our overseas services might be left openso that the War Cabinet might examine in greater detail what would be the best arrangement for theactual operation of services on particular routes.At the Empire talks we should have to makeplans&apos; for the co-ordination of Empire air services with the Dominion Governments who themselves hadentrusted the responsibility for their overseas services to state-owned agencies similar to B.O.A.C.It -would be very much easier to reach agreement if.O.A. C. were our agent.

Again, we had boon forced to concentrate our production during the war on aircraft of operationaltypes, leaving it to the United States to provide us with transport aircraft.     The development.of british types of transport aircraft would inevitably take a -considerable time.      Our handicaps-would be verymuch less if we knew that the customer for the aircraft to be produced would be B.O.A.C.   .    If the developmentof overseas air routes were left, to private companies,they might seek to obtain the necessary aircraft fromthe United States.It was some time now since the Lord Privy Sealhad invited the shipping and railway companies tobring forward their proposals for civil air transport and we could no longer delay a decision,.&apos;  THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had beeninformed that there was a very strong feeling in theConservative and Unionist Members Committee in favourof an&apos;immediate separation of civil aviation fromthe Air Ministry arid that dissatisfaction had been expressed with the proposal that, pending the transferof responsibility for civil aviation from the AirMinistry to the Ministry of Transport, anadditional Parliamentary Under-Secretary of state should be created in order to deal exclusively with civil aviation.      In those circumstances it might benecessary to give the Minister who was to beresponsible for civil aviation a higher status, andpossibly a degree of independence similar to thatof the Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade.Although there were strong reasons in favourof an early decision on the future of B.O.*i. C,  itmight be fairer to do so when the new Minister hadbeen appointed, and could take part in theconsideration of the question.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that theproposal made by the Secretary of State for Airinvolved a definite change in the position of B.O.A.C.Under the Act of 19*39 subsidies from the exchequer in respect of British overseas air routes werepayable only to B.0.A.C.     But the Secretary ofState for Air now proposed that all British overseasair services, whether subsidised or not, should bethe responsibility of B.O.A. C.      Although theCanadian and South African G-governments had entrustedtheir overseas air services to state-owned agenciesthe Australian agency was only partly state-ownedand the United States overseas services were run by private companies.      While he was not averse to some form of compromise between state-ownership and private enterprise he felt that it was essential toreach agreement on proposals which would leaveprivate enterprise with sufficient fxveedom.      Thiswas of particular importance from the point of viewof the production of aircraft,THE 3ECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA said that hewould not object to. a solution which made B.O.A. C.responsible for developing certain special Empireroutes (e.g. the fast service to Australia and NewZealand), but that the development of other routesmust be left to private enterprise.

He was satisfied that Parliament would not accept any solution which left the planning of post-war civil aviation with the Air Ministry.Q THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL service said that the issue needed careful handling, since it aroused acute political controversy.     As againstthe arguments advanced in the memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (W.P.(hh) h.98), itcould be urged that if,.as was inevitable, theState had to subsidise civil aviation by theprovision of such things as research services,landing grounds, meteorological services, it wasnot fair that private companies should have theadvantage of developing the profitable routes,,leaving the tanprofitable services to be run bythe Government.      The past record of the shipping and railway companies was not such as to encourage the belief that they would be the ideal agents for-the development of civil aviation.&apos;    On the otherhand, he realised that there must be an all partysettlement and he was prepared for a compromise solution so long as he could be satisfied that it did not prejudice the interests of the country asa whole in securing a strong civil aviationIndustry0     He hoped that the term &quot;choseninstrument&quot;, which was vague and provocative, wouldbe avoided in any public discussion.After further discussion the War cabinet agreed to resume consideration of the questions raised in the memoranda at an early date.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.
