Hesaid that agreement had been reached on the conductof the war against Japan, and the Americans had accepted our offer of the British fleet to operate in the main operations against Japan in the Pacific.Agreement.had also been reached on the operations tobe carried.out in.Burma,  and the Americans had agreedto furnish the additional resources we required,though there was still some doubt&quot;about whether theywould be able to find the two American Divisions forwhich;we had asked.      General Marshall was examining the matter, and had promised to do his best.A satisfactory agreement had been reachedabout the zones of occupation of Germany.     We wouldhave the North West zone and the Rhineland west ofthe Rhine:    the Americans would have the South Westzone, but would be given control of Bremen andBremerhaven.     The First Sea Lord and Admiral king had come to ah understanding about the Navalarrangements in the North Western zone.      SHAEF.would disappear when hostilities ceased, and an independentBritish Commander Would be in charge of the british zone.     The participation of the French In theoccupation of Germany had not been discussed,  but it seemed probable that the French would share in theoccupation of the British zone.      The President&apos;attitude towards the French National Committee of liberation was still somewhat uncompromising, and hewas not yet prepared to recognise the Committee asthe provisional Government.The discussions on American assistance in stage II had been much more satisfactory than hadbeen expected.     The Americans had put forward&apos;theproposal for the elimination of the Ruhr and the Saarindustries, and the Prime liinistor had approved thissuggestion, which certainly easod the progress of thegeneral discussions.     The American plan would needdetailed examination in London. &quot;     - &apos;m .        THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER thought that.the outcome of the Quebec Conference was a matter for great satisfaction, and he felt sure that the War cabinet would wish to convey their congratulations to the PrimeMinister.This proposal met with general approval.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W,  1.

It was mostimportant, however,  that: M. Mikolajcsyk should nowreturn to Moscow for further consultations;    but before this visit could take place, it was essentialthat General 8osnkowski should resign.
