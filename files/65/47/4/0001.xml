MINUTE confidential Annex(17th July, 19I4J4. - 5.30 p*m.)TURKEY(previous reference:W.M.(hh) 89thConclusions,Minute 3).-THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet a personal telegram from Premier Stalin dated 15th july to the effect that he saw no benefit for the allies in a mere breach of diplomatic and economic relationsbetween Turkey and Germany;    and that in view of theevasive and vague attitude of the Turkish government it would be better to leave her   in peace and not to exert fresh pressure upon here     That would, of course,mean that the claims of Turkey, who had evaded war withGermany, to special rights in post-war matters, wouldalso lapse.      The Prime Minister observed that theTurks had behaved with great unwisdom end ran the riskof missing their market.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed with the Prime Minister.     The question was how best to handle this situation.     Our plan, under whichTurkey would have severed economic and diplomatic relations, after which the situation would have been further reviewed, would have been the best?    but he doubted if it was any longer practicable.     It was clear that Russia would not co-operate on such a basis.She might indeed be aware that Turkey was ready toenter the war, and might feel that she would have done so were it not for our readiness to accept an intermediate solution.     At the point matters had reached, he now felt that there was nothing for it but to tell Turkey that her   only hope was to declare war on Germany.     If, however, Turkey did come intothe war, the risk of German bombing of Istanbul was clearly greater than if she merely broke off relations.What reassurance could we give to Turkey and what assistance?     We should not underrate the effect on germany, and possibly on Roumania, of a declarationof war by Turkey.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF referred to thedifficulties in making fighter squadrons etc, availableto the Turks   for tho protection of Istanbul.     Wewere faced with very heavy demands of an urgentcharacter in all theatres.     The risk of leaving theNorth African, ports insufficiently protected could notbe overlooked.     It was doubtful, too, whether?   evenif we made a small contribution to Turkish air defence,we should be able to deter the Germans from attackingIstanbul, or at least from making one heavy attack on it.

&quot; -THE.PRIME MINISTER felt that the importance of bringing Turkey into the war might well be so great/that we might have to face the disadvantages involvedin diverting forces from elsewhere.     There was, ofcourse, no question of helping Turkey on the HARDIHOODscale - she had missed that opportunity - but.a veryQ small contribution might produce results out of all proportion.     He suggested that the matter should befurther considered in the Defence Committee-in thelight of the discussion. -The War Cabinet -Approved the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion,.Staff Talks THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF pointedwith Turkey out that the staff talks which it was proposed tooffer the Turks In connection with a breach of relations with Germany came at a very awkward momentfrom our point of view.     Our difficulties in offeringmaterial were, at this stage, great.     If we couldpostpone the talks, say, for a month, and avoid/ disclosing in the meantime precisely what our intentions and resources were, it would be of great assistance.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSsaw no difficulty in playing for delay over Stafftalks, as suggested by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.The War Cabinet -Took note of the views expressed by theSecretary of State for Foreign AffairsoOffices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
