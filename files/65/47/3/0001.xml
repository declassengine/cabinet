ATHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT      JThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of........*2&amp;t&amp;^*f................Copy No...ix.....TOPsamrsECRET.TURKEY(previous reference;W.M.-(U4) 88thConclusions,Minute 3)W.M.(kh) 89TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE confidential Annex(10th July, l9L\h - 5,30 p,m,)THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had told the War Cabinet at their meeting on 7th July (W.M.(kk) 88th Conclusions, Minute 3) thatthe Russians were unlikely to regard the breakingoff hy Turkey of diplomatic and economic relationswith Germany as going far enough, and might stillprefer a declaration of war or nothing.     He had nowdiscussed the position with M. Gusev, and he had also had the comments of the Chiefs of Staff.      TheChiefs of Staff were uneasy as to the possiblereaction on other operations of our having to supportTurkey in the event of war between Turkey andGermany.     M. Gusev had, as he anticipated, expressed his dissatisfaction with the limited nature of theTurkish decision and had strongly pressed that nothing short Of a declaration of war would meet thecase.     M. Gusev had not, however, been at all clearas to what action Russia would be prepared to take in support of Turkey in that event, or as to whatpolicy she wished her to adopt on specific points,e.g. against Bulgaria.     He (the Foreign Secretary)had strongly urged on him that,  in our judgment,the right course now was to invite Turkey to break off relations with Germany forthwith.-    The nextstep -could he discussed thereafter at greaterleisure between the Soviet, the United States and ourselves.      It was surely better to secure theimmediate breach of relations, with the great moral effect which it was likely to produce, than to run the risk of no action being taken by Turkey while a prolonged haggle took place as to the terms on which she would declare war against the Axis.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that the Chiefsof Staff, while fully accepting the considerable effect which the breaking off of relations by Turkey was likely to have on Germany, felt that there was a risk that the latter might respond by launching a.small-scale air attack on important towns, such asIstanbul, using obsolete aircraft.      If thathappened the Turks would undoubtedly put forward an urgent request for fighter protection, which itwould be difficult to refuse.      The effect of a sudden air attack, most probably by night, against which the Turks, who were ill-equipped technically,would have no effective protection, might be veryunhappy.      On the other hand, operational demands upon our forces in the Mediterranean area were very heavy, and the possible detriment to those operations of sparing a force for Turkey should, the Chiefs ofStaff felt, be borne in mind.      In considering apossible diversion of fighters from Egypt it shouldnot be overlooked that, even if Turkey were on our side, it would still be possible for the Axis to launch an attack, for example on Alexandria, from Crete.-1,-

THE PRIME MINISTER s^id that he wasin general agreement with the Foreign Secretary.The effect on the Balkans and in Germany of evena breach of relations by the Turks, who had beenthe faithful ally of Germany in the last war,would be very great.     There were, however, certain points which he would like   the Chiefs of staff to consider further.     The Turks had, of course,missed their opportunity, last February, but itwas an essential part of our policy to have themround the table at the settlement.      They couldnot have a precise plan on the lines of theHARDIHOOD scheme.     But there must surely be something which we could make available.     now that the Turks had come back, and were preparedto be helpful, we must consider what could bedone to assist them..The Prime Minister thought that theForeign Secretary should continue to work on theRussians and do his utmost to persuade them to. i see this problem through our eyes.     He thoughtit was quite possible that the Russians mighthave in view in the near future an advance intoRumania, which might be followed by revolutionin Rumania and Bulgaria.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that he felt certain that the wisecourse was to.continue on the lines approved bythe Cabinet.     Mi Gusev had indicated that whileRussia was not at war with Bulgaria,  relationswith that country were very tense.     As for the threat of air bombardment, while he fullyaccepted its importance, he thought that theTurks when they brought themselves to offer tobreak off diplomatic and economic relations, musthave given full weight to the possibility thatIstanbul might be bombed.   He would continue, as suggested by the Prime Minister, to try to bringthe Russians into line and&apos;to argue with themthat the course v/e advocated was the only wiseone.The War Cabinet -Approved the line recommended by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs,namely that we should work for theimmediate rupture by Turkey of diplomatic and economic relations with Germany.The Foreign Secretary was authorised todispatch the telegrams which had been drafted to give effect to this policy,subject to the concurrence of the UnitedStates and Soviet Governments *Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.
