MINUTE confidential Annex(4th September, 1944 - 12.30 p,m.)The War Cabinet were informed of the latestposition as regards the Polish Underground Army&apos;sresistance in Warsaw.     Reference was made to telegram No. 624 from our Minister to the Vaticanwhich reported the text of an appeal, dated 22ndAugust, 1944, which the Pope had received from thewomen of Yfersaw, describing the terrible situationin the Polish capital.The War Cabinet agreed that it was of theutmost importance that everything possible should bedone to help the Poles.     It was felt, however, thatthe only step which we could take which would be likelyto be effective, would be that the Prime Minister should,invite President Roosevelt to consider the matter again, with a view to the United States Air Forcesbeing authorised to carry out an air operation fordropping supplies on Warsaw, if necessary gate-crashing on Russian airfields.At the same time, it was felt that premier stalin might well not realise how deeply stirredpublic opinion was in this country about the sufferingsof Warsaw and ?/hat a shock it would be to publicopinion if the Poles fighting in Warsaw were over-whelmed by the Germans, without material help havingbeen sent to them from outside.      Moreover, the factthat the Russians had refused the use of airfields intheir occupation     for this purpose was now becomingpublicly known.      It was, therefore, felt that atelegram should be sent to Premier Stalin in the name ofthe War Cabinet, warning him of the probable effectof all this on future Anglo-Russian relations.The War Cabinet accordingly agreed:-That the Prime Minister should sendtelegrams to Premier Stalin and to president Roosevelt on the lines indicated at &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.      TheForeign Secretary undertook toprepare drafts.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.
