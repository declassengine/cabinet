allied prisoners ofWar.(previous reference:,W.M.(45)21stConclusions,Minute 5.)War Crimes.(previous reference:W.M. (45)29ihConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The War Cabinet considered a telegram from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister at Berne about Allied prisoners of war inGermany. ^The discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.2. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the LordChancellor (W.P. (45) 225) reporting the results of discussions which he and the Attorney-General had held with Judge Rosenmariand other representatives of President Roosevelt about the methods to be adopted in dealing with war criminals.In the Appendix to his Memorandum the Lord Chancellor setout certain conclusions which had been provisionally agreed inthese discussions, subject to ratification by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the United States Government. It was not proposed thatthere should be any public disclosure of these plans until after the liberation of British and American prisoners of war now in german hands. The urgency was, not to make any public statement, butto have the plans agreed in readiness for immediate action whenthe time came; and authority was sought to inform JudgeRosenman of ,the views of the War Cabinet before he, returned tothe United States.Discussion centred mainly on the proposals, outlined in para-graph 4 of the Appendix to W.P. (45) 225, for dealing with theprincipal Nazi leaders. These contemplated that the principalAllies should draw up a general &quot; document of arraignment &quot;against the leading Nazis, and that an inter-Allied judicial tribunal should be appointed to report on the truth of the arraignment afterthose arraigned had&apos;been, given an opportunity of appearing beforethe tribunal and disproving the truth of its contents. The charges would be in general terms and would be so drawn as to representthe real case which the whole world recognised to lie against the nazi leaders. If they refused to recognise the jurisdiction of thetribunal, extreme measures could be taken against them with the justification that they had been offered judicial investigation. If,on the other hand, they sought to defend themselves, the worst that could happen would be that they would make long speeches andpossibly call some witnesses; but the documentary material couldnot be gainsaid and the tribunal, acting judicially, would report their conclusions.In discussion these proposals were criticised on the ground thatthey confused political and judicial jurisdiction : the action taken against the Nazi leaders would be based neither on judicial trialnor on a political act of State, and we should get the worst of bothworlds. Objections would be raised to the plan on the ground thatit did not provide for a fair trial; and at the same time the Nazileaders would be given an opportunity to deliver long speeches injustification of their actions. When the right to appear before a judicial tribunal was once conceded, the right to counsel could notbe denied; and it was likely that delaying tactics would be adopted to spin out the proceedings to unseemly lengths. Moreover, as theresult would be a foregone conclusion, these proceedings would tendto bring judicial procedure into contempt. &apos; Finally, to put Hitleron trial in this way was bound to increase the prospect of his beingregarded as a national martyr by subsequent generations of germans. .For these reasons it was argued that it would be preferable(that the Nazi leaders should be declared world outlaws andsummarily put to death as soon as they fell into Allied hands.On the other hand, the Lord Chancellor pointed out that thismatter would not rest wholly within the jurisdiction of british governments.   For himself, he had always favoured the summary
263W.M. 43 (45).execution of the principal Nazi leaders, as a political act of StateIt was, however, clear from his discussions with Judge Rosenmanthat high authorities in the United States would be unwilling toagree that these Nazi leaders should be executed without any judicial enquiry. He also understood that Marshal Stalin favoured some form of trial. It was in these circumstances that he had putforward the compromise plan outlined in the Appendix to his memorandum, which would meet the desire of our principal Alliesfor some form of judicial enquiry without the obvious disadvantages of a full judicial trial.The Prime Minister of South Africa recalled that when he had discussed this question with the&quot; War Cabinet in November 1943(W.M. (43) 152nd Conclusions, Minute 7) he had expressed the viewthat any proposals for the summary execution of the Nazi leaderswould be open to grave objection. To shoot men without trial inthis way would set a very dangerous precedent. He still adhered tothat view. While he agreed that it was out of the question toprovide for the Nazi leaders the procedure of a full judicial trial,he thought there must be some middle course which would providea formal authority for their execution after they had been given anopportunity to make some statement in reply to the charges made against them. - -The Prime Minister suggested that a procedure might be devised on the precedent of the Bill of Attainder. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might be well advised to protect themselves by askingParliament to pass an Act of Attainder which would declare thatall the principal Nazi leaders, who would be named in the Act, had made themselves liable to the supreme penalty, and would authorisethe summary execution of such of them as came into British hands.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that Hitler, andmany other of the Nazi leaders, ranked as soldiers; and it might bepossible to treat them as such and refuse them quarter.The general view of the War Cabinet was that for the principalNazi leaders a full trial under judicial procedure was out of thequestion. At the same time, it was recognised that there would be advantages in some arrangement by which the principal AlliedGovernments would publish a formal statement of the case against these men. The general sense of the War Cabinet was, however,that there would be grave disadvantages in going further, on thelines suggested in paragraph 4 of the Appendix to W.P. (45) 225,and giving these men an opportunity of replying, before somejudicial tribunal, to the charges made against them.The War Cabinet then discussed the proposals in paragraphs1-3 of the Appendix to the Lord Chancellors Memorandum, viz : &apos;, (i) That, we should reject the proposal of the War CrimesCommission for a treaty creating an inter-Allied criminal court forthe trial of war criminals.(ii) That the appropriate tribunal for the trial of war;criminals would be a military tribunal; and that, where a warcriminal was charged with crimes against members of the forces ofmore than one Ally, the case should be dealt with by a mixedmilitary court.(iii) That a special procedure should be provided for leaders and active members of the Gestapo or the S.S., by which a mixedmilitary tribunal would be invited to find that members of thoseorganisations had engaged in a criminal conspiracy, as membersof a common enterprise of a criminal character aimed at promoting a German victory by methods of outrage, torture, &amp;c. When this general judgment had been given, any members of the Gestapo Orthe S.S. eould be charged with being a member of this criminalconspiracy and punished accordingly. ItlMl
These proposals met with the general approval of the WarCabinet The War Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the provisional conclusions set out in para-graphs 1-3 of the Appendix to W.P. (45) 225;(2) Agreed that a statement should be prepared, for transmis-sion to the United States authorities, of the objections,-as developed in the discussion, to any formal procedure for trial or judicial enquiry into the misdeeds of theprincipal Nazi leaders.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor to communicate these conclu-sions to Judge Rosenman, and to prepare for transmis-sion to the United States authorities the statementmentioned at (2) above.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,12th April, 1945.
