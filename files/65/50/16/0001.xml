The War Cabinet had before them the following memoranda on the celebration of VE-day :---W.P. (45) 269: by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security;.267 : by the Secretary pf the War Cabinet, covering a Report by the Official Committee for theCo-ordination of Departmental Action on theEnd of Hostilities in Europe.The Home Secretary said that recent discussions on thisquestion had proceeded on the basis that there would be no clear-cut ending of hostilities in Europe, but that the Allied Govern-ments would issue at an appropriate stage a declaration thatorganised resistance by Germany was at an end. There wereobvious difficulties in making such a declaration the occasion for formal celebration of the end of hostilities in Europe; and, as aresult of his examination of the administrative difficulties and inthe light of the views expressed by General Eisenhower and field-Marshal Alexander, he had thought it right to invite theWar Cabinet to reconsider the general principle of the scheme on which Departments had recently been working.In discussion the view was expressed that, if these celebrations,had to be related to an Allied declaration that organised resistanceby Germany was at an end, the form and scale of the celebrationswould have to be determined in the light of the situation as itexisted at the time of the declaration. The general view of theWar Cabinet was that it was not possible to settle in advance, atany rate at the present stage, the detailed arrangements whichmight have to be made in that event. In these circumstances the better course would be to determine the arrangements which wouldbe put into force if hostilities in Europe ended with an armistice,or a general surrender of German forces in all European theatres of war. The War Cabinet could then consider at a later stagehow those arrangements should be adapted to meet the differentsituation which would arise if celebrations had to be related to an allied declaration that organised resistance by Germany was atan end.After further discussion, the War Cabinet &apos;(1) Agreed in principle that the arrangements set out in theAppendix to this Minute would be appropriate for the: celebration of an armistice or general surrender ofGerman forces in all European theatres of war;(2) Appointed a Committee consisting of The Home Secretary (in the Chair),The Minister of Reconstruction, and    -:The Minister.of Information,to settle the details of the arrangements outlined in theAppendix, and to consider how these arrangements would haveto be modified if the celebrations were related to an Allieddeclaration that organised resistance by Germany was atan end.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.27th April, 1945.ArrangementsforCelebratingthe End ofHostilitiesin Europe.(previous reference erenees:W.M.(45)41stConclusions,Minute 6,and 42ndConclusions,Minute 5.)
