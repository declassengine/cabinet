Building.registration of building workers.1. The War Cabinet *eonsidered a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service. (W.P. (45) 276) proposing a special registration of building trade workers.The Minister of Labour and National Service explained thatthe plans for expanding the labour force of the building industryassumed that more than 200,000 building workers would return to building from munitions and other industries within twelve monthsafter the end of hostilities in Europe. The Minister was anxiousto reach this figure and, if possible, to improve on it; but wouldnot be able to do so unless a special registration was made of allcraftsmen and labourers with previous experience in the building and civil engineering industries. If his proposals were approved,the registration would probably, and the subsequent transfer of ex-building workers would certainly, take place after the end ofhostilities in Europe. This would involve making substantial use,after that time, of the powers of labour direction. The Government&quot;were pledged, by the White Paper on Re-Allocation of CivilianManpower (Cmd. 6568), to use these powers after the end of theEuropean war only for directing persons to essential work of thehighest urgency. The Minister felt, however, that the urgency of essential housing would justify the use of these powers for returning to the building industry men who had previously worked in it and could be made available for building work.Points in discussion were : -(a) Would these proposals limit the freedom of men released from the Armed Forces in Class A to retain whatever employmentthey had found for themselves during the period of their paidfurlough \The Minister of Labour and National Service explained thatthese men would not be affected by the proposed registration, whichwould take place before releases in Class A had begun.(b) The Minister of Production asked whether machinery wouldbe established for ensuring that Supply Departments were consulted before building workers were withdrawn from key positions in munitions industries.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that thispoint would not arise at the stage of registration, but agreed thatsome such machinery &quot;for consultation would be required at a later stage.(c) The War Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Workssupported the proposals put forward in W.P. (45) 276.The War Cabinets-Authorised the Minister Of Labour and National Service tomake a special registration of craftsmen and labourers with previous experience in the building and civil engineering industries, on the lines proposed in W.P. (45) 276.Syria andthe Lebanon.(previous reference:W.M.(45)57thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Prime Minister read out the draft of a telegram whichhe proposed to send to General de Gaulle, on the lines agreed bythe War Cabinet at their meeting on the previous day, indicatinghis willingness to order the withdrawal of all British troops fromSyria and the Lebanon as soon as a Treaty had been concluded andwas in operation between the French Government and the Syrianand Lebanese Governments.This draft had been considered by the Chiefs of Staff earlierthat morning. They had suggested that it would be preferable to omit the statement that British troops had been retained in Syriaand the Lebanon because it offered a convenient training ground for the Italian theatre of war. As German resistance in Italy had now collapsed, General de Gaulle, might use this statement as abasis for demanding that our troops should be removed forthwith.Subject to amendment on this point, the Chiefs of Staff favoured[29981-2] - b2
the &quot;despatch of a telegram to General de Gaulle in the terms proposed. -The further suggestion had been made by the Foreign office that a sentence should be included in the draft to the effect that,so long as, relations between the French -and the Levant Statesremained undefined, we had to be on our guard against disturbanceswhich might affect the whole of the Middle East.; The War Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would amend the draft to take account of the suggestions made by the Chiefs of-- Staff and the Foreign Office; and agreed that the telegram,as so amended, should be despatched to General de Gaulle.Denmark. 3.   The Prime Minister drew attention to a telegram from Stockholm (No. 799 of the 3rd May) stating that,, according to information received from the Swedish Minister at/ Copenhagen,small reconnaissance groups of Russians had landed by parachutein South-East Zeeland. Political circles in Denmark were disturbed at this development, as German troops in Denmark were likely tooffer resistance, and disorder might also be provoked by DanishCommunists.. ,     The War Cabinet had some discussion of the situation in denmark; and the Prime Minister undertook to communicate with. the Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force.4. The War Cabinet resumed their consideration of theMemorandum by the Home Secretary (W.P. (45) 222) on the legalbasis of economic control in the transition period.In discussion, it was claimed that the course proposed by theHome Secretary in his Memorandum would have the following advantages. It would enable existing emergency powers to be usedfor the economic purposes of the transition period. - It would putthat use of these powers beyond challenge in the courts, and would preclude the criticism that these powers were being used forpurposes Which Parliament had not contemplated when they wereconferred. It would also concede to Parliament a- further measureof control over the exercise of those powers after the end of the warin Europe. The Act, if passed,-would not remain in operation for more than two years unless Parliament saw fit to extend it for afurther period. And the Government of the day would be free todetermine the extent to which use should be made of the powers ofeconomic control so conferred.&quot; / The Prime Minister said that he Was impressed by theadvantages which the discussion had shown to lie in the course proposed in the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum. He would supportlegislation on the lines proposed; and he would be agreeable that his name should appear on the back of the proposed Bill.In further discussion, it was suggested that the preambleincluded in the draft Bill annexed to W.P. (45) 222 might provokeunnecessary controversy in Parliament, and it was the general viewof the War Cabinet that this preamble should be omitted from theBill.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in W.P. (45) 222 for fresh legisla-tion authorising the use of existing emergency powers,,   Jiqr the economic purposes of the: transition period;(2) Approved in principle the draft Bill annexed to W.P. (45).......;: -222, subject to the omission of the preamble; and invited] VI..the Home Secretary to submit the Bill for detailed. /examination by the Legislation Committee, and there-after to arrange for its early introduction in the House. of Commons. . ;:economic controls in theTransitionPeriod.(previous reference:W.M.(45)51stConclusions,Minute 2.)
5.   The-War Cabinet had before them-^ --(i) a report by the India. Committee oh policy in Burma.(w.p. (45)275);and -   .      \, &apos;(ii) a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Burma(W.P. (45) 280) covering the draft of a statement to bemade in Parliament.- The Secretary of State for Burma said that the Committee&apos;srecommendations were summarised in paragraph 25 of their report,which was unanimous. At the end Of the period of direct militaryrule, which the War Cabinet had already agreed should follow onthe liberation of Burma, there would have to be a continuation of direct control by the Governor which would necessitate the extensionfor a further period of the Emergency Provisions (section 139) of theGovernment of Burma Act, 1935. Parliaments approval to thecontinuance of the existing Proclamation under that section wouldhave to be obtained before the 10th June, and it was proposed totake the opportunity to continue the section in operation up toDecember 1948. Power would at the same time be taken toliberalise its operation so as to enable the Governor, if he desired, toestablish, for example, an Executive Council or an Advisory Councilof a Wider character. At the end of the period of direct ruleunder Section 139, the normal operation of the Government of burma Act, 1935, would be resumed until such period as it wasreplaced by a constitution of a different character, That would bethe stage at which Burma would be in a position to discuss what herfinal constitution should be; and when, in due course, agreement hadbeen reached on that matter, and the other necessary preliminaryconditions had been satisfied (in particular, the conclusion of what-ever treaty or other arrangement was required to safeguard the continuing obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government in burma and the repayment of sums advanced to her by the imperial exchequer) Burma would attain full self-government within theBritish Commonwealth.- The Secretary of State did not expect the proposed legislation to be controversial. He would propose, if the War cabinet approved, to publish the statement circulated with W.P. (45) 280 aspart of a White Paper on Burma which would be circulated at thesame time as the draft Bill and preferably before Whitsuntide. It&apos; was important, both for the Supreme Commander and in view ofpublic opinion in the United States, that our proposals should bemade known as soon as possible.The Lord Chancellor suggested that the opening sentence of thedraft statement circulated with W.P. (45) 280 should be amended toavoid any suggestion that we regarded ourselves as responsible for&quot;establishing&quot; full self-government in Burma. This would provoke a demand that we should discharge a similar responsibilityfor &quot;establishing&quot; self-government in India, in default of agree-ment among the main sections of political opinion in India. Hesuggested, as an alternative phrase, &quot;the considered policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to use their best endeavours to promotefull self-government in Burma.&quot; The Secretary of State for burma accepted this amendment and suggested that any membersof the India Committee who might have other comments to make onthe draft statement should send them to him direct.The War Cabinet-.(1) Approved the recommendations of the India Committee asset out in W.P.- (45) 275. &quot;&apos; (2) Approved the general lines of the draft statement circulated with W.P. (45) 280, subject to any comments which ministers might send direct to the Secretary of State forv Burma. .(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Burma to submit a proof of the proposed White Paper to the War Cabinet.
Parliament. 6.   At their meeting on the 20th April the War Cabinet hadElectoral invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for.ScotlandReform. to hold informal consultations with the Members of Parliament who(Previous had served on the Speaker &quot;s Conference and with the Chief PartyReference: Agents, on the proposals made in Section I (a) and (6) of w.M.(45)47th W.P! (45) 215 regarding the maximum scale of candidates&apos; expensesConclusions, and, pending this, had agreed to postpone further consideration of minute 3.)     the remaining proposals in W.P. (45) 215; . -The War Cabinet now had before them, in addition to/   - &apos; W.P. (45)215-(i) Memorandum by the Home Secretary (W.P. (45) 279)reporting the result of these informal consultations; and(ii) Memorandum by the Home Secretary and -Secretary ofState for Scotland (W.P. (45) 278) on defects in the May-     electoral register.The War Cabinet considered first the maximum scale of- candidates&apos; expenses.The Home Secretary explained that, in^the consultations whichhe had held at the War Cabinet&apos;s request,.no Member had advocatedan increase of more than 25 per cent, in the maximum scale of expenses recommended by the Speaker&apos;s Conference. A minority in each Party had favoured a 25 per cent, increase, and the general feeling had been definitely against departing from the recom-mendations of the Speaker&apos;s Conference. He. was himself still, &quot;&apos; &apos; inclined to think that a 25 per cent, increase would be justified;but the scale of candidates&apos; expenses was essentially a matter forthe House of Commons, and he accordingly recommended that theBill as introduced should prescribe the scale recommended by the speaker&apos;s Conference. It could then be left to the House to decide,if the point were raised, whether the scale should be temporarilyincreased and, if so, by what amount. .The War Cabinet then turned to a preliminary discussion ofthe proposals in Section I (c) (i) to (iv) of W.P. (45)215 and in w.P. (45)278. No decisions were reached, but it was agreed thatthe Departments might proceed with the preparation of a Bill onthe basis of the proposals in W.P. (45) 215 and W.P. (45) 279. Itwould not, of course, be possible to secure the passage of this Bill- - in time for an election held earlier than October 1945.The War Cabinet- . .(1) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland, in the light of the discussion; to prepare and- submit to them the draft of an Electoral (Miscellaneous- - Provisions) Bill.(2)&quot; Agreed to give further consideration to the issues raised in W.P. (45) 215, W.P. (45) 279 and W.P. (45) 278 whenthey had the draft Bill before them.General .Election.Paper.(previous reference:W.M.(45)47thConclusions,Minute 6.).7. At their meeting on the 20th April the War Cabinet had invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, in conjunctionwith the Ministers concerned, the practical arrangements requiredto give effect to the scheme which they had approved in principle for the allocation of paper for the General Election.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported that he had held ameeting on the 30th April with the Home Secretary, the Ministerof Education, the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Air (Lord Sherwood) and the Chief Party Agents, at which ithad been agreed that paper should be allocated to Party Head-quarters for central purposes on the basis of one ton per candidatewith a bonus, of five tons (or such lesser ^amount as would bring their total allocation up to forty tons) for Parties with less thanforty candidates. The Paper Controller would license the appro-priate quantity of paper for each Party Headquarters on being
notified by them of the numberof. candidates, which they expected to run and on receiving an undertaking that they would not use agreater amount of paper than that to which they would eventually be entitled on the basis proposed. Party Headquarters would becalled on to notify to the Paper Controller in due course the numberof actual candidates and the tonnage of paper used. Where thenumber of actual candidates exceeded the estimate the necessaryadditional paper would be made available. As stated in paragraph 5of the Annex to W.P. (45) 241, it was understood that quotasallocated to individual candidates would not be transferable andthat both Party Headquarters and indiyidual candidates wouldrestrict their acquisitions of paper to the quotas made available tothem in accordance with the approved allocations,The War Cabinet-Approved the arrangements outlined by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer for the allocation of paper for the GeneralElection.Parliament.electoral reform:VotingArrangementsfor Membersof the Forces.(previous reference:W.M. (45)2ndConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The Home Secretary informed the War Cabinet that theWar Office had not found it possible to distribute until the 1st may the appropriate application forms under the scheme of postal votingfor the Forces. A considerable number of these forms would nodoubt be returned during May, but those from more distant areas,notably Burma, might not be returned before the end of June. If,therefore, a General Election were held before July there was a danger that some members of the Forces who would still be fighting in the front line would not be able to vote by post.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.ArrangementsforCelebratingthe End ofHostilities inEurope.Parliament.(previous reference:W.M.(45)53rdConclusions.)9. The Prime Minister &quot;informed the War Cabinet that hehad received a letter from Mr. Speaker on the questions (i) whetherParliament should be specially summoned if an announcement thathostilities had ceased in Europe were to be made on a day when parliament would not be sitting; and (ii) whether it would not be preferable that the proposed service at St. Margaret&apos;s, Westminster, ,should be held on the day following that announcement.He had reviewed, in the light of Mr. Speaker&apos;s letter, thearrangements approved by the War Cabinet on the 27th April. Hewas disposed to think that it would not be desirable to callParliament together if the announcement fell to be made during aweek-end adjournment. He proposed to inform Mr. Speakeraccordingly; and he would add, on the second question, that if theannouncement were made on a day when Parliament was not sitting,the service in St. magaret&apos;s, Westminster, should be held on thefirst sitting day thereafter. If, on the other hand, the House ofCommons was in session when the time came to make the announce-ment, he would, after his broadcast announcement, come to theHouse and ask leave to interrupt business in order to make anannouncement in the House; and in that event it would seemappropriate that the House should adjourn that same day for ashort service of thanksgiving in St. magaret&apos;s, Westminster.It was pointed out in discussion that, if the service inSt. Margaret&apos;s were held at short notice, the more elaborate arrange-ments proposed by Mr. Speaker could not be put into effect; andthere would be special difficulty in carrying out the full programmeif the service had to be held after 6 p.m. The general view of theWar Cabinet was, however, that if the announcement of the end ofhostilities were made &quot;on a day when Parliament was sitting, theservice in St. magaret&apos;s should be held on the same day.
The War Cabinet-&apos;,; Invited the Prime Minister to reply to Mr. Speaker&apos;s letter in the sense indicated above; and to arrange for Membersof Parliament to be informed that it was not proposed to summon a special meeting of Parliament if the announce-ment of the end of hostilities were made while Parliamentstood adjourned for the.week-end.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,4th May, 1945.
