He felt himself that minute 8.)      we could not press upon the French any objection to the despatchat any rate of the first detachment, which was in the nature of a relief.  But before the time came to send in the other detachments,we ought to review our own military position in the Lebanon.  TheFrench were doubtless influenced by suspicions that we intended tomaintain permanent  military establishments  in  the Lebanon.Hitherto we had needed the Lebanon as a training ground forreinforcements for our Armies in Italy; but now that german resistance in Italy had collapsed this would no longer be required.In these circumstances we might well take the line with the French that, as soon as they had concluded their Treaty with Syria and the lebanon, we would withdraw our troops on the assumption that theywould also withdraw theirs; and that in the meantime it wouldbe unwise of them to jeopardise the conclusion of a Treaty by putting in reinforcements.The Secretary of State for War said that arrangements were already in train to withdraw our combatant troops from the lebanon, though it would take a little longer to remove theadministrative troops. The French had not, however, been informed of these arrangements.The Prime Minister suggested that he should meet with theMinister of Production, the Minister of Aircraft Production, theSecretary of State for War and the Chiefs of Staff, to review themilitary position and to consider such questions as whether theLyttelton-de Gaulle Agreement had now come to an end. He wouldthereafter telegraph proposals to General de Gaulle which wouldbe designed to remove any impression that we were anxious tosupplant the French in Syria and the Lebanon.The War Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to deal with this matter on thelines indicated above.War Crimes.(previous reference:W.M.(45)43rdConclusions,Minute 2.)- 2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord Chancellor (W.P. (45) 281).The Lord Chancellor recalled that at their meeting on the12th April the War Cabinet had invited him to prepare for transmission to the United States authorities a statement of theobjections felt by His Majesty&apos;s Government to any formalprocedure for trial or judicial enquiry into the misdeeds of theprincipal Nazi leaders. This statement was in course of prepara-tion when it became known that M. Molotov was going to the san francisco Conference, and that the subject of war criminals mightbe raised there. The Lord Chancellor had, therefore, arranged thatthe Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shouldtake with him to San Francisco a copy of the draft statement nowreproduced as Annex B to W.P. (45) 281. The substance, though not the text, of this draft statement had also been communicatedto Judge Rosenman before he returned to the United States.From a Washington telegram, reproduced as Annex A toW.P. (45) 281, it appeared that a meeting of Foreign Secretarieswas to be held in San Francisco that evening to receive a report fromJudge Rosenman on matters relating to war criminals; and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs had asked for guidance fromthe War Cabinet as to the line which he should take at this meeting.
The Minister of State said that there were three types of warcriminal to be considered : (i) the ordinary war criminal, chargedwith an offence committed in the territory of an Allied Government.He would be handed over to that Government to be dealt with and presented no difficulty, (ii) An intermediate category, of whichKramer of Relsen and the local heads of the Gestapo throughoutGermany were examples. Judge Rosenman had suggested thatthese cases might be dealt with by first establishing in a singleconspiracy trial that the Gestapo was a criminal conspiracy, and arranging that thereafter individual members could be punishedon proof of membership of that conspiracy. That suggestion was acceptable in principle, if we could be satisfied that the handling of cases against individual members of the Gestapo would not layan intolerable burden on the occupying authority., (iii) The majorcriminals whose offences had no geographical location. These boththe United States and the Russians were anxious to have tried byjudicial procedure. We were opposed to this, but had not so far been able to carry our point. The Foreign Office felt that we might now take the line that, with the death of Hitler, Mussolini and other leaders, circumstances &quot;had changed; that it would be inexpedient to have State trials of the lesser leaders; and that we should nowaim at bringing all the offenders into one or other of the first two categories to which he had referred. The majority of the leaderscould then be dealt with under the first limb of the MoscowDeclaration as having been responsible for specific war crimesagainst specified Allied nationals, and most of the remainder underJudge Rosenman&apos;s scheme for dealing with the leaders of the gestapo as having been parties to a criminal conspiracy.A general discussion followed, in which the following points were made: (a) While there were likely to be great difficulties of procedure in a State trial of the major criminals, it would be inexpedient tocontinue to oppose the combined views of the United States and theSoviet Governments, or to allow ourselves to get into a position inwhich we should appear to be denying to the individuals chargedany opportunity of answering the charges preferred against them.We should therefore accept their views in principle, but should puton them the onus of producing a workable procedure before wecommitted ourselves finally.(6) Would there not be advantage in pressing for a singleconspiracy trial which would cover the Gestapo and all the other leaders \ We should at least deprecate a large number of separateState trials. It was suggested that this point was one which shouldbe put tentatively to the other Governments. It was desirable toavoid producing the impression that we were trying to upset their plan. There was also advantage if we proposed to invite them towork out a procedure, in letting them find out for themselves thedifficulties involved.(c) An intolerable burden might be placed on the military courts if they were to be required to trv as war criminals all personsin their area who were alleged to have been members of the Gestapo.Some discretion must be left to the military authorities.id) There would be great practical difficulties in setting upmixed military courts including representatives of different AlliedGovernments.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that theWar Cabinet appeared to be agreed on the following points : (i) No difficulty arose over the ordinary war criminal whoseoffence was committed in the territory of an Allied Government.He would be handed over to that Government for trial.(ii) War crimes committed in enemy territory should be tried by military courts. These oases could be dealt with either by themilitary court for the area in which the offender was held prisoner,or by the military court for the area in which the offence was committed. A manual of guidance agreed between the Allies would
be necessary for such courts, and we might aim at securing thatthey should be courts of a single nation and not mixed courts.(iii) We should support Judge Bosenman&apos;s scheme for estab-lishing in a conspiracy trial that the leaders and active membersof the Gestapo were members of a common enterprise engaged ina criminal conspiracy. We should, however, ask for a detailed statement of the procedure proposed both for the main trial and forthe punishment of persons subsequently found to have been membersof this criminal conspiracy.(iv) As regards the major criminals whose offences had nogeographical location, we should not oppose the joint view of theUnited States and the Soviet Governments, but should invite themto produce a workable procedure before we finally committedourselves to agreement that these persons should be put on trial.We should also point out that the situation had materially changedin the last few days with the death of Hitler and Mussolini andother prominent leaders, and the probability that still more of them would be killed before the fighting was over.The War Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the proposals summarised at (i) to (iv) above and agreed that a telegram should be despatched to theForeign Secretary in the terms set out in the appendix to these Minutes.(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for War had prepare the draft of a Manual of Procedure to be followed byBritish military courts in dealing with war crimescommitted against Allied nationals; and invited theSecretary of State, for War to discuss this draft withthe Lord Chancellor, the Attorney-General and theMinister of Aircraft Production before submitting it for final approval by the Prime Minister.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,3rd May, 1945.Appendix.Telegram from Prime Minister to Foreign Secretary.1.   The War Cabinet considered the question of war criminals this after-noon and their provisional views are as follows%- The position as regards the major war criminals has greatly changed since this matter was last considered. Many of them have already been killed and the same fate may well overtake others before the fighting is over.3. The War Cabinet still see objections to having formal State trials for .the most notorious war criminals whose crimes have no geographical location.But if our two major Allies remain convinced that this is necessary, we are willing to accept their views in principle. We would, however, wish to see theform of trial and procedure suggested by our two major Allies set out in writingbefore any final decision is arrived at.4. We look with favour on Judge Rosenman&apos;s &quot;scheme for a special procedure to try the leaders and active members of the Gestapo as members ofa common enterprise engaged in a criminal conspiracy. But we would like toknow how the scheme would be applied, and how the individuals who are chargedwith being members of this enterprise would be selected for trial.5. At the same time, military tribunals will be in existence for the trial of ordinary war criminals whose crimes were committed in Germany. It might be convenient to leave a large number of those belonging to guilty categories to bedealt with by these Military Courts, as we still feel that the smaller number ofState trials, the better. We also think that these cases should be tried by courts of one nationality only, that nationality being either the nation which holds the criminal or which is occupying the regions in which his particular crime was committed.
