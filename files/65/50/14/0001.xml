Civil Defence.disbandment of Civil     -defence services -Iand EoyalObserverCorps.1. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (45) 258) on the disbandment of the Civil Defence Services.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security proposedthat the war-time organisation of Civil Defence should be disbandedas soon as the Chiefs of Staff had advised that further attacks onthis country by aircraft, flying-bombs or long-range rockets were no longer to be expected. Once the local authorities had been instructed to disband the organisation, the Services would be unableto function on an operational basis. Part-time members would be released at once: whole-time members would receive two months&apos;notice and in that time would be progressively released as other work was found for them by the Ministry of Labour.The Secretary of State for A ir said that the process of dis-banding the Royal Observer Corps should start simultaneously withthat of disbanding the Civil Defence Services. It would, however,be necessary, as a preliminary, to devise alternative arrangements to replace the services which the Royal Observer Corps now per-formed in relation to aircraft safety. It would also be desirableto retain a nucleus organisation, so that the Corps could be recon-stituted in any future emergency. He would consult with theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security so as to ensurethat the arrangements for the disbandment of the Royal observer corps were concerted, particularly as regards any public announce-ment, with those for the disbandment of the Civil Defence Services.The Minister of Labour and National Service asked whetherthe proposals in W.P. (45) 258 extended to the National fire service. This Service contained a number of drivers and able-bodied men who were urgently required at the present time for civil work. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security pointedout that for the National Fire Service, which had a peace-timefunction, the problem was not one of disbandment, but of reduction to peace-time strength. This reduction was already proceeding;but he undertook to consider whether it could be accelerated.The general view of the War Cabinet was that, subject to theviews of the Chiefs of Staff, local authorities should be advised toproceed forthwith to give notice to whole-time members of the civil defence Services and to begin the process of winding up the wholeof the war-time organisation for Civil Defence. corresponding action should be taken in respect of the Royal Observer Corps.The War Cabinet -(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange to obtainthat day the views of the Chiefs of Staff on the questionwhether further air attack on this country was to beexpected;(2) Subject to the views of the Chiefs of Staff on this, point,agreed that immediate steps should be taken to begin the disbandment of the Civil Defence Services and theRoyal Observer Corps.   .economic controls in theTransitionPeriod.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 147thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (45)&apos; 222) on thelegal basis of economic control in the transition period.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat, in his view, it was inexpedient that the economic controlsrequired in the transition period beginning with the end ofhostilities in Europe should continue to rest on powers conferred bythe Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts. During this periodeconomic controls would increasingly be used, not for the purposesof the war against Japan, but for securing a smooth transition froma war-time to a peace-time economy. These were not the purposes which Parliament had in mind when it conferred these powers on
the Executive and their use for such purposes would be liable to challenge in Parliament, if not the Courts. Parliament hadalready shown anxiety about the extent to which these powers might be used after the end of the war in Europe and about the need for further Parliamentary safeguards; and theHouse of Commons had only been willing to renew the Acts forthe current year on the understanding that, before the question offurther renewal arose, Parliament would be given a full opportunityof reviewing the situation and considering, in particular, the useof economic controls for the purposes of the transition period. Inthese circumstances, the Home Secretary thought that the time had now come to separate the powers of economic control from thedefence powers required for the war against Japan; to seek expressParliamentary authority for the use of economic controls after theend of the war in Europe for purposes other than purely war purposes; and to concede a greater measure of parliamentary control over the exercise of these powers of economic-control. Thedraft Bill annexed to his Memorandum was designed to give effectto these objectives. Tt was a Bill which ought, in his view, to be presented to Parliament by a Government representing all the main political Parties. It ought to be passed into law before theEmergency Powers (Defence) Acts fell due for further renewal inJuly. And it ought to be in operation soon after the end ofhostilities in Europe. If, therefore, the War Cabinet accepted his proposals, the Bill ought to be introduced into Parliament at anearly date.The Bill had been prepared under the direction of the Recon-struction Committee; and the Minister of Reconstruction concurred in the proposals made in his Memorandum.The Lord Privy Seal said that legislation on the lines proposed would place on a different, and more permanent basis powers ofeconomic control which had been assumed only for purposesconnected with the war. Clause 1 (1) (&amp;) of the draft Bill annexed to W.P. (45) 222 seemed to him to imply that these controls wouldbe continued on a peace-time basis after all hostilities had ended.The statement about the continuance of controls which the PrimeMinister had made in the House of Commons on the16th November, 1944, related only to the period between the defeat of Germany and the defeat of Japan. And an earlier statement made by the Secretary of State for Air, with the Prime Minister&apos;authority, in a broadcast speech on the 21st August, 1940, hadcontained the assurance that &quot; all those emergency measures which affect the liberty of the subject shall disappear with the passing ofthe emergency.&quot; The Law Officers had advised that the emergencycontemplated by the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts covered, notonly the period of hostilities, but, within limits, the dislocationwhich the conduct of hostilities had caused in the national life;and, so far as concerned at any rate the early part of the transition period, such economic controls as were still required could continueto be based on powers derived from the Emergency Powers (Defence)Acts. Parliamentary criticism would, in his view, be directedmainly against the retention of Defence Regulation 18b and similarRegulations limiting personal liberty; and these criticisms wouldbe met by the withdrawal of those Regulations at the end of the warin Europe. In these circumstances he would prefer to continue to rely on the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts and to postpone anyquestion of further legislation until the end of the Japanese war.Points in further discussion were : (a) While the- Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts would clearlycover matters arising directly out of the war (e.g., matters connectedwith the demobilisation of the Armed Forces), there would be room for legal argument on the question whether powers derived fromthose Acts could properly be used for enforcing priorities in post-war reconstruction e.g., controlling the use of timber so as toensure sufficient supplies for the post-war housing programme.After the last war there had been some disposition on the part of
the Courts to challenge the continued use of war-time powers afterhostilities had ended. It seemed undesirable to run the risk of asimilar challenge on this occasion. It would be preferable to put the matter beyond doubt by obtaining fresh Parliamentary sanction for the use of these powers for the purposes of the transition period.(b) Some powers of economic control would be needed so longas shortages continued, and it was already clear that some shortageswould continue beyond the end of the Japanese war. Thus, in theeconomic field, some emergency powers would probably, be neededbeyond the date on which the need for defence powers would dis-appear. There was likely to be a strong demand for increasedParliamentary supervision of these powers of economic control; andone of the main objects of the legislation now suggested was to concede an increased measure of Parliamentary control in this field.(c) The Minister of Labour and National Service said that,in matters affecting his Department, it was becoming increasingly&quot;clear that some emergency powers would be required for the pur-poses of the transition period. He was now engaged, with theMinister of Works, in discussions with the building industry whichwere likely to result in their accepting measures of dilution inreturn for a special agreement regulating conditions of employ-ment in house-building work. There were likely to be other casesof this kind; and it would hardly be practicable to promote special legislation on each occasion for the enforcement of such agreements.The form of the draft Bill annexed to W.P. (45) 222 might need further consideration; but he believed that, in principle, someextension of emergency powers to cover the purposes of the transi-tion period would be required.(d) The new legislation proposed by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security would be permissive. It would be forthe Government of the day to determine the extent to which these powers should be continued for the purposes of the transition period,and the use which should be made of powers so extended. Theintroduction of such legislation would be quite consistent with apolicy for the gradual relaxation of economic controls.The War Cabinet, while reaching no final conclusion,Were disposed to favour the general approach to this problem indicated in the Memorandum (W.P. (45) 222) bythe Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security; and agreed to consider at an early meeting proposals for legisla-tion embodied in the draft Bill annexed to that memorandum.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,25th April, 1945.   ;
