The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.On the Western front the weather had been good, but there hadinevitably been a decline in the number of available targets. allied air Forces had flown an average of 6,500 sorties a day.Bomber Command had flown just under 4,000 sorties for theloss of 14 aircraft, and had dropped nearly 10,000 tons of bombs.In an attack on the Lutzow on the 16th April, three direct hitsand one near miss had been scored and reconnaissance now showed that she was aground. Successful attacks had also been made onHeligoland on the 18th and 19th April. There had been daylightraids on Munich, Regensburg and Bremen and night attacks onPilsen and Schwandorf. Mosquitoes had attacked Berlin on six.nights.United States bombers had flown 6,400 sorties for the loss of18 aircraft and had dropped nearly 14,000 tons of bombs. Targetshad included rail communications in Southern Germany and Berlin.The Tactical Air Force had flown 3,300 sorties for the loss of193 aircraft, and had destroyed 8,000 and damaged 9,000 enemymotor vehicles.Losses of enemy aircraft during the week were 1,984 destroyed,36 probably destroyed and 1,250 damaged. About six-sevenths were destroyed or damaged on the groundAir supply had recently assumed increasing importance.During the last week 6,300 sorties had been flown and 14,000 tonscarried. The total numbers of released prisoners and casualtiesbrought to this country by air since D-Day were 20,000 and 277,500respectively.Coastal Command had flown 1,688 sorties for the loss of  aircraft. 20 U-boats had been sighted and 14 attacked : one hadbeen sunk and 3 possibly damaged, while 3 promising attacks hadbeen made. One midget submarine had been sunk. In attacks onsurface craft, 9 merchant vessels and 1 tanker had been damaged.45 Mosquitoes returning from a shipping reconnaissance off Norwayhad without loss destroyed 9 out of 18 enemy long-range bombersencountered over the North Sea.The German Air Force in Norway was believed to consist of285 aircraft, including 80 long-range bombers.In the Mediterranean 22,000 sorties had been flown for the ^ossof 89 aircraft. Communications in Austria and Southern germany had been attacked and support had been given to our land forces in italy.   Enemy losses had been 21 aircraft.In South-East Asia 13,000 sorties had been flown for the loss of5 aircraft. Operations, which had been mainly in support of our land forces, had also included an attack on docks and power stations at Bangkok. 12,000 tons of stores and 7,000 troops had been carried by air. A party had now arrived at the Cocos Islands to open astaging post and fighters based on this post were now ready for action.In China, 1,000 sorties had been flown for the loss of 4 aircraft.11 enemy aircraft had been destroyed on the ground.In the Pacific, 6,000 sorties had been flown for the loss of1 aircraft. Enemy losses were -2 destroyed in the air and 28 on theground. Targets had included airfields in Formosa, the docks at hong-Kong and oil storage plants at Canton.Super Fortresses had flown 840 sorties for the loss of 20 aircraft tand had dropped 5,000 tons of bombs. The main attacks had been on Tokyo (2,000 tons) and Kawasaki (1,300 tons). 27 square miles of Tokyo had now been devastated by air attacks.Ten merchant vessels, totalling 53,483 tons had been lost by enemy action during the week. Losses for April how amounted to95*774 tons. During .the week 4 U-boats had probably been sunk and there had been 5 promising attacks. U-boats were active inthe North-West and South-West approaches to the North Sea, off theAmerican east coast and oft Kola inlet. About 60 were probably&quot;7      at sea at present.[29935-51 b 2

A successful minelaying operation had been carried out off Kolainlet.   3 midget U-boats had been sunk and 2 possibly sunk duringthe week..-Mediterranean. Between the 11th and 16th April one of our cruisers, with united States and French destroyers, had bombarded enemy positions on the French-Italian frontier. Attacks had been made on two enemy convoys in the North Adriatic.East Indies. In recent patrols 4 of our submarines had sunk 3 small enemycraft.Pacific. Operations in the Okinawa area had continued.   The BritishPacific Fleet had made -further successful attacks on airfields in theSakishima group.Military After  meeting considerable opposition, especially  in theOperations. Nuremberg area, the 1st French and 7th United States Armies hadNorth-West made very rapid advances -towards the end of the week. The FrenchEurope. forces had taken Freiburg and Stuttgart and, reaching the SwissFrontier, had now moved eastward along the northern shore of lake Constance. The United States forces had reached the Danubeastride of Ulm and had seized a bridge intact at Dillingen. Gainshad also been made on the 3rd United States Army front and the czech border had been crossed. Leipzig had been cleared by the1st United States Army and the Harz mountain pocket had beeneliminated, with the capture of the German 11th Army headquarters and .3 Corps Commanders. The whole of the Ruhr was now under allied control: in this area 17 German Divisions had beeneliminated and 320,000 prisoners taken. The 9th United states army were regrouping and had held off counter-attacks on theirElbe bridgehead. British 2nd Army forces had cleared the South Bank of the Elbe from south of Lauenburg to the suburbs of Ham-burg. Stiff resistance was being encountered both at Hamburg and bremen.North-East Holland was now practically clear of enemy troops and Western Holland had been virtually sealed off. Reportsabout flooding by the enemy were conflicting, but there was no definite evidence that the enemy had yet resorted to flooding whichcould not be related to military needs.Since the crossing of the Rhine, British casualties had beena 13,000 and United States casualties 38,000.  Over 1 million enemyprisoners had been taken.Russia. The Russians were maintaining a very strict security silencewith regard to their advances from the Oder. From Germanadmissions, however, it seemed clear that they had launched two main attacks, one between Eberswald and Frankfurt and the otherbetween Forst and Gorlitz. The northern attack had probablyreached the suburbs of Berlin : the other was evidently aimed atencircling the city from the south and west. The Russians had made comparatively little progress in Czechoslovakia and Austria.Heavy fighting along the whole of the Italian front had cul-minated in a break-through after the capture of Bologna&quot;; andforces of the 8th and 5th Armies&apos; were row moving on Ferrara,Bondeno and Modena. 25,000 prisoners had been taken and our casualties had been 10,000. The battle was going very well, and ifthe Po crossings could be seized quickly it. should be possible to cutoff a number of enemy divisions on the western sector of the front.The Prime Minister said that the achievement of the 8th.and 5th Armies had been remarkable, especially when account was taken of the extent to which their strength had been depleted by the with-drawal of forces for other campaigns. He was proposing to send a telegram of congratulation to Field-Marshal Alexander; and he hoped that the publication of this message would give the Pressah opportunity to give full publicity and credit to the outstandingachievements of these Armies.Burma. Marked progress had been made on both the lines of advance to Rangoon.   About 8,000 Japanese troops appeared to have beenItaly.
isolated by our advances towards Magwe; and on the other lineof advance our troops had captured the airfield at Toungoo.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.2. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theMinister of Information (W.P. (45) 203) and the Chiefs of Staff(W.P. (45) 245) on the extent to which publicity should be given tothe Report of a technical intei-Services mission which had examined the large &apos;&apos; Crossbow &apos;&apos; sites in Northern Prance.The Minister of Information said that a good deal of informa-tion about the existence and purpose of these sites had already been published without official authority, and he thought it would be useful if the full story were now officially released to the Press. Thepublic in this country should know how narrowly they had escapeddisaster. Publication of these facts might also have a salutary effect in the United States.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff raisedno objection to the unofficial release to the Press of the information contained in this Report, so long as the Report itself was not published and information about the Mimoyecques gun was with-held. They recognised that details about this gun would form themost striking part of the story; and that some information about it had already been disclosed unofficially. If, however, we nowreleased this information officially, other countries would no longerhave any doubts about its accuracy; and research in other countries might thereby be facilitated.In discussion the view was expressed that, apart from thesecurity objections advanced on behalf of the Chiefs of Staff, itwas doubtful how the official release of this information would bereceived now by people in this country, particularly in London andthe Home Counties. The relief might be tempered by apprehensionlest, even at this late stage, the enemy had some further surprisein store for them. The general view of the War Cabinet was thatit might be preferable to postpone for a time the official releaseof the information contained in this Report. At the same time,it was recognised that the publication of this information couldnot be delayed indefinitely, and that there would be advantages in preparing, for circulation in this country and in the United States,a book in which the full story of all the &quot; Crossbow &quot; weapons wouldbe told at length. It might take as long as two months to prepare the book for publication; and by that tinae there might be less objection to publishing this information. Moreover, it would be inappropriate to include in such a publication much of the technical information to the disclosure of which the Chiefs of Staff had raised objection.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Information to arrange for thepreparation of a book dealing with the &quot;Crossbow&quot;weapons as a whole, and to submit the draft for examina-tion by the Chiefs of Staff;(2) Agreed that, when the proposed book had been prepared,the timing of its publication should be further consideredby the War Cabinet.&quot; Crossbow.&quot;Publicityabout Sitesin northern france.(previous reference erence :W.M.(45)41stConclusions,Minute 1.) -[29935-5]
Housing. 3   The &quot;War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theProduction Minister of Works (W.P.-(45) 266) seeking authority for the intro-Agreements duction of legislation empowering the Minister to make agreementsBulk Orders for the production of housing materials, components or fittings, orand Erection of complete houses; to buy and sell any such items; and to undertakeof Houses by the development of sites belonging to local authorities and thethe Ministry    erection of houses on them.of Works. Minister of Works explained that this legislation was required to implement undertakings given in the recent white paper on Housing (Cmd. 6609). The power to make agreements for the production of materials, components and fittings was neces-sary in order to give manufacturers an assurance of a market fortheir products, and so ensure that they would put standard articlesinto production without waiting for specific orders. It was not clear how far it would be necessary to give bulk orders for materials,components and fittings, but a power to buy and resell would be needed at an early date in connection with the erection of timberhouses from Sweden. The power to develop local authority sites and undertake the erection of houses on them was needed because some of the types of houses which might be used would requirespecial technical skill for their erection, and because prisoners ofwar could not be employed for this purpose unless the work were carried out by the Ministry of Works. The new powers would betaken only for the period up to the 1st October, 1947, at which date other housing legislation would fall to be reviewed If neces--sary, the powers could then be continued.Points in discussion were : -(a) The War Cabinet were informed that, although the powerto develop local authority sites and erect houses on them would beexercised by the Minister of Works only at the request of the HealthMinister concerned and only with the agreement of the localauthority, the Secretary of State for Scotland had proposed thatthis power should not.extend to Scotland. It was generally felt thatit would be unfortunate if this had the result of retarding theerection of houses in Scotland. It might be preferable that the bill as introduced should provide for the application of this power to scotland, though this provision could be modified if it were strongly opposed by Scottish members in Parliament.(b) Although the proposed legislation gave the Minister of-Works power to make agreements for the production of materials,components and complete houses, it gave him no power himself toundertake the production of these items. It seemed desirable thatthe Minister should have this power.(c) The Minister of Works explained that it might be necessaryto extend the. power to make production agreements and to purchase and resell materials, components and fittings so as to cover therequirements of building in general and not merely those of housing.(d) It seemed likely that a sum of  25,000,000 would berequired to set up a revolving fund to finance these operations bythe Ministry of Works. Most, if not all, of this expenditure shouldbe recoverable.The War Cabinet-(1) Authorised the early introduction of legislation on the lines indicated in W.P. (45) 266, and invited the Minister ofWorks to submit the draft of the Bill to the legislation committee.(2) Asked the Minister of Works to consider whether he shouldtake power in the Bill to manufacture himself housesor materials, component parts and fittings required for houses.(3) Invited the Minister of Works, in the light of the discus-sion, to consult further with the Secretary of State for
Scotland with regard to the suggestion that the proposedpower of the Minister of Works to develop, localauthority sites and erect houses on them should not applyto Scotland.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (45) 230) recom-mending that, in the interests of our export trade and post-warcommercial connections, we should now permit the export to Spainof articles which were hot purely war material and, in particular,of certain articles of a semi-military character specified in the annex to the Memorandum.The Minister of State said that, in the view of the ForeignOffice, the time had come for some relaxation of the rules restricting the export of such goods to Spain. Even if we pursued a self-denying policy it was likely that the United States would supplymaterial of this type. There was no question of supplying strictly military material, but material. and equipment which might beregarded as having a somewhat military character should, hethought, be permitted for export in the terms of the formula setout in paragraph 6 of W.P. (45) 230. Under this formula it wouldbe possible to supply the articles of a semi-military character forwhich approaches had been made by Spain, but not the A.A. guns-and Bren carriers for which they had asked.In discussion, the proposals of the Foreign Secretary weresupported in the interest of our post-war trade, the &quot;disposal of surplus military equipment, and the restoration of favourable trade balance between Spain and this country. We had reason to thinkthat the United States were already making arrangements for supply, and it was undesirable that the market should pass to them.In particular, in the case of trainer aircraft, the Minister for CivilAviation was anxious that we should establish ourselves in Spain.The total amount of trade involved was unlikely to exceed 1 million.On the other hand, it was strongly urged that action on theselines would expose us to grave risk of misrepresentation, and thatthe political dangers involved more than outweighed the commercialarguments on the other side.After discussion, the Prime Minister suggested that, in thefirst instance, the Foreign Office should, without indicating our attitude, ask the United States Government what view. they tookof this matter, and should propose that the two countries should pursue a common policy. If the United States Government repliedthat they saw no objection to the supply of this material to Spain,we should be in a stronger position to meet any subsequent criticismfor having ourselves supplied such material. If, on the other hand,they shared our doubts, both countries might agree to refrain fromsupplying such material to Spain: -The War Cabinet-Endorsed the view expressed by the Prime Minister, as summarised at &quot;X&quot; above, and invited the Minister ofState to arrange for the necessary approach to be made tothe United States Government.
policy towards-Slam.    \(previous reference:W.M. (45)21stConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (45) 249) on policy towards Siam. &apos;The discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The Future 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theof Tangier. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (45) 236) on the futureof the Tangier Zone of Morocco. The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs proposed, if the suggestions put forward in his memorandum were approved, to open discussions in the first instancewith the United States Government and, when broad agreement hadbeen reached, to join With them in discussion with the FrenchGovernment with a view to (i) a joint communication to the Spanish Government, on theconclusion of hostilities in Europe; to lead up to(ii) agreement on the modifications to be made to the existingTangier statute before the latter was reintroduced tocover the interim period pending the conclusion of afresh treaty; and(iii) the summoning of an international conference to determine the final form which the regime should take.It was not proposed that the Soviet Government should be invitedto participate in the future regime for the administration of theTangier Zone, since they had never taken any interest in the area;but they would be informed at the appropriate moment of what wehad in mind.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals outlined in W.P. (45) 236 and invited the Minister of State to arrange for the necessary action to be taken.Press.Tass Agency&apos;request forAccreditingof AndrewRothsteinto S.H.A.E.F.as a WarCorrespondent.(previous reference:W.M.(45)33rdConclusions,Minute 6.)7. At their meeting on the 19th March the War Cabinet had invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for War toconsider what arrangements could be made for Mr. Rothstein toproceed to Belgium as the representative of the Tass Agency, con-sistently with the decision that the Daily Worker should not beallowed to have accredited correspondents with His Majesty&apos;forces. .The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum(W.P. (45) 238), in which the Home Secretary and the Secretary ofState for War recommended that Mr. Rothstein should be allowedto proceed to Belgium as the civilian representative of the TassAgency; and suggested that, if the Daily Worker should ask to beallowed to send a civilian correspondent to Brussels under a similar arrangement, no objection need be raised. At the time of the earlier discussion in the War Cabinet the facilities available for the trans-mission of messages by civilian correspondents had been far fromsatisfactory; and it had been thought that for this reason it would be insufficient to give Mr. Rothstein the status of a civiliancorrespondent. Since then, however, there had been a mai*kedimprovement in the facilities available to civilian correspondents,and it was felt that the solution suggested was no longer open to objection on this ground.The Minister of Information still felt that it was difficult to deny Mr. Rothstein the status and facilities of a war correspondent.Mr. Rothstein had in the past been given facilities by the service departments to visit military installations in this country and was
a journalist of standing and reputation; it would be difficult toexplain to him or to the Soviet Government why he could not begiven similar facilities in Belgium.As against this, it was pointed out that, if Mr, Rothstein were allowed to proceed to Belgium as an accredited war correspondent, itwould be difficult to maintain the decision of the War Cabinet thatthe Daily Worker should not be allowed to have accredited corres-coorespondents with His Majesty&apos;s Forces.The War Cabinet-Agreed that Mr. Rothstein should be allowed to proceed to belgium as a civilian correspondent of the Tass Agency, asproposed in W.P. (45) 238.Payment of 8.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the WarPostage on Cabinet that on the 27th March the question of the facilities affordedCorrespon- to Ministers for franking mail had been raised in the House ofdenoe of Commons, and Mr. Driberg, M.P., had given notice that he wouldMinisters and  raise the matter on the adjournment.Members of.; Particulars of the present practice of Ministers had beenParliament.     obtained from Departments and showed a considerable diversity.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that some general rulingwould have to be given. He would himself welcome a decision thatreplies to letters addressed to Ministers on matters affecting their departments (whether or not from their constituents) should befranked; but that Ministers should pay for the stamping of letters to constituents on essentially personal matters and also on mattersnot affecting the business of the Minister&apos;s Department.If, however, any general ruling on this matter were given, itwould bring into prominence the fact that Ministers, unlike private members, were not entitled to include postage on constituencycorrespondence as a necessary expense for tax purposes. It had beensuggested to him that a small Committee of Ministers might beappointed to consider these related issues.Discussion ensued as to the present practice in this matter andas to the issues involved.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that, inhis view, a Minister should pay for the postage of all correspondenceessentially of a private character whether or not it affected his constituency. On the other hand, he thought that the whole of a minister&apos;s correspondence which concerned the conduct of public business (whether in his own or in some other Department) oughtto be stamped at the public expense. Border-line cases would nodoubt arise, but it must be for the Minister to settle what correspon-dence did and did not concern the conduct of public business. ThePrime Minister was disposed to think that, when the matter was -raised on the Adjournment, it could be settled by a statement onthese broad lines and he would, if necessary, be prepared to speak1 himself when the matter was raised.The War Cabinet-Took note of this, statement.Ojfrdes of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,23rd April, 1945.
