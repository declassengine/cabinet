Yenezia Giulla. 1. The War Cabinet were informed of the latest developments(Previous       in connection with the military situation in Venezia Giulia.Reference:   .W.M.(45)60thConclusions.)Laval.2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled thatPierre Laval with his wife and family had recently left germany by air and had landed in Barcelona, where they had been interned.The French Government had demanded that Laval should be surrendered to them for trial. The Spanish Government, while notdesiring to retain Laval in Spain, were unwilling to surrenderhim directly to the French and claimed that this course would be inconsistent with their extradition laws. They had, however, indi-cated that they were willing to put him on board a British ship, inwhich he could be taken to the nearest French port and there handedover to the French authorities. The United States Governmentwere now pressing us to agree to this procedure.In discussion, the view was expressed that, while we should support the French in their demand that Laval should be surrender-dered to them, there was no reason why we should implicate our-selves in irregular means of securing his transfer to French custody.Nor was it reasonable that the United States Government should press us to do so. It would be preferable to deal with this situation by reference to the declared view of the Allied Governments thatneutral Governments should not afford asylum to enemy leaders and war criminals. The United States Government should be urged to join with us in bringing pressure to bear on the Spanish Govern-ment to surrender Laval direct to the French authorities.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to deal with the matter onthese lines.Prisoners ofWar.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 160thConclusions,Minute 5;)3. The War Cabinet had before, them the following papersabout the employment of German prisoners of war outside Germanyafter the end of hostilities in Europe : - W.P. (45) 292-by the Secretary of State for War.W.P. (45) 304-by   the   Minister   of   Agriculture   andFisheries.W.P. (45) 309 by the Minister of Economic Warfare.The Secretary of State for War said that the estimates putforward by Departments of their requirements for German prisoner-of-war labour totalled 730,000 for employment in the UnitedKingdom, and .150,000 for employment overseas. The number ofGerman prisoners of war in the United Kingdom at 31st March wasonly 160,000, of whom about 40,000 were employed. To meet therequirements put forward by Departments, it would be necessaryto transfer an additional 570,000 German prisoners to this country.This seemed to be quite out of the question. He therefore suggestedthat the right course was to retain the German prisoners already in this country and. put the maximum number of them to work; to import additional German prisoners to replace Italian prisoners ofwar when they were repatriated; and, for the rest, not to bring tothis country more German prisoners than could be dealt with with-out resort to billeting, the building of fresh accommodation or theretention for guard duties of any appreciable number of soldierswho might otherwise be demobilised. In selecting additionalGerman prisoners we should choose men with the required skill for[29981-6] - , t b 2
the work on which they would be employed; but, subject to this,we should employ Nazis rather than non-Nazis. The 60,000 german prisoners of war required for labour purposes in connection withthe war against Japan should be obtained, and the Dominions andIndia should be notified of our policy and asked whether they wouldrequire any additional German prisoners of war. If our Allies,other than the Russians, asked for prisoners of war to help to restore damage to their countries, we should accede to their requests.The Minister; of Labour and National Service said that he agreed that the estimates of numbers given in -Appendix A toW.P. (45) 292 were unrealistic; He felt that the first steps shouldbe to relax the present security requirements so as to reduce thenumber of guards required and enable German prisoners to beemployed on a wider range of work than agriculture and forestry.The Service Departments should make available accommodation for prisoners of war by the release of hutted camps. In particular, theAir Ministry should be able to release a good deal of suitable accom-modation in areas where there were large numbers of airfields, whichwere now only partly manned, by concentrating their establishments in a smaller number of airfields. He did not favour an immediatetransfer to this country of a large number of additional german prisoners, but thought that we should import them gradually asthe demands for their services actually materialised.In discussion, doubts were expressed as to the wisdom ofincreasing substantially the number of German prisoners of war inthis country. In particular, there seemed to be no case for bringing to this country or retaining in it any further prisoners of extremeNazi views who were not likely to do useful work and might createtrouble. Moreover, was there not a risk of unrest if german prisoners of war were employed in this country at a time when there was likely to be some unemployment among British workers,even though it was only local and, temporary ?On the other hand, it was said that to carry out the food pro-duction programme it was essential to employ German prisoners in greater numbers than had so far been authorised. The importanceof obtaining German prisoner-of-war labour for work on the pre-paration of housing sites was also stressed.The general view of the War Cabinet was that in the firstinstance every effort should be made to make the maximum useof the German prisoners of war in this country. Those prisoners ofwar now in this country who, because of their extreme Nazi views,could not easily be employed here, should be returned to Germany,where they could be put to work under more onerous conditions,suitable non-Nazi prisoners of war being brought to this countryto replace them, as opportunity arose. Plans could be made on theassumption that Italian prisoners of war would not be returnedto Italy for some months to come; and no steps should be taken for their return without further reference to the War Cabinet. the detailed arrangements should be worked out by the Inter-Depart-mental Committee on the Allocation of Prisoners of War.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows: (1) As many as possible of the German prisoners now in thiscountry should be put to work, and, with this in view,the existing limitation on the total numbers to beemployed in agriculture.and forestry was removed, andrestrictions on the conditions of employment of prisoners,both in agriculture and forestry and in other industries,should be suitably relaxed. The Inter-DepartmentalCommittee on the employment of prisoners of war should consider how the available prisoners should be distributed among the Departments who required their services.(2) German prisoners who by reason of their extreme Naziviews could not easily be put to work in the UnitedKingdom, should, so far as practicable, be returned toGermany.
Shipping. 4.   The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Secre-Indian Grain    tary of State for India (W.P. (45) 288) on wheat imports for India.Requirements. Secretary of State for India said that when in January of(Previous ^s year Government of India had undertaken to accept thew m^ITi additional economic strain arising from approved operations to beW.M. (44) 171st Dasec[ jn india) they had done so on the understanding that his conclusions, Majesty&apos;s Government would provide 70,000 tons of food grains in minute 7.)      each of the firgt four 0f i945) and would thereafter do their best to secure and transport the reasonable requirements of India for food grains on a scale sufficient to enable the Government of Indiato forestall shortages and maintain control of prices.Since then a deterioration in the internal supply situation hadreduced India&apos;s supplies by some 200,000 tons, while for shippingreasons there had been a shortfall of 190,000 tons in imports duringthe four months. The Chiefs of Staff had recorded the view thatif military requirements were to be met the necessary food grainsmust be imported, both to supply the Forces and to secure the stability of India as a base. The Government of India had nowassessed their need for loadings over the year March 1945 toFebruary 1946 at just under 1J million tons with a high rate of arrival in the critical summer months.In these circumstances he had asked the Food Grains Com-mittee for (i) a shipment of 50,000 tons as an emergency measure;(ii) loadings at the rate of 135,000 tons a month from May to August(July to October arrival), the position to be re-examined in July; and(iii) permission to make an announcement in Parliament of futureintentions in general terms. The Minister of War Transport had,however, been unable to offer more than a target figure of 65,000 to70,000 tons a month, subject to War Cabinet approval.This target figure would be quite insufficient to meet India&apos;sneeds. If wheat on the scale for which he had asked could be pro-vided, he would be ready to press India to find the additional25,000 tons of rice which the Minister of Food was anxious to secure for Ceylon, and to release in addition 200,000 tons of ground nuts;but a firm figure for wheat deliveries to India, preferably of 135,000tons for the next four months, was essential if operational demands were to be met. He trusted that, as hostilities in Europe had nowended, the Minister of War Transport would find less difficulty in meeting this demand than he had when the matter was consideredby the Food Grains Committee earlier in the month.In discussion the following points were made :-(a) There was general agreement that it was of great import-ance to secure from India 25,000 tons of rice for Ceylon, 200,000 tonsof ground nuts for the United Kingdom..(&amp;) The Minister of War Transport emphasised his difficulty in working to a firm programme, pending the outcome of the forth-coming shipping survey. Full account Had to be taken of operationaldemands and of the programme for liberated areas, and if extratonnage was to be found for India it could only be at the cost ofother claimants. Moreover, he doubted whether it would be possible(3) To replace prisoners returned to Germany, an equivalentnumber of non-Nazi prisoners should be transferred tothe United Kingdom as opportunity arose. In selectingthese prisoners, regard should be had to the type of workfor which they Were needed..(4) The Minister of Labour and National Service and the Secre-tary of State for War should make a further report tothe War Cabinet in due course, so that the question of bringing further prisoners of war to this country for employment could be reviewed in the light of the progress made in giving effect to the conclusions recorded above.
to procure at the ports for shipment any more wheat than that whichhe had already arranged to ship to Europe in the next few months.(c) The Minister of War Transport suggested that, in any event, the Indian demand for 135,000 tons per month was excessiveand a figure of 100,000 tons would meet the requirements of theGovernment of India.The Secretary of State for India said that if he could get100,000 tons a month firm over the next six months he would beprepared to insist that the Government of India should meet thedemands of Ceylon for rice and of the United Kingdom for 200,000tons of ground nuts.(d) The Secretary of State for Air felt that, in any decision,full consideration should be given to the possible effect on operations in South-East Asia Command.The Prime Minister said that the general sense of the WarCabinet was that Indians demands on the scale indicated by theSecretary of State for India (at (c) above) should be met, if possible,subject to a clear prior understanding that the Government of india should in return provide 25,000 tons of rice for Ceylon and 200,000tons of ground nuts for the United Kingdom.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the conclusion suggested by the Prime Minister,as summarised above, and agreed that a Committee con-sisting of- The Minister of Reconstruction (in the Chair),. The Secretary of State for India,The Minister of War Transport,The Minister of Food,The Paymaster-General,should work out detailed arrangements for giving practical effect to this conclusion.social insurance.national insurance(industrial injuries)Bill.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 137thConclusions,Minute 10.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of National Insurance (W.P. (45) 305) asking for authorityto introduce the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill.The War Cabinet were informed that the proposals embodied in the draft Bill differed in certain respects from those containedin Part II of the White Paper on Social Insurance (Cmd. 6551 of1944). These differences had been examined by the reconstruction committee, who had endorsed the changes embodied in the draftBill. The text of the Bill had been approved by the legislation committee.If authority were given for the introduction of the Bill, theMinister of National Insurance proposed to present to Parliamentsimultaneously a White Paper (the draft of which was annexed toW.P. (45) 305) explaining how the proposals in the Bill differed from those in the White Paper on the Industrial Injuries Scheme(Cmd. 6551), and how they were related to the proposals in thegeneral scheme of Social Insurance (Cmd. 6550).The War Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of National Insurance to proceedwith the introduction of the National Insurance (industrial injuries) Bill and the simultaneous presentation of a white paper on the Bill in the terms of the draft annexed toW.P. (45) 305.
Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,18 *A May, 1945.Man-Power. 6.   The Minister of Labour and National Service said that In response-allocation his statement in the House of Commons on the 16th May he hadbetween explained the stages by which he proposed to bring into effect the civilian arrangements for the re-distribution of man-power between civilianEmployments, employments following the end of hostilities in Europe, and had(Previous       indicated that this process of re-distribution would begin without reference:      delay.  The plans which he had announced conformed in all respectsW.M.(45)42nd&quot; with the scheme set out in the White Paper on Re-allocation of Man-Conclusions,    Power between Civilian Employments (Cmd. 6568 of 1944).    to minute 2.)      operate these plans it would be necessary to replace the existing provisions for the control of engagements by a single Control of engagement Order covering all employments; and he had indicatedin his statement that this new Order would be made during the nextfew days.  He asked for the authority of the War Cabinet to pro-ceed at once with the making of this Order.The War Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Labour and National service to proceed forthwith with the making of a new Control of engagement Order on the lines indicated in paragraph 34of Cmd. 6568.
