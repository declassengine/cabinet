Lord Wavell and Sir Firoz Khan Noon.The War Cabinet reviewed the general world situation. A.full record of the statements made is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M.(45)36thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bomber Command had flown 1,900 sorties and dropped5,900 tons of bombs. Their targets had included communications,oil centres and U-boat yards. Mosquitoes had attacked Berlin onfive nights.United States bombers had flown 4,800 sorties and dropped9,500 tons of bombs.   Their targets had included oil plants, tankAir Operations, factories and railway centres.During the month of March the R.A.F. and the United states air Force had dropped 206,000 tons of bombs on Germany roughlythree times the total tonnage of explosives of all kinds dropped onthis country during the whole of the war.An estimate has been made by experts of the results of continuedair attacks on enemy oil plants during the past ten months. Fromthis it appeared that on the 27th. March German production of oil.was only 11^ per cent, (and of petrol only 5 per cent.) of what it hadbeen in April 1944. Since December 1944, production had never been sufficient to meet the absolute minimum needs for prosecutingthe war : stocks were now exhausted : and the estimated petrolproduction at the 27th March was less than one-fifth of the minimumneeds.The Tactical Air Force had flown 23,000 sorties. Attacks hadconcentrated on enemy transport, of which very large numbers were claimed to have been destroyed.Total Allied losses for the week had been 34 bombers, 146fighters and 7 Coastal Command aircraft. Enemy losses amountedto 215 aircraft.In the Mediterranean, 3,000 sorties had been flown and 5,000tons of bombs dropped. Targets included railways behind theenemy lines facing the Russian front in Austria.Shore-based aircraft had supported Allied operations in the philippines. American aircraft had attacked a convoy north-eastpf Quinhon, sinking 35,000 tons of merchant shipping and some,000 tons of escort vessels. Super Fortresses had again attackedaircraft factories at Nagoya.- Confirmed shipping losses for the week, due to enemy action,had been 2,751 tons. The confirmed shipping losses for March now amounted to 87,367 tons.The total U-boat losses for March had been 4 sunk, 6 probably sunk and 7 promising attacks. 4 midget submarines had been sunk and 2 possibly sunk.A convoy of 26 ships had arrived at United Kingdom ports from north Russia without loss.Throughout the week operations on a large scale had been inprogress against the Loochoo Islands.   The United States Fleethad operated against the northern groups of these islands whilethe British Pacific Fleet had attacked the southern group.   Onthe 31st March the British Fleet, in resumed operations, had receivedsome damage from attacks by enemy aircraft.   The United StatesFleet, in addition to carrying out heavy attacks on the northernLoochoo Islands, had operated against airfields in Japan. Landingshad been made on a group of small islands to the west of Okinawa,and on the 1st April an assault on Okinawa Island itself hadcommenced. During these operations considerable&quot; damage to enemy shipping and aircraft was claimed.[29860-1]    ^ B2Mediterranean.Pacific.naval operations.Pacific.
MilitaryOperations.Eussia.Burma.Pacific.East of the Rhine United States and British forces had made an average penetration of some 90 to 100 miles on a 200 mile front.The enemy forces in the Ruhr were now encircled, and attempts bythe 17 weak German divisions in this area to break out had beenheld. Prisoners had been taken at the rate of 15,000 to 20,000a day. Allied casualties had been light. Excluding the airbornedivisions (for which final figures were not yet available), Britishand Canadian casualties amounted to 3,191 and American casualties to 6,900.The riain Russian advance had been in the direction of Vienna.Russian forces had now cleared the whole of Hungary and had crossed the Austrian frontier. Glogau had been captured : and inthis area Breslau was now the only stronghold holding out behind the Russian lines. In the Danzig and Gdynia area the Russiansclaimed some 120,000 Germans killed and 90,000 taken prisoner.In Burma considerable progress had been made during theprevious week. Taungup was likely to be captured shortly. Southof Mandalay our forces had consolidated their positions down toMeiktila. North east of Mandalay they had advanced towards theroad to Lashio.The landing on Okinawa was making very good progress.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.Attacks by rockets and flying-Bombs.(previous reference:W.M.(45)36thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Home Secretary and Minister of, Home security informed the War Cabinet that during the previous week there hadbeen only 11 incidents due to long-range rockets-7 in London and4 in Essex. Casualties had been 137 killed, 111 seriously injured,87 slightly injured and 2 missing. Almost all of these casualties had resulted from a single serious incident in London.Of 45 flying-bombs launched during the period, 17 had crossed the coast and 4 had reached the London area. 32 had been destroyedby gunfire and 1 by fighters.There had been no enemy attack on this country since, the29th March; but the attack might be renewed in one form.or another,and it was important that no suggestion should be made publicly that this danger was now over.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.-rreimunaryHistories.4.   The War Cabinet had before them-(i) a Memorandum by the Minister of Education (W.P. (45)14) outlining a scheme for preliminary official histories ofthe war;(ii) a Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council(W.P. (45) 15) submitting - proposals for a popularaccount of British scientific war work.The Minister of Education explained that the object in publishing these preliminary histories was to meet the demand fora record of Britain&apos;s war effort as soon as possible after the endof the war in Europe. The scheme outlined in W.P. (45) 14 was designed to give a general preliminary conspectus of naval, militaryand air operations, and also of the civil war effort. In the&apos;; campaign volumes&apos;&apos; attention would be paid to the part played by all three Services, and inter-Service co-operation would be dulystressed.The Lord President of the Council said that the main objectof the proposed popular account of British scientific war work was to make available to the public accurate information about the contribution made by British scientists to the war effort. Other-wise British scientists might fail to get the credit to which they
- 8241 W.M. 39 (45).were entitled. This popular account would be without prejudice to the work in hand in preparing authoritative records of scientificwork done during the war; Arrangements had been made forco-ordination with Dominion Governments, through the proposedBritish Commonwealth Committee on the publication of scientificwar work. It was proposed that Professor Whiddington and dr. Crowther should collaborate in preparing this popular account.Points in discussion were(a) Co-operation with the Dominions. &apos;The War Cabinet were      ,informed that the Dominion Governments had been informed insome detail of our plans for compiling official histories of the war,but the details of the proposed preliminary histories had not yetbeen formally communicated to them.   Particulars were given ofthe preparations which were being made for histories of theDominion war effort: The Prime Minister stressed the importanceof close co-operation in this matter.(b) Publication of despatches of C ommanders-in-Chief --&quot;ThePrime Minister said that he thought that a start could be made withpublishing these despatches as soon as the war with Germany was over.(c) Popular account of British Scientific War Work. the paymaster-General said that he was in favour of proceeding withthe proposed volume. But care must be taken to ensure that it was so written as not to arouse controversies as to priority of our Britishinventions, as compared with those of our Allies.The Chancellor, of the Exchequer said that arrangements hadbeen made with the United States for certain information on Radarto be published in advance of the proposed popular account ofBritish scientific war work. The Minister of Production had asked -him to say that the Radio Board would like to be consulted aboutthe section of the proposed volume dealing with Radar.The War Cabinet-Gave approval in principle to the schemes set out in w.P. (45) 14 and 15, points of detail being left fordiscussion between the Ministers concerned.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,3rd April, 1945.
