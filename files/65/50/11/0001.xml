Building 1.   The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theX.abotuf Minister of Production (W.P. (45) 223) proposing allocations ofAllocations      building labour for the period April to June 1945.April- . It was explained that the allocations had been made on the june 1945. assumption that war conditions would continue until at least the(Previous end of June 1945, and took no account of the review of man-powerReference- which was being carried out under the Prime Ministers recentWM.(45)l9th directive (W.P. 1(45) 250) or of the plans for increasing the buildingConclusions, labour force by accelerating releases under the demobilisationMinutes.)      scheme. . : -Discussion turned on the question whether it would not bepossible to make more labour available for housing by reducing the allocations for other purposes; and, in (particular, whether thereshould not be a substantial cut in the allocations to the service departments.The following were the main points made in discussion : (a) Admiralty. It was urged that at this stage of the war itwas difficult to justify any allocation of labour for new works.The First Lord of the A dmiralty explained that, even allowing for the maximum use of airfields released by the Royal Air Force,the Admiralty would need to complete a number of new airfieldsfor the Fleet Air Arm. Secondly, building work was required toenable the Admiralty to vacate schools and colleges now used fortraining establishments. Thirdly, concrete barges and floatingdocks had to &quot;be constructed for the assault forces in the Far East.It should be borne in mind that the Admiralty allocation includedtheir requirements as a Supply Department as well as a service department.(b) War Office.-The War Office had asked for only 3,000 men for new works, and the remainder were required for maintenance dfthe accommodation which the War Office had to maintain in thiscountry for 600,000 men in base installations and training estab-. lishments, together with about 320,000 prisoners and 434,000 UnitedStates troops. A review was in progress to determine whether anyof it Could be dispensed with.(c) Air Ministry. The allocation of labour to the Air ministry was required almost entirely for maintenance. Concrete runwaysneeded constant repair; and the Air Ministry were also responsiblefor the maintenance of the accommodation occupied by some 450,000men in the United States Air Force.(d) Ministry of Supply. The building labour force of theMinistry of Supply had been severely cut in order to supply men forwar damage repairs in London, and if any further cuts were madethe work of reconverting factories to civilian production would be seriously held up. So far as new works were concerned, these were only undertaken to meet essential needs, such as premises for theproduction of penicillin.(e) Ministry of War Transport. The labour required would beemployed mainly on maintenance and on certain small works of road improvement.. The labour force employed on road works hadbeen very severely cut during the war and a start must now be madein overtaking the arrears. Proposals for the use of prisoner of warlabour on road works were being considered.(f) Ministry of IleaZth-The allocation for hospitals should be reviewed,^particularly since the amount of hospital accommodationprovided for casualties had proved to be in excess of needs.(g) Ministry-of Works-This allocation of 17,000, much ofwhich was required for the maintenance of Government offices,should be reviewed.Summing up the discussion, The Prime ministers aid that from. now on the demands of the Service Departments must be subjected to the closest scrutiny. In view of the urgent need to provide labour for housing and the reconversion,of industry, new work should notbe undertaken by the Service Departments save in the most excep-tional circumstances, and the standard of maintenance work in the[29935-Hl] B 2
Services should, also be reviewed. No change could now be made inthe allocations for the months of April and May; and in view ofthe prospect of an early end to the European war it was doubtfulwhether anything would be gained by seeking at this stage to makeallocations for any period beyond the 31st July. He proposed, how-ever, that new allocations should be framed for June and July, withthe aim of reducing to 50,000 the building force working for theService Departments at the end of July. Corresponding reductions should be sought in the allocations for civil work of low priorityfrom the point of view of peace-time needs. The whole of the labourfreed by these reductions should be transferred to housing work.The War Cabinet (1) Approved the allocations of building labour for the monthsof April and May set out in Statement II appended toW.P. (45) 223.(2) Invited the Minister of Production, in the light of the dis-cussion, to submit revised allocations for the month ofJune, together with allocations for the month of July,designed to give effect to the proposals made by thePrime Minister as summarised above.Coal. 2.   At their meeting on the 12th April the War Cabinet hadRelease of appointed a Ministerial Committee to report on the possibility of miners from arranging, within the principles of the demobilisation scheme, forthe Armed the return as soon as possible after the end of the German war of forces. the largest possible number of experienced miners still in the Armed(Previous Forces.Reference: The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theW.M.(45)42nd Minister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (45) 257) embodyingConclusions, the Report of this Committee; and a Note by the Minister of FuelMinute 3.) and Power (W.P. (45) 262) commenting on the Committee&apos;s Report.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that his committee had been forced to the conclusion that the only means ofincreasing the number of miners to be released from the Forces inthe period up to mid-October would be by accelerating the releases in Class A during this period. Under favourable conditions itmight be possible to increase the number of those released from thepresent estimate of 150,000 up to 200,000. This would have theeffect of increasing the number of underground coal-miners released in Class A from 4,500 to 6,000. Further, it would make it possibleto increase the number of Class B releases by 5,000, one half ofwhich should be underground coal-miners and the remainder- building workers. By these means a total of 8,500 miners would besupplied from the Army; and a small additional number would bemade available by applying the same principles to releases fromthe Royal Air Force. These measures, together with the release of miners from other industries, should provide a total increase of10,000 underground miners as against an estimated need of 20,000.The Secretary of State for War emphasised that the figure of200,000 for releases in Class A was not a firm estimate, but a target figure. The question whether this target could be reached depended on decisions yet to be taken about the scale of redeployment for theJapanese war. This was a further reason why early decisions should be reached on the scale of our future operations in the far east.The Prime Minister expressed the view that it should bepossible to bring back to this country from European theatres ofwar, within the first three months after the beginning of the-demobilisation process, about 300,000 men, of whom perhaps 250,000&apos;would be available for release. The Secretary of State for Warsaid that, while he would of course do all that he could to achieve this figure, he doubted whether it would prove possible to releaseso large a number within this period, unless there was a substantial
reduction in present estimates of the scale of redeployment against japan.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that on the basis of theestimates given in W.P. (45) 257 the number of underground coal-miners to be released by the measures there recommended would be only half the total required to balance the coal budget for thecoming year. The resulting short-fall in production would havethe result that domestic consumers would receive about 30 per cent,less house coal  than they had used in 1942. This was likely to have serious effects on public morale during the coming winter. If4 onthe other hand, the Prime Minister&apos;s estimate of releases Wererealised, the consequential increase in the labour force of the coal-mining industry would go some way towards giving a productionof coal sufficient to meet the estimated demand in the coming coalyear.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for War and the Secretaryof State for Air to take steps to secure the maximum possible acceleration in Class A releases during the first three months after the beginning of the demobilisationprocess. The target figure for releases from the Armyduring this period should be of the order of 250,000.The precise figure should be determined after the scale of deployment for the war in the Ear East had been settled by the Defence Committee.(2) Agreed that, in so far as it was found possible to increasereleases in Class A, there should be a proportionate increase in Class B releases, half of which would consistof underground coal-miners and half of building workers.3. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theMinister of Health (W.P. (45) 234) covering the draft of a Billdesigned to accelerate the acquisition by local authorities of sitesin parks and open spaces for temporary houses.It was explained that under the existing law the use of public:open spaces for temporary houses, without the provision of other land in compensation, could be authorised only by provisional order. The draft Bin provided an expedited procedure, whichwould operate for a period of two years, enabling the health ministers to authorise local authorities to use for temporary housesan open space vested in them, provided that the appropriatePlanning Minister certified that such a use was expedient in thepublic interest.These proposals were put forward to meet the difficulties which local authorities were encountering in finding sites for temporary houses in areas (e.g-, London, Manchester and Birmingham) wherethere had been much bomb damage and little undeveloped land was available. In view of the urgency of finding sites for temporary houses the Bill should he introduced as soon as possible.In discussion it was pointed out that, having regard to thepurposes of the Bill, the wording of the definition of &quot; open space &quot;in Clause 1 (8) of the draft was somewhat unfortunate, particularlyin its reference to land &quot; used for the purposes of public recreational-tion.&quot; This definition was taken from measures designed for theprotection of open spaces. The Minister of Health undertook to reconsider the wording of this definition.The War Cabinet-Authorised the early introduction of legislation on thelines of the draft Bill annexed to W.P. (45) 234, and invited the Minister of Health to submit the draft Billfor detailed examination by the Legislation Committee.Housing.Use of parks and open spaces asSites forTemporaryHouses.(previous reference:W.M.(45)31stConclusions,Minute 1.)[29935-4]
livestockPolicy.Measures forIncreasingHomeProduction of pork, bacon and Eggs.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the PrimeMinister (W.P. (45) 252) covering a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries, the Minister of War Transport andthe Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food on the meansof increasing the home production of pork, bacon and eggsThe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries estimated that,given an increase in the supplies of feeding-stuffs for pigs and poultry of 520,000 tons (including 470,000 tons of cereals) in theperiod May to December 1945 and - 1,600,000 tons (including,460,000 tons of cereals) in 1946 and subsequent years, it wouldbe possible to increase the production of pork or bacon by 75,000 tonsin 1946 and 110,000 tons in 1947, and the production of eggs by500 million in 1946 and 1,000 million in 1947. The Minister of .War Transport believed that in the two or three months immediately following VE-day he could load an additional 300,000 tons ofcereals, and he would hope to be able to ship substantial quantitiesin 1946. The increased import of cereals would mean an additionalblocked sterling or foreign exchange commitment of from  2 to 31 million. Of the balance of 170,000 tons of cereals required,part might be obtained from increased home production and theremainder would have to be drawn from our wheat stocks. these should be restored to a level of 1,200,000 tons by the end of July;and, on that assumption and provided the war in Europe was overbefore that date, the Minister of Food would be prepared to drawon wheat stocks up to a maximum of 170,000 tons. It would alsobe necessary to provide labour for processing and distributing theadditional feeding-stuffs.In discussion attention was drawn to the fact that in the period immediately after VE-day shipping would be required, not only for redeployment and demobilisation, but also for the movement of cargo in connection with operations in the Far East. Pending thecompletion of the forthcoming review of cargo shipping, agreement had not yet been reached between the Service Departments and theMinister of War Transport on the amount of shipping to beprovided for the latter purpose. In these circumstances was it wisefor the Government to enter into a shipping commitment for thetransport of 300,000 tons of cereals unless an assurance could begiven that this would not prejudice the operational needs of theServices ? This point was of particular importance in view of thetendency of the American Chiefs of Staff to seek to establish an absolute priority for shipping for operations against Japan. Itwas also pointed out that once an announcement had been madewe should be committed, not merely to providing the importsproposed for 1945, but also to maintaining imports at the figuresindicated in paragraph 5 of the memorandum during 1946, whenthe amount of shipping likely to be available could not be foreseen.The Minister of War Transport said that the proposals in w.P. (45) 252 would not interfere in any way with the movementof troops to and from the Far East. With regard to cargo, therequirements for the Far Eastern War had not yet been defined,but he saw no reason to doubt that it would be possible to meet these requirements as well as provide for the additional imports of cerealsproposed for 1945. It was true that the position in 1946 could notbe accurately foreseen and that the demands for shipping byliberated countries would necessarily be higher then. On the otherhand, the release of tonnage now locked up in Swedish and Balticports should ease the shipping position generally.1   The War Cabinet- -Approved the proposals outlined in W.P. (45) 252 for increasing the home production of pork, bacon and eggs and authorised the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries to make an immediate announcement of the governments intention to increase rations to pigs and poultry and tomaintain them at the higher level proposed
5. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (45) 211) and the Minister of fuel and Power (W.P. (45) 237) regarding a proposal to apply control of Employment Order to the whole of the non-industrial civil service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was a serious danger that, as the war in Europe drew to an end, temporary civilservants would resign in large numbers in order to take up outsideemployment. This would cause grave difficulties for departments which depended largely on temporary staff. Moreover, it would be unfair to men and women in the Forces and other forms of war service if temporary civil servants could get this start in estab-lishing themselves in peace-time employment. The Lord presidents committee had considered the problem very fully and had reachedthe conclusion that the only solution was to apply a Control ofEmployment Order to the whole of the non-industrial civil service.This would mean that no civil servant could leave his employment without the consent of the employing Department, subject to anappeal to one of the tribunals of the Ministry of Labour and national Service.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, while he agreed that steps must be taken to prevent an uncontrolled exodus of temporarystaffs, the proposed Order might give rise to considerable hardshipunless it,were applied with sympathy and discretion.Other points in discussion were (a) It might be unreasonable to apply the Order to all civil ser-vants up to the age of 60, since officers of over 50 who might beemployed on similar work in the Armed Forces would be entitledto release. It was, however, always possible to retain in the Forcesofficers over the age of 50 on grounds of military necessity.(b) The Admiralty and the War Office had felt difficulties aboutthe original proposal, which would have involved separate negotia-tions with the staffs in each of their many establishments withregard to their conditions of service. Under the new proposal, how-ever, which applied to non-industrial staffs as a whole, this diffi-culty did not arise.(c) Attention was drawn to the importance of accelerating therelease of women, particularly elderly women, both from the civilservice and from the Armed Forces after VE-Day.It was explained that considerable numbers of women wouldhave to be retained since they were employed on work in connectionwith the demobilisation scheme. The Service Departments were,however, alive to the importance of releasing women as soon aspossible and would keep the numbers of women in the auxiliary services under constant review.&apos; The War Cabinet-   -Approved the proposal in W.P. (45) 211 to apply a Controlof Employment Order to the whole non-industrial civilservice, including established civil servants, on the under -, standing that in the operation of the Order every effort would be made to avoid hardship to individuals.Civil Service.Control ofEmployment(CivilServants)Order.Transfer of warships to canada and australia.EoyalCanadianNavy.(previous reference erence:W.M. (44) 174thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (45) 193 and 260) regarding thetransfer of (i) a flotilla of fleet destroyers and two light fleet carriersto the Eoyal Canadian Navy; and (ii) two cruisers and a light fleetcarrier to the Royal Australian Navy.It had originally been proposed that the warships should betransferred to the Royal Canadian Navy on loan, with the stipula-tion that they should remain under Admiralty operational control.The Canadian Government had since indicated that they would accept the offer only on the understanding that Canada would havethe right to buy the light fleet carriers at a later date, and that theemployment of all the ships would be restricted to the Pacific.   It
was now suggested tfaat the Canadian Government should be giventhe option ;to buy the light fleet carriers, and that both the destroyers and &apos;the carriers should operate under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, British Pacific Fleet until the send of the war against japan; on the understanding that the selection of the two carriersto be transferred and detailed arrangements for their despatch tothe Pacific would be &quot;worked out by the Canadian naval authorities.    and the Admiralty.It was ^pointed out, in support of the proposal to give the Cana-dian Government an option to purchase the fleet carriers, that theCanadian Government might find it convenient to have available thismeans of putting dollars at our disposal in a way which would notexpose them to criticism in the Canadian Parliament.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals set out in W.P. (45) 193 for thetransfer of warships to the Royal Canadian Navy.Royal -    The proposed transfer of warships to Australia would easeAustralian the Royal Navy&apos;s manning problem during the difficult periodNavy. following the end of the German war and would provide a founda-tion for the post-war Australian fleet. It would be stipulated thatany vessels transferred should operate tinder the operational orders of the Commander-in-Chief, British Pacific Fleet, until the end ofthe war against Japan.The Australian Government had asked that the ships should be handed over free of charge. Australia had, however, accumulatedconsiderable sterling balances in the course of the war, and theAustralian Government seemed likely to insist on the payment of nearly 100 per cent, of the cost of the services which they wereundertaking on behalf of the Royal Navy. In these circumstances there was a strong case for seeking reimbursement for the transfer,either by asking payment for the ships or by inviting the Australian. Government to reduce their charges for the naval facilities whichthey were providing for the Royal Navy.The War Cabinet  ;(2) Approved the proposals set out in W.P. (45)260 for thetransfer of warships to the Royal Australian Navy, onthe understanding it would be made clear that HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom found itnecessary to ask for reimbursement for the value of theships.- (3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the First LordOf the Admiralty to consider what form this reimburse-ment could best take, and to arrange with the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs for a suitable communica-tion to be made to the Australian Government.CompulsoryMilitaryService.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 141stConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum (W.P.(45) 242)on compulsory military service by the Lord President of the Council,as Chairman of the Armistice and Post-war Committee.The discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded inthe Secretary^ Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet were informed that the Polish Govern-Celebration ment in-London had enquired whether a member of the War cabinet of Polish would be prepared to speak at the celebration of the Polish NationalNational Day on the 3rd May.Day. It was recalled that a War Cabinet Minister had attended the(Previous celebration in previous years, and it might be thought significantReference: if this precedent were not followed on this occasion.  On the otherW.M.(44)48th hand, it was unfortunate that this special gesture towards theConclusions, Polish Government in London should have to be made at the presentMinute 2.) critical stage of the discussions on the reconstitution of the Govern-ment of Poland.The Prime Minister, after a short discussion, said that weshould maintain our recognition of the Polish Government inLondon until the Government in Poland had been reconstituted inaccordance with the conclusions of the Crimea Conference. Unless, -therefore, the situation in Poland had changed meanwhile, the better course would be to follow the precedent of recent years. he proposed that the Minister of State should attend this celebrationon behalf of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the Prime Ministers proposal.48Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,20th April, 1945.
