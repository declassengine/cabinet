255W.M. m -(46).Man-power.Allocationsfor 1945.(previous reference:W,M.(45)24thConclusions,Minute 1.) &apos;1. The War Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer : W.P. (45) 207-recommending that the man-power allo-catiOns for the first half of 1945 proposed by the ministerial committee on Man-power should be formally approved as thebasis for executive action; and.W.P; (45) 232-explaining the effect on Service intakesand on the labour force in munitions of the new assumptionabout the end of the German war set out in paragraph 3 of w.P. (45) 207.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped theWar Cabinet would approve the allocations for the first six monthsof 1945 set out in the Appendix to W.P. (45) 207. As explained in paragraph 3 of W.P. (45) 207, the Prime Minister had sinceasked the Man-power Committee to prepare further plans on theassumption that the European War would end not later than the31st May, 1945, but bearing in mind the possibility of an earlieror later ending. The report annexed to W.P. (45) 232 described the administrative steps which were being taken to reduce munitionsprogrammes in the light of this new assumption. These wouldresult in some additional releases from munitions; but further large-scale reductions could not be expected until planning could be related to a firm date for the end of the German war. It would be ofgreat assistance to the Man-power Committee, in consideringallocations for the second half of 1945, if such a date could now begiven without reservations.The Prime Minister said that, after consulting the Chiefs ofStaff, he was prepared to take the responsibility for recommendingto the War Cabinet that plans should now be made on the assumptionthat organised resistance by Germany would end by the 31st May,1945. This was hot a forecast that all fighting in Europe wouidbe over by that date; and no public statement should be made whichimplied that we were proceeding on this assumption. But he was satisfied that this date should now be taken for the purposes ofman-power allocations and the planning of munitions programmes.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the man-power allocations for the first half of1945 set out in the Appendix to W.P. (45) 207.(2) Took note with approval of the administrative measuresdescribed in the report annexed to W.P. (45) 232 forfurther reductions in munitions programmes, inaddition to those assumed in the allocations set out in w.P. (45) 207.(3) Invited the Ministerial Committee on Man-power toconsider man-power allocations for the second half of1945 on the assumption that organised resistance byGermany would end not later than the 31st May, 1945.Man-power.Re-allooationol Man-powerbetweenCivilianEmployments.(previous reference:2 The Minister of Labour and National Service pointed outthat in the White Paper on the reallocation of man-power between-Civilian employments in the interim period between the defeat olGermany and the defeat of Japan (Cmd. 6568 of 1944 the Govern-ment had indicated that the powers of control over labour wouldhave to be maintained during this period. . Though less use wouldbe made of the powers of direction, control would be exercised byother means, in particular by the Control of .Engagement Order.w.M. (44) 145th Without these controls it would be -impossible for him to give effectConclusionsMinute::.4.)to any man-power allocations approved for this period.Recent discussions about the future of the controls seemed, how-ever, to have thrown some doubt on the Governments intentionsi0r-4Q - &apos; b 2
regarding the control of labour in this interim period; and he-suggested that it would be desirable that a public statement shouldbe made on behalf of the War Cabinet re-affirmim? the policy set outin the White Paper. JThe War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service tosubmit proposals on this point. &apos;3. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the lord president of the Council (W.P. (45) 190) setting out recommenda-tions made by the, Lord Presidents Committee for expanding thelabour force in the coal-mining industry and for an increase in coal prices.The Minister of Fuel and Power explained that during the coalyear 1945-46 production of coal was likely to fall short of require-ments by 4 million tons, and that there would be a special shortageof coal for coking, gas and railways. At the beginning of thecoming winter distributed stocks would not exceed 15^ million tons as compared with 18^ million tons at the beginning of last winter.All possible expedients to increase production with the existinglabour force had been tried, and it was not reasonable to count onany further reduction in consumption. If, therefore, a breakdown in coal supplies during the forthcoming winter was to be avoided,it was essential that the labour force should be increased; and the -Lord Presidents Committee had felt they had no alternative but torecommend the early release of the 41*000 experienced miners still inthe Forces.It was urged in discussion that the release of these miners fromthe Forces before the end of the war with Germany could hot becoptemplated, and that even after the demobilisation scheme had begun to operate there would be serious risks in introducing anyspecial scheme of release for miners. It might, however, be possible at that stage to increase the numbers of miners returning from theForces to work in the mines, e.g.y by extending Class B releases tocover miners. Any such arrangements would have to be consistent with the principles of the demobilisation scheme and should be accompanied by suitable publicity in the Forces.Additional points in discussion were : (a) The Minister of Labour and National Service said-that itwould not be possible to continue recruiting &quot; Bevin Boys &quot; for the mines after the end of the German war.(b) Although transport difficulties were likely to make itimpossible for this country to obtain any coal from the Ruhr orSaar minefields, it was not contemplated that we should have to export any coal to the Continent after the end of August.(c) The Minister of Fuel and Power thought that the positionin the. coming winter would be adequately met if the desired increasein the labour force of the coal-mining industry became effective by september 1945. It was pointed out, however, that from the pointof view of transport it would be preferable that production shouldbe increased during the summer months.The War Cabinet-- &apos;(1) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service toarrange for officials of his Department, the Ministry of fuel and Power and the Service Departments to prepare a report on the possibility of arranging, within the prin-ciples of the existing scheme of demobilisation, for thereturn to the mines, as soon as possible after the endof the German war, of the largest possible number ofCoal,(previous reference:W,M.(45)20thConclusions,Minute 3.)Labour for theCoal Industry.
Relaxation ofLightingRestrictions.(previous reference:W.M.(45)26thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityrecalled that at their meeting on the 6th March the War cabinet had agreed that local authorities should be asked to prepare for full lighting at the end pf the double summer time period, namely the 15th July. He asked whether the War Cabinet wished to reconsider that decision in view of the prospective shortage of fuelreported by the Minister of Fuel and Power (See Minute 3 above).The Prime Minister s&amp;id that the general relaxation of lighting restrictions could not be deferred beyond the 15th,Julyon military grounds. There might be other considerations, e.g.,shortage of man-power or equipment, which might delay therestoration of full street-lighting.It was. however, the general view of the War Cabinet that the agreed relaxation of lighting restrictions should not be deferredon grounds of fuel shortage.257 W.M. 42 (45).&quot; &quot;experienced miners still in the Forces.   This report* should be considered by a Committee consisting of theMinister of Labour and National Service (in the Chair),the Secretary of State for War, the Minister of Supply,the Minister of War Transport and the Minister of fuel and Power, who should submit their recommenda-tions to the War Cabinet in time for them to be con-sidered before the end of the week beginning the16th April.Coal Prices. The War Cabinet then considered the proposal^ set out in para-graphs 4-5 of W,P. (45) 190, that in order to pay the accumulated deficit in the Coal Charges Account and to meet the current deficit- for 1945-46, the price of coal should be increased by 3s. Qd. p;erton from 1st May, 1945, with a corresponding increase in the priceof coke.In discussion it was urged that any such increase would have serious repercussions on production costs throughout Britishindustry, and in particular on the price of heavy steel; and it wassuggested that a decision should be deferred in the hope that theproposals for securing an increased coal output might render theincrease in price unnecessary.        -On the other hand, it was pointed out that it had been thesettled policy of the Government throughout the war that the coalindustry should pay its way; and an increase in price was the only-     , way of bringing home to the public the serious difficulties whichwere arising owing to the decline in coal output. Any improvementin output which it might be possible to make during the current year could not obviate the need for the proposed increase of price;and in these circumstances to refrain from liquidating the deficit in the Coal Charges Account would amount to giving a concealedsubsidy to the coal industry. It was important that the increase in price should-be announced at the earliest possible date in orderthat it should not have an adverse effect on the stocking of coal byconsumers during the summer. The alternative of deferring any increase of price&quot; until the end of the stocking period would operate. unfairly on the poorest classes of consumers who bought their coalin small quantities over the winter. The Lord Presidents Com-mittee had been satisfied that an increase in prices from-the1st May, 1945, was essential.The War Cabinet^(2) Agreed that the price of coal should be increased by 35. Qd.per ton as from the 1st May, 1945, and that a corres-ponding increase should be made in the price of coke.
The War Cabinet-Reaffirmed their decision that lighting authorities shouldbe asked to prepare for Ml lighting by the 15th Julyon the understanding that every encouragement wouldbe given to the exercise of economy in the use of fuel torthis purpose.Arrangementsfor Celebratingthe, End ofHostilities inEurope.(previous reference:W.M.(45)41stConclusions,Minute 6.)DoubleTaxation.ProposedAgreementwith the -&quot;United StatesGovernment(previous reference:W.M.(45)37thConclusions;Minute 3.)5. In the course of the discussion recorded in Minute 3 above,further reference was made to two points which had been touchedupon in the War Cabinefs discussion on the 9th April of thearrangements for celebrating the end of (hostilities in Europe.The first was the risk that formal celebration of the end of organised resistance by Germany might cause a dangerousrelaxation in the national effor.t required both for the war against japan and for completing our tasks in Europe. It was desirablethai; this celebration should be presented to the public, not as asignal for general relaxation of effort, but as marking a significantpoint in the progress of the war against Germany and Japan comparable to the ringing of the church bells in celebration of the victory at El Alamein. From this point of view there might be something to be said for associating this day pf celebration withthe fall of Berlin rather than with a declaration that all organised resistance by Germany was at an end.The Prime Minister said that he might take the opportunity,in the statement on the war situation which he was proposing tomake in the House of Commons on the 19th April, of puttingthese proposed celebrations into their proper perspective and making it clear that VE-day,.when it came, must not be followedby any relaxation of effort.       &quot;The second point was whether VE-day could be regarded for adminsitrative purposes as the end of the war in Europe. Thus,the Governments published proposals on the future of labour controls were related expressly to the interim period &quot; between the defeat of Germany and the defeat of Japan &quot; (Command 6568 of1944), It was most important that there should be no risk ofmisunderstanding about the date from which this modification ofthe labour controls would be introduced. Unless it were clearly stated to the contrary, people were likely to assume that these new arrangements would nave effect as from VE-day. It might wellbe necessary to distinguish between three different dates the datechosen for celebrating the successful progress of the war (whichmight be as early as the fall of Berlin); the date on which, for adminsitrative purposes, the war in Europe was regarded as at anend; and the legal date for the end of the war against Germany.The War Cabinet-^Asked that the Chairman of the Official Committee for theCo-ordination of Departmental Action on Cease Fireshould arrange for these two points to be considered and areport to be submitted for early discussion-by the WaxCabinet.6. At their meeting on the 28th March the War Cabinet had considered proposals, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer for anAgreement with the United States Government on double taxation;and had decided that, before finally authorising the Chancellor to conclude this Agreement, they should have before them suchparticulars as could be made available about the relative value ofeach country&apos;s investments in the territory of &quot;the other, theprobable effect of the Agreement on trading profits, and the amountof &quot; hot money &quot; which might be removed from London if adversely affected by the scheme. The War Cabinet had also authorised theChancellor pf the Exchequer to discuss the details of the proposed agreement with a small number of leading bankers, in confidence,in order to ascertain&apos;the views of the banking community.
259TBT.M. 42 (45)/.The War Cabinet now had before them a further Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (45) 235) giving theestimates, for which the War. Cabinet had asked, Of the probable effects of the Agreement; and a Memorandum by the Minister of. Information (W.P.-(45) 216) commenting on certain aspects of theproposed Agreement. &quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had, as desired,held confidential discussions with representatives of the Committeeof the Clearing Banks and had received from them an assurance that the Agreement would be accepted by the banking community.There had, of course, never been any doubt that the agreement would be warmly welcomed by traders. t &quot; &apos;.In the light of this further information, the War Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the-Exchequer to proceedwith the conclusion of the Anglo-American Agreement ondouble taxation described in W.P. (45) 1 and 189.International 7.   The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum on this subjectAspects of      by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (45) 228).Colonial At their meeting on the 3rd April, the War Cabinet had takenPolicy. the it would be proper to argue at San Francisco that, as(Previous it would be clearly within the powers of the new World OrganisationEeference: to arrange for a mandatory system to be applied to territoriesW.M.(45)38th voluntarily placed under trusteeship, there was no reason to makeConclusions, specific provision to this effect. It was thought that, if suchMinute 1.)      provision Were made, we should have to- make an immediatedeclaration that we did not intend to use it in respect of anyterritories under our control. .At the Commonwealth Meeting the representatives of Australiaand New Zealand had, however, argued strongly in favour of a specific provision, and had also urged that the United KingdomGovernment should take the lead in placing our colonies under some measure of trusteeship.* It   was   suggested   in   the  Memorandum   that   in   thesecircumstances (a) we should tell the Dominion representatives that there couldbe no question of our agreeing to place under any formof trusteeship any of our colonial territories other thanthose at present administered under mandate; but(6) having regard to&apos;-the-view which the Dominion representa-tives had expressed, it was for consideration whether weshould refrain from arguing at San Francisco againstthe inclusion of a specific provision enabling territories to be voluntarily placed under trusteeship by the parentState concerned.It was the general view of the War Cabinet that there couldbe no question of our agreeing to place under any form of inter-national trusteeship any of our Colonial territories, other thanthose now administered under mandate, and that this should bemade clear beyond question to the Dominion representatives.As regards the line to be taken at San Francisco, The PrimeMinister thought that the great Colonial Powers .such as Franceand the Netherlands would certainly object to arrangements for placing their Colonies under voluntary trusteeship; and that as amatter of tactics we should be well advised to let them take the leadin this matter and then lend our support to their arguments. Hewould see no strong objection to allowing Australia and New. Zealand to press their own point of view, if they so desired, while making it clear that we did not share it. In the light, however, ofthe discussions at the Commonwealth Meeting, there seemed to beno strong ground for our taking the initiative in opposing theinclusion of specific provision for territories to be voluntarily placed
under trusteeship, provided that it was made clear that HiMajesty s Government in the United Kingdom had no intentionof applying such a provision to any of our Colonial territories otherthan those now administered under mandate.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the views expressed by the Prime Minister.8. The War Cabinet were informed that the CommunistParty of Great Britain had elected Mr. Harry Pollitt as theirdelegate to the Conference of the Communist Party of Finland.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that no special facilities should be accorded toMr. Harry. Pollitt to enable him to travel to Finland forthe purpose of attending this Conference.Mr. HarryPollitt,Proposed visit to Finland.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,12th April, 1945.    &apos;
