The resultsof our air attack on enemy communications and oil stocks wereshown by the enemy&apos;s use of oxen for transport.

At their meeting on the 25th April the War Cabinet had agreed that, subject to the views of the Chiefs of Staff on thequestion whether further air attack on this country was to beexpected, immediate steps should be taken to begin the disband-ment of the Civil Defence Services and the Royal Observer Corps.The Chiefs of Staff had advised that the disbandment of theCivil Defence Services would now constitute no military risk. The.possibility of further attack by enemy aircraft could not, however,be entirely excluded; and there might be political difficulties if such attacks took place after the Civil Defence organisation had beenwound up. If this risk were accepted,&apos; there appeared to be noobjection to the disbandment of the Civil Defence Services.The Prime Minister said that, in the light of this report bythe Chiefs of Staff, he had informed the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security that effect might now be given to theconclusion reached by the War Cabinet on the 25th April. he understood that local authorities were being instructed to begin onthe 2nd May the disbandment of the Civil Defence Services. &quot;The War Cabinet Took note of this statement.Pay of 3.   The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theService Nurses. Secretary of State for War and Secretary of State for AirWar Service    (W.P. (45) .221), by the First Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (45) 259),Increments.     and by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (45) 251), on thequestion whether nurses in the Services should receive the war serviceincrement granted last September to the Armed Forces in general.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on this question there was a difference of opinion between himself and the service ministers which it had not been found possible to resolve without reference to the War Cabinet. The Service Ministers felt that theGovernment were committed by the terms of the White Paper(Cmd. 6553 of 1944) to grant the war service increments to Servicenurses as to other women members of the Armed Forces. He, onthe other hand, took the view that the pay of Service nurses wasrelated to that of civilian nurses; that they had benefited by the increases recommended in 1943 by Lord RushcliflVs Committee onNurses&apos; Salaries (Cmd. 6424); and that by electing&apos; to be alignedwith civilian nurses for the purposes of remuneration they hadsurrendered any claim to receive benefits which were designed for members of the Armed Forces who were remunerated on the normalService basis. The immediate cost of extending war service&apos;increments to Service nurses would be - comparatively small; but such a concession would give rise to counter-claims from civiliannurses.The Prime Minister&apos;suggested that this was a matter which need not engage the attention of the War Cabinet as a whole; andthat the Ministers concerned might be willing to submit their
differences to adjudication by a single Minister who was not concerned in the dispute. The Minister of Aircraft Productionmight undertake this duty.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would be glad toaccept this suggestion, on the understanding that it would not beregarded as a precedent for any further case of this kind whichhe might think it necessary to bring to the War Cabinet.On this understanding, the&apos; War Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Aircraft Production todetermine, on their behalf, in the light of the considerations set out in W.P. (45) 221, 251 and 259, whether Servicenurses should be regarded as eligible for war serviceincrements.4.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) a Note by the Secretary (W.P. (45) 265) covering a copyof a Minute addressed to the Prime Minister by the earl marshal on the arrangements for the State Opening ofParliament during the period before the House ofCommons Chamber was rebuilt;(ii) a Memorandum by the Postmaster-General (W.P. (45) 277)about the use of St. Stephen&apos;s Hall for the provision of postal facilities for Members of Parliament during thesame period.The Prime Minister explained that the only Chamber suitablefor the Ceremonial customary on the State Opening of parliament was that formerly used by the House of Lords and now used by theHouse of Commons. It would accordingly be necessary for theHouse of Commons to meet in some other place, from whichthey could be summoned to hear the Gracious Speech; and it was proposed that they should meet in St. Stephen&apos;s Hall, which wouldaccommodate about 300 Members. During the few days whichwould intervene between the taking of the oath by the Membersof the new House of Commons and the State Opening, the Ministryof Works would restore the Chamber at present used by the Houseof Commons to its former state and would simultaneously prepareSt. Stephen&apos;s Hall for use by the House of Commons. As soon asthe Opening of Parliament had taken place, the Chamber wouldbe rearranged for the House of Commons and it was estimated thatif Parliament were opened at 11 a.m. the House of Commons couldreturn to the premises which they now. occupied by 5 p.m. for the debate on the Address. If the War Cabinet approved these arrangements an announcement would be made in Parliament atsome suitable opportunity. It did not seem to be necessary toappoint a Select Committee to consider the matter. It would,however, be necessary to&apos; obtain the formal approval of His majesty the King.The Postmaster-General said that, as soon as the demolition of the old House of Commons Chamber and its surroundings began,the existing Members&apos; Post Office would have to be closed and itwould be necessary to provide&apos; alternative premises which mighthave to be used for four or five years. From the point of view ofthe convenience of Members and easy working by the Post office staff, by far the best arrangement would be to use the temporary accommodation which had been erected in St. Stephen&apos;s Hall. If,however, it was decided to use St. Stephen&apos;s Hall for the House ofCommons at the time of the State Opening of Parliament, it wouldbe necessary to remove this temporary accommodation, and it was difficult to see how satisfactory accommodation could be obtainedelsewhere.In discussion there was general approval of the arrangementproposed in the minute by the Earl Marshal annexed toW.P. (45) 265.  With regard to the question of accommodation for
travel facilities.&quot;Visits byMembers ofParliamentto Belgium.(previous reference:W.M.(45)2ndConclusions,Minute 8.)5. At their meeting on the 8th January, 1945, the WarCabinet had approved a scheme for travel to France by Members ofParliament.The Committee now had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (W.P. (45) 271) proposing that the scheme shouldbe extended to cover traA^el by Members of Parliament to Belgium.The Home Secretary explained that under the existing arrange-ments up to six Members of each House weekly, selected by ballot,were entitled to travel to France. It was not proposed to increasethe number eligible to travel under the ballot scheme but merely to extend its scope so that those successful in the ballot would havethe choice of going either to France or to Belgium or to both. Ifthe proposal was approved, the necessary arrangements would bemade with the appropriate officers of the House of Commons and house of Lords for the extension of the scheme, and an announce-ment would be made simultaneously in both Houses. The announce-ment might include a warning that hotel accommodation was vir-tually unobtainable in Belgium and that the Embassy in Brusselswas unable to assist Members to obtain accommodation.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals made in W.P. (45) 271 for theprovision of facilities for travel by Members of Parliamentto Belgium.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,30th April, 1945.the Members&apos; Post Office, it was suggested that the Minister ofWorks and the Postmaster-General should consider further thepossibility of obtaining accommodation elsewhere than inSt. Stephen&apos;s Hall. If no satisfactory alternative could be found,arrangements could in the last resort be made to remove thetemporary accommodation in St. Stephen&apos;s Hall a short time beforethe Hall was required for the use of the House of Commons andto restore the accommodation immediately after the State Opening.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved. the arrangements for the State Opening ofParliament set out in the. minute by the Earl Marshalannexed to W.P. (45) 265, and authorised the earl marshal to arrange for them to be communicated to theappropriate authorities in both Houses of Parliament ;-(2) Invited the Minister of Works and the Postmaster-general to give further consideration to the problem of findingalternative accommodation for the Members&apos; Post Office.
