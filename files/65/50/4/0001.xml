Bomber  Command had flown  3,100  sorties and  dropped(Previous       9,000 tons of bombs. Their targets had included the German HeadyReference:      quarters and barracks at Nordhausen, oil centres and U-boat yards/;W.M.-(4i5)89*&amp;&apos;*&quot; Itfosquitoes. had aitacked-&quot;Berlin on three nights. .-&apos;--./Conclusions, United States bombers had flown 6,800 sorties and droppedMinute 2.)      14,400 tons of bombs.   Their targets had included Kiel (on whichAir Operations, they had inflicted considerable damage), oil plants and airfields.The Tactical Air Force had flown 22,000 sorties. Heavy attacks had been made on enemy tanks and transport.Total   Allied   losses for the week had been 84 bombers,110 fighters and 10 Coastal Uommand aircraft.&apos;French paratroops had been dropped in connection with an operation in East Holland.   The Prime Minister pointed out thatthere might be political implications in the use of French troops in&apos;&apos; this sector, far to the north of the proposed French Zone of Occu-pation; and an opportunity should have been given for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to consider this aspect of the matter.   Hesaid that he would take this point up with General Eisenhower.Rockets and During the period under review no long-range rockets orFlying Bombs, flying bombs had been launched against this country or against(Previous Allied Forces in Europe. Since the start of the attack, 1,115 long-Reference: range rockets had been launched against this country. Of these 517W.M.(45)39th had fallen in the Greater London area. The total number of flyingConclusions, bombs launched against this country was 9,250, of which 5,900 had minute 3.)      crossed the coast and 4,220 had fallen in the Greater London area.2,005 flying bombs had been destroyed by gunfire, 1,978 by air-craft and 278 by balloons, making a total of 4,261 flying bombsdestroyed.The War Cabinet (1) Agreed that a statement should be prepared, for publicantion at some future date, giving full details of &quot;the attacks on this country by rockets and flying bombs.. This statement, while giving due credit to the achieve-ments of our air defences, should make it clear that relief&quot; from the continuance of these attacks had been secured bythe advance of our Armies along the coasts of France,Belgium and Holland.Mediterranean. In the Mediterranean 13,700 sorties had been flown and,000 tons of bombs dropped. The targets had included railway communications in Northern Italy, Austria, Southern Germany and yugoslavia.Pacific &quot; United States aircraft had attacked airfields and other targets in Formosa. Super-Fortresses had dropped 1,850 tons of bombs on four towns in Japan, including Tokyo^The War Cabinet- .(2) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to enquire of the United StatesChiefs of Staff whether it would be possible to arrange that future reports on operations in the Pacific should give information of the activities of the Royal Air Forceand Dominions Air Forces separately from those of theUnited States Air Force. &apos;Confirmed shipping losses for the week due to enemy action hadbeen 12,840 tons.During the week one U-boat had been sunk and; two probably sunk.   The scale of Urboat activity in our inshore waters wasdecreasing, but it was probable that several U-boats were deployedon anti-convoy operations in ocean, areas.......There had been E-boat activity in the North Sea on the nights ofthe ,6th-7th and 7th-8th April- On both nights successful inter-exceptions had been made by our light forces and 3 E-boats had been sunk and 5 damaged.[29880-3] - . b 2NavalOperations.
Pacific. Operations in the Loochoo Islands had continued during theweek, the British Pacific Fleet taking its part in the southern halfof the area and successfully neutralising enemy airfields in theSakishima Group. The landings on Okinawa continued to go well,but the opposition had stiffened. Since the 17th March the americans claimed that about 1,600 Japanese aircraft had been:^destroyed in this area.No details had yet become available from naval sources of the attack by American aircraft on Japanese naval units on the- 7th April, in which it was claimed, that the Japanese battleshipYamato. two cruisers and three destroyers had been sunk. Therewas no reason to doubt the accuracy of this report.Military Onthe western front 17 German Divisions were encircled in theOperations. Ruhr pocket, which was being gradually compressed. good progress had been made northwards towards Emden, and in northHolland our troops, after heavy fighting, had practically reachedthe Zuider Zee. Allied forces were pushing towards Hanover and bremen. German resistance between Hanover and Erfurt was weakbut was stronger at the north and south of the line. -Russia. Progress had been made in the vicinity of Vienna, which was now encircled.   The situation at Konigsberg was a little obscure,but the Russians were thought to be fighting in the town itself.The War Cabinet- - -      .(3) Took note of the statements by the Chiefs of Staff.Presentation of       2.   In connection with Conclusion (1) of the preceding Minute,the War Effort The Prime Minister of New Zealand suggested that it was desir-of the United able that a full-length film should be made depicting the war effortKingdom.       of the United Kingdom from 1939 up to the present day. A numberof good films had been made of particular aspects of war-timeBritain, including some made by the United States Army.   these had  aroused great enthusiasm in the Dominions and foreigncountries.   It would, however, be valuable for the recording of britain&apos;s part in the war if a full-length film could be produced at an early date which would present as a whole the story of britain&apos;s ordeal and achievement during the past five years.The Minister of Information said that a film on these lineswas already in preparation. He undertook to submit a report onthe matter to the War Cabinet.Poland.(previous reference.:W.M.(45)36thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that no reply had yet been received to the representations made to the SovietGovernment about the arrangements for the reconstitution of thePolish Government. Meanwhile, newspaper reports suggested thatthe Russians might be seeking to arrange unilaterally to associatecertain more representative Poles with the Lublin Government,without recourse to the procedure agreed at the Crimea Conference.It would be difficult to delay much longer making a further statement in the House of Commons. When the House reassembleda number of Parliamentary Questions were to be asked about thePolish situation. The best course might be to promise a full state-ment during the following week. This could be made on the dayfollowing the Debate on the Sari Francisco Conference.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the matter might be handled in the House ofCommons on the lines suggested by the Foreign Secretary.
249W.M. 41 (45).World 4.   The War Cabinet were informed that in the forthcomingOrganisation.    Debate in the House of Commons on the San -Francisco, ConferenceSan Francisco, one of the main topics of discussion would be the proposed votingConference.      formula in the Security Council.  This had been the subject of dis-(Previous       cussion earlier that day at theCommonwealth Meeting.  There had reference:      been general agreement that the Commonwealth representatives atW.M.(45)38th the Conference must accept the position arising from the YaltaConclusions,     Agreement under which the Great Powers had&apos;a right of veto.Minute 2.)      There was, however, room for argument at San Francisco about theextent of the veto.   The Dumbarton Oaks proposals required theconsent of all permanent Members of the Security Council to any amendment of the Charter of the World Organisation.  The YaltaAgreement had been concerned only with voting in the security council; and there were strong grounds for. claiming that the rightof veto should be limited to enforcement action for the maintenanceof security.  It was also arguable that the right of veto of a great power should not be exercisable in security issues arising from con-flicts between two smaller States. Thus, the veto might be restricted to issues in which a Great Power avowed itself to be concerned.The War Cabinet-Took note that this point would be considered further atsubsequent sessions of the Commonwealth Meeting.Occupied 5.   The Prime Minister of South A frica said that he wasHolland. profoundly concerned about the plight of the civil population in food Supplies, those parts of Holland which were still in German occupation.(Previous Between two and three million people in this area were facingReference: starvation; large numbers were dying already, and the situationW.M.(45)32nd was likely to deteriorate rapidly. He accepted the expert adviceConclusions, against special military operations for the relief of this area; butMinute 3.)      were there not other means of bringing assistance to these people?Unless some action were taken immediately, he felt that we mightsoon be in the presence of a great tragedy which would shock theconscience of the world.Would it not be possible to invite the German Government,through the Swiss Government as the Protecting Power, to give usfacilities to send in food supplies for distribution to the civilpopulation through the agency of the International Red Cross ?If the German Government declined this request, they would brandthemselves as criminals before the world and we could make apublic declaration that ^we should hold them responsible for theconsequences.Points in discussion were :-(a) Transport over the Rhine was the factor limiting the move-ment of supplies into Holland from areas under Allied military control. AH the bridges and other means of crossing the Rhine were needed for supplying the movement of our Forces to the east. Anytransport of supplies for the civil population in occupied Hollandwould be at the expense of these military movements.The Minister of War Transport said that, if the GermanGovernment accepted the proposal now suggested, it might bepossible to arrange for further supplies to be sent in to Holland- by sea. /&apos;--&apos;-.&quot;&quot;.; - .       - .   -&apos; - - (6) We had already arranged for limited supplies of food and- -  medical requirements to be sent to occupied Holland through/     Sweden.  It might be possible to arrange for increased supplies tobe sent by this route, in addition to any new channel of supply fromareas under Allied military control.(a) It was important that no time: should be lost. If thereforecommunications were made to the German: Government in the sensesuggested, it would be advisable to invite the Swiss Government atthe same time to arrange for the International Red Cross to begintheir preliminary preparations at once, in anticipation of a favour-able reply from the German Government.
The Prime-Minister suggested, &quot;that he should telegraph to president Roosevelt suggesting that the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and the United States should make a joint communication to the German Government, through the Protecting Power, to thefollowing effect. It was the responsibility of the German Govern-ment to sustain &quot;the civil population in those parts of Holland which remained in German occupation. As they had failed to dischargethat responsibility, the Allied Governments were prepared to sendfood and medical supplies for distribution to the civil population inthis area through the agency of the International Red Cross, bothby increasing the limited supplies which were already being sentthrough Sweden and by sending further supplies direct from areasunder Allied military control. The German Government were invited to accord the necessary facilities. The Swiss Governmentshould be asked, at the same time, to arrange for the internation red Cross to make all preliminary preparations so that they wouldbe ready to act at once if the German Government acceded to therequest. If, however, this request were refused, we should take steps to make it clear to the German Commander in Holland andall the troops under his command that by resisting our attempt tobring relief to the civil population in this area they would brandthemselves as criminals before the world, and would be held responsible with their lives for the consequences.The War Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the proposal made by the Prime Minister in his summing up, and took note that the-Prime minister would telegraph in this sense to President Roosevelt.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to prepare the necessarycommunications to the Swiss Government, in readiness for despatch as soon as President Roosevelt had indicated his concurrence in the course proposed.(3) Asked the Secretary of State for War to undertake thenecessary preparations to ensure that - the supplies required would be readily available.Arrangements 6.   The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the home for Celebrating Secretary (W.P. (45) 206) on the arrangements for celebrating thethe End of     end of hostilities with Germany.Europe ^he Home Secretary explained that the report annexed to his memorandum had been prepared by officials in the light of theviews expressed on certain points of policy by the Lord presidents committee (L.P. (45) 17th Meeting, Minute 2). He suggested that,subject to the views of the War Cabinet on the arrangements forbroadcasts by The King and the Prime Minister, the recommenda-tions in the report might now be approved, the appropriated departments might be instructed to complete the detailed arrange-ments and a statement might be made in the House of Commons onthe lines of the draft contained in the Appendix to the report.On the question of broadcasts, the Prime Minister said he feltthat on VE-day he should confine himself to announcing, as executivehead of the Government, that organised resistance by Germany had ceased. This announcement would be followed, either immediatelyor (as he thought preferable) on the evening of VE-day, by a broad-cast by The King to the nation and the Empire. A day or two laterhe himself might broadcast an address^ if this was desired.In discussion, there was general agreement as to the importanceof the timing both of the celebrations and of any advance announce-ment of the Government&apos;s proposals. The appropriate date for adeclaration that organised resistance was ended would have to bedetermined by the War Cabinet in agreement with our principalAllies. It would be most important to avoid making such adeclaration prematurely.
As regards the suggestion that a statement should now be madeof the Governments proposals, it was pointed out that, although some guidance by the Government would be desirable, a public announcement at the present time might have an unfortunate effecton the Forces engaged in operations. Before any pubic statement was made there should be consultation with the Commanders in thefield, both as to the timing of the statement and as to the proposalsthemselves. Meanwhile, the Minister of Information should take steps to discourage the discussion in the Press of arrangements forcelebrating the end of hostilities.Pending a public announcement, any confidential communica-tions on this subject to local authorities and other bodies concernedin the preparations should be made in such a way as to preventpublic discussion of their contents.Additional points in discussion were: (a) Stress was laid on the importance of avoiding any sugges-tion that there could be slackening in the effort against Japan.This was of particular importance from the point of view of the armed Forces and of public opinion in the Dominions.The Prime Minister said that he would bear this point in mind and, if necessary, mention it in his broadcast address to thecountry.(b) It was suggested that before public notice was given thathostilities were at an end, a few hours&apos; warning should be given(e:g., by asking the public to stand by at a given time for animportant announcement from the Prime Minister). This wouldenable factory managements to make advance, arrangements forstopping production and so to avoid the waste and danger whichwould be involved in a sudden stoppage without notice.(c) The Prime Minister said that he hoped the day of thecelebrations would be known as VE-day. The question whetherVE-day ought for any purposes to be regarded as the legal dateof the end of the war should be considered by the Law Officers,and the position should be made clear in any announcement.(d) With regard to paragraph (9) of W.P. (45) 206, the HomeSecretary explained that if VE-day fell on a Thursday or. anyearlier day of the week, it would be possible to hold the proposedservices of Prayer and Thanksgiving on the following Sunday.He would consult with the Service Ministers about the arrange-ments for lining the route to St. pauls. The Secretary of State forWar suggested that members of the Home Guard might be invitedto volunteer to take part in these parades.(e) The possibility of the Royal Navy&apos;s arranging a displayin the Thames on VE-day might be considered.The War Cabinet-(l) Approved the suggestion that broadcast messages should begiven by the Prime Minister, the President of the UnitedStates and Marshal Stalin on the occasion of the link-upof Anglo-American and Soviet Forces.(2) Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers proposals with regard to broadcasts on VE-day.(3) Approved in principle the proposals set out in para-graphs (2) to (10) of W.P. (45) 206 and invited theHome Secretary, after consultation with the commanders in the field, to arrange for the detailed plans to be worked out, with the Departments concerned,and thereafter to submit a further report to the WarCabinet.-(4) Agreed that for the present no public announcement ofthe Governments proposals should be made.
, Procedure in 7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by-Trials for High the Home Secretary arid the Secretary of State for ScotlandTreason. (W.P. (45) 204) seeking authority for the introduction of a Bill toprovide that all forms of treason should be indicted, arraigned, triedand attainted according to the same course and order of trial and upon the like evidence as indictments for murder.The War Cabinet were informed that in all cases of treason,other than those in which the overt act or acts were against theKing&apos;s life or person, a special procedure was prescribed whichcalled for a high degree of elaboration in the indictment and led to much technical argument as to the admissibility of evidence.Further complications arose in cases of treason committed abroad.The procedure and rules of evidence now in use in criminal trials inthis country were admittedly the fairest in the world and therewas ho longer any justification for retaining the special procedure for treason trials which had been laid down as a safeguard against certain abuses in the 17th century. This procedure might wellhinder the speedy and effective prosecution for treason of Britishsubjects who came into the hands of the authorities as -the occupationof Germany proceeded and for this reason an early amendment ofthe law was desirable. The Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General were in agreement with the proposal.The War Cabinet-&apos; Agreed that legislation should be prepared to amend thelaw relating to procedure in trials for high treason on thelines proposed in W.P. (45) 204.   The draft legislation&apos; should be submitted  for detailed examination by theLegislation Committee, and the Bill should be introduced- in the House of Lords.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,9th April, 1945.
