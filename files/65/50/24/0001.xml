In addition, the Royal Air Force had laid 47,311mines. In these operations the Royal Air Force Bomber CommandAir Operations, had lost 45,000 men and 10,801 aircraft: the United States bomber command had lost about the same number of men and 8,274 aircraft.During the last two weeks Bomber Command had dropped6,673 tons of food in Holland, and hadv brought back to this country45,000 released prisoners of war. United States bombers had carried 3,700 tons of supplies to Holland and had brought back8,700 prisoners of war. Air transport units under S.H.A.E.F.Command had carried 13,000 tons of supplies and brought back&quot;31,000 casualties and 10,000 prisoners of war.Up to date a total of 96,000 released prisoners of war and343,000 casualties had been brought to this country by air.4,000 troops and 300 vehicles had been flown to Norway.Two aircraft had been lost in the operation, one containing Air Vice-Marshal Streatfield, the Commander in charge of the operation.Troops arid equipment had also been flown to Denmark.In the period before the surrender of the German forces,Coastal Command had sighted 64 U-boats. 23 had been attacked arid 8 were claimed to have been sunk. Since the surrender, Coastal Command had sighted 30 U-boats flying the surrender flag and 6 others, 3 of which had been attacked.There had been a Royal Air Force detachment of about 2,000at Zara maintaining the Fighter Force co-operating with the partisans. Orders had been given to accelerate the withdrawal ofthis detachment.During the last two weeks 21,200 sorties had been flown inSouth-East Asia for the loss of 11 aircraft. 7 enemy aircraft hadbeen destroyed.In the Pacific, shore-based aircraft had flown over 10,000 sortiesfor the loss of 2 aircraft. Enemy losses had been 22. Operationsr had been mainly against the naval dockyard and oil storage plant at Saigon, airfields in Formosa and gun positions and airfields inBorneo. 3,600 tons of bombs had been dropped on targets in japan and 1,400 mines laid by night off Tokyo. 18 aircraft had been lost.Naval Two ships totalling 4,669 tons had been lost by enemy actionOperations.      on the 7th May.  Total losses in May had been 19,204 tons.- -&apos;-&apos;T 12 U-boats had probably been sunk in May up to the time-     of the surrender.   33 U-boats at sea had so far indicated their positions.;   Of these,  19 had now arrived in our harbours.^ *        91 U-boats had been reported in Norwegian ports and 75 in Danish,French and North German ports.Naval Port Parties had been established in the main ports in north-west Germany, Denmark, and Norway.   A channel had been;  ii,        swept across the North Sea to Hamburg, which was now open to shipping.Pacific. Aircraft of the United States Fleet and the British PacificFleet had continued neutralising operations against the airfields in, the islands of the Nansei Shoto Group.   Our battleships andcruisers had also carried out bombardments against these airfields.In heavy counter-attacks by Japanese aircraft considerable losses had been inflicted on the attacking aircraft.Military The War Cabinet were given the latest information regardingOperations.      the position of the Russian and Anglo-American Armies in Europe.In Holland it now appeared that the damage by flooding was. J not likely to be so great as had been feared.  It was estimated thatif sufficient coal could be provided, de-flooding measures could be. completed (except at Walcheren) by the end of the year, and theland might be restored to its normal condition by 1947.   The food[29981-5] - - b 2Norway.Coastal .Command.Mediterranean.South-BastAsia.Pacific.   &apos;,
situation also was less acute than had been expected; and thedespatch of food supplies was proceeding satisfactorily.Of the estimated total of 180,000 British Commonwealthprisoners of war in Europe, it was estimated that some 163,000had been recovered and 97,471 brought to this country.Burma. -   In the Rangoon area our advance east of the Sittang River had met with stiffer opposition. On the Irrawaddy our forces had reached Minhla,: The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Third Session 2. At their meeting on the 12th March the War Cabinet had of the Council approved the proposal that the next meeting of the Council ofof U.N.R.R.A. U.N.R.R. A, should be held in London in June 1945.(Previous The Minister of State reported that, in accordance with the reference:      Council&apos;s rules of procedure, the invitations for this meeting shouldW.Mv(45)28th he issued on the 15th May; and Governor Lehman had sought theConclusions,    advice of the State Department in Washington on the representa-Minute 6.)      tion Gf Poland at this meeting.   He had asked whether he shouldRepresentation invite the Polish Government in London, or the Provisional Govern-of Poland.       ment in Lublin, or not issue any invitation to the Poles at all.  Theview of the State Department (as reported in Washington TelegramNo. 3286 of the 11th May) was that no invitation should be issued to Poland; and the State Department were prepared to adviseGovernor Lehman accordingly if they were assured of the supportof the United Kingdom Government.The Prime Minister said that, while it was clear that an invitation should not be issued to the Lublin Government&quot;, it was difficult to. decide between the two other possible courses without having the advice of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsbased on his latest discussions in the United States on the polish question as a whole. He therefore suggested that a decision on thispoint should be deferred for two weeks, even though this meantpostponing by a corresponding period the meeting of the U.NR.R.A.Council. - -The War Cabinet Endorsed the Prime Ministers suggestion, and invited theMinister of State to arrange for the State Department in washington to be informed that the United KingdomGovernment desired to defer for two weeks tendering anyadvice on the question of the representation of Poland atthe Third Session of the U,N.R.R.A. Council.International 3.   At their meeting on the 12th April the War Cabinet had.Aspects of      approved the line to be taken by the representatives of His Majesty&apos;sColonial Policy. Government at the San Francisco Conference on the question of(Previous       Colonial Trusteeship.   They now had before them a MemorandumReference:      by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (45) 300) reportingWM. (45)42nd the progress of the discussions on this question at San Francisco.Conclusions,    On the 4th. May the United Kingdom and the United States delega-Minute 7.)     tions had published drafts of a chapter on this subject for inclusion in the Charter ofthe World Organisation.   The United Kingdomdraft was based on the policy approved by the War Cabinet.  TheUnited States draft differed from this draft in certain important.     respects, particularly in providing for a special category of... &quot; strategic-areas;in respect of which all&apos;.functions of supervisionwould be exercised by the Security Council:   After discussion&quot;   between the United States and the United Kingdom delegations, aT  new draft had been produced as a working text, on which theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs asked for an immediateindication of the views of the War Cabinet.&apos;
The Secretary of State for the Golondes-mid- th&amp;t .a decision was necessary for the guidance of the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, first on the question whether we should continueto oppose on political grounds a division of trusteeship territoriesinto the two categories-strategic areas and other areas- proposedby the United States. This feature of the United States proposals had been accepted by Russia, France and China, and we could probably look for little support in contesting ife It was, however,open to certain military objections; and, as it would enable theUnited States to secure the territories in which they Were interestedfree from any obligations of &quot; trusteeship,&quot;. it would remove the incentive they would otherwise have to take a realistic&apos;view of the&quot; trusteeship &quot; system. Apart from this general point, there werefour other major matters for decision which were discussed inparagraph 5 of W.P. (45) 300. ^ : ;   . &apos;The Colonial Secretary said that he was especially concernedwith the position of the existing mandated territories. He fely strongly that1 we should not admit that our position in those areaswas open to any question or could be varied without our full consent;and that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should be instructed that, if our essential objectives were not accepted in thepresent discussions at San Francisco, His Majesty&apos;s Government,though willing to adapt themselves to the new machinery that would replace that of the League of Nations, could hot agree to any modifications in their present mandated territories.The Prim\e Minister said that in his view the proper course was to refuse to accept any compromise in respect of our presentmandated territories; but, subject to that, to allow the UnitedStates to have their way over the special category of &quot; strategic &quot;areas in which they would wish to place all the Pacific islands whichthey might capture from the Japanese. He thought it would bebetter tactics to, postpone pressing even for improvements whichwe were justifiably anxious to see in the conditions of the presentmandates. *The Minister of Aircraft Production suggested that theposition could be largely protected by substituting, for paragraph 5of the &quot; new working text&quot; set out in column C of Annex I toW.P. (45) 300, an amended text on the following lines;: &quot; except as may be agreed upon in individual trusteeship arrangementsplacing each territory under the trusteeship system, nothing in this chapter should be construed in such a manner as to involve any alteration of the existing mandate which would continue in thesame, terms as guaranteed under the League of Nations unless anduntil altered in agreement with the mandatory Power.&quot;The Chief of the Imperial General Staff agreed that, if thestatus of our existing mandated territories remained unchangedunder the new arrangements, the position would be satisfactoryfrom the point of view of the Chiefs of Staff.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Colonial. Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Aircraft Production arid the Paymaster-General to draft a telegram to the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs in the light of the discussion and. to submit it to the Prime Minister for approval beforedespatch. :(2) Agreed that the Colonial Secretary, with the Minister of aircraft Production and the Paymaster-General, should examine on behalf of the War Cabinet further requestsfrom the United Kingdom-delegation at San Franciscofor guidance on Colonial Trusteeship; and should settle the instructions to be given, subject as might benecessary to the approval of the Prime Minister andon the understanding that any matter involving any. substantial fresh concession would]-. be referred to theWar Cabinet. .
FoodV 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a report by the MinisterWorld Supply of Production and the Minister of Food (W.P. (45) 291) on theirSituation.       Mission in the United States on world food supplies.(Previous The Minister of Production briefly reviewed the work of the reference: Mission. While the results were less extensive than he could haveW.M.(45)3lst hoped, both he and the Minister of Food were convinced that theyConclusions, represented the maximum that could have been secured in presentMinute 2.) circumstances. It was satisfactory to have established the principleReport of of equal per capita consumption in the three countries in respectMission to of oils and fats and sugar. It had been impossible to reach a moreUnited States, satisfactory agreement in respect of meat owing to the incompletearrangements for meat rationing in the United States.He invited the War Cabinet to confirm the agreements that hadbeen made and to authorise the Minister of Food, and himself to take action on the lines recommended in their joint report.The Minister of Food said that he was anxious, if the WarCabinet approved, to announce at once the effect of these agreements on rations in this country, as set out in paragraph 7 of W.P. (45) 291.It was desirable that the public should realise at once what our intentions were, and we should not overlook the possible propagandavalue in the United States of the fact that we were about to makecuts in our civilian consumption. :The Minister drew particular attention to the danger that countries outside the Combined Food Board would use their foreignbalances to buy meat in the Argentine. The Argentine Government,with whom (for reasons with which the War Cabinet were familiar)we had had to postpone the conclusion of a meat contract last year,were now showing little willingness to conclude a long-term meat. . contract, and were likely to ask for a 16 per cent, increase in price.The President and the State Department had both promised to givesupport to our remaining the sole buyers of meat in the Argentine;but a French Mission was shortly proceeding to the Argentine, andhe suggested that the Foreign Office should exert pressure on theFrench Government to refrain from seeking separate meat contractsthere.After discussion, the War Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations of the Minister ofProduction and the Minister of Food, as set out in thereport appended to W.P. (45) 291, and invited theMinister of Food to confirm to the United StatesGovernment our acceptance of the Memorandum of understanding attached as Annex I to W.P. (45) 291.(2) Approved, subject to the decision on ration scales for prisoners of war (see Conclusion (5) below), an announce-ment by the. Minister of Food of the decisions proposedin paragraph 7 of W.P. (45) 291. . ; *:(3) Decided to defer until after the Foreign Secretary&apos;s return from the United States a decision as regards pressure on the French Government in the matter of Frenchpurchases of meat in the Argentine.Publication The War Cabinet next aiscussed the proposals p:ot forward by of Statistics,    the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in W.P. (45) 298 for thepublication of -statistics of the prospective deficiencies in food supplies during 1945.The War Cabinet-(4) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries toarrange for the publication of the statistics set out inthe Appendices to W.P. (45) 298.Ration Scales The Minister of Food pointed out that, according to hisfor prisoners information, the ration scales for prisoners of waf in Britishof war. custody represented 2,986 calories per day as against a figure of2,300 for non-working and 2,900 for working prisoners of war in
Fishing 5.   The Prime Minister said that, now that hostilities in industry. Europe were over, he looked for a substantial increase in the rateRelease of at which the Admiralty had planned to release fishing trawlersTrawlers by which were now being used by the Royal Navy. He also consideredthe Admiralty, that the Admiralty should arrange that special facilities should be afforded for the repair and reconversion of these trawlers, even atthe expense of new construction and repair of warships.In discussion, it was suggested that the larger trawlers shouldbe released first, as these gave a bigger return for the man-poweremployed. It was also suggested that special steps should be takento release from the Royal Navy fishermen to operate these trawlers.The Minister of War Transport said that some assistance inmanning might be obtained from the pool of merchant seamen.The War Cabinet Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to submit proposals for expediting the release of requisitioned fishingtrawlers, and for- providing for their repair andreconversion.the custody of the United States Forces. The corresponding average figure for the civilian population in this country was 2,807.The Secretary of State for War said that these figures differed from the last which he had received from S.H.A.E.F.; but he was aware that the United States scales had recently been subject tofrequent changes. He was anxious to keep in line with the UnitedStates in this matter and, if the Minister of Food was going to announce even a small reduction in civilian rations, it was important that we should first ensure that the scales for prisoners inBritish custody were at least as low as those for prisoners in UnitedStates custody. -The Prime Minister invited the Secretary of State for&apos; War toprovide him with a draft telegram to General Eisenhower, witha view to his discussing this matter with General Eisenhower attheir meeting later in the week. The publication of the decisions which had now been taken on the report of the Minister of Food andthe Minister of Production could be postponed for a few days, inorder that arrangements might first be made to assimilate theBritish and American ration scales for prisoners of war.The War Cabinet-(5) Endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion as summarised above.British The Prime Minister said that he thought it important that theRestaurants. British Restaurants, which had served a most useful purpose, shouldnot be allowed to disappear. An announcement on this subjectmight perhaps be made in the House of Commons. It was suggestedthat the retention of British Restaurants might be criticised on theground of competition with small restauranteurs who were now serving in the Forces and would wish to take up their previousoccupation on demobilisation.The War Cabinet-(6) Took note that the Minister of Food would submit to thePrime Minister a note on the future of BritishRestaurants.
Burma. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by(Previous the Secretary of State for Burma (W.P. (45) 290) covering the reference: proof of a White Paper embodying a statement of future policyW.M. (45) 58th in Burma. .   &apos;Conclusions, jn  discussion  the   following  drafting   amendments   were minute 50 proposed-      -(a) Page 8, section 31, line 5. Before &quot;recruited&quot; insert&quot;largely.&quot;(b) Page 11. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that hecould not agree to the suggestion in the last sentence of the white paper that the administration of the scheduled areas &quot;would remain for the time being a responsibility of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.&quot; There must be some sharing of responsibility andof finance with the Government Of BurmaHe suggested that thispassage should be amended so as to state that the scheduled areas&quot; would for the time being be subject to a special regime. ...&quot;(c) The Minister of State said that he had certain verbalamendments to suggest which he would communicate to theSecretary of State for Burma.The War Cabinet-Approved the draft White Paper annexed to W.P.(45) 290, subject to the amendments noted above, and authorised the Secretary of State for Burma to arrangefor its presentation to Parliament.Housing.ProductionAgreement,Bulk orders and erection of Houses bythe Ministryof Works.(previous reference:W.M.(45)49thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. At their meeting on the 23rd April the War cabinet had agreed that the Minister of Works should be authorised asproposed in W.P. (45) 266, to make agreements for the productionof house materials, component parts and complete houses, to buyand sell such items, and to erect houses on behalf of local. authorities.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (45) 294) reporting that,while the Law Officers were satisfied that no legislation wasnecessary to empower the Minister of Works to carry out these operations, legislation would be needed to enable the operations to be financed from the Consolidated Fund. It had been suggested at a meeting of the Legislation Committee on the 8th May(H.P.C. (45) 15th Meeting, Minute 4) that the necessary financemight be provided from the Vote of Credit, but the Chancellorcould not accept this view for the reasons given in paragraph 2 of w.P.&quot;(45) 294. In his view, the alternatives were to provide thefinance by a Supplementary Estimate or, as he preferred, to.introduce a short Bill authorising the necessary advances to bemade from the Consolidated Fund.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a Bill to authorise advances from the consolidated Fund for the purposes of the operationsproposed in W.P. (45) 266 should be drafted with aview to its being introduced and passed as a matter of urgency;(2) Agreed that in view of the urgency and Of the decisionto obtain legislation no objection need be raised to theMinister of Works proceeding at once with the opera-tions proposed, including the placing of urgentcontracts. .    &quot; . .Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,Uth May, 1945.
