Migration. 1    The War Cabinet considered Memoranda by the Secretary(Previous of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (45) 35 and W.P. (45) 233) on reference:       post-war migration policy.W.M. (44) 139th In the latter Memorandum two issues were submitted for conclusions,     decision by the War Cabinet: Minute 4.) ^ T1:ie Australian Government were prepared to accept thedraft agreements on migration which had been circulated in w.P. (45) 35, subject to the deletion of the provision which putex-Service men and women from this country on a level, as regardspreference in obtaining employment, with Australian ex-Servicemen and women. It was proposed in the Memorandum, with the strong support of our High Commissioner at Canberra, that weshould press the Australian Government to accord to ex-Sefvicemen and women from this country the same preference in employ-ment as would be given to Australian ex-Service men and women.(ii) Free passages would be granted for the approved emigra-tion of ex-Service men and women and their dependants. There. was, however, an outstanding difference of opinion between theDominions Office and the Treasury regarding the maximum rate which should be payable by other emigrants under the scheme forassisted passages. Before the war the maximum payable by theemigrant had been one-third of the minimum rate ( 33, subse-quently raised to  37), the remaining two-thirds being borne inequal shares by the two Governments. The post-war cost ofpassages to Australia was likely to be somewhere between  65and  75. The Dominions Office, with the support of the australian government, favoured a maximum contribution of  10 by theemigrant. The Treasury considered that the total cost should be divided equally between the emigrant and the two Governments,with the result that the emigrant would be required to pay  20to  25.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that australia was the only Dominion with which it had proved possibletb make any progress in the discussion of post-war migration policy.He was therefore the more anxious to conclude this agreement withthe Australian Government. He thought it essential to press thatex-Service emigrants from this country should receive the sameemployment preference as Australian ex-SerVice men and women.But he hoped to be able to meet the views of the Australian Govern-ment on the contribution to be made by other emigrants to the costof assisted passages.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet ;(1) Endorsed the proposal that the Australian Governmentshould be pressed to extend to ex-Service men andwomen from this country the same treatment as regardspreference for employment as would be accorded to* Australian ex-Service men and women.Discussion then turned on the scale of the contribution to bemade by other approved emigrants to the cost of assisted passagesto Australia.The following points were made: (a) How far was it desirable to encourage emigration? Thiscountry, with a diminishing population, could not afford to sendits best stock abroad after the war. It was pointed out, on the otherhand, that in the years immediately before the war immigration from the Dominions to the United Kingdom more than outbalancedemigration from the United Kingdom to the Dominions.(&amp;) Though the numbers of emigrants after the war were not likely to be large, emigration&apos;from this country to the Dominionswas a valuable means of strengthening the cohesion of the BritishCommonwealth. It was suggested that it might be desirable to concentrate on assisting the emigration of women, in view of thesurplus of women in this country.
2. At their meeting on the 12th April the War Cabinet had agreed that no special facilities should be accorded &quot;to Mr. HarryPollitt to enable him to travel to Finland to attend the Conferenceof the Communist Party of Finland,The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthis Conference was due to open on the 17th April. If Mr. Pollittwere formally refused an exit permit, representations were likelyto be made in Parliament, and the Government would be criticised for having refused to a member of one political party, facilities which they would not have withheld from members of other parties.For this reason he would prefer to grant Mr. Pollitt an exit permitand to rely on the fact that travel facilities would not in practice be available to enable him to reach Finland in time for theConference.In discussion it was disclosed that the Foreign Office had informed Mr. Pollitt on the 7th April that, although they couldnot promise him any special priority, they Would do their best tosecure him an air passage to Finland. On the other hand, the WarCabinet were informed that there was little practical possibilityof finding.for him at this stage a passage which would get him to finland in time for the Conference....In these circumstances it was suggested that the best coursewould be to inform Mr. Pollitt that it was impossible to secure for him an air passage which would enable him to reach Finland intime for the Conference, and that for this reason he would deriveno advantage from the grant of the exit permit for which he had applied.The War Cabinet- -Agreed that the matter should be dealt with on these lines.Mr, HarryPollitt;proposed visit to finland. -(previous reference:W.M.(45)42ndConclusions,Minute 8.)[29935-2](c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he didnot wish to argue against&quot; assisted emigration, he found greatdifficulty in: accepting proposals about passage-money which mightimply that  10 to-day was equivalent to the pre-war figure of  11,While he would not press for an equal division of the cost of ahassisted passage, he felt strongly that there should be some, reason-able increase in the contribution which the emigrant had; to make to the increased cost of the passage; He would be prepared to compromise on the basis of a payment of  15 by the emigrant^ thebalance to be divided between the Australian and the. UnitedKingdom Governments.(d) It was suggested that, if such ah arrangement were accepted, every effort should be made to reduce the cost of thesepassages. If this could be reduced to about  45, the effect wouldbe that, as before the war, the total cost would be divided equally between the emigrant and the two Governments.After further discussion the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs said that he would be prepared to accept the Chancellorssuggestion.The War Cabinet-(2) Agreed that the contribution to be made towards assistedpassages to Australia by emigrants other than ex-Servicemen and women should be fixed at  15.
Death ofPresidentRoosevelt.memorial service.(previous reference:W.M.(45)45thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. At their meeting earlier in the day the War Cabinet had invited the Home Secretary to consider what arrangements mightbe made to enable the nation as a whole to join in paying a tribute to President Roosevelt at the time of the Memorial Service on the17th April.The Home Secretary said that he had examined the suggestions made at the earlier meeting; and was satisfied that the only practicable course would be to encourage the tolling of church bellsthroughout the country. He therefore proposed, if the War cabinet agreed, to issue a public notice through the press and B.B.C.announcing that a muffled peal of bells would be tolled at St. Paul&apos; cathedral at the end of the Memorial Service (about 12.15 p.m.) and suggesting that those responsible should arrange, wherever practicable, that church bells should be tolled at this time through-out the country.It was suggested that, in addition, works managements shouldbe invited to arrange for the broadcast of the muffled peal at St.Paul&apos;s to be heard in factories throughout the country. It was generally agreed that the relaying of this part of the broadcast,for a period of not more than two minutes; would afford a suitable opportunity for workers in the factories to pay tribute to thememory of President Roosevelt; but there was some doubt whetherarrangements could be made at such short notice to have this doneeffectively.The War Cabinet^-(1) Authorised the Home Secretary to issue a notice throughthe press and B.B.C., in the terms proposed, about thetolling of church bells throughout the country;(2) Invited the Minister of Information to arrange for guidance to be given to works managements about therelaying of the broadcast of the bells of St. Paul&apos;s unlesson enquiry he was satisfied that it was already too late to make effective arrangements for this purpose.Germany.organisation for military government.4. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (45) 239) on the organisation formilitary government in Germany.The Secretary of State for War said that planning for thecontrol of Germany had proceeded hitherto on the general assump-tion that there would be a formal surrender by an effectiveGovernment of Germany, and that a central German administration would remain in being, which would be controlled by an inter-allied control Commission sitting in Berlin. It now looked as though there would be no formal surrender, no central administration, andno opportunity for an effective inter-Allied Control Commission forsome time. Moreover, conditions in Germany during..the initial period would make it difficult to maintain effective control from thecentre. -In these circumstances, the British Commander-in-Chief mightbe compelled for some time to control his own Zone as best he could;and that Zone was likely, as things had turned out, to be the most difficult to administer. . It was therefore important that theCommander-in-Chief of the British Zone should be designated atonce so that a suitable officer acceptable to him could be appointed as his Deputy and begin to plan for the work ahead of him.The British Commander-in-Chief must also be enabled, so faras possible, to control and administer the British Zone for such period as might be necessary, notwithstanding that only theminimum of guidance might be obtainable from the inter-allied control Commission. It was therefore desirable that he should begiven the necessary directives, particularly in regard to the employ-ment of German labour on agricultural and industrial work.
In discussion the following points were made : (a) The division of the zones of occupation between the threeAllies had originated from discussions at the Quebec Conference^For military reasons, the Chiefs of Staff had thought it essentialthat British forces should occupy the North-Western Zone. Thiswas an area deficient&apos; in food supplies, with substantial industrial undertakings and a potentially serious unemployment problem.The areas of surplus food supply were in the Russian Zone or, likeEast Prussia, likely to be transferred to Poland m any settlement;and it was not clear that we could count on Russia to make availablesurplus food supplies from Eastern Europe.(&amp;) The military administration in the British Zone should be supplemented by civilians with expert knowledge of industrial conditions, who would work under the direction of the military administration. &quot; The Secretary of State for War explained that asubstantial civil staff had already been earmarked for this purpose.(c) While ideally the distribution of the food resources avail-able for Germany should be settled in respect of Germany as a wholeby the Allied Control Commission sitting in Berlin, and surplusesin one area used to compensate shortages in another, the destructionof communications, the breakdown of the administrative system,and the fact that the Control Commission could only operate subjectto agreement on each point by its four members, suggested that thiswould be difficult of achievement in the early stages.The Prime Minister said that a sharp distinction should bedrawn between what might be described as the British political zone of occupation, and the zone actually in the occupation of our military. forces on VE-day. It should clearly be understood, in his view, thatany move from the area actually occupied by our troops on VE-day to the British political zone of occupation must be subject tothe conclusion of a satisfactory agreement between the occupying powers for the due sharing between the various political Zones ofthe total food supplies available for the people of Germany.The War Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the view expressed -by the Prime Minister, as -summarised above.(2) Approved the proposals in paragraph 6 of W.P. (45) 239on the understanding that (i) they would be regarded as applying in the first instance, not to the political zone of Occupation proposed for the British Forces, but tothe territory actually occupied by British Forces onVE-day; and (ii) that our assumption of responsibilityfor the occupation of the remainder of our politicalZone was dependent on a satisfactory agreement on the equitable sharing of food supplies between the variousZones.As regards paragraph 5 of W.P. (45) 239, the Secretary ofState for War said that he understood that the Prime Ministerfavoured the designation of Field-Marshal Montgomery as commander-in-Chief of the British Zone. It would be of substan-tial assistance if an early announcement of this proposed appeint-ment could be made, so that the War Office could proceed withthe appointment of a suitable Deputy and could discuss future arrangements with Field-Marshal Montgomery.The Prime Minister indicated that he favoured an early announcement.        -The War Cabinet-(3) Agreed that the appointment of Field-Marshal Montgomeryas Commander-in-Chief of the British Zone should be announced at an early date; and took note that theSecretary of State for War would submit for theapproval of the Prime Minister the draft of a public announcement.
Empire 5.   At their meeting on the 22nd November, 1944, the WarTelecom- , Cabinet had agreed that a Mission should be appointed to visit themunications. Dominions and India to explain the reasons why His Majesty&apos;s(Previous Government in, the United Kingdom were unableto accept the reference.: scheme of the Commonwealth Communications Council for the:WM. (44) 154th organisation of telecommunications services throughout theConclusions, Commonwealth, and to explore the various alternative schemes,.Minute 3.) including the suggestion for the establishment of a. public utilityorganisation to take over the functions of Cable and Wireless, Ltd.The War Cabinet now had before them, a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer, as Chairman of the ministerial committee on Empire -Telecommunications (W.P. (45) 246),.reporting the results of the Mission to the Dominions, India and southern Rhodesia which had been undertaken by Lord Reith inpursuance of the War Cabinefs earlier conclusion. Lord Reith had found, in the Dominions general support for the view&apos;that an organisation on public utility lines would offer the best hope ^ ofproviding the efficient system of Empire telecommunications which,post-war conditions and the competition of foreign interests would demand. The Australian Government had put forward proposals-.(summarised in Annex-4 to Lord Reith&apos;s Report) which wouldsubstitute for the loose linkage of the Commonwealth Communica-tions Council an incorporated central body with precise and authoritative powers over policy and finance. These proposals weresupported by the Governments of New Zealand, SouthernRhodesia and India; South Africa and Canada, while accepting the objectives and machinery proposed by the Australian Govern-ment, were unwilling to subscribe to them except tin a voluntary and consultative basis. All the Dominion Governments were,however, anxious that an Empire Telecommunications conference should be held in London with a view to working out a solution on public utility lines in the light of the results of Lord Reith&apos;mission. All the members of the Ministerial Committee, with theexception of the Lord Privy Seal, endorsed the proposals made in lord Reith&apos;s Report.The Lord Privy Seal, in elaborating his minority Reportreproduced in Annex &quot; A &quot; of W.P. (45) 246, said that Cable and wireless, Ltd., was a strong and efficient company.    It hadspecialised in providing exceptionally favourable rates for the transmission of press messages by British newspapers; and, by this concession and by its general efficiency, had aroused the hostility of competing interests in the United States.  The financial position ofthe company was sound; it had a capital of  30 million and assets of  20 million.  Its future prospects were good. Technical develop-ihents during the war had substantially increased the speed of cabletransmission, and it was likely that in the future cable communi-cations would be able to compete effectively with communicationsby wireless.   There would be no sufficient case for the dissolution of the company, even if the Dominions were united in favour ofthis course.   In fact, however, the Dominions were not unanimous,as was shown in his minority Report. In his view the proper course was that, before further consideration was given to the Australianproposals, the Ministerial Committee should invite the directors of Cable and Wireless, Ltd., to furnish their comments on those proposals and to provide an estimate of the financial stability oftheir company in the future.The main points made in discussion were :-(a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was the viewof the Treasury that the future financial position of Cable and wireless, Ltd., was precarious, partly because of the competition,of air mails and wireless telephony; and partly because of the-. determination of the Dominions to secure greater local autonomyfor telecommunications services.
279 W.M. 46 (85).(6) The dominating feature in the situation was the strong desire of Dominion Governments to dispense&apos; with control by a profit-earning corporation centred in London. If the presentsystem could not be terminated by agreement, some of the dominions were likely to break away from the Commonwealth CommunicationsCouncil.(c) It was vitally important to retain facilities for rapid andcheap telecommunications throughout the British Commonwealth;and the proposals put forward in Lord Reith&apos;s Report offered thebest hope of attaining this objective.(d) Lord Reith had been much more successful than the ministerial Committee had expected in finding a common measureof agreement on this question among the Governments, of theDominions and India. It was important that the advance thusmade towards an agreed solution should be followed up withoutdelay by further discussion at a Commonwealth telecommunications-tions Conference in London.(e) The Secretary of State for Air said that the service departments had a vital interest in Empire telecommuncations and, if any such Conference were held,, they should be given anopportunity of making their views known.  This was agreed to.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that itappeared to be the general view of the War Cabinet that discussionof these issues should be taken a further stage on the basis of LordReith&apos;s Report. The changes contemplated in the Report could notbe made without legislation; and it was clear that legislation could not be undertaken within the life-time of the present Parlia-ment. There was, therefore, no reason why this Government shouldbe finally committed to the scheme put forward in Lord Reith&apos;sReport. The War Cabinet need not do more at this stage thanaccept this scheme as a basis for further discussion with DominionGovernments. It was also desirable that the directors of Cable and wireless, Ltd., should now be given an opportunity to furnish tothe Ministerial Committee their comments on the scheme putforward in Lord Reith&apos;s Report.The War Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the views expressed by the Prime Minister as summarised above.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange fora Commonwealth Telecommunications Conference to beheld in London, for the purpose of discussing theproposals made in Lord Reith&apos;s Report.(8) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange that,meanwhile, the directors of Cable and Wireless, Ltd.,should be invited to.furnish&apos; their comments on theproposals put forward in Lord Reith&apos;s Report and given  an opportunity, if they so desired, to discuss, theseproposals with members of the Ministerial Committeeon Empire Telecommunications.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,16th April, 1945.

far. Re36HO circulation.M. (us) U6TH CONCLUSIONS(16th April, 19h7 - 6*0 p.m.JUPIED HOLLANDief&apos;previous Reference:1.(45) 41stIllusions, Minute 5)The Prime Minister informed the WarCabinet of a conversation which he and field Marshal Smuts had had at Chequers duringthe week-end with Dr. Gerbrandy, the PrimeMinister of Holland.It appeared that conversations hadtaken place between the Reich Commissar for southern Holland, Dr. Seyss Inquart.,  and someof the leaders of the Underground Movement in holland.     The Reich Commissar was determined thathe would not surrender unconditionally so long as there was an effective Government or military authority in power in Germany.     If the british forces advanced beyond the Grebbe Line, theGermans would obey their orders to fight to thelast and would blow the decisive dams.     Thiswould enable the German Forces to prolong their,defence along causeways and in strong points;    butthe civil population of Holland would starve andthe country would be ruined for many years to come.If, on the other hand, Field Marshal Montgomeryundertook not to force the Grebbe Line, theGermans would agree not to flood the country;    toallow supplies to be brought in for the civilpopulation from any quarter under the agency ofthe international Red Cross;    and to surrenderunconditionally as soon as organised resistanceby Germany was at an end.     Dr. Gerbrandy strongly

favoured acceptance of this offervThe Prime Minister said that two alternative courses were open to us.     We could accept this offer and neutralise the area for aperiod,during which no fighting would take place and relief could be brought to the civil population,until the final breakdown of the civil and military-power in Germany.     We should thus forego theimmediate satisfaction of a surrender of theGerman troops in Holland, but should bringimmediate relief to the civil population andsafeguard the future prosperity of the country.Alternatively, we could make it clear toSeyss Inquart and the German troops in Hollandthat they were completely cut off, with no meansof escape;    and that, if they continued a hopelessresistance without regard to the lives of thepopulation or the future fertility of Holland,their whole number would be placed in first priority on the list of war criminals.The Prime Minister indicated that he himself favoured the first of these courses.It would, however, be necessary to consult theUnited States Government and to inform the SovietGovernment.     He had,  therefore,  sent a fullrecord of his conversation to the Foreign Secretary,foreign Office Telegram to Washington No. 3736 of16th April), asking him to take an early opportunityof consulting President Truman and suggesting that,subject&apos; to his views, the matter might be discussed by the three Foreign Secretaries while they were inthe United States, and their recommendationsreported to the Heads of the three Governments.-2- it &apos;     PI

A written record, provided by Dr. Gerbrandyji  ofthe conversation between Dr. Seyss Inquart andthe Dutch underground leaders was embodied inForeign Office Telegram to Washington No. 3737of 16th April.The views of the Chiefs, of Staff had also been communicated to the Foreign secretary in Foreign Office Telegram to Washington No. 3760of 16th April.The proposals outlined by the PrimeMinister would supersede the suggestion, discussed by the War Cabinet at their meeting on 9th April,for negotiations with the German Government for thesupply of relief to the civil population in occupiedHolland.     It would be preferable to deal with the reich Commissar direct rather than to approach theGerman Government as previously proposed.The War Cabinet -Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.
