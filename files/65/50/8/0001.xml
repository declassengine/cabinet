(45) 41st Conclusions,Minute 1, Conclusion (2)), about the activities of Dominion AirForces operating with United States Air Forces in the Pacifictheatre. He had, however, ascertained that during March 11,000sorties had been flown in this theatre by the Australian Air Force,and 189 by the New Zealand Air Force, against Japanese garrisons in New Guinea, New Britain and the Solomons.

Home waters and north atlantic.Mediterranean.East Indies.Pacific.MilitaryOperations.Italy.Burma.Russia.On the night of &quot;12th/13th April our Forces had driven offeight U-boats approaching the Nore-Flushing channel.,A French naval force was supporting the. military operations at the mouth of the Gironde.Eleven midget U-boats had been sunk and six probably sunkduring the week.Between 11th and 14th April coastal forces had had consider-able success against enemy convoys in the North Adriatic.As a result of a sweep by our destroyers off the Burma coast,five small enemy craft had been sunk. British naval forces,including battleships, had bombarded north-west Sumatra on the11th April.Recent submarine patrols had surik four coasters, three landing craft and three junks off Sumatra.Operations in the Ryuku Islands had continued during theweek. United States naval forces claimed to have shot down100 enemy aircraft and sunk 23 small craft between the 11th and13th April.The British Pacific Fleet had attacked airfields at Formosa onthe 12th and 13th April and 38 enemy aircraft had been shot down.Successful attacks had also been made on shore installations and buildings in Formosa.In North-East Holland, advances had been made in theApeldoorn-Arnbem area, and our forces had now reached the coast.German resistance South of Bremen was strong, but further eastconsiderable progress had been made and Bremen was likely to be out-flanked from the south-east. The United States 9th Army had advanced to the line of the Elbe from Wittenberge to a point south ofMagdeburg. Substantial progress had been made in Saxony, andit seemed likely that the United States Forces in this sector wouldlink up with the Russians and split the German armies into two.The Ruhr pocket had been further compressed and 120,000 prisoners had been taken there during the week.The total number of prisoners for the week was 250,00.0 and forthe period since the crossing of the Rhine 500,000.The arrangements for sending food into Holland on its liberation-tion had been reviewed. There were no reports of food shortages in rural areas in occupied Germany; but the release of the foreignlabour, on whom the Germans had depended for much of their agricultural work, was likely to lead to shortages later in the year.Industrial production in Germany was virtually at a standstill.The 8th Army had made a considerable advance on their whole front. Some progress had also been made in the centre towardsBologna and in the extreme west; and a total of 6,500 prisoners hadbeen taken during the week.The 20th Division had moved southward from the Mandalayarea and was now advancing towards Magwe and Taungdwingyi.This advance.might well isolate considerable enemy forces.The Russian advance west of Vienna continued, and it seemed likely that the Russians would eventually join up with the Allied,armies now advancing towards Nuremberg. Except for a smallattack in the Konigsberg area, Russian activity had been confined tothe South.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.
271W.M. 45 (45).Attacks by rockets and flying Bombs.(previous reference:.W.M. (45)41stConclusions,Minute 1.)The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security s&amp;idthat the War Cabinet might like to have the total casualties sufferedin this country from attacks by flying bombs and long-range rockets.These were as follows : Flying Bombs-from 12th/13th June, 1944 :-Killed ...      ...... 6,184Seriouslv injured   ...      ......    iv-journey,     Slightly injured    ...Total, killed and injured    ...    48,658Long-Range Rockets-^irom 13th&quot; September, 1944Killed    . ...      ...      ....      2,754Seriously injured   ......      ...      6,523Slightly injured    ...      ......     15,438,   &apos; Total, killed and injured    ...    24,715A general statement was now under preparation, covering thetotal casualties and damage suffered as a result of all forms of enemy attack on this country throughout the war. This woulddistinguish between air raids, flying bombs and long-range rockets.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Death ofPresidentRoosevelt.Memorial- Service.(previous reference:W.M.(45)44thConclusions,Minute 1.)3.. The Home Secretary said a Memorial Service for president roosevelt. was to be held in St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral on Tuesday, the17th April. The B.B.C. desired to broadcast both to this countryand to the United States a commentary on the Service, in the courseof which they would wish to announce that His Majesty The king was present. This would be contrary to the existing rule restricting the publication of news relating to The King&apos;s movements. there seemed, however, to be no risk in disclosing The King&apos;s presence onthis occasion, through the broadcast commentary; and the HomeSecretary was disposed to recommend that, subject to The KingVpleasure, the proposed broadcast should be allowed.The Chief of the Air Staff confirmed that this proposalinvolved no risk from the point of view of possible air attack.The suggestion was made that some. opportunity should begiven for the whole nation to pay tribute to President Roosevelt,possibly by observing two minutes&apos; silence at some point while the memorial Service was in progress.There was general support for the proposal for a nation-widetribute, but it was pointed out that in the short time available itmight not- be possible to make effective arrangements for a twominutes&apos; silence, and it was suggested as an alternative that arrange-ments might be made for the tolling of bells throughout the country at. a prearranged time, possibly at the end of the Memorial Service..The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, subject to His Majesty&apos;s pleasure, ho objection&apos; need be raised to the broadcasting of a commentary onthe-Memorial Service.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to report to them at their meeting later in the day what arrangements might bemade to enable the nation as a whole to join in paying a tribute to President Roosevelt at the time of the memorial Service.
4. In the course of the discussion recorded in the preceding minute, it was pointed out that, if the B.B.C. were allowed to broadcast a commentary on the ceremony disclosing that The king was present, the newspapers would protest if they continued to berequired to observe the existing rule by which The King&apos;s movementscould not be publicly reported until a specified time after they hadtaken place.Some discussion followed on the question whether the time hadnot now come when this restriction could safely be withdrawn.The Chief of the Air Staff doubted whether it was necessaryto maintain the existing rule, so far as concerned risks of enemy air attacks.The War Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to ascertain His Majesty&apos;views on this question and to consider, in consultation withthe Minister of Information and . other ministers concerned, whether the existing rule restricting thepublication of news of The King&apos;s movements could now be withdrawn.Of/ices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,Wth April, 1945.News ofHis Majesty&apos;sMovements.RestrictionsonPublication.
