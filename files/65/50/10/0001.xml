The Budget. 1.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicated to the(Previous War Cabinet particulars of the proposals in the forthcomingReference: Budget.W.M.(44)54th In accordance with precedent, details are not recorded in theConclusions.) War Cabinet Conclusions.2. The Lord Privy Seal said that the provisions of the Parlia-ment (Elections and Meetings) Act, 1943, requiring that votersmust themselves apply to be registered as business premises votershad, as he had feared, produced the result that very few of thoseentitled to vote in respect of business premises had taken thenecessary steps to get their names on the register. In Gateshead,for example, out of more than 600 who were entitled to vote inrespect of business premises, only five had placed their names on theregister. In these circumstances he suggested that the Law officers should now be invited to consider whether it would be possible,without amendment of the existing law, to extend the time duringwhich business voters could apply to be registered.The Home Secretary said that in some constituencies special efforts had been made to see that business voters made the necessaryapplication. He agreed, however, that over the country as a wholeit was likely that the business voters&apos; register was very far from complete. He was willing to adopt the suggestion made by the lord privy Seal.The War Cabinet-Took note that the Home Secretary would invite the LawOfficers to consider whether it would be possible, withoutamendment of the existing law, to extend the time withinwhich voters might apply for registration on the business premises register.BusinessVoters&apos;Register.(previous reference:W.M. (45) 8thConclusions,Minute 5.)Parliament. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the electoral Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (W.P. (45)Reform. .215) submitting proposals for an Electoral (Miscellaneous(Previous       Provisions) Bill.Reference: The first of these proposals related to the legal maximum scaleW.M. (44) 144th of candidates&apos; expenses. At their meeting on the 1st November,Conclusions, 1944, the War Cabinet had agreed that effect should be given to the minute 1.) recommendations of the Speaker&apos;s Conference that the legalElectoral maximum should be a basic figure of  450 with an additional(Miscellaneous allowance of l^d. for each elector in a county constituency and Id.Provisions) for each elector in a borough constituency. This recommendationBill. had been discussed informally with the Chief Party Agents whohad expressed the view that, while this maximum should in normaltime suffice to enable elections to be properly contested, somepercentage increase would be justified for elections in the earlypost-war years when the cost of printing and paper would beabnormally high. It was therefore recommended in the Memo-randum that the maximum (including the agent&apos;s fees) proposed bythe Speaker&apos;s Conference should be adopted, with a proviso that forthe next General Election (and any subsequent bye-election until thesecond General Election after the war) there should be allowed anadditional 25 per cent, overall increase, to be calculated for eachconstituency on the basic figure of  450 plus the allowance for each-elector.The Lord Privy Seal said that expenses properly incurred incontesting the next General Election would be abnormally high; notonly because of the increased cost of paper and printing, but also because the political organisation throughout the country had notbeen used for a General&quot; Election for so long a time. He would therefore prefer that, at the next-General Election, the scale of
Candidates&apos; expenses should be governed by the provisions of theexisting law.In discussion it was pointed out that there was a substantial body of opinion among members of all political parties in favour ofthe recommendations of the Speaker &apos;s Conference on this point, anda general expectation that legislation to give effect to them wouldbe passed before the General Election. : On the other hand, it was recognised that some time had passed since the Report of the speaker&apos;s Conference was made; and the proposals made in theMemorandum now before the War Cabinet in fact involved some modification of those recommendations.After discussion it was generally agreed that it would bedesirable,  before proceeding with these proposals,  toascertain the views of the Members of Parliament who had- served on the Speaker&apos;s Conference.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to the recom-mendation made in Section IV of W.P. (45) 215 that an additionalregister should be published in the spring of 1946. This would cost about  750,000 and would be necessary only if there were a secondGeneral Election in 1946, and the register published in October1945 proved to be unsatisfactory. He wondered whether this additional expense was justified.The general view of the War Cabinet was that, in view of the substantial movements of population which were likely to take placein 1945, it would be expedient to provide for. the publication of asecond register in the spring of 1946.The War Cabinel^-(1) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland to hold informal consultations with theMembers of Parliament who had served on the Speaker&apos;conference and with the Chief Party Agents, with aview to ascertaining their views on the proposals madein Section I (a) and (b) of W.P. (45) 215 regarding themaximum scale of candidates&apos; expenses in the next general Election and any subsequent bye-election untilthe second General Election; and to report the resultsof these consultations to the War Cabinet;(2) Agreed to postpone further consideration of the remainingproposals in W.P. (45) 215 until they had before them areport on the consultations authorised by Conclusion (1)above.-General 4.

Would it not be more equitable to wait until all candidatesin the Forces could be released simultaneously.\   -   [29935-3] b 2 .
GeneralElection.Release ofStaff forElectoralRegistrationOfficers andReturningOfficers.(previous reference:W.M.(45)36thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. At their meeting on the 26th March the War Cabinet had approved proposals for securing the temporary release of personsserving in the Armed Forces in this country who belonged to thepermanent staffs of Registration and Returning Officers, and whose services were regarded as essential for the proper conduct of theGeneral Election.The War Cabinet had agreed to review the position if itappeared that these measures would not suffice to provide a numberof experienced persons sufficient to avoid the risk of a breakdown in the arrangements for the Election.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (W.P. (45)247) reporting that from the information now available it appeared that an adequate number of experienced persons would not beavailable unless some men serving overseas could be released for thispurpose. The War Cabinet was therefore asked to agree that where the Home Office or Scottish Office were satisfied that therelease of a man serving overseas was required for the purposes ofthe Election, he should be temporarily released for this purposeunless in any individual case there were over-riding operationalobjections.The Minister of Labour and National Service explained that hehad hitherto felt unable to assent to this proposal. He was being pressed from all quarters to release men from the Forces; and he andthe Service Ministers had been most anxious to avoid releasing menfrom overseas in view of the risk of causing discontent in the forces and prejudicing the smooth working of the demobilisation scheme.He had also felt some doubt, in view of the time which had passedsince the last General Election, whether the men whose release was desired had in fact had practical experience of registration work.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the-Government hada direct responsibility for the efficient conduct of the election, and could not reasonably withhold from those in charge of the officialmachine the facilities which had already been granted to the party organisations.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal made in paragraph 2 of W.P. (45)247, on the understanding that the Home Office and scottish office would not sponsor any application unless they were. fully satisfied that the man concerned had special qualifica-tions for the work for which his services were required, andthat applications for the release of men serving in the,South-East Asia theatre would not be pressed withoutfurther reference to the War Cabinet.As against this it was pointed out that elected Members ofParliament were free to return from the Forces to their Parlia-mentary duties; and it was the general view that the time had come when the same right should be extended to adopted candidates.The War Cabinet-Agreed that Members of Parliament should now be reminded of their right to resume their parliamentary duties at any time they think fit; and that at the same timeimmediate steps should be taken to enable candidates who&apos;had been adopted for the General Election to securetemporary release from the Armed Forces, on theconditions indicated in W.P. (45) 255, subject to over-riding military objections on operational grounds to therelease of any particular individual.
285 W.M. m (45).General 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the ChancellorEleotion. of the Exchequer (W.P. (45) 241) covering a Report to the LordPaper. Presidents Committee on the provision of paper for the GeneralElection.The Report proposed global allocations of paper to PartyHeadquarters for central purposes, and also allocations to individualcandidates.In discussion the view was expressed that further consideration should be given to the allocations to Party Headquarters Tor centralpurposes, with a view to securing that these allocations should beara rather closer relationship to the total number of candidatesadopted by each of the principal Parties. It was suggested that,for this purpose, each of the principal Parties should make avail-able, to the body of Ministers responsible for considering thismatter, particulars of the total number of candidates already adopted, or in regard to whom adoption arrangements were alreadyfar advanced. The allocations might have to be weighted somewhatin respect of the smaller Parties; but unless due regard was paidto the total number of candidates there was a risk that Parties whichran a small number of candidates would obtain an advantage overthe.Parties which ran a large number of candidates in regard to the quantities of literature which could be made available from PartyHeadquarters to each constituenty.It was pointed out that some difficulty might arise from thefact that the total number of candidates would not be known untilshortly before nomination day, and that work would have to be putin hand by each Party Headquarters on its election literature some weeks before this date. It was suggested that this difficulty couldbe got .over by making an initial allocation to each Party on thebasis of the number of candidates which it expected to run, subjectto an undertaking that literature.would not be issued for use in the constituencies in excess of the proportion of that allocation due inrespect of the candidates actually adopted.This view met with general acceptance, and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer was invited to consider, in conjunction with theMinisters concerned, the practical arrangements to give effect to it.offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,20th April, 1945.
