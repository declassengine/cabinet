Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,27th April, 1945.World At their meeting on the 28th March the War Cabinet hadOrganisation, decided that they could; not accede to Sir Walter Citrine&apos;s requestTrades Union that representatives of the Trades Union Congress should beRepresents- officially attached to the British delegation at the San Franciscotion at Conference.San Francisco        The War Cabinet now had before them a telegram (No. 25- Conference.     dated 27th April) from the Deputy Prime Minister and the(Previous       Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at San Francisco, reportingReference:      that Sir Walter Citrine and Mr. E. Edwards had again urged on W.M.(45)37th them that T.U.C. representatives should be appointed as officialConclusions,    advisers to the British delegation.   The essence of their demand. Minute i.)      was, not facilities for unofficial consultation, but the admission ofthe right of the T.U.C. to have official status at this and subsequentinternational conferences and to be consulted, not only on social and economic questions, but on such matters as economic sanctions and reparations.   Sir Walter Citrine had threatened that, if hisdemand was not conceded, he would return to this country and raisethe whole matter as a first-class issue.   The Deputy Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary had undertaken to transmit this furtherrequest to the War Cabinet, but had held out ho hope that the WarCabinet would modify their previous decision.It was the view of the War Cabinet that no ground had been advanced for modifying their decision of the 28th March. Thequestions under discussion at San Francisco were matters forGovernments, on which His Majesty&apos;s Government could not sharetheir responsibility with bodies not accountable to Parliament. Itwould, in any event, be most undesirable to appear to be yielding toa threat.The War CabinetsInvited the Prime Minister to inform the Deputy PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary that their telegram had been considered at a special meeting of the WarCabinet, who saw no reason to depart from their decisionof the 28th March that representatives of the T.U.C. couldnot be officially attached to the British delegation. It, was, of course, understood that our delegation would continue to be ready to hear the views of the T.U.C.representatives at San Francisco, and to consult them on labour matters, during the course of the Conference.
