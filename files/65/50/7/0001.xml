The Prime-Minister said.that the War Cabinet would have heard With profound sorrow of the sudden death of president roosevelt. He himself felt a deep sense of personal loss. But heshared with the War Cabinet, and with the country as a whole,in their sorrow at the loss of a world statesman who had used his great influence to give staunch and solid support to the Britishcause from the very earliest days of the war. President R6osevelt&apos;&quot;sdeath at this moment, when the war in Europe was fast moving toa close and the problems of the peace settlement were looming ahead,would be universally mourned throughout the United Nations.The Prime Minister understood that the funeral services, in washington and at Hyde Park, would be simple, and there wouldbe no State funeral. He thought, however, that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should attend; and this view was endorsed by the War Cabinet.The House of Commons had adjourned that morning, as a mark of respect; and, when Parliament reassembled on Tuesday, the17th April, resolutions would be moved in both Houses, in accord-ance with the precedents applicable on the death of the Head of aState.

The leaders of the principal parties had expressed the wish that there should be no other speeches.The War Cabinet agreed that this would be the most appropriateprocedure.The King had intimated that Their Majesties would begraciously ^pleased to attend a Memorial Service on the morning of Tuesday, the 17th April. Some discussion followed on thequestion whether this Service should be held in St. Paul&apos;s Cathedralor in Westminster Abbey. While Westminster Abbey would be themore convenient, it was thought that precedents might require that a Memorial Service for the Head of a foreign State should beheld in St. Paul&apos;s. It was agreed that the Home Secretary should determine this question in accordance with the precedents.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Chief Whip would arrange, in the lightof the War Cabinet&apos;s views and in consultation with&apos; the authorities of the House of Commons, details of theprocedure to be followed in moving the resolution on tuesday, the 17th April. The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs would arrange for a similar procedure to be followed in the House of Lords.(2) Invited the Home Secretary in consultation with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to make thearrangements for the Memorial Service to be held on tuesday, the 17th April.2. The Prime Minister said that, in view of the immediatedeparture of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to attendPresident Roosevelt&apos;s funeral in the United States, it would benecessary to modify the arrangements for the debates in the Houseof Commons in the following week.He proposed that the deba.te on Tuesday, the 17th April inconnection with the San Francisco Conference on World Organisa-tion should be opened by the Deputy Prime Minister. He would himself be.ready, if necessary, to reply to that debate.The Prime Minister said that he would take charge of the debate on Thursday, the 19th April, on Poland and Foreign Affairs.3, The. War Cabinet discussed Marshal Stalin&apos;s reply to the representations made to him about the arrangements for the recon-stitution of the Polish Governmert.The discussion is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File ofWar Cabinet Conclusions.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,13th April, 1945.
