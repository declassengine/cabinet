Arrangements The Prirme Minister informed the War Cabinet that at 2-41 a.m.in Connection that morning General Eisenhower had received at his Headquarterswith the End the unconditional surrender of all German forces in Europe. Theof Hostilities instrument of surrender had been signed by representatives of thein Europe. German High Command and the surrender was made simultaneously(Previous to the Allied Expeditionary Force and the Soviet High Command.Reference: By the terms of the surrender hostilities would formally cease oneW.M.(45)58th minute after midnight on 8th/9th May.Conclusions, General Eisenhower had originally suggested that the surrenderMinute 9.) should be announced by the Governments of the three Great PowersOfficial simultaneously on Tuesday, the 8th May.   The Prime Minister hadAnnouncement then proposed to President Truman and Marshal Stalin that theof German announcement should be made on the 8th May, at 3 p.m. inSurrender.      this country, at 9 a.m. in Washington, and at 4 p.m. in Moscow.This proposal had been accepted by President Truman, and marshal Stalin. Early that morning, however, General Eisenhowerhad expressed the view that it would be impossible to keep the newssecret until the 8th May as orders to German troops would be broadcast en clair during the 7th May. He had therefore urgedthat the announcement by Governments should be made at the earliestpossible moment. In the light of this message the Prime minister had proposed to President Truman and Marshal Stalin that theannouncement should be made here-at 6 p.m. on the 7th May (12 noonin Washington and 7 p.m. in Moscow). During the course of theday he had had several telephone conversations with Washington.President Truman had been unwilling to agree to the proposed change in the time of the announcement unless Marshal Stalin con-- &quot; curred; and he had adhered to this view even when it was pointedout to him that the Germans had announced full details of the surrender and that news of this was being broadcast throughout theworld by the Columbia Broadcasting Service. A few minutes before p.m. a further message had been received from Washington; fromwhich it appeared that, as Marshal Stalin did not concur in thechange proposed, President Truman would not make any announce-ment in Washington-until 3 p,.m. on the 8th May, even thoughthe Prime Minister should decide to make his announcement inLondon at 6 p.m. on the 7th May. In these circumstances thePrime Minister had decided that it would be inexpedient to proceedwith his plan for announcing the news at 6 p.m. that evening. Inview, of the numerous reports which were being broadcast through-out the world, he thought it unfortunate that the official announce-ment should be delayed, and he thought it a matter for special regret that the public in this country should be deprived of the oppor-tunity for spontaneous celebration of the victory - but, on balance, hehad thought it preferable to avoid the risk of a reproach fromMarshal Stalin for haying departed from the arrangementspreviously agreed between the three Powers.The War Cabinet endorsed the decision which the PrimeMinister had taken. At the same time, they felt that, as the news had become so widely known on an unofficial basis, it was necessaryto give some guidance to the public and, in particular, to let it be known whether workers should proceed to work on the following day.  After discussion,The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Information to arrange for anannouncement to be broadcast forthwith in the following terms :-&quot; It is understood that in accordance with arrange-ments between the three Great Powers an official announcement will be broadcast by the Prime Ministerat 3 o&apos; clock to-morrow, Tuesday afternoon, the 8th May.In view of this fact to-morrow, Tuesday, will be treatedas Victory in Europe Day and will be regarded as aholiday. The day following, Wednesday, the 9th May,will also be a holiday.   His Majesty The Kiner will
broadcast to the peoples of the British Empire and commonwealth to-morrow, Tuesday, at 9 p.m. Par-liament will meet at the usual time to-morrow. &quot;*Broadast by The War Cabinet were informed that General de Gaulle was general de intending to announce the German surrender in a broadcast atGaulle. 8 o&apos;clock that evening. It was agreed that General de Gaulle shouldbe informed of the plans for synchronising the announcements bythe Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States andthe U.S.S.R., and advised to postpone his announcement until acorresponding hour on the 8th May. If, however, he was unwilling to accept this advice no further pressure could be brought to bearon him.The War Cabinet-(2) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for a message onthese lines to be conveyed to General de Gaulle.Parliament. The Prime Minister said that, immediately after making hisbroadcast announcement on the 8th May, he would go to the Houseof Commons and ask leave to interrupt the business for the purposeof repeating the announcement which he had made on the wireless.Thereafter he would propose that the House should adjourn for a service of Thanksgiving in St. magaret&apos;s, Westminster. similar arrangements would be made in the House of Lords.Later in the afternoon His Majesty The King desired toreceive in audience the members of the War Cabinet and the Chiefsof Staff.The War Cabinets(3) Invited the Secretary to ensure that the authorities in bothHouses of Parliament were informed that arrangements should be made for the Services of Thanksgiving inSt. Margaret&apos;s, Westminster, and Westminster Abbey tobe held during the afternoon on the 8th May.Thanksgiving The Home Secretary said that, in accordance with the proposalsService in       approved by the War Cabinet on the 9th April, arrangements hadSt. Paul&apos;s       been made to invite a fully representative congregation to theCathedral.       Thanksgiving Service which was to be held at St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral(Previous       on Sunday, the 13th May.   The question had now been raisedReference:      whether Members of both Houses of Parliament should be invitedW.M.(45)4lst  to this Service.  He had assumed that this would be unnecessary, as conclusions,    each House of Parliament was to have its own Service of Thanks-Minute,6.)      giving on the 8th May and most Members of Parliament would wishto be free on the following Sunday to attend Services of Thanks-giving in their constituencies.   He had therefore proposed that members of Parliament should not be invited to the Service at st.. Paul&apos;s.The general view of the War Cabinet was that Members ofParliament could not properly be excluded from this Service. Whileseats could not be reserved for any large number of Members,without displacing some of the other groups who should be repre-sented at the Service, it should be possible to reserve about 100 seatsfor Members of the two Houses of Parliament.The War Cabinet-(4) Invited the Home Secretary to consider, in consultationwith the authorities of the two Houses of Parliament,whether facilities could not be given for about 100Members of both Houses to attend the ThanksgivingService in St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral. -Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,7th May, 1945.
