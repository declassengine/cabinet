The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it was most important to make certain that we had an agreed policy inregard to action in Syria, more particularly as the negotiations nowgoing on in Paris between Admiral Darlan and the Germans mightwell concern the passage of German troops through Syria.[22499]b 2
On the suggestion of the Prime Minister, the War cabinet agreed that this matter should be dealt with at a meeting of theDefence Committee (Operations) that evening. The Chiefs of staff had already been asked to submit a report.United States. 4.   The War Cabinet agreed that there was no reason why theUnited States Foreign Secretary should not accede to a proposal made by the embassy.

A short discussion took place, and is recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.7. The Foreign Secretary thought that Stalin&apos;s open assump-tion of power showed that he realised the clouds were gathering.Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to think that Russia would resist any German demands except those which would affect Stalin&apos;position at home.8. The Minister of Home Security gave the following information : Night, 5th/6th May. About 250 aircraft had been over this country, of which 150 had attacked Clydeside. Casualtiesso far reported on Clydeside were 57 killed and 95 injured.Belfast, Merseyside and Tyneside had also been attacked.Night, 6th/7th May.  About 260 aircraft had attackedthis country. The main attacks had been on Clydeside, Mersey-side, Tyneside and Tees-side.Night, 7th/8th May. Two hundred enemy aircraft hadbeen in operation, the main objective being Merseyside, wherethere had been extensive fires in the docks. Hull, manchester and Bristol had also been attacked, and there had been seriousfires at all these places. The danger from fire was clearly veryserious and the importance of defeating the night bomber could hardly be over-estimated.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Shipping.Publication ofShipping Losses.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 45thConclusions,Minute 4.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (41) 99) to which were annexed (i) A draft Press notice announcing the merchant shipping losses in April.(ii) A statement showing the monthly losses since May 1940.The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that the figuresof losses of munitions from the United States of America whilecrossing the Atlantic (which we had so far refused to publish) had become known to certain circles in the United States of America andwere being used to our detriment.
Civil Defence. 10.   The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the fire Brigade Minister of Home Security and the Secretary of State for ScotlandServices^ (W.P. (41) 97 and 98).(Previous j,jlg jjome Secretary and Minister of Home Security emphasised-WM (401309th sisec* tnat tne stage had now been reached where an effectiveConclusions       improvement in the Services could only be brought about by settingMinute 8 1 &apos;      up a national fire-fighting machine.   The process of local amalga-lnu e mations was too slow and did not provide a solution to the problem as a whole. The additional charge on the Exchequer which wouldresult from these arrangements would not be very large, and thefinancial arrangements set out in the Memorandum had been agreed with the Treasury. Provided that the principle of a nationalservice in war time was accepted, he thought that some modificationsconsistent with that principle could be agreed in the application ofthe scheme to Scotland. He was advised that legislation would benecessary; but he thought it would be best to proceed by means ofa short Bill, in general terms, leaving the detailed application to beeffected by Defence Regulations.The Secretary of State for Scotland accepted the basicargument advanced by the Home Secretary. There were certain areas in Scotland in which powers of compulsory amalgamationor supersession were necessary. Many of the County Councils inScotland were fire authorities, and most of them had efficient fire-fighting organisations, although they had not been so severely testedas in England. He thought that it was very important to carry thelocal authorities with them in this matter. This would involve con-siderable discretion as to arrangements for unification and central control which should be applied to certain areas of Scotland whichhad efficient fire organisations.It was agreed in discussion that it should be made clear that itwas not intended, at any rate at present, to deal with other civil defence Services on the same lines as those now proposed for the fire-fighting Services.He suggested that the announcement of the April shipping losses should take the form of a table of shipping losses month bymonth from May 1940 up to and including April. The figure forthe latter month should not distinguish between losses in the North-Western Approaches, in the Mediterranean or other theatres,though it should be stated that the global figure of April lossescovered all theatres, including the Mediterranean.The War Cabinet-Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to submit to thePrime Minister (i) A revised draft notice for publication on the lines suggested above,(ii) Material   for   a   personal   telegram   to   president roosevelt.   This should include (a) particulars showing the number of ships sunkcarrying munitions from the United States.The statement should draw attention to thefact that, although not many ships had been sunk, the cargoes lost had been of value;(b) particulars of the number of ships damaged,emphasising the damage which had occurred in our ports.
The War Cabinet-(1) Gave general approval to the scheme for reorganisation ofthe Fire-fighting Services in England and Wales set outin W.P. (41) 97.(2) Agreed that, while in principle this scheme should also apply to Scotland, discretion should be left to the twoSecretaries of State to modify it in its application tocertain Scottish fire authorities. i(3) Authorised the Home Secretary and Minister of Home 9Security to arrange for the preparation of the necessary legislation, and agreed that, if possible, this legislation should be framed in general terms, detailed measuresbeing embodied in Defence Regulations to be made there under.Great George Street, S.W. 1,May 8, 1941.

Some 200-250 Germanheavy tanks together with a large number of lighttanks were now in North Africa,     General Wavellpossessedbnly some 100 heavy tanks although 50 more were coming out of the workshops in Egypt at the endof this month.     The dispatch of further tanks round the Cape would take a very long time.     It had,therefore, been decided to run the great risk of sending tank reinforcements to General Wavell throughthe Mediterranean.     These reinforcements consisted of S06 tanks, of which 87 were cruiser tanks, 49 lighttanks and the balance I tanks.      In addition we were sending out in the Convoy about 50 Hurricane aircraft,and considerable quantities of guns, vehicles,ammunition supplies and other stores.     Thisvaluable cargo was being carried in five ships, whichsteamed at the rate of 14-g- knots.    The convoy was atthe present moment in the danger zone.     The admiralty and the Air Ministry had made most careful plans forthe convoy&apos;s escort.The Prime Minister continuing said that should the whole of these reinforcements succeed in reaching General Wavell, he would have over 400 heavytanks at his disposal, a number far in exdess of theGerman tank strength.     With this force the militarysituation in North Africa might be turned to our advantage.     No military personnel had been includedin the convoy, but trained tank personnel was availablein Egypt to man the tanks.THE FIRST SEA LORD gave particulars of thearrangements made for the escort .of this Convoythrough the Mediterranean.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that if the tank reinforcements arrived safelyin Egypt, it would not be possible to put them straightinto a battle as it would take some little time to runthem in.Referring to the military situation in theWestern Desert, the PRIME MINISTER said that it wouldseem as if the German advance had not only been held up but had for the moment come to a stand-still.   from certain information it looked as if the enemy wasshort of ammunition, petrol and food, and was feelingthe effects of the hard weather conditions.     with good fortune the Battle of Egypt might well turn inour favour.     The risks taken in this operation were very great;   but the operation would justify itselfif half this equipment could be got safely through to egypt.THE MIDDLE EAST.eration &quot;Tiger&quot;,l(previous reference:W.M.(4l) 41stConclusions,Minute 2.)Great George Street, S.W.I.
