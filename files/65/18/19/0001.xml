We had also attacked transport in this area.Shipping casualties since the meeting of the War Cabinet onthe 10th April had been : Ships lost- -By submarine : 1 ship ... j aboufc   SQQQ t(yQSBy aircraft: 1 ship to this must be added belatedreports of two ships sunkShips damaged-&apos;By submarine.: 3 ships by aircraft: ? 5 shipsabout 7,000 tons,about 15,000 tons.I about 56,000 tons.In accordance with the decisions reached the previous week,no weekly list of shipping losses would be published on the following day. The public reply to any Press enquiries as to the change should be that the figures would in future be published monthly.But the Press might be informed, in confidence, of the reasons forthe change on the basis of the draft statement agreed by the Ministerof Information with the Admiralty and the Ministry of Shipping.H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Rajpuiana had been torpedoedon the 13th April, 150 miles West-North-West of Iceland, and hadbeen abandoned. 277 survivors had been picked up. Two had been killed and 44 were missing.The Prime Minister said that it was for serious consideration whether the Admiralty should not release a considerable number ofthe vessels now employed as Armed Merchant Cruisers, and whichwould be very valuable for our import programme.The Germans had occupied North Yugoslavia. Their front ranroughly along the line of the River Sava. In front of this line theyhad taken Karlovac. The main line of their advance was likely tobe by Sarajevo and Mostar to the Adriatic.There were unconfirmed reports that the Yugoslavs had occupied Durazzo, but their advance against the Italians in Albaniahad been disappointing.General Wilson&apos;s Force was holding its own against heavyGerman attacks. There had been hard fighting at Vevi.
Libya.Eritrea and abyssinia.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 38thConclusions,Minute 1.)Our troops at Tobruk had beaten off two attacks, but the enemy had occupied Sollum.There was no further news of military operations. A telegram had been received that the military authorities thought that theEmperor Haile Selassie&apos;s return to Addis Ababa should be post-poned since, for the present, the town must remain in military occupation.Further detailed information as to the operations in the balkans and the Middle East is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Iraq.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 36thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The War Cabinet were informed that, as a result of the deterioration in the position, the Government of India had beenasked to send troops to secure Basra. The Government of india had undertaken to send a force comprising three brigades. Thefirst convoy was now on the way. Several of H.M. ships were already at Basra, and others were on the way.The question arose whether we should notify Rashid Ali thatwe proposed to land troops or should land without warning. Wehad the right under our Treaty to pass troops through Iraq onnotice being given. If we gave notice, this would afford Rashid Alian opportunity of giving orders that our troops should be allowedto land unopposed.The matter had been considered that afternoon by a Meetingunder the Chairmanship of the Secretary of State for India, whichhad recommended that our Ambassador should approach RashidAli, claiming treaty right of entry, and offering provisional recog-nition in return, but making it clear that we meant to land in anycase. He should have discretion what notice he should give, but should allow little time for counter-preparations. The Committeeadded that the naval covering and air demonstration from Shaibashould enable a landing to be made against such emergency opposi-tion as might be offered.The Chief of the Air Staff raised the question of what instruc-tions should be given the Air Officer Commanding Air Forces inIraq, whose headquarters were at Habbaniya. Clearly he would beentitled to use force to resist any attack on the Royal Air Forcestation at Habbaniya. But should he threaten or, if necessary,employ force against Baghdad, in order to overawe the Iraqis. He(the Chief of the Air Staff) proposed that the Air Officer Command-ing should be instructed to act in this matter in consultation withour Ambassador until the General Officer Commanding in charge ofthe troops from India had landed, and thereafter should act,inconsultation with the General Officer Commanding.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendation at &quot; A &quot; above, that our ambassador should give notice to Rashid Ali on thelines proposed of our intention to land troOps, andshould have discretion as to the amount of notification tobe given.(2) Invited the Chief of the Air Staff to concert with theForeign Secretary the terms of the instructions to besent to the Air Officer Commanding, Habbaniya, on thelines indicated.Great George Street, S.W. 1,.    April 14,; .1941.
