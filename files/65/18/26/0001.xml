It had been evacuated and petrol dumps set on fireby our troops.At Tobruk we held the whole of the perimeter except part of.the west side. The Germans had used flame-throwers for the first-time in this area. &apos;;   &apos;-&apos;&apos;-) &apos;The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 45thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Minister of Home Security said that Merseyside had suffered from air attacks on the previous four nights, the attacks onthe Saturday and Sunday being particularly heavy.The casualties at Merseyside had been: Friday: Killed, 105; Injured, 191.Saturday (estimated): Killed, 463; Injured, 734.Sunday : No report available.Repeated attacks on towns of moderate size presented manydifficult problems. At Plymouth, for example, many people had to evacuate the town at night as no living quarters were available, butthey found that most of the billets outside the town were filled withevacuees from London. The question of reserving a belt round suchtowns free from evacuees from other parts of the country was being examined.Other places attacked during the last four nights includedPortsmouth, Tyneside, Barrow-in-Furness and Belfast.[22486]
I*i4.wn,r- r,i g2%? Secretary of &apos;State for Foreign Affairs said that(Previous        various offers of mediation between ourselves and Iraq had been reference:        received, but had been declined.   That morning he had seen theW.M. (41) 45th Iraqi Charge- d&apos;Affaires and had told him that if matters continuedConclusions,      his country would be at war with the Whole of the British Empire,Minute 3.)       and if German help was received Iraq would be turned into a battle-field.   The Charge d&apos;Affaires had asked for a statement of ourposition and had been told that; in the first place, they must ceaseattacking us at Habbaniya and elsewhere, and that when hostilitiesceased, while we were determined to maintain our treaty rights, wewould he ready to discuss their fulfilment.   The Charge d&apos;Affaireshad promised to communicate this information to his Government.In reply to a question, the Foreign Secretary said that he had left it to our Ambassador in Ankara to decide whether he should&quot;     suggest to the Turks.that they should occupy Mosul.Spain.(previous reference erence  :W.M. (41) &apos;41stConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that it was believed that therewould be changes in the Spanish Government, ami that, althoughSenbr Siiftcr would remain as Foreign Secretary, the changes wouldbe to our advantage. This should not &apos;be emphasised in the Press,who should be asked to make no comment on the -changes.The War Cabinet took note of the above information.Blockade 5.   The Minister for Economic Warfare reminded the WarFrance. Cabinet that we had resisted proposal made by the United StatesFood Supplies State Department in February last to send food to unoccupiedfor TUnoociipied France. On the-4th March they had returned to the charge, and weFrance. had agreed to the sailing of two wheat ships, subject to assurances(Previous that the entry of further Germans into French Africa should be reference;:        forbidden, the activities of the Armistice Commission limited, andW.M. (41) 30th certain British Consular Officers allowed to return.Conclusions, When the Vichy-German barter agreement had been made.Minute 3.)       towards the end of March, whereby Vichy was to obtain 800,000 tonsof wheat against certain foodstuffs from the unoccupied zone, wehad pressed the United States Government to drop the proposals forfurther supplies, but had indicated that we would adhere to our, decision to let these two cargoes proceed.On the 28th March the State Department had told us that they:     intended these two ships to proceed, hut did not contemplateapproaching tas further for the present as regards shipments toFrance.On the 30th April our Ambassador had been informed by thei   State Department that they had agreed in principle with a proposal of the French Government that two further wheat ships should besent to unoccupied France as soon as possible, by early July at the:        latest, and that the United States Government should have complete-     control of the disposal of the wheat and facilities for appointing: &apos; \ controllers.   It appeared that the United States government intended to send further shipments :(two ships at a time) on similar&apos;&apos; &apos; - lines, if a satisfactory report was received on the distribution of the.;  &quot; first two cargoes.Looked at from the blockade point of view, we had made&apos;     ;:l        concessions without any substantial quid pro quo.  The attitude ofthe State Department in making this arrangement without prior consulation with us was hardly consistent with the previous negotiations on the matter.On the other hand, the Prime Minister pointed out that, owingto other demands on our Naval forces, we were not maintaining an effective blockade of unoccupied France.  After discussion between
the Ministers concerned, it had been decided not to take a stiff line with the United States Government on the matter. Lord Halifaxhad been instructed to say that we hoped that the United StatesGovernment would not think it necessary to despatch these two ships&apos;at once, and that no publicity should be given to the contemplatedshipments for the present. He should also say that we attached importance to the appointment of controllers in order to introduce a body of observers into unoccupied France.The War Cabinet took note of, and endorsed, the line ofaction taken in these instructions.Gibraltar. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theEvacuation of Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (41) 96). The GovernorCivilians.

As many as possible of the remaining 1,800 should be brought here in a shipor ships which should be diverted to Gibraltar for thispurpose on the homeward journey from the Middle East.(2) The possibility of providing an escort for a ship carryingout this duty should be settled between the Sea TransportDivision of the Ministry of Shipping and the Operations(Foreign) Division of the Admiralty.(3) The remaining civilians in Gibraltar should be evacuated,as they could be spared, and as shipping could be madeavailable. This would probably mean that they wouldbe sent in small parties.chemical warfare.precautionary measures.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 28thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of a Memo-randum by the Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (41) 94) setting out thefurther action taken to improve precautionary measures.Great George Street, S.W. 1,May 5, 1941.
