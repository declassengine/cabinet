(2) A suggestion put forward by the Foreign Secretary inregard to West Africa.Crete.ProposedDebate in theHouse ofCommons.3. The Prime Minister said that a desire had been expressed that there shouldl be a debate in the following week in the Houseof Commons on the operations in Crete. The debate must takeplace, although his own view was that it did not increase the prestige of the House that a debate should take place on what wasno more than an isolated operation in the middle of a big campaign.As regards procedure he proposed, in reply to a question, toindicate that no Government speech would be made at the openingof the debate, which would be held&apos; in public; but that a speechwould be made by a Government spokesman at the close of theproceedings if the course of the debate made this necessary.[22597]The War Cabinet approved generally the course proposed.b2
^previous reference:W.M. (41) 56thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Prime Minister then reviewed the strategy of theoperations in Crete. He was satisfied that there had been over-whelming justification on military grounds for the course whichhad been adopted.The Dominions Secretary informed the War Cabinet that therewas to be a debate in secret session on Crete in the New ZealandParliament.The War Cabinet invited the Dominions Secretary to consult with the Chiefs of Staff and furnish the NewZealand Government with material for use in the debate.Blockade.French north africa.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theUnited States Government were still pressing us to agree to suppliesbeing sent to French North Africa.The Prime Minister said that as the United States Governmentwere showing interest in this part of the world, and thought thatthey could do something effective if they held out inducements toGeneral Weygand, we should have to fall in with their views.The Foreign Secretary agreed, and said that we should haveto release the Sheherazade, although it was hoped to remove some ofthe oil from the ship before she was released. The United StatesGovernment had been informed of the position in regard to theWinnipeg, jrhich. had also been seized.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.France.relations withthe Vichy-Government.French Fleet.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet had a short discussion, a record of whichis contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Foreign Affairs.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 56th-Conclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave thefollowing information : Russia.An account of his conversation with M. Maisky had! been circulated to the Cabinet. M. Maisky had no knowledge of adeal between Germany and Russia, but it did not follow fromthis that there had not been one. M. Maisky was by no meansshocked when he (the Foreign Secretary) had said thatGermany had plans for attacking Eussia.The Foreign Office view was still that Eussia would make substantial concessions rather than fight Germany.Turkey.The attitude of Turkey at the present moment was as.   stalwart as could be expected.
Middle East.Military Policyin East Africa.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 50thConclusions,Minute 4.)Prisoners ofWar.Proposal tobring 25,000Italianprisoners,to this       a country.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 7thConclusions,Minute 8.)Evacuation.In-and-outmovement of population fromtarget areas.7. The War Cabinet approved the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (41) 114) setting out our military policy for East Africa, and authorised him to send the necessary instructions to the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East. It was understood that the policy in regard to the exercise by the emperor of de facto authority in Ethiopia would fall within the limits ofthe statement which the Foreign Secretary had made in the Houseof Commons on the 4th February, 1941.8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (41) 120) setting out a schemeto bring Italian prisoners of war to this country for agricultural work and work under the War Office.The Foreign Secretary asked that further consideration shouldbe given to the proposal to employ prisoners of war as technicaltradesmen in ordnance works, in order to avoid any breach of theConvention.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air ministry would be glad if some Italian prisoners of war could be assigned to them.The War Cabinet-(i) Approved generally the scheme set out in the lord presidents Memorandum (subject to further considera-tion of the point raised by the Foreign Secretary at&quot;X&quot;), whereby 25,000 Italian prisoners should bebrought to this country, at the rate of about 5,000 amonth.(ii) Agreed that the matter should be reviewed when arrange-ments to bring this number had been completed,(iii) Invited the Lord President of the Council to settle theallocation of prisoners between the Departments, andany other points in the application of the scheme which required inter-Departmental discussion.9. The War Cabinet had before them a joint Memorandum bythe Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security, the Ministerof Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland (W.P. (G) (41) 56).Recent heavy raids had been followed by a considerable unregulatedexodus in a number of places from Liverpool, Bootle, Plymouth,Southampton and Portsmouth, and many people who were nothomeless had made use of the rest centres after heavy attacks.The question at issue was whether the policy of providing restcentres for the homeless should be extended, and official arrange-ments made for persons who were not homeless to leave the targetareas nightly in order to sleep in safer districts.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security and theMinister of Health explained that, in their view, while rest centresmust be provided in sufficient numbers to enable all persons, whetherhomeless or not, to receive food andl shelter after a heavy raid, noother organised arrangements should be made under a government scheme for an in-and-out movement of persons who were nothomeless. To do so would be bad for morale, and would make difficulties in regard to fire-fighting. Further, it was difficult tosee how, if an exception was made in respect of any particular classof workers, it could be&quot;-confined! to that class.The Minister of Labour and National Service, while inagreement with this general view, thought that there was a case for dealing specially with the dock workers at Liverpool, forexample, half of whom lived close alongside the docks and were thus liable to receive in their homes the full effect of a heavy raidon the dock areas. Rather similar circumstances existed at Hull.He was not urging that these dockers should be provided with

Civil Defence.Debate in theHouse ofCommons.Procedure.Civil defence organisation.Great George Street, S.W. 1,June 5, 1941.temporary living accommodation outsidle the boundaries of the cityor borough, but only that, so far as possible, they should be moved to other accommodation within the city boundaries, further removed from the docks.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved generally the conclusions in the Joint Memo-randum (W.P. (G) (41) 56).(2) Invited the Ministers concerned to consult together as towhether special provision could not be made to findalternative accommodation for dock workers who lived!in areas immediately adjoining the dock areas whichwere liable to specially heavy attack, without prejudicing the conclusions in the Joint Memorandum.10. Several members of the War Cabinet feared lest in the debate on Civil Defence in the House of Commons in the following week, Members of Parliament might unwittingly make statements which would impart information to the enemy. The HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security undertook to send thePrime Minister a list of such points.The Prime Minister said that, at the beginning of the Debate,he would move the House into Secret Session for a short period,and detail to the House certain matters which, in the public interest,must not be referred to in open discussion.The War Cabinet approved this suggestion.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatcertain points in regard to Civil Defence organisations were likelyto be raised in the Debate.  Thus (1) The Select Committee on National Expenditure, in their14th Report, had recommended that further considera-tion should be given to the concentration of all civil defence functions in a single Ministry. Since12 Departments of State were concerned in civil defence matters, this was clearly impracticable.(2) Another proposal, to which some publicity had been given,was that the control of Local Authorities over civil defence matters should be taken from them and vested in the Regional Commissioners. This would involvecutting in half those Local Authority organisations which had both Civil Defence and peace-time functions.It would also give rise to grave shortage of adminis-trative personnel. On the whole, the Local authorities had done Civil Defence work well, and arrangements could be made to provide stiffening or special assistancewhere necessary.The Prime Minister, while he was in general agreement withthe line which the Home Secretary proposed to take in debate,thought that it would be better not to close the door to possiblechanges in organisation in the future. The line taken might be toindicate that the changes proposed would involve violent readjust-ments of the existing machine, and it seemed very doubtful whatbenefit would be derived from them; but that the Government were at all times prepared to consider such readjustments in organisation as experience might suggest.The War Cabinet Agreed that the Home Secretary and Minister of home security should deal with the matter on these lines.
