Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference :W.M. (41) 31stConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.TheMediterranean.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.1. The Chiefs of Stuff made the following reports in ampli-fication of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 569-571 : Aircraft losses in the home theatre since the 24th March hadbeen : Enemy 3 destroyed.5 damaged.Our Own 3 Coastal Command aircraft destroyed.In overseas theatres, the losses had been: Enemy 6 destroyed.3 probable.4 damaged.Our Own 2 destroyed (but no pilots lost).H.M.S. York had been attacked by six &quot; one-man &quot; submarines in Suda Bay on the 26th March and had been torpedoed and subse-quently beached, with both boiler and engine rooms flooded. Onesubmarine had been recovered intact, two had been blown up and six prisoners had been captured. The oiler Peracles had also been torpedoed and beached.There were indications of enemy activity in the eastern mediterranean.Fewer U-boats were operating in the North-western approaches. During the preceding three days we had lost about ,500 tons of merchant shipping. The Britannia accounted for,800 tons of this total. In addition, tonnage totalling about30,000 tons had been damaged.On the 24th March the enemy, employing M. 13 Tanks, had occupied Fort Agheila, which had not been in occupation by us.By the evening they had advanced eighteen miles further east, andhad turned south-west.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Balkans.Yugoslavia.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 31stConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The War Cabinet were informed that a military coupd&apos;Etat had taken place in Yugoslavia in the small hours of that morning. The President of the Council and a number of other ministers, including the Minister of War, had been placed underarrest. King Peter had issued a proclamation to the effect that hehad taken the Royal authority into his hands, and had entrustedthe Government to General Simovitch. The repudiation of theGovernment which had signed the Three-Power Pact was a clearrebuff to our enemies.The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that he had taken the following action : (1) He had asked the Foreign Secretary and the Chief of theImperial General Staff to return at once to Cairo to concert events.   [Telegram No. 93 to Mr. Eden.](2) He had authorised the British Minister in Belgrade toinform the new Government that, on the basis that theywere determined to denounce the Pact with Germany,and to help in the defence of Greece, we recognised them as the Government of Yugoslavia. [Telegram No. 402to Belgrade.][22360]b 2
(3) He had sent a message to the Turkish President that the yugoslav development appeared to offer the best oppor-tunity of preventing German domination of the Balkans.[Telegram No. 684 to Angora.](4) He had also telegraphed to President Roosevelt informing him of the measures which we were taking to meet thenew situation, and urging him to encourage those elements in the Balkans which were determined to resist German penetration. [Telegram No. 1678 to washington. ](5) He had given instructions to the Chief of the Air Staff tobring to a higher strength the Royal Air Force bomber squadrons in Greece.(6) The Royal Air Force had been instructed what action theyshould take in the event of the enemy deliberatelybombing Athens.If the Germans invaded Greece, our air squadrons in Greece would at once attack suitable air targets.If  later  information  continued  favourable,   he proposed to advise His Majesty to send a personal message to King Peter.The War Cabinet took note with approval of the measures taken by the Prime Minister.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 31stConclusions,Minute 4.)Publication of casulties.(previous references:W.M. (40) 207thConclusions,Minute 8; andW.M. (40) 290thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat enemy activity had been on a small scale, both by day and by night, in the last few days. Enemy bombs had been dropped on theprevious day at Yeovil, Gloucester and Overton. Northolt Aero-drome had been machine-gunned.In the first report of the raids on Clydeside on the 13th/14thand 14th/15th March it had been stated that the casualties had been small in relation to the severity of the attack. This statement,which was inaccurate, had given rise to some feeling among thepeople on Clydeside, and in consequence it had been found necessaryto depart from the normal rule whereby figures of casualties inparticular raids were not published, and an announcement had beenmade that the figure of killed was 500. The latest informationshowed that the number killed was about 1,040. Mr. McGovern,M.P., had put down a Question in regard to the number of casual-ties, and there was considerable pressure in favour of publicationof a revised figure, in order to satisfy public opinion of the reliability of official figures.In discussion, it was suggested that this showed the desirabilityof adhering as closely as possible to the rule of not publishing figuresof casualties in particular raids.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Home Security to consider further,in consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland,whether an announcement should be made giving revisedfigures of casualties in the Clydeside raids;(2) Expressed the view that it would in any case be desirableto defer making any such announcement until thefollowing Tuesday.
United States ofAmerica.Leases of bases in british territory.4. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that theColonial Secretary, the Dominions Secretary and he had signed theAgreement in regard to the United States Bases that afternoon.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Blockade.unoccupied france andFrench north africa.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 30thConclusions,Minute 3.)A&quot;5. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theMinister for Economic Warfare, W.P. (41) 67, and the Minister ofShipping, W.P. (41) 70, regarding the blockade of unoccupied france and French North Africa.The Minister for Economic Warfare said that the trade betweenthe North African ports and Marseilles made a serious breach inour blockade of Germany. Enough ground nuts had passed through to provide Germany and Austria with their margarine ration for six months. Pressure should be brought to bear upon the UnitedStates Administration to make them more blockade-minded. Thelarge-scale barter agreement with Germany recently made by admiral Darlan had had, from our point of view, a good effect on united States opinion.The Minister of Shipping favoured maintenance of the blockade of Unoccupied France and French North Africa in order to induce the French to release the 250,000 tons of British and Allied shippingwhich they were detaining illegally in Unoccupied French ports,mainly in North Africa. In the last five months we had obtained a most useful reinforcement of our tonnage through the interception of some 100,000 tons of French shipping.The First Lord of the A dmiralty thought the instructions issuedby the Admiralty, as a result of the War Cabinet decision on the20th March, that food ships were not to be detained needed to be clarified. A further instruction should be sent that all ships with-out navicerts should be arrested, and their cargoes reported home.He agreed with the suggestions made in telegram No. 1628 to lord halifax, and also with the proposals made by the Minister for economic Warfare in his Memorandum, of which (c) would be met by the amended instructions which he suggested should be sent toHis Majesty&apos;s ships. But the strain on our naval resources was atthe moment very great, and these must limit severely the number ofships intercepted.The Prime Minister said that our policy had been to maintainthe blockade against the French, but not to a point which mightsting them to violent action. There had been a movement in theUnited States in favour of victualling Unoccupied France; and wehad suggested to President Roosevelt that he might make a workingagreement for us with the French. So far, however, nothing hadtranspired. The reaction of the United States to the. agreement made with the Germans by Admiral Darlan made it a good moment to enquire how these negotiations were progressing. The situation was a serious one, for the French were importing some 1\ million tons from North Africa and If million tons from West Africa.More than half of these cargoes found their way to Germany andthis quantity of imports might be greatly increased. There was some reason to suppose that the French were negotiating to importcargoes from South America. If the public in this country feltthat we were not taking a strong line in this matter, there would bea good deal of bitter feeling. If we allowed food into Unoccupied!Franee, we might be asked to relax the blockade of enemy occupied countries.
The War Cabinet-(1) Gave general approval to the policy summarised in para-graph 9 (a) to (e) of the Minister for Economic Warfare&apos;s paper, in the light of the discussion which had takenplace.(2) Agreed that the first step would be for the Prime Ministerto communicate with President Roosevelt, asking what progress had been made with the negotiations which hehad been asked to undertake, and informing him at thesame time of the action which we proposed to pursue.(3) Invited the Foreign Office and the Ministry of economic warfare, in consultation, to submit to the PrimeMinister material to form the basis for this communi-cation and for a telegram to Lord Halifax.(4) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to despatch revisedinstructions on the lines indicated at &quot; A &quot; above.Holidays.Civil ServiceLeave.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 220thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Note setting out proposals which had been made for the grant of leave this year tothe Civil Service (W.P. (G) (41) 35).The War Cabinefs decision was as follows : (1) The importance of holidays for maintaining efficiency was recognised.(2) Heads of Departments should encourage their officers totake a week&apos;s holiday. They should have discretion,when they think the circumstances justify it, to grantup to another week.(3) No public announcement should be made on this matter.Great George Street, S.W. 1,March 27, 1941.
