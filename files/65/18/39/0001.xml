Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 59thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.Western Desert.Syria.Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff made the following reports in amplification-cation of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 649-652 : Summary of aircraft losses since the 12th June : Home Theatre Enemy 17 destroyed.2 probable.7 damaged.Overseas Theatre Enemy 32 destroyed.3 probable.16 damaged.Our Own 1 fighter.11 bombers.8 Coastal Command.Our Own 16 destroyed.4 damaged.In answer to the Prime Minister, the Chief of the Air staff said that the Air Staff had considered what measures would haveto be taken to enable us to organise daylight air attacks into the heart of Germany as our air strength increased.During the previous four days we had lost 8 ships, totalling38,000 tons, 5 by submarine, 1 by mine and 2 by aircraft. Merchantshipping totalling 8,000 tons had been damaged.Another German supply ship had been captured off theEquator, making a total of 6 or 7 of such vessels captured or sunk.The Germans claimed to have sunk 21,000 tons of our shipping in a Gibraltar convoy. We had, in fact, lost no ships in this convoy,and it seemed probable that the 3 German and 1 Italian aircraft which were reported to have crashed in Portugal had done so as aresult of damage received from the Catalina aircraft protecting thisconvoy.Two Destroyers had been damaged by air attack off the Syriancoast.Our attack in the Western Desert had begun in the early hoursof the 15th June. Particulars were given of the progress so farmade. The enemy was surrounded at Halfaya, but still resisting.Fort Capuzzo and Bir Waer were in our hands, but the enemy was still in strength at Bir Hafid. There was no reason to be dissatisfied with the progress made, although we had had a number of tanks putout of action by mines.The Chief of the Air Staff said that Air Marshal Tedder hadbeen asked to supply fuller information regarding the air operations in connection with this battle.A message had been received from General. Catroux that anumber of Messerschmitts and Junkers had been seen in Syria. he also mentioned that an order had been found on a Vichy Frenchprisoner ordering them to fire on any parley party.The German concentration against Russia was proceeding andshould be by now nearly complete.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.ofwithTurkey.ConclusionAgreementGermany.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 56thConclusions,Minute 2.) ,2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theWar Cabinet would have seen in the telegrams that Turkey seemedto be on the point of concluding an agreement with Germany. Thiswas unfortunate, more especially as Turkey was not under suchstrong pressure from Germany as had been the case two months ago.While the conclusion of the agreement, coming at the present justice, was unprOpitious, its terms might have been much worse.There would be a saving clause to the effect that the agreement was without, prejudice to previous engagements entered into by either side. There was nothing we could do to prevent Turkey signing theagreement.[22621]b 2
The Prime Minister said that the central fact was that Turkey-still remained a neutral. It was important that the Press should notheap abuse on Turkey when the signature of the agreement became known.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement and invited the Minister ofInformation, after consultation with the Foreign Secre-tary, to give guidance to the Press as to the attitude to beadopted to the signature of this agreement.U.S.S.R. 3.   The War Cabinet were given further information as to the(Previous relations between Germany and the U.S.S.E.   This is recorded in reference:       the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.W.M. (41) 59thConclusions,Minute 2.)Shipping. 4.   The War Cabinet were informed that under presentPublication of arrangements the shipping losses for the month of May were due to shipping Losses. De published on the following day. The losses for May as at present(Previous known amounted to 461,000 tons. This figure included 54,000 tonsReference: in the Mediterranean, 155,000 tons in the North Atlantic,W.M. (41) 53rd 186,000 tons in the Freetown area, and 61,000 tons in united conclusions, Kingdom and coastal waters (this last figure included losses in portsMinute 4.)&apos; in the United Kingdom). The losses in April, as published, hadbeen 488,000 tons. To this figure must be added losses of 93,000(largely in the Mediterranean) subsequently reported.The Prime Minister emphasised the seriousness of these losses.He thought that their publication might have a discouraging effecton.public opinion in this country. From the point of view of publicopinion in the United States, publication might well have a beneficial effect. On the other hand, if we were to cease publicationat this moment, this in itself would be somewhat of a shock to publicopinion in the United States and might secure for us as much thesame result.The issue was evenly balanced, but, on the whole, the PrimeMinister thought that it was important that we should not get intoa position in which we were under an obligation to publish figures at regular monthly intervals.The First Sea Lord gave the War Cabinet information as to thethree main areas in which enemy submarines were operating andthe steps which we had taken to meet these threats.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that publication of our losses would give the Germans accurate information, which theycould not otherwise obtain, as to the effect of the changes in german submarine strategy changes which were forced upon them as ourcounter-measures became effective.The Prime Minister thought that this was a very strong arguement against publication. On the other hand, there was reasonto hope that the June shipping losses would be less serious. there might thus be some advantage in publishing the monthly figures forMay and June and ceasing to publish monthly figures thereafter.The Minister of War Transport said that it was -becoming increasingly difficult to find British crews for the hew ships as theywere completed, and for foreign ships which we were taking overon a bare-boat basis. He thought that continued publication of our losses would add to these difficulties.
In discussion, it was generally felt that the most important consideration was the effect on American public opinion, and that adecision should be postponed until United States reactions had beenobtained.Attention was drawn to the fact that a leaflet about our shipping losses, dropped by the Germans in a remote rural district,had been published in one of the daily papers. This, it was felt, was unfortunate.The War Cabinet-(1) Decided that shipping losses for the month of May shouldnot be published on the following day. The Press shouldbe told that, as a certain number of losses continued tobe received late in the month, publication of the Maylosses could not be made on the date anticipated, but must be postponed.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to send a personal telegram toMr. Hopkins, for communication to the President of theUnited States, on the question of publication of shipping losses, putting to him the arguments made in discussion.The Minister of State was also invited to make certainpersonal enquiries in regard to opinion in the UnitedStates, on the lines indicated by him.(3) Postponed for a week, pending the result of these enquiries,a decision whether shipping losses should continue to bepublished monthly.(4) Agreed that the Minister of Information might departfrom the normal practice whereby the loss of individualships was not published, and announce the loss of a passanger vessel on the Fishguard-Bosslare route.Shipping.forthcoming debate in theHouse ofCommons.5. The Prime Minister said that in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons on shipping matters he proposed to move the House into Secret Session and to make a full statement of thevarious measures which had been put in hand in connection with the battle of the Atlantic. The House should know how seriousthe position was and what had already been done to meet it. Itwould be for consideration whether this speech should be made atthe beginning of the Debate or in reply to it.The War Cabinet took note with approval of this statement.Great George Street, S.W. 1,June 16, 1941.
