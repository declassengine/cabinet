In Eritreaour troops were close to Massawa. Our forces, which had capturedAddis Ababa on the 5th April, had sent out detachments to theNorth, South and West, this last being the direction in which the duke of Aosta was believed to have withdrawn.There was very little news from Yugoslavia. German forcesmoving from Bulgaria had advanced some way towards Skoplje andStip on the previous day against slight resistance.On the Rupel Pass the Greeks claimed to have inflicted a bloodyrepulse on the Germans.A discussion on the situation in Libya and the Balkans is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Reference was made to recent communiques on the Libyansituation issued from Cairo which had been too encouraging in tone.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to ask General Wavellto telegraph his communiques in draft to London for issue here.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.2 &apos; The First Sea Lord gave the following summary of shippingSMPptog,T        casualties since the last Meeting of the War Cabinet :-ShippmgLosses.

The War Cabinet were given the following information : Our Minister at Budapest had been told to ask for passportsand to leave as soon as possible. The Hungarian Minister inLondon had been informed accordingly, and had been told that weshould give him all possible facilities for leaving this country.The Prime Minister&apos;s message to our new Allies had been handed to the Yugoslav Minister, and had been well received byhim. The Yugoslav Government had left Belgrade, and our minister had followed the same course.The Soviet-Yugoslav Pact of Friendship and Non-Aggressionwas a favourable development. Clearly the Soviet would be ingreat peril if Hitler were to succeed in his hopes of rapid success in the Balkans.Turkey&apos;s attitude was unchanged. The Turkish Governmentargued that, so long as Turkey remained intact, they protected ourflank and thereby served our interests.The position had deteriorated, and it looked as though a showof force, at any rate, might be necessary before the position couldbe redressed.   In discussion, the importance of Basra was stressed.The War Cabinet were informed that General Wavell had been consulted on the military implications of the position, which were also under consideration by the Chiefs of Staff.It had now been arranged that the Prime Minister&apos;s message to Mr. Matsuoka should be given to him in Moscow by Sir stafford cripps.The War Cabinet took note of this information.Great George Street, S.
