(41) 32ndConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.TheMediterranean.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.Eritrea and abyssinia.1. The Chiefs of Staff made the following reports in ampli-fieation of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 572-575 : On the previous night 94 of our bombers had attacked theenemy cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at Brest. A number of bombs had straddled the ships, but as armour-piercing bombs hadbeen used it was difficult to say what damage had been inflicted.Aircraft losses in the home theatre since the 27th March hadbeen: Enemy 3 destroyed.1 probable.2 damaged.Our own   -1 fighter destroyed.6 bomber and coastal command aircraft destroyed.In overseas theatres the losses had been : Enemy 5 destroyed.5 probable.21 damaged.Our own 7 destroyed.That day Blenheims had sunk two tankers off the coast ofNormandy. Off the Dutch coast our aircraft had hit a destroyerand a merchant vessel, and had successfully machine-gunned aGerman battalion on parade. Two Blenheims had been lost during these two operations.The First Sea Lord gave an account of the naval action againstItalian forces which had taken place on the 28th/29th March inthe Eastern Mediterranean, and which had resulted in the sinking,so far as was known at present, of three enemy 8-inch gun cruisers and two destroyers. An Italian battleship of the Littorio Class hadbeen hit by at least three torpedoes, but it was uncertain whethershe had sunk. Our losses had been two aircraft missing. FiftyItalian Officers and 850 men had been saved from the sunken ships,but rescue operations had had to be abandoned owing to attacks by german aircraft.The Prime Minister said that, anticipating the wishes of theCabinet, he had telegraphed his congratulations to Sir andrew cunningham and Sir Arthur Longmore on this fortunate and timelyaction.During the previous four days 34,500 tons of shipping had been sunk and 22,000 damaged.The cruiser Bonaventure had been torpedoed and sunk by a submarine 90 miles south of Crete when escorting a convoy. TenOfficers (including the Captain) and 310 men had been saved. TheAustralian destroyer Stuart had attacked and probably destroyed the submarine making the attack.The War Cabinet agreed that for the present no public announcement should be made regarding the loss of the Bonaventure.The First Lord of -the Admiralty was invited to consider thepossibility of transporting Italian prisoners of war in shipsreturning from Greece to Alexandria.Our troops were now over half-way from Keren on the Asmararoad. Diredawa had been occupied by troops of the South AfricanDivision, which had then turned westwards.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.[22374]b 2
Blockade. 2. The First Sea Lord reported that on the previous morningInterception of Sheffield and four destroyers had endeavoured to intercept an east-escorted French bound convoy of four French merchant vessels escorted by a destroyerConvoys. off Nemours, Algeria. The convoy had refused to stop and had(Previous entered Nemours, where a 6-inch shore battery had opened fire on reference.- our ships. Sheffield had replied and the battery had been hit&apos;.W.M. (41) 30th Sheffield and the destroyers had been bombed as they withdrew.Conclusions, This convoy included the Bangkok, which, we now knew, had off-Minute 3.) loaded her rubber cargo at Casablanca.The Prime Minister said that the Captain of the Sheffield had sent a signal saying that he could only have prevented the convoy from escaping by opening fire on the destroyer and the ships in the convoy; and that such action would have been contrary to Inter-national Law, and would have had bad political effects. In fact,however, such action would have been in harmony with InternationalLaw.The First Lord of the A dmiralty gave details of the instructionsregarding the interception of merchant vessels laid down in thePrize Manual. These provided for firing two blank rounds; thenfor a shot across the bows. If this was disregarded, force could beused. The incident was being enquired into and, in the light of this experience, further instructions would be issued regarding the interception of convoys either east or west of Gibraltar.The Prime Minister said that it might not be convenient forus to make a further interception in the near future. But it wasvitally necessary not to allow a complete breach to be made in our blockade. He invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to arrangefor plans to be prepared for a further interception, when forces were available, and to ensure that the instructions to be followedon this occasion as to the force to be used were quite definite.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.United States of       3.   The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet of messagesAmerica. which he had exchanged with President Roosevelt.    He hadSupply of informed the President of the action in the Eastern Mediterranean,Munitions &amp;c. and had thanked him for placing 10 Revenue Cutters at our(Previous disposal for convoy duties.   He had also received a personalReference: telegram&apos;from the President giving details of allotments madeW.M. (41) 10th under the Lease and Lend Act, appropriating funds for theConclusions, purchase for this country of aircraft, Oerlikon guns, and substantialMinute 4.) &apos; quantities of other munitions.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Italian Bast 4.   The Prime Minister said that it had seemed to himAfrica. necessary to take steps to prevent the Italians scuttling theShips at 25 merchant ships reported to be in Massawa Harbour.   He hadMassawa. telegraphed to the Foreign Secretary suggesting that he should send a message to the Duke of Aosta to the effect that, if these ships were scuttled, we should consider ourselves free from any obligationto feed the Italians in Eritrea or Abyssinia or to remove them fromthose countries (telegram No. 649 to Athens).The War Cabinet took note with approval of the action taken.
Japan.proposed meeting betweenJapaneseForeignMinister andJapaneseAmbassador inLondon.6. The Prime Minister said that Mr. Matsuoka had sent a message asking Mr. Shigemitsu to meet him in France. On thewhole he thought that the fact that Mr. Shigemitsu was friendly tous and would testify to the strength and unity of this country out-weighed the arguments in favour of preventing him from makingthe journey.He proposed to see Mr. Shigemitsu before he started, and he wished to give Mr. Shigemitsu a sealed letter to be delivered toMr. Matsuoka. His letter, which would be very frank, would setout a number of questions which the Japanese Government shouldanswer, before embarking on war against us.The War Cabinet-(i) agreed that Mr. Shigemitsu should be allowed to leave thiscountry for the purpose of visiting Mr. Matsuoka.(ii) approved the text of the Prime Minister&apos;s letter toMr. Matsuoka subject to an omission in the first para-graph.Soviet Union.The baltic states.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 290thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Lord Privy Seal referred to Moscow telegram No. 286,in which Sir Stafford Cripps suggested that we should reopengeneral political discussions with the Soviet Government, who mightshortly be subjected to great pressure from Germany. As a pre-liminary it was essential to get the Baltic States question out of theway.   What concessions were we prepared to make?The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for foreign ffairs said that the Foreign Secretary was continuing to deal with questions affecting our relations with Russia. Generally speaking,we would be ill-advised to modify the rigour of our blockade, or theline we had taken about the Baltic States, except in return forThe Balkans. 5.   The War Cabinet again discussed the situation in theYugoslavia.       Balkans and the results of the coup d&apos;Etat in Yugoslavia.(Previous In a general review the Prime Minister expressed admirationReference: for the Foreign Secretary&apos;s vigorous handling of the situation andW.M. (41) 32nd drew attention to the following: Conclusions, (i) Turkey&apos;s short-sighted policy had placed her in a pre-Minute 2.) carious position.   The Foreign Secretary had instructedSir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen to warn Turkey of thedanger of continuing to stand aloof,(ii) Our Minister in Belgrade had objected strongly to theB.B.C.&apos;s comments on the coup d&apos;E,tat in Yugoslavia.These objections had, the Prime Minister thought, beenoverstressed. But he asked the Minister of information to pay close attention to the matter.(iii) The Greek Government were offering . Prince Paul anasylum in Greece. There seemed to be no objection tothis.(iv) With the approval of Mr. Menzies, he had telegraphed^tothe Australian Cabinet, pointing out how greatly events had moved in our favour since the decision to sendBritish Imperial troops to Greece. Enough had alreadyhappened to remove any doubts about the Tightness ofour decision.The War Cabinet took note with approval of the measures taken by the Prime Minister.
some important concession from Russia, e.g., her return to an attitude of genuine neutrality. The Foreign Office were preparing a plan of action which could be put into effect quickly should there be a marked improvement in the Soviet attitude.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Import andServiceProgrammes.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 285thConclusions,Minute 13.)naval construction programme.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 277thConclusions,Minute 3.)Army.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 21stConclusions,Minute 6.1Food.Refrigeratedtonnage.Admixture ofpotato flour inbread.8. The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by thePrime Minister (W.P. (41) 68 and 69). These two Papers dealt withthe Import Programme for the year 1941. Attached to the secondMemorandum were two Directives dealing with Army Scales andthe 1941 Naval Programme.Points raised in discussion : (i) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the admiralty were anxious to proceed with the Aircraft-carrierincluded in the 1940 Supplementary Programme. they hoped that it would be possible to make the necessary adjustments in the armour-plate figures set out in para-graph 5 of Annex II.(ii) The Admiralty thought that they could provide forprogress with the Vanguard within the same limits ofarmour-plate provision.(iii) It was doubtful whether the three Light Cruisers of the1941 Programme could be completed by the end of 1942.(iv) The Secretary of State for War said that he agreed withthe Prime Minister&apos;s directive and would proceed tomake the necessary adjustments in the Programme.(v) The Prime Minister urged the Service Ministers to do allin their power to curb the growth of establishments. Areduction of 50,000 should be aimed at in the Royal AirForce establishment. The Secretary of State for Airsaid the great difficulty in obtaining the type of man-power required was in itself a powerful incentive toeconomy.(vi) The Minister of Food said that the revised programme(which would give him 14 million tons in the second year of war) gave him the prospect of providing the peopleof this country with an adequate and sufficiently varieddiet.The Prime Minister said that it was essential to import sufficient to maintain the staying-power of thepeople, even if this meant a somewhat slower develop-ment of our Service programmes. Nothing must inter-fere with the supplies necessary to maintain the staminaand resolution of the people of this country.(vii) The Minister of Food said that the supply of meatdepended mainly on sufficient refrigerated tonnage being-available. The Prime Minister said that he had appointed a Committee to investigate this matter. TheUnited States authorities should be asked whether theycould fit up ships as troop-carriers and thus release someof our refrigerated space for carrying meat.(viii) Reference was made to the admixture of potato flour inbread. The Minister of Food was invited to considerwhether some admixture should not be made withoutany prior announcement. The saving in tonnage couldbe used for importing tea and sugar.
(ix) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that the revised allocation would mean that our dairy and beefherds would be maintained at the level to which theywould be reduced by the autumn. The animalsslaughtered to effect the reduction contemplated wouldbe used to maintain the meat ration at its present levelover the coming six months.(x) The Minister of Aircraft Production urged that further steps should be taken to increase the home production offood.(xi) The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australiasaid that the need to concentrate on shorter hauls woulddrastically affect Australia^ spending power. He had had some discussion over the week-end with Mr. Harri-man, who thought that there were various ways in whichthe United States could provide considerable help onthis matter. It was agreed that this point should befurther examined.(xii) The President of the Board of Trade said that, with theexception of tobacco, most of the items in the Board ofTrade import programme were concerned with muni-tions. Leather, cotton, wool and rayon for civilian usecame under the Ministry of Supply programme. Theamounts of these raw materials allotted for civilian consumption had already been reduced to the bareminimum and were not susceptible of further cuts.(xiii) The Minister of Supply said that he was hoping to getsome relief on raw materials for clothing as the resultof the decisions on Army Scales. He hoped that it wouldnot be necessary to reduce the quantity of these articlesrequired for civilian consumption. In any case theprogramme would be kept under review by the ImportExecutive.(xiv) The Minister of Supply emphasised that the reductionproposed in the Ministry of Supply programme couldonly be effected by cutting into stocks. He hoped thatthis aspect of the matter would be borne in mind.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) The Memoranda by the Prime Minister on the import programme, together with the directives on Army Scalesand the 1941 Naval Programme (W.P. (41) 68 and 69),were approved.(2) The Import Programmes and the stock position should be carefully watched and brought under review by theappropriate bodies quarterly, or oftener should thesituation render this necessary.(3) A number of matters were noted for further examination (a) Special meetings of the Ministerial Committee on export Surpluses should be convened, which mr. Menzies and Mr. Harriman should be invitedto attend, in regard to the effect of the revisedimport programmes on Australia&apos;s exports.(b) The Minister of Shipping should investigate whathelp could be obtained from the United States inthe release of refrigerated tonnage from Serviceuser.(c) The Minister of Food was invited to considermeasures to save wheat imports by mixing a small proportion of potato flour in bread.id) The Service Ministers were invited to pay particular attention to measures to curb the growth of establishments.(4) Note was taken of the points raised by the First Lord of theAdmiralty in regard to the Navy programme.
Auxiliary 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theTerritorial        Secretary of State for War (W.P. (41) 72).Service. The Memorandum foreshadowed a considerable increase in theStatus and numbers to be employed in order to economise man-power. It wasFuture proposed to employ women on certain operational duties, particu-Employment.    larly in connection with A.D.G.B.; and to give a fuller militarystatus to the women&apos;s corps by means of a Defence Regulation.Consideration would be given to tightening up the conditions ofservice so that members of the corps would no longer be able to terminate their services practically at will.The Secretary of State for Air supported these proposals, andwas anxious to adopt similar measures for the W.A.A.F.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Board ofAdmiralty rather doubted the need for the changes proposed, so faras concerned the W.R.N.S.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that fuller military status should begiven to the A.T.S. and that they should be employed onoperational roles of the kind mentioned in the Secretaryof State for War&apos;s Memorandum.(2) Agreed that the same principle might be applied to theW.R.N.S. and to the W.A.A.F. if this course was desired by the Board of Admiralty or by the Air Council.(3) Invited the three Service Ministers to arrange for the consequential measures involved to be worked out in collaboration between the three Service Departments.Entertainments. 10. The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet that, atSunday Opening a Meeting of Ministers held on Wednesday, the 26th March, it had of Theatres and been decided that the prayer against the Defence Regulation toMusic Halls. enable theatres and music halls to be open on Sunday should be left(Previous to a free vote of the House, it being understood that no MinisterEeference: or junior Minister should vote against the Regulation, althoughW.M. (41) 15th one or two Ministers might be absent from the House on otherConclusions,      business.Minute 7.) The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a letter which hehad received urging that Ministers as well as private members should be allowed to exercise their freedom of conscience and voteas they pleased.In discussion it was urged (1) That, as the Regulation had already been made, it wouldbe very difficult to justify a member of the Governmentvoting against a decision of the Government.(2) That, on constitutional grounds, it was objectionable that ministers should vote against a decision of the Govern-ment which bore on the prosecution of the war.(3) That to allow Ministers to vote against the Governmentput the Minister in charge of the debate in an unfairposition.The War Cabinet-Adhered to their decision that no Minister or juniorMinister should vote for the prayer against the Regula-tion, although they might abstain from voting.The Secretary was instructed to convey this decision to all ministers, and to ask them to communicate it to junior-Ministers in their Departments.Great George Street, S. W. 1,March 31, 1941.

CYPHER TELEGRAM

TO THE UNITED KINGDOM HIGH COMMISSIONER IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA. (Sent 02.50 hrs., 30th March, 1941)



IMMEDIATE

No. 162 MOST SECRET.



Please give following message from Mr. Churchill to Acting Prime Minister for his most secret and personal information. Begins:-



When a month ago we decided upon LUSTRE it looked a rather bleak military adventure dictated by noblesse oblige. Thursday&apos;s events in Belgrade show far-reaching effects of this and other measures we have taken on whole Balkan situation. German plans have been upset and we may cherish renewed hopes of forming a Balkan front with Turkey comprising about 70 Allied divisions from the four powers concerned.This is of course by no means certain yet. But even now it puts LUSTRE in its true setting, not as an isolated military act, but as a prime mover in large design. Whatever outcome may be, everything that has happened since LUSTRE decision taken justifies it. Delay also will enable full concentration to be made on Greek front instead of piecemeal engagement of our forces. Result unknowable but prize has increased and risks have somewhat lessoned. Am in closest touch with Menzies. Wish I could talk it over with you. Ends.
