The Chiefs of Staff made the following reports in ampli-fication of the information contained in Cabinet War Room Records544-547 :-On the previous night 40 aircraft had attacked the HipperClass cruiser at Brest. Six pilots claimed to have put their bombsinto the dock.Two enemy aircraft had been destroyed that afternoon in thesouth-west approaches.A Blenheim aircraft claimed to have sunk an enemy submarinein the Red Sea on the 1st March.The loss of bombers .on the previous night had been due to a sudden deterioration in weather conditions.The shipping losses during the last four days totalled 52,000&apos;tons, while 78,000 tons of shipping had been damaged.Particulars were given of the increased armaments now being supplied for our merchant ships.The First Sea Lord gave the Cabinet such particulars as wereavailable of the landing of British Forces in Kasteloritzo on the25th February and their subsequent withdrawal on the night the27th/28th February. All the arrangements for this operation hadbeen made by the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, and the sequence of events was far from clear.  A full report was awaited.There was nothing special to report on the military situation.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.foreign information.Turkey.(Previous     iReference:W.M. (41) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)Bulgaria.French north africa.2. The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs read to the War Cabinet a telegram from the foreign secretary at Ankara, dated the 28th February (No. 414), reportingan interview which he and the Chief of the Imperial General staff had had with the President of the Council, the Turkish Ministerfor Foreign Affairs and Marshal Cakmak.Our Minister at Sofia had been authorised to break off diplo-matic relations and to leave Bulgaria as soon as he considered thathis position had become impossible.200 more Germans were reported to be expected at Casablanca.With those already arrived, there would then be 350 Germans inthe port.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.TheMediterranean.Proposal that ships should bestink at sight incertain areas.(previous references:W.M. (41) 19thConclusions,Minute 9, andW.M. (41) 13th&apos;Conclusions,Minute 3.)3. The First Lord of the A dmiralty reminded the War Cabinetthat on-the ,5th February a proposal had been approved that enemy vessels South of Latitude 350 46&apos; North should be assumed to beenemy transports and auxiliaries, and sunk at sight. Our sub-marines experienced difficulties in distinguishing at night betweenenemy vessels and others in these waters. He asked authority toissue orders for the sinking of any ship in the dark in this area,and submitted the text of (a) a notification which it was proposedto send to the French government (b) a telegram which he proposedto send to the Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean. **The War Cabinet-        &apos;fApproved the despatch of these communications[22279]b 2

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theForeign Office (W.P. (41) 45). ,The War Cabinet were informed that a telegrani had alreadybeen despatched to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,authorising him to mention this matter if he thought fit to the yugoslav Government.The War Cabinet-Decided that it was not desirable at this stage to make a move in this matter beyond the terms of the telegram inquestion.chemical warfare.Publicity forprecautionarymeasures.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 14thConclusions,Minute 3.)&quot;&apos; A &quot;6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (41) 44). TheMinister reported that a continuation and development of publicitywithin the limits at present agreed was unlikely to produce enougheffect. He recommended an explicit statement of policy on thefollowing lines : (i) We regard the gas weapon with abhorrence and will in no circumstances be the first to make use of it;(ii) We cannot rely upon our enemy&apos;s undertakings not to use it as proof that he will not in fact do so;(iii) If he does, he may count upon powerful and immediateretaliation; but(iv) It behoves us to take full defensive measures for the safety of the civilian population, which must itself co-operateby carrying and practising with its gas masks andobeying other instructions given to it.In discussion of point (iii) of the suggested statement it was urged that the enemy would not hesitate to use gas if they thoughtthat it would be in their interests. We need not, therefore, fear to mention retaliation. On the other hand, the Chiefs of Staff had advised that it would be better to say nothing of retaliation againstGermany unless and until we had evidence that the use of gas byGermany was imminent. It was not clear why a policy of increasedpublicity for anti-gas measures need involve any statement as toretaliation.The Minister of Labour and National Service wanted to seeanti-gas drill made as much a part of our precautions as fire drill.There should be gas mask drill at regular intervals in workshops,offices and schools. The refusal of admission to places of amusementof persons not carrying gas masks should also be considered.The War Cabinet decided as follows : (1) The issue of a Statement of Policy was approved inprinciple, on the lines of (i), (ii) and (iv) quoted above;but for the present no threat of&apos; retaliation should bemade, as suggested in (iii).f C^U1
... 4117 W.M. 22 (41).*(2) The Minister of Home Security was invited to take thefollowing action: (a) To consider, in consultation with the ministers concerned, the suggestions made by the Ministerof Labour and National Service at &quot;A&quot; above which met with general approval.(6) To consider an appeal to Members of both houses of Parliament to set an example by carrying theirgas-masks.(c) To circulate a further Report, in the light of theabove discussion, setting out the practical measures which he proposed to take, to whichmight be appended the text of the draft Statementof policy .Production. 7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the concentration in Lord President of the Council on Concentration of production the Consumers&apos; (W.P. (G) (41) 27). The Paper outlined a scheme whereby theGoods Government should declare, and, if necessary, enforce, a policy ofIndustries. concentrating production in industries which supplied purelycivilian needs, and were covered by the Limitation of SuppliesOrders, or by the rationing of raw materials.The War Cabinet were informed that the policy of concen-trating production in the consumers&apos; goods industries had been fullyapproved in principle by the Lord Presidents Committee. ThePresident of the Board of Trade had been authorised to proceedwith the planning and preliminary discussions required before the \scheme could be publicly launched. It had at first been contemplated that negotiations would be opened with one or two selectedindustries, and that these negotiations would indicate the lines onwhich it would be necessary to proceed generally in giving effect tothe policy of concentration. But the President of the Board ofTrade had to deal with 90 industries, and he would find himself inan impossible position if, before making any preliminary announce-ment of the Government&apos;s policy, he embarked on negotiations(which would certainly become known) with a limited number ofindustries. Further, it was clear that it would not be possible todeal with the great variety of industries concerned on the basis ofany single stereotyped plan. Provisional arrangements had beenmade for the President of the Board of Trade to make a preliminary_      ________announcement of Government policv on the following; dav.      --&apos;:The Minister without Portfolio referred to the statement inparagraph 4 of W.P. (G) (41) 27 that the Government would assistby taking all the measures open to them to help factories closed downto reopen rapidly when circumstances changed. In his viewdeliberate steps were being taken towards the rationalisation ofindustry which it would be difficult to retrace after the war, and he hoped that no undertaking would be given about the reopening of factories which it might be impossible to carry out.The War Cabinet-Approved the scheme for the concentration of industryoutlined in the Lord Presidents Memorandum, subject tothe approval of the Prime Minister.(Note. After the Meeting, the Prime Minister was informed of the discussion which had taken place, and agreed that the scheme should go forward, and thatthe President of the Board of Trade should make hispreliminary announcement on the following day.)Great Georqe Street, S.W.1,March 3, 1941.
