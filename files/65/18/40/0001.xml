MilitaryOperations.Syria.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 60thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. THE War Cabinet were informed that the DefenceCommittee (Operations) had had under consideration that morning the terms on which we should be prepared to agree to the cessation of hostilities in Syria. [See telegram No. 2826&apos;Trom Washington.]Drafts had been prepared of (a) A telegram to Washington,(6) A telegram^to the Commanders-in-Chief in the middle east, commenting on the terms which they had proposed.The War Cabinet- .(1) Approved the immediate despatch of these telegrams,subject to amendment as indicated in discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether it wouldbe desirable that a separate declaration should be issued,reaffirming the statement which we had made at the timewhen our forces had entered Syria, to the effect thatour object was to keep the Axis Powers out of thatcountry, and to secure the liberation of its inhabitantsfrom German and Italian domination.Military 2.   The War Cabinet were given the latest information in operations regard to the operations in the Western Desert.  In the early stages(continued). this operation had developed favourably.    Later the enemy hadWestern Desert, counter-attacked with very large forces, and it had been decided to(Previous break off the operation.  Both sides were now back where they hadBef erence: Started.W.M.

The War Cabinet were informed of certain action whichwas being taken-or was contemplated by the United StatesGovernment. A record is contained in the Secretary&apos;s standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.Shipping. 4.   The Prime Minister said that he had further considered thisPublication of matter since the last meeting. While he still attached importance to shipping Losses, getting free of the obligation to publish these figures at regular(Previous monthly intervals, he thought that there was much to be said for reference:       publishing the figures for May and for June which would probablyW.M. (41) 60th  be a better month and ceasing publication thereafter.   It would conclusions,      be particularly difficult to deny publication of the May losses justMinute 4.)       before the Debate on shipping matters.   Accordingly, he had notsent the proposed personal telegram to Mr. Hopkins.  No indicationshould be given to the Press at this stage of any intention to discontinue publication.   But he proposed, in the Debate on shipping matters in the House of Commons, to inform the house in secret session of the argument put forward by the First Lordagainst monthly publication of these losses, namely, that it gave theenemy accurate information, which they could not otherwise obtain,as to the effect of changes in their submarine strategy.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he was in generalagreement with this view. The shipping losses for June, as so farreported, were 135,000 tons, and he hoped that they would be lower than those for May; but there was reason to believe that a very
large number of enemy submarines were now operating. he proposed that the statement to the Press on the May losses shouldbe on the normal lines. The losses for May would be given(analysed between British, Allied and Neutral) together with the adjustments for the four previous months. This announcement would! be made at about 4 p.m. on the following day.The War Cabinet-Authorised the First Lord of the Admiralty to make anannouncement as to shipping losses on the following dayon the lines indicated by him at &quot;.X.&quot;Shipping. 5.   The War Cabinet agreed with the proposal of the FirstIndependent Lord of the Admiralty that the independent routeing of shipsrouteing and having a speed of over 12 and under 15 knots should cease, and thatConvoys. ships of this speed should sail in convoy.France.Measuresconcerningmerchantshipping in theevent of war orgeneralhostilities with vichy.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 57thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (41) 132) dealing with twospecial problems concerning the control of merchant shipping whichwould arise in the event of war or general hostilities with VichyFrance.   These were : (i) Action regarding French Indo-China.(ii) Action regarding Free French ships and ships manned by Free French crews.The War Cabinet Authorised the First Lord of the Admiralty to despatchthe signals attached to W.P. (41) 132.U.S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 60thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The War Cabinet were informed that there was no changein the position between Russia and! Germany. The question was raised what line should be taken in regard to publicity if war broke out between Germany and Russia.The Prime Minister said that Germany should be represented as an insatiable tyrant, that had attacked Russia in order to obtainmaterial for carrying on the war.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Great George Street, S.

Syrian authorities were therefore very anxious to know in some detail what HisMajestyfs Government and de Gaullists proposed to do asregards1^   the French army of the Levant2)   French Civil Servants in Syria and the Lebanon.3)-   all other French nationals and their families inthose [? grp. omitted:    territories]Although Conty did not say so, he implied that hewas speaking on behalf of the French High Commissioner;   he also..implied, that the question was very urgent and that itshould be dealt with with great discretion since theFrench authorities did not wish to give the impression thatthey were suing for peace.United States Consul-General replied that while he couldnot on his own initiative forward these enquiries direct tothe British authorities in the Near East, he would be glad to telegraph to Washington with request that the matter bebrought to the attention of the British Government.     Contyagreed to this procedure, provided that United States Consul-General could be authorized to exercise his good offices withoutfurther instructions in the event of the French deciding to ask him to do so. &quot;United States
United States Consul-General commented that he thought itsignificant that Conty never once, referred to Vichy Governmentand that he apparently did not have in mind an armisticeor negotiations of a. purely military character.     On. thecontrary, Conty-said that the French authorities were anxiousto know what   political arrangements&apos; could be made with theBritish and Free French authorities.-- - - * - - -&quot;.....-----United States Consul-General-1 s impression is that French are tired and&quot; that they have not received reinforcements&apos; from france.

State Department at the same time conveyed message fromMr. Welles.a&apos;)   That in view of the speed with which things mightmove United States Government hoped that His Majesty&apos;s government might be able to. give a reply by tomorroyf morning June&quot; 19th and b)     that his feeling was that the occasion.was one on whicha handsome and &quot;chevaleresque&quot; response from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might bring great profits.4.     The State Department official felt certain thatif His Majesty&apos;s Government wished the United States Consul-General Beirut to negotiate, the United States Governmentwould be ready to give him the free hand apparently desired by the French High Commissioner Syria,[Being repeated to Cairo No: 2134 for Commanders in Chief],
