Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 29thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.MilitaryOperations.\1. The following reports were made in amplification ofCabinet War Room Records Nos. 562-564 : Aircraft losses over this country since the 17th March hadbeen : Enemy By day 4 destroyed.1 damaged.By night 4 destroyed.1 probable.Ourselves By day 3 destroyed.2 damaged.By night None.One aircraft was missing as the result of our night sorties over germany and three had crashed on landing.The raid on London the previous night had been heavy.220 enemy aircraft had taken part; and at one time 50 (the highestat any time in the war) had been over the inner artillery zone.We were still suffering heavy losses in merchant tonnage from u-boat and aircraft attacks.The Prime Minister said that it was important to make full use of the ex-United States Destroyers. Only about 25 out of the 50were yet at work.Among the prisoners taken from the U-boats we had destroyedwas Captain Kretschmer, reputed to be Germany&apos;s second U-boatace.The 4th Indian Division had now captured the heights fourmiles West of Keren on the Keren-Agordat road. The 5th indian division had now advanced to within three-quarters of a mile fromthe South, while another force was closing in from the North. Theoperation was proceeding satisfactorily, but the Italian forces wereresisting stubbornly.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 29thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Secretary of State for Home Affairs and Minister ofHome Security gave the following information: Night of ISth/lQth. 370 aircraft had operated. Theraiding had been widespread, but the chief target had beenHull. Details were lacking owing to telephone damage, but20 fatal casualties had so far been reported. In Scarboroughthe casualties had been 3 killed and 30 injured.Night of 19th/20th. 220 enemy aircraft had attackedLondon. Most of the incidents had taken place in the east andsouth-east boroughs. 16 major fires had been started, but all had been mastered by 6-30 a.m. Serious damage had beenreported at Greenwich (including the victualling yard), atEdmonton and to the R.A.F. Depot at Kidbrook. The GasLight and Coke Company&apos;s Poplar premises, had been badly damaged, and 11 local authorities would be without gas for&apos; some days.  The casualties had been : London: 277 killed, 732 injured.FAseiohere: 13 killed, 13 injured.
3. The War Cabinet were informed of an exchange of tele-grams about American plans for sending foodstuffs to unoccupied france (1169f 1198 rand 1225 from Washington, 146lH;o Washing-ton). The Prime Minister had since received a personal telegramfrom the President, which confirmed that our policy and that ofthe United States was in line on the matter.The Prime Minister said that the United States were about tosend two food ships to Unoccupied France. These must be letthrough the blockade unconditionally. But we must make it clearthat we were not abandoning the blockade of France, and it was important that we should stop a convoy in the near future. Afterrummaging the vessels for such articles of contraband as rubber(which, if found, should be removed), it would probably be desirableto let them go. The presence with a convoy of a small French Navalescort ought not to deter us.The need for action was shown by an article in UCEuvre inwhich M. Marcel trade at said &quot; it was sufficient simply to talk ofescorting French Naval vessels to throw the war-mongers&apos; campaigninto confusion.&quot;The First Lord of the A dmiralty gave particulars of the naval units likely to be available for this operation in the near future.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to work out withthe Minister of Economic Warfare and the ForeignOffice a scheme to give effect to this policy.(2) Agreed that the First Lord of the Admiralty should have authority to give orders for the interception of a furtherconvoy of French ships proceeding to unoccupied france.Blockade.France.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 28thConclusions,Minute 3.)Blockade.Application to japan.The AsdkdMaru.(previous reference:W.M- (41) 28thConclusions,Minute 9.)4. The War Cabinet were informed that the A saka Maru had left Bilbao on the 19th March and might intend to call at Colomboto re-fuel. Or, again, she might call at any British or Allied porton the Cape route to Japan. Instructions must be issued to dealwith this, but there should be no publicity about our intentions.The War Cabinet decided as follows : (1) The First Lord of the Admiralty was authorised to instructall British ports at which the A saka Maru might callthat no facilities should be afforded unless she submittedto our normal Contraband Control. If the A saka Marudid not comply, she would not be allowed to take supplies on board, or to remain in port.(2) Since the vessel might, call at some South African port, theDominions Secretary was asked to send a telegram tothe Union Government, explaining the position and theaction we intended to take.(3) The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign. Affairs was asked to inform the Netherlands Governmentin due course of the action proposed, and to invite themto act accordingly..The suggestion was made that one of the reasons for theGerman attack on Clydebank had been that they thought it to be a centre of communism and disaffection. It might be worth whileconsidering whether public use could be made of this, i.e., that theGermans were likely to attack areas thought to be centres ofdisaffection.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
The Balkans. 5.   The War Cabinet were reminded that no official announce-Military Policy, ment had yet been made that any of our troops had landed in Greece.(Previous T^,e Prime Minister said, there were strong reasons againstReference: making this announcement. First, Mr. Eden and General WavellW.M. (41) 27th were against it, and the Greeks also opposed it. Secondly, althoughConclusions, the Germans knew that our troops had landed, they might make a minute 2.) public announcement on our part a pretext for launching their attck on Greece. Although the Press position was difficult to hold,he thought that we must accept the advice of those on the spot.The War Cabinet accepted this view.The War Cabinet also had before them further telegrams onthe Balkan position. A record of the discussion is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Great George Street, S. W. 1,March 20, 1941.

h.a.l./        DEPART;Q;?AL (SECRET)Viscount Halifax (Washington)15th March, 1941.10VI a.m. . 16th March, 1941.Decypher.10.0 a0m.16th March,1941.No. 1169.99999. IMMEDIATE.My telegram Noa 1130.Mr. Hull asked me to see him this morning.     His principalpurpose evidently was to compare notes on the attitude tobe adopted towards Vichy before he saw French Ambassador,who,had been, so he told me, trying to see him yesterday, andwhom he would have to see to-day.2.    Mr. Hull told me that he proposed to speak to the. French Ambassador very frankly upon the importance of theFrench Government not allowing itself to be pushed by Germany. beyond the armistice terms, and on the other side to make\ plain the desire of United States both to maintain its oldassociation with France9 and at the same time to help GreatBritain to v/in the war.     He would add that self-appoitedtask of the United States Government of trying to help France- and assist a better understanding between France and GreatBritain had been rendered very much more difficult by ill-timed declaration of Darlan about convoying ships.3.     Mr. Hull made it plain that he did not like the ideaof being pushed too formally into the position of mediatorbetween France and ourselves.    He also felt very considerabledifficulty about getting at once, or even very quickly, toas large a scheme of settlement as that contemplated in yourtelegram No. 1345.    He evidently judged that there was a real possibility, having regard to forces operating insideVichy Government, of proposals on such wide lines having   -contrary effect to that which we hoped.    He therefore preferred to try and proceed by more gradual stages.4.     I said that it was evidently to some extent a questionof method and that we must use the best means.    I stressedhowever that we wished to be sure of getting what we wanted.The principal desires of my Government were (1) to stopGerman infiltration into Africa-   (2) to get French fleet away from metropolitan ports, and (3) that the Americans should secure an adequate system of supervision and control for anyfood help that was sent.
5o     I asked him whether I might tell the Prime Minister-to &quot;expect. a ;reply from the President to his message,. and hesaid that&apos;tie-had little doubt that the President would answer,-the Prime Minister&apos;s recent message, hut he thought that       fanswer would not&apos; be very long and would be more or less on   i?lines on which he had been speaking to&apos;me060     Mr. Hull concluded by saying that he thought thatwe should be wise to be a little bit lighter on Frenchshipping, mentioning one or two ships whose interception hadbeen reported in Indian Ocean, and expressed the view thatthis caused much more irritation in Vichy than it was worth.7.     I realise that paragraph 3 does not represent any material change of approach by United States Government tothis problem and that in view of paragraph 3 of your telegramNo. 13^5 you fear that French Government would be unlikely to meet our requirements unless they were offered something more concrete,,     I appreciate this point but I think thatthere is also much force in United States argument thatif a comprehensive agreement were entered into and announcedGermany would at once suspect that French had given somequid pro quo and wo aid 1. J:   out to find out what it was and&quot;block ite  - Result might then well be to render position ofFrench Government even more difficult and ultimately to defeat our purpose0     Once supplies began to be distributedthe French people might begin to take courage and we might then have a real hope of gradually getting our desiderata.At the worst we should be no worse off for French people would know the source of supplies and if, owing to Germanconduct or fu..ther Vichy concessions to Germany, these werestopped reason for explaining our position would be greatly strengthened vis a vis not only French but also Governmentand public opinion of this country.80     Above represents broadly line of thought of UnitedStates Government.

They would tell French Government that they were willing to send two gifts of wheat cargoes in French shipsprovided(a) ships returned to this country after discharging their cargoes;(b) four conditions referred to in second paragraphof my telegram No, 800 were fulfilled.(b)   If this were done, they would take steps that weconsider necessary as regards German infiltrationinto North Africa,3.   United States Government would express the hope thatthey would gradually transfer French warships to North Africanports.- 4.   *[To he omitted]*5.   *It would he understood, if these assurances were carried out and the conditions fulfilled, and if we agreed to let the.two ships pass, then* United States Government would attempt to work out with us an arrangement whereby French couldbuy in driblets and ship under control to be agreed upon between United States and His Majesty&apos;s Government.6.   Welles hoped that you would at once agree to FrenchGovernment being approached accordingly and I hope I can haveyour immediate concurrence.
7,   I have since ascertained from State Department that ships In question are those referred to in paragraph 9 of yourtelegram No. 1117 and that cargoes might be those mentioned. JCargoes would however be bought by American Red Cross andshipped under latter&apos;s aegis.8.   You will no doubt indicate whether in the present/circumstances you wish to modify your views that theseshipments should not be navicerted.[Amendments contained in WashingtonNo. 1203].
Decypher.     Viscount Halifax (Washington).19th March, 1941.D.     6.15 p.m. 19th March, 1941.R.     5.10 aem. 20th March, 1941.No. 1225.hhhIMIjEDIATE.Your telegram No. 1461.Following for Prime Minister.Your message was probably sent before you saw my telegram No. 1198 to the Foreign Office which gave a clearer indication of line on which the UnitedStates Government are working.    You will have seen from it that they are taking steps to meet yourwishes and that, though they do not make transferof French Warships to North African ports a conditionof despatch of two gift ships whose unhinderedpassage, we were, in any case, ready to permit(last paragraph Foreign Office telegram No. 1275),they are now making German infiltration acondition and pointing the way as regards the Warships.This would merely be the preliminary stage and cueto further negotiations with us as regards futureshipments to be bought by the French and paid for bythem [?grp. omit, which] would follow.2e    Except for strictly medical supplies and limited supplies for children under the Red Crossarrangement, there is no question of the United StatesGovernment wanting to send anything hut foodstuffs to unoccupied France and I am confident that they wouldnot wish to interfere with any steps you might decide to take to prevent rubber and other war materialsarriving there on their way to Germany.3.    On receipt of reply to my telegram No. 1198,I will do my best to clear the position further withMr. Well[esJ who is acting Secretary of-State in theabsence of Mr. Hull.[Copies sent to Prime Minister],

kept under Lock and Key.]No. 1461.Cypher telegram to Viscount Halifax,Foreign Office, 18th March, 194DEPARTMENTAL (SECREgggggggggIMMEDIATE.Following from Prime Minister,,Begins.Your telegram No. 1169.This is very &quot;baffling.     We cannot allow the blockadeto lapse without anything to put in its place.     I certainlyunderstood that the United States Government felt quitestrongly that grain should be allowed into France under asystem of rationing, and that they would take a hand in this.Now that we accept their view, they recoil, and the onlyadvice I get is in paragraph 6 &quot;we should be wise to be alittle bit lighter on French shipping&quot;.    At the moment weare doing nothing to French ships, and convoys growinglarger every day are passing in and out of the Straits, themost part with only nominal escorts.     The policy of theGovernment is still that this traffic should be stoppedwhenever we have the naval strength conveniently to hand,and that even if they are escorted we should not be deterredso long as we have ample superiority of force.    A furtheroperation of this kind was ordered for the end of last week,but we postponed it pending a fuller exposition of Americanviews and wishes.     It is now due to come along again quitesoon,     I cannot believe the United States Government would wish us to do simply nothing and have the war prolonged by our letting all these cargoes, containing not only food butrubber and other war materials pass unhindered into Germany.We must know with some precision what the United States wantsand advises, or whether they would rather not he asked.Ends.Repeated Saving to Madrid No. 110 and Saving to LisbonNo. 157.
