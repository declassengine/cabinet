The War Cabinet were given the latest information as tothe military situation in the Balkans and Middle East.In Cyrenaica it was believed that our infantry formations had completed their withdrawal to the Tobruk area. The PrimeMinister thought that there were signs that the rush of the enemy&apos;sadvance was exhausting itself and that the situation gave less cause for anxiety. Particulars were given as to the dispositions of our troops.In the Balkans the Greek troops were holding out at the RoupelPass and on the Nestos Line. To the west of the Roupel Pass theposition was rather confused, but it seemed that the Yugoslav troops had given ground on the Strumica Valley. The German forcesadvancing via Kumanovo had captured Skoplje. The Yugoslavforces which had entered Albania might be taken in the rear by this force.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Air Raids.Damage.(previous references:W.M.
