(41) 23rdConclusions,Minute 8.)Food. 3    xhe War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theProposed Minister of Food, proposing an extension of rationing (W.P. (G)extension of (4i) 31). The Minister proposed to introduce a scheme of groupRationing. rationing. The first group to which the scheme would be appliedwould be preserves; i.e., jam, marmalade, treacle, &amp;c. Registrationwith a retailer would be a condition of consumers obtaining suppliesof any articles in the group. The retailer would be required byOrder not to supply consumers other than those registered with him,but it would not be an offence to sell to registered consumers morethan a stated amount. Retailers would be under an obligation todeal fairly as between registered customers; they would run therisk, on complaints being made, of having their supplies withheldand their customers transferred to other retailers.The stated amount should in the first month be 8 ozs. and,during this month, when registration would be taking place, theretailers would be prohibited from selling to a customer more than8 ozs. of articles within the group. At the end of the first month the scheme would come fully into operation and the Ministry ofFood would announce any change in the stated amount.The Lord Privy Seal said that the scheme had been consideredby the Food Policy Committee, and asked authority for the intro-duction of this scheme, and others on the same lines. There were already signs of shortages, which were likely to lead to queues.It was essential to tie consumers to a single retailer, so as to stop the habit of persons visiting a number of shops, in the hope of purchasing more of a particular article than their own retailer was prepared to sell them. Once registration had been introduced, it. would be necessary to impose some limitation on the amount whichcould be supplied; otherwise there would be a run on this class ofgoods. He thought that it was important not to delay unduly theimposition of rationing if in any case this was necessary.The First Lord of the Admiralty expressed complete agreementwith the principle that the consumer should be tied to a particularretail shop. But when registration had been effected, a limitationof the amount which could be supplied must follow in order toensure fair distribution of available supplies.The Minister of Food emphasised two new features in thescheme. First, that it dealt with a group of commodities insteadof with a single commodity.   Secondly, that no new penal offences
were created. Preserves were sold by the pot, and not by an exactweight, and it was therefore not possible to base a system of ration-ing on a precise measure of weight. The scheme in effect gaveformal recognition to what was already the practice of the betterretailers. He was satisfied that the Executive Committee would secure a fair distribution. The pre-war average consumption ofjam in the poorest household had been 2 - 6 oz. per head per week.The Prime Minister thought that the proposal raised seriousissues. The rationing of other commodities drove people to consumemore bread, and a shortage of jam was therefore a serious matter.He contrasted the amount of the weekly ration per person (2 ozs.),with the rations in the Forces 10 ozs. for a man and 14 for a woman. A very small reduction in the amount of wheat imported into the country would provide the extra tonnage required to importenough jam to maintain the present level of consumption. Wemust see to it that we imported sufficient delicacies to avoid anunduly austere diet. Attention should also be paid to bringing in articles in a less bulky form, so as to save shipping space.The Secretary of State for the Colonies drew attention to the stimulus afforded by Mobile Canteens to the consumption of bunsand other delicacies by the troops, over and above the very adequatedietary provided by their rations. The Secretary of State for Warsaid that steps had already been taken to limit the number ofCanteens and the hours they were open.The Minister of Food said that he would like authority to apply the group scheme to other articles as and when necessary. He hadin mind the introduction of a scheme to deal with cheese, thePrime Minister said he thought that no large change in the schemeof rationing should be made without consultation with the WarCabinet.The War Cabinet decided as follows: (1) Approval was given to the introduction of a scheme ofgroup rationing for preserves; i.e., jam, marmalade,treacle, &amp;c, on the lines indicated in the Minister ofFood&apos;s Paper.(2) Authority was given to the Minister of Food to applya similar scheme to canned fish and meat and preservesof fish and meat, without further reference to the WarCabinet.(3) Approval was given in principle to the introduction ofgroup rationing for other groups of commodities, subjectto any serious extension of the principle being broughtto the notice of the War Cabinet.(4) The Minister of Food was invited to examine what steps could be taken in order to increase the amount of the ration for preserves above the figure of 8 ozs., whichwould apply for the first month.Great George Street, S.W. 1,March 7, 1941.
