No detailed reports were available, but the raidappeared to have been successful.Owing to weather conditions there had been little air activity on either side.Shipping casualties since the last meeting of the War cabinet had been as follows: Ships lost By submarine : 2&apos; ships ...      ... &quot;)By aircraft: 1 ship: ... ......t   19,000 tons.By mine: 2 ships     ... ........jTo- this must be added belated reports ^of two ships sunk...      ...      ....     12,000 tons.Total ...............     31,000 tons.Ships damaged By submarine: 1 ship.By aircraft: 7 ships.By mine: 1 ship.Most of the vessels attacked had been sailing independently.There were no recent reports of U-boat attacks in the North-WestApproaches. Enemy U-boats; were now mainly operating in the azores and the Cape Verde Islands area.The Secretary of State for War said that the: German HighGommandi h&amp;ds broadcast a-. communique stating that they had taken prisoner 6\ British: generals, 2 colonels and 2,000 troops at Derna.We should have to issue a communique. Should&apos; we admit thatGenerals O&apos;Connor, Neame and Gambier-Parry were missing?The Prime Minister thought that the names- of these threegenerals should appear in the communique^ which should state thatjpaft. of our rear-guard hadt been cutoff, and that our. main force was now- in the Tobruk area.Our troops; and Greek troops were holdings a line MountOlympu&amp;T-River AJiakbjnon-Florina (covering the Monastir Gap).There-was: no sign of, the main Greek. Army shortening their line and falling?,hack,from theiradvanced positions in-Albania.Greek.troops were believed- to be, still holding, out to the North-East of Salonika, although.cut off; by the German, advance.[22416] . b 2
Eritrea and In Eritrea our troops had taken Massawa, from which theAbyssinia. enemy were retreating in a southerly direction; We were movingagainst Assab. A telegram was being sent off by the Foreign office that morning suggesting that the Emperor Haile Selassie might now make his headquarters in Addis Ababa.The War Cabinet  \   -(i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Authorised the Secretary of State for War to issue a press communique on the lines proposed at    A.Air Raids.Damage.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 37thConclusions,Minute 3.)Eire.Future Policy.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 31stConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Minister of Aircraft Production said there had beendamage to the B.S.A. and Austin factories, but that the raids on theprevious night had not inflicted any very serious losses on the-aircraft industry.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.(1)(2)The War Cabinet had before them the following Papers :AReport of his visit to Ireland, by the Prime Minister ofthe Commonwealth of Australia (W.P. (41) 82).A Telegram from the Admiral Commanding the battle cruisers to the Admiralty (W.P. (41) 79).(3) A Memorandum by the secretary of State for Dominion&quot;Affairs (W.P. (41) 64).The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that when his paper had last been before them the War Cabinet had not considered whether we should now ask President Roosevelt whether he would be willing to take the initiative in an immediateapproach to the Eire Government on the question of base facilities.The Prime Minister thought that it would be better to awaitdevelopments before making this further approach. If the time came when the United States were prepared to escort convoys to thiscountry, they would then almost certainly be ready to bring strong pressure to bear on the Eire Government.The War Cabinet decided against a further approach to president Roosevelt at this stage.The next point discussed was whether the Dominions secretary should pay a visit to Dublin, in the hope that this would lead toMr. de Valera and some of his colleagues coming to London?Mr. Menzies thought that Mr. de Valera was very ill-informed on Ireland&apos;s place in the general strategy of the war, and that a personal interview with the Prime Minister might remove many ofhis misconceptions. In any event,,no harm could ensue from such discussions, or from making an attempt to bring them about, moreespecially since opinion in: Eire was overwhelmingly sympathetic tothis country.This view met with a considerable measure of support. On theother hand, it was argued that it was most unlikely thatMr. de Valera could be induced to pay a visit to this Country at thepresent time, or that, if he Came here, any results would follow. Healready knew that if Eire was prepared to abandon its neutrality(a) we were ready to share our air defences with them; and (b) wewould be ready to set up a Defence council for All-Ireland, in thehope that a united Ireland might spring therefrom! There was nothing more which we could tell him. The Prime Minister thoughtthat only the closer approach of the United States to the war wouldlift the Irish problem into a new setting.
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thought that a visit by him to Ireland at this juncture, except to endeavour to persuade Mr. de valera to visit this country, would serve no useful purpose. He would only have a number of requests made to him,e.g., in regard to petrol and food, which he would have to refuse.The War Cabinet Conclusions were as follows:-(1) For the present, we should not ask President Roosevelt tomake an approach to the Eire Government on the basesquestion.(2) No overt steps should be taken, for the present, to inviteMr. de Valera to visit this country, and the proposal that the Dominions Secretary should visit Dublin shouldnot be pursued.(3) The Dominions Secretary was invited to take discreetsoundings in certain quarters as to the possibility ofMr. de Valera accepting an invitation to come to London.(4) The attention of the Departments concerned was invited tothe importance of emphasising, in any public statements,that the shortage of shipping was the reason why we hadto refuse to supply certain commodities to Eire.Great George Street, S.W.1,April 10, 1941.
