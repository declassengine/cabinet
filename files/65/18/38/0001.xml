6. The War Cabinet were informed that, earlier in the year,the Secretary of State for War had raised the question whetherLord Gort&apos;s despatches should be published. Lord Gort was himselfanxious that his despatches should be published, and there had been some feeling in the Army that it would be a good thing that an authoritative account should be published. The Secretary of Statefor War, after consultation with the Prime Minister and other ministers concerned, had accordingly stated in his speech on theArmy Estimates that the despatches would be published. under present arrangements, publication would take place in the middleof June.The Prime Minister said that he had now received a Minutefrom the Minister of Information to the effect that publication ofthese despatches at the present moment would be inopportune.In discussion, it became evident that the general feeling of theWar Cabinet was in agreement with this view.The War Cabinet accordingly (1) Agreed that the publication of Lord Gort&apos;s despatchesshould be suspended for the time being.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to arrange for copiesof the despatches to be circulated to the War Cabinet.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the circulation to the War Cabinet of a despatch by Sir RonaldCampbell describing the last days of the French Govern-ment in Paris and in Bordeaux, before the collapse ofFrance, with a view to consideration being given to thequestion whether it should be published.7. In connection with the preceding item, the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs said that numerous enquiries had beenreceived from the Dominions in regard to the steps which we hadtaken to carry out our pre-war undertakings to France. He askedwhether it would be a good plan that a statement should be publishedsetting out what those obligations were and the steps we had takento give effect to them.The War Cabinet were informed that a statement on theselines had been prepared, and asked that copies should be circulated to them.Egypt. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to hiscolleagues a note which he proposed should be issued to BritishConsular Officers in Egypt, instructing them how to deal withenquiries from members of the British colony in Egypt as to whetherthey should remain in the country or leave it. The upshot of theinstructions was that, while the British colony as a whole should stand fast, women and children, who were not engaged in work ofnational importance, might register at the Consulates, and wouldbe informed as to the opportunities open to them to leave Egypt.The Prime Minister said that it was most important that no^ instructions should be issued which ran counter to the principle that1/ we must stand fast and fight it out in Egypt.The War Cabinet approved the issue by the foreign secretary of the proposed instructions.Further discussion as to precautionary measures in Egypt is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Great George Street, S.W. 1,June 12, 1941.The western front.proposed publication ofLord GorfsDespatches.France.Fulfilment of undertakings by great Britain.

R. 6.05 a.m. 12th June^,IMMEDIATE. /////                      ./MOST SECRET. &apos;                       &apos; /Commandante Aranda visited Military Attache latelast night on behalf of his brother who was being so closely watched by Falange agents that he felt itinadvisable for,our sake as well as his own that theMilitary Attache and he- should meet.     He came to conveyfrom General Aranda four important points.(1)   France gave the order for mobilisation of metropolitan army and the army in French Morocco June 6th.(2)   France has given Germany permission to enterSpain through unoccupied France.     Above information isknown to the Spanish&quot;Government as it comes from SpanishAmbassador in France.(5)   There is every reason to believe that Germanyand France have agreed to unite forces in order to enterSpain with a view to attacking Portugal (not Gibraltar).The date when this operation is to be undertaken is not known but all the information and evidence regarding the &apos;supply and other preparations points to it being undertaken at early date.    Above information may or may not be knownto the Spanish Government but it originates from GeneralAranda&apos;s best French sources,(4)   No agreement of any kind exists between spain and Germany for the latter to enter Spain either to attackSpain or Portugal.IT    In subsequent conversation Aranda stated: (a)just Heard that army in Morocco are preparing &quot;bases dePartida&quot; on Spanish frontier.     (b) General Aranda has noidea either what Franco is thinking, what his plans are or what he intends to do.  - General Franco is isolated, illinformed and only Suner has his ear.     (c)   Spanish army will undoubtedly resist if German demand to enter Spain isin the nature of violent ultimation or if the Germans insist on entering Spain against Franco&apos;s wish,    (d)   Fact that france is either facilitating Germany&apos;s entry into Spainor co-operating ,with her in so doing will have mostunfavourable reaction in Spain and be most favourable to us.ill   Commandante Aranda laid the whole blame for presentsituation on Suner.V     General Aranda will continue to keep the military attache informed of developments through his brother&apos;.&quot; 1     I am doing my best to check this information from our be&quot;st sources and in particular to discover more clearlywhat General Aranda will do in view of these Franco Germandevelopments.

D. 1,25 a.m., 12th June, 1941.No. 2705.11th June, 1941. R. 9.35 a.m., 12 h Jme^CIMMEDIATE. -                          XGleam No. 66. /        VFollowing from Military Mission for Chiefs^of Staff.Harry Hopkins informed the Military Attache&quot; that american Minister at Cairo has reported considerabledissatisfaction existing among Australians and New Zealanderqjji the Middle East.     Apparently the feeling prevails thatthey have he en let down and that they have not receivedadequate material.     It seems that there is even sometalk on their part of desire to return home.2.    Another similar matter which we feel oughtto he cleared up is the continued reporting by UnitedStates Minister at Cairo of low morale of the Royal AirForce in the Middle East due. he states, to inferiorityin quantity and quality of aircraft, also had &quot;behaviour of aircraftsmen m Cairo, also chaotic conditions atTakoradi.    If these reports are true they obviouslyought to he remedied &quot;by the Air Ministry, hut if untrueand we suspect they are - and exaggerated to the not too-friendly State Department division concerned    perhapsHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador would have word with Kirk.
