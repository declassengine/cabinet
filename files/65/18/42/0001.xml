The German attack north of the Pripet Marshes,Germany- aimed probably at Leningrad and Moscow, had made some progress,U.S.S.R. but the Old Russian frontier had not yet been reached.   further south the Germans did not seem to have made much progress.Syria. There had been  stiff fighting in Syria.    Damascus  andMerjayoun were now in our hands. We had advanced 10 or 12 milesalong the Damascus-Beirut road.The Secretary of State for War was asked to circulate to theWar Cabinet Telegram No. C/75935 from General Wavell about therecent fighting in Syria.The attitude of the Vichy French Commanders in Syria seemed(Previous to have stiffened.  The Foreign Secretary said that steps were beingReference: taken to make it clear that the inclusion, in any terms for theW.M. (41) 6lst cessation of hostilities, of a provision to repatriate military or civilConclusions, personnel who were unwilling to adhere to the Free FrenchMinute l.)       movement only held good for a limited time.Later in the Meeting the Prime Minister said that he hopedthat the names would be published of the Cavalry units which were now engaged at Palmyra.

Finland. The Russians had bombed Finnish aerodromes, and the Finns(Previous had declared. that they would defend themselves against RussianReference: attacks. The prospects of Finnish neutrality being maintained were.M. (41) 62nd not very bright.Conclusions,Minute 6.)The political crisis continued. The Foreign Secretary&apos;s pro-visional view was that the Japanese were more likely to continue their forward movement in Indo-China and Siam than to tryconclusions with the Russian Army in the Far East.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Japan.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 53rdConclusions,Minute 3.)Shipping.Publication ofShipping Losses.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 61stConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Prime Minister said that at a Press Conference that morning he had informed the Press that we should cease publicationof the figures of shipping losses after June. This had been acceptedwith a good grace.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Shipping.Enemy Ships in neutral Ports(previous reference:W.M. (41) 7thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of War Transport (W.P. (G) (41) 60).The Minister said that there had been rapid developments since his Paper had been written. Mr. Sumner Welles had now proposedto the Inter-American Committee that enemy merchant shipsimmobilised in South and Central American ports should be takeninto use on inter-American trade routes, the purchase price beingblocked until after the war. We had seen some objection to thiscourse on two grounds: First, that we wanted to see some of theGerman and Italian ships now immobilised in these ports employedin trade to the United Kingdom. Secondly, that the scheme seemedto involve some prejudice to our belligerent rights.It had been necessary to act rapidly in this matter, and it hadbeen decided that, on the whole, the best course was to signify our general concurrence in the scheme, subject to such satisfaction aswe could obtain on these two points.  Mr. Welles had now replied(a) that our position in regard to our belligerent rights would bemade clear in the resolution to be adopted by the Committee; and(b) that the question of employing some of these ships on trade tothe United Kingdom had better be taken up later on during thediscussions; but he hoped that some arrangement satisfactory to us would be reached.While this did not give us all that we had hoped for, it would represent some easement in the position. The use of enemy shipping on inter-American routes would free other tonnage for UnitedKingdom routes.The Minister of War Transport added that the arrangementnow proposed in regard to enemy merchant ships in South and central American ports was, of course, separate from the agreement regarding enemy ships in United States ports.

(41) 139) could be considered.,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that thediscussion in the House of Lords on the previous day had shown thatthe Press generally favoured giving further powers to the Ministryof Information.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.United States ofAmerica.Invitation torepresentativesof BritishIndustry.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 59thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Lord Privy Seal said that he had been invited by theWar Cabinet to make recommendations regarding the composition of the Mission from British industry which was to visit the UnitedStates. He had seen Sir Walter Citrine, who had asked leave to consult the Trades Union Council about representatives from the employees&apos; side; this Sir Walter had done on the previous day.Unfortunately, a leakage had taken place and the list of the TradesUnion Council nominees and details of the scheme had appeared inthe Press that morning. This was very unfortunate, as president roosevelt had asked that it should be kept secret.The War Cabinet-(a) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to make strong representationto the Trades Union Council, pointing out that leakagesof this kind, if continued, would make impossible con-fidential consultations with that body.(b) Invited the Minister of Information to take steps to prevent any further reference in the Press to this Mission.foq*office&apos;frGibraltar. 5.   The War Cabinet hadiiefore them a Memorandum by theEvacuation bf Chiefs of Staff (W.P.

Prisoners ofWar.Proposal tobring 25,000Italian prisoners to this country.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 57thConclusions,Mintfte $.)8. The Secretary of State for War said that the War cabinet should know that the ships bringing Italian prisoners of War fromthe north of East Africa to this eorintry would be unescorted, at anyrate for a considerable part of the journey. There was a risk thatwe might be accused of a breach of the Prisoners of War Convention.The First Lord of the Admiralty doubted whether there wasvery much in the legal point, having regard to the illegality ofGerman submarine warfare. While the ships could not have oceanescorts, he would see whether escorts could be provided in the dangerous areas.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the arrangements for the despatch of italian prisoners of war to this country should proceed, notwith-standing that the ships would be unescorted for thegreater part or possibly the whole of the journey.(2) Took note that the First Lord of the Admiralty wasexamining whether an escort could be provided in the dangerous areas.Turkey. 9.   The War Cabinet took note of a decision reached by theSupply of Defence Committee at their Meeting on the previous night.   the munitions, &amp;c.   Committee had had before them (previous reference erence:W,M. (41) 44thConclusions,Minute 7.)(a) A Report by the Chairman of the Committee for theCo-ordination of Allied Supplies, requesting a decision as to whether any alteration in the present instructions as to priority and procedure for supplying Turkeywith war material and supplies should! be made(W.P. (41) 138).(6) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, urging that the existing priority should, for thepresent, be retained in force (W.P. (41) 141).The Committee had approved the proposals contained in theMemorandum by the secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(W.P. (41) 141), namely :-(i) That the present priority to Turkey should be maintained and the present War Cabinet policy as regards both military and civil supplies should continue to befoUowed (vide W.P. (41) 138, Appendix).(ii) That we should inform the United States government accordinly, and ask them to conform their action underthe Lease-Lend Act to our own.Great George Street, S.
