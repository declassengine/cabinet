Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 55thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Crete.naval operations.Shipping Losses.The Bismarck.MilitaryOperations.Crete.Iraq.1. The Chiefs of Staff made the following reports in amplification-cation of Cabinet War Eoom Eecords Nps. 635 to 638 : Summary of aircraft losses since the 29th May :-Home Theatre Enemy 8 destroyed.3 damaged.Our own 2 Coastal Command Aircraft.Overseas Theatres Enemy 23 destroyed.5 probable.9 damaged.Our own 11 Aircraft.On the previous night we had destroyed 2 and damaged 2 enemy bombers.It was estimated that 25 per cent, of the German Air Force hadbeen employed against Crete and more than 25 per cent, of hertransport aircraft. The enemy might have lost 400 aircraft in theoperations against Crete. shipping losses during the previous four days had been 5 sunk by submarine, one by aircraft and one by mine, totalling 37,000 tons.One merchant ship of 3,000 tons had been damaged.Attention was called to a B.B.C. broadcast made by a military officer who had been on board one of His Majesty&apos;s ships in theBismarck action, which had given an unfavourable impression ofour ships&apos; gunnery. Enquiry was being made by the Admiralty intothis matter, and a copy of the broadcast should be circulated to theWar Cabinet.A full report would also be made regarding certain aspects ofthe action which, prima facie, seemed to require explanation.Seventeen thousand of our troops had been evacuated fromCrete. Our losses amounted to between 7,000 and 8,000 killed,wounded or prisoners. The German losses had been considerably in excess of these figures.The War Cabinet had a discussion of the events prior to theevacuation of Crete, a record of which is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The position in Iraq had been cleared up with the flight ofEashid Ali and his Government. But the armistice terms, whichhad been signed by General Clark on his own responsibility withoutreferring the terms home for approval, were not all that could be desired. After discussion that morning at the Chiefs of staff committee, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had telegraphedto the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, asking if they were\satisfied with the position. The importance of securing Mosul was emphasised.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Foreign Affairs.Turkey.&apos;(previous reference:W.M. (41) 51stConclusions,Minute 3.)[22583]2. The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs said that hewas urging M. Sarajoglu to delay opening conversations with theGermans. A telegrarrif prepared in consultation with the Chiefs ofStaff, had been despatched to give him a full appreciation of themilitary position in the Middle East.B 2
U.S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 42ndConclusions,Minute 3.)The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to see M. Maiskythat evening. He intended to say to him that the Germans were trying to make trouble between Russia and ourselves in the middle east, and that, while we intended to insist on our rights (as in Iraq),there was no reason why this manoeuvre should succeed. He also proposed to say to him that, if Russia was attacked by Germany, wewould take action elsewhere to relieve the pressure/A telegram had been sent to Sir Stafford Gripps recalling him for consultation.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 55thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gave the following report: By day there had been very little enemy air activity over thiscountry since the last Meeting of the War Cabinet: Night of 30th/31st May. About 100 enemy aircraft hadbeen in operation over land, and 40 mine-laying. Liverpool,South Wales and Bristol had been the principal districtsaffected, but there had been no concentrated attack. damage and casualties had not been severe. Bombs had been dropped on Dublin.Night of 31st May/1st June-70 or 80 aircraft had attacked the Mersey area. Casualties and damage had beenslight.Night of 1st 12nd June. A fairly heavy attack had developed on the Manchester district by about 80 aircraft. Sofar, 28 persons were reported as killed and 16 seriously and120 slightly injured.The Arabs. 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFuture policy.    Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (41) 116).The Foreign Secretary said that the policy in the paper inregard to Syria, which was now being applied, comprised severalelements which were not easy to harmonise.In discussion, the importance was urged of not treating Syriaas a single indivisible unit. Before the war the French had worked out a scheme for giving independence in Syria to the Arabs, to theChristians in the Lebanon, and to the Druses. While we could not commit ourselves, to details, we should probably favour a scheme onthese lines. The declaration to be made by General Catroux, onbehalf of the Free French movement, mentioned specifically &apos;&apos; theindependence of Syria and the Lebanon.&quot;The War Cabinet-Gave general approval to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s recom-mendations as outlined in paragraph 11 of his Paper,subject to the above discussion.Cyprus.-j-, . 5- Jfcf War Spinet had before them two Memoranda on theFuture of Cyprus (W.P, (41) U8 and 119) by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for the Coloniesrespectively.Attention was drawn by the Galonwl Secretary to certain points m regardto the defence p.f.CyprW?, ,The Prime Minister saidthat he was anxious that the Chiefs of Staff should again examinethe measures to be taken for the defence of Cyprus.
Discussion turned mainly on the question whether it was desirable to take any steps at this stage to counteract a German move to represent themselves as liberators who intended to hand overCyprus to Greece. The view generally expressed was that the greeks were not likely to be taken in by this pose, and that therewere various disadvantages in taking action on the lines of courses (ii) and (iii) tentatively suggested in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper.The War Cabinefs decision was That the Foreign Secretary should not at this stageinitiate discussions with the Greek Government on thefuture of Cyprus. If, however, the matter was raised, hecould reply that we were prepared to discuss the future of cyprus with them after the war as part of the generalpeace settlement.6.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (W.P. (G) (41) 52), to which was attached aReport by Sir Malcolm Robertson, M.P.(ii) A Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(W.P. (G) (41) 54).In his Memorandum the Foreign Secretary said that he was ingeneral agreement with the scheme of reform suggested by Sir M.Robertson, and asked approval for the general line laid down in his recommendations and for the introduction of those reforms which required legislation and the immediate expenditure of public money.Discussion turned on the recommendation for the introductionof a pension scheme enabling the Secretary of State to retire, on apension proportionate to his service, a man of the rank of first secretary or Consul and above, who had proved to be unsuitable forthe highest posts. The following were the main points made in discussion on this matter : (1) The Foreign Secretary said that he had at present powerto put en disponibilite indefinitely any officer of the combined Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service. Anofficer en disponibilite received no pay. The power forwhich he now asked would enable him to grant pensions to officers unfitted for further employment.(2) The Chancellor of the Exchequer feared that the scheme proposed would have repercussions on the Civil Service.Again, it would be difficult to enforce a unilateral rightto require premature retirement without giving someoption to members of the Service to retire on a propor-tionate pension after a fixed period of years.(3) It was also urged that it was unnecessary to retire all menwho were not fit for promotion to the highest posts.While such posts should be filled by the most rigorousselection, there must be other less onerous posts which those who did not. Comply with this standard couldnevertheless fill adequately.(4) The general view of the War Cabinet was that the diplomatic Service differed from the rest of the CivilService in that it was difficult to find suitable employ-ment in it for elderly men who were not capable offilling the highest posts. Some power on the lines of theForeign Secretary&apos;s proposal was necessary for a reform
of the Diplomatic Service. The State should insist uponthe right to require the retirement from the diplomatic service of officers who were not suitable for the highestposts in that Service, without giving any correspondingoption to the individual to retire with proportionatepension when he so wished.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that provision should be madefor special entry into the Diplomatic Service, above the normal ageof entry, of persons with special knowledge of oriental matters.The Foreign Secretary said that the full scheme set out in his paper could not be introduced until after the war. He proposed toarrange for the details of the scheme of recruitment under the new scheme to be worked out with representatives of the Universities,and this point would be borne in mind.The War Cabinet-Approved in principle the general line of the scheme forthe  reform  of   the   Diplomatic   Service   set  out  in w.P. (G) (41) 52, and in particular the following : (a) The introduction of a pensions scheme enabling theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs to retire, ona pension proportionate to his service, a man of the rank of First Secretary or Consul and above whohad shown himself to be unsuited for the highestposts.Pending the introduction of a pensions schemeapplicable to a reorganised and self-containedForeign Service, there should be power to retire ona pension men unfitted for the highest posts.(b) A system of entry which would enable young men who could not afford specialised study to get the trainingnecessary for their career, and so widen the field of entry into the Service.(c) Financial arrangements, such as those suggested bySir M. Robertson, to be introduced as soon aspossible, so that the best man could be sent to anyvacant post.(d) Measures  to enable our diplomats abroad  to be suffiently numerous, well paid and well housed tobe able adequately and effectively to represent thiscountry.Agriculture. 7.   The Lord Privy Seal said that, at their Meeting on the livestock 22nd May,* the Food Policy Committee had reached certainPolicy. decisions on Livestock Policy.  These included arrangements for the(Previous .&apos;culling of dairy and beef cattle.  The Minister of Agriculture andEeference- Fisheries, while assenting to these proposals, had been anxious thatWM (41) 33rd ^e War Cabinet should be aware that the scheme for culling herdsConclusions might, he thought, give rise to criticism in certain circles.Minute 8.) The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Great George Street, S.W. 1,June 2, 1941.* F.P. (M) (41), 17th Meeting. Minute 2.

Unless you see any strong objection, I shall beglad if you will,riow convey to the Minister for Foreign affairs a personal message from me on the following lines,3.   Begins.   I am&apos; deeply grateful to His Excellency for keeping His Majesty&apos;s Government so frankly .and fully informed of his conversations with the German Ambassador, and of theviews and intentions of -the Turkish Government.   I am alsomost grateful to him for agreeing to delay things as much aspossible.4.   I feel bound in.all frankness and friendship to urge that Turkey stands to&quot;&apos;gain nothing&apos;&quot;by reaching a political agreement with * the Germans-, who invariably use such agreementsas a means to facilitate.the fulfilment of their military aims.Already, in the present instance,- the German Ambassador isseeking, to&quot; broaden the suggested neutrality guarantee intosomething not applicable to the Soviet Union, and beyond whatwas originally contemplated.    (Your telegram No. 1315paragraph 7).   I am entirely satisfied with His Excellencyysassurance that. in.any agreement reached with the Germans theAnglo-Turkish /Treaty will be formally safeguarded.   But I fear that once a political.agreement with Germany is reached,Turkey will find it increasingly difficult to maintain, anindependent foreign, policy,,such as she has hitherto done infoul weather, as in fair.&apos;:   In June of last year our outlook was far from bright; France..had been crushed, and although we had succeeded in withdrawing - our armies, their equipment was lostwith the result that we were then compelled to rely on our navy and Air Force for the defence of these islands.   Our confidence in our Navy and Air&apos;Force did not prove misplaced, and whenthe German&apos;High Command found that they could not operate their aircraft over the Channel and south coast by. day, and that theiraive. bombers are .no match for our fighters when sufficientaerodromes are available, the attempt at invasion was abandoned and with bitter disappointment Hitler followed the example ofNapoleon and turned his armies to the East.   Now the picture isvery different.-   The United States with their 130&apos; million people    ,have committed themselves to ensuring the defeat of the &apos;3a&amp;8rowers^. and with the fullest knowledge of all our circumstances have&quot;&apos;&apos;&quot;&quot; shown....
shown complete confidence in our victory.   Whilst inthe East and South Hitler has occupied vast territories,each successive advance locks up a further portion ofhis armies for the maintenance of internal security,5.   During the last fortnight fierce fighting has beenraging for the possession of Crete.   Here our forces have suffered,as we knew they would, from the lack of aerodromes   *from which fighters could support them, whilst the german forces had the use of a large number or aerodromes in greece, the Greek islands and the Dodecanese,   But thatdid not seem to us sufficient argument for making noresistance.   It is impossible at the present moment to give an accurate figure of the losses suffered by the enemy in their attack on Crete, but it is certain that many.-thousands of their picked and specially trained parachuteand air borne troops lie dead and that the air fleets whichhave taken part in this operation have been most severelymauled.   The unexpected resistance the Germans have met has undoubtedly &quot;set back their plans and inflicted losses inspecialised aircraft, and personnel which they can ill afford.If&apos;the Egyptian coast/were as hear to Crete as is the Greekmainland and if we had;thus been able to operate fighter aircraft over &quot;that island the outcome of the present battlewould have been far different.      Our military, and inparticular our air strength in the Middle East. has been receiving, and will continue to receive reinforcement.   at every geographical disadvantage.,, we think that we have &apos;rendered, a good account of ourselves.   We look forward to future operations, on more favourable terms, with no&quot; lackof confidence.6.   I am well aware that His Excellency was seriously disturbed by the recent rebellion in Iraq,   Proof of ourcontention&apos; that the Iraqi people had no heart in thisrebellion., which was merely fostered by a few extremists isshown by the rapidity with which it has crumpled,   once. .effective British force could be brought to bear.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government are now In a position to see that their rights are respected In Iraq,7.   In the meanwhile we are improving our position inthe Battle of the Atlantic.. Once again history, isrepeating itself in the.slow and steady conquest of sea power.Ever since Hitler made: his boast that he would out our life- ,line to America, sinkings of our mercantile marine have diminiwhilst the losses of his own submarines and Focke-Wulfaircraft have increased.   Proof that the Battle of the atlantic is going, in bur favour is afforded by the despatchof Germanyls newest battleship on an attempt to raid ourcommerce.   This risk would never have been taken at this timeof year when visibility is good, if submarines and aircraft were.giving the results that Hitler had promised,8.&apos; As regards the future, America&quot;has shown herdetermination that her supplies will reach us and enable usto continue, to build up our armies and air force from herboundless, resources.: . New bomber aircraft have now come intocommission each .of which carries many times the load borne by-those hitherto, employed, with results that will be apparentwhen the hours of darkness&apos; grow in the autumn of this year.9 c c o *
IK5*9.   I would make a personal appeal to His Excellencyto reflect carefully on all this before committing himself to a course, the outcome of which is so dubious,10.   As regards the Soviet Union I quite understand the reasons for which His Excellency finds it difficultto take the Soviet Government into his confidence, and Ido not wish to press him unduly on this point.     At the sametime I am convinced that it is most important to preventthe very real danger of Germany playing off Turkey againstthe Soviet Union, and I wOnder whether His Excellencywould agree to His Majesty&apos;s Government taking it onthemselves to sound, the Soviet Government as to how theyview the manifest German intention to bring intensivepressure to bear on Turkey.     No mention would of coursefte made of the possibility of Turkey contemplating the signature of a neutrality pact with Germany.     The demarchewould he merely exploratory, in the hope of being ableto draw, the Soviet Government without in any way committing the Turkish Government or giving away their policy.     i feel that Turkey will lose nothing by such action and i hope His Excellency may think that it would help him.     Ends.

OUTWARD TELEGRAM[This Document Is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government, and should bekept under Lock and Key.] - -163-[Cypher.]WAR CABINET DIS1To   SOVIET U.FROM FOREIGN OFFNo. 552.3rd June, 1941.Repeated to Angora No. 1259Tehran No. 246,Cairo No. 1843,4th June, 1941.SECRET.At interview&quot;:with Soviet Ambassador on June 2nd I told himthere were certain...important recent developments in the inter-national situation.-which..I wished to discuss on a confidentialbasis with him and his Government. &apos;.   We had been surprised thatthe Soviet Government should have.chosen the moment of RashidAIi&apos;s revolt to appoint a Minister to Iraq.     The Ambassadorinterjected that, as far&apos;as he knew, the Soviet.representative had never taken up his post.     I asked whether it was theGovernment1 s intention that he should now do so to the newly-constituted Government, &quot;and-M. Maisky clearly thought-that thiswas the procedure contemplated.     I continued that this,eventseemed to make it desirable that I should make plain the&apos;policyof His Majesty1s Government in the Middle East.     The,action taken in respect of Rashid Ali was only one- example of our determination to maintain our position&apos; throughout the middle east, including Iran..(Persia) and&apos;Afghanistan.-    We had no intention of allowing our interests m those countries to be attacked or undermined.   We fully realised that the- GermanGovernment were intriguing in every possible way against our interests in the Middle East and that they hoped, by theseintrigues, to bring British and Soviet interests into conflict.There was, however, no reason^ given good-will on both sides?why the German Government should be successful in thus stirringup trouble between the British and Soviet Governments in&apos; theMiddle East, provided that there was no misunderstanding betweenthe two Governments as to their respective positions.-    the ambassador here Indicated assent.,2.     I continued that we intended to maintain our rightsand interests as at present existing in all countries of theMiddle Ea&quot;st, while disclaiming any. intention to enlarge these interests at the expense of any third Power.     I assumed thatthe- Soviet Government&apos; were resolved to pursue a similar policy.1 should like to be assured on this point.     If both ourGovernments based themselves-on these same principles, it oughtto be impossible for the German Government,-to succeed&apos;in makingmischief between us in the Middle East.5.     T then explained thai from the information availableto us, it was clear that Germany was making considerable con-concentrations, of land, mechanised and air forces, against SovietRussia,,     I--had.&quot; no-doubt that the Ambassador was. better informedthan I couldsbe on this subject, but I thought that I should tell him of my information and. of the steps.that we were taking in the-&apos;- .&apos;&apos;  - -    ..-&apos;     &quot; - Middle East ...
Middle East.     We were continuing the reinforcement of our army and Air Force there by all possible means.     In respectof the air we were being greatly helped by American machineswhich were beginning to arrive in the Middle East and would continue to do so in the next few weeks on an ever-increasingscale.     In consequence we considered that we were now in aposition to hold our own in the air against any forces thatGermany could bring against us in the Eastern theatre.     Shouldthe Germans divert elsewhere a part of their Air Force atgresent concentrated against us in the Near East, e.g. againstoviet Russia, we should be in a position to take usefuloffensive action to relieve pressure against Russia.4.     After some further conversation on the position in eastern Mediterranean and Iraq, Ambassador questioned meclosely about Turkey.     I said that we were aware, of course,that Turkey was under severe pressure from Germany but thatthey were holding out against concessions asked of them andwere keeping us informed.     The Ambassador asked whether .German demands were economic only or went beyond that andwere political also.     I replied that I imagined that Germany-would follow her usual practice, beginning with modest demands and seeking subsequently to widen the gap.     I suggested thatif the Soviet Government wished to know more they should ask the Turks themselves.     The Ambassador replied that he was not sure that the Turks would welcome such an enquiry,.   I rejoinedthat I had no reason to suppose that this would be the Turkishattitude and if his Government wished I was perfectly willingto make such a sounding of the Turks myself on his behalf.   AsI had told the Ambassador on a previous occasion, we desiredto see relations between the Soviet and Turkish governments as close and cordial as possible.    The Ambassador deprecatedsuch action, saying that he only wished to.clear his own mind as to the true position.5.     M. Maisky then enquired whether I was convinced thatthe information which I had given him about German concentra-tions against the Soviet Union was accurate.     I replied thatit was always difficult to be absolutely certain on thesematters, but that the information I had&quot;given him was given in good faith,, and we believed it to be correct.     The Ambassador-said that he found it very hard to believe that Germany contem-plated taking military action against the Soviet, since thatwould be a very big undertaking.    While M. Maisky expatiatedwith emphasis on the strength of the Russian military position,I had a feeling that he might be trying to convince himself ashe went along,6,    M, Maisky said that it was possible that all theseconcentrations might be part of a war of nerves.    I agreed,and said that we did not attempt to deduce the purpose forwhich the Germans were taking this action, and I thought it quite possible that they hoped by these means to force fromthe Soviet Government concessions that it was not in their national interest to give,7.     M. Maisky then said that he supposed that I had made this communication to him as an indication of my government s. de sire to improve relations.     Could I not carrymatters a little further?    He had often spoken to me in thepast about the difficulty created by the Baltic question.Could we not make -a&quot;, further effort to reach  agreement on
3.t]f\s issue?     I replied that we were ready to settle thisquestion, hut I could not see that any lasting good wouldderive from our making concessions to them on the Balticquestion without any corresponding concessions being made bythe Soviet Government.     I did not believe in a policy ofappeasement towards Soviet Russia or anyone else, as I had explained on a previous occasion.     M. Maisky maintained thatthere should be no question of appeasement.     At the same time he assumed that we did attach importance to improvingrelations with the Soviet.     Recently his Government had made an agreement with Sweden about the. Baltic States.     Could not we ai least consider drawing up a plan in which we would showwhat we were prepared to offer&apos; to the Soviet in connexionwith the Baltic and what we hoped to receive from them inreturn?     If we had such a plan, it might then be possible tomake progress.     I told M. Maisky that I was prepared toconsider his suggestion and asked him whether meanwhile hewould be good enough to give me his Government&apos; s comments onthe communication I had made to him.     Clearly if the Soviet &apos;Government were able to assure us that they intended tomrsue a policy in the Middle East similar to our own and ifhey had no intention of joining with the Germans in any ofthe plans so much canvassed in the press against Iran.Iraq, and ourselves, then the atmosphere would be a better one in which to consider what next step was possible.     M. Maiskysaid that he would certainly report what I had said to hisGovernment and would come and see me again when he had hisGovernment1 s reply.
