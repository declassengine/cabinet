Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 52ndConclusions,Minute 1.)naval operations.Naval Battle inthe DenmarkStrait.eastern mediterranean.Crete.1. The First Sea Lord gave an account of the Naval engage-ment in the early morning of the 24th May between the Germanbattleship Bismarck and cruiser Prinz Eugen, and H.M. shipsHood and Prince of Wales. As the War Cabinet were aware,the Hood had blown up after about twenty minutes&apos; fighting. TheFirst Sea Lord also described the events leading up to and following the action. A record of his statement is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.A report had been received that H.M.S. Formidable had been bombed. It was not yet known what damage she had received.H.M.S. Grimsby, a sloop of 1,400 tons, had been bombed and sunknorth of Tobruk.General discussion followed as to the course of operations inCrete. During the last two nights we had landed a limited numberof troops and stores. German air-borne troops were holding theirground in the Maleme area and had attacked our troops west ofCanea, where severe fighting was continuing. A critical point inthe operations had now been reached. The War Cabinet were informed that a telegram had been despatched, emphasising the crucial importance of preventing any considerable reinforcement ofmen and material from reaching the enemy in the island at thisstage.Discussion also took place as to the adequacy of the prepara-tions in Crete to meet the scale of attack which had developed. ThePrime Minister informed the War Cabinet of the suggestions whichhe had made to this end during the past month.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Aliens.Application of conscription.2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that ascheme had now been worked out for the conscription of aliens inthis country, which he proposed to put before the Representatives ofthe Foreign Governments concerned, and to which he hoped theywould agree.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Blockade.French north africa.(previous reference:     &apos;W.M. (41) 32ndConclusions,   ,;Minute 5.) &apos;3. The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Govern-ment had received a report from Mr. Murphy, whom they had sentto see General Weygand. The latter had given certain assurances,which, however, seemed to him (the Foreign Secretary) to be unsatis-factory. Nevertheless, the United States Government wished tocontinue economic assistance to North Africa (Telegram 2325from Washington). It must also be remembered that Germanywished ,tq encourage Vichy to attack the Free French. There was thus fra danger that these supplies, if sent to General Weygand,&apos;   . -i would be used against them:The Prime Minister doubted whether the consignments whichthe United States Government proposed to send were of great con-sequence. It had long been the policy of the United StatesGovernment to combine inducements to the Vichy Government withthreats of more drastic action. On the whole, he was not disposed totake a very stiff line with the United, States Government on thismatter.[22556],b 2
The Minister of Economic Warfare said that a number of the commodities it was proposed to send, e.g., sugar and tea, were quiteharmless, but that this did not apply to the cargo of theSheherazade, which was carrying 13,000 tons of oil.The War Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to reply to Washington tothe effect that, while we agreed in general to their proposal,we wished to warn them that there was a risk that certaincargoes, included in these shipments, might be used againstthe Free French, and that we should be glad if this aspect of the matter could be kept in mind.4. The First Lord of the Admiralty raised the questionwhether we should issue, following a strong demand from Americancorrespondents in this country, a communique as to the attack on the atlantic convoy on the 20th May. The Germans had claimed nineships sunk we knew that six had been lost, but it was hoped thatothers might still make port. In the circumstances, it was difficultto issue any statement which would not give information whichwould be of value to the enemy.The Minister of State thought a communique should be issued.The United States correspondents in this country were highlycritical of our attitude towards the issue of news, and complained that German news in America would hold the field until we adopted a more forthcoming attitude on the matter.A general discussion followed in which the following points were made: (1) If this particular German claim was contradicted, it might lead us into the position of having to contradict everyinaccurate German communique. We must be guided bywhether publication of these losses would give informa-tion of military value.(2) It was stated that the Isolationists in America maintained that our Atlantic shipping losses were small. To statewhat our losses in this convoy had been would strengthen the hands of those in America who favoured giving usmore help.(3) On the other hand, to publish these losses at the momentmight, following the loss of the Hood, have a depressing effect upon opinion both in the United States of Americaand at home. Our action in releasing this informationjust prior to the Presidents speech might come in forcriticism.The War Cabinet agreed as follows :-      ,(a) For. the present, no communique should be published as tothe attack on the convoy on the 20th May.\b) President Roosevelt should be informed of the number ofships we had lost in the Atlantic Convoy attackedduring the previous week, and it. should be left to his discretion to determine what use lie should make of theinformation, subject to no disclosure being made of thefact that two of the ships torpedoed by the enemy were still afloat. : p  ,(c) The Admiralty should formulate., foreonsideration by theWar Cabinet, draft rules to govern the-publication of-  our naval and merchant shipping losses.Shipping.Publication ofShipping Losses.(previous reference:W.M.

Conscription.Application toNorthernIreland.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 52ndConclusions,Minute 3.)5.   The War Cabinet had before them the following furtherPapers on this matter : (i) A Memorandum by the Home Secretary as to the probablereactions of labour and the Roman Catholic Church(W.P. (41) 110).(ii) A Memorandum by the Home Secretary, covering a Reportby the Inspector-General of the Royal Irish Constabu-lary (W.P. (41) 111).(iii) A telegram from the United Kingdom representative in eire to the Dominions Office (W.P. (41) 113). this telegram contained the text of a message sent by theUnited States Minister in Dublin to Washington,strongly opposing the application of conscription to northern Ireland. A copy of this message had been communicated by Mr. Gray to Mr. de Valera.In the course of the Meeting, the following further information was given to the War Cabinet: (iv) The Prime Minister reported to the War Cabinet the upshot of the meeting which he and some of hiscolleagues had had with Mr. Andrews, the PrimeMinister of Northern Ireland, and some of his colleagues on Saturda^&quot;(v) The Prime Minister read to the. War Cabinet a letter of protest from Mr. de Valera/which Mr. Dulanty had handed to him.(vi) A telegram from Mr. Mackenzie King, Prime Minister ofCanada, was read out to the Meeting.&apos;^&apos;(vii) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs mentioned that a telephone message had been received fromSir John Maffey, reporting that there was considerableexcitement in Dublin, but that the speeches made in the dail had been moderate, and urging postponement of adecision.(viii) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home security informed his colleagues of a further message whichhe had received that morning from Mr. Andrews,indicating that the strength of the opposition would bemore widespread than had been realised. While,speaking for themselves, the Government of NorthernIreland would like to see conscription applied, the realtest, in their view, must be whether it would be for thegood of the Empire.Further discussion took placed and it was agreed to defer a finaldecision until the following day.Great George Street, S.W. 1,May 26, 1941.Rl**iJ.  ^tl&amp;*&amp;jwi   ^ fUi*4X  jEl^(d) The Lord President was authorised to give Mr. Harrimanparticulars showing the proportion of cargoes ofmunitions, &amp;c, lost in the months of January. february and March 1941.

Winston SoChurchill,   M.P.,Prime Minister.The Right Hon. J.M. Andrews,Prime Minister of NorthernIreland.The Right Hon. Sir Jo&quot;mAnderson, M.P., lord president of the CounciloThe Right Hon. J.P.

Lord Glentoran,Minister of Agriculture,Northern Ireland,,The Right Hon. herbert morrison, M.P. , Secretary ofState for the Home department and Minister of Home Security.The Right Hon. ViscountCranborne,   Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs.Sir Henry Pownall,   ViceChief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.[r. R. Gransden, Secretary tothe Northern Ireland Cabinet,Sir Edward Bridges.Secretary of the War Cabinet.MR. ANDREWS said that a successful Meetingof the Ulster Unionist Council had been held theprevious day.     The Council had been unanimously infavour of conscription in Northern Ireland.   although they appreciated that there were difficulties, theyhad given him (Mr. Andrews) a free hand to tellMr. Churchill to do what His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom thought was best for the Empire,,They were anxious to help in every possible way.

MR. CHURCHILL said that he was grateful forthis approach to the subject.       He suggested that discussion should proceed on the basis that it wasthe desire of the majority of the Parliament and thepeople of Northern Ireland that conscription shouldbe applied to Northern Ireland, and that thedifficulties inherent in this question should be examined on that basis.The following is a summary of the chiefpoints made in discussion on the main issue:-(1)   MR. MORRISON said that in logic there wasno valid argument against applying con-scription to Northern Ireland, but theconsequences of this course must be weighed.     He thought that any rebelliousactivities on the part of the I.R.A. couldbe dealt with.      The political consequenceswere probably the most formidable.     Whatwould happen if there was an extensiverefusal to register, instigated by political elements or by the roman catholic Church in Ireland?     It would bevery embarrassing if we had to put anumber of men into concentration camps.(2)    MR. BSVIN stressed the objections to thepresent position.     For example youngmencame over from Northern Ireland to takework here, and were sometimes billettedin the homes of men who had beencompulsorily enlisted.      This gave riseto difficulties.     The 60,000 extra menwho could be found from Northern ireland would be a very welcome help in the man-.power problems.(5)    Discussion ensued on the attitude towardsconscription of organised labour inNorthern Ireland.     Mr. Beattie had spoken strongly against conscription,but the meeting was informed that he hadbeen expelled from the Labour Party   and carried no weight... .  The attitude o Mr*i Midgeley. a.-.:. ;uhpoX&apos;tant figure in NorthernIceland Trade Union circles, had, beenpersonally favourable to conscription,but had indicated that there would be aconsiderable measure of opposition.From the labour point of view theopposition to conscription would be farless strong than would have been thecase had it been introduced before thewar.

(4)   LORD CRANBORNE thought that the eire government and the. Roman Catholic Churchwould be bound to oppose the applicationof conscription to Northern Ireland.    But,since most people in Southern Irelandhoped that we would win the war, he didnot think that the opposition of the SireGovernment would be very serious.   Ifhoveverv there vas serious rioting, tneattitude of Eire would have greatersignificance. ^Trouble^-as .most likely toSS&amp;p^fflt^S ^fe?ll&amp;0on;tn^rgf&amp;de3! wlsmust be prepared to carry it through.(5)    SIR HENRY POWNALL, asked for his views,said that the Army badly needed the menwho could be got from Northern Ireland.He did not think that rioting was likely,nor did he think the Army was likely tohave serious trouble with any unreliableelements which were handed over to it.It was true that the military authorities had had useful conversations with membersof the Eire General Staff,    with whomtheir present relations were satisfactory.It might be that if conscription was introduced into Northern Ireland, the eire government would put a stop to these conversations for the time being.      Thiswould not be very serious.(6)    SIR JOHN ANDERSON thought that the course proposed was right and that he would liketo see it adopted.      Once started on thiscourse we must go through with ito      trouble in the last war had arisen not so much outof the proposal to apply conscription toIreland, but through our having failed tocarry it through.     He thought that weshould not be unduly influenced by theopposition of the Eire Government, sincethe action proposed was none of their business.    The greatest risk of disorderwould, he thought, be at the very outset,when meetings of protest and processionsetc. might be held.      If it was decided toapply conscription to Northern Ireland,the matter should be put through quickly.The following were the main points dealtwith in regard to the methods of applying conscriptionto Northern Ireland, and related matters:-(7)    It was agreed that a Bill would benecessary.

(8)    Responsibility for administering thescheme,     MR.  CHURCHILL &quot;thought that theadministration   of the Act should be theresponsibility of the United kingdom governments        This was generally agreedto Mr. BEVIN said that he would propose touse the staff of the Ministry of labour in Northern Ireland as his agents.      Theresponsibility for setting up tribunals and dealing with appeals would&quot; rest withthe Ministry of Labour and NationalService.      The control exercised by his department in Northern Ireland would beanalogous to that exercised by one ofthe Divisional Controllerso       It would benecessary of course to bear in mind that national Service was closely linked up with Labour Supply and that both must bedealt with as part of a single problem.(9)    Conscientious ob.jectors and Schedule of reserved Ocoupations.    &quot; ME,&apos; CHURCHILLthought that the provisions in regardto   onscientious objectors and to theSehodu/c: of Reserved Occupa v; ens should apply to Northern Ireland on the same basis as this country, provided that men registered when called upon to do so.If, however,  they fails3.   to register, theyshoixld not be entitled to any advantages which they might derive either from theconscientious procedure or from theSchedule of Reserved Occupations,     Thiswould afford a great inducement to register and would tend to break up anyfoous of resistance^(10)    It was also suggested that it wasimpor ;ant not to allow the conscientiousobjector   clause to be abused.      Forexample a man must not be allowed tomake play with conscientious objectionsto this particular war,(11)   Procedure in regard to men who failed toregisterT&quot;     LORD GLENTORAN suggested thatthe procedure should be devised whereby,if a m-m did not register when calledupon to do so,, he could be brought beforethe Resident magistrates who would declarehim a deserter and he would thereupon be handed over to the military.General agreement was expressed that someprocedure on these lines should be adopted.,though it might be better to substitute-some othex&quot; tribunal for the ResidentMagistrates^

n o(12)   MR. CHURCHILL thought that if the schemewas worked out on the above lines itwould provide a safety valve.     Anothersafety valve would be provided by the factthat no doubt a certain numbor of men,who would otherwise offer opposition, would pass over the frontier into southern ireland.(13)    It was also hoped that the.call-up might take place gradually.MS.  BEVIN suggested that, in the firstinstance, three age-groups might be dealtwith, say, 23/24.     Later a further threeage groups could be called up.       Thiswould be better than calling up largenumbers at a time.(14)   Essential Work Order.     MR.  BEVIN suggestedthat it would be desirable that theEssential Work Order should be applied tothe Northern Ireland shipyards and thatthe men should get the benefit of the guaranteed week, etc.     There would be considerable advantage if the intention toapply the Essential Work Order to NorthernIreland could be announced at the sametime as the decision to introduce con-scription as being an essential part ofthe National Service enterprise.      Thiswas a matter to be dealt with by an order made by the Northern Ireland government.MR. GORDON said that a deputation of the engineers and Shipbuilding EmployeesFederation had come to him four weeks ago,and had asked that the Order should beapplied to them.     He had pointed out thatif the Order were applied, and later workdeclined    (e.g. , owing to the yards being put out of action through bombing), itmight be necessary to transfer the menacross the Channel.     He had asked them tothink the matter over and to put in aMemorandum.      They had not so far done so*It was left that this matter should beconsidered by the representatives of theNorthern Ireland Government.

(15)    Reinstatement and voluntary recruitment,,    attention was drawn to the fact that the guarantees whichhad been given in regard to reinstatement in civilian occupation after the war only coveredpersons compulsorily enlisted, and did not extend to those who voluntarily recruited.    It wassuggested that this was a matter which might befurther considered, irrespective of the decisionto apply conscription tD Northern Ireland.    Butit was agreed that it would be undesirable toinclude a clause on a matter of this kind inany Bill applying conscription to NorthernIreland.Timetable.MR.  CHURCHILL then dealt with the timetable.He would report the upshot of the present Meeting tothe War Cabinet on Monday afternoonc    The decision thenreached could be announced in Parliament on Tuesday.While no decision could be reached until Monday afternoon, work on the drafting of a Bill, on thelines discussed that morning,  should start that afternoonA draft of the Bill should be submitted, to a Meeting ofMinisters to be held at 12 Noon on Monday, preside over by the Home Secretary,  in order that the WarCabinet at their Meeting on Monday afternoon, should beahle to&apos;examine the project more fully.    If themeasure was proceeded with,  it should, he thought, becarried through all stages and passed into law &quot;beforethe Whitsun Recess.Great George Street,  S. W. 1.26th May.  1941.

ANNEX.III./S&quot;ee Minute 5.7CONSCRIPTION.Application to northern Ireland.(previous reference:W.M.(41) 52ndConclusions,Minute 3.)The War Cabinet had before them thefollowing further Papers on this subject:-(i) A Memorandum by the Home Secretary as tothe probable reactions of labour and the roman Catholic Church (W.P.(4l) 110).(ii)   A Memorandum by the Home Secretary, covering a Report by the Inspector-General of theRoyal Irish Constabulary (W.P.(41) 111).(iii)   A telegram from the United kingdom representative in Eire to the dominions office (W.P.(41) 113).     This telegramcontained the text of a message sent bythe United States Minister in Dublin to washington, strongly opposing theapplication of conscription to NorthernIreland.     A copy of this message had been communicated by Mr. Gray to Mr. de Valera.In the course of the Meeting the following further information was given to the War Cabinet:-(iv).  THE PRIME MINISTER read-to the War cabinet a message of protest from Mr. de Valerawhich Mr. Dulanty had handed to him.36(v)   A telegram from Mr. Mackenzie King, PrimeMinister of Canada, Y$a.s read out to.theMeeting.(vi)    THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs mentioned that a telephone message had beenreceived from Sir John Maffey reporting thatthere was considerable excitement in Dublinbut that the speeches made in the Dail hadbeen moderated, and urging postponement of adecision.     Sir John Maffey added that hewas sending over certain suggestions that night.THE PRIME MINISTER said that with certain of his colleagues, he had seen Mr. Andrews, the PrimeMinister of Ulster, together with other NorthernIreland representatives on the previous Saturday.The Northern Ireland Ministers had all expressedthemselves in favour of conscription.     Although theyanticipated some trouble, they did not think it wouldbe serious.     In order to make, the proposition more specific, he had asked the Home Secretary to preside over a meeting to draft a BilD/T    This draft was before the War Cabinet (W.P.(4l) 112).The Prime Minister added that, in view ofthe attitude taken by Mr. Winant the american ambassador, (who had visited him, and urged $hat theproposal would have important results)   he thoughtit would be wise to consult President Roosevelt, and^Appendix.I.

he read out a telegram to the President which he haddrafted.       He had arranged to postpone until Thursdaythe reply to the Question down for answer in theHouse.     He thought it was clear that, in the circum-stances, there could he no question of getting ameasure passed before the Whitsuntide Recess.THE HOME SECRETARY said that, on grounds of equity and logic, there could be no doubt that conscription should be applied to Northern Ireland.The more difficult question was whether thedifficulties involved were out of proportion to anybenefit which we should derive therefrom.       on saturday the representatives of the Northern ireland government had taken the view that, though therewould be some trouble, conscription could be appliedto Northern Ireland without difficulty.     But therewas now some alteration in their attitude.     He had had a further message that morning from Mr. Andrews,who had said that he wished the full facts to belaid before the Prime Minister.     The Northern ireland ministers wished it to be recognised that there wouldbe serious opposition to conscription.       While,speaking for themselves, they would like to seeconscription applied, the real test must be whetherit would be for the good of the Empire.     Hesuggested that it would be unwise to rush a decision.He had also had a visit that morning fromMr. MacDermott, the Minister responsible for public security, who had said that Mr. Andrews had asked himto say that opposition would be more widespread than he had anticipated, and would be organised.The Home Secretary also referred to areport by the Inspector-General of the Royal irish constabulary (Mr. Wickham), which had been circulatedto the War Cabinet (W.P.(4l) 111).       The Inspector-General thought that there would be organisedopposition in all the towns and villages, that thePolice would have to be used, and that shots would be exchanged.     The Roman Catholic Church would not give way, and sectarian feeling would be aroused.The Home Secretary said that he had asked whether itwould be easier if conscription was confined to civil defence Service.     Mr. MacDermott and Mr. Wickham had thought that this would be easier, but that even thiswould be opposed.The Home Secretary also referred to thefollowing resolution passed by the Executive Committeeof the Northern Ireland Labour Party on the previous day:-While not deviating one iota from ourbelief that Nazi aggression, if notdefeated, will result in a subjugatedEurope, ( inluding a subjugated Ireland,nevertheless we believe that beforeconscription is considered for application to Northern Ireland, a plebiscite should be taken of all adult

citizens in Northern Ireland on thebasis of the Parliamentary franchise,so that the question could beconsidered from the angle of deter-mining whether, having regard to the.large number of people who are opposed tothis principle it would be expedient oradvantageous to apply it or whether its application would, in fact, result inany accession of strength to the BritishCommonwealth of nations.At the moment this executive inclines tothe view that for the reasons mentionedany gains accruing from the applicationof conscription would be more than offset by disadvantages.He understood confidentially that the meaning of this resolution was that the Northern Ireland LabourParty were unwilling to associate themselves with various bodies, such as the I.R.A. , which opposedconscription, but that nevertheless the majority ofthem had been opposed to this measure.The &quot;Irish Times&quot;, which was normallyfriendly to this country, said that we had a rightto impose conscription, but hoped that we should not insist upon it.The Home Secretary said that his ownfeeling was that the difficulties of applying themeasure were very considerable and would result in agreat distraction of our war effort.     There wouldalso be repercussions in Parliament and the UnitedStates.     With great regret, therefore, he had reached the conclusion that the advantages to be gained by the measure were not sufficient to justifyits adoption.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICEoutlined the reasons which had led him to raise thismatter, and explained the difficulties which resulted from bringing Northern Ireland labour over to thiscountry.     There had also been a scheme on foot for bringing a considerable volume of labour over from southern Ireland to do agricultural work in thiscountry.     He also wished to see the Essential WorkOrder applied to Northern Ireland, and this could notbe done except on some such basis as the applicationof conscription to Northern Ireland.     He added thatrecruiting in Northern Ireland was handicapped owingto the fear that Catholics would take the place ofProtestants who enlisted.     The general view of people who had gone over from this country to deal with labour matters in Northern Ireland had also been infavour of applying conscription.It was clear, however, that the proposal had given rise to a storm of protest, and had brought theIrish Question into prpminence.     He thought that itwould be better not to take a decision that night,but to wait and see what suggestions Sir John Maffeyhad to offer.

THE PRIME MINISTER invited other membersof the War Cabinet to express their views.THE MINISTER OP STATE that that moreinjury would eome from not proceeding with thematter than from going through with it.The view of other Ministers may he summed up by saying that while, on grounds of justice andequity, they favoured the measure, on the ground of expediency they doubted whether we should obtainany advantages commensurate with the difficulties involved.     The new factor in the situation since thematter had last been considered was that the attitudeof the Northern Irish Government had changed andthat they clearly anticipated much more serious difficulties now than at the Meeting of ministers held the. previous Saturday.      This was a far moreimportant factor than the opposition of the eire government, which was to be expected, c.f. theprotests which had been made when the Coventrymurderers had been executed.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said thathe always distrusted organised agitation in Ireland.He thought, however, that it would be unwise toproceed with the measure, unless we had the assurance of the general support of the loyal section inIreland.     Our troubles in Ireland had often sprungfrom internal differences on our own side.There was general support for the view thata decision should be postponed until Sir John Maffey&apos;suggestions had been received.THE DOMINIONS SECRETARY said that consideration should be given to the suggestion thatMr. de Valera should be asked to come over for ageneral discussion.     He thought that Mr. de Valerawould find it difficult to refuse such an invitation,and that out of some general discussion we mightderive some advantage.The proposal to invite Mr. de Valera over here did not meet with general support.     THE foreign secretary said that it would be unwise to inviteMr. de Valera to come unless we were certain toderive some advantage from his visit.THE PRIME MINISTER said that although wewere not publicly committed to applying conscriptionto Northern Ireland, yet it was known that the matter had been under consideration, and any decision notto proceed with the matter would, he thought, beregarded as a recoil on our part, and was a serious matter.     For the moment he did not wish to reach adecision whether or not any statement should be madein Parliament the following Thursday.     The best coursewould be to defer taking any decision, and to awaitSir John Maffey&apos;s suggestions.      In the meantime, itwas of the utmost importance that no hint of the upshot,of the afternoon&apos;s discussion should be allowed tobecome known.Street, S.W.I.,, 1941.

APPENDIX I.14?High Commissioner 33-37 Regent Street,for Ireland. London, S.W.1.The following message was telephoned to me byMr. De Valera for transmission to Mr. Winston Churchill:-Mr. Dulanty has reported to me your conversationon the subject of Conscription in the Six Countiesarea.    Before your final decision is taken I feelthat I should again put before your Government asearnestly as I can my view that the imposition of conscription in any form would provoke the bitterestresentment amongst Irishmen and would have the mostdisastrous consequences for our two peoples.A feeling of better understanding and of mutualsympathy which held in it the promise of ultimateclose friendship had grown up between our peoplesin recent years.    The existence of Partition was theonly stumbling block, and there was the hope that inthe improved conditions it too would disappear.    Theimposition of Conscription will inevitably undo allthe good that has been done and throw the two peoplesback into the old unhappy relations,,    The Conscriptionof the people of one nation by another revolts the human conscience.    No fairminded man anywhere canfail to recognise in it an act of oppression upon aweaker people, and it cannot but damage Britain herself*The Six Counties have towards the rest of Ireland a status and relationship which no Act of Parliament can change.They are part of Ireland.    They have always been partof Ireland, and their people, Catholic and Protestant,are our people.I beg of you before you enter on a bourse whichcan affect so profoundly the relations of our twopeoples to take all these matters into the most earnestconsideration.(Sgd. ) JOHN W. DULANTYo

;   The Meet lag had before them a draft Bill preparedby Parliamentary Counsel xn accordance with instructions given orally following a Meeting of Ministers held on saturday, 24th May, at 12 Noon.Discussion on the draft Bill turned on four main points:-(l)   Was it appropriate that the Military ServiceHardship Committee should (as provided in clause 2 (2))be the tribunal to determine -(a) whether a particular individual fell within the scope of the Act;    and(b) whether he had a reasonable excuse forfailure to register under the Act?After discussion,  it was decided thatthe draft Bill should be amended so asto provide that these issues should bedetermined by the Courts of summary jurisdiction.(2)    After discussion it was agreed that the procedureset out in Clause 2(2) of the draft should be amended on the following lines:-If a man failed to register, and anenlistment notice was served upon him,that notice should state that if tiewished to claim (a) that he was not within the scope of the Act, or (t))that had a reasonable excuse for raothaving registered,his claim could come before the Courts.    Any such claimwould have to be made in the period between the receipt of the enlistmentnotice and the date on which theclaimant was called upon to join up.If the Court was satisfied that theclaimant had reasonable excuse for no&quot;&amp;having registered,  the Court shouldhave power to postpone the enlistmentnotice so that it would take effect asfrom a certain date, unless the manregistered within that period.(o;    is was agreed that in order to avoid discriminationthe procedure set out in Clause 2 which wasdiscretionary,  should apply not only to NorthernIreland, but also to the United Kingdom.    TheBill would therefore fall into two parts:    Part Ito amend the National Service Act (i.e., Clause 2of the present draft), and Part II to extend theNational Service Act, as so amended, to NorthernIreland0

(4)   The Parliamentary draughtsman was requestedto make sure that the Act would enable- persons enlisted under its provisions to be drafted for service in Civil Defence units,on the same lines as in Great Britain.It was agreed: -That a revised draft, amended as above,should be circulated, to the War cabinet at their Meeting at 5 p. m. that afternoon.Great George Street, S.we.,26th May, 1941.
