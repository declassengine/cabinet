Rudolf Hess. 1.   The Prime Minister said that he had considered making astatement that day in the House of Commons in regard toRudolf Hess, but had thought it better to wait a little while.There was no pressure for an early statement.Hess should be held by the War Office as a prisoner of war*He was also a prisoner of State, and should be kept in isolation and only allowed visitors approved by the Foreign Office.Discussion followed on the attitude of the Press. The general effect of what had been published had been almost laudatory, andthere had been no reference to Hess &apos;s record, which was as bloodyas that of any of the Nazi leaders. He was one of the war criminalswhose fate would have to be settled by the Allies after the war.The general view was that guidance should be given to the Press onthis matter.The Secretary of State for Air referred to the effects on the duke of Hamilton, who was a Serving Officer in the Royal AirForce, of untrue statements that he (the Duke) had received letters from Hess.The War Cabinet-(a) Invited the Minister of Information to give guidance tothe Press to refrain from any sentimental referencesbelauding Hess, and to include reminders of his badrecord as one of the Nazi leaders.(6) Agreed that no visitors should be allowed to see Hesswithout the approval of the Foreign Office.(c) Invited the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister ofInformation to see the Duke of Hamilton and todetermine what guidance should be given to the Pressas to the Duke&apos;s connection with the affair.Naval, Militaryand air operations,(previous reference:W.M.

Africa* -4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theAdministration Secretary of State for War on the form of administration to beof Ethiopia.      adopted in Ethiopia (W.P. (G) (41) 49).(Previous The proposal made in the Paper was that His Majesty&apos;reference: Government were the occupying Power until the Peace. TheW.M. (41) 19th Emperor (whose claim to the throne was recognised) should resumeConclusions, his throne at once, in fulfilment of our intentions, and would alsoMinute li.)      assume certain functions, on  the understanding that  a fullsettlement of all aspects of the Ethiopian question could only bemade at the Peace Conference.Points made in discussion :  (1) The Foreign Secretary, while prepared to accept thisproposal for the present, thought that it would bedifficult to maintain it for long, and that the position might be difficult vis-a-vis the Emperor.(2) The Secretary of State for the Colonies emphasised the dangers of reaction on negro opinion in the West indies and West Africa if we appeared to be treating theEmperor harshly.(3) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thatGeneral Smuts&apos;s attitude in January had been that asettlement of the Abyssinian question should be left tothe Peace Conference, and should not be prejudiced inthe meantime (Telegram No. 83 from United kingdom high Commissioner).(4) The Lord Privy Seal attached importance to the point ofview that the Emperor had been the first of many rulerswho had been wrongfully deprived of his territory, andwas the first to be restored. The integrity of this position should not be qualified.(5) The Prime Minister said that our aim should be (a) - to complete the defeat of the Italian forces and to capture the Duke of Aosta;(&amp;) to prevent a massacre of the Italians;(c) to remove as many as possible of our troops for useelsewhere; and(d) to hand over Ethiopia to its rulers as a Native State.There was no need for us to concern ourselvesunduly as to how it was governed.(6) The Financial Secretary to the War Office emphasised theimportance of sending instructions to General Wavellwhich would let him know the extent of his responsibility. He mentioned that the Emperor had recently appointed seven Ministers, and it was not known whether they would be regarded as acceptable bythe people of Abyssinia.Discussion turned on the draft telegram to General Wavell,set out as an Appendix to the Paper, and the following amendments were suggested  Paragraph 1 should be re-drafted as follows : &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government welcome the reappear-ance of an independent Ethiopian State, but for thepresent the conduct of military operations requires thatthe Emperor must abide strictly by the advice of theBritish military authorities.&quot;Paragraph 2 should read as follows : &quot;Ethiopia is temporarily under British militaryguidance and control, pending a further decision by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.&quot;
