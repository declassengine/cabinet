Italian-East .Africa.Italian civilians in Ethiopia.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 40thConclusions,Minute 1.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (G) (41) 42) stating that theBritish military authorities in East Africa were concerned aboutthe 40,000 Italian civilians concentrated in Addis Ababa. Whenthe Emperor entered the capital, the Italians might: lose, theirheads and we might find it diffioult to prevent their beingmassacred by the Ethiopians. The Governments of! Kenya aridSouthern Rhodesia could take a relatively small number ofItalians. General Smuts, however, was doubtful of the wisdom of taking Italian civilians into the Union, and had suggested thatthe Italian Government should be approached and told that wewould allow Italian ships, under a British safe conduct, to be usedto evacuate Italian civilians from Ethiopia.In discussion it was pointed out that we could not allowItalian ships to pass through the Suez Canal, to remove them by sea via the Cape was at best a long-term project. It looked,therefore, as though arrangements would have to be made toretain a large number of Italian civilians in Ethiopia. Thesuggestion was made that some of them might be moved toEritrea.It was urged that although the Italian&apos; Government were unlikely to accept General Smuts&apos; suggestion, there might never-theless be some advantage in putting the proposal to them.The Prime Minister thought it would be necessary to examinethe proposal carefully &quot;when hV&quot;had been drafted, to make surewe were not putting forward a derisory suggestion.The War Cabinet :-Took note of these views and invited the Foreign Secre-tary to draft a telegram on the lines of General Smuts&apos;:proposal for submission to the Prime Minister.France.French Terri--\,rial Waters(PreviousReference9.   The First Lord of the Admiralty asked authority to issue instructions that, as French territory could not be regarded inpresent circumstances as having the status of an ordinary neutral,all French territorial waters (other than those on the China.Station or in American waters) might be entered for the purposeWmTii) 22nd Q^ attacking or intercepting enemy shipping.   For the purpose of conclusions      intercepting French merchant shipping, the territorial waters of minute 3)&apos;      Madagascar, Reunion, and all French territories on the australian and New Zealand Station, and all French African territories,might be entered.The War Cabinet approved the issue of instructions onthe lines proposed.Great George Street, S.W. 1,April 24, 1941.
