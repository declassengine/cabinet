The Prime Minister said that, after the discussion at thelast Meeting of the War Cabinet, he had come to the conclusion thatthe best plan would be to include in the statement which he was proposing to make that morning in the House, on the naval battleand on the fighting in Crete, a short statement on the following lines: He would refer to the answer which he had given in theHouse on the 20th May that this question had for some time pastengaged the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government and that he hoped to make a statement about it in the present week; he would say that various enquiries had been made, and that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had now come to the conclusion that, although there could be no dispute about our rights, or about the merits, it wouldbe more trouble than it was worth to apply conscription to NorthernIreland.While he regretted that it should be necessary to reach this conclusion, he felt that it was best to dispose of the matter inthis way.The War Cabinet-Approved the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion to deal with thematter on these lines.Clothing. 3.
