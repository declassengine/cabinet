In these operations we had lost 4 aircraft of the bomber command and 5 or 6 of the Coastal Command.Reports from foreign sources showed that the attack on Berlinon the night of the 17th/18th April had been the most successfulwe had so far made.In reply to a question The Chief of the Air Staff said that inhis view our bombers, were flying too low over Germany. He wasissuing orders to deal with this.Shipping casualties since the 17th April had been : Ships lost-By aircraft: 2 ships by mine : 1 ship    .........By E-boat: .2 ships.........To these must be added belatedreports of ships sunk   ...about 7,000 tons.about 24,000 tons.about 31,000 tons.Ships damaged-By submarine: 1 ship       ...By aircraft: 2 ships       ...      ...By E-boat: 1 ship ...      ...      ...

(41)-4*8*.Conclusions,Minute 4.)Spain.(previous reference::W.M. (41) 41stConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Foreign Secretary thought that we should try to openup discussions with the Soviet Union, although he was not verysanguine of good results. He had &quot;had a preliminary talk withM. Maisky (Telegram 365 to Moscow). At the same time, sir stafford Cripps had been having a discussion with M. Vishinsky(Telegrams 380 and 381 from Moscow), the results of which must now be awaited. But it seemed that the Soviet Government stillregarded the Baltic States as the main stumbling-block between us.He (the Foreign Secretary) thought that we should make no con-cessions on Baltic States questions unless we received somethingdefinite in return. We should not make a concession to put theSoviet in a good humour with us, in hopes that something mightemerge.The Foreign Secretary reminded the War Cabinet that somesix weeks earlier Lord Halifax had mentioned to Mr. Hull thepossibility of a joint declaration by the United States, the dutch and ourselves that we would not tolerate continued Japanese south-ward aggression. The declaration might be made privately to theJapanese Government. He proposed to ask our Ambassador toraise this matter again with the United States Government.Mr. Menzies said that the Commonwealth government attached the greatest possible importance to the stabilising effect ofsuch a declaration. He had already telegraphed to the AustralianMinister at Washington asking him to support this suggestion.The Foreign Secretary thought that there was no further actionwhich we could take at the moment in regard to the situation in spain. The United States Ambassador at Madrid had had a rather stormy interview with Senor Suner, but the news of it mightnot reach General Franco. The Spanish Government were likelyto be influenced by the course of events in Egypt and Libya.Turkey. The Foreign Secretary had seen the Turkish Ambassador, who(Previous spoke as though Turkey expected to be next on the list of the PowersReference: to !be attacked, irrespective of the immediate military developmentsW.M.

(41) 22ndConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (41) 89) asking that the &quot; sinkat sight &quot; zone in the Mediterranean should be extended to includethe whole of the Adriatic and the Aegean, except Turkish territorial waters, and that the eastern limit of the area should be extended toa line joining Cape Kahelidonia, in Turkey, to Ras-el-Kanais inEgypt.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that German ships hadalready passed the Dardanelles and proceeded to Salonika. In viewof the extreme urgency of the matter he had, with the concurrence of the Foreign Secretary, put this proposal into effect, pendingcovering approval by the War Cabinet. Prior intimation of our action had been given to the Russian and Turkish Governments.The War Cabinet :-Approved the proposals regarding the extension of the&quot; sink at sight zone in the Mediterranean, contained in w.P. (41) 89.Oil.100 OctaneFuel: Comple-tion of theThornton Plant.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 284ttConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Aircraft Production (W.P. (41) 80) pointing out thatthe position had materially altered since the War Cabinet had decided in November, 1940, to complete the erection of the Thorntonplant.   He thought that the decision should now be reversed.This view met with general agreement. The Minister ofLabour, who attached importance to maintaining refinery capacity in operation in this country, dissented. It was pointed out that theimportation of refined fuel would save shipping capacity to theextent of about 15 per cent. It was, however, essential to make sure that capacity in the United States would be able to supply theAir Ministry requirements of 100 octane fuel in 1941 and 1943when they would be very large.The War Cabinet:-Agreed that enquiry should be made in the United states to make sure that sufficient capacity would be available and could be put at our disposal to meet R.A.F. require-ments of 100 octane fuel in 1942 and 1943. Subject to this the work of completing the Thornton plant should be discontinued^Great George Street, S.W-1.,April 21, 1941.
