The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 663-666 :-Summary of Aircraft Losses since the 27th June :-Home Theatre-Enemy 22 destroyed.11 probable.18 damaged.Our Own 15 fighters (2 pilots safe).32 bombers.8 Coastal Command.Overseas Theatre Enemy 35 destroyed.4 probable.29 damaged (28 on the ground).Our Own 6 destroyed.1 damaged.The heavy losses in bombers on the nights of the 28th and29th June had been due to phenomenal light conditions.The Prime Minister said that our attacks must continue. Butthe Chief of the Air Staff might inform the Commander-in-Chief,Bomber Command, that he had liberty to instruct our bombers to turn back if altogether exceptional weather conditions prevailed.That day six heavy bombers had made a daylight raid on Kieland Hamburg.Bomber Command aircraft had sunk two ships out of an enemyconvoy in the English Channel. This brought the total of ships sunk by Bomber Command since the 12th March to 100.During the previous four days seven ships had been sunk bysubmarines and three by aircraft, totalling 60,000 tons. Shippingtotalling 44,000 tons had been damaged.Details were given of the protection afforded to the convoywhich had left Halifax on the 16th June. Attacks on this convoyby U-boats over a period of several days had resulted in our losingfive ships, two others being damaged. We had, however, sunk two-boats definitely and probably a third.       jA U-boat had been sunk off Gibraltar, and two Italian and oneFrench submarine had been sunk in the Mediterranean.Palmyra had now been completely surrounded.    further reinforcements were being sent to Syria.Authentic news was scarce. But it looked as though theRussian forces had been concentrated too far forward and had beentaken by surprise.Worth of the Pripet Marshes. It seemed that the germans had broken through on a wide front, both in Nbrth-East poland and in Lithuania, and that the main weight of their mobileformations had reached the general line Minsk-Vilna.Another German drive was developing on the front Vilna-Dvinsk.South of the Pripet Marshes. There had been hardfighting in the Luck-Lwbw sector and the Germans appearedto have achieved a break-through.In this sector the German aim might be to turn the line ofDniester.The Russian military position appeared to be very grave,although German air and land losses nad been considerable.[22673]

(41) 148) as to the functions of the Minister of State for theMiddle East, were handed round.The Prime Minister hoped that the appointment would affordconsiderable relief to the Commanders-in-Chief and would enable:them to concentrate to a far greater degree on the operational sideof their work. The Prime Minister of New Zealand had been made aware of this proposal, which had also been communicated to thePrime Ministers of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Unionof South Africa.In discussion on the organisation in the Middle East, thePrime Minister said that General Haining (the Intendant-General)had asked for executive powers in regard to Army servicing and repairs. Air Vice-Marshal Dawson was examining the aircraftrepair and servicing organisation.Mr. Harriman was also in the Middle East, largely with theobject of satisfying himself that proper arrangements existed for taking over the large supplies of American material now arriving in the Middle East.Mr. Fraser mentioned certain apparent defects in our organi-sation which had come to his notice while in the Middle East.The Prime Minister said that it would be very helpful if mr. Fraser could put on paper the impressions he had formed. this paper might either be communicated to him (the Prime Minister)or circulated to the War Cabinet.The Prime Minister also informed the War Cabinet that, as  minister of Defence, he had decided on an exchange of dutiesbetween General Wavell and General Auchinleck. Copies of the telegrams in regard to this change were being circulated to the WarCabinet.*The War Cabinet were informed that these changes would notbe made public for another two days.The War Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the above arrangements.3. A discussion took place, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that itwas of the utmost importance that the operations in Syria shouldbe brought to a conclusion as early as possible. The delay was having an unhappy effect on other countries.It seemed that the Vichy Government had tried unsuccessfullyto get the consent of the Turkish Government to allow men and munitions to pass through their territory, en route to Syria.Another Vichy intermediary had asked His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Angora on what terms we should be prepared to agree to the cessation of hostilities in Syria.The War Cabinet authorised the Foreign Secretary :-(i) To telegraph to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors in Angoraand Cairo the terms for a cessation of hostilities in Syria which had already been approved(ii) To instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Angorato communicate those terms to the Vichy Govern-ment&apos;s intermediary, as soon as he was informed by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo that the commanders-in-CMef in the Middle East andGeneral de Gaulle saw no objection to this course..

(ForeignW.M. (41) 6lst   Office Telegram to Angora, No. 1458.)Conclusions, The Foreign Secretary said that he had it in mind to proposeMinute 2.) an exchange of notes with the Turkish Government. We might(a) undertake not to do a deal at Turkey&apos;s expense; (6) give guarantees of our intention to respect Turkey&apos;s territorial integrity; and (c) say that the Anglo-Turkish Treaty of October1939 remained the foundation of our policy vis-a-vis Turkey. TheTurkish Government, for their part, might be persuaded to saythat they regarded the Anglo-Turkish Treaty as the foundation of their foreign policy, and that they would refrain from actioninimical to our interests.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to propose an exchangeof notes with the Turkish Government on the above lines.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatM. Maisky had asked him what was in the mind of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment regarding military, economic and political collabora-tion with Russia. He had assured M. Maisky that we were withthem up to the hilt in all military and economic measures for the defeat of Germany. As regards political collaboration, he had asked what M. Maisky had in mind. The latter had replied thathe had in mind our respective policies in those parts of the worldwhere we both had interests, e.g., the Middle East and the Far East.He (the Foreign Secretary) had said that he saw no difficulty in an exchange of views on these matters.The War Cabinet approved the line taken by the foreign secretary. *f7.   The War Cabinet had before them the following further)ers on this matter : A Memorandum by the Minister of Information(W.P. (41) 139).A Memorandum by the Prime Minister, setting out certain points which emerged from the discussion at the War Cabineton Monday, 23rd June (W.P. (41) 142).A Memorandum by Lord Beaverbrook commenting on this paper (W.P. (41) 147).The Minister of Information made a statement amplifying thepoints set out in his Memorandum. In his view there was need fora strong Central Propaganda Department, equipped with adequatepowers to overcome the weaknesses inherent in the present arrangements. Yet the present proposals would leave the ministry in a weaker position.The Minister of Supply supported the view taken by theMinister of Information, and said that the country required a freerflow of news. The proposals he had made had been aimed at bringing into existence an authoritative body which could give directions for propaganda in its various forms and could co-ordinate a propaganda campaign.U.S.S.R.(previous references:W.M (41) 62ndConclusions,Minutes 4and 5.)Information and propaganda.

The War Cabinet had before them the following furtherPropaganda.      Papers on this matter : (Previous A   Memorancmm   by   the   Minister   of   InformationwTwYM A (W-P- (41) 139)-w. .). &apos;      - A Memorandum by the Prime Minister, setting out certainone conclusions, points which emerged from the discussion at the War cabinet minute b.) on Mondayj 23rd June (W.P. (41) 142).A Memorandum by Lord Beaverbrook commenting on this paper (W.P. (41) 147).The Minister of Information made a statement amplifying thepoints set out in his Memorandum. In his view there was need fora strong Central Propaganda Department, equipped with adequatepowers to overcome the weaknesses inherent in the present arrangements. Yet the present proposals would leave the ministry in a weaker position.The Minister of Supply supported the view taken by theMinister of Information, and said that the country required a freerflow of news. The proposals he had made had been aimed at bringing into existence an authoritative body which could give directions for propaganda in its various forms and could co-ordinate a propaganda campaign.
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs also thought thatthe scheme set out in the Prime Minister&apos;s Paper did not give theMinister of Information sufficient powers.The other Ministers present expressed general agreement withthe scheme set out in the Prime Ministers Paper.The following were the main points dealt with in discussion : Pablie Relations Officers.The Prime Minister said that it was impossible to uprootfrom the Departments the organisation of DepartmentalPublicity Officers which had grown up to meet a real need. Itwas essential, however, that the Public Relations Officers of departments should meet together daily under the chairman-ship of the Minister of Information. These officers would not,of course, be under the orders of the Minister of information in the same sense that they were under the orders of their departmental Ministers. But it would be their duty to work together with the Minister as members of a team. In his view,the real function of the Ministry lay in co-ordinating the workof these Publicity Officers so as to ensure a single consistentpropaganda policy, and in bringing about a constant flow ofgood and interesting speeches.Operational Communiques.The general view was that the Ministry of information could not be given discretion to alter the terms of a communique (to be issued as such) which had been settled bythe Service Ministries or, e.g., by the Commander-in-Chief,Middle East. This, however, did not prevent the Ministry ofInformation from using the material in those Communiques tocompile a single record of the day&apos;s happenings, as was atpresent done in the Empire Service, provided that that recorddid not purport to be a Communique issued by the service ministries.Foreign Propaganda.It was part of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s functions to give directions, as often as might be necessary, as to the policy to beadopted on any particular issue of foreign politics. Theexecution of this policy should be left to the Ministry of Infor-mation. That Ministry should be informed beforehand if theForeign Secretary intended to see representatives of the Press,and should have an opportunity of advising as to the arrange-ments to be made, and of having a representative present atthe Meeting.British Council.This had not been dealt with in the Prime Minister&apos;s paper because general agreement had been expressed with thesecond suggestion in Lord Beaverbrook&apos;s previous Paper(W.P. (41) 137), namely, that the functions of the council should be divided propaganda activities of the Council fallingunder the Ministry of Information, while the educational andstrictly cultural activities would remain with the Council.:Films.It was argued, that the sentence in paragraph 7 of thePrime Minister&apos;s Memorandum as to films would leave it free to any Department to make its own film independently of theMinistry of Information.
zmThe Prime Minister said that this was certainly not theintention of his paper. The bias should be in favour of all filmsbeing done under the Ministry of Information. Where,however, a film was being made which involved the use of, forexample, large bodies of troops or ships, it was clearly necessarythat the arrangements for making the film should be carriedout with the full co-operation of the Department primarily concerned.% The War Cabinet-(1) Gave general approval, in principle, to the scheme set outin the Prime Minister&apos;s Memorandum (W.P. (41) 142).(2) Invited the Prime Minister, in consultation with the lord president of the Council, to consider to what extent theterms of the Memorandum could be modified or amplifiedso as to remove points of doubt raised in discussion, anyverbal amendments being sent to the Secretary as early as possible.(3) Agreed that the Prime Ministers Paper, as so amended,should be taken as the basis for the statements of Govern-ment policy to be made in Parliament on Thursday, the3rd July.8.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (G) (41) 62).Hie Home Secretary said that this matter had been consideredby the Civil Defence Executive Sub-Committee that morning, who&quot;had reached the following conclusions : (a) There was no sufficient case for discontinuing horse-racingaltogether.(b) The possibility should be explored of restricting racemeetings to Saturday afternoons.(c) If it were desired to go further, a Defence Regulation mightbe made under which the police would have power to close the vicinity of race courses to all motorists except those who could show that they had legitimate businessthere. The difficulty of discriminating, however, betweenhorse-racing and other forms of recreation should beborne in mind in considering this proposal.(d) The Minister of Labour might be invited to considerapproaching the Joint Consultative Committee ofEmployers and Trade Unions for their advice on thissubject.The Minister of War Transport said that he would like toreduce the number of extra trains run in connection with races afterSeptember. At the present time it was stated publicly that no additional facilities would be provided, but in practice a numberof relief trains were run. He also hoped that no races would be heldon certain courses, e.g., Newbury, which were situated on railway lines on which there was great pressure.The Prime Minister strongly deprecated any attempt to puta stop to horse-racing, but welcomed an attempt to prevent are currence of large assemblies of motor-cars, such as had attended the recent Derby Meeting at Newmarket.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that on^or two Members of Parliament had commented on the crowdsattending football matches. He thought that it would tend tobring about a very unhealthy state of affairs, if an attempt wasHorse-racing,War-timearrangements.
made to put a stop to football matches. This met with generalagreement.The War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) Horse-racing should not be discontinued.  An effort shouldbe made to carry it on in a restricted form.(2) The possibility should be explored of restricting RaceMeetings to Saturday afternoons.(3) Race Meetings should not be held on courses which involvedinterference with railway traffic on congested lines.(4) Such steps as might be found practicable should be takento prevent large assemblies of motor-cars  at racemeetings.Great George Street, S.W. 1,June 30, 1941.
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC t/I A JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET. Copy No.[N 3304/29/G]Mr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps (Moscotv).(No. 101.)Sir, Foreign Office, June 30, 1941.THE Soviet Ambassador came to see me this afternoon, when he said thathe was very glad that we had acted so promptly in the despatch of our missionsto Moscow. This was in sharp contrast to his experiences two years ago when our mission had gone by slow stages by sea. His Government were grateful forour prompt action. At the same time the mere fact that the missions had beensent off so hurriedly increased the need for a definition of their scope. He thoughtthat at present our missions had perhaps too little authority. They askedquestions as to the Russian dispositions and other matters in connexion with russian activity in the war, but when asked about our plans and any action we proposed to take, they said that they had to refer home. The Soviet Governmentdesired to secure a definition of the collaboration which we visualised. Did we intend that it should be military only, or military and economic, or military,economic and political ? The Ambassador said his impression was that hisGovernment were ready for all three, but they would like to know what we under-stood by the term collaboration.2. I said that, so far as military and economic matters were concerned, i thought the position had already been made clear in the Prime Minister&apos;s broad-cast and in my own speech in the House of Commons. We would give all themilitary and economic help in our power in order to defeat the common enemy.The limit in these spheres was the possible. Political collaboration, however, wasa more difficult problem. What in the Ambassadors view did his Governmentmean by that phrase? Had they in mind an alliance or some less far-reachingarrangement ? M. Maisky replied that he thought that what his government wished to know was whether we were willing to discuss our respective policies in those parts of the world where we both had interests, for example, the middle east and the Far East. I replied that I saw no difficulty in such an exchange of views. Indeed, I had myself some time ago, even before the German invasion ofRussia, asked the Ambassador if his Government could tell me what their views were in respect of the Middle East. The Ambassador replied that he clearlyrecollected this. I undertook to raise this question at the Cabinet and to report further to the Ambassador. In the meanwhile he expressed himself as muchgratified by the definition I had given him in respect of military and economiccollaboration.3. The Ambassador then put to me certain questions about our plans forthe provision of military and naval help. Was there not some further action wecould take than the air raids on France by day ? I said that I had seen a telegramfrom your Excellency which had been somewhat corrupt, but from which itappeared that in a conversation with some Minister here, I presumed myself, theMinister concerned had suggested the possibility of our giving naval help ateither Petsamo or Murmansk. I had never made any such suggestion and Iwondered what the Ambassador had in mind. M. Maisky said at once that itwas quite true that I had never discussed this matter with him, but, in point of fact, Lord Beavex^brook had made this suggestion during a luncheon that theyhad had together on Friday, and he had passed it on to his Government. He (the ambassador) could only speak personally, but he wondered whether there was notsome naval action we could take which would prevent the Germans from staginga joint sea and land operation against Murmansk. I said I had no information on this subject, but I imagined that such an operation would present considerabletechnical difficulties for us. I would, however, report his observations to ourauthorities who dealt with such matters. The Ambassador urged strongly that10916-108   [22665-1]

The Ambassador urged strongly that10916-108   [22665--1]
We should do all we could in the course of the next week or two to press the Germans in the West by all means in our power. Could we not make air raids on Germany by day ? In reply to this, I mentioned the difficulty of affording thenecessary fighter protection. Could we not make further raids such as that onthe Lofoten Islands, which he had been told had caused great perturbation inGermany and resulted in the Germans keeping two divisions in the neighbour-hood for ten days ? Could we not make raids on France which involved landingsof troops, particularly on such areas as Britanny, where the destruction of the atlantic bases would be of great value to us? His information was that theGermans had greatly weakened their air force in France and in the Westgenerally, and any action of this kind that we could take would be muchappreciated by the Soviets.4. Finally, the Ambassador said that his Government felt some anxietyowing to the delay which was taking place in finally dealing with the situation in syria. If we could clear this up, the effect on Turkey would be very good.I am, &amp;c.ANTHONY EDEN.
