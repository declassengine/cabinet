Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 51stConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.Crete.MilitaryOperations.Crete.Syria.1. The Chiefs of Staff made the following reports in amplification-cation of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 625-627 : Summary of aircraft losses since the 19th May : Home Theatre Enemy 11 destroyed.9 damaged.Our own- 12 Fighters (3 pilots safe).2 Bombers.One Bomber and 6 Fighters had been lost in an attack theprevious day on an oil refinery near Bethune, in the course of whichwe had destroyed 5 and damaged 8 enemy fighters.A considerable number of our aircraft had been damagedrecently on the ground in attacks on Western aerodromes. TheChief of the Air Staff was asked to report on this matter.Overseas Theatre -Enemy 7 destroyed.2 damaged.Our own 12 destroyed.18 damaged.The recent lull in night raids on this country was probably due partly to the over-working of the German pilots during the moonperiod, and partly to the bad weather.A signal had been received that a convoy of 30 enemy ships hadbeen sighted 12 miles South of Melo, and that some of our destroyers were attempting to engage it, but no further news had been received.On the previous night our destroyers had engaged a convoy north of Canea Bay and had sunk one Italian destroyer, two merchant ships and a number of caiques.The enemy had made lodgments at different points, but, it was believed, had not obtained control over any large areas, and had suffered heavy casualties in the process. Little definite news was available owing to the destruction of cyphers on security grounds.Our losses so far had been light. No sea-borne landing had yet beenreported.The latest reports from General Wavell indicated that theprospects of a Free French success in Syria were much less favourable than previous estimates. General Wavell was discussing the situation with General Catroux, and would telegraph his plans.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Portugal.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 295thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that thePortuguese Ambassador had just returned from Lisbon and had reported the results of his discussions with Senhor Salazar. He had raised certain points which called for an early reply.The War Cabinet agreed that the points raised should bediscussed at an early meeting of the Defence Committee.The Portuguese Ambassador had said that opinion in Portugalwas that the recent changes in the Spanish Government did notfundamentally change the attitude which that Government was likely to adopt in the face of strong demands by Germany.[22543]
Conscription.Application to. NorthernIreland.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 51stConclusions,Minute 7.)(previous reference:W.M. (41) 38thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theMinister of Labour and National Service, and the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (41) 107 and 108).The Prime Minister said that he had seen Mr. Dulanty that morning. Mr. Dulanty had used the usual arguments, and had saidthat the application of conscription to Northern Ireland might beexpected to lead to trouble, or even to bloodshed. He had alsoargued that, since most of the Protestants in Northern Ireland wereserving in the Home Guard, conscription would, in fact, apply toCatholics only. He (the Prime Minister) had said that this was amisapprehension, since conscription would be applied to thoseserving in the Home Guard.Mr. Dulanty had then enumerated the various ways in whichIreland was giving help to this country, including the facilities forthe civil flying-boats at Foynes. He had, however, made it clearthat the mention of these facilities was not intended as a threat oftheir withdrawal if conscription was applied to Northern Ireland.The Prime Minister said that he had also indicated toMr. Dulanty that the feeling in this country about the attitude ofSouthern Ireland was very hard and bitter, and that, if that attitude was persisted in, it would lead to a permanent embitterment of feeling after the war. He had promised to report what Mr. Dulantyhad said to the War Cabinet, but he had not led him to think thatthe War Cabinet would be much influenced by these representations.Points made in discussion : (1) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that thepeople of Ireland, as a whole, did not know that we had told Mr. de Valera that if Ireland would abandon her neutrality we were ready to share our Air Defenceswith her.The Prime Minister said that, if it was finally decided to introduce conscription in Northern Ireland,this and other broad issues in the Irish situation mightwell find a place in a speech on the Bill.(2) It was generally felt that the scheme would have a much better chance of success if its administration was taken out of the hands of the Northern Ireland Governmentand its Departments and was entrusted to a branch ofthe National Service Department of the Ministry ofLabour. This would have to be discussed with theNorthern Ireland Government.(3) The Home Secretary read to the War Cabinet the full text of a telegram received from the Northern ireland government, which read as follows : &apos;&apos; The Government of Northern Ireland is emphati-cally of opinion that conscription should be applied to northern Ireland. It considers that in this mattercommon basis for whole of the United Kingdom is just.It further considers, particularly in the light of recentheavy enemy attacks, that principle of equality ofsacrifice and service (one group undecypherable)conscription is essential to promote degree of corporatediscipline which is necessary if our people are to withstand the tide of total war and play their full partin the national effort. The Government of NorthernIreland consider that there may be nationalist opposi-tion to conscription. It is impossible to forecast theextent of such opposition accurately. It feels, however,that difficulties of such opposition would be more than offset by the advantages gained.&quot;
(4) What degree of opposition was likely? There were about,000 members of the I.R.A. in Northern Ireland, butthey were much less formidable than a few years earlier.(5) One of the most serious forms of resistance to conscriptionwould be wholesale refusal to register, and this might happen if ordered by the Catholic Church and theNationalist Societies.(6) It would be a serious matter if disorder affected the aircraft and shipping establishments in Northern Ireland.The War Cabinet-(a) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security to ask the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland to come over for a meeting with the Prime Minister, the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Labour on the following morning.(b) Agreed that the administration of conscription in NorthernIreland should, if possible, be entrusted to a branch ofthe National Service Department of the Ministry ofLabour. This matter should be discussed with represen-tatives of the Northern Ireland Government, and itmight be desirable to invite other representatives ofthe Northern Ireland Government to accompanyMr. Andrews for this purpose.(c) Invited the Home Secretary to take discreet soundings inother quarters as to the probable reactions to the appli-cation of conscription to Northern Ireland.(d) Agreed to defer a final decision on this matter to their meeting on Monday, the 26th May.TheGovernment.JuniorMinisterialAppointments.(previous reference :W.M. (41) 13thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Prime Minister said that two holders of JuniorMinisterial appointments, 38 and 39 years of age, had recentlybeen registered under the Military Service Acts. Ministerialappointments were not specifically covered by the Schedule of reserved Occupations, and a decision was therefore required inthese two cases.The Prime Minister said that he had decided that, in presentcircumstances, it would be contrary to the public interest that the holders of Junior Ministerial appointments should leave such employment for the Army, and he had instructed the Minister ofLabour and National Service to act accordingly.The War Cabinet expressed their general approval of thiscourse.Great George Street, S.W. 1,May 22, 1941.
