The Chiefs of Staff made the following reports in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records 555-557.Our measures against enemy night bombing had been increasingly effective.In December we had destroyed one bomber in every 326 whichhad come over.In January one in every 110.In February one in every 95.In March (first 12 days) one in 63.It was agreed that these figures could not be published.Bomber Command had despatched 255 aircraft the previous night to attack targets in Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, Boulogne andCalais. The targets hit included the railway stations in Berlin, theSubmarine Yard at Hamburg and the Fokker Wulfe factory atBremen.The casualties for the previous night&apos;s operations had been Our own- 7 missing.2 crashed on landing.Enemy 1 fighter shot down over Germany.2 fighter? ) destroyed over this country.6 probably destroyed.8 damaged.In Malta some aircraft had been destroyed on the ground. Inthe Middle East, since the last report to the War Cabinet, we had lost one aircraft and destroyed 13 enemy aircraft.A report had been received that two ships were being attacked by a warship raider in the Atlantic.Since the last report to the War Cabinet, one vessel of about,000 tons had been sunk off the East Coast by an E-boat; some27,000 tons of shipping had been damaged by aircraft attacks onconvoys, and 2 ships had been damaged and 2 sunk in the air raidon the Manchester Ship Canal on the night of the 11th March.Two Norwegian whalers in prize proceeding to enemy-occupied territory had scuttled themselves off the Bay of Biscay on inter-ception by our forces.Our troops had occupied Daghabur (100 miles south of Jijigaon the Mogadishu-Harar Road) on the 10th March. The enemy losses since our crossing of the Juba River on the 17th Februarywere put at 31,000.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Balkans 2.

The casualties in Liverpool were not yet known.

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theAmerica.

We should now soonMinute 7.)       receive immeasurable benefits under the Lease and Lend Act.It was unfortunate that the United States authorities wishedto have their rights set down in such precise legal terms. He wouldhave preferred that the matter should be dealt with onyinore general lines. / tIt could be argued that in certain hypothetical events the termsof the Agreement would have very awkward consequences for us.But, if the matter was looked at from the point of view of thecountries with which the United States was likely to be involved inwar, the position was not nearly so alarming.The First Sea Lord said that the amendment proposed to article II had been put forward because the Chiefs of Staff felt!
Chemical 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theWarfare. Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security in regard toPublicity for     publicity for anti-gas measures (W.P. (41) 52).Precautionary Discussion turned mainly on the question whether the draftmeasures. Parliamentary Statement should include a threat of retaliation.(Previous The Minister favoured this course,  on  the ground that any reference: Parliamentary Statement on the subject would be incompleteW.M. (41) 22nd without it; and that the Government were likely to be pressed as conclusions, to their intentions on this matter. It was also argued that a minute 6.) statement that we would retaliate might well have a deterrent effecton the enemy.Against this it was argued that the enemy must be well aware that we should retaliate. Any statement that we should retaliatewould, however, be judged by the Germans as an indication thatwe intended to take the initiative in using gas, and might thereforeprovoke Germany to embark on this course.After individual members of the War Cabinet had expressed their views, the Prime Minister said that the weight of opinion was against the inclusion of any threat of retaliation in the Statementof Policy.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the Statement of Policy appended to the HomeSecretary&apos;s Memorandum, and agreed that it should not include any reference to retaliatory measures.(6) Approved the further anti-gas measures contained in theMemorandum.(c) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security to use his discretion regarding the date upon which thepublic declaration should be made.that if either nation was involved in war, that nation should be ableto take any action requisite for defence in the neighbouringterritory.The Prime Minister said that in principle he agreed entirely with the Chiefs of Staffs aovice. But in practice he doubted whether the point was of great importance, or whether we could obtain an amendment in the sense desired. The strategic value ofthese bases was that they could be used by some other Power for attack on the United States. So long as the United States werein occupation of the leased areas there was no danger that theywould permit the bases or the neighbouring British territories to be occupied by any third nation.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to concludethe Agreement on the basis of the draft of Articles Iand II set out in Annex &quot; A &quot; to W.P. (41) 57, subjectto such further amendment as he might be able to secure.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to consult President Rooseveltas to when the Agreement should be published.(3) Took note that thereafter it would probably be necessaryto invite Parliament to endorse the Agreement; and agreed that every endeavour should be made to securethat such endorsement was unanimous.(4) Invited the Minister of Information to take suitable action with the Press, when the agreement was published.
Home Defence.Instructions tothe Public.(previous references:W.M. (40) 213thConclusions,Minute 10, andW.M. (41) 14thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The &quot;War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (G.) (41) 33), containing thedraft of a leaflet containing instructions for the general public inthe event of invasion.The War Cabinet-(a) Invited the Prime Minister to redraft the introductoryparagraph (which would appear above his initials) to theleaflet.(b) Approved the remainder of the leaflet subject to the deletionof paragraph 14.Shipping.Replacement ofBritish andand AlliedTonnage.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 23rdConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Shipping (W.P. (G.) (41) 32). The main proposals inthis Paper were as follows : (a) The governing principle suggested was that each of theAllied countries should have, at the end of the war,about the same proportion of total tonnage as they hadpossessed on the outbreak of war.(b) About one-quarter of the building facilities available tous in 1941, including those in the U.S.A., should be allocated to our Allies, plus a suitable allocation of second-hand ships.(c) Authority should  be given  for the sale,  at cost, ofGovernment-built ships to United Kingdom owners who wished to buy them in replacement of vessels lost duringthe war.The Minister of Shipping said that unless he could make a concession on the lines proposed to our Allies, he would not be ableto conclude satisfactory negotiations with the Norwegians or the greeks to give us control of very considerable quantities of norwegian and Greek tonnage.If proposals (a) and (b) were agreed to, it would be essential toagree to the sale at cost of Government-built ships to UnitedKingdom owners, in replacement of vessels lost during the war.Considerable pressure was being exercised on him to agree to thi&amp;course.Discussion turned mainly on the proposal (c), in regard towhich the following points were urged : (1) To allow United Kingdom owners to buy Government-builtships would involve preferential treatment to ship-owners. Many people had had their businessesdestroyed, and had been promised compensation, but could not restore their property until after the war.Again, no specific undertaking of compensation had beengiven in respect of firms which would be adversely affected, by the scheme for the concentration ofproduction, although it was part of that scheme that allpossible consideration should be extended to such firmsafter the war.(2) On the other hand, if part of a factory essential for war purposes was destroyed, e.g., an aircraft factory, it wasrebuilt at Government expense.(3) If shipowners could not replace the ships lost, theirbusinesses might suffer owing to the overheads beingspread over a smaller fleet. In reply it was pointed outthat many shipping firms were given the management ofGovernment-built ships.
(4) For the Government to build a ship and sell it at cost price to a commercial firm, and then to requisition it at once,appeared on the face of it to be a peculiar transaction.Whereas the Government paid 1\ per cent, on the moneyborrowed to build ships, the Government paid 5 per cent,on the capital value of requisitioned ships privately owned. It was generally agreed that it would be indefensible that the sale of Government-built ships should be allowed to result in increased running charges.(5) It had been urged on behalf of the shipowners that therewas no inducement for them to get ships to sea unless theships were their own property. This argument was not easy to follow, but the fact that the point had been raised would be likely to give rise to parliamentary criticism.(6) Again, if the ships were built for private owners, it might make it more difficult to switch labour from ship-building to ship repairing. Generally, private ownership was likely to make for more delays thanGovernment ownership in the handling of ships.(7) If private owners were allowed to place orders for ships,they might stipulate for special features or types whichwould not be best suited for war needs.Summing up, the Prime Minister said that nothing must bedone which would impede the full liberty of the Government toarrange for the construction of the types of ships best suited forwar needs, or which would lead to delay. He sympathised, however,with the shipping lines which had lost a number of ships, and wished for some assurance that those losses would, so far aspossible, be replaced, so as to enable the firms to continue in businessafter the war. This country had profited considerably by the enterprise of shipping firms. He saw no reason why an arrange-ment to earmark particular Government-built ships for transfer to private ownership at the end of the war in replacement of lossesshould result in the firms concerned receiving any more favourablefinancial terms in respect of those ships than if the ships remained in the Government ownership until the end of the war. The sort ofarrangement he had in mind was one whereby ships wereprovisionally allocated for transfer to private firms in replacement of losses, but the transfer of ownership was put into cold storageuntil the date determined as the official end of war.A solution on these lines would not prejudge any question of change in our social structure after the war. If the issue of nationalisation was raised, it should be raised on its merits as ageneral issue, and not in regard to a single industry.The War Cabinet (1) Agreed generally that the question of the sale ofGovernment-owned ships to United Kingdom owners in replacement of vessels lost during the war should besettled on the lines indicated generally by the PrimeMinister.(2) Remitted to the Lord Presidents Committee (with theaddition of the First Lord of the Admiralty and theMinister of Shipping) the task of determining the detailed scheme to give effect to this decision.(3) Invited the Lord Presidents Committee to deal, withoutfurther reference to the War Cabinet, with the proposals in the Minister of Shipping&apos;s Paper in regard to the replacement of Allied tonnage.
Blockade.Application to japan.The AsakaMaru.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 25thConclusions,Minute 4.)9. The &quot;War Cabinet were informed that the Asaka Maruhad left Bilbao on the 12th March, and was believed to be returning to Japan via the Cape. It was not known at what ports she would call. There was some indication that the Japanese anticipated thatwe should not do more than make a strong protest in this case, inwhich event they would, no doubt, again have recourse to this expedient of &quot; Special service ships.&quot; The case was, therefore,important.The War Cabinet-Deferred a decision as to the action to be taken, but askedto be kept informed of the Asaka Maru&apos;s movements.Blockade.Interception ofescorted FrenchConvoys passing through theStraits of gibraltar.The S.S.Bangkok.10. The War Cabinet were informed that the S.S. Bangkok,believed to have 3.000 tons of rubber on board, had left Dakar on or about the 10th March. Importance was attached to stoppingthis ship, since there was information that 90 per cent, of the motor tyres manufactured in France went to Germany, which wassuffering from a shortage of rubber.The War CabinetsAuthorised the First Lord of the Admiralty to issue instructions that this ship should be intercepted, even ifescorted unless, of course, escorted by overwhelmingforce. Should the ship form part of a convoy of severalships, of which the remainder were food ships, theS.S. Bangkok should be picked out and the other shipsallowed to proceed (see Minute 3 above).Italy.Free ItalianMovement.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 19thConclusions,Minute 12.)11.on   the(W.P. (41) 51)The War Cabinet took note of a report of a committee proposed   formation   of   a   Free   Italian   MovementGreat George Street, S.W.March 13, 1941.
DEPAP.TIIErIT.AL (SBCPET\.Cypher telegram to Viscount Halifax (Washington).Foreign Office.       12th March, 1941.       5.50 p.m.No. 131+4.IMMEDIATE.Former Naval Person to President Roosevelt.Personal and Sec ret.Admiral Parian&apos;s declaration and threats make me wonder whetherit would not be &quot;best for youj^to intervene as a friend of &quot;both sides and try to bring about a working agreement.     We do not wish to pushthings to extremes and we naturally should be most reluctant in athing like this to act against your judgment after you have weighedall the pros and cons.     We fear- very much the prolongation of thewar and its miseries which would result from the breakdown of the&quot;blockade of Germany, and there are immense difficulties in preventingG-ermany from profiting directly or- indirectly from anything imported into unoccupied France.     Dealing with Darlan is dealing with Germany,for he will, not be allowed to agree to anything they know about whichdoes not suit their book.     Also- there is the danger of rationingspreading to occupied France, Belgium, Holland and Norway.      Perhapshowever you might be able to devise a scherje under American super-vision which would limit the leakage,  and might also give you anumber of agents in favourable positions in unoccupied France and in french Africa.      It would be easier for- you to tall: to   Vichy with-whom you are in regular diplomatic relations,  than for us tonegotiate via Madrid, or by making speeches on the broadcast.    Besidesthis, Parian has old scores to pay out against us because of the dire,action we were forced to take against his ships.2.   &apos; Would you therefore consider coning forward on the oasisof how shocked you were at the idea of fighting breaking out between france and Great Britain which would only help the comnon foe.,    Thenyou might be able to procure Vichy assent to a scheme for allowing a ration of wheat to go through, month by month to unoccupied france and  something for French Africa as long as other things were satisfactory.      These other things might form the subject of a secretarrangement of which the Germans would not know, by which Germaninfiltration into Morocco and French African ports would be limitedto bare Armistice terms, and by which an increasing number of French warships would gradually be moving from Toxilon to Casablanca or Dakar.3.      I have asked the Foreign Office to telegraph to Lord-Halifax all the sort of things we think should be taken care of,so that he can tell you about them, but the two I have mentionedare worth more to us than the disadvantages of a certain amount ofleakage of food to the enemy.     It would have to be made clear thatthe relief accorded was limited to stated quantities of food atagreed intervals, and did not extend to other goods.     For instance,there is a French ship the Bangkok with 3*000 tons of! rubber on board which is certainly not all for the teats of babies&apos; bottles,  and wehave abundant cases of all kinds of valuable munition materials whichare going straight through France to Germany or Italy not entirelywithout some greasing.     Moreover it would be a great pity if any large number of ships which are all needed for our life and the war effort were used up in food carrying.     I do not want the people here,who apart from heavy bombardment likely to be renewed soon, are having to&apos; tighten their belts and restrict their few remainingcomforts, to feel that I am not doing by best against the enemy.

Nevertheless if it were not unwelcome I would gladly invite you. toact as &quot;intermediary and make the best plan you can to heat Hitler.We have supreme confidence in you and would receive with profound-respect what you thought best to be done.h..     The bases question has I think been tidied up and I hope to bring an agreed, document before the Cabinet tomorrow Thursdayafternoon.     Will you let me know when you would like theannouncement to he made.     Does it matter if it comes on the morrow of the passing of the Lease-Lend. Bill?       Ends.Repeated to Madrid No. 9U and Lisbon Eo. 137 both Saving.
