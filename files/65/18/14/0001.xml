Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 33rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.Shipping Losses.United states assistance.Military .Operations.Libya.1. THE following reports were made in amplification ofCabinet War Room Records Nos. 576 to 578 : 12 Hurricanes had arrived in Malta, having been successfullyflown off an aircraft carrier.In the North Sea area successful attacks on enemy shipping andother targets had been carried out by aircraft of Bomber command and Coastal Command.The air attack against our shipping had been more intenseduring March than in any previous month. The approximatefigures of losses since the last report to the War Cabinet in march were :  Tonnage sunk By U-boats 10,000.By aircraft 700.Tonnage damaged By U-boats 17,000.By aircraft 41,000.These figures included as damaged all the five tankers attacked inthe Bristol Channel on the 1st April. They did not include four ships sunk off Iceland, about which a report had just come in.The Prime Minister said that he received a personal message from President Roosevelt, saying that he had allotted funds to buildanother 200 ships for us. He read to the War Cabinet his proposed reply, in which he drew attention to the urgent need for furtherescort vessels, as witness the four ships sunk off Iceland before theyhad met their escort.Our advanced units had been attacked on the 1st April by aGerman armoured column. Some of our forward posts had beenoverrun, and our troops were withdrawing to a position north ofAgedabia. The Germans were believed to have suffered considerablelosses.The War Cabinet were informed of the strength of our forcesin the Libyan theatre.The forces against us were believed to consist of one german armoured division, certain elements of two other German armoured divisions and four Italian divisions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.France. 2.   A discussion took place, a record of which is contained inThe French      the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions. &apos;Fleet.(previous reference:W,M.

The Balkans.Announcementof arrival ofImperial Forcesin Greece.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 31stConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Prime Minister said that a further telegram had beenreceived from General Wavell saying that he was most anxious thatno public announcement should be made of the arrival of our troopsin Greece. It was significant that, although the Italians had referred to the increase in our convoys to Greece, they had not mentioned that we had landed troops in Greece. Probably this was because this news would encourage the Yugoslavs. This in itself was a strong argument in favour of an announcement. But we mustadhere to our decision to leave this matter to be settled by those onthe spot.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Prince Friedrich 4 Tne War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theof Prussia. Home Secretary (W.P. (41) 75) about Prince Friedrich of Prussia,who had been interned in May 1940, sent to Canada in July 1940,and had been included in the first batch of internees who had been selected for return to this country with a view to their release beingconsidered.  He was now in the Oratory Schools, Brompton.In discussion, strong evidence was advanced that the Prince&apos;ssympathies were anti-Nazi. It was pointed out that he had only been interned in May 1940 because it had been decided to intern allmale Germans and Austrians living near the South and East coasts.Had he been in another area he would not have been interned.Looking to the position after the war, it was urged that there was considerable advantage in releasing him from internment, subject,of course, to proper surveillance.On the other hand, it was argued that strong opposition wouldbe aroused if any grounds were given for the belief that the Princewas being treated differently from other enemy aliens because hebelonged to the Hohenzollern family. It was important, therefore,that the Prince should be treated in accordance with the rules and procedure applicable to enemy aliens generally, although, owing tothe special features of his case, this presented certain difficulties.It was also suggested that it might be better that the Princeshould not return to Cambridge, but should be employed on landwork (possibly under some Agricultural Institute), or forestry work.This suggestion met with general approval.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusion was that they would be glad if the Home Secretary could make arrangements forPrince Friedrich to be released from internment, subject toproper restrictions and surveillance, provided that this could be done in conformity with the regulations applicableto enemy aliens generally.Baltic States.Repatriation of seamen toU.S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 83rdConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Shipping and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (G.) (41) 36). This Memorandumset out the various methods which had been explored forrepatriating 400 seamen, from the Baltic ships requisitioned inBritish ports, who had opted for Soviet nationality and for returnto that country,   iIn discussion, it was explained that there were between 300 and400 British subjects in Finland and Sweden who wished to be repatriated. These included a number of persons who hadvolunteered to fight for Finland, and also naval ratings from.M.S. Hunter who had escaped from Narvik.
After some discussion, the War Cabinet Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe Minister of Shipping to negotiate with the SovietGovernment on the following basis :-That, if the Soviet Government would grant visas andwould afford facilities to these British subjects in sweden and Finland to cross Russia on their way tothe Middle East, we should be prepared to cede one ofthe Baltic ships which we had requisitioned (withoutprejudice to our rights) and to allow the 400 seamento return to the Soviet Union in this ship, whichshould sail under the Soviet Flag.Due precautions should, of course, be taken to ensure thatthe Soviet Union carried out their side of the bargain.Great George Street, S.W. 1,April 3, 1941.
