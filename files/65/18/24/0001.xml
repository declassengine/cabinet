The Chiefs of Staff made the following reports in amplification-cation of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 604-606.Summary of aircraft losses since the 28th April:  Home Theatre Enemy 13 destroyed.1 probable.8 damaged.Our Own 13 destroyed (7 bombers, 2 fighters, 4 Coastal Com-mand aircraft).About 60 of the 130 aircraft based on Greek aerodromes had got away safely. Of the 1,700 Royal Air Force personnel sent to greece, all but about 100 had been evacuated.Shipping casualties since the 28th April had been: Ships lost, 9 (7 by submarine), about 59,000 tons.Ships damaged, 2, about 8,000 tons.Four ships had been lost in a daylight attack by submarines on a convoy.The evacuation operations were now complete. The totalnumber of Army personnel who had been got away was about43,000. Army personnel in Greece had been between 55,000 and56,000 not about 59,000, as we had previously understood.Of the troops who had reached recognised evacuation beaches,all but between 3,000 and 6,000 had been embarked. Of thoseembarked, not more than 500 had been subsequently lost. 1&quot;The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Sir Raids!Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 43rdConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Minister of Home Security said that Plymouth had suffered from air attacks five nights running. The last attack(night the 29th/30th April) had been less severe than some earlierattacks. One disturbing feature was that the press had drawn attention to an unofficial nightly exodus from Plymouth intosurrounding districts.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Minister of Home Security and the Ministerof Information to see the press that afternoon, and to draw their attention to the undesirability of publishing such reports.Iraq.(Previous;Reference:W.M. (410 43rd&apos;Conclusions,Minute&apos; 31)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave&apos; the1&apos; War&apos;Cabinet the latest information about the situation^ in Iraq. troops of the Iraqi Army had taken up positions on the hills surroundingHabbaniya aerodrome.With the Prime Minister&apos;s authority, a telegrani had been sentauthorising such measures being taken as were necessary to restore the position, including, if need5 be, the use of our aii* forces againstthe Iraq Army.The War Cabinet took note of the above information.ShippingsPublication ofShipping Losses.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 44thConclusions,Minute 4.)4&apos;! The War Cabinet had a preliminary disbussioh on a Memo-randum by the Prime Minister (W.P. (41) 93) suggesting that weshould now move from monthly to quarterly figures.The following were among the points made in discussion :.-(1) The Foreign Secretary thought that non-publication of thefigures might be taken in the United States as meaningthat the figures were so bad that we dared not publishthem.   This would encourage the defeatists.   If, laterC./G.S.dH^et^e fasa^eM A^hzc^^si.
on, when the figures were published, they were much better than had been expected, people would accuse us of&quot; clever &quot; work.(2) The Minister of Information, who favoured publication ofmonthly figures, said that the press had taken the change from weekly to monthly figures well, but they would regard with suspicion a change to a quarterly basis.(3) The First Lord of the Admiralty wished for time to con-sider the proposal. The War Cabinet should know thata full press conference had been informed definitely thatthe first monthly figure (for the calendar month ofApril) would be published on the 15th May.(4) The First Lord said he understood that at no time in thelast war had the publication of shipping losses, in one form or another, been withheld.(5) The Prime Minister said that the object he had in mind was not that the publication of losses should necessarily be withheld, but that we should get out of the positionin which we were committed to automatic publicationof th^ figures, whether or not it suited us to publishthem. As, however, the first monthly statement was not due until the 15th May, there was time for furtherreflection.The War Cabinet-^Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to make a reportto the War Cabinet on Thursday, the 8th May, setting outthe total shipping losses in the month of April, and a draft statement for issue to the Press.Home Defence.Evacuation of coastal Area.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 43rdConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that thismatter had been considered by the Defence Committee,* who had recommended : (a) That until definite signs of preparations for invasion began to be observed, there should be no extension of the banon visitors to the coastal belt.(b) That the Chiefs of Staff should keep a close watch on thesituation, and warn the War Cabinet when the firstsigns were observed, so that the extension of the bancould be considered among the first of the precautionarysteps to be taken.The War Cabinet endorsed these recommendations.Mr. Menzies. 6.   The Prime Minister said that this was the last occasion on which Mr. Menzies would attend the War Cabinet on this visit.He wished to say how much he and his colleagues had appreciatedhaving Mr. Menzies with them, and how much they had valued hiscounsel, and looked forward to having him among them again. Hehad won an outstanding place in the esteem of the British people,and would take back to Australia the admiration and affection ofall.Mr. Menzies said that he much appreciated what the PrimeMinister had said.   Fie was most grateful to members of the WarCabinet and other Ministers for their courtesy and kindness.  Theexperience and knowledge which he had gained during his visitu-- would be of the utmost value to him.Great George Street, S.W. 1,May 1, 1941.. -y . * d.O. (41) 20th Meeting, Minute 2.

Total number safely evacuated estimated43,000.     Casualties at sea during evacuation apparentlynot more than 500 lost in destroyers Diamond and Wryneck whichpicked up survivors of Slamat.   Of those who actually reachedrecognised evacuation beaches believed only between 3,000 and,000 not picked up of which majority at Kalamata and Nauplion.Cannot at present give figures of wounded and sick left in hospital or casualties before evacuation, but total in Greecebefore German attack probably 55,000 to 56,000.     Troops in good heart all brought away personal equipment, gun sights,optical equipment etc., as far as possible.     No doubt that our troops were completely on top wherever they met Germans underreasonable conditions and inflicted heavy losses on them in personnel and material.     Great numerical superiority in the air and numbers of A.F.V. were the only factors in which enemy had   advantage.0o4o (Telegrams)
