The Chiefs of Staff made the following reports in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 558 to 561 : Aircraft losses over this country since the 13th March hadbeen Enemy 27 destroyed.5 probable.15 damaged.Our own 2 Fighters (1 pilot safe).In addition we had lost during the same period 7 Bombers and2 Coastal Reconnaissance aircraft.In the Greek operations since the 13th March, the losses amounted to Enemy 20 destroyed.8 damaged.Our own 2 Fighters (both pilots safe).The known losses during the last four days amounted to27,000 tons. In addition, however, 7 ships of a total tonnage ofsome 35,000 tons had been attacked by enemy raiders on the previous day, although it was not yet known if all 7 had been sunk^-Shipping damaged during the last four days amounted to150,000 tons, most of which had occurred during the enemy* air attack on Merseyside and Manchester. It was hoped that thegreater part of this tonnage would be salvable.The Destroyer escort of a homeward-bound convoy had sunk2 U-boats, one by ramming (the crew of which had been saved) andthe other by depth charges. The crew of a third submarine hadbeen on board one of these U-boats. The Admiralty were asked toconsider whether the usual rule should not be waived, and this information made public.One of our capital ships had sighted one of the enemy battle cruisers, together with a ship believed to have been a tanker, some400-500 miles South-East of Newfoundland, but had lost them inthe gathering darkness.On the previous morning Berbera had been retaken, togetherwith 100 prisoners.Attacks against Keren had been renewed on the previous day and Brigadier&apos;s Peak (three miles West of Keren) had been secured.Our forces had been meeting with considerable resistance.

The Prime Minister said that the pressure being put upon us to deal at very short notice with our United States investmentswas, he thought, inconsistent with the great benefits we shouldreceive under the Lease and Lend Act. With the Chancellorsconcurrence, he had sent a telegram to Lord Halifax (No. 1427to Washington) suggesting that it was impossible for us to continueto make concessions at short notice to meet the exigencies of UnitedStates politics. He had accordingly suggested that the discussions on this matter should be allowed to simmer for two or three days.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Magna Gharta. 4.   The  War  Cabinet had  before them a Note by  the suggested        Parliamentary Under-Secretary of  State  for  Foreign  Affairspresentation of    (W.P. (41) 60).the Lincoln Discussion showed that opinion was somewhat divided, somecopy to the Ministers thinking that the proposed gift, if made quickly, wouldAmerican be greatly a ppreciated;  while others doubted whether it wouldnation. greatly   influence  opinion   in   the  United   States  and   fearedunfavourable reactions in the Dominions.It was pointed out that it was of the utmost importance thatthis proposal should not become known, if there was any risk thatit would not be carried through.The War Cabinet-Postponed a decision, and invited the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to makediscreet enquiries of the Dean and Chapter of LincolnCathedral on the lines indicated in his Note.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M.

Air Services.Overseas AirCommunica-tions.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 296thConclusions,* Minute 5.)*Great George Street, S.W. 1,March 17, 1941.6. The War Cabinet were informed that, since this matter had last been before the War Cabinet, it had been the subject of conversation between the Prime Minister, the Minister of aircraft production and the Secretary of State for Air. The Prime minister had given the following ruling, which he asked the War Cabinet to endorse: (1) The three Boeing Clippers should go to the Takoradi route.(2) Of the six B. 24&apos;s, one, the first, should help the Minister ofEconomic Warfare in his Scandinavian work, and theother five should be employed on ferrying pilots acrossthe Atlantic under M.A.P.(3) The turret development must wait till the seventh B- 24 isdelivered,- unless there was some better plan.(4) The Air Ministry must continue to assist to their utmostM.A.P. in the process of ferrying.The Secretary of State for Air said that, while he accepted this ruling, he wished to raise a point on (2). The British overseas airways Corporation was the statutory body charged with overseascommunications, and he was the Minister responsible therefor.He thought that the work of maintaining communications acrossthe Atlantic should continue to be done by B.O.A.C., full prioritybeing given to the transport of ferry pilots and any additional spaceallotted to other uses.The Prime Minister said that he thought that it was undesirable that the responsibility for ferrying these pilots shouldbe divided between two Departments. He saw no difficulty injustifying to Parliament an arrangement whereby this work was done by the Ministry of Aircraft Production.The Postmaster-General said that the point in which he was mainly interested was the Takoradi service. It was impossible toprovide an adequate mail service to our troops in the Middle Eastunless he was given a regular allotment of 340 kilos, per flight.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he was not clear towhat extent this proposal affected the availability of long-rangeUnited States aircraft for use on the North-Western Approaches.He hoped that four Stirlings could be allotted for this work untilother aircraft could be made available.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s ruling set out above, and agreed that the arrangements for ferrying pilots across the atlantic, for which the five B. 24&apos;s were to be used, shouldbe administered by the Minister of Aircraft Production,who should be responsible therefor. Any consequentialre-allocation of responsibilities between the Secretary ofState for Air and the Minister of Aircraft production should be adjusted between the two Ministers.

IS- MOST SECRET -In connection with. W*M.(41) 89. MinuteTHE PRIME MINISTER said that the position resultingfrom the present shipping losses presented a most formidable problem, and one which must be tackled by every means in our power.   We were at the momentcompletely on the defensive at sea, and the admiralty had had to disperse many important units from the home fleet for convoy duties and to hunt the raiders on the atlantic routes.   Prom the point of view of invasion,this detachment of forces would have to be carefully watched.   A very heavy toll had been taken of ourmerchant shipping, and he thought that at the presenttime our Naval resources were at a fuller stretch thanthey had been at any time in the last war.One method of relieving our difficulties would balfour the United States would convoy ships West of the30th meridian.   Another way would, be if the UnitedStates would allow some of their warships to cruisein the Atlantic and to pass on to us information obtained by them as to the whereabouts of Germanraiders.   Such an act would be less un-neutral thanthe convoying of ships .The Prime Minister, continuing, said that he had seen Mr Winant and Mr Harriman over the week-end, andhad been greatly encouraged by their attitude.   Thesetwo gentlemen were apparently longing for Germany to commit some overt act that would relieve the Presidentof his election and. pre-election declaration regardingkeeping out of the war.   Mr Harriman had. said that theUnited. States might be prepared to escort their ownships outside the prohibited area.   He was working out a scheme whereby United States ships would, take overthe long hauls, leaving us with the short hauls.   Theywere also planning a very big merchant shipbuilding programme, which would mature in 1942.Continuing, the Prime Minister said, that our shipping difficulties were the blackest cloud which we had to face.But we must remember that we had dealt with, and overcome,equal perils in the past.PGreat George Street, S.W.1,17th March, 1941.SHIPPING losses and THE ATTITUDEOP THE UNITEDSTATES.
