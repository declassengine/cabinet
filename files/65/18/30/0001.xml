France.Relations withthe vichy government.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 44thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the attitude ofthe Vichy Government in allowing the German Air Force to make use of aerodromes in Syria, he thought that the House of Commonsmight expect a statement from His Majesty&apos;s Government on the irrelations with the Vichy Government, more particularly following the declaration made by the United States Government.The Prime Minister thought that it might be premature tomake a statement on the following day. Consideration, however,should be given to the question whether the action of the vichy government released us from some of the engagements We had entered into, e.g., in regard to the French Fleet at Alexandria.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 49thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gave the following information : Night of 16th/17th May.

Hethought it would be wise to accede to this request and to state duringthe debate on the Fire Brigade Bill on the following day that theGovernment would welcome such a debate at a convenient opportunity.The War Cabinet agreed to this proposal.Mines and 6.

Conscription.Application toNorthernIreland.(previous reference,: .   ,.W.M. (41) 49thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a. Note setting out three questions to the Prime Minister for reply on the following day, inregard to the application of conscription to Northern Ireland(W.P. (41) 104).The War Cabinet were, reminded that, when the compulsory military graining Bill had been under consideration in May 1939,Lord Craigavon had wished conscription to be applied to NorthernIreland, but had agreed to leave the decision to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. , ..,.,.;, A preliminary discussion showed that the War Cabinet, whilegenerally in favour of the application of conscription to NorthernIreland, felt that it would be better to defer a decision untildiscussion could take place on the Memorandum which the Ministerof Labour and National Service was preparing in consultation withthe Ministers concerned.The War Cabinet-(a) Agreed that the Prime Minister should answer theQuestions down for reply on the following day by sayingthat this matter had for some time been engaging theattention of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that, ifthese Questions were repeated that day week, he hoped to be in a position to give an answer.(&amp;) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security to inform the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, in confidence, that His Majesty&apos;s Government were disposed to apply conscription to Northern Ireland, but would be glad of an expression of the views of theNorthern Ireland Government on the matter.(c) Agreed that no communication on the matter should bemade to the Eire Government until a final decision hadbeen reached, but that the Eire Government should beinformed of the decision reached, as a matter of courtesy,before any public announcement was made.Holidays.The WhitsunBreak.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 32ndConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (G) (41) 50) aboutthe Whitsun holidays. The Production Executive had agreed thatthe Whitsun holiday should be cancelled in the case of firms and factories engaged on specially urgent munitions work. The point at issue was the procedure to be adopted. One course was to dealwith the matter by letters sent to individual firms by the ProductionMinistries. This was the course approved by the production executive. The second course was that the Prime Minister shouldmake a public statement in order to ensure that the appeal tocontinue work over the Whitsun break was effective.After a short discussion, in the course of which the PrimeMinister said that he was reluctant to make a public appeal on thismatter if it could be avoided, the War Cabinet rReaffirmed the conclusion of the Production Executive thatthe former course should be adopted.Rudolf Hess. 9.   The War Cabinet were reminded that on the 13th May the(Previous Prime Minister had said that he would make a further statementBeference: in the House about Rudolf Hess.  Should such a statement be madeW.M. (41) 50th on the following day ?Conclusions, The general view of the War Cabinet was that it would be minute 1.) undesirable to make a full statement in Parliament on the following
day. Hess had already received so much attention in the Press that public opinion would favour giving the topic a rest. The absenceof a statement was also calculated to maintain the anxiety of the nazi leaders.Accordingly, the War Cabinet Agreed with the view that the Prime Minister shouldmake no further statement on the matter at the present stage. If it was necessary for some public statement tobe made as to the Duke of Hamilton&apos;s part in the affair,this could be done by a Question addressed to the Secretaryof State for Air.Great George Street, S.W. 1,May 19, 1941.
