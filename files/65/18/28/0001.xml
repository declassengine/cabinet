Damage to factories wasnot serious, but all other types of property had suffered heavily,including the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Hall,Westminster Abbey and the British Museum. It was feared that casualties would be high. A provisional estimate was600 killed and 1,000 seriously injured. The Mayors of westminster and Bermondsey had been killed.It was agreed that these casualties of Civil Authorities inthe performance of their duty should be announced publicly.The Civil Defence Services as a whole, and the fire brigade Services in particular, had done admirable service indealing with the widespread fires and damage in this heavyraid.Night of 11th/ 12th.

As a result normalwastage (55,000 a quarter) could not be replaced; still less could the Army strength be brought up to the figureof 2,195,000 laid down in the Prime Minister&apos;s Directive(W.P. (41) 69).In addition, the Army plan had reckoned onreplacing over 100,000 men in AD.G.B by women.

THE middle east.^OperationL&apos;;Tiger&quot;.[previous reference:W.M.(41) 48thConclusions,Minute 2.)THE PRIME MINISTER said that Operation &quot;TIGER&quot; had now been successfully completed, with the exception ofone ship (EMPIRE SONG) which had struck a mine and sunk.This ship had by no means had the most valuable cargo .He was sure that the War Cabinet would wish to congratulate-late the Navy and the R.A.F. on the very successfularrangements which they had made for the escort of thisconvoy, which had been sighted, by the   enemy at an early stage in its   voyage.The result would be greatly to increase general wavell*s strength in heavy tanks, for which he already had ample personnel.   As soon as the tanks had been&quot;run in&quot;, General Wavell would have a great opportunity,and for this reason it was essential to maintain the strictest secrecy as to the extent of the reinforcements in materiel which had been carried in this convoy.During the movements of the Fleet to es cort thisconvoy, Benghazi had been bombarded.   Ships had been sunk in the harbour, and two ships on their way toBenghazi, including an annumition ship, had been sunk.The Prime Minister added that further operations were on foot regarding additional air reinforcements tothe Middle East.In Iraq, things were better, but progressing slowly.General Wavell was anxious to meet Cin-C. India, and.it was proposed that he should fly to Basra to meet him.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY referred to a telegram fromAleppo,(No. 12 of 10th May) reporting that three GermanHeinkel aircraft had. landed in Syria, escorted by asmall French plane.   Among the passengers was a GermanGeneral, who had been receiving members of the Germancolony all day.   This information was disquieting.THE PRIME MINISTER also read to the War Cabinet a personal letter from President Roosevelt, dealing withthe situation generally and, in particular, with themilitary position in the Middle East.   The terms of this message were very satisfactory.0r Great George Street, S.W.1,12th May, 1941.- MOST SECRET -ANNEX.(See Minute 2.)
