The Chiefs of Staff made the following reports in amplification-cation of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 600-603.Summary of aircraft losses since the 24th April: Home Theatre Enemy 5 destroyed.1 probable.8 damaged.Our Own 13 destroyed.    (8  bombers,Command aircraft.)3  fighters,  2  CoastalThat afternoon a Stirling bomber, taking advantage of cloud, hadbeen over Emden for three-quarters of an hour and had returned safely. It had dropped 18 500-lb. bombs and had machine-gunnedthe streets from a height of 1,500 feet.News of air fighting in the Middle East was very scanty.Shipping casualties since the 24th April had been : Ships Lost By aircraft: 1 ship about 4,600 tons.Ships Damaged By aircraft: 3 ships about 21,000 tons.In addition to the above casualties, most of which had been inthe North-Western Approaches, there had been some heavy losses in Greek waters, mostly Greek vessels. For the period lst-28th april the figures in respect of Greek waters were : Tonnage sunk or destroyed about 64,000.Tonnage damaged about 73,000.Particulars were given of the areas in the Western Atlanticbeing patrolled by units of the United States Navy.Particulars were also given of the manner in which the sub-marine Regent, which had gone to Kotor to take off His Majesty&apos;minister to Yugoslavia and his staff, had made good her escape afterfinding that the port was in enemy occupation. The Commander&apos;conduct had been cool and gallant.It was now known that Mr. Campbell, our Minister in Yugo-slavia, was a prisoner.An important convoy had arrived safely at Malta from theWestern Mediterranean.Evacuation of our troops was proceeding. The total of our forces in Greece had been about 42,000, or 59,000 if base details were included. The latest telegram reported that some 27,000 hadbeen evacuated, of whom 13,000 had landed in Crete. It was believed that this figure of 27,000 covered those evacuated in the lasttwo or three days, and did not include a number of base details whohad been evacuated earlier. It was hoped that these figures would,be substantially increased.The enemy had advanced from Sollum in three columns, whichhad penetrated some five or six miles across the frontier.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Balkans and the 2.

Parliament. 3.   The Prime Minister said that in view of the progress ofDebate on events, he saw no reason why there should not now be a public debateAssistance to in the House of Commons. The critics of the Government wereGreece and Mili- few, but vocal; but they had succeeded in spreading reports of dis-&quot;tary Operations satisfaction which, he believed, were entirely false. His impression in the Middle from going about the country was of complete national unity. Par-East, liamentary government depended on voting, and not merely on debate.He proposed, therefore, that on the occasion of the debate, whichmight be on the following Thursday, the Government should putdown a Resolution and make it a matter of confidence.This view met with acceptance, but it was felt that the termsof the Resolution would require a good deal of thought. The PrimeMinister said that he would speak himself, and would prefer to open the debate.Mr. Menzies suggested that the defence of our action in send-ing help to Greece should be based, not so much on the guaranteewe had given Greece, as on the compelling reasons of internationalhonour which necessitated our participation in the Greek campaign.The view was also expressed that the campaign had been strategic-ally sound. The enemy had hoped to have a walk through, and hadbeen compelled to fight his way with considerable losses.The War Cabinet: (1) Agreed that arrangements should be made for a one day&apos;debate in the House of Commons on Thursday, the1st May,* on the policy of sending help to Greece and onthe conduct of military operations in the Middle East.(2) Agreed that a Resolution should be put down by the Govern-ment and treated as one of confidence. A three linewhip should be issued, and the Chief Whip should arrange for the attendance of Members of the Houseserving in the Forces.(3) Invited the Prime Minister to settle the terms of the Reso-lution, in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal, theMinister without Portfolio, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Secretary of State for Air and the chief whip.Shipping.Publication ofShipping Losses.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 40thConclusions,Minute 1.)Munitionsfrom the UnitedStates sunk at sea.4. The War Cabinet were reminded that on the 7th Aprilthey had decided that in future shipping losses should be publishedmonthly, instead of weekly. The April figures were due to bepublished shortly. Although the losses in Greek waters had been fairly serious, the losses as a whole were much lighter thananticipated.The Prime Minister thought that if unexpectedly low figures were now published, this might give a handle to American Isola-tionists at a crucial moment. He therefore - thought that thepublication of the April shipping losses, due to be made at the endof the month, should be deferred for the present. Publication ofthese figures might perhaps be put on a quarterly basis.The War Cabinet were reminded that there was considerable pressure for publication of figures of the losses which had occurredof munitions from the United States while crossing the Atlantic.The general view of the Cabinet was against publishing informa-tion on this subject at the present time, on the grounds that the small proportion of munitions from America so lost might have an unfortunate effect on American opinion. ,Note. This date has since been altered to Tuesday, May 6.
Information. 5.   In connection with the preceding item, the Minister ofMilitary Information referred to the complaints made by our Ambassador in operations. Washington that he was not provided with adequate information(Previous on military matters.   (Telegram 1726 from Washington.)Reference: Mr. Menzies said that the journalists and Press in the UnitedW.M. (40) 292nd States were strongly pro-British, but that the bulk of their newsConclusions,      came from German sources because we did not provide them with minute 8.)       adequate news.   He thought that the dissatisfaction of Australian.   opinion had also been due to the dearth of news.    Generally, hethought that we underestimated the propaganda value of newsservice.  &apos;In discussion, considerable support was expressed for this view.The Prime Minister pointed out that in regard to the opera-tions in Greece it would have been impossible for us to give more information, since for a period of several critical days we had beenwithout any information ourselves. He had sent a telegram of protest to General Wavell. In conditions such as prevailed in this war, he thought that there must necessarily be periods whenvirtually nothing could be said about the progress of operations.But later a time would come when a full account could be given.As, for example, in the debate which had now been arranged.The Lord Privy Seal thought that a distinction should be drawn between information about military operations, which must be kept secret, and adequate descriptions of events after they had takenplace. A strong endeavour should be made to get the latter typeof information published fully and quickly.The importance of photographs was also emphasised, and theMinister of Information said that he was proposing to discuss thequestion with his Service colleagues in order to ensure more adequate machinery in the Services to enable rapid accounts, in-cluding photographs, to be made available as quickly as possible inregard to successful operations.The War Cabinet :-Took note of the discussion, and of the statement made bythe Minister of Information.France.Relations withthe vichy government.Syria.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 8thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Foreign Secretary said that the position of Syria was serious. An attempt was being made to ascertain what actionGeneral Dentz would take if German air-borne troops landed in syria. If he said that he would resist, we should offer to help him.If, on the other hand, he said that he would have to obey the orders of the Vichy Government, the position was grave.The Foreign Secretary therefore favoured an approach to theFrench Government to deal with three contingencies: (a) german air-borne troops landing in Syria, (6) German occupation ofMorocco, (c) passage of German troops through unoccupied France.We should make it clear that if the Vichy Government allowed anyof these things to happen, we should hold ourselves free to takeThe War Cabinet :-(1) Decided against the publication of particulars of munitionsfrom the U.S.A. lost while on the Atlantic.(2) Took note with approval of the suggestion that the publica-tion of the April shipping losses should be deferred forthe present.
action as military necessities might require (e.g., bombing Germanlines of communication in France), and should no longer be bound by our undertaking to restore the independence and greatnessof France. If, on the other hand, the French were willing to resist,we should do all that we could to help them. It was important tomake it clear to the French that they could, not reckon on our supportat the Peace Conference if they took no action to resist the enemy.Points made in discussion : (1) The Prime Minister thought that the most effective coursewould be if His Majesty&apos;s Government were to tell the vichy Government, through the United States Govern-ment, that they would be doing a great wrong if they agreed to German troops landing in Syria, or Morocco,or passing through unoccupied France. He favoured a snorter document than the Foreign Secretary had inmind.(2) The Secretary of State for War said that a report had beenreceived from General Wavell that French morale in syria was low, and that only token resistance might be offered to a landing by enemy air-borne troops.(3) It was pointed out that Syria was a Mandated Territory,and as the Vichy Government was no longer a member ofthe League of Nations, we should be on strong ground intreating Syria differently from other territoriesadministered by the Vichy Government.(4) The Secretary of State for the Colonies thought that, fromthe point of view of our position at the Peace Conference,it was very desirable to free ourselves from any obliga-tion to maintain Syria under French rule. This, how-ever, was a long-term project.The War Cabinet :-(a) Approved the suggestion that this matter should be dealtwith by a communication addressed to the vichy government by His Majesty&apos;s Government, through theUnited States Government, on the lines proposed by theForeign Secretary.(6) Invited the Defence Committee to consider the terms ofthis communication^ a draft of which would be furnished by the Foreign Secretary.Turkey.General Policy.Supply ofMunitions, &amp;c.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, reviewing our policy towardsTurkey, with particular reference to the continued sending ofsupplies to Turkey (W.P. (41) 77).The Foreign Secretary thought that we must acquiesce in theTurkish view that Turkey&apos;s role must be a passive one, but that weshould continue and accelerate the programme of supplies, both military and civil, to Turkey.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, as Chairman of theCommittee on Allied Supplies, reviewed the position of supplies to turkey. Military requirements were being furnished, in the firstplace, in accordance with the Anglo-French Agreements com-supplementary to our treaty. As was natural, we had supplied less to Turkey of those items of which we were short, but items such as.clothing or motor tyres had been supplied in full. The most serious-* Despatched as telegram No. 2289 to Washington, dated April 29, 1911.
arrears were in respect of articles which had been due to be supplied by France and which we had undertaken to provide after the Frenchcollapse. The difficulties of the position were increased by the factthat the Turkish armaments comprised a very large number ofdifferent types. We were, however, doing our best to obtain supplies from the United States.There was also a long list of civil supplies which Turkeyrequired. These included considerable quantities of raw material.Locomotives, both light and heavy, were badly required owing to theweak state of the Turkish railways. Material was also required forthe coalmines at Zunguldak, which, however, were not strategicallyin a very sound position. It looked as though imports to Turkeycould now only be brought in through Mersin and Is.kanderun, andas though the Turks ought to be asked to transfer landing material to these ports from other ports which we could not now use.If it was intended to go all out to help Turkey, this wouldinvolve : (i) The largest possible release of British material still dueunder the Agreement.(ii) Diplomatic pressure in the United States to manufactureTurkish requirements, at some cost to our own require-ments.(iii) Priority of steel for civilian requirements of a strategiccharacter.(iv) Pressure on the Turks to move transport facilities.If this policy was to be pursued, we ought to insist on our Mili-tary Mission being permanently installed at Ankara, in order thatwe might be better informed than at present on technical matters.The Prime Minister thought that we must acquiesce in theview that Turkey&apos;s role would be a passive one; but as a neutral she might protect our flank. As regards supplies to Turkey, he saw noreason to reach any far-reaching decision that day. Events were likely to develop quickly in the Middle East. Our policy should bebased on the fact that no useful purpose would be served by puttingstrong pressure on Turkey. Equally it would be wrong atthis moment to discontinue furnishing supplies to Turkey.We should therefore continue to send supplies, but thevolume should not be increased. Indeed it might be awise precaution to diminish the despatch of articles whichwould have little or no value to our own forces in the Middle Eastif circumstances were to prevent their delivery to Turkey. ThePrime Minister thought that if events should be so managed thatthe enemy forces did not march through Turkey, we should havederived a great benefit from the Turkish alliance. The factor whichwas most likely to be effective in persuading Turkey to remainfaithful to the alliance would be a still further advance on the partof the United States towards the attitude of belligerent alliance.The War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) We should acquiesce in the view that Turkey&apos;s role mustfor the present be a passive one.(2) Our policy in regard to furnishing military and civilsupplies to  Turkey should  for the present be asfollows : We must continue to furnish supplies. Thereshould, however, be no increase in the volume ofsupplies; rather, caution should be exercised inregard to long-term projects; and no undue callsshould be made on shipping space in respect ofarticles which would be of little service to ourselves in the Middle East.
Turkey. 8.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, after consulta-Territorial tion with the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister, instruc-w-aters. tions had been issued on Saturday, the 26th April, that vesselsidentified as enemy vessels might be attacked within Turkishterritorial waters by H.M. Ships and aircraft, provided : (a) Care was taken to avoid damage to persons and dwelling houses ashore.(b) Attacks were not made within the Dardanelles Straits.The War Cabinet :-Gave covering approval to these instructions.Great George Street, S.W.I..April 28, 1941.
Copy of a Telegram from the Foreign Office to washington, dated 29th April, 1941.No. 2289.MOST IMMEDIATE.Please request United States Government to transmitthrough their Ambassador in Vichy following message fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government to French Government:-&quot;If French Government allow Germans or Italians toland unopposed in Syria, or to occupy North Africa leading to West Africa and use those countries for operations against ourselves, or if they permit passage of german troops through unoccupied France, France will then havebeen forced from capitulation to collaboration and itorncollaboration to participation in the war and will suffer from both sides and gain nothing.ouch participation would constitute a departure fromthe condition of passive capitulation in which Francereceived from us our guarantee to restore her independence and greatness.      It would be impossible for us to maintain in any respect the distinction we have hitherto drawn between unoccupied and. occupied France in the executionof our military and economic plans.If, oh the other hand, the French Government would effectively resist these encroachments, we should give them the utmost assistance in our power.      It should bepossible to hold Syria against any forces which the Axiscould bring against it in the near future.     The Frenchand British fleets acting together in the eastern mediterranean could cut Axis communications with Africa,and invaluable bases would be available to us.     french resistance and renewed Franco-British collaboration would go far to prevent the dangers which the French at presentfear.&quot;We should not be too hopeful of the effect of this message, but it is the best that we can do for the moment.The United States Government have a special interest in north Africa, and must be fully aware of the critical situation developing there.      The arrival of United Statesobservers may steady the situation, but events are movingfast.     They will have noticed suggestions from Frenchsources that protective United States forces should be landed at North and West African Atlantic ports.      This maynot be practical politics at the moment, but some effectmight be produced by visits of units of United States fleet to Dakar and Casablanca.Short of that, it would be of great value if UnitedStates Government would indicate that they entirely share the sentiments that have inspired foregoing messages.Please urge United States Government to instruct their Ambassador, in communicating message from HisMajesty&apos;s Government, to make strong representation ontheir behalf on similar lines.
