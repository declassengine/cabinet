suffered fairly heavily, but little damage had been done to the docks.Casualties could not at present be estimated. It was known that560 people had been killed, but this number might well be doubled.2,000 seriously injured had so far been reported. Traffic congestionwas serious, and it would probably be necessary to take steps to keepunnecessary traffic off the roads in the areas affected.The First Lord of the A dmiralty reported that the bomb whichhad fallen on the Admiralty Building had destroyed two or threerooms on all the floors down to the ground floor in the South Block,and 100 rooms had been rendered temporarily uninhabitable.

(G) (41) 39).The Secretary of State for Air said that the United states authorities thought that they could not permit a public appeal for volunteers for enlistment in an armed force. The present schemewas not quite so attractive from our point of view, but would serve the purpose of obtaining the skilled men required. The next step would be to set up a recruiting organisation in the United States.This would be followed by publicity. The development of thisscheme would, of course, be carried out in consultation with theTreasury.  The War Office agreed with it.The War Cabinet-Approved the establishment of an Overseas CivilianTechnical Corps, to be recruited in the United States, onthe lines set out in the Memorandum.
