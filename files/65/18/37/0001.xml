A telegram fromGeneral Wavell despatched at 9 that morning said that theoperation seemed to be going alright.The Prime Minister read out a telegram from Mr. Menziesregarding Cyprus/&quot;and asked for the advice of the Chiefs of staff as to the reply to be sent.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Foreign Affairs.Relations withthe vichy government.Syria.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 57thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave thefollowing information: The Vichy Government had communicated to us, through theirAmbassador in Madrid, the text of a note which they had handed to the American Ambassador. This note was milder in tone than might have been expected. Sir Samuel Hoare said that during the interview the French Ambassador had showed no excitement.(Telegrams 844 and 845 from Madrid.)[22606]b 2
The Allies.Meeting ofAlliedRepresentatives.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 295thConclusions,Minute 9.)U.S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 56thConclusions,Minute 2.)The TTniteaStates.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 57thConclusions,Minute 2.)Arrangements were being made to hold a meeting of allied representatives. Such a meeting had been proposed in November,but had fallen through, owing to the fact that the Greeks had not felt inclined to take part, as they were not then at war withGermany. The meeting would be held on the following Thursdayat St. James&apos;s Palace. The Prime Minister would first address themeeting, and, after speeches by the representatives of the Allies, aresolution would be passed expressing determination to continue thestruggle until victory had been won. The moment seemed particu-larly opportune to pass such a resolution, as there were indications that Hitler was about to make a speech on the subject of a FederatedEurope. No reference should be made to this meeting until afterthe event.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposal.(2) Agreed that the Free French Representative should attendas a full member, representing General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether Ethiopiashould be represented at this meeting.The War Cabinet were given some further information as tothe relations between Germany and the U.S.S.R. This is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The Prime Minister said that he had been proposing to discuss with Captain Roosevelt on his arrival in this country a suggestion made by the latter that the United States would take over, equipand defend an air base in West Africa. Captain Roosevelt had nowbeen detained in Lisbon; he (the Prime Minister) intended to send a message to President Roosevelt without further delay to say thatthe plan had our full approval.Parliament.Crete and Syria.ProposedDebate in theHouse ofCommons.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 57thConclusions,Minute 2.)Africa.Control ofOccupiedEnemy Terri-tories and ethiopia.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 57thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. It was pointed out that, if a debate on operations in Cretehad not been arranged for the following day, the normal coursewould probably have been for the Prime Minister to have made astatement as to the events in Syria. Should he make such a state-ment at the opening of the proceedings, as well as replying to the debate, or should he include news as to the position in Syria in his reply to the debate?The War Cabinet favoured the latter course.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War on the control of occupied enemy territories and Ethiopia (W.P. (41) 124): The main problem arose in Ethiopia, where, until recently, we had claimed the authority ofan Army of Occupation. Paragraphs 3 and 6 of the Memorandumset out certain general lines on which an attempt might now bemade to arrive at an understanding with the Emperor of Ethiopia.Among other matters, it was suggested that the Emperor might berequired to accept the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Government in all important matters, internal and external. It was also proposed toappoint a high official (a) To exercise, with the title of &quot; High Commissioner,&quot; fullpolitical, administrative and legislative authority inrespect of Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, and super-vising authority for the time being over the military governor of British Somaliland.
The Dominions.ProposedImperial War-Conference.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 282nd-Conclusions,Minute 6.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs on the proposed Meetingof Dominion Prime Ministers (W.P. (41) 121).In discussion, the view was generally expressed that it wouldbe a good plan to have an Imperial Conference in, say, the latter half of July or August, if the Dominion Prime Ministers found it possible to visit this country. . Mr. Mackenzie King might find itdifficult to leave Canada and visit this country. In view of thepolitical difficulties involved, he should be privately sounded before a definite invitation was sent to him to attend an ImperialConference., The War Cabinet accordingly agreed as follows : (1) The Prime Minister undertook to send a personal telegram to Mr. Mackenzie King, asking whether it would bepossible for him to come to this country in July for an imperial Conference. (The Dominions Secretary under-took to furnish the Prime Minister with a draft.)(&amp;) To act as &quot;British Agent-General &quot; in Ethiopia, where hewould be the sole channel of communication between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Emperor.In discussion, the importance was stressed of avoiding givingcolour to any idea that we were treating Ethiopia as part of theBritish Empire. From this point of view, the title of this highofficial was of importance. It was suggested that he might be called&quot; Political Adviser to the General Officer Commanding.&quot;The statement in Appendix II to W.P. (41) 124 as to the special problems which arose in Tigre, the Ogaden and the Borana led to discussion of the Emperor&apos;s powers. Would he be prepared toaccept the limitations on his powers indicated in this note ?Sir Philip Mitchell said that the Emperor was not aware ofthe proposals contained in this Paper, but he thought the Emperorwould recognise that he could not, at the moment, extend effectiverule to these territories, although he could not admit this openly,and that the settlement proposed would be acceptable to him.The Prime Minister thought&apos; that the Emperor should besounded personally by Sir Philip Mitchell, who was returning toEthiopia in a few days, before effect was given to the scheme set outin the Secretary of State for War&apos;s Memorandum. It should bemade clear to the Emperor that we were anxious to give him every opportunity to make a real success of his restoration to the throne,and that our policy would be directed to this end.The War Cabinefs Conclusions were as follows: (1) The titles of the high official referred to in paragraph 6 (a)and (6) should be &quot; Political Adviser to the Commander-in-Chief (Chief Political Officer, Middle East),&quot; and&quot; British Representative,&quot; respectively.(2) Subject to the above, the proposals in the Secretary of Statefor War&apos;s Memorandum were approved as the basis onwhich Sir Philip Mitchell should sound the Emperorwith a view to arriving at an understanding witlThim onthe issues involved.(3) Sir Philip Mitchell, who was returning immediately toEthiopia, was asked to send a full report for submission to the War Cabinet, describing the Emperor&apos;s reactionsand any developments in the position.(4) If any difficulty arose in obtaining the Emperor&apos;s willingacceptance of a scheme on the lines proposed, the matter should be referred to the War Cabinet.
(2) The Dominions Secretary was asked to telegraph to Field-Marshal Smuts asking whether he could visit thiscountry, say, in the latter half of July. He should be told there was a possibility that an Imperial conference could be arranged, but, in any case, we should be glad if he could visit us. The Prime Minister undertook tosend a personal message to Field-Marshal Smuts at thesame time.(3) The Prime Minister would take an early opportunity ofreferring in the House of Commons, in general terms, tothe desirability of holding an Imperial Conference,which we would welcome; but would point out that theDominions were differently circumstanced in this matter,and that it might not be easy to arrange for all theDominion Prime Ministers to visit this country at thesame time.(4) If it proved impossible to arrange for an Imperial Con-ference this summer, we should continue with our plan of a succession of visits to this country by dominion prime Ministers.6.   The War Cabinet had before them the following papers : (i) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State^for India, towhich was attached telegrams exchanged with theViceroy (W.P. (G) (41) 53).(ii) A further Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India(W.P. (G) (41) 59), containing an exchange of telegrams between the Prime Minister and the Viceroy.The Viceroy proposed that the following steps should betaken: (a) The Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council should be expanded by theaddition of three non-official Indian members.(b) These fresh portfolios would be found by separating Lawfrom Supply, and by creating Departments of Informa-tion and of Man-Power and Labour.(c) Simultaneously with the expansion of the Council, theViceroy intended to announce that he proposed to havea War Committee of his Council.(d) A War Advisory Council was to be constituted, broadly onthe lines discussed the previous autumn, the membersbeing selected by the Viceroy.The Secretary of State for India said that the above proposalsall fell within the scope of what had been approved by the WarCabinet in the previous autumn. At that time, however, it hadbeen proposed to add to the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council six members, who would have included representatives of the main political parties. While the present proposals could not be repre-sented as making any political concessions, they would do something to associate Indians with the war effort, and would help to meet the criticisms of our friends in India, and of reasonable critics here andin America.The Prime Minister thought that it would be important, whenthe expansion of the Executive was announced, to base its justifica-tion on administrative needs, and to emphasise that the changes didnot, of course, provide any solution of the constitutional issue.In discussion, general agreement was expressed with themeasures proposed.India and theWar.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 272ndConclusions,Minute 11.)
The Minister of Labour and National Service asked whether arepresentative of labour could be put on the Advisory Council, andalso on the Executive. The Secretary of State for India said thathe had suggested to the Viceroy that there should be a representa-tive of organised labour on the War Advisory Council, but he doubted whether there was a labour representative suitable for inclusion on the Viceroy&apos;s Council. The Prime Minister suggestedthat the point made by the Minister of Labour should be put to theViceroy, provided that this did not involve any delay.The War Cabinet-Gave general approval to the scheme submitted forapproval by the Secretary of State for India in his memorandum (W.P. (G) (41) 53), subject to the points raised in discussion, and authorised him to inform theViceroy accordingly.Great George Street, S. W. 1,June 9, 1941.\

s^ri R K T 174COPY OF TELEGRAM RECEIVED PRQM THE PRIMS MINISTER.CANBERRA./X 3th June, 1941,/ IMMEDIATEaIt appears that intention is to hold Cyprus atW     least for time being.     It seems clear however that Chiefsof Staff in the United Kingdom place Cyprus as of lesserimportance than Western Desert and Syria and apparentlyno further troops, transport or equipment can be madeavailable for Cyprus,     Despite this Chiefs of Staff havedecreed &quot;Garrison must be retained to force enemy toundertake serious operations to capture it&quot; (Cyprus),You will of course appreciate what this means.Another forced evacuation, particularly if accompanied withgreat losses, will have serious effect on public opinion in America and elsewhere while in Australia there arecertain to be serious reactions v/hich may involve theGovernment,Concisely my view is that there are but two alternatives, either Cyprus is to be held - and to that end should be garrisoned by a sufficiently strong force - or,if such a force is not available then the enterpriseshould be abandoned.For   fluty    C*     3&quot; faO 4**^&apos; ?

I replied I would immediatelytelegraph it to London and in the meanwhile make no commentupon it.   He then said that it was milder than he had expected and was in his view intended to calm rather than inflame thesituation.    I again made no comment.    He then asked, me whether had telegraphed his communication about readiness of germans to withdraw aeroplanes from Syria,    I said that I had (see my telegram No. 837) but that I imagine the military operationshad already started before it arrived.   He agreed and addedthat communication was evidence of the fact that the Marshaldid not accept German interpretation of negotiation of armistice.   I said that if this was so it was regrettable thatthe Marshal had not publicly stated his disagreement.Ambassador throughout the interview showed no excitement.    see my immediately following telegram,,
