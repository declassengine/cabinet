Good results had, however, been obtained at Kiel and Hanover.Aircraft losses over Malta for the 22nd and 23rd March hadEnemy 14 destroyed.Ourselves 6 destroyed.The Prime Minister said that a meeting on Night Air Defenceheld that morning had been encouraging.Since the 20th March 10.000 tons of shipping had been sunk and 35,000 tons damaged.The German battle cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau hadbeen sighted by an aircraft from Ark Royal on the 20th March600 miles west-north-west of Cape Finisterre?&quot; Low visibility had,however, prevented night shadowing or attack by aircraft, and the battle cruisers had escaped. Details were given of the steps whichhad been taken to intercept these ships, if they were still at sea, andto prevent their escape if they had taken refuge in a Biscayan port.H.M. Ships Bonadventure and Griffin, after escorting a convoyinto Malta, had been slightly damaged by near-misses in the air attack on Malta on the previous morning. Of the ships convoyed,the City of Lincoln had received a direct hit, but her cargo had beenundamaged.  The Perthshire had also received damage.On the 23rd March H.M.S.

The Balkans. 2.   The War Cabinet were informed that, according to aYugoslavia. message just received from Belgrade, the Yugoslav Prime Minister(Previous and Foreign Minister were leaving that night for Vienna to signReference: a pact with Germany. The message did not indicate the form of w.M. (41) 30th the pact.Conclusions,Minute 5.)Announcement The War Cabinet were reminded that no official announcementof arrival of had been made that any of our troops had landed in Greece. TheImperial Forces knowledge that our men were already in Greece might strengthenm Greece.        the hands of our friends in Yugoslavia.The Prime Minister said that the case in favour of anannouncement was very strong. But it had been agreed that thedecision when to make the announcement should be taken by theauthorities in the Middle East. The decision must be left to theForeign Secretary, who was playing our hand with great skill.The War Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to telegraph to the foreign secretary suggesting that an announcement of the landing of our troops in Greece might influence opinion in Yugo-slavia, but leaving the final decision to the foreign secretary.Spain.Anglo-Spanisheconomicnegotiations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 23rdConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to telegrams nos. 489, 505 and 506 from Madrid. These telegrams reportedrumours that the Spanish Government might intend to sabotage theplan for Anglo-American collaboration in economic assistance forSpain. The Minister of Commerce, at a meeting with representa-tives from various parts of Spain, had thrown out hints that therewould soon be a total blockade in the Mediterranean, and that thereafter no imports would be possible except from Italy andGermany.It was suggested that the true position might be that theGermans were threatening Spain if she entered into an economicagreement with us. While the position was obscure, it seemed tohave deteriorated.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (41.) 30thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Secretary of State for Home Affairs and Minister ofHome Security gave the following information : Night of the 19th/20th March. The casualties in london had been heavier than at first reported. The latest figures were : 504 killed; 1,511 injured.These casualties had been spread over a considerable area.It appeared that full use was not being made of Andersonshelters.Night of the 21st/22nd March. The casualties in the raidon Plymouth had been approximately as follows : Seriously slightly killed. Injured. Injured.150 230 250
Air policy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 280thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. In discussion of the preceding item, several Ministersreported that many people in this country believed that, althoughthe enemy was deliberately attacking the civil population aswitness the attacks on the business centres of many of our cities wewere still deliberately refraining from attacks on the Germancivilian population. No Minister suggested that we should alterour policy to the extent of ceasing to attack military objectives. Butit might be wise to take steps to bring home to our people thatattacks such as those which we had carried out on Mannheim andHanover had already resulted in inflicting grave injury on the civilian population of those towns; and that as the strength of our bomber Force increased the civilian population of Germany wouldincreasingly feel the weight of our air attacks.The general view of the War Cabinet was that it was better that acts should speak louder than words in this matter. At thesame time, while no public or formal declaration of the position was called for, the Minister of Home Security might allow information to become known through the Regional Commissioners about theextent to which the civil population of Germany was feeling the weight of our air attacks and the broad principles on which our air policy was based.Eire.Future Policy.The question ofbase facilities.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 1stConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The War Cabinet bad before them Memoranda by theChiefs of Staff and by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(W.P. (41) 59 and 64).The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs urged that, while we should continue our policy of refusing the provision of com-modities on the basis of our own needs, we should avoid theimpression of deliberately subjecting the Southern Irish to pressure.The War Cabinet were informed of the various steps taken inpursuance of the policy decided on at the beginning of January.Thus only enough coal had been shipped to keep the Cork gasworksgoing, without any reserve stocks. No oil, fats, sugar or wheat werebeing allowed to Eire.A demand for ammonia, for use as fertilizer, had now been&apos;received, and it was suggested that, as there was no special shortageof this form of fertilizer, a shipment should be allowed to proceed.The general view of the War Cabinet in discussion was that Weshould in no way relax our present policy of restricting the supply to Eire of commodities and shipping facilities. This policy was consistent with our own needs, and ostensibly it should continue tobe based on those needs. At the same time, it was important fromthe political point of view that the pressure on Eire should be fullymaintained. &quot;Fires had been serious. 6,000 houses were in need of repair and 1,200 beyond repair. 5,000 people were homeless.Accommodation had been provided in the Naval barracks, in neighbouring villages and in hostels.The raid had been very destructive in the centre of thetown; the damage to Naval establishments had been much lessheavy. The Navy had been of the greatest assistance to thetownspeople.Mr. Menzies said that he would communicate to the Minister ofHome Security certain impressions which he had formed as awitness of the raid on Plymouth.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
Mr. Menzies said that the interviews which Mr. Willkie and colonel Donovan had had with Mr. de Valera had, no doubt, beenvaluable, but they had been confidential, and had not been followedby any public statement. He was trying to arrange an interview with Mr. de Valera, at which he intended to put forward a state-ment of views which had been accepted by his colleagues inAustralia. He thought it might be of assistance if this talk was to- be followed by some public statement of his views on the Eireposition.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff(W.P. (41) 59).(2) Agreed that we should continue to apply our present policyin regard to Eire.(3) Agreed that it would be desirable that Mr. Menzies shouldmake a public statement on the position in regard to eire after he had seen Mr. de Valera.Great George Street, S.W. 1,March 24, 1941.
- MOST SECRET -W.M. (41) 51st CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.84th, March, 1941.IS BATTLE OP THE PRIME MINISTER said that while the GermanE ATLANTIC.Battle Cruisers SCHARNHORST and GNEISENAU were at large in the Atlantic, every important convoy had to be escorted,by a big ship.   The situation was so tight that, when theMALAYA had been hit by a torpedo, the convoy which shewas escorting had had to be re-routed by Trinidad andIceland.   The demands of Malta and the Middle East for aircraft involved the use of aircraft carriers (whichwould be very valuable for reconnaissance) to transport aircraft to Takoradi.   All this meant that our Navalresources were stretched to their fullest extent.   TheHome Fleet was now dispersed, and no attempt was beingmade to assert our command of the North Sea.   Fortunatelyat the moment there were no indications of immediateinvasion, and the dispersed Naval units could be concen-trated in Home Waters within about a week.   On the creditside also were the facts that we had superior air power   in daylight, and a powerful Army at. home.   By the end of that week more than 1,000 heavy tanks should be available.While these aspects of the situation were undoubtedly)serious, there was no cause for alarm.Great George Street, S.W.1
