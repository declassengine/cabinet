Mr. Fraser, 1.   On behalf of the War Cabinet, the Prime MinisterPrime Minister welcomed Mr. Fraser, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, whoof New Zealand, would attend meetings of the War Cabinet while in this country.The Prime Minister paid a warm tribute to the heroism shown bythe New Zealand troops, and said he hoped that Mr. Fraser wouldgive him the full benefit of his counsel during his stay in thiscountry.The War Cabinet warmly endorsed the Prime Ministerswelcome to Mr. Fraser.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 60thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Aircraft Losses.Bombing ofindustrialtargets in the pas de Calais.naval operations.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.Bussia.2.   The Chiefs of Staff made the following reports in amplification-cation of Cabinet War Eoom Records Nos. 653-659 :-Summary of aircraft losses since the 16th June : Home Theatre Enemy 105 destroyed.34 probable.38 damaged.Our Own 29 fighters (8 pilots safe).23 bombers.5 Coastal Command.Overseas Theatre Enemy 31 destroyed.11 probable.7 damaged.Our Own 32 destroyed.7 damaged.The Chief of the A ir Staff said that there were indications that german fighters might refuse action if our daylight bombing attacksover Northern France were confined to aerodromes. Should ourdaylight attacks be extended to include factories in the bigindustrial towns in Northern France, which were engaged on themanufacture of war material that would be used against us ? If so,should the workers be warned by wireless and by leaflet of our intentions ?The Home Secretary suggested that as there were manyCommunists in this area mention might be made of the fact thatmunitions made by the French might be used against Soviet russians well as against ourselves.The War Cabinet-(1) Gave approval in principle to the daylight bombing ofindustrial targets in Northern France.(2) Invited the Chief of the Air Staff to submit his proposals in the first instance to the Prime Minister and foreign secretary.During the previous four days 5 merchant ships had been sunk by aircraft and 3 by mines, totalling 18,000 tons. Belated reportsof sinkings brought this total to 36,000. Two ships had been damaged, totalling 8,000 tons.No information had been received from the Russo-Germanfront. The Russian concentrations, which were thought to be complete, appeared to be too far forward.[22635]b 2
Scuttling.Rescue of crewsfrom ScuttledEnemyMerchant Ships.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 21stConclusions,Minute 1.)H.M.S. Kelly.3. After a short discussion, the War Cabinet invited the FirstLord of the Admiralty (1) To submit the considered views of the Board of admiralty on the question whether the time had not come to issue a statement to the effect that we should no longer rescuecrews which scuttled enemy merchant ships.(2) To supply the Minister of Information with details of the machine-gunning in the water of the crew ofH.M.S. Kelly after she had been blown up in theMediterranean, with a view to publication.4. The Prime Minister said that it had been necessary to actquickly, following on Germany&apos;s attack on Russia on Sundaymorning. He hoped the War Cabinet would approve the line whichhe had taken in his broadcast the previous evening. The Debate on shipping matters, which had been due to take place on the following day, had been postponed. It had been arranged that the foreign secretary should make a statement on the position resulting fromGermany&apos;s attack on Russia.In discussion, the view was expressed that if, as seemed likelyto be the case, there was general agreement with the line that thePrime Minister had taken in his broadcast, a Debate would proveunnecessary. Accordingly, the House would proceed after hearing the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement to take the Committee stage ofthe Supplementary Vote of Credit for War Expenditure.The War Cabinet-Concurred in this procedure, and agreed that a statement,similar to that made by the Foreign Secretary in the Houseof Commons, should be made in the House of Lords.U.S.S.R.german invasion.proposed statement inParliament.U.S.S.R. 5.   The War Cabinet discussed various matters arising out of(Previous the outbreak of war between Germany and Russia.Reference:W.M. (41) 61stConclusions,Minute 7.)(i) British Mili- The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Soviettary Mission to Government were ready to receive a British Military Mission,Moscow. provided that we accepted the principle of reciprocity.   This didnot mean that they wanted to send a Mission to us, but that they wanted to give help as well as to receive it.Discussion followed as to selection of the personnel of theMission. The Head of the Mission should be an outstandingpersonality as well as an officer of high rank. He need not himselfbe a technician, but he would have technicians from each of theFighting Services at his disposal.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Service ministers to consider, as a matter of urgency, the personnel of theBritish Military Mission to Moscow, and to report to thePrime Minister.(ii) Return of The War Cabinet thought that in the circumstances it was his Majesty&apos;? important that Sir Stafford Cripps should return to Moscow. HeAmbassador to   would probably go with the Military Mission.Moscow.
(iii) Attitudetowards theCommunistParty.(iv) The daily worker.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 5thConclusions,Minute 8.)The Prime Minister thought it was important that the labour members of the Cabinet, in any speeches which they might make,should continue to draw a line of demarcation between the tenetsof the Labour Party and those of Communism. (The Lord privy seal said that he was proposing to emphasise this in a broadcast onthe following evening.)The suggestion was made that a hint should be dropped asking that new instructions should be issued to members of the CommunistParty of Great Britain, who had adopted a consistently unhelpfulattitude since the beginning of the war.Strong objections were urged against this course.It was thought likely that new instructions would be sentwithout any initiative on our part, and consideration of thissuggestion was postponed for a few days to see how the situationdeveloped.The Home Secretary said that he might have to answer a Parlia-mentary question on the 26th June about the suppression of the daily Worker. He saw no reason to modify our attitude on thismatter, and the ban on the paper should continue.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of this state-ment.Finland.Position as aresult ofGerman-Soviethostilities.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadreceived a visit from the Finnish Minister, who had come, on instructions from the Finnish Government, to say that they did not regard themselves as belligerents. Although in a position of extreme difficulty, they would not take offensive action against russia, and were still in diplomatic relations with the SovietGovernment. They were prepared to make arrangements forreturning to this country the British volunteers now in Finland.The Foreign Secretary said that for the time being it seemedbest to await further developments.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.France.Sir RonaldCampbell &apos;s lastDespatch.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 59thConclusions,Minute 6.)Blockade.Sink at sightZone in theevent ofhostilities withthe vichy government.7. Further reference was made to Sir Ronald CampbelTsdespatch describing the last days of the French Government in paris and in Bordeaux. The Foreign Secretary said that he was cir-circulating this paper to the War Cabinet. As at present advised, hewas opposed to the publication of this despatch, which would leadto recriminations.8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (41) 134) outlining a proposalto declare a zone dangerous to shipping in the Western basin of theMediterranean in the event of hostilities with Vichy becominggeneral.The Prime Minister pointed out that in the last few daysPresident Roosevelt had taken a strong line in regard to the sinking of the S.S. Robin Moor by an enemy submarine.  We must not ignore
Home Defence. 9. The War Cabinet were informed that the Commander-in-Proposed Chief, Home Forces, was anxious to carry out a large-scale exerciseLondon Defence to test the plans for the defence of London against an airborneExercise. attack.   It was intended that the exercise should take place under conditions approximating as nearly as possible to an actual attack.Road traffic, but not rail traffic, would be stopped. Many workersmight be prevented from reaching their place of work, and business:would be seriously interrupted. While there were certain risks in holding such an exercise, importance was attached to it, since it was thought that many valuable lessons would be learned.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that plans should be prepared for a large-scaleexercise to test the defence of London against airborneattack, and that the Home Defence Committee should beasked to work out with the Departments concerned the detailed arrangements and implications on the Civil side.(2) Deferred a final decision as to whether the exercise shouldbe held until the implications could be more clearlyenvisaged in the light of the detailed preparationsreferred to in (1).Information and       10.   The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on a propaganda.      Minute by the Minister of State addressed to the Prime Minister onthis subject (W.P. (41) 137).The Prime Minister explained that the Debates on this subjectwere due to take place in both Houses of Parliament on Wednesday,the 25th June. A number of matters were in dispute in regard toour arrangements, and he had accordingly invited the Minister ofState to submit this Memorandum as a basis for discussion.Discussion centred mainly round the proposal in paragraph (3)that all contacts between newspapers and Government departments should be conducted through the Ministry of Information, and thatthe Public Relations Officers in the various Ministries should communicate through the Ministry, although the Ministry wouldhave no authority or discretion over the statements of ministers who were members of the War Cabinet.Objection was raised to this proposal on the following grounds(a) It was a reversion to the scheme which had been tried earlyin the war and had failed.(b) The Press would protest strongly against being cut out fromdirect contact with Government Departments.(c) It would prove cumbersome and would make for delay,since, on detailed points, reference would have to bemade to the Departments concerned.the attitude taken by the United States Government on thisquestion.The War Cabinet-Approved in principle the proposals in the First Lord&apos;sMemorandum, on the understanding (a) that they would only be adopted if hostilities with vichy became general; and(b) that he would consult with the Foreign Secretarybefore the proposed notice to neutral countries was issued.
Strong objection was also raised to the proposal that the service ministries should send their Chief Publicity Officers to the Ministryof Information.It was suggested that a basis for compromise might be found ina scheme whereby the Departments continued to have their ownPublicity Officers housed in their own premises, but an arrangement was made whereby the Departmental Publicity Officers worked inclose co-operation with the Ministry of Information, in order tobring about a unified Government propaganda effort. [At presentthe departmental publicity officers had their own Committee inde-pendent of the Ministry.] Such co-ordination, it was suggested,could exist alongside an arrangement whereby each Departmentretained responsibility for the issue of its own Communiques.The War Cabinet-Adjourned further consideration of this matter to a special meeting of the War Cabinet to be held at 12 noon on thefollowing day.Great George Street, S.W. 1,June 23, 1941.
