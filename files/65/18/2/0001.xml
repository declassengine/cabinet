The Prime Minister said that he had just seen the BelgianMinisters and the Belgian Ambassador, who had complained aboutthe arrangements for the Belgian Government in this countrycommunicating with the people of Belgium.

 hipping.The Shipping.Situation.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 21stConclusions,Minute 1.)(previous reference erence:W.M, (40) 274thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Prime Minister described the measures being taken toimprove the shipping situation. This was Jthe Battle of the atlantic, which must be fought out in the shipyards and the docks,and on the seas.Special steps were being taken to reduce the volume of merchantshipping awaiting repair. Above all, the offensive spirit must beretained in meeting the enemy&apos;s attacks on our merchant shipping.If resolutely tackled over the next four months, the position should show great improvement.The Minister of Labour and National Service outlined theresults of his meeting with representatives of the employers andworkpeople in the shipbuilding industry.In each of the shipbuilding areas a Committee of Control hadbeen established, comprising a flag officer, representatives of navaland merchant ship repairing and a labour supply officer.Arrange-ments were made to enable yards to be pooled, so as to economiselabour. Men would not be allowed to leave the shipbuilding industry. A guaranteed week had been established, with an obliga-tion on the men to turn up for work. Arrangements had been madeto enable local settlements to be reached on inter-changeabilitybetween trades. An Industrial Registration Order had been made,in order to get back into the industry those who had left it in thelast 15 years. The other Supply Departments had been asked tohelp in combing out men who could be spared for marine engineering.The Minister of Labour added that it would be helpful if someencouragement could be given to the shipowners, in order to ensurespeedy decisions on the managerial side. The shipowners wereworried about the post-war position. (This was confirmed by other ministers.) He suggested that the Prime Minister should seeLord Essendon or Lord Rotherwick on this matter.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the discussion and invited the Prime Ministerto see prominent leaders in the shipbuilding industry.(2) Agreed that if necessary the question of the sale of vessels,ordered by the Government, to shipowners who had lostvessels during the war, should again be considered by theWar Cabinet.United States ofAmerica.Lease of bases in british territory.(Previous.Beferenpe:W.M. (41) 14thConclusions,Minute p.)6. The War Cabinet were informed that a Motion had beenput down by Sir A. Southby, M.P., asking for a Debate in-secret session on the United States Bases. Mr. Stokes, MB., had also given notice that he intended to raise the matter on the Adjourn-ment; and some rather awkward references had been made to thismatter in the Press.The War Cabinet agreed as follows :-(1) It was most undesirable that this matter should bediscussed in the House of Commons, whether in open orSecret Session, until the Lease and Lend Bill had passed into law.(2) Approval was given to the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestionthat, if the request were pressed, time should be refusedfor a. discussion of this matter, whether in open or in secret Session, at the present time, without cause
123 M.M.23XM);(3) If the question were to be raised on the Adjournment, theonly course, would be tq-moye;,at once that the: HouseshoUjld go into. Secret Session,, and in Secret! Session torefuse ,any information on the ground.that airy, discus-sion was undesirable at the present time.(4) The Minister of Information should be invited to take measures to prevent publication of undesirable articles, on this matter in the Press.Blockade. 7.   The War Cabinet had before them copies of 1 telegramsFood Supplies    exchanged with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, on food to France.        supplies for,unoccupied france (W.P. (41) 47 and 48).(Previous Telegram No. 1170 to Lord Halifax set out the reasons why weReferences: should not allow food to be shipped to unoccupied France, andW.M. (40) 276th emphasised the unsatisfactory features of the Vichy scene.Conclusions, The Prime Minister thought we should adhere to our policy of minute 6, and not relaxing our blockade of Vichy-controlled territories, except in w.M. (41) llth so far as we might be compelled to make concessions by the force of conclusions, public opinion in America.  All such concessions should be confinedMinute 3.) to the minimum.This view met with general approval.Attention was drawn to. the fact that two ships were nowbelieved to be in New York, either loaded with, or ready to load,wheat and maize for France. If we were to obtain the co-operationof the United States in economic help for Spain, the U.S. Govern-ment would almost certainly require a definite answer from us inregard to these two ships.The War Cabinet&apos;s decisions were as follows: (1) Our general attitude should be to continue to maintain theblockade of French territories under Vichy control, tothe maximum extent practicable.1(2) Should any concessions be necessary, they should be made inparticular cases, so as not to involve any breach in theI    blockade principle.(3) In regard to the two ships now in New York loaded with,or ready to load, wheat and maize for France, theForeign Office were invited to draft a reply, in conjunc-tion with the Ministry of Economic Warfare, for submission to the Prime Minister, on the following lines: (a) The political importance of helping Spain at this moment should be strongly emphasised.(6) We should invite attention to the views set out in telegram No. 1170, and strongly urge the UnitedStates Government not to force us to depart from the policy set out therein.(c) If the United States Government were to insist on a concession, it should be limited to the two ships in question.(d) Any concession made by us to the Vichy Governmentshould be made on a day-to-day basis, so as tomaintain our leverage; and we should make itclear that a continuance of concessions would depend on the Vichy Government taking some action of benefit to us.
Blockade.Interception ofescorted Frenchconvoys passing through the&apos; Straits of gibraltar.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 4thConclusions,Minute 3.)4 j ? connection with the previous minute the First Lord ofthe Admiralty asked whether further steps should be taken to intercept French merchant ships passing through the Straits of gibraltar. An opportunity of doing so might occur shortly.The War Cabinet Authorised the First Lord of the Admiralty to give instructions for the interception of French merchant shipspassing through the Straits of Gibraltar.
