Man Power. 1.   The War Cabinet had under consideration the following(Previous        memoranda on this subject: -wmTS 71st % the Prime Minister^W.P. (41) 258.Conclusions, By the Lord President of the Council-W.P. (41) 257 and minute 6.) &apos; L..P. (41) 172.; By the Minister of Supply-W.P. (G) (41) 115 and 118.By the Minister of Labour and National Service W.P.(41) 249.By   the   Minister  of   Aircraft   Production W.P. (G)(41) 119.Compulsory Discussion centred mainly round the problem of compulsory service for       service for women.Women. Power was already available to compel women by individual(Previous        direction to take specified employment in industry; the question for reference-        decision was whether the principle of compulsion should be extendedW M (41) 102nd to tne Services.  So far as the immediate future was concerned, theConclusions      problem arose mainly out of the failure to obtain, by voluntaryMinute 11)&apos;      recruitment, the numbers of women required for the A.T.S. though it was thought likely that the Civil Defence Services, and ata later stage the W.A.A.F., would find difficulty in meeting all their needs by voluntary recruitment.In view of the objections to applying compulsion to women, thefollowing alternatives were discussed : (a) Intensification of the recruiting campaign for the A.T.S.It was explained that a special effort on these lines had already beenmade. Publicity for the other Women&apos;s Services had been suspended,by agreement, for some weeks, in order that attention might be concentrated on the A.T.S. There had been some small improve-ment in the rate of recruiting, but the Minister of Labour and theSecretary of State for War were satisfied that the numbers requiredcould not be obtained by this means. The Minister of Informationsaid that his advisers took the same view.(6) Increased pressure on women registering under the NationalService Acts. It was suggested that Employment Exchanges did not make it sufficiently clear to women, on registering, that the powerto compel them to undertake specified employment in industry wouldbe exercised against them, unless they joined one of the Women&apos;services. The Minister of Labour said that, in his view, this formof indirect pressure was now being exercised to the fullest extentto which it was expedient to go. If it were carried further therewould be complaints of undue pressure and unfair discrimination between one woman and another.(c) Release of men from industry. It was suggested that, ifthe munitions industries were given large additional numbers ofwomen, they could release men, who could be taken into the Forces;and this would have the effect of reducing the numbers required forthe Women&apos;s Services. On the other hand, it was pointed out thatthe munitions industries themselves required large additionalnumbers of men and women; and it was considered unlikely that additional women could be drafted into these industries in such large numbers as would result in the release of any substantial number of men.(d) Employment of youths. About half the women requiredfor the A.T.S. were needed to man anti-aircraft batteries. ThePrime Minister asked whether some contribution could notbe made by youths between leaving school and being called upfor the Forces 1 Under present conditions, with little discipline andmany opportunities for earning high wages, boys of this age werein grave danger of becoming demoralised; and there was a strong case for requiring all these boys to undergo some form of training,as cadets, during this period. Exemptions would have to be madein favour of those continuing their education beyond the school-leaving age; and only part-time training could be exacted of thosewho had found useful employment on work of national importance[23137] B 2
It was reasonable, however, to expect that a considerable numberwould volunteer for full-time work with the anti-aircraft batteries,While it was agreed in principle that boys of this age should berequired to undergo training, as cadets, and that a proportion ofthese might volunteer for combatant duties on gun-sites, it was clearthat this expedient would not in itself meet the needs for which the compulsory recruitment of women was proposed.The Minister of Labour said that he had considered everypracticable alternative before deciding to support the principle of compulsion. He was satisfied, however, that no other method would now suffice. The numbers required had been announced, and theGovernment would be accused of having shirked this issue if theyfailed to secure them. There was a widespread feeling in thecountry that the Government should order the younger women togive their services where they were most needed; and many women were holding back on the basis that when they were wanted theywould be fetched. The time was ripe for the introduction of com-pulsion, and if this opportunity was missed it might be more diffi-cult to take this step at a later stage. He therefore favoured theintroduction of compulsory recruitment for the Women&apos;s Services onthe following conditions : (a) Compulsion should not apply to married women.(b) No woman should be posted to a combatant role unless shevolunteered to undertake it.(c) In  respect of exemption on  grounds of  conscientiousobjection, postponement on grounds of hardship anddeferment for women doing valuable work in reserved occupations, there should be the same safeguards as formen liable to be called up for military service.(d) There should be substantial improvement of living condi-tions in these Services&apos; e.g., separate lockers, betterwashing facilities, and other amenities.He had considered whether it would be sufficient to extend theexisting powers of direction so as to enable him to order an individual woman to join one of the Women&apos;? Services, in the same way as he could direct her into industrial employment. He was satisfied, however, that this would not meet the case, since it wouldbe necessary, in respect of compulsion for the Services, to apply the safeguards as regards conscientious objection, hardship, &amp;c.; and, ifit were once agreed that these safeguards should apply to a direction to enter the Auxiliary Services, it would be difficult to resist theclaim that the same procedure should apply in the case of directioninto industrial employment. He therefore recommended legislationempowering him to call up young women for these Services, by age groups, in much the same way as men were called up for militaryservice.The Secretary of State for A ir said that in his view the feeling among men in the Forces would not be met by an assurance that thiscompulsory system would not apply to married women. From the censorship of airmen&apos;s letters it appeared that there was a strong feeling against any compulsion of women, and he believed thatairmen would object strongly to sisters, daughters or sweetheartsbeing compelled to join the Women&apos;s Services. The Secretary ofState for War said there was no evidence that there would be anysuch feeling in the Army, certainly not against the compulsoryrecruitment of unmarried women. The First Lord of the A dmiraltybelieved that there would be strong opposition among men in theNavy to any application of compulsion to women. Further, hethought that difficulty might arise through the exercise of discrimination as between one woman and another one beingcompelled to join the Auxiliary Services at a relatively low rateof pay, while another was directed into a munitions industry where she would earn high wages.
Discussion followed on the question of defining the types ofcombatant service which women should not be required to under-take except as volunteers.The Secretary of State for Air suggested that it would be verydifficult to draw any distinction in this matter between service indifferent branches of the Auxiliary Services. Thus, many women in the W.A.A.F. were employed at stations which were liable to heavy air attack. They would be in just as much danger as women on the gun sites, and the opinion of men in the Services would be strongly opposed to compulsion being applied to women for eitherform of service.The general opinion of the War Cabinet was that the testshould be, not the danger to which the women were exposed, but thenature of the work which they were to undertake; and it was feltthat no difficulty would arise if the line was drawn in such a way that women were not called upon to undertake service which involvedparticipation in the use of lethal weapons unless they specificallyvolunteered therefor.After discussion the War Cabinet reached the following conclusions : I. New legislation should be introduced imposing on allpersons between the ages of 18 and 60 an obligation toundertake some form of national service.II. Within the framework of I, approval was given inprinciple to the introduction of legislation imposingcompulsory national service upon women, within age limits to be specified, for the purpose of obtainingsufficient women for service in the Auxiliary Servicesand for Civil Defence. This scheme should include thefollowing provisions : (a) That women, on being compulsorily recruited intothe Auxiliary Services or Civil Defence services,would receive the same protection and safeguardsas men subject to compulsory military service.(b) That married women would not be called up for these services.(c) That no women would be entered for combatantservice (i.e., service which involved participation in the use of lethal weapons) unless they specifically -cally volunteered therefor.(d) That, so far as practicable, women called up underthe scheme should be employed in the neighbour-hood of their homes.III. Legislation on the lines indicated in II should be intro-duced without further consultation with representativesof the political parties. But ample opportunity shouldbe allowed, during the passage of the Bill through parliament, for the formation and expression of opinion in regard to the scheme.IV. The application of compulsion would increase the need for improving living conditions in the Women&apos;s Services.V. General approval in principle was expressed for a schemewhereby all boys would be given training, from the time they left school (whether at 14/15 or later as in the case,e.g., of those receiving secondary education) until they became subject to compulsory national service, subject togenerous provision being made for further study. Thescheme should be devised so as to enable boys to volunteerat a suitable age for whole-time service with anti-aircraft batteries in the neighbourhood of their homes.
VI. A scheme on the lines indicated in V should be worked outby the Lord President&apos;s Committee, in consultation withthe President of the Board of Education and other ministers concerned.VII. The following conclusions were reached on the other proposals summarised in paragraph 13 of the Memo-randum by the Lord President (W.P. (41) 257): (a) Formal approval was given to the proposal toabandon the system of block reservation byoccupation, in favour of a system of individualdeferment, and to the machinery for carrying through the system of individual defermentsuggested in the Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour and National Service (W.P. (41) 249).(b) Young men should in future be called up at the ageof 18^ instead of 19.(c) The Air Force intake from the 1923 Class should belimited to 52,000.(d) The suggestion that the proposed intake into theArmy up to the 30th June, 1942, should be spreadover until the 30th September, 1942, was deferred for later consideration.(e) Approval was given in principle to the introductionof a system by which the labour requirements ofthe Supply Departments would be settled in thelight of the man-power position, so as to ensure a reasonable balance between the man-powerdemands of the Services and those of the indus-tries on which they rely for equipment.The Fighting 2.   The Prime Minister referred to the suggestion which heServices. had made to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that some arrange-Post-War ment should be introduced for Service personnel, comparable withCredits. the arrangement whereby part of the Income Tax paid by workmen(Previous in munition factories earning high wages was set aside as a post-Reference:       war credit.   There would be every advantage if Service personnelW.M. (41) 102nd had available to them after the war a credit equivalent to, say, theConclusions,      average credit available to munition workers.  A credit of, say,  30Minute 10.)      a head, for 5,000,000 personnel, would cost  150 millions.   Thiswas a large sum, but, if the State took the initiative in putting forward a scheme on these lines, it might well avoid more far-reaching claims.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the present schemefor post-war credits applied to all persons within certain incometax ranges, and already covered a proportion of Service personnel.A scheme on the lines proposed would have to be closely connectedwith other Service gratuities. The financial position after the warmust also be taken into account. He would, however, be ready togive consideration to a scheme on these lines.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security asked thatthe position of full-time workers in Civil Defence should be takeninto account in this connection.The War Cabinet-Appointed a Committee, consisting of The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman),The Minister without Portfolio,The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security,The President of the Board of Trade,to consider and report on a scheme for post-war credits for service personnel, and whole-time personnel of civil defence Services, on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister.

(41) 103rdConclusions,Minute 7.)Regulation 18b.Case ofLiversidge v.Anderson andAnother.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 91stConclusions,Minute 10.)4. The Home Secretary read the reply which he proposed togive to a Parliamentary Question by Mr. Mander, asking whetherpermission had now been granted to Mr. McGovern to visit Ireland.The War Cabinet-Approved the draft reply (see Appendix).5. The Prime Minister drew attention to the following question for answer on the following day : .Commander Bower-. To ask the Prime Minister whether,having regard to the grave constitutional issues raised by the judgment of the House of Lords in the case Liversidge v.Anderson and Another, he will introduce legislation to giveeffect to the interpretation of the wording of Regulation 18b,supported by Lord Atkin in his dissenting speech.He proposed to reply that His Majesty&apos;s Government had no intention of introducing such legislation at the present time. If he were pressed, he would add that the Government were anxious to surrender the special powers which Parliament had conferred upon them as soon as considerations of public safety permitted them todo so.The War Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to answer on the above lines.The Home Secretary informed the War Cabinet that he wasbeing subjected to criticism for keeping certain male internees andtheir wives in separate prisons. He undertook to circulate aMemorandum on this matter.The Press. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSmday Home Secretary (W.P. (41) 262) dealing with the articlerwhich hadPictorial appeared in the Sunday Pictorial on the 26th October.  The ClerkArticle. of the House of Commons had stated in a letter, of which a copy(Previous was attached to the Memorandum, that, if the question of privilegeReference: were raised, he would advise the Speaker that there was a primaW.M.

If it was so referred, it would not be easy to avoiddiscussion of certain difficult questions referred to in the article.&quot; On balance, he thought that the Government should not encourage a Private Member to raise the privilege issue.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury agreed with theviews expressed by the Attorney-General.The War Cabinet-Agreed that steps should not be taken to encourage aPrivate Member to raise the issue of privilege in regardto this article.
