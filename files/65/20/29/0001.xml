269W.BS. 137 (41).The Far East.unified command inSouth-western pacific.1. The War Cabinet had before them a telegram, Grey-No. 148, in regard to the unity of command in the South-west pacific. Several further telegrams (Grey Nos. 155-I59)*were read to the meeting.The War Cabinet, after a preliminary discussion, decided to adjourn consideration of these telegrams until 2-30 p.m. that afternoon. In the meantime, the proposals would be examined bythe Chief s of Staff.A telegram was despatched to Washington asking for urgentelucidation of one particular point (Taut No. 258).*The Allies.Proposed joint declaration.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 135thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The War Cabinet were informed of the contents of telegrams Nos. OOSO^and eOSl^rom Washington, giving the revisedtext of the Declaration.After discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) The Lord President of the Council was invited to despatch a telegram to Washington dealing with the followingpoints : (a) Great objection was felt to the Dominions figuringnot together, following the United Kingdom, butin alphabetical order among the signatory governments. It should be stated that the WarCabinet felt unable to assent to this arrangement,which would form a most unfortunate precedent.(b) Objection was also seen to the exclusion of Czecho-slovakia and the Free French from the proposedlist of signatories. Both had been represented atthe St. James&apos;s Palace meetings and had adhered to the Atlantic Charter.(c) Regret should also be expressed at the omission ofreference to social security.Position of India. The Prime Minister should beinformed that a telegram had now been receivedfrom the Viceroy to the effect that, in his view,India should be associated with the Declarationthrough his Council; that he would consult themembers of the Council individually, and would communicate as soon as he had ascertained theirviews.(2) Note was taken that, in the view of the Secretary of Statefor Burma, it would not be appropriate that Burmashould be a signatory to the Joint Declaration.id)Chemical 3. The Lord President of the Council informed the WarWarfare Cabinet that telegrams had been received from Washington (Grey/Previous Nos. 136 and 137/about a report from Berne that Hitler was reference- preparing an immediate large-scale distribution of gas. TheWM (41)68^ matter had been examined by the Joint Intelligence^CommitteeConciusionr who thought, that the report was undu y alarmist. The Chiefs ofmnute 4) Staff concurred in this view, and, having considered the counter-minute measures which would be necessary, had decided that it was undesirable to send out any warning telegram.The Minister of Home Security said that he had reviewed the civilian anti-gas precautions, and had reached the conclusion that,except for one or two minor matters, no special action was necessary.x
It was generally agreed that the suggestion in telegram Grey-No. 137 of broadcasts to Germany and Italy oh this matter was tobe deprecated.The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord President of the Council to reply to thePrime Ministers telegram on the above lines.AlliedGo-ordination.The Dominions.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 132ndConclusions,Minute 1.)4. Reference was made to the speech made by the AustralianPrime Minister reported in the Press in the previous day, in whichhe had stated that the Pacific struggle was one in which the UnitedStates of America and Australia must have the fullest say in thedirection of the Democracies&apos; fighting plan. The Secretary of Statefor Dominions said that the Labour Party in Australia had always taken rather an isolationist view and thought that theUnited States and Australia should be complementary to each other in the defence of the Pacific. The views expressed by Mr. Curtinrepresented those of his party only and had already caused strongreactions from other quarters. The Dominions Secretary addedthat, with the development of the war in the Pacific, he felt suretha^t it would be necessary, if friction was to be avoided, to give theDominions stronger representation in London in some form or another.The War Cabinet took note of the above.Timor.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 136thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Lord President of the Council reported that theAustralian Government had now agreed to our plan (see telegramNo. 2252^f the 28th December from Foreign Office to Lisbon) fordealing with the Portuguese Timor situation.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 136thConclusions,Minute 8.)Raid onNorwegianCoast.Air raid damage.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 136thConclusions,Minute 9.)6. The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that H.M.S.Kenya with four destroyers and two infantry assault ships had returned on previous day, after a successful operation on theNorwegian Coast. During this operation, which only lasted a few hours, our forces had destroyed enemy batteries and an industrialoil factory and had taken ninety prisoners, after inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. On the arrival of our forces, five enemy merchant ships had beached themselves and had been destroyed,and two armed trawlers and a tug had also been sunk. An enemyaerodrome had been bombed and four machines destroyed in the airfor the loss of ten of our own, including seven bombers. Onreturning home our force had been heavily bombed and some damage done to our ships. Naval casualties had been light. Other casualties had been two officers and fifteen men killed, and forty-eight officersand other ranks wounded. &apos;The report that the aircraft which had flown over Fairlight on christmas morning machine-gunning civilians had been Britishmachines had been investigated and found untrue.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Great George Street, S.W. 1,December 29, 1941.
W.M. (4l) 157TH CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE 1.(Confidential Record).The following were the main points dealt with in the course of preliminary discussions -(l)    Considerable doubt was felt as to the Joint Bodyproposed in paragraph (e) of telegram GREY No.148.V/as this &quot;body intended to &quot;be a political or amilitary &quot;body?   What countries were to berepresented on it?It was agreed that a telegram should hedes-oatched at once dealing with this matter,(See TAUT No. 258 and No.261).(2)   The War Cabinet were informed that there was an indication in GREY No. 251 that the Joint body would he in Washington.    It was difficult to see-exactly what functions this &quot;body would perform.Reference was made to the Permanent military representatives at Versailles in the last war.But doubt was expressed whether the analogy wasa sound one.(3)    THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that if there was aJoint Body set up to deal with a singlegeographical sphere, that &quot;body would necessarilymake demands which could not he met without an$/fiLte^&apos; effort on other theatres.    Who was to determine^ whether those demands should he met?(4)   A division of India fJ2om Burma was also criticised.(5-)   THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY feared theseproposals would &quot;have a serious effect on theDutch, who had criticised the lack of initiativeshown &quot;by the American naval forces.    The danger was a very real one, seeing that the japanese were probably offering a separate peace to the&apos;   &quot; Dutch,(6)    It was also pointed out that the sphere coveredby the unified command in the South-west Pacificwould cut across the line of naval communicatiohto Singapore.    In effect there would &quot;be an areaof unified command having on the one side of itan area in which the British Fleet would operate,and on the other side an area in which theUnited States Fleet would operate.    Would notdifficulties arise from the fact that the dividingline &quot;between the British sphere and the sphere ofthe South-western Pacific unified command would :occur at a vital point in the naval line ofcommunication to Singapore?   This seemed all themore to he deprecated, seeing that onee the land&quot;battle in Malaya had been stabilised, the war&apos; would assume a -predominantly naval aspect;; -

Netherlands Government have carefully studied notesaddressed by Portuguese Government on the 22nd December to Your.Excellency and to Netherlands Charge d&apos;Affaires at Lisbon andhave been struck by the difference between them.     It is notpossible for Netherlands Government to accept this differencem view of the fact that the landing of the force in PortugueseTimor was carried out in full agreement between the Netherlands,the United Kingdom and Australian Governments.     These Governmentsaccept responsibility individually as well as jointly.     (Note:Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs agreed in conversationto amend this passage to conform with line which we have followednamely that decision had been taken locally although it was fullyendorsed by 1he three Governments).2.     Absence of an attempt by Japanese to establish a baseafter December 17th does not prove that the danger of a Japaneseattack had not been very real before that date.     Japanese naval forces were off the island and a base in Portuguese Timorwould have been of great value to Japan.     Since the landing ofthe force? this danger both for Portugal and for the Allies hadbeen eliminated.take this step whicconsiderations. TGovernment to see t3.     Netherlands Government reiterates extreme regret withwhich they felt compelled in collaboration with their Allies toi was dictated by imperative militaryley share the desire of the Portuguesehe force withdrawn as soon as possible, but would be gravely neglecting their duty not only to Netherlandspeople but equally to their Allies in the common struggle against japanese aggression if withdrawal was agreed to before otheradequate measures had been taken to safeguard the colony.Netherlands Government are prepared to give favourable considerationto any suggestion which may offer a chance of giving satisfaction to the interested parties m this matter.4.    Netherlands Government hope that they will find inthe Portuguese Government the same degree of understanding of thedifficulties and dangers which threaten the Netherlands and her allies in the Far East.ClNDIV).
