The PrimeMinistersYisit to^the-United States.The Press.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 135thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. Further reference was made to the articles which had appeared in certain newspapers on Christmas Eve to the effect that german troops were massing for a move into Spain and that marshal petain had resigned. A telegram from Washington (No. 6029)showed that some irritation had been caused in the United states by the fact that credence had apparently been given in London tothese reports. A reply had been sent (telegram No. 7245) to washington explaining the circumstances in which these reports,which had arrived in the early hours of the morning, had been givenprominence by certain newspapers.The two main points made in discussion were: first, that itwould be desirable that the Editors should again be reminded thatit was contrary to the public interest that prominence should begiven to rumours of this kind; secondly, that consideration shouldbe given to the question whether the mechanism could be improvedfor giving guidance to the Press in regard to reports which were received very shortly before the papers went to press.The Lord Privy Seal undertook to take up these pointswith the Ministry of Information.The Prime 3.   The Lord Privy Seal read a Christmas message from theMinister of Prime Minister of New Zealand to the Prime Minister and the WarNew Zealand.    Cabinet.   The Prime Minister would no doubt send a personalreplyj but he thought that a message should also be sent from theWar Cabinet as a whole.The War Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to despatch a message in theirname.Timor. 4.   Attention was drawn to telegram No. 551 from the Prime(Previous Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia to the Prime minister reference- of New Zealand, repeated to the Secretary of State for DominionW.M. (41) 135th Affairs (No. 823). This telegram gave a wholly misleading and conclusions,      inaccurate account of events.Minute 2.) It was agreed that it was important that a strong reply shouldbe sent, pointing out how misleading was the account of eventscontained in this telegram. At the same time, it was probablybetter not to do this until the Australian Government has agreedto send troops to Timor to replace the Dutch portion of the jointAustralian-Dutch contingent. (A telegram on this, latter point hadbeen despatched immediately the consent of the Dutch PrimeMinister had been obtained.)The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord President of the Council and theSecretary of State, for Dominion Affairs to arrange fora suitable reply to be sent in due course to the telegramfrom the Australian Government referred to.[23282]b 2mmmimmmmmmmmum1. The Lord Privy Seal read to the War Cabinet a telegramfrom the Prime Minister (Grey No. 105) as to the probable lengthof his stay. The Prime Minister proposed to spend a day or two inCanada before returning to this country.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
St. Pierce and 5.   The Lord President of the Council reported that on theMiquelon. 24th December Free French naval forces under the command of admiral Muselier, and on instructions from General de Gaulle, hadrallied the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon to Free France. the vichy Governor had been arrested, and a plebiscite was being held that day of the inhabitants, who had received Admiral Muselierenthusiastically.This action was entirely contrary to the assurance given byGeneral de Gaulle that he would not put into operation the free french plan to rally these islands, since the United States Govern-ment was strongly opposed to Free French action in connexion withSt. Pierre. The Free French Commissioner for Foreign Affairs(M. Dejean), who had been summoned to the Foreign Office, hadadmitted that General de Gaulle had given orders for the operation to be effected. The excuse given, namely, that General de Gaulle,when he gave his assurance, had been unaware of the canadian government^ intention, with the approval of the United StatesGovernment, to send personnel to take control of the wireless stationby peaceful means, was entirely beside the point. The matter hadbeen further complicated by a public announcement by Mr. Hull tothe effect that the United States and Canadian Governments were examining what steps could be taken to restore the status quo in the islands.  Any such action seemed to be out of the question.The War Cabinet (a) Invited the Lord President of the Council to send forGeneral de Gaulle and inform him that his conduct inthis matter could not be tolerated, and had placed us ina position of great embarrassment.(b) Invited the Lord President of the Council to ensure thatthe Prime Minister was acquainted with the full facts of the position, and to ask him to discuss the position with President Roosevelt and Mr. Mackenzie King, who^was expected to arrive that day at Washington.(c) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to send a telegram to the Canadian Government, informing them of (6) above, and asking them to take no action in regardto any proposal to restore the status quo in the islands.U.S.S.R.Trade UnionDelegation.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 122ndConclusions,Minute 4.)6. Attention was drawn to telegram No. 53 Hectic reporting that the Soviet Trade Union Delegation to the United kingdom were travelling from Moscow with the Foreign Secretary. Thelatter asked that the necessary arrangements should be made fortheir accommodation on the train and their reception in London,and that Sir Walter Citrine should be informed.It was understood that the T.U.C. were acting as hosts to theSoviet Trade Union Delegation, but it was agreed that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should participate in the arrangements forthe Delegation^ reception.The War Cabinet^Asked the Foreign Office to arrange for the Secretary ofthe Government Hospitality Fund to get in touch with sir Walter Citrine, and to concert plans with him for the reception of the Delegation.
8.   The War Cabinet were given the following information : During an air attack on Rangoon on the 23rd December ten outof sixty Japanese bombers, escorted by fighters, had been shot down.A big German tanker, which had previously been hit, had again been attacked in Spanish territorial waters. The tanker had nowbeen beached.Air Operations.Naval Two tankers had been reported on fire in Haifa harbour on theOperations.       25th December.   The Ulysses, which had been reported lost, was now known to be safe.Reports during the previous few days had indicated an increasein our shipping losses.Military The Russians  reported that the  morale of  the  German.Operations. prisoners captured had been very low, and that operations wereU.S.S.R. proceeding favourably.Libya. Operations in Libya were proceeding satisfactorily, though itwas possible that what remained of the German force might escapethrough the gap at Agedabia. . Some 437 disabled enemy aircraft had been collected on various aerodromes during our advance.Up to the 26th December 4,300 German and 7,500 italian prisoners had been counted at Alexandria and in the base hospitals.Hong Kong. The garrison at Hong Kong had surrendered on the previous day.  It would seem that water supplies had been exhausted.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 134thConclusions,Minute 3.)The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Day of National 7. The Lord Privy Seal read a telegram which had beenPrayer, received from the Prime Minister reporting that the President of(Previous the United States had appointed the 1st January to be a Day ofReference: National Prayer in the United States, and suggesting that urgentW.M. (40) 237th consideration should be given, in consultation with the appropriateConclusions, authorities, to see whether it would not be desirable to make a minute 2.)        similar arrangement in the United Kingdom.It was pointed out that on previous occasions a Sunday hadnearly always been chosen as a Day of National Prayer. Further,there might be some difficulty in making the necessary arrangements at short notice.Nevertheless, the War Cabinet were in favour of the plan,provided that it proved generally acceptable to the religious leaders and was found practicable.The War Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary to consult with the religiousleaders in the course of the day, and to report the result to the Lord President of the Council, with a view to asubmission being made to The King that evening.If it was decided to appoint the 1st January as a Day ofNational Prayer in this country, the Dominion Govern-ments should be notified of the action taken.
Air Raid 9.   The Minister of Home Security stated that some thirty-nineDamage. enemy aircraft had operated against this country, mainly in the thames Estuary, on the previous night, six making a landfall. Afew incendiary bombs had been dropped at Walton-on-the-JNaze.At 9 - 45 a.m. on Christmas morning two aircraft had flown overFairlight, machine-gunning civilians.
