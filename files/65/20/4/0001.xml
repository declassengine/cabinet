Parliament. 1.   The Prime Minister said that he thought the Debate on the debate on the Address should be allowed to continue over Wednesday and address. Thursday, the 12th and 13th November, and also Tuesday andWednesday, the 18th and 19th November, if so desired. Thereshould be the fullest opportunity for the expression of views, butit would, of course, be necessary to move the House into secret session at once if airy dangerous topic was touched on. He hopedthat Ministers generally, and in particular the Foreign secretary and First Lord of the Admiralty, would find it possible to be on theFront Bench for a considerable time during the progress of the debate.The Prime Minister indicated some of the topics he proposedto refer to in his speech in the Debate on the Address. He did not propose to be drawn into discussion of strategical matters.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of this statement.Naval, Military 2.   The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in and Air amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 795-800 : *Operations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 109thConclusions,Minute 3.)Air Operations.Summary of aircraft losses since the 5th November : Home Theatre- Enemy 14 destroyed.9 probable.13 damaged.Our Own 24 fighters (3 pilots safe).52 bombers.7 Coastal Command aircraft.Overseas Theatre Enemy -10 destroyed.4 probable.4 damaged.Our Own -18 destroyed.18 damaged.In the last six days we had made 690 bomber sorties,compared with 237 sorties by the enemy against this country; ofwhich only 82 had penetrated inland.On the night of the 7th/8th November 400 bombers had been dispatched, of which 37 had been lost, mainly on account of weather conditions. The forecasts had been fairly good, although it hadbeen known that there was a strong wind. After the last forecasthad been received weather conditions had worsened. The wind hadshifted 35 degrees and had increased 10 m.p.h. in velocity. Therehad been cloud up to 18,000 feet, with heavy icing. As a result,fuel expenditure bad been heavy and many of our aircraft had goneoff their course on the return journey. It was possible that thisaccounted for most of the 37 casualties.Seventeen fighters had been lost in a sweep against a target atextreme range on the 8th November. A number of fighters had gotoff their course, and probably failed to return owing to a fuelshortage. ,[23142] b 2
naval operations.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.U.S.S.E.The Prime Minister said that instructions had several timesbeen given that attacks should not be pressed too hard if the weather was unfavourable. In battle, heavy losses must be faced; but it was undesirable to expose our aircraft to extreme hazards in the courseof routine operations. Clear instructions must be given to the commanders-in-Chief that in planning operations they should take into account the need to build up our Air Force so as to have a stronger force available in the Spring.The Prime Minister congratulated the Admiralty on thebrilliant action by H.M. Ships A urora, Penelope, Lively and Lanceagainst an Italian convoy during the night of the 8th/9th November.Aircraft from H.M. Auxiliary Aircraft-Carrier Audacity had brought down two Focke Wulf aircraft while escorting a convoy to gibraltar.  One of our aircraft had been shot down.During the previous six days 22,000 tons of shipping had beenreported sunk.  This figure included one belated report.The Russians appeared to have carried out a successful counter-attack on the Murmansk front, probably about six weeks ago. two German mountain divisions on this front had been relieved. TheGermans were negotiating for their withdrawal through Sweden.The Germans yesterday claimed the capture of Tikvin on the leningrad-Vologda Railway (250 miles from Vologda). They wereattacking Tula heavily from the north-west with armoured forma-tions. The Russians had concentrated reserves in this area and considered the situation was in hand. Nearly the whole of the crimea had been overrun except for Sevastopol and the KerchPeninsula.The general picture was heartening. The situation hadstabilised on the greater part of the Russian front. There was no indication of the Finnish forces ceasing to take part in active operations. The near future would probably see a further Germanattempt against Moscow and Rostov.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Far East.Co-operationwithNetherlandsGovernment.(previous reference:W.M.

After a short preliminary discussion, Lieutenant-general sir William Platt and Major-General Sir Philip Mitchell entered the meeting.  Discussion ensued as to our military interests.Lieutenant-General Sir William Platt said that the War Officewanted the road kept open through Ethiopia from Kenya to the red sea, as an alternative to the sea route. The Air Ministry also attached importance to the air facilities in the country and to themaintenance of a meteorological station at Addis Ababa. Theposition would, however, be greatly changed once the Italian force at Gondar had been captured and all the Italian civilians had been evacuated. If, at the same time, the British troops in Ethiopia wereto be removed, the maintenance of adequate communications withthe country would be a matter of relative indifference. Sir PhilipMitchell said that it would probably be necessary to leave 300 or400 Italians to run the railway. These would, however, stay of theirown accord, and would make their own terms with the Emperor.Removal of Italian civilians.Sir William Platt said that without the use of Jibuti theItalian civilians could be removed at the rate of about 1,000 a week.With the resources of Jibuti available a much higher rate could beachieved.The Prime Minister said that the present policy was to allow the blockade of Jibuti to continue for another month.Sir Philip Mitchell said that while the question was mainly amatter of transport, at the present time, however, destinations had only been found for some 14,000 of the Italian civilians.Dealing with the question of internal security, Sir PhilipMitchell said that the Emperor was now in a weak position. Thereason for this was that he was the only important leader in ethiopia who had not got an army of his own. It was necessary tocreate one for him, and steps to this end had been set on foot. TheEmperor was anxious to put an end to the feudal system of govern-ment, and to avoid undue reliance on the Rasses. He was still in dispute with Ras Sayoum. Given reasonable time to establishhimself, the Emperor should be able to maintain his position,provided that his local Governors did not commit atrocities on thesubject tribes, who were now armed.The discussion then turned on the terms of the draft a greement.The Lord President explained that the Agreement was based onthe instructions given to Sir Philip Mitchell after the meeting ofthe War Cabinet held on the 9th June last. The draft correctlyinterpreted the instructions given by the Cabinet, subject to theimportant qualification that in a number of respects Sir PhilipMitchell had felt bound to defer to arguments put forward by theEmperor that complete acceptance of the Cabinefs instructionswould make Ethiopia indistinguishable from a protectorate. Thedraft Agreement had been reported to the Committee under his chairmanship as in the main an agreed document between theForeign Office and the War Office, subject to certain outstanding points.The first ten Articles were read to the War Cabinet.   Theconclusion generally expressed was that some provisions of the draft agreement were more appropriate to a protectorate than fto,^anvindependent native State. . 7&apos; t&apos;0^^^^0(ip^f^^^4^^j^i% thought that our policy should, be defined as follows      .^x-iihiwio^jm &amp; - J^aoivv:)-sm (1) An endeavour1 should be made; to remove the Italian:JttS&amp;i)^^ as possible. Tt must
be assumed that the facilities of Jibuti would not beavailable for a month.   Thereafter endeavours shouldbe made to get them out of the country at the rate offive or six thousand a week.(2) All military rights must be retained until the Italian forcein Gondar had been captured, and the prisoners captured in this operation and the Italian civilians had been gotout of the country.(3) In the meantime we should proceed to help the Emperor tobuild up an army to enable him to maintain his position.We would also provide him with advisers who would be his servants.(4) An agreement should be signed with the Emperor as quickly as possible. This, however, should be on much simplerlines than the draft agreement, the provisions of whichhad been read to the War Cabinet.(5) We should undertake to make payments to the Emperor toenable him to maintain his position until the inter-national settlement at the end of the war.No doubt we should be able to use the power of thepurse to secure some of the objectives set out in the draft agreement which it was undesirable to provideexplicitly in that agreement. Some part of the paymentcould also be regarded as rent for, e.g., the air facilitieswe required.(6) We should make it clear that we did not propose to continuepaying a subsidy to Ethiopia after the internationalsettlement at the end of the war.(7) Diplomatic relations should be resumed as soon as possible,though it must be clearly understood that, whilemilitary operations continued, those relations would haveto be subject to special limitations. For example, theGeneral Officer Commanding-in-Chief must have directaccess to the Emperor.General agreement was expressed in the War Cabinet with this general policy.  The following points were made in regard to it:  (i) Sir Philip Mitchell said that he feared that it would takelonger than the Prime Minister contemplated to get theItalians out of the country. The Foreign Secretary saidthat he thought it was important that this period shouldnot be unduly delayed, as otherwise we should be facedwith trouble in Ethiopia.(ii) On the question of resuming diplomatic relations,Sir Philip Mitchell pointed out that the appointmentof a diplomatic representative at Addis Ababa at thepresent moment would present certain difficulties, sincethe problems with which he had been faced were mainlyadministrative. Considerable administrative workremained to be done before the Emperor would have an organisation which could stand on its own.It was agreed that this was a matter which wouldrequire special consideration.(Hi) The Chancellor of the Exchequer was anxious that it,,   should be provided.that the Exchequer assistance to the, &apos; s /      Emperor should take the form of a fixed,sum.The Lord President of the Council said that while a fixed subvention might be appropriate for part of thefield, there were-certain services which he thought wouldhave to be dealt with on a different basis in the early stages.
(iv) The Secretary of State for Dominion.Affairs said that itwas important to advise Field-Marshal Smuts in advanceof whatever decision was taken, for his position in SouthAfrica on this question was a difficult one. This wasthe more important, since the policy now decided uponmight appear at first sight to be somewhat inconsistent with that announced on the 6th February.The War Cabinet decided as follows :- I. general agreement was expressed with the policy outlined by the Prime Minister under heads (l)-(7) above.II. The Lord President of the Council was invited to arrangefor the draft agreement to be revised, as a matter of urgency, on the lines indicated in discussion. A repre-sentative of the Treasury should be associated for thesettlement of the financial articles.III. The Secretary of State for War was invited to convene a technical. Committee of representatives of the Depart-ments concerned: to- arrange a programme for the reception in appropriate countries of the Italiancivilians still in Ethiopia, and to put forward a schemeto enable them to be removed from the country as quickly as possible.IV. The Secretary for Dominion Affairs was invited to concert with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the termsof a telegram to Field-Marshal Smuts explaining theposition to him.Blockade.Interception ofFrench Convoyen route fromMadagascar.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 108thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theForeign Secretary (W.P. (41) 264) proposing that no specific com-munication should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom to the Vichy Government about these ships.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that he concurred inthis course. We had three different grounds on which we couldjustify the action taken; but if we made a statement at the presenttime we might weaken our case.The War Cabinet concurred in the course proposed by theForeign Secretary.The Minister of Economic Warfare reminded the War Cabinetthat a ship with 7,000 tons of rubber on board had put in toCasablanca.The question arose as to what action it would be allowable totake to intercept this cargo if an attempt was made to send part ofit to Metropolitan France by sea. Would it, for instance, beallowable to enter Spanish territorial waters for this purpose ?The Foreign Secretary thought that this course might exposeus to certain risks at the present time.The -Prime Minister proposed, and the War Cabinet agreed,that the matter was one which should be settled by discussion between the Ministers concerned.
War Cabinet 7.   The Prime Minister said that he proposed that in future arrangements, the usual arrangement would be that the Meeting of the WarCabinet on Monday would be attended, as at present, by WarCabinet Ministers and the other Ministers who normally attendedMeetings, together with the three Chiefs of Staff; but the Meetingon Thursday would be attended by War Cabinet Ministers onlyunless some matter arose which made it necessary to invite other ministers to attend. These would continue to be the two regular meetings of the War Cabinet, but other Meetings would, of course,be held as and when necessary. If the War Cabinet agreed, a detailed note would be circulated as to the revised arrangements.The War Cabinet approved the arrangements proposed.U.S.S.R. 8.   The War Cabinet were informed of certain communications between the Prime Minister and M. Stalin.A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Great George Street, S. W. 1,November 11, 1941.
