Regulation 18b.accommodation for Married.,Couples.(previous references:W.M. (41) 115thConclusions,Minute 5, andW.M. (41) 116thConclusions,Minute 5.)Detention ofMembers ofParliament.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 91stConclusions,Minute 10.)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary setting out the history of this matter and action proposed (W.P. (41) 279).The Home Secretary explained that it was proposed to make arrangements whereby the married couples detained under Regu-lation 18b should, where there was no Security objection, betransferred to a separate house in the camp at Port St. Mary, isle of Man.The Home Secretary said that, since his Memorandum had been written, further consideration had been given to the question of accommodation for the three married couples at present detained in prisons in this country (the number would be reduced to two whenLady Domvile was released). At present the men were detained atBrixton and the women at Holloway Prison.The Home Secretary outlined a scheme whereby these twomarried couples (and others who could not be transferred to the isle of Man) would be accommodated in a separate block of HollowayPrison, at one time designed to accommodate women undergoingpreventive detention. The inmates would have complete freedomof movement within the block itself. Details of the arrangements proposed were given.. The Prime Minister said that arrangements on these linesentirely met the view which he had expressed that married interneesshould be confined together, and that persons detained for political&apos;reasons should be better treated than ordinary prisoners. He was grateful to the Home Secretary for the trouble which he had takenin this matter.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the course of action proposed by the HomeSecretary in his Memorandum in regard to accommoda-tion for married couples detained under defence regulation 18b, as amplified by him in discussion.(2) Agreed that there was no need to refer to these arrange-ments in the forthcoming debate.The Attorney-General said that one point likely to be raised inthe forthcoming Debate was the detention under the Regulation ofMembers of Parliament. He thought it likely that the suggestion would be made that there should be some special safeguard in suchcases.The Attorney-General pointed out that, when CaptainRamsay, M.P., had been detained, the then Home Secretary had thought it right to inform the House of the upshot of the advicegiven in this case by the Advisory Committee. If the position ofM.P.&apos;s under the Regulation was strongly pressed, it might be forconsideration whether the Home Secretary should undertake that,in any case in which an M.P. was detained, he would inform theHouse of the recommendation of the Advisory Committee. It mustbe recognised, however, that, if in any case in which this procedurehad been adopted the Advisory Committee recommended release, itwould then be necessary to take the House into confidence, as, forexample, by agreeing that the matter should be considered by aCommittee of the House.Discussion showed that the general opinion of the War Cabinetdid not favour this suggestion, on the grounds that there was no satisfactory middle course between entrusting responsibility in thismatter to the Home Secretary or to a Committee of the House. Thereal safeguard was that the House had entrusted these powers tothe Home Secretary, and that the usual Parliamentary safeguardswere available to the House if they were ho^ satisfied with the way in which these powers were exercised. ;.Great George Street, S.W. 1,November 24, 1941.
