The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 126thConclusions,Minute 1.)The GeneralSituation.Middle East.Responsibilityfor the defenceof Burma.1. The War Cabinet had a discussion on the general militarysituation.The Prime Minister read a telegram from General Auchinleckreporting the favourable development of operations in Libya. our troops were now 40 miles West of Tobruk.The Prime Minister said that, at a Staff Conference over whichhe had presided on the previous night, it had been decided that thedefence of Burma should pass from the Commander-in-Chief, far east, to the Commander-in-Chief, India, as soon as arrangements to this end could be effected.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The Far East.Appointment ofMr. Duff Cooperas resident minister ofCabinet Rankat Singapore.Production.management of filling factories.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 77thConclusions,Minute 8.)2. The Prime Minister referred to telegrams which had been exchanged with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Thelatter would be Resident Minister of Cabinet rank at Singapore,and would perform functions similar to those performed byMr. Oliver Lyttelton at Cairo, but on a smaller scale. Mr. DuffCooper, unlike the Minister of State, would not be a member of theWar Cabinet, but would serve under, and report directly to, the WarCabinet. The detailed arrangements were set out in a memorandum which was being circulated to the War Cabinet that day (see.P. (G) (41) 152).The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of these arrangements.3. The Minister of Sup-ply informed the War Cabinet thatthe question had arisen how certain new filling factories, whichwould shortly be coming into operation, should be managed. Therewere already forty factories under R.O.F. management, and suitablepersonnel were not available to extend the system to furtherfactories. A scheme was therefore being worked out for puttingfive factories under the management of firms (such as Courtaulds,Lyons and Imperial Tobacco) which had available resources of skilled management and were accustomed to deal with large bodies of labour, but at the same time had no interest in the type ofbusiness concerned. Each firm would receive a fee of, say,  8,000per annum in lieu of overheads, and would not be able to pay a salary over  1,000 a year to persons employed in the management of these factories without the Minister&apos;s consent. The wholearrangement would be terminable at a month&apos;s notice, without anycompensation.In discussion, the view was generally expressed that anarrangement on these lines was fully justified on merits. At thesame time, there was a possibility that objection might be raised on political grounds, and it was important that the scheme (which hadnot yet reached the stage when any commitment had been enteredinto) should be presented in such a way as to bring out the realnature of the transaction.While no formal decision was recorded, the War cabinet favoured the adoption of the scheme on merits, and took note that discussions were proceeding between Ministers on the political aspects involved.Great George Street, S.W. 1,December 12, 1941.
116no otrculatiq:IQSL.WoM. (41) 187th CONCLUSIONS,,12th December. 1941.THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet atelegram which he had received from President Rooseveltthe previous morning, to the effect that while he (thePresident) could not leave America at the moment, he wouldbe glad to receive the Prime Minister at the White House.The Prime Minister said that he had decided to leave that night, and. gave particulars of the arrangements proposed for his journey.   He was taking with him the First sea lord, Sir John Dill (who had not yet vacated the officeof C.I.G.S. and whom he proposed, to leave behind as Headof the Mission) and the Chief of the Air Staff.   TheMinister of Supply was also accompanying him, to make sure that we obtained our proper allocation of supplies from the United States .   The Minister of Supply would, hethought, probably stay behind in the United States for ashort while after his (the Prime Minister&apos;s) return.It would be possible for him to keep in touch with theWar Cabinet by wireless throughout the journey.He thought that the United States and Great britain should make a solemn compact not to conclude a separate peace until the enemy had been defeated.   He would consult the War Cabinet on the draft of this document.As regards informing the Dominions, the PrimeMinister agreed that a message should be sent to them before he landed in Washington, but not, he thought, untilshortly before he arrived.   If there was risk of a leakagein this, country, the Minister of Information should tell the Editors in confidence, and get them to keep the newsout of the papers.   A WD&quot; Notice would, of course, beissued.

JRUSSIA. THE PRIME MINISTER said that tlie Foreign Secretaryvras due to land at Murmansk that day.   He had sent him atelegram to say that it was impossible to spare the tenextra squadrons for Russia.   Information received fromthe Russian front indicated that the German forces in front of Moscow were being cut to pieces and might wellsuffer a catastrophe.The Prime Minister said   that he had sent atelegram to Mr Eden giving him the views of the Chiefsof Staff as to whether Russia should be invited to declare war on Japan.   The upshot of the Chiefs of Staffs&apos; advicewas that it would be a great advantage if Russia shoulddeclare war on Japan, but that they should not do sountil they felt strong enough to take this action withoutimperilling the maintenance of their European front.PHE FAR EAST. THE PRIME MINISTER referred to re-arrangements which were being made in   the Far East.   The defence of burma was now to come under the Commander-in-chief, India,instead of the Commander-in-Chief, Far East.   arrangements would probably also be made to transfer Iraq and Persia,at a convenient opportunity, from the Commander-in-Chief,Far East,    to the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East.General Wavell would keep the 17th Division, whichit had been intended should be used in Iraq and Persia,while the 18th Division, which was now at Capetown, wouldbe diverted to Bombay and would be at General Wavell&apos;disposal for use in stiffening the Indian Divisions now on the Burma frontier.   Four squadrons of Fighters,which were now on their way to the Middle East, intended for use in the Caucasus, would also be diverted to India.The.Prime Minister said that it had been decidedsome time ago to relieve Air Chief Marshal Sir RobertBrooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief in the Far East, and

-     118  1General Sir Henry Pownall had been appointed in his place.The latter was now in Cairo.   The Chiefs of Staff had thought that it would be better to leave Air Chief MarshalBrooke-Popham in Command in the Par East, but since theyhad expressed this view a telegram had been received fromMr Duff Cooper asking when General Pownall would arrive.This was a matter which had not yet been finally deter-mined.   If General Pownall did not go to the Par East,he should be appointed to act as Chief of Staff to GeneralAuehinleck, in succession to General Smith.As regards the conduct of the war in the Par East,the Chief of the Naval Staff thought that we should dealwith the Naval situation by fighting an aircraft-carrierwar until such time as we could re-establish a Fleet inthe Far East.   It was also important to fight theJapanese hard, so that&apos; in place of, say, the 6 divisions which they intended to land, they would have to put onshore a force of 12 or 14 Divisions .   The maintenance of so large a.force would involve them in difficulties andmight well prove too big a   strain for their resources.As regards the loss of the PRINCE OF WALES and theREPULSE, the Admiralty had known that it was intended touse these ships to attack the Japanese forces landing onthe coast of Malaya, but they had not intervened to stop the operation. Possibly, however, the Admiralty had notbeen aware of the fact that Fighter coverwould not beavailable.The Prime Minister said that if there was a demand in the House of Commons for a discussion of the new war situation, it was essential that this should take placein Secret Session.    If there was strong criticism, thisshould be resolutely dealt with, and arrangements shouldbe made that a Labour critic should be answered by a

Labour Member, a Liberal critic by a Liberal, and so forth.   If Sir Roger Keyes made a nuisance of himselfI it would be appropriate that the First Lord of theAdmiralty should deal with him in an uncompromisingfashion.FRANCS. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought the timemight shortly come when we should say to the Vichy FrenchGovernment that if they would stand, with us in maintaining the independence and integrity of North Africa, we would do our best to restore their Empire.   But if they failedus at this point we would have nothing more to do withthem.   He proposed to take up this point with the UnitedStates Government.   A crisis on this matter might ariseduring his (the Prime Ministers) absence, and a decision might have to be taken whether to launch the Operation&quot;GYMNAST&quot;.   In this event, he hoped the United states would agree to put a force into Casablanca.   He wouldtake up this matter with the President during his visit.The Prime Minister said he would also ask president roosevelt to apply pressure to Eire.   The dominions secretary would be well advised not to attempt to reach ahasty settlement in his negotiations with Mr de Valera,but to report the matter back to the War Cabinet.   Thebasis of his discussions should be that if the eire government were prepared to declare war on Germany,there should be a period of a month during which we would do our best to bring their defences up to a level withours..     .     ofeat George Street, S.W.I.
