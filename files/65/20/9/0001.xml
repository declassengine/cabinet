France.Relations with vichy Govern-ment: north africa.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 44thConclusions,Minute 6.)Finland,Hungary and roumania.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 114thConclusions,Minute 2.)1, The War Cabinet were informed that news had beenreceived which indicated that Marshal Petain had been forced to abolish General Weygand&apos;s post as Deputy General in north africa.The discussion on the position and the conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded theWar Cabinet that, in connection with negotiations as to how to getFinland out of the war, we had explored the possibility of an american guarantee to Finland. But the United States Govern-ment had made it clear that they were unwilling to give such aguarantee.The Foreign Secretary suggested that we should now approach the Soviet Government with a suggestion that the greatest servicewe could do to them in this matter would be to get Finland out ofthe war; but, since the United States could not give a guarantee, we and the U.S.S.R. should join together in giving one. It would notbe possible to give any precise indication of Finland&apos;s boundaries,but we could guarantee the existence of an independent Finland.In discussion, it was agreed that it would be essential that any declaration on the lines suggested should be kept secret; otherwise,as the Prime Minister pointed out, the German forces might attack the Finns. The most likely way for hostilities between finland and Russia to end would be for fighting on this sector to die downgradually.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to ask M. Maisky toconsider a suggestion On the lines proposed.India. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report from theRelease of        Committee under the Chairmanship of the Lord Privy SealSatyagrahi (W.P. (41) 275).Detenus. On  the  Constitutional  issues  involved, the view of  the(Previous Committee was that the proposal of the Governor-General to reference.        proceed by way of advice to the Provincial Governors was wrong.W.M. (41) 115th       The Government of India Act, 1935, vested in the ProvincialConclusions,      Governments exclusive executive authority in relation to publicMinute 4.)       order, administration of justice, prisons, &amp;c.   Section 126a of theGovernment of India Act, enacted in 1939, had, however, increased the authority of the Central Government to the extent of enabling itto give directions to a Provincial Government as to the manner inwhich the latter&apos;s executive authority should be exercised if a proclamation of emergency is in operation.   While, therefore, theadministration of the law under which the Satyagrahi offences hadbeen dealt with was, like the administration of the ordinary criminal law, the exclusive function of the Provincial Executive, it was opento the Governor-General in Council, in dealing with an All-Indiamovement prejudicial to the efficient prosecution of the war, to give directions under Section 126a.The Committee&apos;s Report did not deal with the merits of thepolicy; recommended by the Governor-General in Council, namely,to release forthwith all persons convicted or detained for tokenoffences against the law.In discussion, the Prime Minister pointed out that Joshi&apos;motion had now been disposed of and that the Assembly had[23174] b 2
Parliament. 4.   The War Cabinet had before them-Offices or Places \  of Profit under W A summary of recommendations in the Report from thethe Crown Select Committee (W.P. (G) (41) 130).(2) A note prepared in the Treasury (W.P. (G) (41) 132).The second Memorandum dealt with the position which wouldresult from the expiry of the House of Commons (Temporary Pro-visions) Act, 1941, on the 6th March.  The question had been raisedadjourned until January. In the circumstances, he saw no need todeal with this question as a matter of great urgency, or for making any public announcement of policy, which would be unlikely to meet with any favourable response. He therefore thought that the best plan would be that the matter should be dealt with not by a formaldirection under Section 126a of the Government of India Act, butby a personal and private indication from the Governor-General tothe Governors of the Provinces, to the effect that it would be in thepublic interest if the process of releasing the Satyagrahi detenuscould be carried out as quickly as possible.This course met with general approval.The War Cabinefs decisions were as follows :  (1) The Secretary of State for India, should send a telegram tothe Governor-General on the following lines v- (a) The Constitutional position had been examined, andthe view taken was that the public announcementproposed by the Viceroy, which contemplated the giving of advice to the Provincial Governors onthis matter, was unconstitutional; and that theonly powers of the Governor-General in Councilin this mattter were to proceed by direction underSection 126a of the Government of India Act.(6) The War Cabinet saw no reason why the Govern-ment of India should proceed in this matter byway of a direction or of a formal public announce-ment.    They thought it would suffice if theGovernor-General were to send a personal and confidential message to the Provincial Governorsinforming them that, in his view (after discussionwith his Council), and in the view of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, it would be in the publicinterest to expedite the release of the Satyagrahidetenus who had, e.g., uttered prescribed slogans(including those who had accompanied them withspeeches not adding materially to their sub-stance); and that it was hoped that the releasemight be completed by the end of the year.(c) The War Cabinet also agreed that the sentences onPundit Nehru should be concurrent and not con-consectutive.   A public announcement to this effect should be made at a suitable opportunity.  Therewould be no objection to Nehru being releasedsome short while before his sentence had expiredin the normal course (after making allowance for good conduct remission), if this procedure was thought desirable by the Governor of the united provinces.   But the public announcement shouldnot include any reference to this point.(2) The Secretary of State was invited to submit the draft telegram to the Prime Minister.
Regulation 18 b. 5. The War Cabinet had a short discussion on this matter in(Previous view of the fact that this Regulation was to be debated in the HouseEeference:       on Wednesday, the 26th November, 1941.W.M. (41) 115th       The Home Secretary said that he thought the GovernmentConclusions,      should take its stand on the line that it was essential to retain them mute 5.)       existing powers, although the Government would not be backwardin coming to the House and giving back the exceptional powers conferred by it as soon as the situation permitted this.The Home Secretary said he had examined the suggestion whichhad been put forward in certain quarters that the inclusion in the regulation of the words &quot;if the Secretary of State has reasonable cause to believe &quot; had been regarded at the time the Regulationwas made as meaning that any person detained under the Regula-tion could call upon the Home Secretary to prove to a Court of Lawthat he had &quot; reasonable cause to believe.&quot; He was satisfied thatthe inclusion of these words had been due to no such purpose; and,moreover, that no grounds had been given which lent support to anysuch view.The Home Secretary added that he would have been gravelyhampered in the exercise of his duties if he had had to consider ineach case whether he could prove, to the satisfaction of a Courtof Law, that he had &quot; reasonable cause to believe.&quot;The War Cabinet-Endorsed the line of action proposed by the HomeSecretary.Great George Street, S. W. 1,November 20, 1941.whether provision for the continuance in force of  his Act shouldbe made in the usual Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he thought that thiscourse would not meet with approval in the House, and that it wouldbe desirable to deal with the immediate problem by a separateamending Bill and to announce this course when the Expiring laws continuance Act came before the House. General agreement was expressed with this view.The &quot;War Cabinet then had a short discussion on the SelectCommittee&apos;s recommendations for peace-time legislation and reached the conclusion that the matter would require furtherconsideration.The War Cabinet Appointed a Committee comprising The Minister without Portfolio,The Chancellor of the Exchequer, andThe Secretary, Department of Overseas Trade,with the following terms of reference: (a) To consider the recommendations in the Select Com-mittee&apos;s Report for dealing with the position of offices or places of profit under the Crown duringthe continuance of the present war, and to make proposals for amending legislation.(b) To consider and report on the proposals for normal peace-time legislation contained in the Report of theSelect Committee.
