The Lord President of the&apos; Conncil saidthat he had just^ seen the Dutch Foreign Minister, whom he had informed that he^proposed to tell the Portuguese Government that any attempt to divide us from the Dutch was doomed to failure. The Portuguesemust not expect us to dissociate ourselves from what had been done at Timor. We were anxious to find a way, consistent with themilitary situation, to ease matters for the Portuguese Government,by showing them that the position was not static and that some change in occupying forces could be expected. Thus, we would be willing, if the Dutch agreed, to arrange for the Dutch troops to be withdrawn from Timor and replaced by the Australians, whichwould give us a homogeneous occupying force. Before proceeding with this plan, we should, of course, have to obtain the assent of theAustralian Government. The Dutch Foreign Minister had saidthat his Government would have no difficulty in agreeing to thesuggestion.It remained to be seen whether the Portuguese would accept this solution. It would, however, have this appeal to them: that,while we were their oldest Allies, the Dutch, having wrested a great part of their former Empire from them, were apt to be regarded asold enemies. We might, perhaps, also tell the Portuguese Govern-ment that, if they saw a difficulty in this suggestion, we should beprepared to consider some alternative provided that the essentialmilitary objects were safeguarded.The suggestion that a Portuguese Officer should be put in.nominal control of the Allied contingent was clearly impracticable.The War Cabinet approved in principle the suggestnMuat&quot; X &quot; and invited the Lord President of the Council toput it to the Portuguese Government, subject to thev  , necessary consultation with the Australian Government.The Press. ,Articles.; aboutGerman &apos;inten-tions in Spain.&apos;;yM -vans :(PreviousO, ft   .y i u s.&apos; r&apos;.;Ref^erice:   i &quot;W.M1 (41) 113thConclusions,&apos; &apos; &apos;Minute&apos;6.)&apos;,   to mxydVHi3.

THIS TELEGRAM WAS READ OUT BY THE LORD PRIVY seal to THE WAR CABINET AT THEIR MEETING ON Y/wednesday.24th. DECEMBER AT 5.0 P.M. (W. M. C 41) lS5th)FROM:SOUTH AFRICA   (H.C.)TOjD.O.(Received 1.5 p.m., 24.12.41.)MOST IMMEDIATEWo. 1564.    MOST SECRET HMD PERSONAL.Addressed to H.M. Ambassador, Washington, 690.Repeated to Secretary of State for Dominion Af&amp;rs.   No. 1564.Please give the following message which is of thehighest degree of secrecy and urgency to Mr, Churchill fromGeneral Smuts.    Begins.Your 1456.    I was thankful to receive yourextraordinary message and to hear that you were on your wayto Washington.   Never before has a great concerted plan ofaction been more necessary and I trust that it will eventuatefrom this Conference.   The Far East is now our centre of weakness and unless the Japanese movement is countered byvery large scale action, they may overrun the Pacific,obtain all the war resourcesthey require and the recovery ofthis vast area would be a most difficult and prolongedaffair.I hope that you will therefore impress on theUnited States government if necessary with brutalinsistence, that the only way of meeting this situation isto defeat the Japanese navy and that this honourable taskis first and foremost their duty.   With Britain&apos;s handsalready full in the Atlantic, with a German invasionthreatened,which may be the most serious and dangerousGerman effort of all, with Vichy&apos;s capital ships not unlikely to join those of Germany and Italy against theBritish Navy, it would be madness to send more Britishcapital ships to the Far East.   The American Navy in large and small ships, in aircraft carriers and aircraft, ismore than a match for the Japanese fleet and should seek it out and destroy it and stop all these convoys of japanese troops/

troops now being unopposed to the occupation ofPacific Islands.   It is no use making big plans for thefuture when it is the present which is all important.The plan to be worked out is not how to send small aidin doles of ships or aircraft or troops to Malaya orthe Philippines and elsewhere, but how to plant theAmerican fighting fleet opposite to that of Japan.This is (grp. omitted ? not) a case for Jellicoe, butWelson tactics and it is a role for powerful Americanfleet, leaving, if necessary, the Atlantic and otheroceans largely as a charge to Britain.   Once dieAmerican fleet is in the Far East, all these Japanesedepredations will automatically come to an end.   Ifyou can achieve this object your mission will havemade a decisive contribution to the early end of this war.
