The Far East.unified command in theSouth-western pacific.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 137thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The War Cabinet continued their discussion of telegramGrey No. 14^ in regard to unified command in the South-western pacific, and had before them a report by the Chiefs of Staff(W.P. (41) 307). an increase the course of discussion the following points were made :--(1) Doubts were expressed about various aspects of the scheme,but the Cabinet had only had an outline of the schemeand were without knowledge of the discussions whichhad led to it. Further, the Prime Minister and his advisers clearly strongly favoured the scheme, dis-cussions on which had already gone a long way. In thecircumstances, the War Cabinet decided that the right course was to accept the plan in principle, whilst making certain comments in detail.(2) The view was expressed that, so long as the plan for unified command was confined to the South-Western Pacific, theclaims of other vital theatres of war might thereby been dangered. It was emphasised that Germany was our main enemy and that the Pacific was not the maintheatre of war. It was essential that some machinery orsystem should be established to plan the strategy of thewar as a whole.(3) It was not easy to visualise the composition of the JointBody from which the Commander-in-Chief of theSouth-Western Pacific area would take orders (seeparagraph (e) of Grey No. 148). It was not clear whether this Joint Body would include political as wellas military representatives, and, if so, whether politicalrepresentatives of the Dominions and other countries would also be included. The Chiefs of Staff took theview that the military representatives on any such Bodymust be subordinate to the Chiefs of Staff.(4) It was also suggested that the interposition of the proposedJoint Body between the Commander-in-Chief and whatever Body was established for determining thegeneral strategy of the war might lead to duplicationand delay.(5) Some doubt was expressed as to the wisdom of a system ofgeographical areas, especially in its relation to our naval forces. The proposed South-Western Pacific area wouldnot include our own naval forces based on Indian Oceanports nor the United States Fleet based in the Pacific.Further, the dividing-line as drawn seemed to cut acrossthe vital naval supply line through the Indian Oceaninto Singapore.(6) There were strong reasons for including in the proposedarea Australia, which was the area&apos;s main supply base.In this event, New Zealand should also be included inthe area, since otherwise awkward questions would arise as to what body was responsible for its defence. On theother hand, it was considered that Burma should be excluded for the present, inasmuch as its main base wasIndia, and no offensive action was possible in that partof the theatre at the moment.(7) Importance was attached to making a substantive and not an acting appointment as Commander-in-Chief, India.The War Cabinet agreed as follows : (a) A telegram should be sent to the Prime Minister statingthat the War Cabinet accepted in principle the schemefor unified command in the South-Western Pacific, butadding the comments made in discussion.
S(6) This telegram should also enquire at what time president roosevelt proposed to approach the Dutch Governmentin regard to the scheme so that our approach to theDutch Government could be appropriately timed.(c) The telegrams from the Prime Minister to the PrimeMinisters of the Dominions and to General Wavell(Grey Nos. 156-159)t should be despatched forthwith,together with paragraph 1 of Grey No. 148.(d) The Dominions Secretary should communicate to the high commissioners the text of paragraph 1 of Grey No. 148,but not of the Prime Ministers telegrams to the PrimeMinisters of the Dominions.Great George Street, S.
