Blockade., . 1.   The Lord President of the Council referred to the appealsGreece., x       made by the Greek Prime Minister for food-stuffs for Greece.   It(Previous -       was reported that many deaths from starvation were occurring.  in reference:       the Foreign Office view, while it was essential to maintain theW;M. (41) 133rd principle that the enemy were responsible for feeding the peoplesConclusions,;    of the enemy-occupied territories, it would be right in the specialMinute 5.)       circumstances to connive at some arrangement whereby food-stuffs,especially wheat, were to find their way through the blockade intoGreece.   If no action was taken, he thought the result would bethat the whole future of the Greek people would be undermined,and their feelings towards this country would be poisoned.Greece was in a different position from other enemy-occupied territories, in that the Germans, having pillaged the country, had handed it over to the Italians. Whereas, therefore, in othercountries Germany had an interest in seeing that the administra-tion of the country continued, and was getting work out of the peoples she had overrun, in Greece she was adopting a completelycallous policy.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that the Foreign Officeattitude was a complete reversal of policy. He referred to atelegram of the 3rd December to Berne (No. 1788) in which theconclusion had been reached that it was impossible to allow foodthrough the blockade for Greece only. As recently as the18th December a letter had been sent from the Foreign Office to the archbishop of Canterbury taking the line that we could notfacilitate the despatch of wheat supplies from Turkey to Greece.No new facts had been adduced since these decisions had beenreached.The Minister also said that if we were to give help to Greece,to do it in a clandestine way would be attended by everydisadvantage. It would be necessary to deceive Parliament, andthe concession would have no propaganda value. Further, the secret certainly would not be kept for long.. . He also questioned whether the situation in Greece was quiteas bad as was represented by the Foreign Office. There was some evidence admittedly from German sources that the position was improving. He also thought that if we were to admit any infringe-ment of the blockade in order to send food-stuffs to Greece, it wouldin fact be impossible to deny similar treatment to the peoples ofother European countries overrun by the enemy.The Minister then mentioned three other ways of helping the greeks which had been under discussion with the Foreign Office.These were : (1)   The Turkish scheme, which consisted of buying food-stuffs for Greece inside the blockade.This scheme should be expanded. Financial helpwould be necessary, and it was to be hoped that theUnited States would help in this matter.(2) A child emigration scheme, now being studied by HisMajesty&apos;s Government, and in which the American red cross were interested.(3) A scheme to allow free and safe passage to Axis vesselscarrying food from Trieste ^oythe Black Sea, underappropriate safeguards.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that (3) presented certain difficulties to the Admiralty.  These would be investigated. 3As regards the proposal that we should connive at an evasion-of our blockade in regard to the import of food-stuffs, andparticularly wheat, into Greece, it was explained that at the presenttime we were sending between 70,000 and 100,000 tons of wheat&apos; to- the Middle East every month. Some small proportion of this&apos;amount was allowed to proceed from Egypt to Turkey, in Turkish
ships, but on the understanding that none of it was exported from turkey to enemy or enemy-occupied territories. These imports werenot Subject to a specific ration. (This procedure had not proved necessary in this case, but would be introduced at once if foundnecessary.) In effect, therefore, the proposal put forward by theForeign Office amounted to&apos; this: that we should agree to ahadditional, say, 8,000 tons of wheat per month being sent to theMiddle East and being passed on to Turkey in Turkish ships, andthat we should not take cognisance of any leakage of wheat from turkey into Greece.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusion was : (a) That the three schemes set out at &quot;X&quot; should beenergetically pursued, and all possible steps taken on thelines indicated;(&amp;) That the proposal that we should connive at the evasion ofour blockade in regard to imports of food-stuffs intoGreece, and particularly imports of wheat, was attendedwith very serious difficulties and should not be accepted.Bulgaria. 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (G) (41) 159) explaining that,although Bulgaria had declared war against this country and theUnited States on the 13th December, no official notification of thefact had yet been received. The Turkish Government would onthe whole prefer that we should not be at war with Bulgaria, butthey must now reconcile themselves to the fact that Bulgaria was anally of Germany. In the circumstances, the Lord Presidentproposed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should announce that they regarded a state of war as having existed with Bulgaria from the13th December, and should issue a notification accordingly in theLondon Gazette.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that hethought it would be undesirable to take this action until 48 hoursafter the Dominions had been informed.The Home Secretary said that the relatively small number ofBulgarian nationals in this country had already been dealt with, onbroadly the same basis as in the case of nationals of Finland,Hungary and Roumania.The War Cabinet :-(i) Invited the Secretary&apos;of State for Dominion Affairs toinform the Dominion Governments forthwith that it was proposed to issue an official notification of a state of warwith Bulgaria.(ii) Invited the Foreign Office to arrange for the issue of thisnotification after the Dominion Governments had had time to consider the communication referred to in (i).Naval, Militaryand air situation.(previousBteferenee:ViTiM. (41) 133rdConclusions,Semite 2.)Air Operations.3. The War Cabinet were given the following operationalinformation: *During the last 24 hours over 100 enemy aircraft had beenreported as having been destroyed by the Air Force and the Armyin the Middle East, largely by the latter on the ground.Reports on the previous day showed ithat the Gneisenau had left dry dock, but was still in Brest harbour.145 bombers had attacked targets on the previous night,including Brest.  One was missing and one had crashed on return.
Timor. 4.   The Lord President of the Council said that two or three(Previous days earlier it had seemed that the position which had arisen as aEeference:        result of Allied forces having landed on Portuguese Timor was.M. (41) 133rd clearing  up   satisfactorily.   The  previous   day,  however,   theConclusions,      Portuguese  Government  had  sent a message,  not  unlike  anMinute 5.)        ultimatum,   to  the  Netherlands   Government  asking   for  theimmediate withdrawal of their forces, and intimating that it wasimpossible to discuss matters on the basis that there should be nochange until the Portuguese force arrived in the island.  It was ofinterest that the force which the Portuguese were proposing to sendwas twice as strong as the force the Dutch and ourselves had sent.This move looked very like an attempt to drive a wedge betweenthe Dutch and ourselves. We had asked the Dutch Government notto send a hasty reply. It was clear that we could not acquiesce inany action which would let the Dutch down.One suggestion which had been made was that, pending the arrival of the Portuguese garrison, a Portuguese officer could be putin nominal command of the Dutch and Australian contingent.General agreement was expressed by the War Cabinet with theview that we and the Dutch must stand together on this matter.France.The position at Vichy.(previous kef erence:W.M. (41) 116thConclusions,Minute 1.)U.S.S.R.War cabinet arrangements.5. The War Cabinet were informed that no official confirma-tion had been received of the reports published in that morning&apos;press that Marshal Petain had resigned his post as head of the vichy State.6. The First Lord, of the Admiralty said that there was an impression in certain quarters that Russia &apos;s effort in the war wasbeing deliberately belittled in the Press and in the news, and thatthis might well give rise to a very dangerous situation.The general feeling was that what had been observed was no more than the natural tendency for prominence to be given to news from the Far East. It was agreed, however, that the point was onewhich ought to be carefully watched.The War Cabinet agreed : To meet on Friday, the 26th December, at 11 - 30 a.m.Great George Street, S.W.1,December 24* 1941.Naval  I Known shipping losses to date this month were 117,000 tons.Operations.

The garrison of Hong Kong was still holding out, although in a grave position.The War Cabinet took note of this information.
