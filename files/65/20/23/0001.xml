Home Guard. The War Cabinet again considered the principal new measures(Previous for the Home Guard, which it was proposed should be introducedReference: by Defence Regulations; and had before them (in addition to theW.M. (41)129th Papers considered at the previous Meeting) a Memorandum by theConclusions.)   Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (G) (41) 156).The main point dealt with in this Memorandum was thatrepresentations had been made that the Home Guard would greatlyresent a procedure whereby members who wished to resign from that force on its conversion from a voluntary to a compulsory basis shouldbe called upon to state their case before a civil Appeal Tribunal.The Lord Privy Seal explained that, in paragraph 2 of his memorandum, he had set out a new procedure and method of presentation to meet this point (the last sentence but one ofparagraph 2 should be amended by adding at the end, after thewords &quot;the right to resign,&quot; the words &quot;within a specified period&quot;). In the procedure now proposed emphasis was laid onthe fact that members of the Home Guard would have the right to resign in order that they might have their cases heard by a civilTribunal. He thought, therefore, that this plan was not open to the objection that it would stimulate the demand from Civil Defencey. personnel for a right to resign, seeing that it was a part of theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security&apos;s scheme that part-time Civil Defence personnel should have the right of appeal to aHardship Tribunal by any member who was refused leave to resign.In discussion, the view was expressed that the procedure proposed was rather a roundabout way of reaching the sameconclusion as had been reached by the War Cabinet on the previous night, and that a more direct method of approach to the problem was, on many grounds, preferable. On the other hand, it was explained that it was believed that the Home Guard attached greatimportance to members of that force, while still members of that body, not having their cases brought before a civil Tribunal. Onthe whole, it was felt that there was advantage in carrying out thechange from a voluntary to a compulsory basis by a method whichwould not arouse antagonism, provided it was clearly understoodthat, if a member of the Home Guard resigned and there was ashortage of men for the force in his area, then he was liable to bedirected by the Minister of Labour and National Service, after hehad resigned, to return to service in the Home Guard, subject to appeal to the Civil Tribunal.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that the formulaproposed by the Lord Privy Seal in paragraph 2 of his memorandum might require some amendment, seeing that theDefence Regulation would not be made until about a fortnight after his speech on the following day, and that, since members of the home guard now possessed the right to resign, they could do so at once.It was not, therefore, accurate to speak of &quot; giving &quot; members of theHome Guard the right to resign within a specified period, and theproposed formula would require some amendment.Subject to this point, the War Cabinet approved the general lines indicated in paragraph 2 of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Memo-randum.Age-limits for A discussion then ensued on the proposal in paragraphs 4 and 8Compulsory of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Memorandum that the age-limits for corn-Service in the pulsory service in the Home Guard should be 18 to 56. So far asHome Guard, statutory powers were concerned, it was not necessary to adhere tothe age-limits for whole-time compulsory service in the armed forces of the Crown (18 to 51), since power existed to direct to part-time service in the Armed Forces of the Crown without limit of age.In discussion, however, strong objection was raised to theproposal that the upper age-limit for compulsory service in the
Home Guard should be 56. It was pointed out that, when the age for whole-time compulsory service in the Armed Forces of theCrown had been raised to 51, it had been stated that the older menwithin this limit would be used for static and sedentary duties.Was it consistent with this to enrol men compulsorily in the home guard, in a combatant role, up to the age of 56 ? Further, was theState likely to get service of value from men between the ages of 51and 56 who were unwilling to volunteer for the Home Guard?The Minister of Labour and National Service explained thathe would be content with an upper age-limit of 51. He thought thathe could meet the demands of the Home Guard for additionalpersonnel, in districts in which a shortage existed, by giving theHome Guard some preference in regard to the younger men in those districts as compared with the Civil Defence Services.It was therefore agreed to substitute 51 for 56 as the upperage-limit for compulsory service in the Home Guard.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the general lines of the alternative procedure setout in paragraph 2 of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Memoran-dum (W.P. (G) (41) 156), and authorised the Secretaryof State for War to modify the draft White Paperaccordingly.(2) Confirmed the decision reached at the previous Meeting inregard to Civil Defence personnel.(3) Agreed that the age-limits for compulsory enrolment in theHome Guard should be 18 to 51, subject to the proviso that persons compulsorily enrolled in the Home Guardwould not be discharged on reaching the age of 51, but would be retained in the force until reaching the age of65, subject to the power of compassionate dischargebeing freely granted over the age of 51.     *Great George Street, S.
