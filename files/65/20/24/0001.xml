The full extent of the damage was not yet known.On the other hand, it seemed fairly clear that in the last two days at least four, or possibly five, U-boats had been destroyed inthe area West of Cape St. Vincent, with the loss of one Destroyer.The situation at Hong Kong was very serious. The Japanese had effected a landing on the N.E. corner of the island, and had made a deep penetration. It looked as though the island could not hold out much longer.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.U.S.S.R. 2.   The War Cabinet considered two telegrams dealing with(Previous the discussions now proceeding with the Soviet Government;Reference: A record of the discussion, and of the Conclusions reached,W.M.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs reported tothe War Cabinet on his talk the previous day with Mr. de Valera.The discussion had been friendly, but no progress had been made,though it was perhaps of some advantage to have re-establishedrelations. A record of the discussion would be circulated to theWar Cabinet.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, whenreporting his discussion to the Prime Minister, to inform him that, in their view, the matter was not one which called for immediate action.India. 4.   The Minister of Labour and National Service said that hethought there was some anxiety in this country about the positionin India, both from the point of view of defence and of the Consti-tutional issue. For example, was our policy calculated to get thefullest war effort from India? Ought we to be doing more to increasewar production in India ? He thought that the position might giverise to a demand for a discussion in Parliament at short notice, andthat it might therefore be desirable that the War Cabinet shouldhave a general discussion on the position at the first convenient opportunity.The War Cabinet took note of this suggestion.
237W.M. 131 (4.1).5. The Lord President of the Council reported the positionin regard to Portuguese Timor. Before Japan had entered thewar we had had discussions Avith the Portuguese Government onthe basis that, if an act of aggression was attempted againstPortuguese Timor, the Portuguese Government would ask us tocome in to give help in virtue of the alliance. Shortly after theoutbreak of war with Japan we offered immediate assistance, it being understood that this would be furnished by Dutch and australian troops, who would withdraw when the emergency waspast. The hope was expressed that the Portuguese Governmentwould accept and would instruct the Governor of Portuguese Timorto invite our assistance, or to acquiesce in its being sent if therewas no time for an invitation. The Portuguese government accepted the proposals and promised to send immediate instuctions in this sense. At their request our proposals were recorded inwriting in a memorandum to the Portuguese Ambassador on the15th December. This emphasised the fundamental change in thesituation brought about by the outbreak of war with Japan. the threat to Portuguese Timor must be regarded as imminent, and itwas essential for the Governor to be given wide latitude to ensurethat assistance was forthcoming in good time.That was the position until the night of 15th December, when we heard that, in consequence of. the activities of Japanesesubmarines in the vicinity of Timor, the authorities of theNetherlands East Indies and the Commonwealth Government had arranged to send officers to Portuguese Timor on the morning ofthe 17th, to be followed in two hours by a combined Australian and dutch force.It was difficult for us to disregard the views of those on the spot in the light of the great importance of Portuguese Timor, dueto its precarious situation in the battle area and the presence of enemy submarines. We tried, however, to ensure that longer time should be allowed for consultation between the officers and theGovernor, but owing to the difficulties of communication our action was not effective.We had at once informed the Portuguese Government and theUnited States Government of the position. The Portuguesereaction was described by our Ambassador as &apos;&apos; violently unfavour-able.&quot; They contended that our arrangement with them onlycovered the case of &quot;attack&quot; and not &quot;threat of attack&quot;; andthe Portuguese Prime Minister, in an interview with the ambassador, demanded an explanation of the circumstances inwhich this &apos;&apos; violation of Portuguese territory &apos;&apos; had occurred. ThePortuguese Ambassador in London had also asked to see the PrimeMinister.Continuing, the Lord President said that he thought the line that we had taken was the only possible one, namely, that were recognised that the Portuguese Government was entitled to protestvehemently against the action which had been taken. For our part,we regretted that it had been necessary to take this action, but wemust face the realities of the position. Matters would have beendifferent if Portugal had been able to put up an effective defence.We should, of course, be willing to withdraw at any time if Portugalwas in a position to defend this territory adequately and we would withdraw our forces when the situation made this possible.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement and agreed with the line ofaction taken.Great George Street, S. W. 1,December 19, 1941.
