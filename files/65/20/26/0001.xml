Ojl- I.   The War Cabinet had before them the Ninth Report of thePrevention of Committee&apos; presided over by the Paymaster-General, on PreventingOil from Oil from reaching Enemy Powers (W.P. (41) 300).reaching Enemy The Paymaster&quot;-General, in asking the War Cabinet to takeCountries. note of the conclusions in his Report, said that a number of detailed(Previous investigations had been carried out, which all led to the conclusionReference:        that Germany&apos;s oil position was now at a crucial stage.(41) 95th In regard to the importance of denying to the enemy the oilConclusions,      resources of the Northern Caucasus, the Paymaster-General saidMinute 9.)        that a telegram had been received that morning to the effect thatthe Russians thought that, in the present military situation, it was unnecessary that any further denial schemes should be carried out at the present time.As regards bombing attacks on German synthetic plants, the paymaster-General said that he appreciated the reasons why, inrecent months, few attacks on these targets had been made, but he felt sure that the Air Staff would keep these targets in mind in framing future bombing programmes.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Staffappreciated the importance of these targets, and would consider them with other targets when circumstances were suitable.The War Cabinet took note of the Report and of these statements.Naval, Military 2.

A homeward-bound convoy from gibraltar had been attacked several times, but three of the attackingsubmarines had been sunk; together with two Focke Wolfe aircraft.We had lost the Empire Audacity (an auxiliary aircraft-carrier,)and the destroyer Stanley.During the previous week 44,000 tons of shipping had been lost,including two vessels in the Pacific.75,000 tons of shipping had been reported sunk so far thismonth, but belated reports might bring this total, to 120,000 tons.,:In the Mediterranean we had lost the cruiser Neptune and a destroyer.At Hong Kong resistance continued. The Japanese assault had started on Thursday night with landings on the south-east coast.They had crossed the island by Saturday morning, leaving two ofthe three main features in our hands. A message had been received that afternoon to the effect that Chinese forces near Hong Konghad attacked the Japanese. Nevertheless, the position of our troopsin Hong Kong was very serious.In the Malay Peninsula the fighting had been less severe thanthe previous week, but on the Western Coast our forces wereretiring in face of strong enemy pressure. Victoria Point in theextreme south of Burma had been evacuated and installationssuccessfully destroyed.In Borneo and Sarawak the Japanese had made a landing onthe eastern part of the island. Our forces had previously been evacuated, having carried out the oil-fields denial scheme.In the Philippines a further landing by the enemy in force atDavao on the South Coast of Mindanao Island had been reported a week ago our object had been to drive the enemy from hisposition about Gazala and to prevent him stabilising on theMechili-Derna line. Our troops were pressing the pursuit, but thechief problem was the maintenance of our troops, who were now far ahead of their rail-heads.Reports from the Russian front showed that the Russiansretained the initiative and had made good progress in front ofLeningrad and Moscow.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Far East.MilitarySituation.Situation at hong Kong.3. The War Cabinet were given information as to the presentdispositions in the Far East and as to the recommendations whichthe Chiefs of Staff had made to the Defence Committee (Operations)in regard to the despatch of reinforcements to the Far East.(Details are given in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.)      &apos;The Lord Privy Seal read to the War Cabinet telegrams whichhad been exchanged with the Governor of Hong Kong as to theposition in the island.The War Cabinet took note of the above.  .Singapore. 4.   The War Cabinet were informed that the Chiefs of StaffProposed had recommended that steps should be taken to evacuate the bouchesEvacuation of inutiles from Singapore, a measure of compulsory evacuation beingCivilians.    -     desirable. &apos; ,     ,,At an inter-Departmental Meeting that morning it had beendecided to recommend that a telegram should be sent to theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster instructing him to evacuatebouches inutiles from Singapore, but (a) leaving it to his discretionhow this policy should be applied to civilian Europeans and non-Europeans who were not required to take any part, direct or indirect, in the defence of the area, and (6) drawing his attention
Blockade. 5.   The Lord President of the Council said that the PrimeGreece. Minister and1 the American Ambassador in London had received anappeal from the Greek Prime Minister for foodstuffs, to which itwas almost impossible to return a flat negative. It looked as though(while not admitting any break in the principle that the enemy were responsible for feeding the peoples of enemy occupied terri-tories) we might have to connive at a fairly large-scale evasion ofour blockade of Greece, particularly as regards imports of wheat.The distribution of these imports would be controlled by theInternational Red Cross; there would be little fear of their getting into the hands of the enemy. He was in communication on thismatter with the Minister of Economic Warfare, and asked for no decision that day.It was pointed out that, if our convoys from Australia Wereinterrupted, it might become impossible for us to give assistanceof this kind to other countries.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.6 The Lord President of the Council said that the VichvFrench authorities had already realised that, Owing to the with-drawal of vessels from the Red Sea, our blockade of Jibuti had now been weakened. The chances of obtaining bur requirementsby negotiation were therefore diminished!.&apos;he War Cabinet took note of this statement.Jibuti.(previous reference:W.M, (41) 115thConclusions,Minute 2.)to a statement made by the Governor of the Straits Settlements onthe 17th December that in any withdrawal of population there could be no distinction of race, and that no European civilian, maleor female, would be ordered to withdraw.The main points made in discussion were- (1) That it was most important to avoid racial discrimination.But this might not be easy, since Chinese and Malayanswould not be permitted to land in many countries.(2) That the only way of getting away any substantial proportion of the civil population would be if theavailable vessels were employed to take passengers toneighbouring ports in the Dutch East Indies and were immediately turned round again.The War Cabinet^-(i) Affirmed the principle that there must be no distinction of race in the evacuation of civilians from Malaya,(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to amend the draft telegram to the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, in the light of the discussion. In particularhe should suggest to the Chancellor that the only way in which any appreciable measure of evacuation couldbe effected would be if arrangements could be made for civilian evacuees to be landed in Dutch East Indianterritory.(iii) The Lord President of the Council was asked to arrangefor this suggestion to be mentioned to the Dutch ForeignMinister.(iv) The telegram to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancastershould inform him of the action taken under (iii) and invite him to discuss the matter with the local Nether-lands Authorities.
Air Policy.Christmas EveandChristmas Day.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 309thConclusions,Minute 3.)7.   After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that, while the Air Staff must, of course, retaindiscretion to act if necessary in any unforeseen emergency, our policy should be not to launch bombing attacks against targets in Germany or enemy-occupied territory on the Western Front,on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, say, from dusk on the24th December until after midnight on the night of the25th-26th December.This decision Would not, of course, in any way interfereWith the freedom of our air forces engaged in operations in theMedi terranean and Middle East, or Far Eastern theatres ofwar.No public announcement should be given of our intentions in this matter.U.S.S.R. 8.   The War Cabinet were given the latest information in(Previous regard to the Moscow discussions.Reference:W.M. (41) 131stConclusions,Minute 2.)Production 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theManagement of  Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Supply (W.P. (G) (41)Pilling 157).Factories. This Memorandum stated that, in view of the strain imposed(Previous on the Royal Ordnance Factory organisation by its tremendousReference: expansion since the war, it was proposed that five filling factoriesW.M. (41) 127th now approaching completion should be entrusted to CommercialConclusions, firms to manage as Agents.  Under the terms proposed, the AgentMinute 3.) would receive : (a) A fee for management purposes.(b) Repayment of actual costs incurred, which would not include any overhead expenses.The War Cabinet were informed that the firms concerned mightwell consent to forgo the management fee, which it was intendedshould be about  6,000 a year, and which was not a materialinducement to them.In discussion, the following arguments were put forwardagainst the adoption of the scheme proposed : First, it would be urged that the scheme envisagedtreating the managements of large firms differently from theway in which individual citizens were dealt with under thescheme Of compulsory National Service. It would be asked whythe staffs Which it was proposed should be sent by the firms con-cerned to manage these filling factories should not be so&apos;&apos; directed &apos;&apos; under the normal procedure.Secondly, reference was made to the argument that thearrangement proposed would give to the Department nof merely the services of trained staffs in a managerial capacity, but alsothe experience of a complete Working organisation With areputation to maintain. It was contended that this argumentignored the fact that the experience required in this iMtterwas the specialised experience of filling factories, aiid hot thegeneral business experience which these firms possessed. Whyeould not the Ministry of Supply take into their direct empioy-ment, from the firms concerned, suitable managerial andsupervisory staffs, who would rely oh the centralised knowledgeof filling factories which the Ministry of Supply must possess I
War Cabinet 10.   The Lord Privy Seal proposed that the next Meeting ofArrangements, the War Cabinet should be held on Wednesday, the 24th December,at 11-30 a.m., and that, unless urgent business made it necessary,no Meeting of the War Cabinet should be held on Thursday, the25th December.This was approved.Great George Street, S. W. 1,December 22, 1941.The managerial staffs of those filling factories which were toremain under R.O.F. management would, in any event, haveto rely on the Ministry&apos;s central experience in this matter.It was also stated that suspicion of the whole agency arrange-ment had been aroused by the handing over to Beardmores of themanagement of the Dalmuir gun factory : first, because the negotia-tions had been carried out with the shop stewards; secondly,because it was believed that machine tools, the supply of which hadbeen refused to the factory while under R.O.F. management, hadbeen made available after the management had been transferred toBeardmores.On the other hand, it was pointed out that it would be much easier to get these five filling factories into operation quickly if theMinistry of Supply could rely, in the initial stages, upon the wholeorganisation of the firms concerned. These firms could call on theservices of any individuals among their own staffs, and could thusmake good at short notice any deficiencies. Furthermore, the firmswould be able to provide not merely the services of individuals, buta team which would work as such from the outset.This advantage, however, applied particularly in the initial stages. It was accordingly proposed that the arrangement suggestedby the Ministry of Supply should be applied for a limited periodonly, in order to facilitate the rapid organisation of these five filling factories on a satisfactory basis, and should be discontinuedthereafter, the managerial and supervisory staffs lent by the firms concerned then passing into the direct employment of the Ministry.The War Cabinet-Invited the Parliamentary Secretaries to the Ministry ofSupply, after discussion with representatives of the firms concerned, to put forward a revised scheme on the lines proposed at &quot; X &quot; above, which should be submitted to theWar Cabinet for their approval.

Your 1488 received. H.M.G. Greatly appreciate spirit of your message and splendid resistance of defenders. Following is full text of Prime Minister&apos;s message received prior to your 0521. Begins. We were greatly concerned to hear of the landings on Hong Kong Island which have been effected by the Japanese. We cannot judge from hero the conditions which rendered these landings possible or prevented effective counter attacks upon the intruders. There must however be no thought of surrender. Every part of the island must be fought and the enemy resisted with the utmost stubbornness.

The enemy should be compelled to expend the utmost life and equipment. There must be vigorous fighting in the inner defences and if the need be from house to house. Every day that you are able to maintain your resistance you help the allied cause all over the world, and by a prolonged resistance you and your men can win tho lasting honour which we are sure will be your due. The eyes of the world are upon you. We expect you to resist to the end. The honour of the Empire is in your hands. Ends. Shorter mesaage contained in last three sentences was suggested as alternative by Prime Minister if cypher message could not be sent. H.M.G. leave discretion in your hands when no further possibility of military resistance remains.
