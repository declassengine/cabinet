(41) 107thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. A convoy of five French merchant ships, which had sailed from Madagascar for France on the 24th October, had been inter -cepted by our naval forces south of Durban. None of the french ships had been scuttled. Three had been damaged, but all of them were being taken into South African ports.None of these ships was believed to contain the cargo of rubberwhich it was thought was being sent from Madagascar toCasablanca. It was thought that this ship might proceed to Manilato refuel.The War Cabinet-(a) Invited the Foreign Secretary to explain to the vichy government that, having regard to the course of actionwhich they were pursuing (as exemplified by, e.g., the carrying of rubber to Germany in French ships), we proposed to hold the five ships seized south of Durban.(b) Invited the Foreign Secretary to suggest to the UnitedStates Government that they might see fit to take some action in regard to the Vichy merchant vessel carrying a cargo of rubber if she put in to Manila to fuel.[23109]1. The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 789-792 : -Since the 30th October, in the Home Theatre we had destroyedseven bombers and damaged one enemy aircraft. Our losses amounted to seven fighters, ten bombers and two Coastal command aircraft. Overseas we had destroyed two enemy machines and damaged three, while our losses had been seven machines. In home waters fifteen enemy merchant vessels totalling 69,000 tons had been hit by aircraft, together with three smaller ones. Overseas, our aircraft had hit three merchant vessels. Seven submarines hadbeen sighted and two attacks made, one of which had beenpromising.Since the 30th October we had lost about 32,000 tons ofshipping.On the Finnish front there had been little change. In the leningrad sector there had been a German advance north-east fromthe bridgehead over the River Volkhov towards the Leningrad-Vologda Railway. Stout fighting by the Russians had stopped any german progress in the Kalinin sector. In the Central sector theGermans had made slight progress towards Moscow, both atVolokolamsk and Narofominsk&quot;, but the German armoured thrustto the outskirts of Tula had not made further progress. In theUkraine the Germans had reached the line of the River Donetz. Inthe Rostov area there had been no change. In the Crimea theGermans had made rapid progress and the threat to Sevastopol was serious.A Russian broadcast had referred to Roumanian and Finnishforces on the Moscow front. On the face of it, this seemedimprobable.The Foreign Secretary undertook to circulate a report whichhad been received from the Czech Military Attache in Russia.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (41) 254).The discussion on these matters, and the Conclusions reached,are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.6. A further discussion took place on aid to Russia. A record of the discussion, arid of the Conclusions reached, is contained inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.7. The Secretary of State for Burma said that he had shownU Saw the last two paragraphs of the draft letter appended toW.P. (G) (41) 122. U Saw had appeared to be greatly disappointed,and had asked whether he could submit amendments.. He (theSecretary of State) had said that he was prepared to consideramendments provided that they fell within the scope of the cabinet decisions on this matter. U Saw had then proceeded to submit aredraft, which was in effect equivalent to the proposal which he had made to Sir R. Dorman-Smith and which had already been rejected.He had informed U Saw that he was not prepared to submit this draft to the War Cabinet. TJ Saw was. now, he thought, preparedto acquiesce in the position, but hot without some protest which hehad already voiced to the Press.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
Finland,Hungary and roumania.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 106thConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The War Cabinet had before them the telegrams receivedfrom the Dominion Governments in reply to the telegrams sent tothem after the Meeting of the War Cabinet a week earlier(W.P. (41) 255).Whilst the Canadian and South African Governments were on balance opposed to declaring war on these three countries, theCommonwealth Government were in favour of it, and the NewZealand Government favoured declaring war on Hungary and roumania, but not on Finland. There was, however, a generalwillingness to leave the decision to His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom.The United States Government were reluctant to advise on thematter (telegram No. 4957 from Washington).There was no disagreement in the War Cabinet - as to the disadvantages of declaring war on these three countries and, inparticular, on Finland. Against this, however, must be set the encouragement which this course would give to Russia, and the factthat we had gone some way to lead the Russian Government tobelieve that if they pressed this course strongly we would adopt it.After discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) The Prime Minister was invited to include in the telegram to M. Stalin, which he proposed to send inregard to military aid to Russia (see Minute 6), a passage stressing the disadvantages which we sawin declaration of war on these countries; explaining that the Dominions did not altogether favour thiscourse; and inviting M. Stalin&apos;s views as to whether he still attached strong importance to it.(2) The Foreign Secretary was invited to informM. Maisky of the Prime Ministers message toM. Stalin after it had been despatched.(3) The Minister of Information was invited to takesuitable steps to discourage speculation in the Presson this matter.Regency Act,1937.proposed amendment.9. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the HomeSecretary and the Lord Chancellor (W.P. (41) 250 and 253).These Memoranda dealt with a proposal to amend the RegencyAct by a Defence Regulation so as to provide that, if the quorum ofthree out of five persons specified in the Act were not available to sign the declaration, their places as signatories could be made up bymembers of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.After discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) Objection was seen to the inclusion in the draft defence regulation of words referring to the hypothesis that the sovereign, by reason of enemy action, might not beavailable for the performance of the Royal duties.(2) The Regulation should be redrafted on the lines of thefollowing : &quot; Owing to war conditions, it is desirable toprovide that the panel of five persons specified inSection 2 (i) of the Regency Act shall be supple-mented by members of the Judicial Committee;subject to the proviso that, if any of the five personsspecified in the Act are available, they must form part of the quorum of three.&quot;(3) The revised draft Regulation should be held available, but should not be made unless and until information wasreceived showing that invasion was imminent.(
(4) If and when the Regulation was made, the Dominion PrimeMinisters should, if possible, be informed before it was published.Air Services.The middle east.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 29thConclusions,Minute 6.)10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (G) (41) 125).The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the provision of an adequate air service to theMiddle East was an important military interest, and accepted the proposals in the Memorandum in principle,as indicating the steps which ought to be taken with thisend in view.(2) Took note that, owing to Service conditions, great difficulty was anticipated in making aircraft available in the nearfuture to bring this service up to the standard proposed.(3) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary ofState for Air and the Minister of Aircraft production to examine with the Secretary of State for the colonies and the Postmaster-General what steps could be takento improve the air service to the Middle East, and by what date the improvements could be effected; and toreport to the War Cabinet.Australia. 11,   The suggestion of a visit to Australia by a Minister from(Previous this country was again referred to, but it was decided not to proceedEeference:        with it, for the time being at any rate.W.M.
