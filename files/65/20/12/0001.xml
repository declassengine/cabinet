(41) 110thConclusions,Minute 1, andW.M. (41) 114thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Prime Minister said that he had reached the conclusionthat the right plan would be that the Government should state theirpolicy clearly, and arrange for early passage through Parliamentof the Bill to give effect to it. He thought it was important thatthe Bill should, if possible, be passed into law before the christmas recess.General agreement was expressed with this view, which wouldinvolve the Bill being available to Members after the Debate onWednesday, the 3rd December, and the Second Reading being taken on Thursday, the 4th December.The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury pointed outthat, under the Rules of the House, the details of the proposed bill could not be discussed if the matter was raised on the Adjournment.It would therefore be necessary for the Government to table a simpleMotion. A draft was submitted and discussed.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that arrangements should be made for copies of theNational Service (No. 2) Bill to be available to the house on Tuesday, the 2nd December.(2) Authorised the Joint Parliamentary Secretary - to theTreasury to put down the following Motion :-V      J&quot; That, in the opinion of this House, for thepurpose of securing the maximum National effort in theconduct of the war and in Production, the obligation for national Service should be extended to include theresources of woman-power and man-power still available;and that the necessary legislation should be brought inforthwith.&quot;   v.:.&quot;&quot;. :l  .:: great George Street, S.

ort SECRET.HO CIRCULATION.HOUSE OP LORDS.Representationof the Labourparty.W.M.(4l)  119th CONCLUSIONS.(25th November. 1941.)Confidential Record.THE PRIME MINISTER said that some months ago the Lord Privy Seal had represented to him certain difficulties which arose as the result of the inadequate]representation of the Labour Party in the House ofLords.     Accordingly, it had been proposed that fournew Labour peers should be created.     The PrimeMinister mentioned the names of the four persons on whom it was proposed that peerages should be conferred.Their names had gti&amp; been submitted to the PoliticalHonours/committee and had been approved by that body.The proposal was that these peerages should be conferred, not as part of one of the normal kies^ss^Honours Lists, but on a separate occasion.      It wouldbe made clear that they were not political Honours,but were conferred as an act of State in order toensure the efficient working of the National coalition government in the Upper House.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL explained thedifficulties under which his Party had always sufferedowing to the absence of sufficient Labour representation in the House of Lords.     For various reasons, therewere not very many people in his Party who wereprepared to accept the honour of a peerage.     Manycould not afford it, or were unwilling to sacrificea career in the Lower House, while others (and this applied for example to one or two trade unionistswhose experience would have been of great value in theUpper House) thought the acceptance of a peeragewould place their children in an embarrassing position.In tnecdiscussion   which followed, generalagreement was expressed with the desirability of ensuring more adequate representation of the LabourParty in the House of Lords.     It was pointed out,however, that the creation of four Labour peers wouldbe likely to make it difficult to maintain the self-denying ordinance against the granting of politicalHonours in war-time.     While this did not apply to twoof the persons on whom it was suggested that peeragesshould be conferred, it was suggested that $Ms-pointswasilikely.; tiOob^jsI raised in regard to One, at least,of the other two cases.The suggestion that these four peeragesshould be included in the Honours List on the1st January was made.      THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said thathe could not agree to this.     These recommendations were put forward on the grounds- of obligation andpublic service, and it would give rise to difficulties for him if they were included in the ordinary List.After some further discussion, it was agreedthat the right plan would be that the prime minister should submit the four names, which he had mentioned

to the War Cabinet, forthwith to the King for the grantof peerages; &apos; and that if this course was approved, anannouncement ^should at once be made of the conferment ofthese four peerages in a separate list, accompanied oy astatement as to the reasons for this measure.If it was found that the creation of these fourpeerages resuItM in strong pressure for the grant ofpeerages to members of the Conservative and LiteralParties, then consideration might he given to theinclusion in the January list   submitted to His Majesty^of a recommendation to confer say two peerages on membersof the Conservative party and one on a member of theLiheral party.Great George Street, S.W.1.
