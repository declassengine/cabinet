The War Cabinet had before them (a) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War(W.P. (G) (41) 150) covering a draft White Paper on theprincipal new measures for the Home Guard, which itwas proposed should be made by Defence regulations under the National Service (No. 2) Act, 1941.(b) A Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security (W.P. (G) (41) 151), dealing with the reaction of the measures proposed for the Home Guard on existing part-time Civil Defence workers.The main point made in discussion was the proposal that,notwithstanding the proposal to exercise compulsory powers ofenrolment in certain areas, serving members of the Home Guardshould be given an option to withdraw before a. stipulated date.The Secretary of State for War said that it was most desirableto take this course before turning over from a voluntary to a compulsory basis. The present voluntary contract should be broughtto an end before new conditions of service were substituted. It wasnot believed that the offer to resign would be taken by many people.On the other hand, it was pointed out that it would be the dutyof the Minister of Labour and National Service to direct those whohad resigned from the Home Guard into some form of NationalService, and it would clearly be in the public interest that personswho had experience and training in the Home Guard shouldcontinue in that form of National Service. There would be gravedissatisfaction if a man who had exercised the option to resign was shortly afterwards directed by the Minister of Labour and NationalService to resume service in the Home Guard. The option was likelyto be illusory.It was also pointed out that the Minister of Labour and national Service had already made orders which had had the effectof &quot;freezing&quot; large numbers of people in their existingoccupations, although it would have been in the interest of many ofthem to undertake some other form of work.The general view of the War Cabinet was that this matter would best be dealt with, and the requirements of equity would bemet, if it was laid down that persons within the age of compulsory national Service, now serving in the Home Guard, would have tocontinue to serve in the Home Guard, subject to their being giventhe right to apply to resign and, if their application to resign wasnot granted, to have their cases heard by an Appeal Tribunal.The War Cabinet invited the Secretary of State for War toarrange for the draft White Paper (revised copies of which were handed round at the Meeting) to be amended, before presentation, inthe light of the discussion, and in particular in the followingpoints: (1) It should be provided that existing members of the home guard within the age of compulsory military service(18-51) must continue to serve in the Home Guard until their services were dispensed with or they reachedthe age of 51, subject to their being given the right toapply to resign from the Home Guard and, if their application was not granted, to have their cases heard by an Appeal Tribunal.The grounds of the appeal would be analogous tothose applicable in-the case of the Civil Defence Services,namely, that it was unreasonable to call upon them tocontinue to serve by reason of the work which they wereperforming or for reasons of health.The Home.Guard!.(PreviousEeierence:W.M.

Civil defence personnel.&quot;x&quot;(2) While the provision in regard to compulsory service in theHome Guard applied only to persons within the age-limits of compulsory national service, it would, of course,&apos;)be made clear that persons outside those age-limits were^tfree to continue in the service as heretofore. . WW(3) Prosecution-It was important that it should be provided 3that prosecutions should not be undertaken without /:proper consideration by the G.O.C.In further discussion certain points were raised, appropriate,not to incorporation in the White Paper, but to the Secretary ofState&apos;s speech in the House on the matter.The Lord Privy Seal said that some members of the home guard, who had served since its institution in areas where it was proposed to apply compulsory enrolment, feared that they would again have to go through&apos; the elementary training, which they hadalready completed, together with the new recruits. It would be aswell to dispel this fear.He also thought that there would be apprehension that in some areas applications to withdraw from the Home Guard (e.g., onchange of occupation) might be treated with undue laxity or withfavouritism and in others too strictly. Both possibilities must beguarded against.The Minister of Labour and National Service thought that itwould be possible to apply some variation to the procedure used fordealing with ordinary releases from the army, whereby the case was referred to the National Service Officer, who consulted theappropriate army authority.It was agreed that this system would provide a check. On theother hand, it was important that the system instituted should provide for speedy decisions where necessary.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for War and the Ministerof Labour and National Service to work out a scheme fordealing with applications for resignation from the home guard.The War Cabinet then considered the Memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (G) (41) 151).In paragraph 8 the Minister proposed that, concurrently withthe decision in regard to the Home Guard, he should be authorisedto announce that steps would be taken to &quot; freeze &quot; the existingpart-time Civil Defence personnel, subject to the right of appeal toa Tribunal by any member who was refused leave to resign by theofficer in charge of his Service.On the basis of the discussion on the Home Guard, it wassuggested that it might be necessary to modify the suggestion that&quot;the officer in charge of the Service should be given the right to allowofficers to resign. It was pointed out that the matter was compli-cated by the fact that the personnel of several of the Civil defence services were in the service of the Local Authorities. The matter was one which required further examination by the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security, in consultation with the Ministerof Labour and National Service and the Secretary of State for War.Subject  to  further examination of this point,  the WarCabinet -Approved the proposal in paragraph 8 of the HomeSecretary&apos;s Memorandum summarised at &quot;X&quot; above.Great George Street, S.W. 1,December 16, 1941.
