Spain.Action in spanish Terri-torial Waters.(previous reference :W.M. (41) 19thConclusions,Minute 10.)2. The First Sea Lord said that, with the Prime Ministersauthority, the Admiralty had issued orders to our patrols off thecoast of Spain in the following sense : *(a) Neither aircraft nor surface patrols were to cross the limits of Spanish Territorial Waters by day.(b) By night, surface patrols might enter Spanish territorial waters in unfrequented places, but aircraft were notto fly over them.(c) If our patrols were in contact with a U-boat, or the U-boat was actually in sight, both aircraft and surface vesselsmight cross the limits of Spanish Territorial Waters.The War Cabinet endorsed these instructions.Par East. 3.

The Prime Minister said that a request had been receivedfrom M. Maisky that a Soviet Trade Union Delegation, consistingof eleven persons, should visit this country. To provide a cruiserwould mean a detachment from our naval forces, while merchantvessels in convoy took three weeks.In the circumstances, the Prime Minister proposed to say thatthe difficulties of transporting the Delegation at the present momentwere very great, but that as soon as transportation became availablesuch a visit would be welcome.The War Cabinet agreed with the answer proposed.U.S.S.R.Visit of TradeUnion Delega-tion to thisCountry.(previous reference :W.M.

In answer to a question, the Chief of the Air StaffmaMthat steps were being taken to send out aircraft to the &quot;ranean in order to furnish supplies to the patriots in revolt.6. A further discussion took place, which is recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.7. The Secretary of State for the Dominions said that theCanadian and South African Governments had raised the questionwhether it was desirable that the Vichy Government shouldcontinue to be represented in Canada and South Africa. Publicopinion in both Dominions was very strongly in favour of breakingoff relations, though Mr. Mackenzie King said that, if the PrimeMinister still thought it desirable to keep the connection, he-was prepared to do so. General Smuts had taken the step of sending theFrench Minister on leave. &apos; :,rThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the VichyConsular representatives in Canada were actively hostile centres.Further, we had obtained no effective contacts with Petain through
199 W.M. 122 (41),the Dominion representatives at Vichy. To be effective, contacts with the Vichy Government would have to be through unofficialsources.The Prime Minister said that it was very easy to discontinue;this form of representation, but much harder to start it again.  He.thought it was desirable to see how things went in Libya before taking a decision.   He suggested that the Dominion secretary should telegraph in this sense to Mr. Mackenzie King and general smuts.The War Cabinet agreed to this suggestion.India. 8.   The War Cabinet had before them an exchange ofEelease of telegrams between the Prime Minister and the Governor-GeneralSatyagrahi relating to the release of the Satyagrahi detenus (W.P. (41) 293).Detenus. The Viceroy, in the telegram dated the 27th November, suggested^Previous an alternative draft for a public announcement in regard to the reference-       release, which he would do his best to get the Executive Council toW.M. (41) 118th accept.Conclusions, The War Cabinet minute 8.) ^ Agreed to the alternative draft announcement containedin the Viceroy5 s telegram to the Prime Minister, datedthe 27th November, subject to the omission of the words&quot; in consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; inthe second line, and the omission of the word &apos;&apos; now &apos;&apos;in the fifth line.(6) Invited the Secretary of State for India to inform theGovernor-General that the War Cabinet agreed to thedraft announcement as amended, and hoped that hewould persuade the Council to accept it.DiplomaticDocuments.proposed publication ofDocumentsillustratingnglo-german relations,1925 to 1939.9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (G) (41) 139) recom-mending the publication of documents giving a comprehensiveaccount of Anglo-German relations from 1925 to 1939, on thegrounds that this would both enlighten opinion for the Peace settle-ment and counter present German propaganda about the New order and the anti-Bolshevist crusade.In discussion, the question was raised whether the publicationof these documents at the present time might not revive old contro-versies, and thereby tend to weaken the war effort.The Foreign Secretary said that he had started with this pointof view, but had been convinced that the balance of advantage wasin favour of publication now. The Lord Chancellor said that thiswas his position also.The Prime Minister said that, while few people would read along publication of this kind, there was a risk that particulardocuments or passages would be torn from their contexts and usedto rake up past incidents. Further, it would be a great advantage if pubhcathm could take place after some successes of our armed forces. He thought it would be an advantage if some ministers could find time to read a proof of the documents and give the WarCabinet the benefit of their opinion. He hoped that the LordChancellor might be able to find time to do this.A

MO OIRCITLATIONTjTQST SECRET -W.M. (41.) .125th CONCLUSIONS.8th December, 194?..THE PRIME MINISTER said that he and the foreign secretary had considered whether the outbreak of war inthe Par East should interfere with the Foreign Secretary&apos;sjourney to Russia,- ana&quot; had. come to the conclusion that, onthe whole, it was important that the Foreign secretary should carry on with his journey.The Prime Minister added that, if his colleaguesapproved and. if this course was agreeable to president roosevelt, he proposed himself to pay a visit to the UnitedStates in the near future.   There were already indications that, the United States Naval authorities proposed to make-certain re-dispositions of their Naval   forces which wouldvitally affect us .   There was also a risk that they would wish to retain,for their own forces, munitions of war whichthey had promised to allocate to us.   Further, he thought itwas important that the war which we and. the United states would be waging together should be concerted at the highest level.   There, were also important issues involved affectingco-operation with Russia and the attitude towards VichyFrance.   He proposed that the Minister of Supply should accompany him, and   that the First Sea Lord should also bea member of the party.   He felt that, by a visit at this juncture, it would be in his power   to do considerableservice.   With his colleagues&apos; agreement he would propose toask the King&apos;s permission to go on this journey.The War Cabinet approved   the Prime Minister&apos;suggestion, and added that, in their view,, itwas of the utmost importance that the strictestsecrecy should be maintained in regard to arrangements for, and date of, the visit.
