GeneralMilitarySituation.(previous reference erence:W;M. (41) 125thConclusions,Minute 3.)- 1. The Prime Minister referred to the grievous loss which wehad sustained by the sinking of H.M.S. Prince of Wales afldfH.M.S. Repulse. sThe loss of these two ships; coming on the top of the disaster1which the Americans had sustained at Pearl Harbour, entirely;changed the balance of naval forces in the Pacific. Until theposition could be brought round, we should have to suffer considbr^able inconveniences; our shipping would be exposed td enemy attack, and we might have to take a lot of punishment in this area.There-Were Other important developments in the general war situation. First, the United States was now in the war with us.Secondly^ there Was no doubt that the German armies had suffered a serious defeat on the Russian front-a defeat which, if theRussians Were able to exploit it, might have very important conse-quences. Thirdly, so far as the battle in Libya was concerned, wecould now say that the tide had definitely turned in our favour andthat Tobruk had been relieved. These developments far outweighedthe immediate consequences of the position in the Far East, serious as they were.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to make a statement in Parliament on the general situation on the following day, in thecourse of Which he would announce the change which had been madein the Command of the Eighth Army in the Western Desert.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The Far East. 2.   Further discussion took place on certain aspects of the(Previous situation in the Far East, and is recorded in the Secretary&apos;reference:        Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.W.M. (41) 125thConclusions,Minute 1.)3 The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (41) 295) setting outthe conditions on which, in the view of the Ministers concerned,British approval might be given to a scheme for the transfer to theSpanish flag of 300,000 tons of French shipping now idle in theMediterranean. It was most unlikely that the Spanish and VichyFrench authorities would agree to all these conditions. the spaniards had, however, asked for our views, and a draft telegram to His Majesty1 s Ambassador at Madrid was annexed to theMemorandum.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the despatch of the draft telegram annexed toW.P. (41)295.(2) Authorised the Ministers concerned to agree to some measure of modification in the conditions proposed, attheir discretion, provided that they were fully satisfiedthat the resulting deal would be ih our interest;Shipping.Spanish pro-posal to acquire300,000 tons ofFrench ,shipping.[23251]
Parliament.Position ofM.P.&apos;s underthe NationalService Acts.(previous references:W.M. (39) 28thConclusions,Minute 12, andW.M. (40) 190thConclusions,&apos; &apos;Minute 3.) ,5. The War Cabinet were informed that the position ofMembers of Parliament under the National Service Acts had been raised in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he had informed the House that the position of M.P.&apos;s under the NationalService Bill (No. 2) was precisely the same as under the existing national Service Acts. He had been asked to give a firm under-taking that he would not use his powers to give directions to M.P.&apos;s.He had replied that he thought the matter should be dealt withindependently of this Bill (which did not change the position in thismatter) and should be raised with the Prime Minister. Two newClauses dealing with this matter had been put down and wouldprobably be discussed when consideration of the Bill was resumed in the House on the following day.The Prime Minister referred to the decisions on this matter which had been reached in the last war and at the beginning of thepresent war, and which had been reaffirmed rather more than a yearMan-Power. 4.   The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the LordCall-up of President of the Council (W.P. (G) (41) 147) and the Minister ofAgricultural Supply (W.P. (G) (41) 146).Workers. The question at issue was whether 7,000 agricultural workers(Previous should now be called up for service in the Armed Forces.   TheseReference: men formed part of a total of 22,000 men whom it had been agreedW.M. (41) 2lst should be taken from agriculture into the Services during 1941, butConclusions, whose call-up had been deferred.Minute 5.) In discussion, the following points were made : (i) The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries referred to thelarge number of men which agriculture had alreadycontributed to the Armed Forces. How could theindustry be expected to give increased production in1942 with fewer men ?(ii) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that Scottishagriculture was already short of 4,000 skilled men. Itwas impossible to make another 1,500 men available forthe forces and at the same time bring under cultivationanother 200,000 acres.(iii) The Minister of Labour and National Service asked theWar Cabinet not to disturb the balance of the man-power plan, which had been devised with great difficulty.Agriculture had retained more men under 25 than anyother industry in proportion to its numbers.(iv) The Prime Minister thought that the 7,000 men ought tobe called up. This was not a large contribution. but its withholding would expose the agricultural industryto reproach that it had held back its young men in thehour of their country&apos;s direst need.(v) Reference was made to the difficulties experienced in getting in the harvest owing to shortage of labour andto the fact that certain crops (e.g., sugar-beet) had notyet all been lifted. It was agreed that, subject to the exigencies of the military situation, the Army authori-ties would have to give help on a big scale at harvesttime.After further discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that the 7,000 men should be called up, withoutfurther deferment.
217W.M. 126 (41)&apos;.ago. The principle governing the practice in this matter should,he thought, be that M.P.&apos;s were liable under the National service acts and that it would be undesirable to confer statutory exemp-tion. But every M.P., besides his duties as a citizen, owed service to the Legislature It must be left to each Member to settle whether he would devote himself wholly to service as a Member of theLegislature, or whether he would undertake some other form ofNational Service. Furthermore, if an M.P. decided that he wouldtake service in the Armed Forces of the Crown, he should beallowed, if he so desired, at a later date to change his option and tobe released from further military service, provided, of course, thatreasonable notice was given.The War Cabinet-Expressed general agreement with these views, and took note that the Prime Minister would deal with the matter on the following day, in answer to a Private notice question. *Iceland.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 125thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The War Cabinet were informed that a telegram had nowbeen received from our High Commissioner in Dublin stating thatMr. de Valera invited the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs to pay a visit to Dublin. The visit should be attended with,as littlepublicity as possible.       ,The Secretary of State for Dominion, Affairs said that fromthe terms of the telegram it appeared that what Mr. de Valera hadto tell him was not of some change in Eire&apos;s attitude, but rather thereasons why he did not see his way to make any change at thepresent time.The War Cabinet-Thought that it was nevertheless desirable that theDominions Secretary should accept this invitation, and authorised him to proceed accordingly.Wages and 7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theCost of Living.   Lord President of the Council (W.P. (G) (41) 149).This Memorandum explained that the policy of price stabilisation-sation set out in the White Paper (Cmd. 2694) had hitherto been maintained. But, besides the award! made by the agricultural wages Board of a national minimum wage of 60s. a week to agricultural workers, claims for substantial wage increases by the engineers and shipbuilders were now being heard by the national arbitration Tribunal. Negotiations were also proceeding on a claim by the railwaymen. If these claims resulted in substantial increases in wage rates over a wide field, the policy of price stabilisation would be seriously jeopardised. Nevertheless, theLord Presidents Committee had been satisfied that it would bedifficult for the Government to make any new declaration of policywhile applications to the Arbitration Tribunal were still sub judice.They thought, however, that it should be our aim to be ready witha new wages policy to arrest the inflationary process, and that thisshould be applied as soon as the present wage cycle had! beencompleted, and, in any event, before next year&apos;s Budget was introduced.In discussion, the view was expressed that there was no certainty that there would be any clear dividing line&apos;between theend of one wage cycle and the beginning of another. It was essential that the position should be tackled! before the inflationary*&apos; See Annex.
tendency got out of control. No room should be left for growth ofthe feeling of discontent which already existed in the Forces at thehigh rates of pay of munition workers.The suggestion was made that the Government should at oncestate publicly that they proposed to announce a new wages policy as soon as the cases now being heard by the National arbitration tribunal had been disposed of. The view was, however, expressed that this step was premature until decisions had been reached as tothe new policy to be adopted. Emphasis was also laid on the undesirability of taking action which would be interpreted as anattempt to interfere with the hearing of the claims now before theTribunal.After further discussion, the War Cabinet ,Endorsed the Conclusions of the Lord Presidents Com-mittee, on the understanding that proposals for dealingwith the matter would be submitted to the War cabinet as quickly as possible, with a view to a new statement ofpolicy being announced as soon as the cases now before the arbitration Tribunal had been disposed of.Great George Street, S.W. 1,December 10, 1941.ANNEX.House of Commons, December 11, 1941 (Hansard, Column 1696).National Service Acts.(Members of Parliament.)Sir P. Harris (by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether he hasany statement to make about the position of Members of Parliament under theNational Service Acts ?The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill): Yes, Sir. I am glad to take this opportunity of explaining the position of Members of Parliament under theNational Service Acts.In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it would not be appropriate toconfer on Members of Parliament a statutory exemption from the obligations which they share in common with everyone else. Members of Parliament have,however, also the high duty of service in the Legislature, and they must them-selves be the judges of how that duty can best be performed. They are thereforegiven a free choice by virtue of their position as Members of Parliament and not as a favour. This was the position in the last war, and has always been maintained in the present war. Furthermore, if a Member of Parliament joinsthe Armed Forces of the Crown, and later decides that he wishes to devote hiswhole time to Parliamentary duties, arrangements are made for his release from military service for that purpose, provided, of course, that reasonable notice isgiven to arrange for his relief.Considering the very large number of Members serving with the Forces, andthe many questions that may arise in the combining and reconciling of their duties, it is very satisfactory that there has been so little difficulty in practice.
MfffT SECRET - NO PECULATION.W,M, (41) Igftth CONCLUSIONS.(10th. December, 1941, 6 n.m.)*THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had received a reply from President Roosevelt about his proposed visit to the United States, suggesting that heshould go early in January and should meet him atone of   the West Indian islands.   He (the PrimeMinister) was not satisfied, and thought that itwas important that the visit should take place at amuch sooner date, although it was immaterial to himwhere the visit took place.   He had sent a messagein this sense.SIR EARLE PAGE said that, if the visit was postponed, it might be desirable that the first sea Lord should go at once to the United states in order to concert an agreed strategic policy withthe Americans .THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that AdmiralLittle, our Naval Representative on the Joint StaffMission, was in close touch with Admiral Stark.But in any case he was hoping that his visit wouldtake place in the near future.

COPY 10 Downing Street.7th February, 1942.Dear Speed,The Prime Minister has been consulted as towhether it is necessary Hiat any steps should be taken tomake known - e.g. by Question and Answer in the House -the ruling which he gave in the case of a Member ofParliament serving in the R.A,F.V.R., namely, that suchan Officer should not be posted abroad if, in his own opinion, service overseas would conflict with his duty to his constituents.The Prime Minister&apos;s view is that a Member&apos;first duty is to the House of Commons, and even though he may have entered one of the Services he may apply for relief and when this can be conveniently effected he canreturn to Great Britain for his Parliamentary work.He would not thereby be debarred from taking up other work with the Forces, if such work were thought useful to the public.     It follows from this that if a Memberwho has been doing useful work with the Forces at homeand has combined this work with his Parliamentary duties,belongs to a unit which is ordered abroad, he should beallowed to transfer and not be forced to resign unless there is no other useful work that he could do at home.These cases, however, should be rare, and it ought tobe possible, in the Prime Minister^ view, to prevent them reaching a point at which any difficulty arisesthrough a conflict of duties.     He therefore does not regard it as necessary that there should be any public announcement of the ruling given in this particular case.     The only action which is being taken is to sendcopies of this note to the Private Secretaries of thethree Service Ministers.     Mr. Churchill proposes that,if the Ministers have no comments, the scheme should be operated forthwith.     Could you please let me know if your Secretary of State agrees?E. B.B.  Speed, Esq., M. C. ,War Office.Similar letters to:-R.H. Melville, Esq.,Air Ministry,CS, Jarrett, Esq.,ADMIRALTY.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)    J.M. MARTIN.
