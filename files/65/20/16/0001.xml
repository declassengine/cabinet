Finland,Hungary and roumania.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 122ndConclusions,Minute 6.)1. A further discussion took place, and is recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Man-power.(previous reference:2. The War Cabinet were informed that a section of theLabour Party was putting forward the view that the GovernmentsMan-Power proposals should be matched by further measures for conclusions,Minute 10.)Control ofIndustry.W.M. (41) 122nd public control over industry and property. Two amendments to thePrime Minister&apos;s Motion had been put down on these lines. Manyresponsible and level-headed members of the Labour Party held that full support for the war effort would not be obtained unless widermeasures of control were exercised, and favoured measures to securepublic ownership in regard to transport, mines and, perhaps, finance.In support of this view, they cited the criticisms made in the house that many industrial undertakings were being run by the manage-ments with an eye on the position after the war.In discussion reference was made to the very high rate oftaxation. The President of the Board of Trade gave particulars of the control exercised in regard to steel and coal in the present,as compared with the last, war. The present control over coal was far more effective than in the last war. A close survey was nowbeing undertaken in order to determine whether and in whatcircumstances the policy should be economic development ormaximum output in the immediate future. The steel industry wascontrolled from top to bottom in a way far exceeding anything which had happened in the last war. The control extended to pro-duction, distribution, price and the conduct of particular under-takings. An instance was given of a very large undertaking which,although producing steel on a large scale, might have to pass itsdividend.As regards transport, the view was advanced that less criticismwas now being heard m regard to the operation of the railways than some time previously.The Minister of Labour and National Service suggested,however, that some further measures of control over and abovemeasures which could be enforced through the present system of licensing, might be necessary in regard to the omnibus undertakings.Other instances were cited of the drastic measures in regardto industry and property which the Government had taken where necessary in the public interest, e.g., the scheme for the concentration of industries. Again, the Production Departments did not hesitate to take over the management of firms where they were not satisfied with their efficiency.The view was advanced by The Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security that the Governments position should be thatthe acid test was whether a particular measure was necessary forthe efficient prosecution of the war; and that the Government wereprepared to consider on its merits any measure which might benecessary to this end, not-excluding measures of public ownershipor control.This view met with general support. It was considered,however, that the balance of advantage lay im treating this matter in such a way as was least likely to arouse further controversy; andthat it would suffice if the Lord-President o*f the Council, in thecourse of his speech that afternoon, made a short statement to theeffect that the Government, would take any measure of control overproperty necessary to help win the war.
203W.M. 123 (M).The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord President of the Council to make a state-ment on these lines, the terms of which should be agreed with the Lord Privy Seal and the Chancellor of theExchequer, and shown to the Prime Minister.Note. The statement made was as follows : &quot; Winning the war is the sole object. How to do it is the sole test. The Government will not be timid or half-hearted in taking control of any property or undertaking to whatever extent may be found necessary if by that means a fuller development of the war effort is realised.&quot;Great George Street, S.W. 1,December 3, 1941.
