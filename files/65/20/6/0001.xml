1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a request had been received from the United States: Government thatwe should give facilities for food to be sent to the Vatican. Thepopulation of the Vatican city was about 4,000, and the amountsinvolved were not large. The. Americans cited, in support of this request, the fact that we had allowed a limited amount of food tobe sent into Switzerland, through the blockade.The Foreign Secretary said that he had discussed the matter with the Minister of Economic Warfare, and it was proposed toagree to the request made by the United States Government.In discussion, the view was expressed that the request wasnot altogether easy to justify on merits, nor would it meet withany particular support from public opinion. As, however, therequest was put to us and pressed by the United StatesGovernment, it would be right to accede to it, subject to proper safeguards, making it plain that the request was not one which we found it easy to agree to.The War Cabinet-Accordingly authorised the Foreign Secretary to despatch a telegram (the terms of which had been concerted withthe Minister of Economic Warfare), agreeing to this request.Blockade.Food supplies to the vatican.Man-Power.(PreviousUef erence:W.M. (41) 110thConclusions,Minute 1.)Employmentof Women byGovernmentDepartments.Women labour for munition factories.2. The War Cabinet had a general discussion on certainMan-power questions.In the course of discussion, reference was made to theemployment of women aged 20-30 in clerical posts in GovernmentDepartments.The Minister of Supply said that he was prepared to releaselarge numbers of such women from his Ministry for munition work,provided that similar action was taken by all Departments.The War Cabinet were informed that a difference had arisenon this matter between the Ministry of Labour and the three service departments. A compromise proposal had been put forward by theChancellor of the Exchequer (L.P. (41) 187), which was to beconsidered by the Lord Presidents Committee on the following day.The Prime Minister hoped that no steps would be taken in thismatter which would be to lead to disorganisation of essential workin Government Departments, more particularly in Sections engagedin Confidential duties.The War Cabinet-Took note that this matter was to be discussed at the lord presidents Committee on the following day, and that aReport would be made to the Prime Minister before action was taken.The Minister of Supply said that his great need was to getadditional women workers for munition factories, particularly the filling factories. 37,500 women workers were required for filling factories at once. Absenteeism at the moment represented abouta quarter of the total employed labour. In one factory, Swynnerton,80 per cent, of the intake of labour was lost through wastage.The Minister of Labour and National Service, who said that theMinister of Supply&apos;s statement was not in accord with the facts
as reported to him, made a statement of the steps which he was taking to obtain women for the munition industries and for the ;auxiliary services.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Supply and the Minister of Labourand National Service to arrange for an agreed statementof the facts to be prepared as to the supply of women workers to the filling factories. This statement should cover in respect of, say, the last two months (a) The outstanding demands for labour.(b) The total number of women (i) supplied to, and(ii) taken on by, these factories.(c) The wastage rate.(d) Absenteeism.Great George Street, S.W.1,November 13, 1941.
