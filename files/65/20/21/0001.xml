1. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Education (W.P. (G) (41) 140).The War Cabinet-(i) Took note, with approval, of the preparatory work in hand for the work of writing official histories of the war.(ii) Approved the proposed public announcement of the estab-lishment of the Advisory Committee of universityhistorians, and of the Editorial Board of the MedicalHistory.2. The Lord Privy Seal said that several Members of Parlia-Proposed Secret ment were pressing for a Debate before the recess. The subjectsSession. which they desired to discuss were (a) The circumstances attending the loss of the Prince of wales and the Repulse.(b) The machinery for inter-Allied co-ordination.Neither subject could well be discussed except in Secret Session,and there were reasons why it would be difficult to agree to a discussion in Secret Session on any day earlier than Friday, the19th December. This, however, might well involve a further sittingon Saturday, the 20th December, on which date the House wouldadjourn.After discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that the Members concerned should be informedthat the Government were willing that the matters inquestion should be discussed at a Secret Session on Friday,the 19th December, though this might involve a further meeting of the House on Saturday, the 20th December; butthat they could not agree to the Secret Session being heldon an earlier date.OfficialHistories.The present war.Parliament.Parliament. 3.   The War Cabinet were informed that in the previous yearArrangements    Parliament  had  adjonrned  on  the  19th  December  and had for the Eecess.   reassembled on the 21st January.   It was desired to have a recessof about the same length this year.   The Motion passed in each house would, of course, contain the usual provision for theimmediate recall of the House if the need arose.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury to make arrangements on the basis that the house would adjourn at the end of the week until Tuesday, the20th January.Parliament. 4.Powers of theHouse ofCommons in theevent ofMr. Speaker&apos;sdeath.The War Cabinet Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to make the necessary arrangements for the drafting of a Bill, on the lines setout in W.P. (G) (41) 145, dealing with the powers of theHouse of Commons in the event of Mr. Speaker&apos;s death.[23259]
Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:WM. (41) 125thConclusions,Minute 3.)Air Operations.naval operations.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.Libya.Far Bast.Malaya.5.   The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 828-834 :_Summary of aircraft losses since the 8th December :-Home Theatre--Enemy r6 destroyed.8 damaged.Our Own *13 fighters.6 bombers.7 Coastal Command aircraft.Middle East (mainly in the Libyan Battle)  &apos;Enemy 70 destroyed.Our Own 61 destroyed.Far East (on the basis of incomplete information) Enemy 17 destroyed.Our Own 11 destroyed.In addition to the above, we had destroyed one Vichy Frenchaircraft near Freetown.In Home Waters eight enemy merchant vessels had been hit;in Mediterranean waters two enemy merchant vessels had been hit.The cruiser Galatea had been sunk by a U-boat on the previous night off Alexandria. The sloop Flamingo had been bombed and damaged, but had made harbour. The destroyer Puckeridge hadbeen disabled by bombs west of Milford Haven, but had been towedinto port. Four trawlers had been sunk, two off Gibraltar and twooff the East Coast.Four of our destroyers in the Eastern Mediterranean had sunktwo Italian cruisers and damaged a torpedo boat. A U-boat hadbeen sunk off Bardia and prisoners taken. Another U-boat had beenshelled and, it was hoped, sunk. The submarine Urge had obtainedtwo hits on an Italian battleship near Messina.In the previous week we had lost 30,000 tons of shipping from enemy action and 6,000 from marine casualties. Another 13,000 tonsof shipping had been damaged.51,000 tons of shipping had been reported sunk so far thismonth. Belated reports of substantial sinkings in the Pacific mustbe anticipated.On the 10th December enemy forces had started withdrawing totheir present position, which extended from Gazala to some25 miles to the south. There were indications that they would endeavour to withdraw further to the Mechili-Derna line. On the13th December the 4th Indian Division had destroyed 16 enemytanks out of 50, which was believed to be the total number left to theenemy. ^In north-east Malaya the brigade holding the Kota Bahru area had fallen back some 25 miles. In north-west Malaya a line was now held about 22 miles south of Alor Star. At Krohcol our forces had withdrawn to 4 miles west of Kroh. In Burma there had beenheavy air attacks on Tavoy, Mergui and Victoria Point aerodromes,which were all out of action. At Hong Kong our forces had with-drawn to the Island, which was being heavily shelled. In the philippines three landings had been effected in Luzon.
The Allies.Inter-allied co-ordination.6. The Lord President of the Council referred to telegram5805 from Washington. There were other indications that we might be pressed to introduce some rather elaborate form of Inter-Allied co-ordination. In his view the circumstances of the present war were wholly different from those of the last war, and it wouldbe rash to assume that the machinery for a Supreme War Councilset up in the last war was applicable in the present circumstances.Sir Earle Page said that he felt sure that opinion in australia would be that the British Empire, by virtue of its being a world-wide Power, was best fitted to retain the leadership in this matterand not relinquish it to any other country.The Lord Privy Seal referred to the fact that this matter was likely to be raised in the Secret Session on Thursday. He thoughtit would be useful that a statement should be prepared as to themachinery of Inter-Allied co-ordination which at present existed,and a study undertaken of such developments as would appear likelyto be required in the future.The War Cabinet-Expressed agreement with this view, and instructed theSecretary to arrange for the preparation of a statement onthe lines proposed.The Empire. 7.   In connection with the preceding item, the Minister of planning of Labour and National Service thought that it would be desirable, atProduction.       some stage, that there should be an Inquiry into the man-power position on a wider basis than the resources of the United Kingdom.The Secretary of State for India suggested that more could be done to increase production facilities in India.It was pointed out that any such increase would mean sendingsome skilled labour overseas. The First Lord of the Admiraltymentioned that he was already finding it difficult to get labour tosend to Admiralty yards overseas.The view was expressed that it would be an advantage if this latter problem could he dealt with as part of some general schemeI: &apos;        The Japanese intentions appeared to be -(a) A major attack on Singapore with a simultaneous, but lesspowerful, attack on Luzon;(b) An attack on Hong Kong;(c) An advance on Rangoon and/or Lashio with a view tostopping our supplies to China.U.S.S.R. The Russians had had marked successes against the northern and southern arms of the German pincer movements to envelopMoscow. In the Klin and Tula areas the Germans had been forcedback with heavy casualties and large losses of equipment. the depth of the withdrawal in the Tula area was as much as 50 miles.It seemed that, after attempting to capture Moscow, theGermans had decided to withdraw to a shorter line during thewinter, and this withdrawal had been hastened by the russian offensive. The Russians were still attacking along this part of thefront.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
U.S.S.B. 8.   The War Cabinet had a further discussion on a point(Previous arising out of the  forthcoming discussions with the  SovietEeference: Government.W.M. (41) 124th        A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;conclusions, Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Minute 3.)Great George Street, S.W. 1,December 15, 1941.for the co-ordination of Empire production rather than as aseparate issue. But the problem raised by the First Lord was animmediate one, which could not await the result of any long Inquiry.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
