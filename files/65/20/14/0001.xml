The   War   Cabinet   had   before   them   the   following documents: (a) The Man-Power Situation generally and the NationalService (No. 2) Bill.A Memorandum by the Prime Minister (W.P. (41V291).A Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and national Service (W.P. (41) 284).Draft of the National Service (No. 2) Bill (W.P. (G)(41)142).Draft White Paper on the Bill (W.P.

(41) 278and 289).A Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and national Service (W.P. (41) 285).A Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Supply andthe Minister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (GV(41) 136).(e) Scheme for training Boys and Girls.A Report by the Lord President of the Council(W.P. (G) (41) 137).(d) Women in Government Departments.A Report by the Lord President of the Council(W.P. (G) (41) 131).(e) The Man-Power Position in the Civil Defence Services.A Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security (*W.P. (G) (41) 134).(1) The Prime Minister, at the outset, reviewed some of thepoints on which decisions had already been reached. For example,administrative measures had already been taken with a view toreplacing the system of block reservation by occupation by a systemof individual deferment based on the national importance of thework being performed by the individual. This was to be followedby a drastic review of existing deferments.The Prime Minister said that he attached considerable importance to the timing of the review of existing deferments inrelation to the other parts of the scheme, from the point of view ofpublic opinion. It was well known that numbers of men under 41and at present reserved should be combed out. It was important that this should be done soon, having regard to the obligations whichthe proposed legislation would place on other members of thecommunity.(2) Arrangements had already been made for giving effect tothe decision that young men should in future be called up for the armed Forces at the age of 18^.In this connection the view was very generally expressed that, inpresent circumstances, it was difficult to justify continuance of thepractice whereby youths under 20 in the Army were not sent overseas. The assurance given in this matter had been that, ifpossible, before men called up under the National Service (armed forces) Act were sent out of the country under the age of 20, astatement should be made in the House explaining the circumstances which had rendered that course necessary.*; The Secretary of Statefor War was invited to consider whether the time had not come to change the practice in this matter, and to reduce the age at whichsoldiers could be sent overseas from 20 to 19.* Hansard, 3rd September, 1939, Column 326.[23203-2] b 2Reservation andDeferment.
The Principle ofCompulsoryService forWomen in theAuxiliarySeryices and civil defence forces..Exemption of married women from compulsory service in theAuxiliaryServices or civil      &quot; X &quot;defence forces.Agreement was expressed with the view set out in paragraph 4of the Prime Ministers paper (W.P. (41) 291) that the upperage-limit in the Bill should be 51 and not 61.(3) The War Cabinet next discussed the question of principle involved in the application to women of compulsion to join the auxiliary Services or Civil Defence Forces.The Minister of Supply said that he did not favour thisproposal., for the following reasons : First, that better results wouldbe obtained, if the Army were themselves to undertake a compre-hensive recruiting campaign on a voluntary basis. Secondly, thatthe measure would give rise to dissatisfaction. Thirdly, that it wasa mistake to have a separation between industry and the Army:either direction, or the process of compulsion, should be applied inall cases. Fourthly, that, when women in large numbers were badly needed in industry, it was a mistake to recruit so many women intothe Army. He believed that substantial numbers of men could be released by the Supply Departments, provided women could be foundto replace them.The Prime Minister said that it was essential to replace menby women in certain non-mobile military jobs, such as the BalloonBarrage, and work in connection with anti-aircraft guns. looking at the problem as a whole, there was no likelihood of there being more men available than were wanted.The Secretary of State for Air feared that the proposal to applycompulsion to join the Auxiliary Services would give rise todissatisfaction among the men in the Services. He thought that, ifthe power of direction of women into the factories was moredrastically exercised, the result would be that many more wouldvolunteer for the Services.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that one ofthe gravest difficulties which he now had to meet was the fact thathe was using indirect pressure to get women to join the Services.This was much resented, and he was sure that a direct approach would be far better received.The First Lord of the Admiralty was opposed to applying theprinciple of compulsion.The Secretary of State for the Colonies thought that it wouldbe better to start with proclaiming the age group 20-35, or, say,25-35. Otherwise he saw no objection to the proposal to applycompulsion.All the other Ministers present favoured the application of theprinciple of compulsion to women to join the Auxiliary Servicesand Civil Defence Forces, which was adopted.(4) General agreement was expressed with the view thatmarried women should not be called up for the auxiliary services or Civil Defence Forces, although they should be allowed to volunteer.The War Cabinet also agreed with the statement of the positionset out in paragraphs 14 and 15 of the Prime minister&apos;s memorandum (W.P. (41) 291), subject to the insertion of the words&quot; (or Civil Defence Services) &quot; after &quot; an industrial job,&quot; in para-graph 14 (a).. The Secretary of State for War feared that, if married women were exempt from being called up for the Auxiliary Services, hewould find it difficult to resist the claim to allow the release of married women already in those Services.  ,.:ox The general view was that this position could be maintained,more especially since a single woman who was called up and posted to one of the Auxiliary Services under the new legislation proposed,
Option opento Womencornpursorilyrecruited intothe auxiliary services or civil defence forces.and who subsequently married, would not be released. Any other course would put a premium on reckless marriages.Reference was made to the position of women in the Serviceswho became pregnant. The Secretary of State for War said th&amp;tthey were always released.It was agreed that it might be as well to make this fact clear to the House.(5) Considerable discussion took place on the proposal inparagraph? of the Prime Minister&apos;s Memorandum (W.P: (41) 291)that women, on being called up, would be given an optionbetween: .(a) the Auxiliary Services;(6) the Civil Defence Forces;(c) certain specified jobs in industry, e.g., filling factories which, owing to their location, could only be filled by women transferred from a distance.-General agreement was expressed with the view that this optionwas -desirable. There was great advantage in people having a say we deciding the jobs for which they were best suited, moreparticularly in its application to the novel problems now being dealtwith.Fears were expressed by some Ministers, that the great majorityof women would opt for industrial employment; by others, that nearly all would opt for the Auxiliary Services.The general view taken was that so many varying factors would enter into the choice made by individual women (e.g., location,family circumstances, and so forth) thai it was unlikely that therewould be any very pronounced swing in one direction. In thesecircumstances, the right course would be to start by allowing, at the outset, a free option between the three types of services set out inparagraph 7; it being understood that if the exercise of this optionbecame unworkable, the matter would have to be reviewed.Discussion ensued as to which jobs in industry should beincluded within the option under paragraph 7 (c) of the PrimeMinister&apos;s Memorandum.The Minister of Supply asked that it should be confined to the filling factories.The Minister of Labour thought that it might be necessary toinclude certain other factories in the congested areas, and further,that the point was one which had best be left flexible for adjustmentbetween the Production Ministers.After some discussion, the Prime Minister suggested, and theWar Cabinet agreed, that the wording of paragraph 7 (c) shouldbe amended to read as follows : &apos;&apos; Such specified jobs in industry as the Minister of Labourmay direct.&quot;: For the time being it should be understood that the Minister of!Labour&apos;s instructions from the War Cabinet were to give priority in this matter to the filling factories, subject to it being understoodthat these instructions could be revised or modified by the WarCabinet at a later date. &quot; &apos;Should women (6) The Secretary of State for Air pressed! for the continuance-compulsorlly of an qption between the three -Services.   The general view of therecruited into War Cabinet was that there would be great practical difficulties inthe Auxiliary combining such an &quot;Option with -the option given between the three services ibe types of Service set out in paragraph 7 of the Prime Mini6ter&apos;sgiven :an option Memorandum, more especially seeing that the real difficultybetween those throughout had been to find recruits for the A:T.S.   Moreover, itServices ? was relevant that all woinen had had ahopportunity to volunteerfor any of the^ itiiree^Scrvice^ -and that those -outside the ages[23203-2]b 3
Scheme ofTraining forBoys and Girls.Home Guard.Recruitment ofCivil defence services.&quot;proclaimed would still be able to do so after the passing of theproposed legislation.The War Cabinet&apos;s instructions to the Minister of Labour were,therefore, to allot women to the W.R.N.S., the W.A.A.F. and theA.T.S. on the basis of the needs of those services.(7) The Lord President explained the proposals in his Report(W.P. (G) (41) 137) which had the support of the Departmentsconcerned.Boys of 16-18 would be enabled to play their part in manningthe searchlights and anti-aircraft batteries, as a result of arrange-ments which the War Office were making to use the Home Guard ona part-time basis, for operational duties in A.D.G.B. The WarOffice had agreed that, for those Home Guard units which were tobe employed in A.D.G.B., the age of enrolment should be reduced from 17 to 16.There would be compulsory registration of all boys in the 16-18age group. The particulars obtained on registration would be passed to the Youth Service Committees of the EducationAuthorities, who would arrange for the boys to be interviewed, andencouraged to join one or other of the existing organisations through which they could obtain the training required to fit them for national service. To cater for the larger numbers likely to beobtained by this means, there would be some expansion of the^cadetmovements, directly controlled by the Services, and also, so far aspracticable, of the other voluntary organisations concerned with the welfare of young people.In this connection the Lord President corrected a statement made in paragraph 4 of his Memorandum. He now understood thatthe Air Ministry were not at present disposed to reduce the lowerage limit for the A.T.C. from 16 to 14; and he asked that thisparagraph of his Memorandum should be taken as stating merelythat &quot; the Air Ministry would wish to be free to undertake a corres-ponding expansion of the A.T.C. by reducing the lower age limitfrom 16 to 14.&quot;The requirement of compulsory registration would apply togirls as well as boys; but it was contemplated that the registration and interviewing of girls in the 16-18 age-group would not beundertaken until substantial progress had been made with the inter-viewing of boys in this age-group.The War Cabinet approved the Lord Presidents Report.(8) The question was raised whether power should be includedin the National Service (No. 2) Bill to compel men to join the home guard. While this might raise controversial issues, it was felt thatit would be anomalous to exclude the Home Guard altogether fromlegislation applying compulsion to all other Services.The Secretary of State for War said that he did not contem-plate applying compulsion for the Home Guard on any extensive scale. There were, however, certain rural areas, particularly in theEastern and South-Eastern Regions, where the numbers of the home guard fell considerably short of requirements.After discussion, it was agreed that power should be taken under the Bill to make a Regulation under which men could bedirected to join the Home Guard, but that such a Regulation shouldnot be made until there had been an opportunity of testing feeling in Parliament by a debate on this specific point.(9) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat, for the reasons given in his Memorandum W.P. (G) (41) 143, he feared that some anomalies would arise from the application of two different methods of recruiting women compulsorily for civil defence The present proposals would have the effect that, for those branches of Civil Defence which had been declared Civil Defence
,i      .,       &quot;Forces,&quot; women could not be recruited compulsorily exceptthrough the calling up of age-groups; and this might mean that inthese branches he would have to use younger women for work which. older women were qualified to do.   He was, however, prepared to face these anomalies if the Minister of Labour would give an assurance that, concurrently with the calling up of women for theI - Civil Defence &quot;Forces,&quot; he would issue directions under the&apos;.r: 1        Defence Regulations to fill vacancies, as required, in the civil defence &quot; Services.&quot;The Minister of Labour pointed out that he could not guarantee to fill all vacancies in establishments determined by the HomeSecretary, as this would give the needs of Civil Defence a priority over all other needs. He was, however, prepared to agree to asystem by which the needs of the various departments would be examined interdepartmentally, probably by the Man-Power Com-mittee, and allocations decided upon. Thereafter directions underthe Defence Regulations would be issued in accordance with theseallocations.The War Cabinet agreed that a system on these lines should beintroduced.Man-Power (10) The War Cabinet invited the Lord Presidents CommitteeRequirements of to examine the new estimate of the numbers of men and womenCivil Defence,    required in Civil Defence, as set out in the Memorandum (W.P. (G)(41) 134) circulated by the Home Secretary and Minister of home security, and to submit their recommendations to the War Cabinet.Employment ofWomen byGovernmentDepartments.parliamentary programme.White Paper.(11) The Lord President explained that the recommendations in his Report W.P. (G) (41) 131 were accepted by the Departmentsprimarily concerned.The First Lord of the Admiralty asked whether the decision taken earlier at the meeting to call up women in the 20-30 age-group would affect the agreement which had been reached regarding therelease, by Government Departments, of women clerical workers inthis age-group. It was agreed that the new decision would not affectthat agreement.The War Cabinet endorsed the recommendations made in theLord Presidents Report.(12) The Prime Minister said that he proposed to open the debate on Tuesday, the 2nd December, with a short b statementoutlining the Governments general policy for the further mobilisa-tion of men and women for national service. The Minister ofLabour would make a more detailed statement on the following day.The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury said thatit was now proposed that the Bill should be introduced on the dayfollowing the debate, and its passage through the House ofCommons completed in the week ending the 13th December.(13) It was agreed that there would be advantages in laying a white Paper summarising the Governments policy and setting outthe main changes proposed. This, however, should be laid togetherwith the Bill after the debate had taken place. This would afford an opportunity for revising the text of the White Paper, if need arose, in the light of the discussion during the debate.The War Cabinets Conclusions were as follows :-(I) Approval was given to the introduction of legislationimposing on all persons of either sex a liability to national Service, whether in the Armed Forces, in CivilDefenpe, in industry, or otherwise.  As regards service
in the Armed Forces or Civil Defence: Forces, the age-limits would be 18 to 50 (and not 60; as provisionallydecided on the 10th November^(II) The Secretary of State for War was invited to considerwhether the time had come to reduce the age at whichsoldiers could be sent overseas from 20 to 19.(III) Approval was given to the introduction of legislationcompelling single women to join the Auxiliary services or Civil Defence Forces^ subject to the safeguards and provisions agreed upon by the War Cabinet on the10th November.(IV) The position of married women in regard to their liability for National: Service was reaffirmed. The summary ofthe position given in paragraphs 13-15 of W.P. (41)291was approved, subject to the amendment set out at &quot; X.&quot;(V) Women; on being called up; should be given an optionbetween (a) The Auxiliary Services;(b) The Civil Defence Forces;(c) Such specified jobs in Industry as the Minister ofLabour and National Service may direct. (it being, of course, understood that, if, for any reason, the exercise of this option becameunworkable, the matter would have to^ herreviewed.)(VI) For the time being, the Minister of Labour and NationalService would give priority to the filling factories infilling the &quot;specified jobs in industry&quot; referred to. inthe preceding conclusion, it being understood that these instructions could be revised or modified by the War,Cabinet at a later date.(VII) Women compulsorily recruited into the auxiliary services would not be given an option between W.R.N.S.,W.A.A.F. and A.T.S. The Minister of Labour and national Service would allot women to these Services onthe basis of their needs.(VIII) The proposals for the training of boys and girls in W.P.(G) (41) 137 were approved.(IX) Power should be taken by the Bill to make a Regulationunder which men might be directed to join the home guard. But such a Regulation should not be madeoperative until there had been an opportunity for testingthe feeling in Parliament by a Debate on this specificpoint.(X) A distinction between Civil Defence &apos;&apos; Forces &apos;&apos; and civil defence &quot; Services &quot; would have to be maintained. Butan arrangement would be made whereby the needs of thevarious Departments would be examined inter-depart-mentally, and allocations decided upon. Thereafter, theMinister of Labour and National Service would issuedirections in accordance with these allocations.(XL) The new estimate of the numbers of men and womenrequired in Civil Defence, as set out in the Memorandumby the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security(W.P. (G) (41) 134) should be examined by the lord president&apos;s Committee.(XII) The recommendations in the Report by the lord president, of the Council (W.P. (G); (41) 131), as to theemployment of women by Government Departments,were approved. These recommendations were not affected by the decision to call up women in the 20-30age-group.* W.M. (41) 110th Conclusions, Minute 1.
Parliament. 2.   In discussion on the previous item, the hope was expressedThe National that the National Service (No. 2) Bill would pass through all itsService (No. 2) stages in the House of Commons during the week ending theBill. 13th December.   If, however, the House of Lords was unable tocomplete its discussions of the Bill by Thursday, 18th December,there might be difficulty in arranging for any Lords&apos; amendments to be considered in the Commons without prolonging the sittings ofthe House into the following week.The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal, the Leader of the House ofLords and the Chief Whip to review the parliamentary time-table and to consider whether it would be necessaryfor Parliament to meet on one or more additional days(Mondays or Fridays) in order to complete outstandingbusiness in the week ending Saturday, the 20th December.Transport. 3.   In connection with the question of the option to be givenFacilities for to women to take up work in certain specified jobs in industry (seefactories in Minute 1, paragraph (5)), discussion took place as to the need forremote areas.    improving transportation facilities to factories in remote areas.This involved not merely services from the neighbouring towns and villages to the factories, but also improvement in the local distribu-tion of the services in the neighbouring towns.Some discussion ensued as to the practicability of making morebuses or army lorries available for the purpose.The Prime Minister asked the Service Ministers to submitparticulars of the buses they had available, showing how many werein running order and how many were laid up for repairs. He hopedthat some scheme might be devised which would enable moretransport to be made available for the purpose in question. Itmight be necessary for the matter to be examined by a small committee.Great George Street, S.W. 1.November 28, 1941.(XIII) A White Paper, summarising the Government&apos;s policyand setting out the main changes proposed, should beissued, but not until after the debate which was to takeplace in the following week. The draft submitted to theWar Cabinet (W.P. (G) (41) 144) should be revised, if need be, in the light of the debate.
