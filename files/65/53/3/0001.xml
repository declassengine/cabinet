India. 1.   The Prime Minister thanked the Viceroy for attending to constitutional give the Cabinet the benefit of his views on the Indian constitutional position.        problem.(Previous The Cabinet had considered the proposals put forward by the reference: India Committee, but they were not satisfied as to the wisdom of cm. (45) 2nd making a fresh offer to India on the lines proposed. AdmittedlyConclusions, there would be advantages in removing India from the field of minute 2.) political controversy at the General Election by announcingproposals which had been worked out under the coalition government. The Cabinet must first, however, be satisfied thatthe scheme was sound on its merits. If this plan were accepted and put into effect, was there not some risk that it might reduce thestanding, authority and competence of the Governor-General&apos; executive Council&apos;( Might it not even prove to be a retrograde step from the point of view of putting the Government of india on a democratic basis if, as a result of the composition pf the newExecutive Council, matters of the highest secrecy and importancetended in future to be handled independently by the Viceroy and commander-in-Chief? Was it likely that these proposals wouldbe accepted by public opinion as a worthy contribution towardsthe solution of India&apos;s constitutional problem? There were greatreforms to be undertaken in India. We were ourselves perhapsopen to criticism on the ground that we had not tackled them with sufficient resolution. But would the elements now proposed to bebrought into the Viceroy&apos;s Council be those needed to deal withthose problems, or would they rather be what he might describe asfactionaries ? The Cabinet would greatly value an expression ofthe Viceroy&apos;s views both on the merits of the plan and on theprocedure which he had in mind for giving effect to these proposals.Lord Wavell recalled that on his appointment as Viceroy hehad been instructed to consider what progress could be made towards a solution of the constitutional problem in India, and tomake recommendations to His Majesty&apos;s Government at the end of twelve or eighteen months. He reviewed the origin of his present proposals, which had been framed after discussions with governors and with senior European officials, and said that since thebeginning of this year he had felt bound to press&apos;for their early consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The end of the warin Europe was then in sight and he had thought this would be afavourable opportunity to try to break the political deadlock inIndia : he had also thought that the fall of Rangoon might make the&apos; situation more favourable as it would remove the last apprehensionof enemy attack on India : and, finally, there would have beenadvantages in obtaining a decision by a Coalition Government whichwould have avoided political controversy over India at a GeneralElection.He did not under-rate the difficulties of carrying through theproposals which he had put forward, but he thought that the presentsituation was still not unfavourable and that any other course,including that of making no move, would be more dangerous. Theadvantages of the course which he had recommended, as amended by the India Committee, were that the new Council would be a body with some sort of popular support, if chosen in the manner whichhe was about to describe; and that, if the experiment succeeded,it would, in his judgment, be accepted as a substantial step forward by opinion in India and outside. If it failed, we should have theadvantage of having made the most generous offer that circum-stances would permit. He believed that by the methods which he proposed it should be possible to secure a Council which would notbe inferior in intellectual quality to the present Council and wouldconduct itself in a reasonable manner, though admittedly it wouldbe more difficult to handle and more nationalist in temperament.The procedure which he had in mind was to put his proposals to the present Executive Council, immediately upon his return toIndia, and cable their views for consideration by His Majesty&apos;s
15CM. 3 (45).Government. He would then announce his proposals in a broad-cast in India, on the same date as the Secretary of State made his statement in Parliament. Thereafter he would summon aconference comprising the present Provincial Premiers, the individuals who last served as Premiers in the Provinces nowadministered under Section 93 of the Act of 1935, the leaders of congress and the Muslim League in the Legislative Assembly and&quot; the Council of State, the leader of the Independent Party in theAssembly, the two senior Indian members of his Council (Sir R.Mudaliar and Sir Sultan Ahmed), Gandhi, Jinnah, Dr. Ambedkarrepresenting the Depressed Classes, and Master Tara Singhrepresenting the Sikhs.This conference of twenty-two persons would be representativeof all the main sections of Indian opinion and would have substan-tial popular influence behind it. At least fourteen of its members would have held high administrative office for a number of years.Its composition would be approximately nine Hindu, six Muslimand seven falling outside those categories. There would be noquestion of negotiating with this conference on the offer itself. Ifthey were not prepared to co-operate on the basis of his proposals,he would report their attitude to His Majesty&apos;s Government andwould advise that no further concessions should be offered. If,however, they were ready to co-operate, he would ask them to advisehim on the selection of individuals to form his new Council, viz.,to put forward names from which he could select those whom hewould recommend to His Majesty&apos;s Government for appointment.He would urge them to make a substantially larger number ofnominations than there would be vacancies. He would deem himselfentirely free to reject, to select, to choose from outside the namesput forward, and of course to choose from outside the membership of the conference.After explaining his proposals to the conference and hearingtheir views, he would ask how they wished to proceed in thediscussion of possible names for his consideration. They wouldprobably split into Hindu and Muslim groups and put forwardseparate lists. In dealing with the recommendations made to him,he would aim at avoiding head-on collisions over individuals, but would point out the objections to one or the advantages of another,and might in addition be prepared to put forward independentproposals of his own. He hoped for, and it would be his object to attain, an Executive Council composed, in addition to the viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief, of four Congress and one non-Congress Hindus; four Muslim League and one non-Muslim LeagueMuslims; one Scheduled Caste (Dr. Ambedkar); one Sikh, and perhaps one other a total of fifteen, of which only four would bedrawn from the Congress.The Viceroy added that he would resist any attempt by theconference to enlarge their numbers. Finally, he recognised thathe would be faced with a demand that, in view of these discussions,the remaining members of the Congress Working Committee shouldbe released from detention. On this he proposed to consult his executive Council; and if they thought release advisable he would recommend that these persons should be released as soon as theconference assembled.In discussion the following points were made: (a) The scheme put forward by the Viceroy in the discussions had not been explained to the India Committee in detail; and the detailed scheme, particularly the procedure which he was proposing to follow, put his proposals in a new light.(&amp;) It was important that in any statement to be published itshould be made clear that the Viceroy would be free to reject therecommendations made by the conference for appointments to theExecutive Council, and to go outside any lists submitted by theconference. What was essentially involved was an extension and[30143-3] b 2
f ormalisation of the advice available to the Viceroy in selecting themembers of his Council.(c) Was there not a risk that Congress and the Muslim Leaguegroups would start by asking whether the Viceroy would accept their recommendations, and would break off the discussions as soonas they were told that rio such assurance could be given? LordWutetl thought this was unlikely.(d\ A great deal would depend on the extent of the desire inIndia to escape from the present political deadlock. If this desirewas strong, progress might be made on the lines indicated by theViceroy. Lord Wavell said that he thought there was a very strongwish on the part of Indian politicians to get back into office in theProvinces, and he hoped that for that reason they might be the most anxious to co-operate in his scheme. His hope was that theProvincial Governments would be reformed at the same time as theGovernment at the centre was reconstituted.After further discussion, The Prime Minister said that the explanations which the Viceroy had given had greatly clarified theposition and had gone far to remove the misgivings which he had felt about the proposals as presented in the Report of the india committee. It was now clear that the Viceroy would be free to reject, to select, and to use his influence as he thought.fit, in dealingwith the proposals made to him by the conference regarding thepersons whom he might recommend for appointment to his executive Council; and the effect of the scheme, as now explained,was to give the Viceroy rather more guidance, and to ensure that a wider survey was made of the field of choice, before his Council was formed.There could be no question of introducing before the GeneralElection amending legislation to remove the official element fromthe Executive Council. Nor should any public reference be madeat this stage to further Indianisation of the Indian Army: thatwas a matter which must be reserved for consideration by the new government. Finally, it must be clear that the offer which was tobe made to the conference was not open to extension by negotiation :if the conference was not ready to proceed on the offer as it stood,the project must be dropped. Subject to these three points, how-ever, he was disposed to favour the acceptance of the proposalswhich the Viceroy had explained to the Cabinet.As regards the release of persons still under detention, hethought that the Viceroy might be given discretion to deal withthis question on the lines which he had indicated in the discussion.It was, however, necessary that the India Committee should consider how the draft statement annexed to their Report(W P. (45) 274) should be adjusted to conform with the detailedexplanation which the Viceroy had now given of the procedure bywhich he would handle these proposals; and he suggested that theCommittee should meet forthwith to review the position in thelight of the Viceroy&apos;s statement.The Cabinet - r Invited the India Committee to review the position, as suggested by the Prime Minister, and to reportimmediately what adjustments should be made in thedraft statement annexed to W.P. (45) 274 in order to bringthat statement into conformity with the furtherexplanations which the Viceroy had given to the Cabinet.Syria andthe Lebanon.(previous reference erence:CM. (45&quot;) 2ndConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments in syria, as disclosed in telegrams 448 and 455 of the 31st May fromBeirut. The situation at Damascus had grown rapidly worse, andthe conduct of the French troops had become reckless and irre-sponsible. In addition to indiscriminate shelling, French troops were spraying the streets with machine-gun fire from vehicles and buildings; and even vehicles flying the British flag were not immune
17CM. 3 (45).from attack. The Syrian authorities were impatient at ourreluctance to intervene; and British troops were chafing at having to stand by and watch the brutality with which civilians were be ingtreated. During the previous afternoon an armistice had beenarranged for the evacuation of the British and American communi-ties; but it was expected that the French would resume their attacksas soon as this was over.His Majesty&apos;s Minister was isolated in Damascus, his tele-phone communication with the Lebanon and the Headquarters ofthe British 9th Army having been cut.It was the view of the Cabinet that, in the circumstances dis-closed by these telegrams, His Majesty&apos;s Government must instruct the British Commander-in-Chief in the Middle East to intervene,without further delay, with a view to restoring order.During the course of the meeting the Prime Minister tele-phoned to the United States Ambassador in London and verifiedthat he had as yet no news of any reply to the telegram (No. 59 ofthe 30th May) which the Prime Minister had sent to president truman in accordance with the decision reached by the Cabinet attheir meeting the previous evening. The Prime Minister then told the Ambassador that, in view of the continued deterioration in thesituation in Syria, His Majesty&apos;s Government had no alternative but to act in the sense indicated in that message, without waitingany longer for the Presidents reply. The Ambassador was invitedto inform President Truman accordingly.It was agreed that, in the new circumstances, some alterationswould be required in the text of the proposed message from thePrime Minister to General de Gaulle which had been embodied inthe telegram sent to President Truman. As no reply had beenreceived from the President, it would not be possible to inform general de Gaulle that our action was approved by the UnitedStates Government. It also seemed inappropriate to refer to french troops being at liberty to fire in self-defence; and General de Gaulleshould, instead, be invited to &quot; order the French troops to cease fire and withdraw to their barracks.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Secretary of State for War to telegraph atonce to the British Commander-in-Chief in the middle east, directing him to take all the measures which, inhis judgment, were necessary to restore order in the levant States.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toarrange for the immediate despatch, subject to the amendments noted above, of the message from the PrimeMinister to General de Gaulle embodied in the PrimeMinister&apos;s telegram to President Truman, No. 59 of the30th May, 1945.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,31st May, 1945.
