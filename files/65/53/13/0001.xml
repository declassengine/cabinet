Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:CM. (45) 7thConclusions,Minute 1.)air operations.South-east asia.China.Pacific.Japan.naval operations.U-boats.Minesweeping.East Indies.MilitaryOperations.Borneo.Burma.In China operations had been mainly in the Yellow River area and in the Kweilin Changsha Corridor. Two ships had been sunk,and 800 river craft, 290 locomotives and 600 rolling stock destroyed or damaged. 17 United States aircraft had been lost and16 Japanese aircraft destroyed.In the Pacific 18,000 sorties had been flown for the loss of20 aircraft, as against 35 lost by the enemy. The main objectiveshad been airfields, industrial plant and ports. 290 small craft hadbeen destroyed and 400 damaged. In addition, 10,000 tons ofshipping had been sunk in the harbour of Kiirun in Formosa.In the assault on Japan, 4,200 sorties had been flown in12 attacks, for the loss of only 19 aircraft. 64 enemy aircraft were claimed to have been destroyed. A total of 85,000 tons of bombs(including 15,000 tons on Tokyo) had been dropped on Japan todate. This figure compared with a total of 1,300,000 tons (including40,000 tons on Berlin) dropped on Germany.151 U-boats were at present under Allied control and 146 were known to have been scuttled. 119 had not yet been identified, butit was thought that the majority of these had been scuttled.6 U-boats were in Japanese hands in the Far East.About 260 German minesweepers were operating under allied control. 662 mines had been swept by British and German mine-sweepers during the previous week. Large areas in the North Sea(including the Dogger Bank) and in the Western Approaches hadbeen opened for fishing.A force of escort carriers, supported by a cruiser, destroyers anda minesweeper flotilla had left Trincomalee on the 2nd July tosweep mines and carry out bombing attacks and bombardments inthe Nicobar Island area.The Allied occupation of the various zones in Germany hadbeen virtually completed. In Austria, the British had so far onlyoccupied the western portion of their zone and United States forces had not yet completed the occupation of their zone.A total of 3,494,000 displaced persons had been repatriated.A further 2,784,000 still remained to be dealt with.The landing at Brunei had met with considerable success : our line had been extended southwards to Miri and we were pushinginland at Badas. In the southern part of the island australian troops, in their advance westward and towards the oilfields ofSambodjalama, were meeting with increased Japanese resistance in the Manggar area. North of Balikpapan further advances hadbeen made and Dutch troops had crossed a river against opposition3 miles north of the town.In Burma, heavy losses had been inflicted on the Japanese inan offensive which they had undertaken to cover the withdrawalof their troops from the interior.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.[30421-3]1. The Chief s of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious four weeks.The monsoon had severely limited air operations in South-east asia. Sorties had averaged between 500 and 600 a day and 21 air-craft had been lost. Operations had been directed mainly againstthe Japanese retreating from Burma and against shipping in theGulf of Siam. Transport aircraft had carried 14,500 tons of stores ahd 5,000 men. 1
Allied Prisoners 2. The Secretary of State for War recalled that, in accordanceof War in with a decision taken by the Cabinet at their meeting on theJapanese 12th April (W.M. (45) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 1) the British andHands. United States Governments had made a declaration that, if theGerman Government agreed not to withdraw Allied prisoners ofwar into the interior from camps likely to be overrun by theadvancing Anglo-American armies, prisoners released from thosecamps would not subsequently be allowed to take an active partin the war against Germany. The suggestion had now been made that the British and United States Governments might take theinitiative in proposing a similar arrangement in respect ofprisoners of war in Japanese hands. It was desirable that weshould seek to come to such an arrangement with the JapaneseGovernment, as there had already been some instances where theJapanese had massacred Allied prisoners in camps which were likelyto be overrun by Allied forces. If the Cabinet approved thissuggestion, the first step would be to seek the concurrence ofDominion Governments.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for War to arrange for thisproposal to be put to Dominion Governments.Prisoners ofWar.repatriation of italian prisoners.(previous reference:C.M.(45)9thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries recalled that attheir meeting on the 15th June the Cabinet had decided that weshould not take the,, initiative in proposing the repatriation of italian prisoners of war in our hands, and that no Italian prisonersneed be repatriated from this country, at least until after the harvest. He had, therefore, been surprised to see the report of astatement by Count Carandini, the Italian representative in thiscountry, to the effect that Italian prisoners would be repatriatedfrom here as soon as shiping became available. This statement was likely to arouse false hopes among Italian prisoners in this country,and was also disturbing to farmers who were relying on Italianlabour for this year&apos;s harvest.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that CountCarandini had no authority for the statement which he was reportedto have made. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome had alreadybeen asked to report on the matter and, when his report was received,the Foreign Secretary would consider what could be said in thiscountry to correct the misleading impression which had been caused.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.The Future ofTangier.(previous reference:W.M.(45)49thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled thatthe Cabinet had decided, at their meeting on the 23rd April, 1945,that the Soviet Government should not be invited to participate inthe discussions about the future regime for the administration ofthe Tangier Zone. When, however, it became known that these discussions were to be opened, the Soviet Government had formallyasked to be allowed to participate in them. Both the United Statesand the French Governments were in favour of inviting the russians to take part in the discussions.The Foreign Secretary thought that, while it would beimpossible to exclude the Russians from the discussions, it wouldbe preferable to defer giving a definite reply to their request untilthe Three-Power Meeting. It might then be found that our willing-ness to invite them to participate in these discussions could be usedto secure some concession from them on another subject.The Cabinet-Approved the course suggested by the Foreign Secretary
83CM. 13 (45),61Supplies to 5. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the PresidentGermany and 0f the Board of Trade and Minister of Production (CP. (45) 44)Liberated regarding the supply of food-stuffs and fuel from Eastern EuropeAreas. to Western Germany and to the liberated areas in the Anglo-Supplies from American sphere of responsibility.Eastern Tfie President of the Board of Trade said that his Memorandumope. covered two related points.First, he thought it important that it should be made clear atthe. Three-Power Meeting that the surplus areas in Eastern europe which were now under Russian control should not only meet theirown requirements, but should also make a contribution to the needsof Western Europe. So far as concerned foodstuffs, it might wellbe found that there was no surplus for export from Eastern Europe;but, even though the Russians might make no contribution to theneeds of the West, there would be advantage in forestalling any demand for supplies to these eastern areas. And it was clear thatthere would be a substantial surplus of coal, from which some con-tribution should be made towards the needs of Western Europe.Secondly, he thought it should be borne in mind that any food-stuffs supplied by U.N.R.R.A. to Poland and Czechoslovakia wouldin effect contribute towards Russia&apos;s needs in Eastern Europe.These claims by U.N.R.R.A. could not be rejected outright; but he recommonded that our representatives on the Combined boards should be instructed to see that the claims were subjected to a thorough scrutiny and that it was made clear to U.N.R.R.A. thattheir contribution must be regarded as supplementing the supplies which were available locally. U.N.R.R.A. should keep it in mind,in making their plans for relief in this area, that the food surplusareas in Eastern Europe should make some contribution to the needs&apos;   of Western Germany and of liberated areas in Western Europe.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that inthe discussions on this subject at the Three-Power Meeting, weshould seek to establish two main principles (a) that, for purposes of supplies as for purposes of reparation,both Germany and Austria should be treated as a singleeconomic unit;(b) that, in the absence of special reasons to the contrary, eachof the separate Zones of Occupation should draw their supplies from the areas on which they had drawn beforethe war.We should seek to secure agreement that the Control Commis-sions in the two countries should base their supply organisation on these two principles. The second of these principles should beapplied, not only to foodstuffs, but also to fuel and fertilisers.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would suggest to thePrime Minister that an attempt should be made at theThree-Power Meeting to secure agreement to the twoprinciples outlined at (a) and (6) above.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrangefor the British representatives on the Combined Boardsto be instructed to see that U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s requirements for Poland and Czechoslovakia were subjected to a thorough scrutiny and that supplies provided by .N.RR.A. were regarded as supplementary to thoseavailable locally.Future of the assyrians.[30421-3]6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary.of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 11) inviting theCabinet to consider whether our future policy should be based onthe assumption that the Assyrians now in Iraq and Syria wouldhave to remain where they are or whether a determined attempt should now be made to settle them outside the Middle East.b 3
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the first alternative that the Assyrians in Iraq and Syria should remainwhere they were was not a satisfactory solution, given the risk towhich they would be exposed of future conflicts with the Muslimsin Iraq. On the other hand, the experience of the past ten years had shown the difficulty of finding a new home for the Assyriansoutside the Middle East. The Dominion Governments were notprepared to accept them, and the difficulties of settlement in theColonial Empire would also be very grave. We were, however,under great obligation to the Assyrians and he felt that we shouldmake a further effort to find a home for them.In discussion the following points were made :  (a) The Secretary of State for the Colonies confirmed that therewas no prospect of finding a home for the Assyrians in any of theColonies.(b) The Secretary of State for India suggested that it mightbe possible to accommodate them in Northern Baluchistan. It wassuggested that there might be difficulty in settling a Christiancommunity among the Muslims of Baluchistan.(c) It was suggested that, despite the objection which LordMoyne had previously seen to the settlement of the Assyrians inthe conquered Italian colonies, further consideration might begiven to the possibility of settling them in Eritrea or Cyrenaica.It was of particular importance that we should establish our influence in Cyrenaica; and it would be useful if the Assyrianscould be employed there as guards for British airfields and allowedto found a settlement for their families in the neighbourhood of the airfields. They had proved their worth as levies; and their employ-ment in this capacity might warrant their being given a neighbouring area in which to found a settlement. Such anarrangement might, however, cause trouble with the Sennusi; andthis point would need to be watched.(d) The Secretary of State for India also suggested that the assyrians might be settled in the Lebanon, where a Christiancommunity would be more welcome. Such a settlement might wellbe politically attractive to the Lebanese, though possibly unwelcome to the Assyrians.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toascertain the views of the Minister Resident, middle east, and the Minister in the Levant States on thepossibilities of settling the Assyrians in Eritrea,Cyrenaica or the Lebanon.(2) Asked the Secretary of State for India to ascertain theviews of the Government of India on the possibility of settling the Assyrians in Baluchistan.Housing.Occupation ofEmpty Houses..(Previous -Reference:CM. (45) 11thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. At their meeting on the 6th July the Cabinet had authorised the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State forScotland to take any further action necessary to ensure that themaximum use was made of any empty houses for the accommodation of families inadequately housed.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that thisquestion had been considered at a meeting of the Housing Squadon the 9th July when it had been agreed that, subject to theconfirmation of the Cabinet, local authorities should now be instructed that, in requisitioning empty houses for use by personsinadequately housed, they should give the owner not more thanone week in which to occupy the house, himself or by his family, andshould not give him an opportunity to negotiate for a sale or a lease.In discussion it was suggested that in certain circumstancesone week might be unreasonably short notice.   It was also felt that
85 CM. 13 (45);local authorities should not be allowed to rely merely on posting -a notice informing the owner that the house would be requisitionedin a week&apos;s time, but should be required actually to establish contact with the owner and to give him a period of ten days from thatdate within which he might arrange to occupy the house, eitherhimself or by his family. It was also agreed that no announce-ment on this subject should be made until after the 12th July.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service tocommunicate their views to the Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for Scotland and to arrange for themto instruct local authorities, not earlier than the 12th July,in the sense indicated above.Educational 8.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theand Cultural Minister of Education (CP. (45) 68), reporting that the ConferenceOrganisation of of Allied Ministers of Education called together in 1942 on thethe United initiative of His Majesty&apos;s Government had drafted a constitutionNations. for a continuing organisation for co-operation in the educational and cultural fields. The draft was to be considered, and finaldocuments prepared, at a meeting of the Allied Ministers onThursday, the 12th July. The next step proposed by the Confer-ence was a meeting in London in November of representatives ofthe Governments of the United Nations, and the Conference had asked His Majesty&apos;s Government to support a motion by the UnitedStates representative calling such a meeting.The Minister of Education invited the Cabinet to authorise him to inform the Conference, when it met on the 12th July, thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were willing to call a United nations conference in London, on the lines proposed in CP. (45) 68, in theautumn. The matter was urgent since the French were showingsigns of intending to call a rival conference in Paris. There would,of course, be no question of any formal adoption of the proposedconstitution by His Majesty&apos;s Government or of any financial commitment to the proposed new organisation without priorreference to the Cabinet. The Foreign Office were strongly infavour of the action proposed.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal put forward by the Minister ofEducation in CP. (45) 68 and authorised him to proceed accordingly.India.constitutional position.(previous reference erence:CM. (45) 6thConclusions,Minute 3.)9. The Cabinet had before them telegrams from the viceroy to the Secretary of State for India (Nos. 182SC and 183SC of the9th July) giving his appreciation of the stage which had beenreached in his discussions with political leaders in India.Mr. Jinnah had refused to submit a list of possible members forthe Executive Council in the absence of an assurance, which he regarded as of fundamental importance and which the Viceroy wasnot prepared to give, that all Muslim members of Council would be selected from the League. It was, on the other hand, important that the Conference should not break down before every possibleeffort has been made to secure agreement. The Viceroy had, there-fore, himself made provisional selections for an Executive Councilin accordance with the original plan, using his own judgmentabout Muslim League representation. He asked approval for putting these proposals first to Mr. Jinnah, and then to other leaders, at a series of short interviews, so arranged as to avoiddisclosure by Mr. Jinnah of the names before the list had been seen by all the leaders. The Viceroy would, at these interviews, con-sider any modifications that might be suggested by the leaders,and would refer them to the Secretary of State before committing
himself. If the League and Congress agreed, the settlement wouldbe announced at a meeting of the Conference on the 14th July.If either, or both, rejected his list he would tell them that he wouldmake a statement at the Conference. In the statement he proposedto inform the Conference of the breakdown, reviewing the courseof events, and disclosing the names he had put forward butdeclining to be drawn as to his further intentions and saying thathe would make a broadcast statement within a few days.The Secretary of State for India said that the immediate point,and the only one on which the instructions of the Cabinet were required, was whether the Viceroy should be allowed to put his list,as he proposed, to Mr. Jinnah and the other leaders. The varioussubsidiary questions which Lord Wavell had raised as to the line to be taken if the negotiations broke down could most conveniently be considered by the India Committee if and when the occasionarose. He himself was strongly in favour of the course recom-mended by the Viceroy, which he thought consistent with the viewpreviously taken by the Cabinet.In discussion the following points were raised: (a) The Lord Chancellor suggested that the Viceroy&apos;s latestproposal was not, in fact, in accordance with the original plan. Ithad been the essence of that plan that the Viceroy should invite theprincipal political parties to let him have lists of possible namesfrom which a Council could be formed, so that the names putforward would be approved by the communities from which they came. Now, however, one of the two principal parties had refusedto put forward any list at all; but the Viceroy, despite that, proposedto go ahead with a list of his own.(b) The Secretary of State for War thought that a fundamentalissue arose on the question whether we could look for theco-operation of the Muslim League. It was essential to avoid any new Council starting off with the Muslim League in a free positionand hostile. We risked losing our friends without getting anysecurity that the resultant arrangements would in fact be workable.(c) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked whetherit would meet the case if the Viceroy were in the first instance to put to Mr. Jinnah privately a list of the Muslims which he had it inmind to recommend, and invite Mr. Jinnah either to accept this listor to put it forward as his own.(d) Would it be possible, if the Viceroy were to act as in (c), to decline to allow him to make a corresponding communication to theCongress, to whose list he proposed himself to make certainadditions ?It was pointed out that Congress had submitted a list of names,and appeared to be ready to co-operate within the terms of the Vice-roy&apos;s offer. The first step must be to ascertain whether or not wecould secure the support of, and a list from, the Muslim League.We should avoid a situation in which the Muslim League could beheld up as the one obstacle to progress. Would it not in thesecircumstances be better to refrain from consultation with theCongress until we knew where we stood with the Muslim League?(e.) Some doubts were expressed about the Viceroy&apos;s proposalsfor the distribution of portfolios. The Secretary of State for War,in particular, felt that His Majesty&apos;s Government must remainentirely uncommitted as regards the assignment of portfoliospending further examination of the Viceroy&apos;s list.(/) It was suggested that the Viceroy had done very well sofar, and that there was much to be said, in the circumstances now before the Cabinet, for accepting honourable failure if that provedinevitable, and in that event concentrating on the second course recommended by Lord Wavell in paragraph 6 of his telegram 182SC,viz., reconstruction of an &quot; efficiency   Council on a smaller basis.
Summing up the discussion, The Foreign Secretary said that itwas the general sense of the Cabinet that the Viceroy should, inthe first instance, communicate to Mr. Jinnah privately the Muslimnames which he had it in mind to put forward for appointment tothe Council and endeavour to persuade him to put these namesforward, or at least accept them, as his list. If Mr. Jinnah agreed,the Viceroy could immediately inform Congress of the changes which he wished to make in their list. If, on the other hand,Mr. Jinnah did not accept, the Viceroy should report to the cabinet before taking any further action.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for India to telegraph tothe Viceroy in the terms of the draft set out in the annex to these minutes.Cabinet Of/ice, S.W.1.10th July, 1945.ANNEX.Draft Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy.The Cabinet feels some difficulty in your latest scheme because it was the essence of the plan that you should have before you lists of names proposed by congress and Muslim League respectively. As things turn out you have no listfrom Muslim League. Cabinet suggest therefore that you should see Jinnahand tell him the Muslim names which you would favour and try to persuadeJinnah to agree to put forward names. If Jinnah agrees to put forward oraccept your suggestions as his list, we agree that you should at once proceed toshow Congress your alterations in their list.If Jinnah does not agree, Cabinet would like you to report back before taking any further action. The Cabinet admire the skill with which you have handledthe situation.
