India. 1.   The Cabinet had before them a Report by the IndiaConstitutional Committee (W.P. (45) 274) on the constitutional position in India,Position. to which was appended the draft of a statement which, subject(Previous to the approval of the Cabinet, might be made in Parliament by the reference:      Secretary of State for India.W.M.(45)56th The Cabinet were reminded that there had already been conclusions.) preliminary discussion by the Coalition Government of this Reportby the India Committee. The Committee of Ministers, of all parties, which had examined this matter on behalf of the coalition government had agreed that, if any further step was to be taken at  his stage in respect of&quot; India &apos;s constitutional problem, thestatement appended to that Report represented the best course that could be taken. Some members of that Committee had grave doubts as to the wisdom of taking any step at this stage, evenon the modified lines proposed by the Report. On the other hand,there would be great advantages if the Indian problem could bedealt with in a way which would command support from all political parties and would avoid its becoming an issue at theElection, and this was a strong argument for making a statement inParliament on the lines. recommended by the Committee.The Secretary of State^ for India said that the Viceroy wouldbe willing to accept the statement appended to the Report as hismandate for discussion on return to India. It was, of course, thecase that the proposals now put forward were strictly conditional on their acceptance by the main political parties in India. Therewas no question of negotiation, and the statement represented a firm offer not to be extended by any negotiation on the Viceroy&apos;part. If the Indian political parties did not take advantage ofthis firm offer, we should carry on as now, but with the advantage from the point of view of public opinion in this country and abroadthat we should clearly have gOne to the utmost limits in the offerwe had put forward. In reply to a question, he confirmed that theoffer, if accepted, would not involve any disclosure of secret military matters to the Viceroy&apos;s Council, Or any interference with the discretion of the Viceroy and Commander-in-Chief in operationalmatters.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat a statement should be made by the Secretary of State forIndia in terms of, the draft appended to W.P. (45) 274, and thatthe Viceroy should treat that statement as his mandate on the specific understanding that it represented a firm offer which wasnot open to any extension by negotiation.The Cabinet then proceeded to consider certain supplementarymatters referred to by the India Committee in connection with theproposed statement, as follows: .Indianisation of the Army.The India Committee had expressed the view that, if the recom-mendation put forward by the Secretary of State for India andthe Commander-in-Chief in India for the future officering of theIndian armed services55 was accepted, an announcement should bemade at the same time as any statement on the -(constitutional problem.The Prime Minister said that he saw the strongest objectionto making any statement at this stage as &quot;regards the futureofficering of the Indian Army. The matter was one that requiredmuch closer investigation, pending which he thought it would be wiser that the Cabinet should not commit themselves.It was the view of the Cabinet that no public reference shouldbe made at this stage to the further Indianisation of the indian army. .External Affairs.The India Committee had recommended that it should bemade clear in the statement by the Secretary of State in Parlia-ment, as, also by the Viceroy in any statement which he made in
3CM. 1 (45).India, that the delegates of British India at the Peace conference or at other international conferences, would be chosen by theGovernment of India, consequent on the appointment of an IndianMember of Council in charge of&quot; the Portfolio of external affairs.The Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State and theViceroy in their respective statements should make it clear thatthe Delegates of British India at future international conferenceswould be chosen by the new Government of India.Appointment of a United Kingdom High Commissioner in India.The Cabinet approved the recommendation of the india committee that a United Kingdom High Commissioner should beappointed in India to represent the particular interests of thiscountry, and that an announcement to that effect should be madeby the Secretary of State in his speech in the House of Commons.Release of Certain Political Detainees.The India Committee had recommended that the Secretaryof State should make it clear, if the proposals outlined in theReport were accepted by the Indian leaders, that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be prepared to recommend the Central and provincial authorities. in India to consider favourably the releaseof persons  till detained as the result of the Congress resolution of August 1942,It was the view of the Cabinet that the Viceroy should say nothing about the release of detainees when he went back to India;but that, if the Congress leaders wanted any individual released for purposes of discussing the offer of His Majesty&apos;s Government,the Viceroy should have discretion to release him and would notthereafter return him to confinement. The balance of thedetainees would not, however, be released unless and until the offer which was now put forward had been accepted by the indian political parties and the Central and Provincial authorities responsible were agreeable to releasing them.India. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a Report by the India Com-Industrialisation mittee (W.P. (45) 317) on certain proposals by the Government ofand Commercial India bearing on the commercial discrimination provisions of theDiscrimination. Government of India Act, 1935. Sir A. Dalai, a member of theGovernor-General&apos;s Executive Council for Planning and Develop-ment had been sent to this country by the Government of India inorder, inter alia, to discuss these proposals. The Committee&apos;srecommendations were as follows : (i) While they felt doubts about the soundness of theseproposals for the industrialisation of India, they did notthink that it would be wise for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to reject them entirely,(ii) There could be no question, in present circumstances, ofany repeal of the commercial discrimination provisionsof the Government of India Act, and this should be made clear to Sir A. Dalai.(iii) Discussions with Sir A. Dalai should be undertaken on thebasis of the formula set out in paragraph 16 of theReport.(iv) The discussions with Sir A. Dalai should be held by ministers, not by officials.The Lord Chancellor said that the recommendations of the india committee were unanimous save that the Secretary of State forWar was not in agreement with the recommendations summarised at (i) and (iii) above. This issue had figured very prominently inthe debates in Parliament culminating in the passage of the Govern-ment of India Act, 1935; and the object of these sections of the[30143-1] b 2
Act had been to give*f ull and effective protection to United kingdom interests in India. He himself felt considerable doubt on thismatter, the more so as enquiries showed that British commercial interests attached very great importance to the maintenance of thisprotection so long as India was not fully self-governing, but he was prepared to accept the recommendations in the Report.In discussion the following points were made: (a) It would be out of the question to make any concession inrespect of the commercial discrimination provisions of the Act of1935 in advance of negotiations with India on the sterling balances.(6) The. Government of India&apos;s proposals were a furtherinstance of endeavours on the part of business interests under Hinduinfluence to establish a dominating position in India without the slightest regard for the true interests of the Indian masses.(c) The Secretary of State for India suggested that recom-mendation (iv) might be modified to admit of discussions at theofficial level between Sir A. Dalai and officials of the India Officeto ascertain what difficulties he expected to arise from the mainten-ance of the commercial discrimination provisions of the Act.The Cabinet were, however, opposed to any modification of theCommittee&apos;s recommendation on this point.(d) The following amendments were suggested, and accepted bythe Secretary of State for India, in the $formula recommended bythe India Committee in paragraph 16 of their Report for adoptionas a basis for any discussions with Sir A. Dalai: -In the first line the words &apos;&apos; at this stage&apos;&apos; should be omitted.The second paragraph of the formula should be omitted.In summing up the discussion The Prime Minister said thatthere should be no detailed negotiations with Sir A. Dalai on thesematters at the present time; and he should be told that in view ofthe forthcoming Election the Government were not in a positionto explore in any detail proposals which raised such far-reachingquestions. There could be no question of coming to any arrangement with Sir A. Dalai, and no hope should be held out to him of any revision of the commercial discrimination provisions of the Govern-ment of India Act. It was against this background that (in discus-sions with Sir A. Dalai) use might be made, with the greatestcaution and subject to the amendments noted above, of the formulaset out in paragraph 16 of W.P. (45)317.The Cabinet-(1) Approved   the   recommendations   made   in   sub-para-. graphs (i), (ii) and (iv) of paragraph 17 of the Reportof the India Committee, as summarised at (i), (ii) and(iv) above.(2) As regards the remaining recommendation, summarised at(iii) above, agreed that the Secretary of State for india should proceed as indicated by the Prime Minister insumming up the discussion.War Crimes. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum on War(PreviousCriminals (W.P. (45) 313), which had been circulated by Sir DonaldReference:      Somervell when Attorney-General.  The Annex to this memorandum .M. (45) 57th set out the text of a draft agreement, submitted by Judge RosenmannConclusions,    on behalf of the United States Government, proposing the establish-Minute 2.)     ment of an inter-Allied court for the trial of major war criminals,their principal agents and accessories, and all other offenders whowere not sent back for trial to the countries in which their crimeswere committed.   Subject to an amendment of the proposed defini-tion of war crimes, which was -set out in paragraph 2 of theMemorandum, it was proposed that this draft should be accepted in principle as a basis for discussion with Justice Robert Jackson,
5 CM. 1 (45).a Judge of the United States Supreme Court, who had arrived inthis country as United States representative on the inter-Alliedbody which was to prepare for the prosecution of war criminalsbefore the inter-Allied court.The main points in discussion were (a) The Attorney-General pointed out that under the draft agreement major war criminals would be tried before the inter-Allied court-a point on which the War Cabinet had previously feltmisgiving. In preparing the draft agreement, however, the UnitedStates authorities had gone a long way to meet the objectionspreviously raised on this point on behalf of the War Cabinet; theyshowed no disposition to favour a large number of State trials of major war criminals; and the procedure now proposed in the draft agreement was carefully designed to prevent the accused from using the court as a platform from which to voice political views andarguments.(6) In paragraph 3 of the Memorandum, the question was raised whether all the members of the inter-Allied court should bemilitary officers. The view of the Cabinet was that the british members of the court should be eminent lawyers who, if necessary,might for this purpose be specially commissioned in His Majesty&apos;forces.(c) The A attorney-General said that charges against over 150minor war criminals had been prepared and were ready forhearing; and he asked whether the Secretary of State for War couldexpedite the issue of the Royal Warrant prescribing the procedure to be followed by our military courts in dealing with war crimes,so that progress could be made with the cases which were ready forhearing.The Secretary of State for War said that he was advised thatthe proposals in W.P. (45) 313 might involve some alteration of theprocedure proposed as regards prosecutions relating to offences committed in concentration camps in Germany.The A attorney-General said that he was not aware that any suchalterations would be required.The Cabinet agreed that this point should be determined inaccordance with the considered views of the Law Officers.(d) The Prime Minister said that the support of public opinion in this country for the punishment of war criminals might bereduced if the number of persons charged with war crimes becamevery large. He asked the Attorney-General to keep this point inmind and to bring it again to the notice of the Cabinet if thenumber of persons charged with war crimes seemed likely to becomeexcessive.The Cabinet-Agreed that the draft agreement annexed to W.P. (45) 313might be accepted in principle as a basis for discussionwith the representatives appointed by Allied governments to prepare for the prosecution of war criminals.Japan.Belief supplies for Prisonersof War andInternees.(previous reference:W.M.(44)47thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for War (W.P. (45) 303) suggesting that the JapaneseGovernment should be invited to agree (i) that we should provide a cargo ship, to be used exclusivelyfor the transport of Red Cross relief supplies for prisoners of warand civilian internees (from the British Commonwealth,,the UnitedStates and Netherlands territories) in Japanese hands; and, onreturn journeys, for Japanese prisoners and internees; and(ii) that we should grant safe conduct to this ship, manned bya Japanese crew, and should agree to her picking up tine supplies atGoa.
5. The Prime Minister said that, at a meeting of ministers on the previous evening, he had discussed the suggestion made inthe Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Depart-ment and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (45) 2) thattolling- Day might be postponed to a date later than 5th July incertain constituencies where a large proportion of the electorswould be away from their homes on that date as a result of Wakesand similar trade holidays. The difficulty would be most acute incertain constituencies in Lancashire, where the Wake week would run from 1st July to 7th July; but it would also arise in other areas, e.g., in certain Scottish towns where trade holidays would run for a week from 30tih June.At the meeting on the previous evening the Home secretary had undertaken to make immediate enquiries in order to establishwhich were the constituencies which would be affected by theseholidays; and, if agreement could be reached between the leaders ofthe main political Parties, it was proposed that a short Bill shouldbe passed providing that in these constituencies, which would be specified in a Schedule, the Returning Officer should have discretion to postpone the Polling Day to a date not later than 12th July.Alternatively, the Bill might provide that in all these constituenciesthe Poll should be held on 12th July, if that date would accord withthe trade holidays in all the areas affected.The Prime Minister said that, if the Home Secretary&apos;senquiries could be completed in time, he would make a statement onthis subject in the House of Commons on Thursday, 31st May.The Cabinet--Took note, with approval, of the lines on which the PrimeMinister was proposing to deal with the questions raised in CP. (45) 2.Empire Tele- 6.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in accordanceCommunioa- with the decision of the War Cabinet on 16th April, 1945, thetions. Dominion Governments had been invited to send representatives to commonwealth a Conference in London on Empire Telecommunications.    TheConference. Governments of Canada and South Africa had now intimated that(Previous their representatives could arrive in London in time for this reference: Conference to begin on 11th July. He would like to arrange for theWM (45) 46th Conference to commence on, or soon after, that date unless theConclusions Cabinet considered that this would be inconvenient in view of the minute 5.) date 0^ tne General Election.The Cabinet(1) Approved the proposal of the Chancellor of the exchequer that this Conference should open in London on, or soon after, lltJh- July, 1945.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange thatthe documents which were being prepared for theConference should be submitted to Ministers before theywere circulated to Dominion Governments.GeneralElection.postponement of Pollingin certainConstituencies.It was explained that this proposal had already been approved in principle by representatives of the Dominion Governments andthe Government of India. If it were approved by the Cabinet, itwould be communicated to the United States Government before being transmitted to the Japanese through the Swiss Government,and the United States Government would be allowed a reasonableinterval to offer any comment. The proposal would be similarlycommunicated, in advance, to the Netherlands Government.The Cabinet-Approved ihi proposals set out in paragraph 7 of w.P. (45) 303, as summarised above.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that therehad been consultatiens with the leaders of the Labour Party on the list of Bills which might be passed into law before the dissolution of Parliament; and he was now anxious to reach final decisions onthe Legislative Programme so that a statement oould be made inthe House of Commons on the following day.The Cabinets-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to settle, in consultationwith - the Chief Whip and the Ministers principally concerned, the terms of the statement to be made in theHouse of Commons on the following day regarding thelegislation which the Government hoped to pass into law before the Dissolution.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Wth May, 1945.Parliament.legislative programme for theRemainder ofthe Session.
