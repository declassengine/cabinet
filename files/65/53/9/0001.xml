1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland(CP. (45) 32) regarding the changes which they proposed to make,as a result of their discussions with the interested parties, in theplan for a National Health Service which had been outlined in theWhite Paper (Cmd. 6502) presented to Parliament by the coalition government in February 1944.The Health Ministers sought authority to announce these changes in general terms, before the Election, and to state that itwas the Governments intention to introduce legislation early inthe new Parliament to give effect to the modified scheme.The Minister of Health said that, if no such announcement weremade, it would be alleged that the present Government intended to withhold or delay the introduction of a National Health Service. Infact, substantial progress had been made in the discussions withthe interested parties, and the modified scheme which he and theSecretary of State for Scotland had now put forward was likelyto command a large measure of support from doctors, localauthorities (except the London County Council) and voluntary hospitals. The original scheme had included a number of featureswhich had aroused opposition from the interested parties, and itwas desirable to make it clear before the Election that the present government were prepared to modify these features of the plan.It was undesirable that candidates supporting the Governmentshould be left m the position of having to defend at the Electionthose proposals in the original White Paper which the health ministers were now prepared to modify.In reply to questions raised in the discussion, The Minister ofHealth said that the main changes now proposed could be broadlydescribed under six heads. First, the planning of the health ser-vices would be shared between the local authorities and expertsrepresenting both the hospitals and the doctors. Second, therewould be regional advisory bodies based on the wider areasinfluenced by the medical schools of the universities. Third, thelocal authorities would retain responsibility for the administrationof their hospitals, instead of being required to transfer them toJoint Boards. Fourth, there would be no &quot; direction &quot; of doctors and no central employment of doctors by a Central Medical Board.Fifth, the basis of payments to voluntary hospitals from localpublic funds would be modified in a way which would be more acceptable to the voluntary hospitals. Sixth, the new proposals wentbeyond those of the original White Paper in the dental and ophthalmic services to be provided and also in the provision of aidsfor the deaf.In further discussion The Prime Minister said that in pre-senting these new proposals emphasis should be laid on the needfor providing improved means of making available to general prac-practitioners information about the most up-to-date-methods of treat-ment and the latest results of medical research, and generally for raising the standard of knowledge and technical skill among general practitioners.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the changes set out in the Appendix to cp. (45) 32 might be announced in general terms inspeeches to be made by the Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for Scotland early in the following week.(2) Decided that these changes should also be described in a written statement to be published on behalf of theGovernment after the first public announcement hadbeen made by the Health Ministers.(3) Invited the Minister of Health and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to submit the draft of such a statement forapproval by the Prime Minister.national health service.(previous reference:W.M.(44)21stConclusions,Minute 2.)
Prisonersof War.(previous reference erence:The Minister of Education said that the United States Govern-Conclusions ment, without consultation with us, had decided to repatriate someMinute 3 ) &apos; 33,000 Italian prisoners of war in shipments of 10,000, startingearly in July. He thought it important, for political reasons, thatwe should conform to this decision. We should obtain great creditwith the Italian Government if we at once agreed in principle that italian prisoners of war in British hands should be repatriated as and when opportunities arose and replacements of german prisoners of war could be made available. Transport difficulties would, in practice, prevent us from undertaking any large-scalerepatriation for some time to come.The Cabinet were informed that the repatriation at this timeof any Italian prisoners employed in agriculture would have veryserious effects on home food production. Co-operators, who were employed singly on farms, could not at present be replaced by german prisoners; and to select for repatriation the other prisonerswould be, not only unfair, but likely to give rise to trouble with theco-operators. The Cabinet were also informed that, in view of theman-power shortage, it would be most undesirable to repatriate atthis stage any of the Italian prisoners employed in the building orfood processing industries.The Prime Minister said that, in the circumstances disclosed in the discussion, it would be inexpedient for us to take any initiative-tive in this matter. We should await an approach by the ItalianGovernment and, when that was made, should deal with the matterthrough the diplomatic, not the military, channel. In his view,it was unnecessary for us to hasten to make any concession tomeet the views of the Italian Government on this question: andno Italian prisoners need be repatriated from this country at least until after the harvest.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Foreign Office should deal with thisquestion on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.GeneralElection.TravelFacilitiesfor Ministers.(previous reference erence:CM. (45) 7thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. At their meeting on the 11th June the Cabinet had invited the Law Officers to consider the position under the electoral law which would result from making Service aircraft or other officialtravel facilities available for Ministers for journeys in connectionwith the- Election. The Cabinet now had before them a note bythe Attorney-General (CP. (45) 37) with which the Solicitor-General and the Solicitor-General for Scotland agreed.The view was put forward in discussion that there would bemuch to be said for the view that during an Election ministers could be regarded as normally resident in their constituencies; andthat it was appropriate that they should be able to use Govern-ment aircraft in order to enable them to return to London quicklyto perform their official duties; but that it would not be right toallow Government aircraft to be used by a Minister or ex-Ministermaking a tour of the country for electioneering purposes.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the real justification for permitting Ministers to use aircraft during an Election wasthe saving of time involved and that it was difficult to relate thissaving of time realistically to the purpose of particular journeys.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had told the Leader of the Opposition that it was the intention to treat2. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Minister ofEducation (CP. (45) 20) regarding the repatriation of italian prisoners of war.
those members of the Opposition who had been Ministers in the coalition Government on the same basis in this matter as those now holding office as Ministers of Cabinet rank.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Air to prepare and submit to the Prime Minister a note on this matter, defining the journeys on which Government aircraft could be pro-vided and the procedure to be followed.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th June, 1945.
