Germany. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary of StateFood and Fuel for War (CP. (45) 70) covering a telegram from the Britishfor Berlin.      Commander-in-Chief in Germany regarding the supply of food and fuel for Berlin.The Secretary of. State for War explained that at a meeting which the British and American representatives had held with marshal Zhukov, on the 7th July, it had been made clear that theRussians had assumed that each of the Powers occupying sectors inBerlin would be responsible for feeding the Germans in their sector.This would involve us, on the Russian estimates, in supplying and distributing about 20,000 tons a month of various categories offood-stuffs. The Russians had also assumed that similar arnange-ments would be made about coal. They estimated the total require-ment for Berlin (for public utilities, &amp;c, and not including anydomestic requirements) at 7,500 tons a day; and they were likely toask that the British and American authorities should make them-selves responsible for providing 5,000 tons a day.On both points discussion with the Russians were to be resumed at a meeting to be held in Berlin that afternoon. TheSecretary of State for War said that he had discussed the position with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and they consideredthat, subject to the views of the Cabinet, the right course for theBritish and United States representatives (General Weeks andGeneral Clay) to take at the meeting was to accept responsibilityfor providing these supplies for one month, as an interim arrange-ment, until the long-term policy could be discussed at the Three-Power Meeting. It was clearly essential to avoid a situation arisingat the Three-Power Meeting in which it could be alleged that wewere leaving the populations in our sectors of Berlin to starve.As regards food, the month&apos;s requirements for the British and united States sectors together was 41,000 tons. Against this general Clay could supply from the United States stock-pile 20,000tons of flour, 18,000 tons of potatoes, 672 tons of salt and 850 tonsof sugar. Two trains a day to Berlin would be involved. If thisprovision were made, it would see us through until well after theThree-Power Meeting, at which the long-term policy could beconsidered. It was not proposed to provide any supplies of meator fats; and care would be taken to see that the scale of rations forthe German population did not exceed that available in liberated areas.General Weeks had been given provisional instructions to join with General Clay in accepting responsibility for providing suppliesX &quot; I of food, as above, for the British and United States sectors of Berlinfor one month only, as an interim arrangement pending thediscussion of long-term policy at the Three-Power Meeting.As regards coal, the Cabinet were informed that before thewar Berlin had drawn half its supplies from Silesia, but theRussians had stated that no Silesian coal would be available for germany. The quantities which the Russians were asking theBritish and United States authorities to supply to Berlin wouldmake la substantial inroad into the supplies which it was hoped toprovide for the liberated areas from the Ruhr&quot;. It seemed likely that the only long-term solution would be to secure a substantial increase in the production of the Ruhr mines. On the short-term problem, we should not find it possible, in practice, to supply any appreciable amount of coal to Berlin within the next month : apartfrom difficulties of supply, it would be impracticable to transportcoal to Berlin during the next few weeks, for the bridge atMagdeburg would not be open until near the end of this month.At the same time, as General Clay had undertaken to find the food supplies required during this interim period for both the Britishand United States sectors, it was desirable that General Weeksshould undertake to explore the possibilities of finding somesupplies of coal. General Weeks had been given provisionalinstructions to this effect, and had also been instructed to propose the immediate appointment of the military organisation for suoer-vising coal production in Germany, which had been approved by
the Cabinet at their meeting on the 15th June (CM. (45) 8th Con-elusions, Minute 6).The Cabinets (1) Endorsed the provisional instructions which had been givento General Weeks, as summarised at &quot; X &quot; and &quot; Y &quot;above, regarding the line to be taken in further dis-cussions about the supply of food and fuel for Berlin.(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs would consult with the Secretary of State for Warregarding the arrangements to be made to ensure thatexpert advice was available to the British delegation atthe Three-Power Meeting on questions of supplies foroccupied Germany and for liberated areas and onrelated economic issues.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,10th July, 1945.
