Syria andthe Lebanon.(previous reference:W.M.(45)58thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Prime Minister drew the attention of the Cabinet tothe latest telegrams on the situation in Syria and the. Lebanon.There had been a serious deterioration in the last twenty-four hours,and the position was now grave. The French had again bombardedDamascus; and there had been serious loss of life and destructionof property. General Paget had reported that, in his view, GeneralOliva Roget was wholly irresponsible and that the French authori-ties either could not, or would not, control him; and he had raised the question of taking control himself of all troops in the Levant.The Prime Minister said that before these latest developmentshe had, in consultation with the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, approved a telegram asking General de Gaulle to come toLondon to discuss the position; but in the present circumstances he felt that it would no longer he appropriate to send this telegram.More urgent action was now required to bring the situation under control. &quot;We must, however, be at pains to avoid being manoeuvredinto a position in which we had to carry single-handed the wholeof the burden of setting matters right. It was, in his view, of theutmost importance that we should carry the United States with us and should get them publicly to declare their support for our action and perhaps even send a token force to assist our troops.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that thesituation had passed the point at which it could be dealt with bydiplomatic negotiation with General de Gaulle. Forcible interven-tion on the spot now seemed inevitable; but he agreed that weshould seek to ensure the support of the United States Government.He proposed that we should at once address a strong note to theUnited States Government saying that neither we nor they couldtolerate the continuance of this situation in Syria, which threatenedour lines of communication with the Far East, and we asked fortheir full support in intervening locally to restore order, if necessary by force. In the last resort we might have to intervene withoutUnited States support: for special British interests were at stake in a situation which might involve a conflagration throughout theMiddle East. If it were seen that we were powerless to preventthe French from (persisting in their irresponsible conduct, our influence throughout the whole of the Middle East would be under-mined. None the less, he agreed that we should attempt to secureUnited States backing if we could, and he saw good reason to hope&apos;that it would be forthcoming. Apart from the military interestsof the United States Government in preserving the Allied lines ofcommunication to the Far East, via Egypt and the Suez Canal, the guarantees which had been given of the independence of the LevantStates produced a very clear issue for public opinion in the UnitedStates.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The forces under British control in Syria and adjoiningareas should be sufficiently strong to deal with the &quot;situation. Itwas most undesirable, on the other hand, that force should have tobe used against our Allies. &quot;We should aim at getting the french to order their troops to withdraw to their barracks and thereafter to conform to the directions of the British Commander-in-Chief,Middle East.(&amp;) Under the Lyttelton-de Gaulle Agreement, the british commander-in-Chief in the Middle East was responsible in the last resort for maintaining order in this area. It was of greatimportance that, given our position in the Arab world, the middle east should not feel that His Majesty&apos;s Government had donenothing to assist Syria and the Lebanon against French &quot;aggression.We could be certain of the full support of the local population inany action that we might take to remedy the present situation.After further discussion, the Prime Minister said that the sense of the Cabinet was in favour of making an approach in the firstinstance to President Truman to ensure that we should have thesupport of the United States in firm action to restore order in Syria

He suggested to the Cabinet the terms of atelegram to the President inviting his support for a message whichhe would propose to send to General de Gaulle (i) informing him that the British Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, had been ordered to intervene to prevent further bloodshed, and (ii) callingon him to order the French troops to withdraw ,to their barracks and thereafter to cease fire except in self-defence..The Prime Minister asked that the War Office should at onceinform the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, of the sense of the message which was being sent to President Truman and should instruct him to prepare to take .action accordingly. General Pagetshould also be informed that he was authorised, not only to refusea French request for the issue of supplementary rations to theTroupes Speciales, but also to suspend the issue of any supplies ofany nature to French regular troops pending further instructions.At this point the Cabinet adjourned discussion of the matterwhile the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary interviewedthe French Ambassador in London, who had been summoned toreceive the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the situation.On resumption of the discussion, the Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that M. Massigli had stated that a telegram had nowbeen received from General Beynet pressing for reinforcements.It was most important that the matter should be removed as soonas possible from the military to the political plane, and he hopedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government would take the &quot;initiative in making proposals. The Prime Minister had informed M. Massigli that wewere issuing orders to General Paget and were communicating withthe United States asking for their support. The wise course forthe French would be to give instructions that their troops should cease fire, withdraw to their barracks and conform to the ordersthey might receive from the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East. Inthat event he trusted that we should be able to protect them againstthe mob&apos;s vengeance. Once firing had ceased and order had been restored, we should be glad to open discussions in London.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers reportof his conversations with the French Ambassador, and authorised the immediate despatch of the telegrams to president Truman and General Paget, in the terms whichhad been approved in discussion.India.constitutional position.(previous reference:CM. (45) 1stConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Report of the india Committee (W.P. (45) 274) on the constitutional position inIndia.The Prime Minister said that he had reflected on thediscussion in Cabinet that morning on the Indian constitutional problem, and bad reached the conclusion that further consideration should be given to these issues before the Report of the india committee was finally adopted as a basis for action. While hewas ready to give full weight to the importance of a non-partyapproach which would prevent the Indian problem from becomingan issue of political controversy at the General Election, he woulddeprecate any hasty decision in a matter of such grave constitu-tional importance. Would it not be wiser to inform the Viceroythat these issues must stand over until after the General Election,when they could be considered by a new Government and a new parliament ?The Secretary of State for India said that he was persuadedthat there was a sound case on the merits, apart from any electoralconsiderations, for going ahead on the basis of the India Com-mittee&apos;s proposals. &apos; He was gravely apprehensive of the effectthat would be produced in India were the Viceroy to return
empty-handed at a time when Indian nationalism was passing-through an acute phase, and when there was a strong sense offrustration among political.parties in India, as the result of their inability to reach agreement amongst themselves. There was alsothe danger that we might miss a unique opportunity. If theseproposals were accepted, we might hope, with good fortune, formany years of orderly progress in India. Even if the Indianswere so ill-advised as to reject them, we should, at any rate, have placed ourselves in an extremely strong position with publicopinion in this country and abroad. He strongly urged that,before deciding to defer this matter until after the Election, theCabinet should give the Viceroy an opportunity of putting his views before them.The Prime Minister said that he entirely agreed that theViceroy should have an opportunity of discussing these issues withthe Cabinet.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for India to arrange for lord Wavell to attend a meeting of the Cabinet on thefollowing day to put before them his views on the proposals made by the India Committee in W.P. (45) 274.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,BOth May, 1945.
