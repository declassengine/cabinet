no1. At their meeting on the 12th July the Cabinet had appointed a Committee consisting of the President of the Board of Trade and minister of Production, the Minister of Labour and NationalService, the Minister of Fuel and Power and a representative ofthe Minister of War Transport, to consider the issues raised in cp. (45) 60 and 66 and to submit recommendations on them.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade and Minister of Production(CP. (45) 85), to which was annexed a report prepared by officials ofthe Departments principally concerned.The President of the Board of Trade and Minister of Produc-tion said that the Committee appointed by the Cabinet endorsed thereport prepared by the officials and concurred in the recommenda-tions set out in paragraph 19 of Annex I of CP. (45) 85. these recommendations were: (i) that the United States should continue to supply about90,000 tons of bunker coal a month although the UnitedKingdom would no longer be able to send any large coal to Europe after August; and(ii) that every effort, should be made to obtain some supplies ofcoal from Poland and Silesia in order to relieve theWestern European situation and to provide bunker coal for ships using Scandinavian and Baltic ports.We should have to obtain the agreement of the Americans to thefirst proposal. On the second it would be necessary to make a joint anglo-American approach to the Russians and we should in his view have to be prepared if necessary to give the Russians some concession in return. It was proposed that both issues should beraised at &quot; Terminal &quot; and, if the Cabinet approved the proposals,it would be essential that the Minister of War Transport should beinformed at once in order that he might take the matter up at&quot;Terminal.&quot;The Minister of State said that he supported the proposals inparagraph 19 of Annex I to CP. (45) 85. He felt, however, that if in the event it proved impossible to obtain supplies from poland and Silesia and if the present forecast of production in western germany proved correct, the situation in Western Europe might become so desperate that the possibility of exporting coal from thiscountry to Western Europe would have to be considered.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the coal position inthis country was such that he could not possibly in any circum-stances contemplate any exports from this country to western europe, and there was general agreement as to this.The Cabinet  ,(1) Agreed that the Minister of War Transport should forth-with be asked to raise at &quot; Terminal&apos;&apos; the two proposals set out in paragraph 19 of Annex I to CP. (45) 85.(2) Took note that the President of the Board of Trade and minister of Production would inform the CombinedCoal Committee of the action proposed.(3) Agreed that, whatever the outcome of the negotiations at&quot; Terminal,&quot; there could be no question of any exportsof coal from this country to Western Europe afterAugust.       ^___2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum (CP. (45) 82)by the Minister of Education, Acting Chairman of the CabinetCommittee on the Reception and Accommodation of Refugees, onthe question of non-repatriable refugees. The full scope of theproblem could not be properly assessed for some time; and theCommittee felt strongly that for the present all refugees displacedas the result of war must be regarded as eventually repatriable,and that a final decision to regard them as non-repatriable could
IllCM. 16 (45).only ultimately be reached after a careful review of all the relevantcircumstances obtaining at the time. In the light of a review ofexisting methods of giving temporary relief, and of the respectivefunctions of U.N.R.R.A. and of the Inter-Governmental Committeeon Refugees, they were definitely of opinion that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom could not continue to contribute to the relief of refugees on the basis of equal division between theUnited States and United Kingdom Governments which at presentgoverned the finances of the Inter-Governmental Committee but which, of course, in no way reflected the financial capacity of the twocountries. In the case of U.N.R.R.A., on the other hand, expensesof operation were shared between a number of Governments in proportion to their financial capacity; and the Committee felt thatit should be clearly recognised in these circumstances that the task of giving relief to refugees was in general one for U.N.R.R.A. they recommended that the position should be dealt with by the applica-tion of the principles set out in the Appendix to CP. (45) 82, whichshould, in the first place, be communicated to the United StatesGovernment with a view to securing their support.The Minister of State said that he had nothing to add to the review of the position contained in CP. (45) 82. It was of greatimportance that U.N.R.R A. should carry its proper responsibilities in this matter, and that we should avoid acceptance of responsibilityby the Inter-Governmental Committee for non-repatriable refugees,save where they quite clearly did not come within U.N.R.R.A.&apos;smandate. It would not, of course, follow that because certain categories of refugee did not fall within the scope of U.N.R.R.A.,they, therefore, necessarily were the responsibility of the Inter-Governmental Committee. There was some reason to think that theUnited States Government would be not unwilling to accept theprinciples now under discussion.The following points were made in discussion : (a) While there was a hard core of refugees who were likelyto prove genuinely &quot;non-repatriable,&quot; it was essential that weshould not accept any general liability for absorbing permanentlythe refugees received in this country, many of them on transitvisas, in view of conditions in their native countries which no longerheld good. Apart from the cost of dispensing relief, the social andgeneral consequences of declaring such refugees non-repatriablewould be very serious.(b) There had been indications in Italy of a disposition on thepart of U.N.R.R. A. to take the line that they could not be responsiblefor supporting citizens of a state once that state was prepared toreceive them back. That was a principle which we could not accept and should continue to resist.(c) There was no question of forcing any refugees to returnimmediately to their parent countries. Acceptance of the present proposals, which would be followed up by a further indication of our attitude at the meeting of the Council of U.N.R.R.A. next month, would, however, it was hoped, result in bringing pressure to bear on U.N.R.R.A. to accept the liabilities which we regardedas properly theirs.After further discussion, the Cabinet (1) Approved the principles set out in the Annex to cp. (45) 82;(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs tocommunicate those principles to the United StatesGovernment and to endeavour to secure their acceptanceof them.Cabinet Offices, S.W. 1,20th July, 1945.
