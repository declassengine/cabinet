37CM. 6 (45)&quot;. *Parliament, 1.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord ChancellorKing&apos;8 Speech (CP. (45) 18) covering a draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the forth-on the coming prorogation of Parliament prepared by a MinisterialProrogation of Committee appointed by the Prime Minister on the 1st June.Parliament. The following points arose in discussion : Reference- (a)     was-suggested that, in substitution for the fourth andWM (44) 154th sixtn sentences of paragraph 1, the following passage should be conclusions     inserted after the third sentence : Minute l.) &quot; This deliverance is due not only to the resolution withwhich My people in these islands have carried on the struggle,but also to the stalwart aid so freely given by the peoples and governments of My Commonwealth and Empire overseas, tothe splendid armies, fleets and air forces of the United Statesand the vast supplies which they have afforded, and to theheroic deeds of the armies of much-suffering Russia. We mustexpress our deep admiration, of the exertions of all those other allies who fought by our side on sea, land and in the air, andof the resistance of their peoples, now happily restored to their former independence.&quot;(b) It was agreed that the words &apos;&apos; and with all others who have experienced the same calamity &quot; should be inserted at the end ofJ;he first sentence of paragraph 4, and that of the second sentence of the paragraph should read : &quot; The swift advance of the forces closing in on Japan&apos;andthe resounding victory in Burma have brought nearer their liberation.&quot;(e) It was noted that the,wording of paragraph 6 would haveto be reconsidered in the light of the final decision with regard tothe announcement which it was proposed that the Secretary of Statefor India should make in the following week.(d) It was agreed that the words &quot; the cost of the public services &quot; should be substituted for the words &quot; of every branch ofthe public service &apos;&apos; in paragraph 8.(e) It was a greed that the first sentence of paragraph 10 should read :-&quot; Steps&apos; have been taken, in close co-operation with theGovernments of the United States, Canada and otherDominions, to mitigate the grave shortages in world suppliesof many essential foods.&quot;(/) It was agreed that the first sentence of paragraph 13 shouldmake it clear that families of serving men would benefit from the family allowances scheme, and that the second sentence should be omitted. It was also agreed that the third sentence should besimplified.(g) It was agreed to simplify the wording of paragraph 16.The Cabinet-Approved the draft of The King&apos;s Speech appended to cp. (45) 18, subject to the points made in discussion, and authorised the Lord Chancellor to amend the draft on thelines suggested, referring where necessary to the PrimeMinister.Leader of the 2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he hadOpposition. written to Mr. Attlee on the 31st May saying that he hoped that the communication present agreement between parties on foreign and military policyof information would continue; and that if Mr. Attlee was willing to share in theon Affairs of Government&apos;s anxieties, though not in their responsibilities, facili-Strategy. ties would be offered to him to see papers on the main developments in foreign affairs and strategy.[30143-6.] b 2
Mr. Attlee had now replied that he saw great public advantage in preserving and presenting to the world the unity on foreign policywhich had been maintained for the last five years, and had acceptedthe offer made.      - -Some discussion ensued as to when this arrangement should bemade public^ The Prime: Minister thought that on balance it shouldnot be announced until after the election.The Prime Minister also informed the Cabinet that it looked as though the next Three Power meeting would be held at a datebetween polling day and the declaration of the results. In thesecircumstances he had invited Mr. Attlee to accompany him to theConference in order that, whatever the result of the election, thevoice of Britain might be united.   This offer had been accepted.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.India. 3.-   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theConstitutional Secretary of State for India. (CP. (45) 21) covering a telegramPosition. received from the Viceroy reporting the result of his consultation(Previous with his Council, on the proposals approved by the Cabinet on the reference:        31st May.CM. (45) 4th &apos; The main point of the telegram was that the Indian membersConclusions, present at the meetings of the Council on the 5th* and 6th June, had minute 2.) with one exception put in a statement of which the chief featurewas that in their view a declaration of &quot; complete dominion status &quot;should be made immediately, as no National Government could work under the present constitutional limitations; that India was notinterested in interim arrangements, but in a final -settlement; andthat without such a declaration the proposals had no chance ofsuccess.The Lord Chancellor reported that the India Committee, whohad considered the telegram that morning, were disturbed that theViceroy should take the view that the proposals still had a chanceof. acceptance, notwithstanding the .very unfavourable receptionwhich they had had from the Indian members*of the Council. the india Committee thought that it was now certain that the proposals would be rejected. Moreover, it now looked as though the offermight well result in an agitation for complete dominion status onthe part of representatives of all the main political parties in India.Nevertheless, the India Committee had felt that, matters havinggone so far, it was impossible not to proceed with the Viceroy&apos;sproposals. Their substance had already become known in India.Furthermore, a decision not to proceed with the proposals on thegrounds that the members of the Viceroy&apos;s Council were opposedto them, would put the members of the Council, who had servedus well, in a false position.The point was also made that if, as it seemed almost certain,the offer was rejected, the Viceroy might have great difficulty inretaining an effective. Council. It was clear that many of theexisting members were greatly disturbed byv what had taken place,and that there would probably be several resignations.After discussion the Cabinet agreed as follows:  (1) The India Committee were invited to meet that afternoon and draft a reply to the Viceroy, for submission to thePrime Minister. This reply would include the followingpoints: (a) In the Cabinet&apos;s view there was virtually no likelihood-hood that the Viceroy&apos;s proposals would now beaccepted and the Cabinet were both puzzled anddisturbed by the fact that the Viceroy should statethat he. thought the proposals had a reasonable chance of acceptance, notwithstanding the line taken by the India members of his Council.
channel islands.(previous reference:W.M.(45)87thConclusions,Minute 1.)(6) Nevertheless, matters had now gone so far, and information about the proposals had become known to such an extent, that the Cabinet agreedthat the Viceroy should proceed to make his offer.(c) In the situation which had arisen, and in view of the likelihood that a demand would be raised for animmediate declaration Of &quot; complete dominion status,&quot; it was all the more necessary that theViceroy should adhere rigidly to the terms of his proposals as approved by the Cabinet and shouldnot make any advance whatever therefrom or bedrawn into any form of negotiation.(d) When the Viceroy had made his offer he should report to London how it was received before any further action was taken.&quot; (2) As it was now virtually certain that the Viceroy&apos;s proposals, would be rejected, the Secretary of. State should amendany passages in his draft statement to Parliament whichmight imply that we thought the proposals had a good chance of success. The amended draft should be sub-mitted to the Prime Minister.(3) Communications should be sent to Dominion PrimeMinisters and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atWashington, timed to reach them a few hours before theViceroy&apos;s statement, informing them of the Viceroy&apos;sproposals.4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (45) 15) about the repatriation of civilians evacuated from the Channel Islands.The Home Secretary said that when the Channel Islands wereliberated a pledge had been given that persons evacuated from the islands in 1940 would be given an opportunity to return. TheCommander of the military forces in the Islands considered that itwas important that an announcement about the plans for their return should be made in the near future, and the Islands&apos;authorities had agreed that it would be possible to absorb in thenear future about 600 additional persons per week and were pre-pared to undertake the responsibility of allotting priorities. TheMinistry of War Transport had earmarked a passenger boat forthe Channel Islands service, but it would probably not be availablefor service for eight weeks. It was, in his view, essential that somearrangements should be made immediately to start the flow of returning residents, and he suggested that Transport Commandshould be asked to provide sufficient aircraft to transport some600 persons a week to the Islands.In discussion it was pointed out that the use of transport command aircraft would reduce the extent to which they wereavailable for the Armed Forces leave scheme and the general viewof the Cabinet was that it would be preferable to rely on sea transport.The Minister of War Transport said that by withdrawing a passanger boat from the Dieppe Service he could enable the repat-riation of Channel Islanders to begin within a fortnight, and TheFirst Lord of the Admiralty promised to consider the possibility of supplementing this by the use of naval vessels until the passengerboat which had been earmarked became available.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal that the repatriation of civiliansevacuated from the Channel Islands should begin as soonas possible, and&quot; invited the Home Secretary to consult withthe First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of war transport with regard to the provision of sea transport for this purposet

(45) 14) proposingPlanning, that a general indication should be given of the GovernmentsControl of      attitude to the problem of land use.^Previous ^^ster 0f Town and Country Planning said that a state-Reference- ment on the lines suggested was most desirable in order toWM (44)78th encourage planning authorities to proceed with their proposals. he conclusions ; would be content if the Election Manifesto included the followingMinutes.)&apos;    sentence.-&quot; We shall bring forward in the new Parliament proposalsfor improving the law with regard to compensation and betterment, so as to secure for the future the best use of land in thepublic interest, including proper reservation of open spaces andthe best location of industry and housing.&quot;The Cabinet-Agreed that the sentence suggested by the Minister of town and Country Planning should be included in theElection Manifesto.Civil Aviation. 6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the(Previous Minister of Civil Aviation (CP. (45) 19) to which was annexedReference: (Appendix III) a draft telegram to the State Department settingW.M.(44) 161st out the lines on which His Majesty&apos;s Government were ready to conclusions, enter into civil aviation agreements with foreign Governments and minute 7.) their policy with regard to airfields required for international air services.The draft telegram had been prepared as a reply to two telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington(Appendices I and II to CP. (45) 19) dealing with (i) a request from the State Department for assurances that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would not oppose the efforts of the United StatesGovernment to acquire landing rights in the Near and middle east for United States commercial air services, and (ii) certainallegations by Mr. Clayton of the State Department to the effectthat the opposition which the United States Authorities wereencountering in their efforts to negotiate air transport routes in theNear and Middle East countries had been stimulated by the advicegiven to those countries by His Majesty&apos;s Mission.The Prime Minister said that, if it were possible, he would prefer to postpone any reply until he had an opportunity of raising the matter orally with the President of the United States, and thathe would be glad if this possibility could be considered by the CivilAviation Committee.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume consideration of&quot; CP. (45) 19 at their meeting on the 11th June, and invited the Civil aviation committee to consider, in the meantime, the suggestion made by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,8th June, 1945.   -
