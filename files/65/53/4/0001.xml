Syria andthe Lebanon.(previous reference:CM. (45)3rdConclusions,Minute 2.)India.constitutional position.(previous reference:CM. (45) 3rdConclusions,Minute 1.)1.   The   Prime   Minister   informed   the   Cabinet   that   a reply had now been received from President Truman indicating that jhe approved of the message to General de Gaulle which had beenembodied in the Prime Ministers telegram No. 59 of the 30th May.2. At their meeting on the 31st May the Cabinet had invited the India Committee to review, in the light of the explanationsgiven by the Viceroy, the terms of the draft statement annexed toW.P. (45) 274. They now had before them a further report(CP. (45) 5), by the India Committee setting out the amendments which they proposed should be made in the draft statement.After discussion, the Cabinet Approved the drafting amendments proposed by the india committee in CP. (45) 5, subject to the addition at theend of new draft, paragraph 12a, of the words &quot; and hisfreedom of choice therefore remains unrestricted.&quot;The Prime Minister said that he was concerned aboutparagraphs 14 and 15 of the draft statement. Paragraph 15, inparticular, might be understood by Parliament as implying thattheir powers were being limited without legislation. The powersand privileges of Parliament must be carefully safeguarded, andthere could be no question of their powers being taken away byde facto action. Moreover, the Viceroy&apos;s position in negotiationwould be further strengthened if he was in a position to say thathe was not empowered to do anything which might limit the powersof Parliament.In discussion, it was explained that these paragraphs had been inserted in the draft statement with a view to drawing the attentionof Parliament to the risk that, if persons were appointed to theViceroy&apos;s Executive Council on a representative basis, their presencemust, as time went on, react on the powers of the Viceroy for, tothe extent that they were representative, it would be more difficultto over-ride their advice. It was suggested, on the other hand, that nothing short of legislation could formally limit the powers and responsibilities of the House of Commons, whatever conventionsmight develop in practice. Lord Wavell said that he would much prefer to see these two paragraphs omitted from the state-ment. He was reluctant to see anything included which would suggest that his powers were undergoing any change, since thiswould make the task of handling his Council still more difficult.After discussion, the Cabinet Agreed that paragraphs 14 and 15 of the draft statementappended to W.P. (45) 274 should be omitted.At the suggestion of the Secretary of State for India, theCabinet Approved the following supplementary amendments to thedraft statement (i) in the second line of paragraph 9 after theword &apos;&apos; period &apos;&apos; the words &apos;&apos; under the existing constitution &apos;&apos;should be inserted; and (ii) in the second line of paragraph 11,&quot; composition &quot; should be substituted for &quot; constitution.&quot;At the invitation of the Prime Minister the Viceroy read tothe Cabinet the draft of the broadcast which he proposed to makesimultaneously with the statement to be made in the House ofCommons by the Secretary of State for India. A number of drafting amendments were suggested, and were accepted by the Viceroy.In addition, the following points arose in discussion of thedraft broadcast (a) The broadcast as drafted stated that responsibility forchoosing India&apos;s delegates to international conferences would in
21CM. i (45).future rest with the new Council, if and when formed. It wassuggested that it would be desirable to avoid any commitment onthis point and to leave the Viceroy&apos;s freedom of choice entirelyunfettered. The Viceroy agreed, and undertook to amend hisbroadcast accordingly.(b) The Viceroy said that he would like to discuss with his present Council the tactics to be adopted as regards the release ofmembers of the Congress Working Committee who were still under detention at the opening of the conference which he had in view.It was the view of the Cabinet that the Viceroy should have discre-tion, subject to the views of his Council, to release members of theWorking Committee still in detention on that date, but that theremaining detainees should not be released until the new Govern-ments at the Centre and in the Provinces were in power and had agreed to their release.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were greatly indebted to the Viceroy for his assistance and for the full explanation which he bad given of theprocedure which he proposed to adopt in dealing with this matter.They entirely agreed with thai procedure. He thanked the Viceroywarmly on behalf of the Cabinet and expressed their cordial good wishes for the success of the discussions that lay before him.The Viceroy thanked the Cabinet for their considerationof his views and for their good wishes.The Cabinet endorsed the conclusions reached at this meeting and at their earlier discussions on the 30th and 31st May on theconstitutional problem in India, as follows :  (1) The Viceroy should, immediately on his return to India,invite his Executive Council to express their views on theproposals set out in the draft statement annexed to this minute and should communicate their views to HisMajesty&apos;s Government.(2) Subject to the views of the Council, when received and considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Secretaryof State for India should make a statement in the Houseof Commons in the terms of the draft annexed to this minute.(3) The Viceroy should simultaneously announce his proposals in India, in a broadcast in the terms approved by theCabinet.(4) Proposals for the further Indianisation of the indian army would require further discussion by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and no public reference should be made tothese proposals at this stage.(5) A United Kingdom High Commissioner should beappointed in India to represent the particular interestsof the United Kingdom, and an announcement to this effect should be made by the Secretary of State for indian connection with his proposed statement in the Houseof Commons.(6) The Viceroy would discuss with his Executive Council onhis return to India the release of the eight members ofthe Congress Working Committee who were still in detention; and, subject to their views, would agree tothe. release of those persons on the opening of thediscussions on the constitutional offer. The balance ofthe detainees would not, however, be released unless anduntil the offer which was now to be put forward hadbeen accepted by the Indian political parties and theCentral and Provincial authorities responsible for theircustody were agreeable to their release.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,31st May, 1945.[30143-4]
APPENDIX,Revised Dra\ft of Statement to be made in Parliament by the Secretary of^tatefor India.I. During the recent visit of Field-Marshal Viscount Wavell to this countryHis Majesty&apos;s Government reviewed with him a number of problems and discussed particularly the present political situation in India.   -2. Members will be aware that since the offer by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto India in March 1942 there has been no further progress towards the solution ofthe Indian constitutional problem.3. As was then stated, the working out of India&apos;s new constitutional system is a task which can only be carried through by the Indian peoples themselves.4. While His Majesty&apos;s Government are at all times most anxious to do their utmost to assist the Indians in the working out of a new constitutional settlement, it would be a contradiction in terms to speak of the impositionby this country of self-governing institutions upon an unwilling India. Sucha thing is not possible, nor could we accept the responsibility for enforcingsuch institutions at the very time when we were, by its purpose, withdrawing from all control of British Indian affairs.5. The main constitutional position remains therefore as it was. Theoffer of March 1942 stands in its entirety without change or qualification. HisMajesty&apos;s Government still hope that the political leaders in India may be ableto come to an agreement as to the procedure whereby India&apos;s permanent futureform of government can be determined.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government are, however, most anxious to make any contribution that is practicable to the breaking of the political deadlock in India.While that deadlock lasts not only political but social and economic progress isbeing hampered.7. The Indian administration, over-burdened with the great tasks laid upon it by the war against Japan and by the planning for the post-war period, isfurther strained by the political tension that exists.8. All that is so urgently required to be done for agricultural and industrialdevelopment and for the peasants and workers of India cannot be carried throughunless the whole-hearted co-operation of every community and section of the indian people is forthcoming.9. His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore considered whether there is something which they could suggest in this interim period; under the existing constitution, pending the formulation by Indians of their future constitutional arrangements, which would enable the main communities and parties to co-operatemore closely together and with the British to the benefit of the people of India asa whole.10. It is not the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to introduce anychange contrary to the wishes of the major Indian communities. But they are willing to make possible some step forward during the interim period if theleaders of the principal Indian parties are prepared to agree to their suggestions and to co-operate in the successful conclusion of the war against Japan as well asin the reconstruction in India which must follow the final victory.II. To this end they would be prepared to see an important change in the composition of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive. This is possible without making anychange in the existing statute law except for one amendment to the NinthSchedule to the Act of 1935. That Schedule contains a provision that not lessthan three members of the Executive must have had at least ten years&apos; service under the Crown in India. If the proposals I am about to lay before the Housemeet with acceptance in India, that clause would have to be amended to dispense with that requirement.12. It is proposed that the Executive Council should be reconstituted andthat the Viceroy should in future make his selection for nomination to theCrown for appointment to his Executive from amongst leaders of indian political life at the Centre and in the Provinces, in proportions which wouldgive a balanced representation of the main communities/including equalproportions of Moslems and Caste Hindus.
23 CM. 4 (45).13.. In order to pursue this object, the Viceroy will call into conference anumber of leading Indian politicians who are the heads of the most importantparties or who have had recent experience as Prime Ministers of Provinces,together with a few others of special experience and authority. The Viceroyintends to put before this conference the proposal that the Executive council should be reconstituted as above stated and to invite from the members of theconference a list of names. Out of these he would hope to be able to choose the future members whom he would recommend for appointment by His majesty o the Viceroy&apos;s Council, although the responsibility for the recommendationsmust, of course, continue to rest with him, and his freedom of choice thereforeremains unrestricted.14. The members of his Council who are chosen as a result of thisarrangement would, of course, accept the position on the basis that they wouldwhole-heartedly co-operate in supporting and carrying through the war against japan to its victorious conclusion.15. The members of the Executive would be Indians with the exceptionof the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief, who would retain his position as war Member. This is essential so long as the defence of India remains aBritish responsibility.16. Nothing contained in any of these proposals will affect the relations of the Crown with the Indian States through the Viceroy as Crown Represen-tative.17. The Viceroy has been authorised by His Majesty&apos;s Government toplace this proposal before the Indian leaders immediately upon his return toIndia. His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that the leaders of the Indiancommunities will respond. For the success of such a plan must depend upon its acceptance in India and the degree to which responsible Indian politiciansare prepared to co-operate with the object of making it a workable interim arrangement. In the absence of such general acceptance existing arrangements must necessarily continue.18. If such co-operation can be achieved at the Centre it will no doubt be reflected in the Provinces and so enable responsible Governments to be set uponce again in those Provinces where, owing to the withdrawal of the majorityparty from participation, it became necessary to put into force the powers ofthe Governors under Section 93 of the Act of 1935. It is to be hoped that inall the Provinces these Governments would be based on the participation, ofthe main parties, thus smoothing out communal differences and allowingMinisters to concentrate upon their very heavy administrative tasks.19. There is one further change which, if these proposals are accepted,His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest should follow.20. That is, that External Affairs (other than those tribal and frontiermatters which fall to be dealt with as part of. the defence of India) should beplaced in the charge of an Indian -Member of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive so faras British India is concerned, and that fully accredited representatives shall beappointed for the representation of India abroad.&apos;21. By their acceptance of and co-operation in this scheme the indian leaders will not only be able to make their immediate contribution to the directionof Indian affairs, but it is also to be hoped that their experience of cO-operation in government will expedite agreement between them as to the method of working out the new constitutional arrangements.22. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider, after the most careful study ofthe question, that the plan now suggested gives the utmost progress practicablewithin the present Constitution. None of the changes suggested will in anyway prejudice or prejudge the essential form of the future permanentConstitution or Constitutions for India.23 His Majesty&apos;s Government feel certain that given goodwill and a genuine desire to co-operate on all sides, both British and Indian, these proposalscan mark a genuine step forward in the collaboration of the British and Indianpeoples towards Indian self-government and can assert the rightful position,and strengthen the influence, of India in the counsels of the nations.
