Three-Power 1.   The Cabinet discussed arrangements in connection with theMeeting.        forthcoming, meeting  between  the  Prime Minister,  president truman and Marshal Stalin.The discussion is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard Pile of: Cabinet Conclusions.GeneralElection.Position ofLordsLieutenant.2. The Prime Minister said that it was undesirable that aLord Lieutenant, who was The King&apos;s representative, should take an active part in politics during the General Election within thecounty in which he held office. He therefore proposed to askSir Archibald Sinclair, who was both Lord Lieutenant and Memberof Parliament for Caithness, to resign the office of Lord Lieutenanton the understanding that he would be reappointed after theElection.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that if Sir archibald sinclair were ready to fall in with this suggestion, no difficulty would arise in other parts of Scotland. He himself was proposing to make a number of political speeches in various parts of Scotland,but would not speak anywhere in the county (Midlothian) for whichhe was Lord Lieutenant.The Cabinet took note that the Prime Minister would approachSir Archibald Sinclair on the lines which he had indicated.Food.Meat supplies for the &quot;UnitedKingdom andLiberatedEurope.(previous reference:W.M.(45)61stConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade and Minister of Production and the Ministerof State (CP. (45) 28) and by the Minister of Food (CP. (45) 29)on the supply of meat to Allied countries in North-West Europe.The President of the Board of Trade and Minister ofProduction said that the meat situation in Allied countries in north-West Europe was serious. No meat would be allocated toFrance, Belgium and Holland through the Combined Food board or S.H.A.E.F. during the second and third quarters of 1945, andthe outlook for the fourth quarter was uncertain. Domestic produc-tion in those countries was so low that it was not practicable to distribute even a small ration without some supplies from overseas.It was important that the Governments of these countries shouldcontinue to co-operate in the Combined Supply machinery; but theywere complaining that they could not satisfy public opinion in their countries if no supplies of meat were made available to them, andthere was a serious risk that France and Belgium, who had thenecessary hard, currency, would be driven to enter the Argentinemarket on their own account, and so reduce our chance of obtainingfrom that country the supplies of carcase meat which we so badlyrequired. He therefore suggested that we should make available atonce from United Kingdom resources some contribution towardsthe meat requirements of the European Allies, provided that this could be done without further reductions in the United Kingdommeat ration. This would enable us to put strong pressure on theUnited States and Canadian Governments to take similar action.The Minister of Food said that the utmost contribution whichthe United Kingdom could make out of supplies under his control would be 25,000 tons of canned meat which were now in a specialreserve. If this reserve were disposed of, there was no prospect ofany but negligible quantities of canned meat being distributed on points during the first half of 1946, and the monthly number of-points would have to be further reduced from 20 to 16. He was unwilling to impose this further sacrifice on the people of thiscountry; but if Service requirements were reduced and if we could get more meat than previously expected from the Dominions or[30420-2] B 2
from the Argentine, he would be willing to defer improvements inour civilian diet in order to make this surplus available for the liberated areas. He felt that the Governments of France, belgium and Holland should be strongly pressed to refrain from competing with us in the Argentine market, and that both we and the UnitedStates Government should join in pressing the Argentine Govern-ment, not only to agree to deal with the United Kingdom alone, butalso to increase the amount of meat made available for export. Atthe end of 1944, when under strong pressure from the United Stateswe had been prevented from making a long-term meat contract with the Argentine, we had been promised full diplomatic support from the United States, and the United States Government should now be called on to give us this support.The Secretary of State for War said that 15,000 tons of meat and vegetable rations, which had been set aside for the Army forfeeding Russian nationals, had not been required and could nowbe made available. There was, however, no prospect of additional supplies of meat becoming available during the next two months from reductions in British scales of military rations.The Prime Minister said that there could be no question of finding additional meat supplies for Allied countries in Europe by reducing the meat ration of civilians in the United Kingdom. Hewould, however, be willing to send a telegram to the President ofthe United States in which he would recall the assistance which wehad given to the United States Government by deferring the conclu-sion of a long-term meat contract with the Argentine, would pointout the difficulties with which we were now faced in securing a contract owing to the fact that the shortages in France and Belgiummight drive the Governments of these countries to enter theArgentine market in competition with us, and would invite thePresident to agree that if we contributed 15,000 tons of meat and vegetable rations towards meeting the shortages in North-west europe during the coming three to four months the United StatesGovernment would make a proportionate contribution. ThePresident should be reminded of the promise, which he had madeto the Minister of Production in April, to consider whether the foodreserves held by the United States Forces against the risks ofsinkings and wastage could be made available for other uses whenit became unnecessary, after the end of the war in Europe, to holdreserves against those risks.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Prime Minister should send a telegram on these lines to the President of the United States and invited the President of the Board of Trade and Ministerof Production and the Minister of Food to submit a draft frr consideration by the Prime Minister.Food. 4.   In connection with the discussion recorded in the precedingLabour for the Minute, The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that he was1945 Harvest,  concerned about the supply of labour for the harvest this year.   Thepublic did not seem to realise the seriousness of the food situationand the response to the appeal which had been made for volunteers for work during the harvest was most disappointing.F^nr. The Cabinet-if&apos;&quot; &apos; Invited the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theI      &quot; Secretary of State for Scotland to consult with the Minister1   &apos; - of Information with a view to bringing home to the public the importance of an adequate supply of volunteers forwork during the 1945 harvest.
55G.M. 8 (45)..5. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Ministerof State (CP. (45) 36) covering the draft of a Memorandum for theEuropean Advisory Commission proposing initial measures for thedestruction of Germany&apos;s war potential.In discussion it was pointed out that it was desirable that the solicitor-General should be aware, for his guidance in the discus-sions on reparations problems at the Moscow Conference, of the broad lines of policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government would wishto apply in respect of the industrial disarmament of Germany. Itwas also important that some preliminary guidance should be givento Field-Marshal Montgomery regarding the types of industrial capacity which should be destroyed in the British zone of occupation in Germany.The Prime Minister said that it would be impossible for theCabinet at the present time to give detailed consideration, as recom-mended in paragraph 5 (a) of CP. (45) 36, to the complex recom-mendations which had been put forward on this subject by theArmistice and Post-War Committee on the basis of A.P.W. (45) 57.All that was necessary at present, however, was that the Solicitor-General should be able to take the Memorandum annexed to CP.(45) 36 as general background for his guidance in discussions atthe Moscow Conference; and that the Memorandum should also beused as a basis for instructions to Field-Marshal Montgomeryregarding the initial measures to be taken within the British zone of occupation for the destruction of Germany&apos;s war potential.The Cabinet were informed that the First Lord of the Admiraltydesired that the last sentence of paragraph 5 (b) of the Annex to cp. (45) 36 should be amended so as to read : &quot; Eeduction of theship-repairing industry, as soon as circumstances permit, until itdoes not exceed the size necessary to meet the minimum requirementsof ships trading to German ports.&quot; This proposal, which was supported by the Minister of War Transport, was endorsed by theCabinet.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Memorandum reproduced in the Annex to cp. (45) 36, subject to the amendment of paragraph 5(&amp;) noted above, might be communicated to the Solicitor-General for his guidance in the forthcoming discussions at the Reparations Conference in Moscow, and might also be used as a basis for instructions to Field-MarshalMontgomery regarding the initial measures to be takenin the British zone of occupation for the destruction ofGermany&apos;s war potential.(2) Decided that the Memorandum should not be communicatedto the European Advisory Commission, at any rate untilthe views of the British element of the Allied control commission for Germany had been ascertained and con-sidered by the Cabinet.   JN(3) Deferred consideration of the more detailed recommenda-tions made by the Armistice and Post-War Committeeon the basis of A.P.W. (45) 57.6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade and Minister of Production (CP.(45) 35) covering a report on the coal situation in North-west europe.The President of the Board of Trade and Minister ofProduction pointed out that coal production in Western Germany,on which the whole of the industry of North-West Europe depended,was at present only about 3 per cent, of normal, and that lack ofcoalswas the limiting factor to further progress in the rehabilitation of Western Europe and Italy. It was essential that immediate and drastic steps should be taken on the lines recommended in the
report of the Potter-Hyndley Mission. He laid special stress onthe recommendation that a strong Solid Fuel Committee should beset up at Allied Control Headquarters to co-ordinate the coal and mining supply requirements and the general policies pertaining tosolid fuels within the different zones. It was important that thiscommittee should form part of the military organisation and should cover at least the whole of the three Western zones so that theycould be dealt with as one unit.In discussion, The Minister of Fuel and Power said that wehad no commitments to supply coal from this country to theContinent beyond the end of August. It was the view of the Cabinetthat we should undertake no fresh commitment to supply to theContinent any coal which we could use in this country.The Cabinet-Gave general approval to the recommendations in thereport annexed to CP. (45) 35 and, in particular, agreedthat a Solid Fuel Committee on the lines suggested inparagraph 5 of CP. (45) 35 should be set up at allied control Headquarters.Post-War 7.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the HomeFire Services.  Secretary (CP. (45) 34) on the future of the fire fighting services.(Previous Home Secretary explained that the War Cabinet had reference:      authorised his predecessor to discuss this question with theW.M. (44)I3lst associations of local authorities.  These discussions had shown that conclusions,    a large majority of local authorities desired that the GovernmentMmute l.)      should honour the pledge that after the war the fire-fightingservices would again become a local authority responsibility.   Inhis own view it was right that these services should be under localauthority control, although it was desirable that the lessons learnedduring the war should be taken into account and that there shouldbe a reduction in the number of units and an improvement inco-operative organisation.This question was likely to be raised in the Election and, ifthe Cabinet approved, he proposed to announce that the Govern-ment believed in principle that the fire-fighting services should again become a local authority responsibility. The future organisation would then be discussed further with representativesof local authorities.The Secretary of State for Scotland supported this proposal.- The Secretary of State for Air said that it was most important that, if the fire-fighting services were returned to local authoritycontrol, they should be so organised as to ensure that an effectivefire-fighting force was ready for immediate mobilisation in the eventof war. ...The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that in peace-time the responsibilityfor the fire-fighting services should rest with the localauthorities.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland to consult with the Prime Minister on the terms in which, and the time at which, this decision should be announced.(3) Took note that in their detailed consideration of the post-war organisation of the fire-fighting services the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland would consult with the Secretary of State for Air on the meansof ensuring that the services could become effective on awar-time basis immediately on the outbreak of war.
Constitutionalpolicy in malaya.(previous reference:W.M.(45) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (W.P. (45) 287) on future constitutionalpolicy in Malaya.The Secretary of State for the Colonies recalled that at their meeting on the 9th January the Cabinet had postponed a decisionon the proposal made in W.P. (44) 762 for making known to alimited circle our political plans for Malaya on the ground thatthis proposal, while not offering the advantage which would result from publicity for a settled policy, might lead to leakages whichwould be embarrassing. Although he felt that we should not forthe time being consider any greater measure of publicity than had previously been proposed, he was impressed with the desirabilityof influencing general opinion both in this country and in the Eastamongst circles whose goodwill and understanding were important to us and of providing material for a scheme of political warfare.Admiral Mountbatten had pressed for an early disclosure of HisMajesty&apos;s Governments policy for the future of Malaya and theChiefs of Staff felt that there would be some military advantage if the proposals in W.P. (45) 287 were approved by the Cabinet.He accordingly proposed that a statement of the fundamentalproblems in Malaya in the terms annexed to W.P. (45) 287 shouldbe distributed to the official agencies enumerated in paragraph 4of that Memorandum, in order that these agencies might be able to guide unofficial thought on the problems involved and direct public attention and discussion towards a political and social developmentof Malaya along the lines which the provisional policy envisaged.There was no question of any public announcement.The Cabinet-Agreed that the statement annexed to W.P. (45) 287should be distributed to the official agencies enumerated in paragraph 4 of W.P. (45) 287.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,IMh June, 1945.
