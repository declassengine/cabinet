In Europe air operations had been confined to transport; and(Previous       during the period 50,000 released prisoners of war and 24,000Reference:      casualties had been flown to this country.W.M:(45)61stConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations. In South-East Asia operations had been curtailed by theSouth-East : monsoon, but some strategic attacks had been made on JapaneseAsia. communications in Siam and South-East Burma.   Air transport had carried 27,000 men and 32,000 tons of supplies.Chiria. United States Air Forces had flown 4,500 sorties in support ofthe Chinese Armies.Pacific. In the Pacific, apart from operations by Super-Fortresses,18,000 sorties had been flown, including 3,200 by the Australian andNew Zealand Air Forces. Attacks had been made on airfields and harbours in Formosa and on railways in French Indo-China.Super-Fortresses had flown 3,750 sorties, for the loss of80 aircraft, and had dropped 21,000 tons of bombs on Tokyo, Nagoya. and Osaka.   It was estimated that 46 per cent, of Tokyo had been severely damaged.Coastal The Prime Minister asked the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff to command.      furnish him with a report on the reduction of Coastal command and the transfer of its resources, in men and aircraft, to other purposes.naval ,        Since the German surrender two ships totalling 3,182 tons had operations. been mined and sunk in the Mediterranean. Losses due to enemy shipping Losses, action in May had been 6 ships, totalling 22,386 tons.102 U-boats were now in British ports. 42 were still afloat in norwegian, Danish and German ports. One had scuttled herselfoff the Portuguese coast on the 2nd June. Although not more than5 U-boats were believed to be still at sea, about 100 were stillunaccounted for; and it was thought that these had probably beenscuttled.Home waters The German cruisers Prince Eugen and Nurnberg had been and North      transferred from Copenhagen to Wilhelmshaven.  No ocean convoysAtlantic.        had been sailed in the non-combat areas since the 29th May.Pacific. The British Pacific Fleet had withdrawn from the operationalarea to replenish in Australia. Their task of neutralising airfields in the Sakishima Group had been taken over by American escortoarriers.Military Owing to the onset of the monsoon and the pause followingOperations. the fall of Rangoon, operations in Burma were restricted to burma. mopping up.   Japanese forces between the Irrawaddy and theSittang River were being steadily liquidated.China. The Japanese were withdrawing some of their forces in southern China, to an extent which was likely to jeopardise their communications to the South.Okinawa. Tn southern Okinawa the stiff opposition which had been maintained by the Japanese was being overcome, and United states forces were now making steady progress. It seemed likely that theremainder of the island would now be cleared fairly rapidly.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.[30143-5]
i&apos;l   &apos;    !M:0m 28 - m$2. The Cabinet were informed that the French cruiser /eanneoVArc had sailed from Oran and might be carrying reinforcements toSyria.. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris had been given to under-stand that the ship had been ordered not to proceed to Beirut; and information had been received in the Admiralty that she had put inat Bizerta. It was possible, however, that she might attempt togo to Beirut, where her arrival was likely to provoke furtherdisturbances. .The Prime Minister said that he had instructed the Chiefs ofStaff to take all necessary steps to ensure that this ship did not landreinforcements at Beirut, using whatever methods they thought best calculated to secure this object with the least risk of bloodshed.3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theR.A.F. Base in Secretary of State for Air and the Secretary of State for IndiaMasirah (CP. (45) 3) recommending that negotiations be opened with the island. . Sultan of Muscat for a 99 years&apos; lease of Masirah Island.      .It was explained in the Memorandum that the island had been used by the R.A.F. throughout the war as one of their main bases in the Arabian Sea area, under a war-time agreement with the sultan. The Air Ministry thought it highly important for ourpost-war defensive strategy that our rights to the use of air facilities in the island, which we had constructed at considerable cost, shouldbe established on a permanent basis. It was desirable that negotia-tions for a permanent lease should be opened without delay so that agreement with the. Sultan might be reached before the war-timeagreement lapsed.In discussion the following points were made :-(a) The. Prime Minister said that there were very great advantages in maintaining the principle that we claimed no terri-torial advantages as a result of the war. Was it worth while to prejudice this claim for the sake of this air base in Masirah?It was suggested that this larger claim would not be prejudiced by our having obtained a base, by a freely negotiated lease withouttransfer of sovereignty; and that the lease suggested would becomparable with those which we had granted to the United states for bases in British territories.(b) Would it not be preferable, before proceeding with thisproposal, to ascertain the views of the United States Government ?They had, with our acquiescence, negotiated for the lease of an airfield in Saudi Arabia; and it seemed likely that on this accountthey would find difficulty in raising any objection to our negotiatingfor a similar lease in Masirah.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the United StatesGovernment had also incurred substantial expenditure on airinstallations in Masirah and, might wish to secure there post-warfacilities for civil aviation. While, therefore, it might be desirablepolitically to ascertain that they would not regard the present proposal as inconsistent with our claim that we desired no territorial advantages from the war, prior consultation on the lines suggested might lead them to take steps to consolidate their own position in the Island.    -(c) In view of our present difficulties in the Levant States, thiswas not an appropriate moment to take a step which might lead tofurther complications with the French, on account of their long-standing, though no longer important, position in Muscat.After further discussion the Prime Minister said that there might be an opportunity-to ascertain, at the forthcoming Three-Power meeting, whether there was likely to be general agreement that such leasing of bases was to be treated as on a different footing. . from the acquisition of territory; and he would prefer that adecision on this proposal should stand over until after that meeting.Syria andthe Lebanon.(previous reference:CM.

29CM. S (45).*The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Air and the Secretaryof State for India to submit this question for further discussion by the Cabinet in two months&apos; time.Shipping.AdmiraltyRequirementsfor the Fleet&apos;Train.in the pacific.(previous reference:W.M.(45)llthConclusions.)4. At their meeting on the 26th January, 1945, the WarCabinet had deferred for two months consideration of a request bythe Admiralty for eighteen large ships and thirteen smaller ships for the Fleet Train. The Cabinet now had before them a Memo-randum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (45) 323)reviewing the development of the situation since January 1945, and asking *(i) for the provision for the Fleet Train of twenty large ships(7,000   g.r.t.   each)   and   twenty-five   smaller   ships(3,000 g.r.t. each);(ii) for two crane ships in the event of its being impossible tofind floating crane&quot;s.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that in the view of theAdmiralty it was esssential to the successful conduct of naval opera-tions in the Pacific that the addition now proposed should be madeto the Fleet Train. The number of ships for which the Admiraltyasked was far below that recommended by Admiral Fraser. If weWere going to maintain a Fleet in the Pacific, it must be properlysupplied and provisioned, and the most economical method ofsecuring this was to provide an adequate Fleet Train. otherwise the Fleet would be forced, as now, to withdraw 4,000 miles toSydney to replenish.The Minister of War Transportsaid that/after this provisionhad been made for the Fleet Train, he wOuld be faced with a deficiency for the remaining months of this year of eighty-fiveshippings per month. The United Kingdom import programme forthe second half of the year had been reduced to 16-4 million tons,and, if there were any easing in the supply position, it would beimpossible to find additional shipping to increase the import. Ofthe 230,000 tons of shipping that had already been advanced to theAdmiralty for the Fleet Train on the understanding of replacement,only 40,000 tons had been effectively returned.Further points in discussion were &apos;(a) The Prime Minister pointed out there had been in thelast twelve months a very substantial increase in the allocation ofshipping to the Fleet Train. Before April 1944 the allocation hadbeen 450,000 dead-weight tons. In April 1945 there had been an addition of 230,000 tons on the understanding that this would bereplaced ton for ton as received by the Minister of War Transport.In addition, the Minister of War Transport had made available afurther 150,000 tons. The present demand was for an extra 265,000tons, which would bring the total to 1,100,000 tons. Important asoperational requirements were, full consideration must be given tothe United Kingdom import programme and the demands of thecivil population in this country. The Admiralty might have toaccept some restriction in their operations as planned.(&amp;) Special types of ship were required for the Fleet Train :most of the requirement could be met only by new oil-burning ships.Our construction programme in Canada was almost exhausted, andit would be very hard to find the type of ship which would serve theAdmiralty purposes.(c) Over 3 million tons of shipping was at present being used on admiralty account, on voyage-charter. Could it not be arranged thatthe additional requirements for the Fleet Train should be met fromthis source? Though some of these ships were used only intermit-tently for Admiralty work, it was estimated that about 2 million tons were continuously employed on Admiralty account.[30143-5]b 3
The Cabinet were informed that the Admiralty would be willing to draw on this shipping, towards the needs of the FleetTrain, if they were free to select from it what ships they wishedIt&apos; was, however, agreed that it would be impossible to surrender tothe Admiriafty any reffigerated shipping^ &apos;After further discussion, the Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with the FirstLord of the Admiralty and the Minister of War Trans-port, to determine on their behalf to what extent and by what means the demands of the Admiralty for furthershipping for the Fleet Train could be met.Civil Aviation,(Previous   &quot;reference: .W.M.(45)27thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet were informed that on the following daythere would be a debate in the House&apos; of Commons on a Supplemeh-tary Estimate relating to Civil Aviation, in the course of which itwould be desirable to make some statement of the government&apos;s policy with regard to P^estwick airport.The Minister of Civil Aviation explained that it was proposedto designate Prestwick as an air port at which air lines from over-seas would be entitled to land. In view of the greater convenience of a Transatlantic terminal in the South of England, he thought itwould be impossible to require foreign operators to land at prestwick.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that.during the warover  3 million had been spent by the Government on Prestwick air-port, and1 it had been constantly used for Transatlantic traffic. Inthese circumstances he felt that Prestwick should be regarded as theprincipal Transatlantic airport, until Heath Row was opened, andthat thereafter Prestwick should be regarded as an alternative air-port for Transatlantic traffic. Merely to designate the airport as one at which aircraft from overseas would be entitled to land wasnot sufficient. There was very strong feeling on this matter inScotland,After discussion, The Minister of Civil Aviation said that, inorder to meet the point of view put forward by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, he would be willing to consider requiring Britishoperators to land at Prestwick, at any rate for a limited number ofyears, provided that Prestwick was not regarded as a terminal andthat operators would be entitled after landing there to fly the sameaircraft on to an airport in the south of England.The Lord Privy Seal said that, apart from the question ofPrestwick airport, there was a strong feeling in Scotland that thepresent plans of the Minister of Civil Aviation would not giveScottish operators a sufficient opportunity to share in the develop-meht of civil aviation in this country. Although it was true thatlines which had been operating in Scotland before the war would beentitled to resume their pre-war internal services, and although allScottish operators would be able to compete on equal terms for ashare in the United Kingdom internal services, no opportunityWould be given to Scottish operators to run services overseas.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that it would be impossible without wrecking the whole scheme, to allow Scottish operators to run overseas airlines in competition with the authorised air corpora-tions. He would, however, be prepared to consider&quot; the possibilityof excluding, say, one or two particular overseas routes (e.g., to scandinavia) from the generalscheme and allotting them to Scottishoperators. - &apos; -&quot; - -   &apos; &apos; i: ?    f&quot;&apos;Summing up the discussion. The Prime Minister said that itwas most important to remove any grounds for the suggestion thatScotland was being treated unfairly in this matter. The proposal made by the Minister of Civil Aviation with regard to Prestwickairport appeared to go a long way to meet the views of the Secretary
31CM. 5 (15).of State for Scotland. On the second point, it should be possible to devise a formula which would make it clear that, although the precise methods to be adopted required detailed consideration, the guiding principle would be that Scottish operators should be given a fair opportunity of sharing in the development of civil aviation.He suggested that a Committee of Ministers should meet early onthe following day in order to draft a statement, covering both points,which could be used in the debate on the Supplementary Estimate.The Cabinet-*Invited the President of the Board of Trade and Ministerof Production, together with the Lord Privy Seal, theSecretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of war transport and the Minister of Civil Aviation to draft,and to submit to the Prime Minister, a statement for Usein the debate, dealing both with the future of Prestwickairport and with the question of participation of Scottishinterests in the development of civil aviation.travel facilities.Exit Permitsfor Members ofParliament.(previous reference erence:W.M. (45) 55thConclusions,Minute 5.)6.   The Cabinet had before them the following Memoranda-W.P. (45) 296 : by the Minister of Information, on thequestion of applications from Members of Parliament for facilities to visit the United States; and cp. (45) 1: by the Home Secretary, on the general questionof the grant of facilities for overseas travel to Members ofParliament.The Home Secretary explained that under the existing policyexit permits were not granted to any person between the ages of 16and 60 unless (i) his permanent home was overseas; or (ii) hisjourney was certified by a Government Department to be in thenational interest, or (iii) there were urgent compassionate grounds for the journey. With the end of the war in Europe the need forthese close restrictions was disappearing, and he hoped shortly tobe able to submit proposals which would allow the free departure from this country of &quot;any British subjects except men between the ages of 18 and 30 and persons known to be disaffected. Therewould be no such man-power or security reasons for refusing anexit permit to a Member of Parliament, and he suggested that exitpermits should now be granted freely to Members of Parliament inadvance of any relaxation of the restrictions applicable to thegeneral public.The proposal put forward by the Minister of Information in w.P. (45) 296 was that his Department should no longer be requiredto certify that it was in the national interest for a Member (ofParliament to make a visit to the United States which was con-nected with purposes of publicity. The Home Secretary pointedout that, if his wider proposal were approved, the question raised in W.P. (45) 296 would no longer arise..The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal put forward by the Home Secretaryill CP. (45) 1;(2) Agreed that a Parliamentary Question for answer by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the following day about the particular case of Mr. Ehys Davies, M.P.(to whidh reference was made in W.P. (45) 296) shouldbe answered to the effect that the Government hadreviewed the general question of overseas travel byMembers of Parliament, and an announcement on thissubject would be made by the Home Secretary in thecourse of the next few da vs.
GeneralElection.postponement of Pollingin CertainConstituencies.(previous reference erence:CM. (45) 1stConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (45) 10)about the postponement of polling day in certain constituencieswhere a large proportion of the electors, would be away from their homes on 5th July as a result of Wakes and similar trade holidays.It was proposed that legislation should be passed before the dissolution providing that in the constituencies listed in theAppendix to this Memorandum polling day should be held on a datelater than the 5th July.After discussion, the Cabinet reached the following conclusions on the points raised in this Memorandum (1) The Bill should provide, as regards the majority of the constituencies listed in the Appendix, that pollingshould take place on 12th July.(2) The Bill should, however, provide that polling should takeplace on 19th July in certain specified constituencieswhere a substantial number of electors would be absent. on holiday on both 5th and 12th July.(3) The Home Secretary should have discretion, in preparing the Bill, to add to the list annexed to CP. (45) 10 anyfurther constituencies in respect of which he was satisfied that postponement pi polling day would be advantageous because a substantial number of electorswould be absent on holiday on 5th July; and should also have discretion to withdraw &quot;from that list anyconstituency in respect of which he was satisfied, after consulting the Member for the constituency (and ifpossible the opposing candidates) that there was no general desire in the constituency for postponement ofthe polling day.(4) No provision should be made for two polling days to beheld in constituencies where an equally large numberof electors would be away on holiday on 5th, 12th and19th July.(5) Government Departments who had advised the staggeringof holidays should not take any initiative in advisingthat holiday arrangements which clashed with pollingday should be altered.ReferenceW.M.(45)12thConclusions,Minute 5.)General 8.   The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the PrimeElection. Minister and Minister of Defence (CP. (45) 6) regarding .thePolitical wearing of uniform by candidates at the Election, and the partici-Activities by pation of members of the Armed Forces in political activities in theMembers of HisUnited Kingdom.Majesty&apos;s    . The proposals, which were intended to operate only between theForces. date of the Dissolution and the Poll, were (i) that all candidates, whether former Members of parliament or not, should be entitled to wear uniform while taking part in theElection, whether in their own constituencies or elsewhere;(ii) that no change should be made in the rule that regularmembers of the Armed Forces should not play an active part in theElection, whether in uniform or plain clothes; and(iii) that temporary members of the Armed Forces should wearplain clothes if they wished to take any active part in the Election,such as going on the platform or speaking or intervening in theproceedings.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposal that candidates should be entitled to wear uniform, provided thatthis concession was restricted to persons who were serving or had served, in the present war.With regard to the active participation in the Election bymembers of the Armed Forces other than candidates, it was pointedout that in practice there would be considerable difficulty in
33CM. 5 (45).discriminating between regular and temporary members of the armed Forces. In view of this, might it not be better to adhere tothe present practice under which, although it was the rule that members of the Armed Forces should not play an active part in politics, thai rule was generally so interpreted that members of theForces were in fact free to attend political meetings in the UnitedKingdom in uniform and to ask questions at such meetings ?On the other hand, it was urged that in view of the very largenumbers of men and women now in the Armed Forces, there was much to be said for the proposal that temporary members of the armed Forces should be free to take an active part in the Election,provided that they wore plain clothes. If it was, in fact, impossibleto distinguish between temporary and regular members in thismatter, would the better &quot;course not be to relax the rules as regardsboth regular and temporary members on the present occasion ?The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposal in paragraph 2 (b) of CP. (45) 6that all bona fide candidates, whether former Membersof Parliament or not, should be entitled to wear uniform; while taking part in political activities connected withthe General Election, whether in their own con-stituencies or elsewhere, on the understanding that the concession should be confined to persons who wereserving, or had served, during the present war.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council, together withthe Minister of Labour and National Service, theSecretary of State for the Colonies, the Secretary ofState for Air and the Chief Whip, to make recom-mendations regarding the extent to which, during theGeneral Election, regular and temporary members ofthe Armed Forces should be allowed to take part in political activities in the United Kingdom.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th June, 1945.
