(45) 13thConclusions,Minute 7,).2.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Minister of Health (CP. (45) 79)submitting proposals for the requisitioning of emptyhouses for the accommodation of inadequately housedfamilies; and(ii) a note by the Prime Minister (CP. (45) 83) on the activitiesof the Vigilantes.The Minister of Health said that there was an immediate needfor over a million houses and that, however successful the house-building programme might be, relatively few new houses would beready for occupation before the spring. Large numbers of men released from the Services would wish to establish homes, and theonly way of meeting the critical situation during the coming months was by ensuring that the most effective use was made ofexisting accommodation. From 1939 onwards authority to requisition unoccupied houses had been delegated to clerks of localauthorities for various purposes (e.g., for accommodating evacuatedfamilies, families rendered homeless by enemy action, or warworkers), and experience, particularly in London, had shown that by requisitioning it was possible to secure that available accom-modation was used to the full. In August 1943 the delegatedauthority was extended to include the requisitioning of unoccupiedhouses for families who were inadequately housed, but in suchcases, before requisitioning took place, the intention of the ownerhad to be.ascertained and he had to be afforded a reasonable oppor-tunity to re-let or occupy the house. The condition had led in manycases to fictitious tenancies followed by sales at enhanced prices,or to the occupation of large houses capable of accommodating twoor three families by childless couples. It was accordingly proposedthat the condition should be varied and that clerks to localauthorities should be authorised to requisition unoccupied houses for inadequately housed persons, provided that after a house hadbeen requisitioned and before it was actually brought intooccupation by the local authority (i) notice of the requisition would be sent to the owner or,       his agent through the post or, if the necessary name and address were not known, would be posted on thepremises;     ,(ii) the local authority would wait ten days after sending orposting the notice before bringing the house intooccupation; and(iii) where the owner notified his intention to occupy the houseby himself or his family, the authority would not proceed further except with the special consent of the SeniorRegional Official of the Ministry of Health.It had been suggested at a meeting of the Housing Squadearlier in the day that notice should also be given by advertisementin local newspapers, but he doubted the value of this. He proposed,however, that a notice should be posted in the house in all cases andnot only in those cases where the name and address of the ownerwere unknown.Discussion concentrated in the first instance on the conditions to be applied to an owner who, when his house Was requisitioned,intimated that he desired to occupy or let it.   It was pointed outthat under, the proposals in CP. (45) 79 an owner would be able: to retain his house only if he himself or his family proposed to[30622-1] :       ... b 2
occupy it, and that paragraph 7 suggested that even then it mightbe open to the local authority to object on the ground that theowner or his family would not use the house to its full capacity. Ifthe Minister of Health did not propose to take steps against familiesalready in occupation of houses which were too large for them, it seemed unfair to refuse to allow an owner to return to his house on the ground that he would not fully occupy the accommodation in it. Moreover, was it reasonable to give the local authority powerto object to the letting of the house to a tenant chosen by the owner ?Apart from other objections, this proposal to make a distinctionbetween occupation by the owner or his family and a let to an ordinary tenant would raise the difficulty of interpreting the term&quot; family.&quot; Attention was also drawn to the position of an owner&quot;whose house had been requisitioned but who at a later date wishedto return to it. Paragraph 5 of CP. (45) 79 stated that in suchcases the local authority, wherever possible, would find alternative accommodation for the family which had been put into the house.Should there not be an obligation on the local authority to findalternative accommodation as soon as possible ?With regard to the notice to be given to owners whose housesit was proposed to requisition, it was suggested that the period often days proposed in CP. (45) 79 was insufficient and that fourteen days would be a more reasonable time.The Minister of Health said that if the Cabinet felt it right todo so, he was prepared to agree that where the owner or his familydesired to occupy the house no question should be raised as towhether they would occupy it to its full capacity. He felt, however,that it would be impossible to allow the owner to retain possessionof the house only because he could produce any kind of a tenant for it, since this would inevitably lead to evasion. At the same time,the local authority would not be precluded from accepting an offerfrom an owner to let the house to a tenant of his own choice,provided that this enabled the accommodation in the house to be fully used. No difficulty should arise in practice in interpretingthe term &quot;family.&quot; With regard to the owner whose house hadbeen requistiioned and who subsequently returned, he was preparedto accept the suggestion that local authorities should be obliged toprovide alternative accommodation for the family in the house assoon as possible.Other points in discussion were : -(a) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that any proposals approved by the Cabinet would apply to Scotland, although theconditions there were such as to make it unlikely that the powers would be exercised to any great extent. Since owners as well asoccupiers paid rates in Scotland, it might be necessary to make special arrangements to prevent owners whose houses wererequisitioned from being penalised.(b) The Minister of Works said that when property which hadbeen requisitioned by a Government Department was to bederequisitioned the Ministry of Works had to notify other Govern-ment Departments who might desire to obtain the propertyfor their own use. This process involved a delay of about sevenweeks during which the property remained unoccupied. If thenew proposals of the Minister of Health were approved it seemed desirable that this period should be reduced.(c) The Minister of Health said that he did not propose togive any indication of the time for which the new proposals would remain in force. They were, of course, based on the exercise ofthe powers conferred by Defence Regulation 51, and it would befor the Government to consider how long that Defence Regulationshould remain in force.Summing up the discussion, The Chancellor of the exchequer said that there seemed to be general agreement with the proposals in CP. (45) 79, subject to certain modifications.    In particular,
the period of notice to be given to the owner or his agent shouldbe fourteen days instead of ten. If within that period the ownerintimated that he or his family proposed to re-occupy the house,he should be allowed to do so without question; and it would alsobe open to the local authority to consider on merits any offer byan owner to let the house to a tenant of his own choice. Whereaction by the local authority had been suspended on an intimation that the owner or his family intended to reoccupy the house or where the local authority had agreed to a proposal by the ownerto put in it a tenant of his own choice, the local authority shouldtake steps within a reasonable period, say, three weeks, to ensurethat the owner had, in fact, carried out his intention and should report to the Senior Regional Officer of the Ministry of Healthany cases in which this had not been done. In order to reducethe number of cases in which difficulties arose through the localauthority not knowing the name and address of the owner, theMinistry of Health should take steps to encourage owners of un-occupied houses to let the local authority know their address or the address of the agent who was looking after the property for them.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in CP. (45) 79, subject to the modifications indicated at &quot; X &quot; above.(2) Agreed in principle that the period during which propertyderequisitioned by one Government Department wasretained with a view to ascertaining whether it was required by another Department should be reduced, and invited the Minister of Works to take up the matter with the Departments concerned.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had replied tothe Minute from the Prime Minister (CP. (45) 83) but that hethought that the Cabinet should consider what further steps mightbe taken to prevent the seizure of empty houses by Vigilantes.The Minister of Information said that so far as the news-papers were concerned, he agreed with his predecessor that a directrequest from (the Government to curtail the publicity given tothe incidents would not achieve the desired end. There were clearsigns that the newspaper agitation was decreasing and theannouncement of the new proposals for requisitioning unoccupiedhouses for the use of persons inadequately housed would have agood effect and should be given as much publicity as possible. Itwould be preferable if the announcement were made by the Ministryof Health in the usual way, but he would be glad to consult withthe Minister with regard to the possibility of giving some guidance on the matter to friendly editors.With regard to action by the police it was explained that,although it was more difficult to prevent incidents in a large arealike London than in Brighton, the police had been instructed tomake every effort to prevent further incidents. The indicationswere that the situation was improving.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Minister of Health and the Minister ofInformation to consider the best arrangements for publicity with regard to the proposals for requisitioningunoccupied houses.(4) Invited the Home Secretary to ensure that the police tookall possible steps to prevent further incidents.[30622-1]
3.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Paymaster-General (C.P. (45) 65)suggesting that urgent steps should be taken to increasethe number Of students taking Arts courses at the universities; and(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService (CP. (45) 80) setting out proposals for therelease of Arts and Theological students from theForces. -The Minister of Labour and National Service said that his proposal was that before October 1945 up to 3,000 students who wished to take Arts courses at the Universities should be released in Class B. Only men with approximately three years&apos; militaryservice would be released, and those released should be of scholar-ship standard and should be nominated for release by the Universityconcerned. Existing quotas of Class B releases for otherindustries and professions would not be prejudiced, since the expected increase of releases in Class A during the second half of1945 would enable a larger number of persons to be released in class B without raising ^it above 10 per cent, of Class A. Hewould discuss the details of the scheme with the Committee ofVice-Chancellors of the Universities. In addition, he proposedthat steps should be taken to release in Class B up to 1,500Theological students over the period of eight months during whichthe first 100,000 Class B releases would take place. This concession would cover churches of all denominations.In discussion there was general agreement as to the urgency of increasing the number of Arts students at the Universities.It was pointed out, however, that it would be important to ensurethat the means adopted for this purpose did not give rise todiscontent in the Services. For this reason the proposal of theMinister of Labour and National Service to release students whohad already done three years&apos; military service was to be preferred to the second of the two suggestions made in CP. (45) 65, viz.,that men who gained open scholarships should be granteddeferment from military service until they had taken their degrees.Other points in discussion were : *(a) It was pointed Out that there might be some complainton the ground that the release of students would favour officers asagainst other ranks. On the other hand, it was pointed out thatthe great bulk of the remaining releases in Class B would consist ofother ranks.(6) It was suggested that in order to minimise any risk of grievance in the Forces arrangements should be made, should there be an overall shortage of places at the Universities, to give firstpreference to students in the earlier release groups under the demobilisation scheme. The Minister of Labour and NationalService undertook to consider this point in consultation with theCommittee of Vice-Chancellors.(c) It was agreed that the same principles should apply to therelease of students who were commissioned officers in the indian army and Navy and the Secretary of State for India undertook todiscuss the detailed arrangements with the Minister of Labour and national Service.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals for the release of Arts andTheological students set out in CP. (45) 80 on the under-standing that in putting them into force the Minister ofLabour and National Service would take all possible stepsto avoid creating any sense of unfairness in the Services.Release of students tonthe Forces.
Agricultural :Policy.CroppingDirections and prices ofAgriculturalCommoditiesfor the 1946Harvest.(previous reference erehce:W.M.(44)59thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them, a . memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries (CP. (45) 81) regarding thecropping directions, acreage payments and price applicable tocertain agricultural commodities for the 1946 &quot;harvest.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries recalled that whenthe question of the 1945. and 1946 prices for the principalagricultural commodities had been considered by the lord presidents Committee in March (L.P. (45) 13th Meeting) it hadbeen agreed that at a later date the possibility of relaxing directions to grow certain commodities for the 1946 harvest and of making certain reductions in the acreage payments and prices should beconsidered. After consultation with the Ministry of Food and theTreasury he had come to the conclusion that there was a good case for maintaining by directions approximately the existing produc-tion of potatoes and sugar beet in 1946, and that there should beno change in the present acreage payment and prices of potatoesand in the price of sugar beet. With regard to wheat, however, world supplies were large and it should be possible without directions tosecure a wheat acreage in 1946 of &apos;2j million acres. If compulsorydirections to grow wheat were relaxed it would be possible to reducethe acreage payment by  2 per acre. It was most important fromthe standpoint of long-term policy that a downward movement in agricultural prices should begin, both in general, grounds and because, unless a downward movement had started for a keycommodity like wheat, there was a real risk of further pressure for increases of wages. Even if directions were retained for the growing of wheat the additional acreage sown was not likely to exceed   million.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food said thatthe Ministry of Food agreed that it was desirable that a down-ward movement of agricultural prices should be started. they hoped, however, that the wheat acreage in 1946 would not fall below 2^ million.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the proposals in CP. (45) 81 would apply to Scotland.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in paragraph 6 of CP. (45) 81relating to cropping directions, acreage payments and prices of agricultural commodities for the 1946 harvest.Labour for 5.   The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that hethe 1948 was seriously concerned about the supply of labour for the 1945Harvest. harvest.   It had been agreed that 60,000 prisoners of war should(Previous be made available to assist in the harvest, but up to the present itEef erence: had been impossible to provide accommodation for more than 30,000.CM. (45)8th The harvest was now imminent and unless&apos; the most vigorous actionConclusions, could be taken by the Departments concerned to  assist the minute 4.) Agricultural Departments in obtaining the necessary accommoda-tion a very serious situation would develop.The Minister of Works said that difficulties had arisen overthe provision of sites for the camps and that it seemed clear thatit would be necessary to take urgent steps to provide accommodationeven at the expense of relaxing standards in such matters assanitation and water supply. It would be helpful if the AirMinistry would allow the use for the accommodation of prisonersof war of any redundant accommodation at airfields.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Works and the Service ministers to take all possible steps to assist the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to secure accommodation for prisoners ofwar employed in the 1945 harvest.
The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries said that.he wouldbe glad if steps could be taken to relax the conditions under which men were temporarily released from the Army for agricultural work,.At present men were granted 28 days&apos; ,leave,. but if fhis,,period was extended even by a few days the whole period of leave given wasdeducted from the man&apos;s record of service for the purposes of the demobilisation scheme. Would it not be. possible for the  services to release 2,000 skilled agricultural workers for a period of tHreemonths ? the services of these skilled workers would be of greatervalue to agriculture than a much larger number&quot; of less skilled men,and if they were released for the longer period there would be a saving in transport.In discussion it was pointed out that it would not be possibleto release men from the Army or from the Royal Air Force for as long a period as three months, although it might be possible toagree to a certain number of releases from the Royal Navy,provided that they were limited to men in the United kingdom or in home waters who were within the first, twenty-eightgroups for the purposes of the demobilisation scheme. On theother hand, some slight extension of the period of twenty-eight days&apos; leave could probably be arranged. The War Office were con-sidering the extension of the grant of leave for agricultural work tomen in the B.L.A. as well as to men in this country and all three service Departments would do what they could to make men available for agricultural work in districts where they werestationed.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Service Ministers to consider the points madein discussion in consultation with the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland with a view to ensuring that the Servicesgave the maximum assistance in connection with the1945 harvest.India. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous       Secretary of State for India (CP. (45) 84) to which was attachedReference:      correspondence with tbe Viceroy regarding certain statementsCM. (45) 14th  alleged, to have been made to the Press by Maulana Azad, PresidentConclusions,    of the Congress on the conclusion of the Simla Conference.Minute 5.) The statements in question were to the effect that Azad,before entering the Conference, had discussed with the Viceroythe position of the Indian Army and the Indian States, that asregards the treatment of the areas to be liberated in South-east asia he had made it clear that Congress, while agreed that Indiaunder the proposed new Government would continue the war against Japan, would contribute neither in men nor money torestoring these areas to their former imperialist owners; and thaton all these matters he had received replies from the Viceroy whichcould be regarded as satisfactory.    .These statements were not consistent with the reports that had been received from the Viceroy, and Lord Wavell, who hadbeen asked for his comments on them, had now replied that whileAzad had touched on these matters in conversation before theConference, and had specifically referred to them at the firstmeeting of the Conference, he (Lord WaveU) bad replied in openConference that he would oppose any suggestion that the indian army should become a political issue, and that the future of liberated countries in South-East Asia would be a matter forseveral Governments, though the Government of India would be; r- perfectly entitled to express their views. He had added that theGovernor-General in Council could have: no political control overthe Indian States; though matters of common concern to british india and the States were, of course, constantly discussed. these statements had not been contested by Mr. Azad. Lord Wavelladded that unless Azad&apos;s statement to the Press was repeated
107 CM. 45 (45). 75and detailed contradiction was unavoidable, in which case he wouldwrite to Azad, he thought it better on the whole not to enter intocontroversy with him or other leaders about their statements tothe Press. Once correspondence began he would be forced to argueevery point in public, which was undesirable.The Secretary of State for India said that it was clear thatAzad had grievously misrepresented what had passed between him and the Viceroy. Lord wavell&apos;s reports showed that theConference had accepted without reservation that any new Councilmust be committed to the principles which the Viceroy with theapproval of the Cabinet had laid down with regard to the prosecution of the war against Japan, and that they equallyaccepted his statement about the disposal of territories in the far east.In discussion the following points were made -(a) Azad&apos;s misrepresentation had been very deliberate and specific. It would almost certainly have received wide publicity in the Congress Press and, failing a dementi now, it might be usedto embarrass us if, at a later stage, Congress wished to justify a refusal to co-operate in the war against Japan..(b) It was suggested, on the other hand, that while Azad&apos;sstatement showed clearly his dangerous and slippery character,and would be a warning to us in any future dealings with him,and while there was a risk that his statement might lead tomisunderstandings, a formal denial might lead to a long andunedifying exchange of letters, and might also give Azad the chancehe wanted to indulge in further misleading statements.After discussion the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that hethought the general sense of the Cabinet was that the balance ofadvantage rested with accepting the Viceroy &apos;s view that unless there was a repetition of these statements, in which case theViceroy was prepared to write to Azad, it would be best to leavethings as they were. Lord Wavell&apos;s reply to Azad in the Confer-ence had not been contested and covered the ground. The Viceroymight well be advised to communicate confidentially the authoritative-tive record of the proceedings to those concerned on the basis thatthey would like to have this authoritative record of what had passed. If this were done we should be better placed to deal withAzad if at a later stage he repeated unfounded suggestions suchas those now under consideration.The Cabinet-Endorsed  the  suggestion  of  the   Chancellor  of  theExchequer at &quot; X &quot; and&apos; invited the Secretary of Statefor India to communicate with the Viceroy on these lines.Supplies of 7.   The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that heTimber. understood that arrangements were being made to transfer toGermany the Home Grown Timber Production Department with aview to our obtaining supplies of timber from Germany. He wasin favour of this but he would be glad to have further informationas to what was proposed.In discussion there was general agreement as to the advantageof ceasing felling operations in this country as soon as possible.The Cabinet-Invited the President of the Board of Trade and Ministerof Production to furnish the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland with information with regard to the proposals.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,19th July, 1945.
