The Chiefs of Staff reported the events of the previous six days.In Europe, air operations had been limited to transport,reconnaissance and leaflet dropping. 3,500 sorties had been flown.Bombers had flown over 2,000 released prisoners of war to thiscountry and 2,000 French troops from Italy to Marseilles.During the whole period of the war in Europe the British AirSea Rescue Service had saved 13,462 airmen, including about,000 members of the United States Air Force.In Buimia the monsoon continued to restrict air operations, andthe transport of supplies to our forces was being hindered in conse-quence. The number of sorties had fallen from a weekly averageof about 10,000 to only 2,500. In addition to transport of men and supplies, strategic attacks had been made on the Bangkok-Singapore railway and mines had been laid in the Gulf of Siam.In China the weather had been bad and the United States AirForce had flown only 250 sorties in support of the Chinese Army inthe Chungking area.In the Pacific 5,000 sorties had been flown, for the loss of 3aircraft, and attacks had been made on ports, airfields and railways.Super Fortresses had flown 1,000 sorties and dropped5,650 tons of bombs, for the loss of 10 aircraft, on Tokyo and other targets in Japan.The Combined Intelligence Committee estimated that, as aresult of the strategic bombing of Japan, Japanese production ofcombat aircraft had fallen from 2,000 a month in January last to1,180 a month.The Cabinet were informed that there were now only 4 U-boatswhich could have sufficient fuel to be still at sea. 151 serviceableU-boats were now under British or American control, of which 110were in ports in the United Kingdom. 78 U-boats were known tohave been scuttled by the enemy.Over 120 German minesweepers were now operating under allied control off North-West Germany, Denmark and Norway.These were reported to have swept 32 mines during the previousweek.The French cruiser Jeanne d&apos;Arc was still at Bizerta, havingdisembarked 800 Moroccan troops at that port.On the 8th June, H.M. Submarine Trenchant had torpedoed and sunk an 8-inch Japanese cruiser of the &quot; Ashigara &quot; class closein-shore off the east coast of Sumatra. A similar Japanese cruiserhad been sunk by our destroyers three weeks ago, and it was believedthat this accounted for all the operative Japanese cruisers in the singapore area. There were, however, another two in dock at singapore.The First Sea Lord was invited to convey to the commander of H.M. Submarine Trenchant the Cabinets congratulations on the sinking of this cruiser.United States forces in Okinawa had made considerable progress during the week and the forces which had landed at Nahahad joined up with the main body. Only a small lodgement of theenemy now remained in the south of the island.On the previous day the 9th Australian Division had made a landing near Brunei and another on Labuan Island. Operations onTarakan Island were going well and about half of the island,including the airfield, was now in our hands.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.[30420-1]
Germany.Separations.(previous reference:W.M.(45)35thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them Memoranda on this subject by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (45) 16) and the Pay-master-General (W.P. (45) 224).The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that a ministerial committee had been appointed by the Coalition Government toprepare draft instructions to the United Kingdom representatives at the forthcoming conference on reparations in Moscow. TheCommittee had considered the main points on which our repre-sentatives would need directions, and had given instructions for thepreparation of a draft report. A draft had been prepared, whichwas reproduced in Annex II to CP. (45) 16, but the Committee hadnot been able to consider this before the break-up of the coalition government. He now submitted in Annex I of CP. (45) 16, for theapproval of the Cabinet, draft instructions for the United kingdom representative, which were based in the main on the recommenda-tions of this draft report.The following were the main points raised in discussion : (a) The Paymaster-General said that the main advantage whichthis country could secure from reparations would be the capture ofGermany&apos;s pre-war export trade. While the draft instructionstook account of this, he would prefer that they should state itexplicitly as one of our main aims.Other Ministers, while agreeing that this was one of the mostimportant advantages which we could hope to gain, thought it wouldbe inexpedient to relate our reparations policy to this objective,still more to avow it as an object of our policy. There would be general approval for a policy of destroying Germany&apos;s war potential; and the adoption of that policy would in practice enable us to capture a substantial part of Germany&apos;s pre-war export trade.But an avowed policy of destroying Germany&apos;s export trade, assuch, would not continue for long to command the support of publicopinion. Moreover, it was likely that the claimants to reparationswould in the result receive much less than they had hoped; and itwas important to avoid a situation in which the disappointment oftheir hopes could be attributed to an avowed British policy of destroying Germany^ export trade. Finally, it was pointed out thatsuch a policy was already being criticised in the United States asboth immoral and unpractical.It was the general view of the Cabinet that our reparationspolicy should not be explicitly related to the destruction ofGermany&apos;s pre-war export trade.(b) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster raised thequestion whether reparations deliveries from current production should be restricted entirely to raw materials and semi-manufac-tured goods. Apart from the point noted at (a) above, we mightwell find it advantageous to import from Germany prefabricatedtimber houses or house components. He therefore suggested thatthe second sentence in paragraph 10 of the draft instructions shouldbe amended so as to provide that current deliveries &quot; should belimited to a specified list consisting mainly of raw materials and semi-manufactured goods.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported this amendment.(c) In paragraph 15 of the draft instructions it was statedthat, while the Reparations Conference should give full weight tothe amount of reparations labour to be received by each claimantcountry, no attempt should be made to put a value on that labour and include it in the percentage allocations.The Paymaster-General suggested that the Commission should include the value of reparations labour in computing the total figureof reparations and the proportions in which it was to be divided between the claimant countries. At the Crimea Conference theSoviet Delegation had proposed a global figure of $20 billion for reparations, excluding labour.   We considered that to be far tor
high a figure; but the Soviet Government, who had not had our experience of reparations problems, were likely to press for theadoption of a target figure of this order. From that point of view it would be convenient if we could set a value on reparations labour,and seek to have that value included in the total. The russians were likely to ask for a large amount of labour, and this would help to build up the reparations total to the large figure which they would demand.The Cabinet were informed that, particularly in view of the differing economic values of labour in different countries, it wouldbe very difficult to get an agreed value for reparations labour. Itwas, however, suggested that various figures cduld be put forward for the comparative value of reparations labour in the variousclaimant countries.The Prime Minister said that in his view this was a questionwhich could with advantage be discussed by the Reparations Corn-mission in Moscow. Comparative figures could be put forward witha view to reaching an agreed value for reparations labour; and theUnited Kingdom representative should argue the case for taking account of the value of labour in fixing both the global total of reparations and the proportions in which this should be divided between the various claimant countries.(d) It had been assumed that we should not put forward any claim to employ reparations labour in this country. The Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster asked whether we might not findadvantage in using such labour for building work in the early yearsof the housing programme. We could by this means get a larger number of houses in the early years, without expanding the buildingindustry beyond its optimum level for steady employment over thenext decade.The Prime Minister said that strong objection could be raised,on both economic and social grounds, to the employment of any large number of German civilians in this country; and he felt thatsuch a course should not be adopted without the approval of thenew Parliament.(e) In paragraph 12 (c) of the draft instructions it was proposed that the countries taking reparations labour should beinvited to sign a declaration prescribing the conditions under which such labour should be employed.The Cabinet agreed that it should be an instruction to our representative at the Reparations Conference that we were unwilling to assume any responsibility for securing the enforcement of the conditions prescribed in such a declaration.(/) The Cabinet were informed that the Russians in roumania had included British property in the term &quot;booty.&quot; It was hopedthat our representative at the Reparations Conference would beable to secure a definition of &quot;booty&quot; which would ensure thatsome compensation was paid for British property seized by theRussians in Roumania.The Cabinet endorsed the recommendation, made in para-graph 4 of Annex II of CP. (45) 16, that the ReparationsConference should be invited to adopt a narrow definition of&quot;booty.&quot;(g) The Cabinet agreed that Dominion Governments should begiven an opportunity to comment on the substance of the instructions which were to be given to the United Kingdom representative at the reparations Conference. The Solicitor-General need not, however,delay his departure to Moscow untirreplies had been received fromall the Dominion Governments. Any modifications adopted as aresult of these comments could be communicated to him after his arrival in Moscow.[30420-1]
(h) The Prime Minister said that, in general, the Solicitor-General should take the line that the object of the Moscow conference was to explore the complex technical aspects of the reparationsproblem. All these questions should be fully discussed; and no opportunity should be lost of bringing home to the Russian repre-sentatives the dangers and difficulties of exacting reparations. Weshould seek to give the Russians the benefit of the experience whichwe had gained in these matters after the last war. Above all, our representative should not commit himself to a global total for reparations. On this and all other points he should continue to keepthe Cabinet fully informed of the progress of the discussions.The Cabinet (1) Appointed a Committee consisting of Chancellor of the Exchequer (in the Chair),President of the Board of Trade and Minister ofProduction,Minister of State,Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,Paymaster-General,to consider on their behalf, and refer to the Cabinet as necessary, all questions arising from the proceedings ofthe Moscow Conference.(2) Invited this Committee to review, in the light of the cabinet&apos;s discussion, the draft instructions embodied in annex I of CP. (45) 16; and to communicate the revisedinstructions on behalf of the Cabinet to the Solicitor-General for his guidance at the Reparations Conference.(3) Invited the Committee to arrange that the substance of the revised instructions were communicated forthwith to theDominion Governments with a request for their com-ments; and that any modifications arising from thosecomments were communicated to the Solicitor-Generalafter his arrival in Moscow.Coal-MiningIndustry.future organisation.(previous reference:W.M. (45)25thConclusions,Minute 9.)3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (CP..(45) 8) asking for authority to instruct Parliamentary Counsel to prepare draft legislation to giveeffect to the statement which he had made in the House of commons on the 29th May on the Government&apos;s policy for the future organisa-tion of the coal-mining industry. Annex II of the Memorandumcontained an outline of the scheme which would form the basis ofthe instructions for the preparation of this draft legislation.In discussion, The Minister of Fuel and Power explained thatno question arose of making any further public statement at thisstage. If, however, the present Government were returned to powerafter the General Election, this legislation should be introduced as early as possible in the first session of the new Parliament; and,as the existing legislation on this subject was complex, the drafting of the new Bill would take some time and he was anxious that itspreparation should be put in hand without delay. He undertook that his Department should consult with the Treasury on the finance of the scheme outlined in Annex II of his Memorandum.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power to instructParliamentary   Counsel   to  start  the   preparation of- legislation to give effect to the scheme outlined in Annex ii of CP. (45) 8.
fsx Damage.Compensationlor damage to Property.Civil Aviation.Relationswith UnitedStatesGovernment.(previous reference:CM. (45) 6thConclusions,Minute 6.)47G.M. 7 (45).4. The Prime Minister asked; how far the contributions sofar levied under the War Damage Act would meet the compensation payable in respect of the damage sustained; and whether it was intended to continue to levy these contributions now that there wasno longer any risk of further air attack on this country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the total damage from air attack was estimated at about  1,150 million, and thecontributions levied under the Act (including those payable on the1st July) would be rather less than half that amount. The Govern-ments intention, as announced in Parliament when the Act waspassed, had been that the total cost of compensation under, thescheme should be shared equally between the Exchequer and thecontributors. The Act provided that the contribution should be levied over a fixed period of years; and it had been indicated that,if in the event the total cost of the damage was substantially morethan twice the total amount received in contributions, parliament would be asked to extend the period during which contributions were payable. If, on the other hand, the total compensation dueproved substantially less than twice the amount of the contributionscollected, Parliament might be invited to authorise a correspondingrefund of contributions. As things had turned out, it was proposedto collect the last contribution due under the existing Act on the1st July, 1945; and to refrain from proposing any fresh legislation to Parliament, either for further contributions or for any refund of past contributions.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, the statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.5. At their meeting on the 8th June the Cabinet had invited the Civil Aviation Committee to consider the suggestion that anyreply to the United States Government setting out the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government with regard to (i) airfields required for international air services; and(ii) civil aviation agreements with foreign Governments ingeneral,should be postponed until the Prime Minister had had anopportunity of discussing these matters with the President of theUnited States.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that at a meeting earlier in the day the Civil Aviation Committee had drafted two separatetelegrams, one dealing with the acquisition of airfields and the otherwith the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to civilaviation in general. The Committee proposed that, in the firstinstance, the reply to the United States Government should be confined to the specific question of airfields, and that the statementof the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government on civil aviation ingeneral should be used only if the State Department pressed for a reply on this aspect of the matter. The intention of Article VIII,Section 9, of the Interim Agreement on Civil Aviation, which hadbeen drafted by the United States Government and signed by themtogether with His Majesty&apos;s Government and the other parties tothe agreement, was that each member State should provide in its territory the airfields required for international air services. our attitude was entirely consistent with this and in these circumstances there seemed to be no ground on which the United States Govern-ment could object to it.The telegram stating the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment on civil aviation in general covered the question of frequenciesand rates.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Foreign Office should despatch to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington telegrams in theterms proposed by the Civil Aviation Committee.
CMl Aviation.Brabazon IType ofCivil Aircraft.Extension ofthe FiltonAirfield.6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Aircraft Production (CP. (45) 25) regarding theprovision of facilities at Pilton airfields, Bristol, for the construc-tion of prototypes of the Brabazon I type of civil aircraft.The Parliamentary- Secretary to the Ministry of aircraft production said that the Lord Presidents Committee had recom-mended that the necessary extension to enable the prototypes tobe flown from Filton airfield should be approved; that consideration should be given to using the airfield as Bristol&apos;s civil airport; andthat legislation for the acquisition of the necessary land should beintroduced. The Minister of Aircraft Production recognised thatit would be impossible to promote the proposed legislation until theautumn and the only step which he desired to take at the presenttime was to begin work on the construction of a large assembly shedneeded for the completion of the prototypes. This shed, the cost ofwhich would be about  600,000, would be built on land alreadybelonging to the.Bristol Aeroplane Company. If work on the shedwas not begun immediately, the completion of the first british aircraft likely to be able to operate a non-stop service to New Yorkwould be seriously delayed.In discussion it was pointed out that any work done on theassembly shed would be wasted unless the further proposal for theextension of Filton airfield were carried out. Paragraph 6 of cp. (45) 25 showed that this further proposal involved theacquisition of 700 acres of agricultural land, and the Cabinet couldnot take a final decision on this at the present time. On the otherhand, it was urged that the expenditure likely to be incurred duringthe next two or three months on the construction of the assemblyshed was not likely to be large and might be regarded as a reasonableinsurance in view of the time which would have been saved if it were then decided to proceed with the major project. There was support for the view that the construction of this assembly shed mightbe put in hand, if the expenditure to be incurred before the1st August, 1945, would not exceed  50,000.Other points in discussion were (a) The Secretary of State for Air said that it had beensuggested to him that, if the runway at Filton would only be needed to fly off the prototype unloaded, it need not be as long as,750 yards. The Minister of Aircraft Production undertook to consult with the Secretary of State on this, point.(&amp;) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries pointed outthat in paragraph 3 of CP. (45) 25 it was proposed that the warning to manufacturers of heavy aircraft that they could hope to obtain orders only if they established themselves in the neigh-bourhood of certain specified airfields should be deferred pending the review of airfield requirements which was to bemade in accordance with the Prime Minister&apos;s Memorandum(W.P. (45) 110). In his view a private warning ought to be givento these firms immediately, so that they should not complete any arrangements - to transfer. their works to airports which were unlikely to be developed for use by very heavy aircraft.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Aircraft Production to submit a schedule of disbursements showing the expendi-ture which would be incurred in each of the monthsover which the construction of the proposedassembly shed would be spread.(2) Agreed that the Minister of Aircraft production should forthwith convey to manufacturers of heavyaircraft a warning on the lines indicated at (b)above.
GeneralElection.(previous reference erence:CM. (45) 5thConclusions,Minute 8.)Date of meeting ofParliament.49CM. 7 (45),7. The Prime Minister said that it was proposed that the new parliament should meet on Wednesday, 1st August. The remainder of that week would be occupied by the swearing-in of Members.Thereafter the debate on the Address and other essential businessmight occupy a further two weeks. Parliament would then, he hoped, adjourn for a Recess of some eight weeks.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.38TravelFacilitiesfor minister during theGeneralElection.The Prime Minister said that he had been asked by theSecretary of State for Air whether during the Election ministers should be allowed to use Service aircraft-(i) when travelling to and from their constituencies; and(ii) when visiting other constituencies.It seemed to him that, in view of their heavy public duties, Ministersought to have the right to use Service aircraft, whether for journeysto their constituencies or to any other places where they might haveto address meetings; but that if such an arrangement were made,the same facilities should be offered to ex-Ministers of Cabinetrank.In discussion it was suggested that, in order to obviate any risk of challenge, the Law Officers should be asked to considerwhether Ministers who used Service aircraft should make some payment and, if so, whether the amount should be included inelection expenses. The Law Officers might also consider whether any principles applicable to the use of Service aircraft should also apply to the use by Ministers of their official cars or of special rail-way facilities.Other points in discussion were (a) There could be no objection to the use of Service aircraft for any journeys which a Minister had to make in pursuance of his official duties (e.g., journeys made by a Minister returning to his9official duties after speaking at an Election meeting).(&amp;) The Air Ministry might have difficulty in providingV.I.P. aircraft for the total number of Ministers and ex-ministers who might seek to use the facilities, but they would make everyeffort to meet the demand.(c) A suitable charge for the use of Service aircraft on this occasion might be the first-class railway fare. For the use of anofficial car, the usual hiring rate might be charged.(d) The Ministry of War Transport were already providingrailway sleeping berths for both Ministers and ex-Ministers forjourneys connected with the Election campaign.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Law Officers, to consider the position underthe Electoral law which would result from makingService aircraft, or other official travel facilities,available to Ministers for journeys connected withthe Election. In particular, should payments bemade and, if so, must such payments be included inElection expenses.(3) Agreed that, subject to any views expressed by the LawOfficers, the facilities accorded to Ministers ofCabinet rank should also be offered to ex-ministers of Cabinet rank.
PoliticalActivitiesby Membersof HisMajesty&apos;forces.(previous reference:CM. (45) 5thConclusions,Minute 8.)At their meeting on the 5th June the Cabinet had invited a!Committee under the Chairmanship of the Lord President of the fCouncil to advise on the extent to which/during the Electionregular and temporary members of the Armed Forces should befallowed to take part in political activities in the United Kingdom.!The Cabinet now had before them a minute by the Prime!Minister and Minister of Defence (CP. (45) 26) to which was Iannexed the Report of the Committee. The Committee recom-mended that both regular and temporary members of the Armed!Forces should be free to attend meetings in uniform, with the rightto ask questions from the body of the hall, but that they should not!be entitled to speak at political meetings or otherwise to play anf]active part in political proceedings unless they wore plain clothes.The Prime Minister said that he felt that difficulties might arise from a rule which provided specifically that members of theForces in uniform had a right to ask questions at a political meeting he had therefore suggested in CP. (45) 26 an alternative para-graph which made no reference to the asking of questions and merelystated that members of the Forces might attend political meetings in uniform or plain clothes, but might not speak or sit on the plat-form or otherwise play an active part in political proceedings unless they wore plain clothes. It was not, of course, his intention thatthere should be a strict prohibition on the asking of questions bymembers of the Forces in uniform, but it would be easier to keepthe practice within reasonable bounds if the right to do so werenot specifically recognised.If the Cabinet approved the revised proposals, he would takethe opportunity to announce them in reply to a parliamentary question which had been set down for answer on the following day.Instructions to the three Services could be issued thereafter.The Cabinet (4) Approved the recommendations in the report annexed to CP. (45) 26, subject to the substitution of the alternative]paragraph 3 suggested by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11th June, 1945.
