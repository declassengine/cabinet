Disposal of the 1. The Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the FirstGerman and Lord of the Admiralty (CP. (45) 67 and 74) on the disposal of theItalian Fleets. German and the Italian Fleets.(Previous j,^ .p^rst Lorrf 0j f^g Admiralty proposed that, so far asWM^uuntTi concerne(i tne German fleet, we should strongly support the. .(44) 40th American view that there should be a wholesale scrapping of combatOoncusions, units with the exception of vessels which were required formu e 7 experimental or immediate operational purposes or were capable ofbeing converted to civilian use. If, however, the Russians refusedto accept this proposal, we should suggest a division of the german fleet on the lines indicated in paragraph 11 of CP. (45) 67, the maineffect of which was to give the Russians the minimum number of u-boats. Dominion Governments were npt likely to raise any objection, provided that the policy was explained to them inadvance; and, although the proposals might lead to some disappoint-ment among our minor Allies, they had not any real grounds of complaint in view of the generous treatment which they had receivedfrom us during the war. The proposals in CP. (45) 67 had beeninformally communicated to Admiral King, who had indicated thatin principle he fully agreed with them.With regard to the Italian fleet,,it had been agreed at Tehranthat the Russian share should be one battleship, one cruiser, eight destroyers and four submarines. Subsequently, in view of the objection to the immediate transfer of Italian ships to Russia, itwas agreed to lend to the Soviet Navy a United States cruiser, theBritish battleship Royal Sovereign, eight old &quot; Town &quot;-classdestroyers and four submarines. We ourselves had originallyclaimed two &quot; Littorio &quot;-class battleships, while France, Greece and yugoslavia had also put forward claims for a share of the italian fleet. The problem was to find a settlement which, withoutestranging Italy, would meet inescapable Allied claims and reducethe Italian Navy to a size acceptable to her neighbours. With thisobject it was proposed that the original Russian claim to one&quot;Cavour &quot; battleship, one six-inch cruiser, eight destroyers and foursubmarines should be met in full. In addition, Greece shouldreceive two six-inch cruisers and one further damaged six-inch cruiser for cannibalisation. There should be no transfer of italian ships to France, whose claims should be met by the allocation ofGerman ships; and Yugoslavia should at most receive one or twotorpedo boats. Although we did not require either of the two&quot; Littorio &quot;-class battleships, we should claim both (or one, if theUnited States desired to claim the other) and should appropriatethese ships at the Peace settlement unless ultimately it wasconsidered necessary to be more lenient with regard to the italian fleet, in which case the two &quot; Littorios &quot; might be left in Italianhands instead of the two old &quot; Cavour &quot;-class ships which would otherwise compose the Italian battleship force.In discussion it was suggested that if there was no practicaladvantage in recovering the ships which we had lent to Russia itmight be expedient, subject to agreement with the Americans, to propose to the Russians in the first instance that they should retain the ships which had been lent to them in respect of their originalclaim to ships from the Italian fleet. If the Russians accepted thisproposal, we should be in a position to treat Italy more lenientlyshould this seem desirable, e.g., by increasing the number of destroyers to be retained by her. If, on the other hand, the Russiansinsisted on securing their share of the Italian ships, they should be only allowed to retain the British ships in return for some financialconsideration or some other countervailing advantage, e.g., in thenegotiations over the German Fleet.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to consider whetherthe proposals in paragraphs 7 (a) and 11 of CP. (45) 74should be amended in the light of the suggestion madein the discussion.[30421-4]b 2
(2) Subject to the preceding conclusion, agreed that theproposals in CP (45) 67 and 74 should be adopted asa basis for any negotiations at the Three-Power meeting with regard to the disposal of the German and Italianfleets.2.   The Cabinet had before them the following MemorandaCP. (45) 72 : by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, submittingrevised proposals for the release of men and women fromthe Services and munitions industries in the second halfof 1945.CP. (45) 75 : by the Secretary of State for Air, regarding the size of the V.L.R. bomber force.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that at their meetingon the 6th July the Cabinet had invited the Man-Power Committeeto submit revised proposals for releases from the Services in thesecond half of 1945 and had drawn special attention to thedesirability of increasing the release of women from the Services.The Prime Minister had subsequently suggested as a target that500,000 women should be released from the Services and munitions industries during the next three months.The Man-Power Committee were satisfied that it would be impracticable to proceed on the basis that any woman who wishedto leave the Services should be free to do so. Such a policy ofuncontrolled release would have the result that several importantbranches in each Service would be faced with deficiencies involvingtotal breakdown, and that throughout the branches where women were employed efficiency would suffer. It would also havethe effect of retarding the release of men in Class A and might produce discontent, which would endanger the demobilisation scheme as a whole. The Committee had therefore considered how far itwould be possible to increase the releases of women from the Serviceswithout abandoning the existing principles of the demobilisationscheme; and, after discussion with the Service Ministers, they now put forward proposals for an increase from 135,000 to 200,000 inthe releases of women and for an increase of 200,000 in the releasesof men in Class A. The Service Ministers had undertaken to do their utmost to reach these new targets, though they could not guarantee to do so.The Committee also suggested that the Service and SupplyMinisters should find means of increasing by 100,000 the releases from the munitions industries in the second half of 1945.Even if these new targets could be achieved the position wouldbe far from satisfactory; and the Committee desired to impress onthe Cabinet that, if we were to make satisfactory progress with the tasks of reconstruction at home, we ought to seek some means of limiting our military commitments in Stage II, whether for active operations in the Ear East or for garrison duty in Europe and theMiddle East. ...In discussion it was suggested, on behalf of the Service Depart-ments, that even to achieve the revised targets proposed in cp. (45) 72 would involve some limitation of our military commit-ments. So far as concerned the Army, no great sayings could beexpected from the relatively small numbers which were being sent tothe Far East, and reductions must be sought in the main among our occupation troops in Europe and the Middle East. Although it was true that the proposals of the Man-Power Committee did not meanmore than advancing into 1945 releases which would in any casetake place in 1946, the result of the acceleration would be to weaken our forces very substantially at what might be a very critical time.The Secretary of State for Air said that these new proposalsimposed a much heavier burden on the Royal Air Force than on theother two Services. The Royal Air Force were, in effect, being asked to bring forward into 1945 a very much higher percentageMan-Power.(previous reference erence:CM. (45) 11thConclusions,Minute 4.)
of the total releases planned up to the 31st May, 1946; and to giveeffect to the Committee&apos;s proposals might lead to such disorganisation-tion that our air forces in the United Kingdom and in Europe wouldbe virtually ineffective during the period of redeployment. Hesuggested that, before a final decision was taken, the Chiefs of staff should be invited to review the implications of the cuts, and thatin the course of this review they should be empowered to make,within the global total, readjustments of the target figures proposed for each Service in order to achieve a fair distribution of thetotal cut.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to examine, and report as soonas possible on, the operational implications of giving effect to the proposals made in paragraphs 3 and 5 of cp. (45) 72 for accelerating the release of men andwomen from the Armed Forces; and agreed that in thecourse of their review it would be open to them to propose such adjustments in the target figure proposed for each Service as seemed reasonable provided that the global target figures were not thereby reduced.(2) Invited the Service Ministers meanwhile to take allpossible steps to accelerate releases of men and women from the Forces with a view to securing the maximumaddition to the labour available for civil industry in1945.(3) Invited the Service and Supply Ministers to find means ofsecuring the release of an additional 100,000 men andwomen from the munitions industries in the second halfof 1945.(4) Endorsed the views expressed in paragraph 8 of cp. (45) 72 regarding the need for limiting our military commitments in Stage II, and asked the foreign secretary to bring this point to the notice of the PrimeMinister in the discussions at the Three-Power Meeting.(5) Took note of CP. (45) 75.3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (45) 64) to which wereappended proposals for the political clauses of a possible peace treaty with Italy. This draft had been prepared with a view toits communication first to the Dominions, and then to the UnitedStates Government, who had for some time been anxious to terminate the Armistice regime in Italy.The Foreign Secretary said that at the Three-Power Meetingthere would be discussions about Italy, both with the United Statesand with the Soviet delegations. He boped that the Cabinet wouldbe ready to endorse the broad lines proposed in CP. (45) 64 as abasis for those discussions; and, in addition, to agree upon thefollowing outline of our general policy towards Italy :  (a) We should aim at building up Italy into a useful memberof the European comity of nations, and should lead her to look tothe west rather than to the east. To this end she should be encouraged to provide herself with a Government elected on western democratic principles.(&amp;) Such a policy being as much in the interests of the UnitedStates as of the United Kingdom, we should do all we could toencourage continuing American interest in Italy. We should notmind their taking the lead, more particularly in economic matters,in which we were less well placed to make a contribution.(c)   To give effect to this policy we would have to help Italypolitically and economically, and might have to undertake some additional obligations in regard to personnel or supplies.-4] , &apos; b 3
To implement such a policy the following steps would bedesirable :- i(i) The conclusion of an early Peace Treaty.(ii) The encouragement of early elections for the ConstituentAssembly, though that might not be possible before next spring.(iii) A decision as regards the number of Allied troops to beretained in Italy. From the political point of view the ForeignOffice would see advantage in retaining Allied troops in Italy, atany rate until after the elections, and thought it desirable to keepthere United States troops as well as British.(iv) The Italian Government should be enabled to maintainarmed forces adequate to preserve internal security and defence against local aggression. We should be ready to assist withmaterial and the training of personnel and, in particular, should aim at the establishment for a limited period of a Military Mission preferably Anglo-American to help to train the Italian Army.(v) A Police Mission should be considered. It was of greatimportance to get the Italian Police reorganised. It might not be easy for us to find the personnel, and there would be some political disadvantages in a British Mission. Perhaps we might thereforeencourage the United States to take the lead in this matter.(vi) We should step up our propaganda in Italy so as to convince the Italians of the advantages of a western democraticway of life. That might mean the provision of more staff for theMinistry of Information.(vii) The sooner arrangements could be made for the repatria-tion of Italian prisoners of war the better.(viii) U.N.R.R.A. should be encouraged to take over supplyresponsibilities for Italy as soon as practicable from the allied commission; and, if S.A.C.M.E.D. concurred, the remainingeconomic functions of the Commission should then be transferredto some other form of Anglo-American advisory machinery.(ix) Italy would continue to need much assistance oversupplies, particularly coal. It was in our interest and that of theUnited States to make every effort to prevent a breakdown. Itwould be desirable to clear this point at the Three-Power Meeting.(x) Our general policy should be gradually to reduce the other activities of the Allied Commission over as wide a field as possible.After discussion the Cabinet *(1) Gave general approval, subject to conclusions (3) and (4)below, to the proposals in CP. (45) 64 and to the state-ment of policy outlined by the Foreign Secretary.(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for the colonies would communicate with the Foreign Secretary on oneor two technical points on the draft Treaty annexed to cp. (45) 64.A discussion followed as regards the repatriation of italian prisoners of war.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that he was most anxious to retain 30,000 prisoners for work in the United kingdom on a wage-earning basis, but for legal reasons arrangements wouldhave to be made which would allow them to retain the technicalstanding of prisoners of war. If the Cabinet approved his proposal in principle, detailed arrangements could be worked out at theofficial level.Attention was drawn to the possible political objections toretaining Italian prisoners of war on a wage-earning basis if thisshould coincide with unemployment in this country. It was pointedout, on the other band, that there was unlikely to be unemploymentin agriculture; and no difficulty should arise so long as we honouredthe &quot;guarantees given to the Trade Unions that prisoners of war would not be employed where British labour was available.The Secretary of State for India said that the Government ofIndia were employing 5,350 Italian officers and men on ship repairs.,and were obtaining 2,750 skilled and some hundreds of unskilled
workers from East Africa and the Middle East. They wouldcertainly want provision made in the Treaty to cover tihe retentionof these men. It was, suggested that the need for ensuring thatItalians should retain the status of prisoners of war would notarise in India, where they could be treated as collaborators, enlistedby their own Government and disciplined by their own officers.After discussion the Cabinet *(3) Agreed that it was desirable to retain some 30,000 italian prisoners of war on a wage-earning basis in agriculture in this country, and invited the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries to arrange for the Departments concerned to consider how these prisoners could be retained withthe technical status of prisoners of war.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for India to consult theGovernment of India on the arrangements to be madefor retaining essential Italian prisoner of war labour inIndia.Consultation The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggested that hewith Dominion should immediately communicate to Dominion Governments theGovernments, text of the draft Peace Treaty appended to CP. (45) 64; inform them that the matter was likely to be raised at the Three-power meeting; that we would avoid entering into detail, or taking any final decisions without further consultation with them, and ask fortheir immediate comment.The Union of South Africa had asked that formal provision should be made for the Three Powers to consult South Africa before any final decision was taken as to the allocation of the italian colonies. This raised a difficult point of general procedure whichwould require further study. He suggested, however, that ifmatters went faster at the forthcoming Conference than was&quot; X &quot; expected, we might meet the point by putting it on record that wewould consult South Africa, on behalf of the Three Powers, as tothe allocation of these territories.The Cabinet-(5) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs should consult Dominion Governments as proposed, and endorsed his suggestion at &quot; X &quot; above regarding thepoint raised by the Union of South Africa.4. The Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the Ministerof Fuel and Power (CP. (45) 60) and the Minister of War Transport(CP. (45) 66) regarding the increased demand for bunker coalarising from the movement in this country of Swedish, norwegian and Danish ships, and also a number of German prize ships, follow-ing the end of the war in Europe.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that arrangements hadbeen made to supply about 70,000 tons of suitable coal for thepurpose of bringing these ships to this country. He estimated thattheir continued bunkering would involve the supply of an additional100,000 tons during July and August, and thereafter an additionalsupply of over 100,000 tons a month. The bulk of the coal required would be large coal of the type used by gas-works, railways and domestic consumers. There was already grave difficulty in meetingexisting requirements for this type of coal; and he saw no meansof meeting these new demands except at the expense of otherconsumers, particularly the railways. He was forced to the conclu-sion that we must consider laying up the majority of these additionalships during July and August in order to reduce the strain on ourrailway coal supplies, and that after August our contribution towards additional bunkering should be limited to 40,000 tons amonth.Coal.(previous reference:CM. (45)8thConclusions,Minute 6.)AdditionalBunkeringRequirements.
The Minister of Fuel and Power stressed the gravity of thecoal situation in this country. The stocks held by railway companies and gas-works were well below the minimum safety levels, and there seemed little prospect of building them up before the beginning ofthe winter. There was no possibility of any further cut in supplies for the domestic consumer. &quot;While, therefore, he was anxious to do everything he could to help the Minister of War Transport, he could see no means of meeting in full the bunkering needs of these additional ships.The Minister of War Transport said that in his view thedemands for additional coal for bunkering these ships were not likely to be as high as the estimates given by the Minister of fuel and Power. Moreover,, the requirement would not be wholly for large coal; a high proportion of small coal or washed slack coalcould be supplied for use by these ships. He must, however, press that some solution should be sought which would not involve layingup this additional shipping. In present circumstances it was surelyunthinkable, both from our own point of view and from that ofthe United Nations as a whole, that we should fail, for lack ofcoal, to use the additional ships which had become available to us as a result of the end of the war in Europe.It was the view of the Cabinet that, while this additional coal should not be found at the expense of British railways, every possible means of supplying the coal required should be explored before itwas decided to lay up any of these additional ships. The issues involved were complex and detailed, and they should be the subjectof a special enquiry by a small Cabinet Committee, whose recom-mendations should be drawn up in time for them to be considered at the Three Power Meeting.The Cabinet (1) Appointed a Committee consisting of President of the Board of Trade and Minister ofProduction (in the Chair),Minister of Labour and National Service,Minister of Fuel and Power,A representative of the Minister of War Transport,to consider the issues raised in CP. (45) 60 and 66, andto submit their recommendations to the Cabinet withina week&apos;s time.(2) Agreed that the Cabinet&apos;s views on the Report of thisCommittee should be communicated to the PrimeMinister in time for him to take the matter up with president Truman in the course of the discussions atthe Three Power Meeting.5. The Cabinet had before them a telegram (No. 191 SC, datedthe 11th July) from the Viceroy reporting the latest developments in his discussions with the Indian political parties. He had nowcommunicated on the lines approved by the Cabinet at their meetingon the 9th July with Jinnah, who had, however, refused to co-operateunless (a) all Muslim members of the Executive Council were drawn from the Muslim League; and (b) the Governor-GeneraFs veto wasreinforced by a special safeguard, e.q., that no decision objected toby the Muslims should be taken in Council except by a clear two-thirds majority or some similar provision. The Viceroy had informed Jinnah that he was unable to accept either of theseconditions, and had added that he would explain the position to theConference on the 14th July. He had thereafter seen Gandhi; had explained matters to him and had asked him to use his influence to reduce communal recrimination over the failure of the proposals.He had not disclosed his own complete list to either Gandhi orJinnah.India.constitutional position.(previous reference:CM. (45) 13thConclusions,Minute 9.)
Ceylon.(previous reference:W.M.(44)77thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (45) 73) stating that hehad now received the Report of the Commission under the Chair-manship of Lord Soulbury which had been studying the questionof constitutional reform in Ceylon.The Secretary af State for the Colonies said thatMr. Senanayake, the Leader of the State Council in Ceylon, would shortly be arriving in this country for discussions with him; and,while final decisions on the recommendations in the Commission^Report would have to be taken by the Cabinet itself, it would beof assistance if a Cabinet Committee could be appointed at onceso that he might have the views of interested Ministers on someof the questions which he would have to discuss with,Mr. Senanayake.The Viceroy now proposed to see the other two leaders (Khizarand Azad); to tell them the communal and party composition of the list, and to say that the Muslim League had felt unable to accept it.He would take the same line at the Conference and would make ashort Press statement instead of a broadcast. He would not expressany opinion on future possibilities, but would say that he must take time to consider the position. He would in due course reportagain to the Cabinet on the matters mentioned in paragraph 6 ofhis telegram after considering the political reactions to the break-down and consulting with Governors. His own judgment of theposition was that we had been close to success and that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had for the moment gained, rather than lost, ground.The Cabinet agreed that there was no alternative but to recog-nise that the Viceroy&apos;s strenuous efforts to reach a settlement had failed, and that the breakdown must, be acknowledged publicly,though without recrimination.The following points were made in discussion (a) The Viceroy&apos;s action in communicating with Gandhi,Khizar and Azad before reporting back to the Cabinet was not wholly consistent with the message which the Cabinet had sent him.It was suggested, on the other hand, that if Lord Wavell proposedto say no more to Khizar and Azad than he had to Gandhi, viz.,to tell them of the communal and party composition of the list and ask them to use their influence to reduce communal and partyrecrimination over the failure, no great harm had been done.(6) It was of first importance that the course of events leading to the breakdown of the discussions should be clearly presented tothe public in this country and abroad. The Viceroy proposed tomake a statement to the Press. It was desirable that a simultaneousstatement should be made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.In these circumstances the Cabinet felt that the Viceroy shouldbe asked to telegraph the text of the statement which he proposed tomake; that he should be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould themselves issue a statement, and that he should be given anopportunity of commenting on its terms.(c) It would be desirable, in replying to the Viceroy, to assurehim that all possible steps would be taken to prevent any leakagein this country of his proposed list of names.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of Statefor India, on behalf of the India Committee, to settle inthe light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, subject to theapproval of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,terms of (i) a reply to the Viceroy&apos;s telegram; and(ii) a statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government, which wouldbe communicated to the Viceroy for comment before being issued to the Press in this country.
The Cabinets-Appointed a Committee consisting of Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman),President of the Board of Trade and Minister ofProduction.Secretary of State for India, .....Secretary of State for the Colonies,First Lord of the Admiralty,Secretary of State for War,Secretary of State for Air,to consider and report to the Cabinet on the recommenda-tions contained in the Report of the Soulbury Commission.Cabinet Office,12th July, 1945.
