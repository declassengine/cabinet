1.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda : (i) CP. (45) 50 and CP. (45) 87 by the Home Secretaryproposing the relaxation of restrictions on the departure of British subjects for overseas destinations; and(ii) CP. (45) 71 by the Secretary of State for India dealing withthe effect of the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals on thesecurity examination and control of British subjectsproposing to visit India.The Home Secretary recalled that during the war it had been laid down that a person should be allowed to travel overseas only if he could establish (i) that his home was overseas, (ii) that hisjourney was in the national interest, or (iii) that there were urgentcompassionate grounds for the journey. With the conclusion ofhostilities in Europe the position had changed and the maintenanceof restrictions on the freedom of movement of British subjectscould no longer be justified except on the grounds of man-power orsecurity. So far as man-power was concerned, the Ministry ofLabour and National Service would be satisfied if the departure of men and women between the ages of 18 and 30 were controlled;and with regard to security it was felt that it would be sufficient toretain a security check on journeys to countries with whichcommunications were still subject to censorship. The Secretary ofState for India in his memorandum (CP. (45) 71) had suggestedthat the security check should also be retained for India (and for burma so far as it was possible for travellers to proceed there),even though communications to India were not subject to censorship,and he proposed to agree to this modification of his proposals. the relaxation of restrictions would mean increased competition forthe limited number of passages available and it would be necessaryto set up a Priority Passage Board to allocate passages on shippingcontrolled by the Government to applicants sponsored by Govern-ment Departments and to a small number of urgent compassionatecases, with provision for a small residue to be disposed of by shipping and air line companies. With regard to procedure, ithad been found that the Passport and Permit Office would have great difficulty in coping with a large number of additional applica-tions for exit permits and in CP. (45) 87 he had accordingly suggested that, instead of an exit permit being endorsed on each,passport, reliance should be placed on the validation of the passportitself for specified destinations as a sign that departure for thosedestinations had been duly authorised. This would make itnecessary to withhold passports to British subjects within the age groups of 18 to 30, subject to any authorised exceptions, and toabandon the practice whereby passports had been given a BritishEmpire endorsement as a matter of course. A warning would also have to be given to holders of passports issued before the appointeddate and endorsed as valid for the British Empire, that a newendorsement by the Passport and Permit Office would be requiredfor travel to India. The representatives of the Dominions and of eire in London, who were authorised to issue passports wouldrequire to come into line with the proposed new practice and there might be some difficulty in persuading the representative of Eireto conform. He hoped, however, that this difficulty would not be insuperable.In discussion it was pointed out that the proposed relaxationwould inevitably give rise to demands that the dependants ofmembers of the Forces serving overseas should be allowed to jointhem, and for this reason the War Office would have preferred thepresent restrictions to be retained. If, however, there were ;to bea relaxation it seemed desirable that the scope and method of operations of the Priority Passage Board proposed in para-graph 14 (&amp;) of CP. (45) 50 should be discussed inter-departmentallyin order to ensure the maximum fairness in the allocation ofpassages. In this connection doubts were expressed as to the wisdom of leaving any residue of passages to be disposed of by shipping
and air-line companies and special attention was drawn to theclaims of dependants of employees in Admiralty dockyards overseas,and of officers in the Colonial Service for priority in the allocation of passages. At the same time stress was laid on the importanceof ensuring that the operation of the Priority Passage Board shouldnot be unnecessarily rigid.Other points in discussion were (a) The Minister of State drew attention to the staffingdifficulties to be anticipated, but undertook to consider what couldbe done by administrative means to ensure that the Passport andPermit Office could cope with the increased volume of work.(b) The relaxation of restrictions would lead to an increased demand for exchange facilities which, within reason, would haveto be met. For this purpose new arrangements would have to bemade with the banks and these would have to permit of a certainamount of latitude.* (c) It was explained that for the purpose of the security check the criterion to be applied was whether a censorship of communica-tions leaving this country was still maintained. Thus the checkwould not apply to journeys to France although there was still acensorship of communications entering France.(d) The Home Secretary undertook to see whether the existing practice under which any application for an exit permit for alienshad to be sponsored by the Minister of the Department concernedhimself could be abandoned.(e) It was agreed that any approach to the representatives ofthe Dominions and of Eire in London on the question of the issueof passports should be made in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs.(/) The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed out thatin certain colonies it was still necessary to maintain a system of entry permits. These colonies, like India, would have to be exceptedfrom the general relaxation.The Cabinet-(1) Gave general approval to the proposals made by the HomeSecretary for the relaxation of restrictions on the departure of British subjects for overseas destinations,subject to any modifications necessary to meet the points raised by the Secretary of State for India and theSecretary of State for the Colonies.(2) Invited the Minister of War Transport to arrange for theprinciples on which the Priority Passage Board would operate in allocating travel facilities to be considered inconsultation with the Departments concerned in the lightof the points made in discussion.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forconsideration by the Departments concerned of theconditions on which travel facilities should be granted todependants of members of the Forces and Civil Servantsstationed overseas.(4) While recording their view that an early decision was desirable, agreed that pending settlement of the points referred to in (2) and (3) above no announcement shouldbe made of the proposed relaxation.India.Azad&apos;sStatementsthe Press.(previous reference:C.M.(45)15thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. At their meeting on the 18th July the Cabinet had acceptedthe Viceroy&apos;s view that failing any repetition of Maulana Azad&apos;sto mis-statements about his conversations with Lord Wavell (in which case the Viceroy would write to him) things should be left as theywere. They had, however, invited Lord Wavell to consider theI desirability of circulating confidentially to those concerned the record of the proceedings at the first meeting of the Simla Confer-ence, at which the Viceroy had explained the attitude of His[30622-3]b 2
Majesty&apos;s Government on the matters in question, which had notbeen contested by. Azad. .They now had before them Lord Wavell&apos;s telegram of the20th July, No. 1179-S. The Viceroy explained that he had at thetime decided against maintaining and circulating a record of theproceedings of the Conference in view of the probable difficulty ofsecuring agreed corrections, and had so informed the Conference,which had agreed. To circulate in these circumstances an editedversion of the confidential notes that had been kept would occasionsurprise, and lead to controversy. He would prefer, therefore, to let the matter rest for the moment, and, if later compelled to dealwith it, to do so on the basis of the notes of the interview andConference, to which he could legitimately refer in correspondence with Azad and others.The Secretary of State for India said that information receivedfrom India did not suggest that there had been any disposition inthe Indian press to follow up Azad&apos;s mis-statements. If, at a later stage, there were to be further discussions or those mis-stratementswere repeated, the Viceroy was in a position to deal with them. Hisown view was that there was no case for any further action at themoment.After discussion the Cabinet agreed that no further action could usefully be taken at this stage.Industrial 3.   The Minister of Labour and National Service said that the disputes. Cabinet would desire to know the latest developments in the bus(Previous and dock strikes and the &quot; go slow &quot; movement at the London Docks.Reference:       The widespread Midlands bus strike had now been settled exceptW.M.(44)43rd   in Worcester and he hoped that the dock strikes at Cardiff and.Conclusions,      Swansea would soon come to an end. With regard to the &quot; go slow &quot;Minute 7.)       movement, he had been able to bring together the London port employers and the trade union leaders, with the result that theyhad reached agreement on the terms of a settlement.  These termshad, however, been rejected at a mass meeting of the men themselves and the &quot;go slow&quot; movement continued, conditions being par-ticularly bad in the Surrey Commercial Dock.The position of workers who were acting in defiance of their leaders was strengthened by the fact that under the existing income-tax law they were entitled, during periods when they were on strike or in receipt of low wages, to the refund of part of the income taxwhich they had paid while they had been in receipt of full wages;and the repayments sometimes amounted to as much as  2 10s. or 3 a week.Where troops were employed to unload essential cargoes theywould be unarmed and care would be taken to avoid employingthem in such a way as to lead to conflict with the workers. It was clear that the trade union leaders would not Object to the use oftroops for the unloading of food and other perishables. There wasno evidence of any political motives behind the strikes or the &quot; goslow &quot; movement and the Ministry of Labour, whose conciliation machinery was working well, had throughout been able to maintainthe initiative. In general the position was not unduly disturbingand he hoped that means of re-establishing the authority of thetrade union leaders in the London dispute would be found very shortly.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was no doubtthat if a worker&apos;s earnings ceased because he was on strike ordiminished because he took part in a &quot; go slow &quot; movement, he was^in law entitled to a refund of income tax; and it would be verydifficult to devise any amendment of the law which would not involvethe Government in taking sides in industrial disputes. Some mitiga-tion of the unfortunate effect of the law.could, however, be securedif employers availed themselves of the provision in the regulations made in March 1945 under the Income Tax (Employments) Act,-
1943, which enabled an employer, instead of repaying the taxhimself, to notify the Inspector of Taxes, whereupon the liability tomake repayments was transferred from the employer to the InlandRevenue. He undertook to find out why the London Port employers were not taking advantage of this provision.On the general question he drew attention to the fact that industrial disputes in the docks were bound to prejudice our positionin negotiations with foreign countries with regard to food supplies.The action of the dock workers also raised the question whether theheavy expenditure incurred by the Exchequer through the national dock Labour Corporation in decasualising dock labour and in providing welfare facilities had been justified.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement made by the Minister of Labourand National Service and invited him to keep theminformed of any further developments.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th July, 1945.
