India. 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by(Previous the Secretary of State for India, on the action to be taken, ifReference: necessary, against the Indian National Congress (W.P. (42) 340).W.m: (42) 99th The War Cabinet also had before them copies of three further conclusions.) telegrams (Nos. 2284S, 2285S and 2289S) containing:-(i) A summary of a circular from the Andhra ProvincialCongress Party;.and(ii) A report from the Governor of Bombay of the effect ofPateFs visit to Ahmedabad and Gujerat.The Secretary of State for India said that the Viceroy, whohad throughout acted in full accord with his Council, had adoptedan extremely patient attitude, in the hope that Congress might think better of the course of action they proposed. . His wholeCouncil, however, had decided that if Congress forced the issue,stern and swift action must be taken. Evidence was nowaccumulating that Gandhi and those associated with him meantreal mischief. He asked the War Cabinet to authorise him to telegraph to the Viceroy to the effect that the course of action proposed in telegram 6092 (a copy of which was annexed toW.P. (42) 340) was approved, and should be adopted if Congresspassed a resolution which called for .mass disobedience all overIndia. *The All-India Congress Committee was to meet oh the7th August. It was therefore likely that the resolutionrecommended by the Working Committee would be endorsed intwo or, more probably, three days&apos; time.The following were the main points dealt with in discussion : (i) The suggestion in paragraph 10 of telegram 6092 that,if Gandhi fasted, t and mouse &quot; procedure wasto be followed, was strongly criticised.Doubts were expressed as to whether the machineat the disposal of the Government of India would stand the strain which would be involved if Gandhihunger-struck while detained in India. From thispoint of view it was essential that Gandhi should begot out of the country.(ii) The War Cabinet were informed that the Viceroy had given careful consideration to the proposal that Gandhishould be deported, and had consulted the Provincial- - Governors.   The Viceroy had reported that, while twoof the Governors favoured deportation, most of them,......v    ; and his own (the Viceroy&apos;s) advisers, were against...      . this, course.The view taken by the War Cabinet was that thiswas a matter in which His Majesty&apos;s Government mustbe responsible for the decision taken.(iii) Discussion ensued as to the places to which- Gandhicould be deported. For a man of his physique and age,a sea voyage would be preferable to a journey by air.It was also agreed that it was very important that heshould be taken out of India the moment he wasdetained.....The War Cabinet concluded that the right course was that he should be taken at once to Aden.   This- would allow time for further consideration to be givento his ultimate destination. &apos;(iv)The question then arose whether other leaders who weredetained should also be taken out of India. On this,the view taken was that one issue of prime importance was to avoid a situation in which Gandhi was onhunger-strike in India. No doubt other congress leaders detained would be less likely to hunger-strike
if Gandhi was not in India. The determining factorwas, however, that the importance of Gandhi&apos;position should not be emphasised by deporting him and him only from India. It would therefore bedesirable that half a dozen or a dozen of the other leaders should be deported. East Africa seemed to bethe best place.(v) Comment was made on some of the terms used in telegram * 6092, e.g., the words &quot;arrest&quot; and&quot;detention in jails.&quot; It was important to avoid anywords suggesting criminal imprisonment and to makeit clear that the persons in question were being internedand treated as detenus.The Conclusions of the War Cabinet were as follows: (1) Approval was given, subject to the modifications setout below, to the action which the Government of Indiaproposed to take against Congress (as outlined in telegramNo. 6092 from the Government of India Home Departmentdated the 3rd August) in the event of the resolution of the14th July being endorsed by the All-India Congress committee or some similar resolution being passed which included a CivilDisobedience Campaign, or overt action being initiated on similar lines.The modifications in question were as follows: (a) The War Cabinet could not agree that the &quot;cat andmouse &quot; procedure should be adopted if Gandhi shouldhunger-strike while under detention. It should be clearly understood that, once he had been taken underrestraint, he must be kept in detention, even though he went on hunger-strike. In view of the difficulties towhich his detention in India, while hunger-striking,was likely to give rise, the War Cabinet were strongly of opinion that, as soon as he had been taken underrestraint, he should be removed forthwith by sea tosome place outside India.(6) Aden was suggested as the first destination. Subsequently,he might be transferred to some more suitable place for continued detention possibly the Sudan.(c) Arrangements should be made for him to be accompanied,riot only by medical attendants, but also by a responsibleofficer who could take decisions on behalf of theGovernment of India in an eiriergency.(d) To avoid giving the impression that Gandhi was beingselected for special treatment, some dozen or half-dozenof the other leaders who were to be detained shouldbetaken to East Africa by air.(e) In announcing the decision to detain these leaders, and generally in regard to the action taken, care shouldbe taken to avoid the use of words suggesting criminalimprisonment. It should be made clear that the leaders were being treated as detenus.(2) In announcing the action taken against the congress leaders prominence should be given to the following points: (a) This action had the full support of the members of theViceroy&apos;s Executive Council.(&amp;) The resolution of the Congress Working Committee wasonly the beginning of a far-reaching scheme designedwholly to undermine India&apos;s co-operation in the war effort. The documentary evidence in support of thisshould be made public (e.g., telegram 2285 from the, Viceroy dated the 4th August)&apos;.[24209] b 2
(c) Our action was taken in the interests of the united nations as a whole, not merely for the protection ofBritish interests in India.(3) The. Foreign Secretary should communicate to thePresident of the United States, in advance, full particulars of the course of action which it was proposed to take againstthe Congress leaders. The Secretary of State for theDominions should also inform the Dominion Prime ministers of the course proposed. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in China should also be informed of the plan, but should be instructednot to disclose it to General Chiang Kai-shek until afterGandhi and the other Congress leaders had been detained.India.War financial settlement of1940 and IndianSterlingBalances.2. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (42)325) and the Secretary ofState for India (W.P. (42) 328).The Settlement of 1940 provided that India should recover from Great Britain all her defence expenditure except her normalpre-war budget (adjusted for rises in prices), the cost of measures taken in India for India&apos;s local defence, and a share of the cost of measures &quot; taken jointly in the interests of Indian defence and ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot; If the Settlement remained unaltered,India would have accumulated, by the end of the war, sterling balances amounting to several hundreds of millions of poundswhich, while they would be of no benefit to India during the war,would present a grave handicap to Britain after the war.The Chancellor of the Exchequer urged that, in the light ofthe principle of &apos;&apos; Reciprocal Aid&apos;&apos; enunciated by president roosevelt and of the changed situation resulting fromthe spread of the war to India&apos;s frontiers, the Financial Settlement of April1940 ought to be revised and that, in future, the United kingdom should supply without charge whatever cost sterling, and that india should supply without charge whatever cost rupees.The Secretary of State for India contested the Chancellorscase for revision of the Settlement. The amount of contributionto be expected from each of the United Nations in accordance withthe principle of &quot; Reciprocal Aid &quot; clearly had to be in proportion to its National income, and India was a poor country with arapidly increasing defence budget of her own. Further, a largeproportion of the rupee war expenditure recoverable by India underthe 1940 Settlement was incurred by the Government of Indiaacting as agent for the United Kingdom Government and bore no direct relation to the defence of India. The Government of india were ready to assume further limited financial burdens within the framework of the 1940 Settlement and to discuss with&quot; the UnitedKingdom Government mutually satisfactory methods of mitigatingany inconvenience through the accumulation of sterling balances,provided it was made clear that there was no intention radically to revise the 1940 Settlement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Prime Ministertook a great interest in this subject; he would therefore prefer thatthe matter should be dealt with at a meeting at which the PrimeMinister could be present. He had felt, however, that the WarCabinet ought to take the opportunity of hearing the views ofSir Jeremy Raisman, the Finance Member of the Viceroy&apos; executive Council, who was shortly returning to India.The Chancellor of the Exchequer indicated that a decision might haye to be reached between two views : The first was thatthe situation had been so changed by the course of the war that the
195 W.M. 105 (42).Settlement of 1940 should now be, revised. The second was thatwhile the existing Settlement should be continued, some measures should be taken within the limits of that Settlement to mitigate-the difficult, and perhaps dangerous, position which would ariseafter the war. He cited, as examples, that it did not seem right that the incidence of expenditure of troops should vary accordingto which side of the Indian and Burma Frontier they were on.Again, India should be pressed to pay for the aircraft sent to her.[Sir Jeremy Raisman then entered the meeting.]Sir Jeremy Raisman said that IndiaVwar effort included theprovision of men and materials hot only for the defence of India,but for the war generally. Under the existing Settlement India&apos;defence expenditure was already four or five times greater than before the war. But, as a result of the payments which India was receiving in sterling for goods and materials used outside India,she was accumulating large sterling balances. The Treasury took the view that these large sterling balances would give rise to aserious post-war situation, and that the 1940 Settlement ought,therefore, to be revised. India&apos;s reply was that no feasiblealteration in the 1940 Settlement could prevent these sterling balances from being built up, and that other measures must beconsidered for mitigating the post-War situation. These measuresmust, moreover, take a form which would not alienate the com-mercial classes, which had hitherto co-operated well in the war effort. If India neither received payment nor was entitled to claimcompensation in respect of goods and services used outside India,the co-operation of the commercial classes would cease.It was also clear that those who held moderate views in india could not be got to accept the point of view put forward by theTreasury, and that no good could come of attempting to get thisview accepted.Sir Jeremy said that he had had discussions with the treasury on defence expenditure and had gone so far as he properly could,within the limits of the existing Settlement, in accepting liabilitieson India&apos;s defence budget. It should be recognised, however, that india?s increased war expenditure had created a very difficult problem, which would have to be met by taxation and borrowing ona scale hitherto unknown in India. Moreover, if anything was done to alienate the commercial classes, it would be impossible to raisethe sums required by borrowing, and an inflationary position wouldresult. There would be the danger of a flight from currency intogoods, which would result in hoarding. This in turn might giverise to famines and riots.Sir Jeremy said that he hoped to be able to justify the large increase in defence expenditure under the existing Settlementbecause the people of India had seen the large- increase in thefighting services in the country and also the flow of munitions, &amp;c,sent to defend the country.Sir Jeremy Raisman then dealt with the measures which hethought could be taken to mitigate the consequences of India&apos;sgrowing sterling balances at the end of the war.First, it was contemplated to set aside a reconstruction fund which would be used, under control, for the importation into india of capital and consumer goods, in accordance with a recognisedprogramme. &apos; ,In the second place, he was prepared to discuss the capitahsa-tion of India&apos;s sterling pension liabilities, India handing over tothe Treasury a capital sum in sterling in exchange for annual sums,calculated to meet India&apos;s pension payments as they accrued.There was also still some  50 or  60 millions of debt to be repatriated. &apos;&apos; .      ,.Thirdly, it would be necessary to keep a large sum of sterlingas a backing for the currency.
These measures taken together should suffice to dispose of ourembarrassment at the sterling balances at present ip view.Another measure which the Indian Government were preparedto consider was an alteration in the law which would pnable theReserve Bank to hold sterling investments of a maturity exceedingfive years.Sir Jeremy was asked whether India could not pay for theaircraft now being sent to India- He said that the present arrangement was that, in regard to defence expenditure undertaken in the.joint interests of India and the United Nations, India paid for items provided by India from local resources, while the UnitedKingdom and the United States paid for what they themselves had provided. This arrangement was so well and widely understood inIndia that a change would be regarded as a fundamental departure from the existing settlement. There would also be grave adminis-trative inconvenience in departing from this system, since it wouldinvolve a costing of services received and rendered. In Sir Jeremy&apos;view, any possibility that might have existed of asking India toaccept a larger defence liability had been finally dispelled by japan &apos;s entry into the war, which had already caused a heavyincrease in India&apos;s owp expenditure.The War Cabinet thanked Sir Jeremy Raisman for his state-ment, and he then withdrew.The War Cabinet decided to take note of the views expressed,but to record no decision, further discussion being adjourned to ameeting when the Prime Minister could be present.Great George Street, S.W. 1,August 6, 1942.
