The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thelast week.From an air point of view, the Dieppe Raid had achievedcomplete surprise. It had been three hours after the attack had started before German fighters, and six hours before Germanbombers, had appeared on the scene. The final figures of enemy losses had been 96 destroyed, 40 probably and 140 damaged. our losses had been 107 aircraft (37 pilots safe). A third of our losses had occurred in giving close support to our ground forces.Osnabruck, Flensburg and Frankfurt had been bombed duringthe previous week.United States bombers had started day operations with verypromising results.Coastal Command had made twelve attacks on submarines, twoof which had been promising. Two merchant ships and an enemytanker had also been hit. One submarine had been sunk by UnitedStates forces.During the previous eight days enemy losses, including theDieppe raid, amounted to 116 certain, 60 probable, 166 damaged.Our losses amounted to 115 fighters, 12 Army Co-operation aircraft,.37 bombers and 9 Coastal Command aircraft.No bombs had been dropped on Malta during the previous week.There had been little activity by day. Tobruk had been bombedat night. Four big ships and 10 small ones (of which 2 had been sunk) had been claimed as hit. .:Merchant shipping losses during the past week ending theprevious day amounted to 161,000 tons. This figure included anumber of ships overdue and belated reports of losses.Military In the Leningrad and Voronezh sector the Russians had madeOperations. local attacks, but the Germans still held Voronezh itself, togetherRussia. with a bridgehead.  In the Stalingrad sector the Germans claimed to have reached the Don everywhere in. the bend. North-west of stalingrad the Germans had crossed the river in considerable forcenear Ostrovoska. Heavy fighting had taken place in this area andalso at Tundutova, south of Stalingrad. The Russian General staff had stated on the 17th August that the situation in this sector wasin hand, but it would seem to have deteriorated recently.
2. The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet an account ofthe main impressions which he had formed during his visit to theMiddle East and to Moscow.A record of the discussion. is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Air Services. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them the following memo-Middle East.     randa on the deficiencies in the air service to the Middle East: (Previous Report of an ad hoc Committee appointed by the War CabinetEeference: (W.P. (42) 275).W.M. (41) l08tb Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (42) 315).Conclusions, Memorandum by the Postmaster-General (W.P. (42) 329).Minute 10). Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (W.P. (42) 367).The main points made in these memoranda were : (1) Although the average weekly load carried by air to theMiddle East had risen from 4,700 lbs. in November 1941to 15,020 lbs. in June 1942, the increase in the weight ofair mails carried had not been proportionate and was more than offset by the expansion of the British Forcesin the Middle East.(2) The Postmaster-General, in &quot;response to representations made by the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, was anxious to introduce a light-weight air-mail letterservice in place of the present thin-postcard service. Hecould not, however, introduce this new service until hewas assured of an increased allocation of space formails.(3) The Secretary of State for War supported the proposal fora light-weight air-mail letter service to the troops, and pointed out that, in addition to this, the War Officeweekly requirements for urgent passengers and freighthad now risen from 5,000 to 10,000 lbs.In discussion, the Secretary of State for Air said that theexpansion of load-carrying capacity on this route was now ahead of the schedule laid down in March 1942. The forecast then made- was for an average weekly load of 14,000 lbs. by the end of August1942, but in fact the average weekly load carried during recent weeks had been 16,500 lbs. He recognised, however, the need forstill greater capacity, and he had been reviewing the possibilitiesof increasing further the number of aircraft available for this service. He now proposed that one Sunderland should be allocated to this service, out of current production, in each of the six months from October 1942; and that a total of 10-12 Warwicks shouldalso be provided over the next few months, at the expense of bomber command, beginning with two in September. These additionalproposals would have the result of increasing the carrying capacityon this route by 10,000 lbs. a week by the end of 1942.Tbe PrimeMinister.Visit to theMiddle Eastand Moscow.In the Caucasus the German advance was in three main areas :(i) on the Kuma River, where they had reached a point about100 miles from the * Caspian Sea; (ii) along the Rostov-BakuRailway, where they had reached a point some 70 miles fromGrosny; and (iii) near the Elbruz mountains. The enemy was alsowithin 15 miles of Novorossisk. The Russians, however, seemedconfident that they would be able to hold the situation in theSouthern Caucasus.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
The Postmaster-General said that past experience showed thatan increase in load-carrying capacity would not necessarily meanan increased allocation of space for mails. He emphasised the needfor an air-mail letter service in wder to meet %he growing demandfor rapid Communication by sealed letter. This new-service couldnot be started until he could rely upon a definite weekly allocationfor mails of 6,000 lbs. -Moreover, the volume of trafficby airgraphand thin postcards had increased from a figure of &amp;&amp;0 lbs. a week in February to over 3,100 lbs. a week in August. In consequence,a considerable proportion of the volume of traffic on these two existing services now had to be sent by sea.The Prime Minister said that there were strong military reasons for providing an adequate air-mail service for our troops inthe Middle East. It was essential that the morale of the troops should be maintained, and the War Cabinet should recognise theextent to which they depended on letters from home. He alsostressed the need for improving the supply of books and periodicalsfor the troops in this theatre. In his view, Bomber Command and coastal Command should provide (in the proportions 3: 2)the additional aircraft necessary to ensure a total weekly allocation of 6,000 lbs. for mails for the Services On this route.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Air, in consultation withthe First Lord of the Admiralty, to submit a scheme for providing the additional aircraft required to enable a firm allocation of 6;000 lbs. a week to be made, as fromthe end of September 1942, for the carriage of mails for troops in the Middle East. It should be explained whatdiversion from other air services would thereby be involved.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to submit proposalsfor increasing the supply of books and periodicals forthe troops in this theatre. .Great George Street, S.W.1,August 25, 1%12.
