Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 91stConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Malta.Egypt.naval operations.Malta.Military-Operations.Egypt.Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.Weather had limited the operations of Bomber Command.By day successful attacks had been made on the Submarine yards at lubeck , and on Essen and Emden, Power stations in northern france had also been attacked. By night our bombers had attacked,targets at Duisburg and Vegesack.Coastal Command had made five attacks on U-boats, one being claimed sunk.Fighter Command had successfully attacked a number of ground targets in Northern France.Total enemy losses for the week amounted to 8 machines forcertain, 5 probable and 18 damaged. We had lost 14 fighters(4 pilots safe), 18 bombers and 3 Coastal Command aircraft.The scale of attack on Malta had declined during the previous-week. The enemy had lost 14 machines for certain, 6 probableand 22 damaged. Our losses amounted to 6 machines destroyed(3 on the ground) and 17 damaged.Air activity had again been on a considerable scale. our bombers had inflicted great damage especially at Tobruk andBenghazi. Two ships had been sunk and 7 hit. Enemy losses amounted to 38 machines for certain, 20 probable and 44 damaged.Our losses amounted to 37 machines destroyed and 10 damaged.Some 300 tons of special stores had been successfully landed in Malta.Four enemy submarines had been sunk by our naval forces,and one by the Americans, during the previous 10 days.An enemy tanker, although strongly escorted, had been sunk by an M.T.B, in the Channel.Allied shipping losses in the previous seven davs amountedto 156,000 tons.During the previous week&apos;s operations our forces had con-tinued to exert strong pressure on the enemy. There had been little change in the line now held except on the southern flankwhere we had advanced westwards. Some 4,000 prisoners, mainlyItalian, had been taken and some 23 German tanks destroyed,and 44 guns captured. The morale of the Italian troops had deteriorated, and their formations had been stiffened with german troops.% In Finland two further German divisions had been identified.This might indicate an impending enemy offensive. In the centralsector the Germans claimed 40,000 prisoners south-west of Rshev.The Russians admitted a withdrawal in this area. At Voronezhthe Russians had attacked north-west of the town and in the townitself. Further south the German thrusts seemed to have beenhalted at Boguchar. On the lower Don front, German armour hadbeen directed towards the Lower Don and the Donets. TheGermans claimed to have reached the Don.The reports received from our Mission in Moscow were onthe whole cheerful, though, with the meagre information given us by the Russians, it was difficult to form a reliable appreciation ofthe situation. It would seem that since the 15th July the situation had worsened and that Russian forces on the Donets-Rostov Frontwere in danger of encirclement.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.[24132]
The shipping situation.(previous reference erence:     .W.M. (42) 81stConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Prime Minister said that he proposed that the WarCabinet and the Ministers concerned should hold a meeting inthe near future to discuss the Shipping Situation in all its bearings.He hoped that it would be possible to arrange with the UnitedStates authorities for them to hand over to us, in replacement ofour losses, as many new ships as we could man! Moreover, it was important to obtain firm assurances about the tonnage to be madeavailable to us during 1943, before we agreed to further cuts inour imports or depletion of our stocks.*The War Cabinet took note of this statement.France.Relations withthe ViehyGovernment.The french fleet at alexandria.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 90thConclusions,Minute 2.)Middle East.ProposedMeasure of evacuation ofCivil PopulationfromAlexandria.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 83rdConclusions,Minute 6.)3.   The War Cabinet had a further discussion on this matter,which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet&apos;Conclusions.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to atelegram from Sir Miles Lampson (No. 1833) putting forward proposals for the immediate&apos; thinning out of the civil populationof Alexandria at the expense of His Majesty&apos;s Government, andfor the preparation of a more thorough scheme of evacuation, tobe carried out, partly at the expense of the Egyptian Government,should the need arise.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary, subject to any views which the Chiefs of Staff might have to offer, to telegraph to Sir Miles Lampson informing him that, in HisMajesty&apos;s Governments view, it would.be undesirable toproceed with measures of the kind proposed at thepresent time, and that, unless there was some strongreason of which His Majesty&apos;s Government were unaware,the scheme should not be proceeded with.Egypt.Conscription ofBritishSubjects.5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a joint memorandum by the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor War (W.P. (42) 303) recommending that powers should, be takento enable British civilians in Egypt to be conscripted for militaryservice or directed to perform part-time duties in civil defence.After reviewing alternative means of securing the necessary powers, the Memorandum recommended that (a) A Bill should be introduced, at once to enable HisMajesty&apos;s Government to. extend the National service acts by Order-in-Council to British subjects resident in foreign countries. The actual procedure for callingmen up would be modified by the Orders-in-Council as might be required, but the individual would retain thestatutory rights, in respect of conscientious objectionand hardship, conceded under the National Service-Acts.
Middle East. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theEvacuation of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 299) regardingWar Refugees, the dangers arising from the accumulation of,war refugees, chieflyPoles and Greeks, in the Middle East. The Minister of state had represented that the authorities in all the possible areas ofreception should be pressed to receive substantial numbers of these refugees; and the Foreign Secretary invited the views.of the WarCabinet on the following specific proposals :-(i) That the South African Government should be asked to accommodate up to 50,000 refugees, chiefly women andchildren;(ii) That the East African Colonies and Northern and southern Rhodesia should be asked to accept a totalof 30,000 refugees; and(iii) That Canada should be asked to take a share of the refugees who (if the United States Government-responded favourably to the recommendations of theirMinister in Cairo) would be shipped in United Statesvessels returning to America.In discussion the following points were raised: (a) The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the commitments already accepted by the Colonies were substantially greater than would appear from theForeign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum. The East african territories had already found, or promised, accom-modation for more than 88,000 refugees (includingprisoners of war). The problem of finding both food and accommodation must limit the extent to which. their existing commitments could be increased. Duringthe next three months they could not accept refugeesat a higher rate than that to which they were alreadycommittedand from mid-October onwards it was unlikely that they would be able to absorb additionalrefugees at a rate higher than 500-750 a week.(b) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thatthe Union of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia- . . would find similar difficulty in accepting additionalrefugees. While he agreed that they should be askedto play their part, he did not expect that the responsewould be favourable;(c) The Foreign Secretary said that he was prepared to press the United States Government to accept a humber ofthese refugees; and the Minister of War Transportsaid that there would be no difficulty in finding passagesfor substantial numbers in ships returning to theUnited States.(6) As soon as possible after the Bill had become law, anOrder-in-Council under it should be made in respectof Egypt. -(c) The obligation to perform civil defence duties should be imposed on British subjects in Egypt by defence regulation.The War Cabinet :-(1) Approved the recommendations summarised above.(2) Agreed that the Bill should be introduced as soon aspracticable and that, if possible, arrangements shouldbe made for it to be passed into law before the Recess.
The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to- consider, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary, theSecretary of State for the Colonies, the Secretary of Statefor War and the Minister of War Transport, what furtherarrangements could be made for the removal of these refugees from the Middle East.Civil Defence.Carrying of GasMasks by thePublic.(previous reference:W.M. (42) VAstConclusions,Minute 10.)7. The War Cabinet reconsidered, in the light of aMemorandum by the Home Secretary (W.P. (42) 292), the questionof relaxing the existing injunctions to civilians always to carrytheir gas masks.- In discussion it was pointed out that, when this question was last considered on the 16th February, it was thought inappropriateto make any change of policy as His Majesty&apos;s Government were-then about to issue their warning about the possible use of poisongas by the Germans in their Russian campaign. This objectionto any change of policy no longer applied.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the injunctions to civilians always to carrytheir gas masks might now be relaxed, on the conditions set out in the Report annexed to W.P. (42) 76.(2) Asked that this relaxation should be accompanied by atightening up of the precautions to ensure thatrespirators in the hands of the public are kept in good condition.Home Front. 8.   The War Cabinet took note of a Report by the MinisterPublicity policy, of Information (W.P. (42) 298) on the state, of public opinion in(Previous this country.Reference:W.M. (42) 74thConclusions, --------------------------.........-Minute 5.)Parliament. 9.   The War Cabinet had a short discussion oh the out-Dates of Recess, standing business of the House.The War Cabinet were informed that some Members might ask for a Debate to take place on Air Co-operation with the Armybefore the Recess. It was agreed that, owing to impending changes,this would be a bad time to have a discussion on this matter, butthat it might be indicated that facilities would be offered for a discussion in September., The Lord Privy Seal, proposed that he should announce thatthe House would adjourn on Thursday, 6th August, until Tuesday,8th September.The War Cabinet approved this proposal.Great George Street, S.W.1,July 20, 1942.
