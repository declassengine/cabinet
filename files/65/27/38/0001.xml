In reply to Supplementary Questions, the Lord PrivyConclusions Seal-had said that, should the House so desire, the question of IndiaMinute l)&apos; could be raised on the Adjournment on Friday, and, further, thatthe Government would, if desired, be prepared to; give itiriie for afurther discussion when the House returned after the Recess.Since then it had become necessary to rearrange the business for this series of Sittings in view of the fact that the Debate on theWar Situation was not to continue for a second day. There was now no specific business for the fourth Sitting Day, and in thesecircumstances the question had been raised whether a Debate on india could be taken on that day.While it was recognised that there was nothing to preventMembers raising the Indian situation as one of the matters fordiscussion on the Adjournment on Friday, the general feeling of theWar Cabinet was that it would be inexpedient, at this stage, to devote a whole day to the discussion of Indian questions.-The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) There should be no organised Debate on India during thepresent series of Sittings. The Prime Minister wouldmake a short statement on India in reply to a private notice Question on Thursday, the 10th September.There would be no opportunity to debate this statement that day, as the House would proceed at once to a debate on Service Pay on the Supplementary Vote of Credit(Report Stage). If Members showed a desire to discuss this statement, they should be reminded that, if theHouse so desired, this could be raised as one of thematters for discussion on the Adjournment on Friday,the 11th September.(2) The Lord Privy Seal should make an announcement in this sense in the statement on Business which he was to makeimmediately after the meeting.

MOST SECRET.W.M. (42) 122nd CONCLUSIONS.CONFIDENTIAL RECORD.(9th September, 1942 - 11.15 a.m.)(No Circulation)parliament. On the previous day the Debate on the War Situation,which had been planned to la.st two days, had come to an endon War Situation.eptembsr, 1942.       shortly after the speech by the Leader of the Opposition, as there was no general desire to continue the discussion.     Onthe Motion for the Adjournment, there had been some criticalcomments about the collapse of the Debate;    and the Lord privy seal indicated displeasure that Members had not wished to take part in the discussion and that a number af -Memboro ohould-b&amp;&amp;e left while the Prime Minister and the Leader of theOpposition were speaking (Official Report, columns 110 - 113)*THE PRIME MINISTER said that this statement by theLord Privy Seal might be construed as an encouragement to members to make speeches critical of the Government&apos;s conductof the war.     In his view, it was satisfactory that members should have found in his speech nothing on which they wishedto comment.     He welcomed the silent support of the House ofCommons and he deprecated the view that Parliament was notfulfilling its function unless it was actively and criticallydebating the war situation.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he had not regretted the absence of critical speeches;   but he still thought it amatter for regret that the House had let pass this opportunity

for public expression of their support of the Government&apos;policy.     In his view the collapse of the Debate woiild produce a bad effect, both in this country and abroad, and would damage the prestige of Parliament as an active partner^in the prosecution of the war.     Debate was an essential function ofParliament, even in war time.     Even critical speeches couldbe of assistance to the Government in their conduct of the war -and it was a mistake to assume that all criticism was necessarilycaptious or hostile.He had thought it specially regrettable that so many members should have left the Chamber while the Leader of theOpposition was still speaking - and that some should even have left before the Prime Minister had completed his speech.     Hewas disappointed that Members of the House should not show amore serious attitude towards their duties;   and he had thoughtit appropriate that he should make some reference to this beforethe House rose.On this point, reference was made to the inconvenience ofthe hours at which the House now sat.     The opening speech in a debate often continued beyond the normal luncheon hour;   and members who had luncheon engagements often found themselvescompelled to leave before the opening speaker had sat down.It was also to be remembered that the meetings of Committees andother bodies which formed an essential part of the life ofParliament had now to be crowded into three days a week - withthe result that, wtea-lo fcka House was-sitting, a high proportionof Members had many parliamentary engagements to fulfil whileDebates were being held.     The question of altering the hours ofthe sittings had been discussed from time to time - for exampleit had been suggested that the sittings might commence at 2 p.ra.For a variety of reasons, however, (including transport

difficulties and the early hour$ at which newspapers now went to press)   it had always been found impossible to secure agreement to an arrangement by which the sittings would commenceafter luncheon.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that it was satisfactory that Members should haye felt that the PrimeMinister&apos;s speech left nothing on which they wished to comment -and that in those circumstances it might have been preferable toleave it to be assumed that
