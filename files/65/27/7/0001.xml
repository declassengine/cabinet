135W.M. 91 (42).Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 86thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Malta.Egypt.naval operations.EussianConvoy.MilitaryOperations.Egypt.Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.Weather had limited the operations of Bomber Command, buta successful attack had been made oh the submarine dockyards willhelmshaven, where 570 tons of bombs had been dropped; andthe submarine dockyards at Danzig had been bombed in daytime.Total enemy losses for the week amounted to 12 machines forcertain, 1 probable and 10 damaged. We had lost 1 fighter,15 bombers and 8 Coastal Command aircraft.Malta had been attacked on an increasing scale during theprevious week. The enemy losses amounted to 72 machines forcertain, 16 probable and 55 damaged. Our losses amounted to26 machines destroyed (5 on the ground) and 27 damaged.Since the 10th July we had carried out intensive air operations.The enemy losses amounted to 51 machines for certain, 28 probableand 81 damaged. We had lost 39 destroyed, 1 probable and11 damaged.Allied shipping losses in the previous seven days amounted to254,000 tons. This figure did not include the losses sustained in the outward- and homeward-bound Russian convoys.Four ships of the recent Russian convoy had reached Archangel.It was hoped that five other ships would reach port.The Prime Minister said that it was proposed to settle thequestion of the sailing of the next Russian convoy at a meeting ofthe Defence Committee to be held that evening.This was agreed to.The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he had asked that enquiries should be made by the Admiralty into thefollowing questions: (i) Why the transport Orizaba -had been given orders toproceed to a wrong destination,(ii) Whether any responsibility attached to any of our Officersin respect of the loss of certain American ships in areturning convoy, in a minefield off Iceland.In a successful attack on the 10th July we had captured2,000 prisoners (mainly Italians), destroyed 23 tanks and captureda number of guns. The enemy had counter-attacked our newpositions, but all our gains had been held.The Germans claimed that in operations near Rezh they hadtaken 30,000 prisoners. This claim seemed improbable. South ofOrel, where the enemy had made his main thrusts, the Germans had succeeded in cutting the railway line from Moscow to Rostov overa considerable distance&apos;. They had advanced some 100 miles during18 days-a much slower rate than in the earlier attacks in 1941.The Germans claimed 88,000 prisoners, which, considering thewidth of the front and the depth of the advance, did not seem a verylarge number.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Middle East.Condition of tanks arriving.[24105]2. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a telegramfrom Cairo referring to the &quot; reported bad condition of Valentinetanks on disembarkation.&quot;The Secretary of State for War said that, while his Depart-ment was responsible up to the time of shipment, the Ministry ofWar Transport were responsible for stowage on board. Until thefacts had been ascertained, responsibility for any shortcomingsb 2
could not be assigned. He gave details of the inspection processesthe tanks in question.had undergone before shipment.The Prime Minister said that he had called for a detailedreport from Cairo. He suggested that as soon as it was received an investigation should be made by the Lord Privy Seal on behalf of theWar Cabinet in order that, if the despatching authorities were to blame, severe measures might be taken.The War Cabinet agreed to the Prime Minister&apos;suggestion.Middle East..Levant-CaspianFront.Co-operationwith theRussians.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 74thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that General Quinan had had some talks with the Russians, but they had not led to any concreteresults. It was for consideration whether he (the Foreign Secretary)should take up with M. Maisky the question of staff talks aboutcommon defence problems in the Caucasus and Middle East areas.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that general auchinleck had several times pressed that these talks should takeplace.In discussion, it was suggested that a suitable procedure mightbe for the matter to be mentioned to General Isayef, and then leftto be raised by our Military Mission in Moscow at a suitable opportunity.The general conclusion reached by the War Cabinet was,however, that on balance It would be better not to take this matter up for the present, but to await further developments of the militarysituation in the Middle East.United States ofAmerica.British SupplyOrganisation in washington.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 132ndConclusions,Minute 1.),4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (42) 291) dealing, in particular, with;the position&quot; and powers of Sir Robert Sinclair, recently appointedDeputy to the Minister on the Combined Production and resources board in Washington.   The Minister proposed (1) That the Heads of the Supply Missions (other than theFood Mission), while remaining responsible in theirprocurement work to their respective Ministries inLondon, should follow any directions which Sir RobertSinclair, under his (the Ministers) authority, might find it necessary to give them in the fulfilment of his functions.(2) That it should be recognised that the appointment of theChairman of the British Supply Council was within his(the Minister&apos;s) authority and that he was responsible to him. It was proposed that Sir Robert Sinclair shouldbe a member of the Supply Council and that he shouldnot replace Mr. R. H. Brand as Chairman, at any ratefor the time being.In discussion, it was suggested that it ought to be put on record that the new arrangement proposed involved no alteration inresponsibility for handling food and shipping questions atWashington.Subject to this caveat, the War Cabinet approved the proposals in W.P. (42)291.

(42) 56thConclusions,Minute 8.)Parliament.The shipping situation.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 89thConclusions.)Shipping Losses.False EnemyReports.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary(W.P. (42) 290) covering a Memorandum received from the public accounts Committee asking whether the Government saw any objection, on Security or other grounds, to the publication ofparticulars (including names) of the firms which had been mentioned adversely&apos; in the Comptroller and Auditor-General&apos;sReport.The War Cabinet decided that there was no objection tothe names of the firms being published, provided that theiraddresses and the stores they supplied were not disclosed.The Secretary was instructed to arrange for a reply to besent, conveying this decision to the Committee.6. Further discussion took place on the forthcoming debate in Secret Session on the Shipping Situation.Reference was made to a suggestion by Mr. AneurinBevan, M.P., that, at the end of the Secret Session, the Speakershould be authorised to issue a much fuller report than had beenmade after Secret Sessions during the present war.The War Cabinet were reminded that in the last war veryfull reports had been made, giving the names of Members whohad taken part in the Debate.In discussion, considerable difficulties were seen in theadoption of this suggestion. From the nature of the case, thestatement would have to be impartial and uninformative. Itwould not therefore give satisfaction to those Members ofParliament who held strong views; nor would it be satisfactorythat the opinions expressed by a small unorganised opposition should be treated as on an equality with those of a national government with an overwhelming majority.The Prime Minister said that, if the War Cabinet so wished,he would be prepared to see the editors of the principal newspapersafter the Debate.The War Cabinet-(1). Agreed, that no encouragement should be given toMr. Aneurih Bevan&apos;s suggestion that, on the occasion of the forthcoming Secret Session on Shipping, the speaker should be authorised to issue a much fullerreport than had been issued on previous occasions :(2) Welcomed the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion that he should see the editors of the principal newspapers in regard- to the Shipping Situation, and invited the Minister ofInformation to make arrangements accordingly.7. The War Cabinet were informed that recent enemybroadcasts about our shipping losses had included the names ofcertain ships which were still afloat. This showed that the enemy&apos;sinformation was inaccurate. Such announcements might never-theless be deeply disturbing to the families affected.. The Prime Minister thought that the right way of dealingwith this matter would be for a public statement to be made giving an assurance that the next of kin were invariably and promptlyinformed when a ship had gone down. Relations of seamen should therefore ignore enemy propaganda statements on shipping losses.This suggestion was approved.
8.   The War Cabinet had before them (a) Telegram 2056G from the Viceroy to the Secretary ofState for India, summarising a Resolution passed bythe Congress Working Committee on the 10th July, aspublished in the Hindustan Times :-(b) Telegram 5419, dated the 11th July, from the Governmentof India Home Department.The Secretary of State for India said that, while the finalResolution of the Congress Working Committee referred to in telegram 5419 had not yet been textually agreed upon, theResolution summarised in the former telegram was too serious to ignore. The Congress Working Committee, claiming the positionof an authority parallel to that of the Government, deliberatelyinstructed people to resist the Governments action in regard to measures such as the removal of boats or vehicles. This was an intolerable challenge, and was made worse when read together with paragraph 4 of the Resolution which said that &quot; All restrictionson organisation for self-protection should be disregarded.&quot;Continuing, the Secretary of State said that he thought it right to bring this Resolution to the immediate notice of the WarCabinet, who should authorise the Viceroy, if the terms of theResolution were confirmed, to take such action as he thought necessary, including possibly the immediate arrest of Gandhi.In discussion, the War Cabinet were reminded that inparagraph 10 of his telegram dated the 26th June (circulated as W.P. (42) 271), the Viceroy had said that there was not a greatdeal to be gained at that stage by examining, for the benefit ofthe Cabinet, alternative possibilities; he would prefer to wait untilthe Working Committee had met, and thereafter to advise theCabinet in the light of their conclusions. It was pointed out thatthe Viceroy had not yet put forward any proposals as to the actionwhich should be taken, consequent upon the passing of this resolution of the 10th July.The view was also expressed that it by no means followed that the Congress Working Committee possessed the power whichthey claimed, or that their so-called instructions would be at allgenerally acted upon.The Prime Minister said that we were responsible for thedefence of India. It was essential that we should have the samefacilities for the defence of India as we had for the defence ofthis country. He thought that it would be reasonable that theSecretary of State for India should give the Viceroy an immediateassurance that, if in the opinion of the Government of India thesituation should make it necessary to take strong measures in orderto ensure the same co-operation in the defence of India as wehad in this country, they would, receive the fullest support fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government.The War Cabinet-Approved this suggestion, and authorised the Secretaryof State for India to send a telegram to the Viceroy onthe lines proposed by the Prime Minister.9. The Secretary of State for India said that, during theLord Privy Seal&apos;s visit to India, the question had been raised whether the Government of India should adopt a more lenientattitude towards members Of the Communist Party in India whowere anxious to play their part in the fight against Fascism. Anumber of students had been released, and the Government ofIndia now desired to make an announcement raising the ban onthe Communist Party in India, and on its newspapers.India.(previous reference:W.M.

139W.M. 91 (42).The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said that,while he raised no objection to the action proposed, he thought itmight be made a debating point in Parliament, in connection withour attitude towards the Daily Worker, and that it was thereforeright that it had been mentioned to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet-Agreed that no objection need be raised to the course ofaction proposed.Parliament.Prolongation of&quot;the life of theUnited King-dom parliament and of theHouse ofCommons ofNorthernIreland.10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (W.P. (42) 287) explaining that legislative provision was required, not only for extending the life of theUnited Kingdom Parliament, but also for extending the life ofthe House of Commons in Northern Ireland which, under Sec-tion 14 (4) of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, was due to expire on the 1st March, 1943. The general considerations which made a General Election undesirable in time of war were as validin the case of Northern Ireland as in that of Great Britain. TheMinister therefore asked for the authorisation of the WarCabinet to announce that the Government contemplated introducing legislation for prolonging the life of the United kingdom parliament for another year from November 1942, and that they proposed to include in the Bill provision enabling the life of theHouse of Commons in Northern Ireland to be prolonged for ayear from March 1943, provided, such prolongation was approvedby a resolution of the Northern Ireland House of Commons.The War Cabinet approved these proposals.Great George Street, S.W. 1.July 13, 1942.

Final form of resolution of Congress Working Committee is likely to be released shortly. Indications derived mainly from intelligent anticipations in messages of press correspondents s? ? censorship are that it will attribute regrettable spirit of defeatism in this country to British political treatment of India and will appeal to the Allied Powers to bring pressure on His Majesty&apos;s Government to grant India freedom for ostensible purpose of galvanizing war effort. With ?reat that if this appeal is rejected or prove unsuccessful. Congress will launch whirlwind ss? civil disobedience movement on the lines of earlier movements. ? will be under Gandhi&apos;s supreme direction and control and will discard any attempt at non-embarrassment.

Resolution in these terms, apart from disingeniousness ? its (? premises) which are no doubt designed to secure American and Chinese sympathy, would be sheer blackmail and could not be allowed to pass unchallenged. We propose to await final test and then consider whether to ban publication either in India or outside or both, but we believe that such a course should neither effective nor desirable from our own point of view. In any case action against Congress organisation will have to follow if the threat is implemented and need for effective propaganda on the lines of my telegram No. 4484 dated June 6th becomes of immediate and vital importance both in England, America and other allied countries.

Until final text is released we are holding up all outgoing press messages referred to in paragraph No. 1 since we see a reason why advance Congress propaganda should be permitted and before publication of resolution we proposed to hold press conference ?re at which our case would be explained. We are also warning Provincial Governments to overhaul plans for dealing with mass civil disobedience movement on the lines explained in my letter of August 2nd 1940 which was Communicatied to you with Home Department letter 3/13/(? 40) dated August ?th 1940. We shall of course address you again if we consider it necessary to promulgate Emergency Powers Ordinances. Much will depend on the character of the movement threatened. In any case we assume considerable interval will elapse before movement itself is launched and Gandhi will give us full notice of his intentions.
