The War Cabinet had a further discussion on this subject,which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.United States ofAmerica.accommodation for UnitedStates Forces inthis Country.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 54thConclusions.). 3. The Minister of Labour and National Service said that considerable enthusiasm had been aroused, and success achieved, inthe organisation of the building labour required to ensure comple-tion, by the due dates, of the building programme to accommodate the United States troops coming to this country. It appeared,however, that there had been some hitch in the letting of the contracts, and that only 14 per cent, of the total contracts involvedhad been let. As a result, between 50,000 and 100,000 men were ready to be employed on building work for these contracts, but no work was at present available for them He feared that the delaymight have very serious consequences.The Secretary of State for War said that it had not been easy to discover exactly where the hitch had occurred. The whole position was being investigated by Sir Findlater Stewart, as chairman of the Bolero Committee. So far as concerned the mainblock of contracts for which the War Office were responsible(amounting to, say, some  50 millions in all), contracts worth 26 millions had been cleared by the United States authorities,which meant that the general location had been agreed. This lattertotal comprised (a) contracts worth over  8 millions which hadbeen let; (b) contracts worth a further  8 millions which wouldbe let within seven days; (c) contracts worth  10 millions in regardto which the exact site within the general location had not yet been ,determined. He was taking special steps to see that there was nounnecessary delay as a result of any differences of opinion overlocation of sites in these cases.The Secretary of State also referred to the fact that there was still considerable doubt as to the total size of the building require-ments under various heads.The War Cabinet-; Invited the Lord President of the Council, as Chairmanof the Committee of Ministers appointed to settledifferences in regard to the Bolero programme, to enquire into the point raised by the Minister of Labour and national Service.Great George Street, S.W. 1,August 11, 1942.Madagascar. 1.
