In connection with the discussion recorded in the previousPublication to    Minute, a short discussion took place as to whether we shouldbe discontinued, continue to publish our aircraft losses.  The general view was thatpublication of these losses must be of considerable assistance to theenemy, and that it &quot;should be discontinued on these grounds.The War Cabinet accordingly agreed r- (a) That the publication of aircraft losses should be discon-tinued. The announcement should take the form of ananswer to a Parliamentary Question, which should saythat, since publication of these losses was of considerableassistance to the enemy, it was proposed to discontinuetheir publication as from the end of the month.The Lord Privy Seal was invited to make thenecessary arrangements. : -..     &apos; [24381-lj;. .    b21. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.Bomber raids had been carried out on Essen; Wilhelmshaven,Saarbrucken and Munich, and a record number of mines hadbeen laid.The Secretary of State for Air was invited to draft asuitable message for the War Cabinet to despatch at theend of the month, congratulating Bomber Command ontheir activities during September.Coastal Command had made 12 attacks on TJ-boats in the Bayof Biscay and 1 in the Mediterranean. Four of these attacks hadbeen promising, and a U-boat was believed to have been sunk in theMediterranean.In the Home theatre the enemy had had 13 aircraft destroyed,2 probably destroyed and 16 damaged. Our losses had beeri4 fighters, 57 bombers and 8 Coastal Command aircraft.German air activity in the Middle East had increased. We hadattacked Tobruk Harbour and had sunk a 7,000-ton merchant shipoff Derna, as well as a number of smaller ships. Enemy aircraftlosses had been 14 destroyed, 16 probably destroyed and 36 damaged.Our losses had been 18 fighters.Twenty-seyen ships out of 40 in the recent convoy had arrivedat Archangel. It was believed that a considerable toll had beentaken of enemy aircraft, and that a number of their submarines hadbeen damaged or sunk.During the previous seven days our losses (including the lossesin the Russian convoy and the liner Laconia) had been 216,000 tonsDetails were given of operations which had included attackson Tobruk Harbour and on Benghazi. Generally speaking, theseoperations had not been very successful.There had been little change in the situation in Egypt duringthe past week. The enemy was regrouping his forces and makingdefensive preparations.Operations in Madagascar continued successfully and ourtroops were now advancing on the capital.At Stalingrad the Russians were still fighting fiercely, but thesituation was very confused. The Russians continued to counter-attack from north of the city. On the north bank of the RiverTerek the Germans had regained some of their lost ground. In theCaucasus Passes the Russians had counter-attacked with somesuccess, and further west the Germans had made no furtherprogress. While the position at Stalingrad was, perhaps, rathermore serious, it was satisfactory that the enemy had made suchsmall progress during the week, notwithstanding the heavy lossesincurred.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
(&amp;) That there was ho objection to the personnel of the RoyalAir Force being informed of aircraft losses, and that, ifParliament pressed for the information, it could be givenin Secret Session.Air Raids.Damage andCasualties.(PreviousReference:W.M. (42) 119thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat there had been a number of small tip-and-run raids over thecoast.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that on.one of these raidsconsiderable damage had been done to Dartmouth College, but, asthe College had been in vacation, there had been only one fatalservice casualty. In view of the risks involved in present circum-stances, the Admiralty were considering some measure of dispersionfrom the College. . .0       The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The FightingFrench.Admission tothis Countryof M. Vallin.4. Reference was made to the admission to this country ofM. Vallin, who had formerly been associated with the French Croixde Feu.It was explained that, owing to an oversight, the Home Officehad not been consulted before arrangements had.been made to bringM. Vallin to this country. In future cases the Home Office wouldbe.consulted.The question was also raised whether criticism was likely to bemade if persons who had been prominently associated with a Frenchbody of Fascist tendencies were brought to this country. Thegeneral view of the War Cabinet was that such criticisms would nothave much force, bearing in mind that persons, such as M. AndrePhilip, who held very different political views, had welcomedM. Vallin&apos;s arrival in this country.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Refugees.Jewish refugeesfrom France.5. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityreferred to the pressure being exercised by M. Laval to drive Jewishrefugees out of France. The Jewish organisations were nowurging that we should allow Jewish refugees from France to cometo this country.The Home Secretary said that, while any general claim of thiskind must be resisted, he thought that consideration might have tobe given to the admission to this country of a limited number ofrefugees in special categories, e.g., children who already hadrelations over here.The War Cabinet-Asked the Home Secretary to submit a Memorandumdealing with this matter.T^rT^&apos;      w -6-   Tho War Cabinet had before them a. Memorandum by theThe B.B.C.      Minister of Information (W.P. (42) 414).The Minister claimed that the Advisory Committee on CivilService Man-Power (the Kennet Committee) had not shownsufficient realisation either of the importance of maintaining anefficient broadcasting system.as part of the country&apos;s propagandaservices, or of the need for the deferment of the military service ofan adequate number of the younger members of the B.B.C. staff forthis purpose. He asked that a suitable instruction might be issuedto the Kennet Committee on this matter and that the reservations
of staff due to run out at the end of the current month might becontinued until they had been reconsidered by the Committee in thelight of any instruction that might be issued to them.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Invited the Minister of Information to confer with theMinister of Labour and National Service with a view toa settlement of the issues involved.7. The Secretary of State for War said that a film about&quot;Colonel Blimp &quot; was being made. Facilities had been asked forfrom the War Office. These had been refused, on the ground thatthe film was likely to bring ridicule upon the Army. The producershad nevertheless proceeded with the making of the film, which wasnow at an advanced stage.There was no existing Defence Regulation under which thefilm could be suppressed. He understood that the Minister ofInfo? lation was averse from taking the very wide powers whichwould be necessary to stop this film.More recently, however, an approach had been made to thefinancier who was backing the film, who had agreed that, when thefilm had reached the &quot; rough-cut stage,&quot; it should be seen by repre-sentatives of the War Office and the Ministry of Information, andthat, if they took the view the film was undesirable, he wouldarrange for it to be withdrawn.&apos; .General agreement was expressed with the view that it wasimpossible to allow a film to be produced which was liable to under-mine the discipine of the Army; and satisfaction was expressedthat this could be achieved by the friendly arrangement outlined bythe Secretary of State for War.Great George Street, S.W. 1,September 21, 1942.
