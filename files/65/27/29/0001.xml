Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 109thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Malta.Egypt.naval operations.Malta Convoy.SolomonIslands.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thelast week.Bomber Command had carried out two very successful raids on Mainz, where 135 acres of the town were believed to have beendevastated.The enemy had carried out a number of nuisance raids, mainlyover East Anglia. Enemy losses had been 5 destroyed and13 damaged. We had lost 4 fighters, 33 bombers, 8 coastal command aircraft and 2 Army Co-operation aircraft.In the convoy action R.A.F. aircraft based in Malta had destroyed 11 enemy aircraft with the loss of 4. Apart from these operations, activity had been on a reduced scale. In the week theenemy had lost 28 aircraft for certain and we had lost 8.Among other operations, we had carried out raids on Tobrukinvolving over 300 aircraft.A full account was given of the operations connected with the malta Convoy.In the fighting off the Solomon Islands the Japanese had sunkthe Australian cruiser Canberra and 3 out of 4 8-inch UnitedStates cruisers. United States Forces were believed to have landedon two of the Solomon Islands.  Tulagi was in their hands.Merchant shipping losses during the past week amounted to204,000 tons. This total included 88,000 tons lost in the MaltaConvoy and belated reports of the loss of 47,000 tons.The enemy had made little progress in their attempts to reachStalingrad from the west- and south-west. They claimed to havereached the Don in the whole of the &quot; elbow.&quot;German progress on the Caucasus front had slowed down. Inthe north they had reached Elista, 175 miles west of Astrakhan.In the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains the enemy were southof the Kuban River and advancing, in the face of stout russian resistance, in the direction of Tuapse. Further east the enemy had reached Georgievsk.The War Cabinet-(i) Asked the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretaryof State for Air to send messages on their behalf to the commanders concerned in the Malta Convoy operation,expressing their appreciation of the gallantry shown bythe Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and the merchant navy.(ii) Invited the Minister of Information to take steps at theappropriate time, in consultation with the First Lord&quot;    of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air, toensure that the public was made aware that the opera-tion had achieved its purpose.U.S.S.R. 2.   The Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsRussian reported that a telegram had been received from Moscow to the effectWarships and that it had not been deemed appropriate to raise this matter at theMerchant Ships present time.^, th,e    &apos; The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Black Sea.(previous reference:W.M.

FightingServices.   -Public State-ments byServing Officers.(Previous ,Reference:W.M. (40) 301stConclusions,Minute 2.)3. Reference was made to the reports in the newspapers of sunday, the 16th August, of a speech made in the United states by Air Vice-Marshal Lloyd, lately Air Officer Commanding in malta.The War Cabinet were informed that Air Vice-Marshal Lloydhad been asked to make a public statement by a member of the staffof the Embassy at Washington concerned with propaganda. beyond this, nothing was known except what had appeared in the Press.The Secretary of State for Air said that in this country nosuch public statement could be made by an officer of the R.A.F.without his consent. For all practical purposes, no fresh rule was required, except as regards statements made in the United States.The view generally taken was that, while public statements in the United States by serving Officers often, served a useful purpose, they should be confined to a script which had been sub-mitted to and approved by the Ambassador, and, in appropriate cases, by the Joint Staff Mission. It was undesirable that serving officers should give interviews to the Press which might, cover a wide range of subjects, though it was important that any rulinggiven should not be so tightly drawn as to forbid tours by junior officers of the Services who had been concerned in particularexploits.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for Air to ascertain the circumstances in which the public statement, which had given rise tothis discussion, had been made.(2) Laid it down that, as a general rule, Staff Officers of highrank, or Officers who had held high Commands, shouldnot give interviews to the Press in the United States;nor should they make any public statements or speeches in the United States unless the script had been approvedby the Ambassador and,. in appropriate cases, a repre-sentative of the Joint Staff Mission.The Women&apos;services.Report&apos; ofCommittee onAmenities andWelfareConditions.Question of publication.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the deputy prime Minister (W.P. (42) 361) covering the Report of the Com-mittee on Amenities and Welfare Conditions in the three Women&apos;services. The issue for consideration was whether the report should be published forthwith, without waiting for decisions to bereached by Departments on the recommendations contained in it.It was pointed out that effect had been given to a considerablenumber of the recommendations during the compilation of theReport, and that it would be an advantage that this should be made clear at the time of publication.The Minister of Labour and National Service referred to therecommendations in paragraphs 150-151 and 211-212 of the Report.He would welcome further consideration of the extent to whichimmobile units and part-time civilian labour could be used in thethree Services.The Secretary of State for War said that he had already setup a Committee to examine all mixed establishments, and that hewould arrange for this matter to be considered by this Committee.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows :-(1) Arrangements should be made for the Report to bepublished as a Parliamentary Paper as soon as was practicable.
(2) At the time of publication, the Press should be told that effect had been given to a number of the Committee&apos;s. recommendations while the Report was being compiled,and emphasis should be laid on the fact that the Reportdispelled the allegations of malpractices which had beencurrent at an earlier date.(3) The Service Ministers and the Minister of information should consult together in regard to the statementreferred to in (2) and the arrangements for publication.5. The Lord President of the Council reported that sir Findlater Stewart had had a letter from General Eisenhowerto the effect that the United- States military forces did not nowdesire to take advantage of the offer of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto provide the Carlton Hotel as premises for a Club to be run inLondon for American Officers.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.6. The War Cabinet were given the latest information aboutthe state of public order in India. Over the country as a whole thesituation was easier, but there was some cause for anxiety about theposition in Bihar. The widespread interference with communica-tions indicated a premeditated purpose, but the results suggestedthat Congress had not had time to perfect their organisation. Sofar, there had been no serious communal trouble in any part ofIndia.Reference was made to the suggestion made in a telegram froma Provincial Governor that the publication in the Indian press of reports of incidents in certain areas was leading to the spread of disorder to other parts of the country. The Secretary of State forIndia said that the Viceroy was watching this position, and suggested that he might be left to take such steps as he thoughtwise to restrict publication of these reports in the Indian press.As regards press reports in this country, it was suggested that,after the excessive publicity during the first few days, there might now be some tendency to mislead the public into thinking that alldanger in India was now over. The Minister of Informationundertook to give some guidance to the Press on this point.7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (W.P. (42) 362) suggesting that an assurance should be given to the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government would neither renew negotiations with congress, or any other Indian political party, except after full consultation with the Government of India, nor modify its present policy as a result of pressure from the United States, China, or anyother of the United Nations. Annexed to the Memorandum was adraft telegram to the Viceroy giving an assurance on these points.The Secretary of State for India handed round copies of anamended draft telegram which had been prepared to meet thesuggestion that the assurance should not include a reference to pressure from Allied countries.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for India to telegraph tothe Viceroy in the terms of the amended draft.
India.Detention of gandhi.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 109thConclusions,Minute 7.) .8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (W.P. (42) 363) covering an exchangeof telegrams with the Viceroy. These telegrams gave the Viceroy&apos;sanswer to the suggestion that, if Gandhi fasted, he should be sentback to Sevagram, where the responsibility for looking after himwould be that of his friends. The Viceroy replied that detentionat Sevagram had been considered and was not regarded as practic-able. It appeared that the Viceroy&apos;s advisers still held the viewthat, if Gandhi fasted, it would be necessary to release him uncon-ditionally as soon as.it was thought that his life was in danger.In discussion, it was suggested that, if Gandhi was not to beheld in detention, whatever the consequences, there was much tobe said for releasing him as soon as he began to fast. The responsi-bility for deciding when the point had been reached at which further fasting would endanger his life must be left to the medical officer; in practice, no instruction could be given to him by theGovernment of India which would limit his professional discretion.Left with this responsibility, he would certainly take no risks.The Lord President of the Council said that the Viceroy&apos;attitude on this point confirmed his view that the War Cabinet hadbeen right in recommending at the outset that Gandhi should bedeported rather than detained in India. He feared that the course which the Viceroy now favoured would be interpreted as a sign of weakness on the part of the Government of India. He therefore suggested that it would be wise to put more specifically to theViceroy the suggestion made in the discussion at the War Cabineton the 10th August (W.M. (42) 109th Conclusions, Minute 7), that ghandi should be detained under such conditions as would leavethe Government of India free of responsibility for safeguardinghis life and health. What he had in mind was something like thesystem of &quot; house domicile,&quot; which was well known in India.Gandhi would be placed in a suitable house, where some of his friends could, if he wished, be interned with him, and a close guardwould be maintained round it in order to restrict his freedom of movement, visits and communications. It would, however, be made clear that the Government assumed no responsibility for his foodor living conditions or for his health and welfare. He could havehis own medical advisers, and,, if he was attended by a medical officer in the employ of the Government of India, this wjould be only.at his own request. Having thus made it clear that they were concerned only to prevent him from carrying on his revolutionarycampaign and that they assumed no responsibility for his life and health,, the Government of India could then, if Gandhi chose to fast,leave him to take the consequences. The responsibility would rest with Gandhi himself and his friends and medical advisers.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for India to inform theViceroy that the War Cabinet felt considerable anxiety about the policy envisaged in his telegram No. 2443-S ofthe 16th August. It was, in their view, important to avoid a situation in which Gandhi or his followers couldinterpret his release from detention as a victory in hisstruggle against the Government of India. In thesecircumstances, they wished the Viceroy to give furtherconsideration to the possibility of modifying the conditionsof Gandhi&apos;s detention, on the lines indicated by the lord president in the course of the discussion, so as to leavethe Government of India free of responsibility for safe-guarding his life and health, and thus able, if he chose to-fast, to leave him to take the consequences.
North AmericanSupplyCommittee.British supply council in north America.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 91stConclusions,Minute 4.)10. The War Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (42) 353)-(i) Setting out revised Terms of Reference for the north american Supply Committee and the Supply Council in north America; and(ii) Stating that it was proposed to invite the High Commis-sioner for Canada in the United Kingdom to be amember of the North American Supply Committee assoon as sufficient progress had been made withdiscussions&apos; regarding the association of Canada withthe work of the various Combined Boards.Mr. W. Nash. 11.   The Deputy Prime Minister said that this was the last meeting which Mr.  Nash would  attend before returning to, Washington.  On behalf of the War Cabinet, he would like to say how glad they had been,to welcome Mr. Nash to their meetings.They hoped that he would be able to visit them again before long.These views were cordially endorsed by the War Cabinet.Great George Street, S.W. 1,August 17, 1942.Indla- 9.

Invited the Secretary of State for India (i) To inform the Viceroy that the War Cabinet, while they did not suggest the withdrawal of the state-ment already made regarding the availability ofcorporal punishment .for certain offences of violence,would strongly deprecate any extensive use of thispenalty, and hoped that steps would be taken toensure that it would be used most sparingly by thecourts.(ii) To ascertain what instrument was used for carryingout sentences of corporal punishment in India,(iii) To consider whether some statement could not beissued for the guidance of the Press in this countryand the United States, indicating the limited extentto which the courts would, in fact, impose sentences of corporal punishment in these cases.
