The Press.(PreviousEeferences:W.M. (42) 101stConclusions,Minute 1; andW.M. (42) 36thConclusions,Minute 8.)2. The War Cabinet considered an article, published theprevious day in a Sunday newspaper, dealing with the second front. This article imputed bad faith to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and was calculated to injure Anglo-Soviet relations.The question was raised whether an approach to the Editorson this matter was likely to prove effective at the present time. Thesuggestion was made that, if a statement could be made in confidence to the Editors, to the effect that definite decisions hadbeen taken in regard to the opening of a Second Front, and that theissue was not, therefore, an open one which could be affected by theviews expressed in regard to it, there would probably be a diminution of the agitation in the Press. Such a statement,however, would probably not have any effect on those newspaperswhich had already taken a leading part in this matter.The War Cabinet-Decided that for the present no action should be taken inregard to this matter.Parliament. 3.   At their meeting on the 1st August the War Cabinet hadSupplies to decided that, if, in the course of the. debate on the ConsolidatedEussia.

Pay and Allowances after the Recess. in preparation for this Debate, and with a viewto removing uncertainties and misapprehensionswhich seemed to be widespread, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment proposed to issue a White paper which would contain the material necessary toenable a judgment to be reached on this matter.(2) Since this White Paper would deal with the Pay and allowances of all three Services, the above answer shouldbe given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(3) A draft White Paper, which would cover the Pay and allowances of Junior Officers, as well as of other ranks,should be prepared by the Service Ministers and theChancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation, and shouldbe submitted in draft to the War Cabinet.
should add that the Government were satisfied that there had been no lack of care or resolution in this matter on the part of the responsible officers.The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Lord privy seal (W.P. (42) 337) covering the draft of a statement about the attack on the July convoy. This had originally been prepared bythe Admiralty for issue to the Press, before the Prime Minister had decided that no public statement should be made at that stage.The Lord Privy Seal invited the views of the War Cabinet onthe extent to which this draft might form the basis of any statement which it might be necessary to make in Secret Session.A short discussion took place, in the course of which certain suggestions were put forward for the amendment of the draft statement.The War Cabinet-Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to prepare a revised draft in the light of the discussion and of thedecision taken at the meeting on the 1st August. the revised draft would be considered by the War Cabinet attheir meeting on the following day.Far East.China.(previous reference:W.M.

The Foreign Secretary drew attention to a recent telegramfrom His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in China (No. 1087, dated the1st August) regarding the growth of anti-British feeling in China.While recognising the great difficulties in getting through to china any supplies from British sources, he hoped that the service ministers would bear in mind that, from the political^point of view,even small contributions to China&apos;s war effort would be helpful inchecking the spread of anti-British feeling. The Secretary of Statefor Air undertook to consider a suggestion that British aircraft might be sent to China in substitution for American aircraftalready operating from there.Reference was also made to the effect on Anglo-Chineserelations of the breakdown of the credit negotiations. HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador was sending a further telegram on thissubject; and the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer undertook to give further consideration to the positionas soon as that telegram had been received.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Middle East.evacuation of CivilianPersonnel.(previous reference:W.M.

The Foreign Secretary informed the War Cabinet that on further consideration it had been found necessary to make certain limited exceptions to the general ruling that no steps should betaken at this stage for the evacuation of British civilians fromterritories in the Middle East. These exceptions applied to certainclasses of -persons in Persia, Palestine and Iraq, and the measures taken would be unobtrusive.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Great George Street, S.

The moreimportant consideration was, however, the psychological effect of newspaper publicity,which tended to give the men in the Services theimpression that they were under-paid.In the circumstances his advisersworo disposed to recommend -(a) an increaso of 1/- a day in the basic pay of private soldiers, and smallerincreases for non-commissioned officers^-up to, say, the rank of sergeant.(b) for officers, promotion from secondlieutenant to lieutenant after months&apos;, instead of 18 months&apos;, service,(c) a TO-caKualnatlon of the outfit allowances and allowances for marpiod officers ofthe rank of oaptain and below.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR AIR agreed that some increase should be made in the emoluments of junior officers.He thought it would be helpful if promotion from pilotofficer to flying officer could take place after 6 months&apos;,instead of 12 months&apos;, service.    Consideration might also begiven to the grant of increased allowances for marriedofficers with children.    It was also felt as a grievance thatwhen married officers were posted to stations where they uadto live apart from their families, the allowances which they received in .respect of their families was reduced.In the R.A.F. there was little or no pressure forincreased pay for other ranks.    If, however, any increases were granted to officers,    it would be necessary to give someincreases to the men.    He would be disposed to suggest anincrease in basic rates, starting at 1/- a day for the lowestranks and tapering off to 6d.  a day for sergeants..   THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY said that there was little pressure for increased pay for naval ratings.    His mainanxiety concerned the junior officers, on whose behalf he hadalready submitted to the Treasury,    He had not^.however, had an opportunity of going into these matters indetail before the meeting, and he was not in a position toexpress any final vie^&apos;.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER recalled the courseof the discussions leading up to the increases granted inFebruary, 1942;    and stressed thefact that, when thoseconcessions were made, it had been comtemplated that nofurther increases would be granted for some considerable timeto come.    The only material change in circumstances had beenthe arrival of some, and the impending arrival of very many more, U,S.  troops in this country.    It was true that thiswould throw into prominence the great disparity between british and American rates of pay.    But, whatever increaseswe made, we could not hope to compete with American rates.It had been suggested that arrangements should be made forsome substantial part of the pay of American soldiers to beretained in the United States.    Discussion with the U.S.Ambassador had shown that there was little hope of gettingthis done by means of any compulsory arrangements;    butexperience had shown that a high proportion of the american troops in Northern Ireland were, in practice, arranging fora substantial part of their pay to be retained in the UnitedStates for the benefit of their dependants.    arrangements were also being concerted with the American militaryauthorities to mitigate some of the effects of the disparity between British and American rates of pay - e. g. by the issueof U. S, Army orders prohibiting American troops from buyingin the United Kingdom articles which were in short&apos;supply.He had taken certain steps to test the strengthof feeling on this subject in the House of Commons.   his conclusion was that, in the main, this was an agitationengineered by a small number of Members&quot;, who were not &quot;lifcelyto command any large Volume of support.The case , or increases was based mainly on the agitation in the Press and the unsettling effect this was having on men in the Services.- He asked whether this was asufficient ground on which to base increases involvingsubstantial expenditure, which would in all probabilityinvolve a continuing commitment for some time after theend of the war.,

In conclusion, he referred to the prevailingmisapprehensions about the value of Service emoluments(including quarters, rations, clothing and allowances) ascompared with industrial rates of wages;   and to the factthat few people realised the substantial advantagesresulting from the concessions made to Service personnel in respect of Income Tax*After heading these views, the War cabinet decided as follows:-(l)   The answer to the Parliamentary question should be on the following lines: -The Leader of the House had indicated that facilities would be given to theHouse to debate Service pay and allowances after the Recess.    in preparation for this debate, and witha view to removing uncertainties andmisapprehensions which seemed to be widespread, His Majesty1s government proposed to issue a White Paper whichwould contain the material necessaryto enable a judgment to be reached onthis matter,(2)    Since this White Paper would deal with the pay and allowances of all three Services,the answer should be given by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.,(3)   A draft White Pax^er, which would cover the pay and allowances of gun:kr officers, as wellas of other ranks, should oe prepared by theService Ministers and the Chancellor of theExchequer, in consultation, and should besubmitted in draft to the War Cabinet,Great George Street, S.w.1.Copies circulated to -Chancellor of the Exchequer.First Lord of the Admiralty.Secretary of State for War.Secretary of State for Air.Permanent Secretary to the   Treasury.
