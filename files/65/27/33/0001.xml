GeneralSituation.(previous reference:W.M. (42)Conclusions,Minute 6.)India. 1.   The War Cabinet were given the latest information regarding the state of public order in India. The general situation had continued to improve, and in Bihar, which was now the onlyarea giving cause for serious anxiety, order had been restored inmost parts of the Province.W M (42) 113th - ^reference was made to a recent telegram from the GovernmentConclusions D^ kndia, Home Department (No. 6664 of the 23rd August),suggesting that the disorders had not been organised by Congressalone, and that to some extent they might be attributable to agenciesworking directly for the Japanese. If this could be established, thefacts should be made known.In this connection it was suggested that urgent attention should be given to the development of a more progressive social andindustrial policy in India. Under present conditions discontentwith social and industrial conditions was being exploited- for political purposes, and this type of exploitation could best be countered by a positive policy for improving those conditions. Byway of illustration, reference was made to the low level of wages paid to Lascar seamen.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for India (i) To obtain, and report to the War Cabinet, the con-sidered view of the Government of India on theextent to which the recent disorders might havebeen provoked by agencies working directly onbehalf of the enemy.(ii) To submit to the War Cabinet a report on the consul-tations now proceeding regarding the pay andconditions of Lascar seamen, and the possibility ofproviding the Government of India with furtherexpert assistance in the formulation of social andindustrial policy.The War Cabinet had before them an exchange of telegrams between the Viceroy and the Secretary of State for India (telegramsNo. 2504-S of the 19th August and No. 1026 of the 21st August)regarding the functions of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council and proposals for appointing unofficial advisers in Provinces adminis-tered under Section 93 of the Government of India Act.The Secretary of State for India drew attention to a latertelegram from the Viceroy (No. 2558-S, dated the 22nd August)from which it appeared that the question of unofficial advisers inthe Provinces could not with advantage be discussed until certain further consultations had been held in India.The War Cabinet-(iii) Deferred consideration of these questions.Viceroy&apos;sExecutiveCouncil, andunofficialadvisers to -ProvincialGovernors.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 107thConclusions,Minute 5.)detention of Gandhi.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 113thConclusions,Minute 8.)Attention was drawn to a telegram (No. 2385-S, dated the12th August) in which the Viceroy stated that Srivastava was ofopinion that, if Gandhi started a &quot; fast unto death,&quot; he should beheld in detention, whatever the consequences. The Viceroy addedthat he felt sure that all the Moslem. members of his ExecutiveCouncil would take the same view.It was pointed out that the Viceroy&apos;s telegrams had left theWar Cabinet under the impression that his advisers, almost without exception, were strongly of the opinion that in no circumstances should Gandhi be allowed to die while under detention. It now appeared that among the members of the Executive Council opinionon this important question was more divided than the War cabinet had. been led to suppose. It was, unfortunate that the viceroy should not have made this clear at the material time.   .
The Secretary of State for India said that he had not yet received the Viceroy&apos;s reply to the further enquiry which had beenput to him regarding the conditions of Gandhi&apos;s detention, inpursuance of the decision reached by the War Cabinet on the17th August.The War Cabinet-(iv) Took note of this statement.Machinery of 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theGovernment. Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (42) 297) suggesting that a small Committeeof Ministers, under the Chairmanship of the Lord President of the. Council, should be set up to enquire into the existing machinery and management of Executive Government and to advise on what changes would be needed to enable the Government to discharge its functions most efficiently in the years which follow the war.In discussion, general agreement was expressed with the viewthat an enquiry on the lines proposed should be undertaken. Thescope of the enquiry would be broadly similar to that covered by theHaldane Committee. It would relate to central Government andnot local Government, though it would review the relations between central and local Government, and might also consider such issues as devolution from central to local or regional authorities.It was also generally agreed that it would be inappropriate to entrust to an outside body, whose report would be published, an enquiry into the Central Machinery of Government. The enquiry should be carried out under the direction of Ministers, who shouldbe free to call upon persons whose experience would be of value toassist them in particular parts of the field. They would, of course,have the assistance of a small Secretariat.The War Cabinet-Agreed in principle with the proposal in the Lord privy seal&apos;s Memorandum that an enquiry should be undertakeninto the Machinery of Government by a small Committeeof Ministers, say, three or five in number, the personnel ofthe Committee being settled by the Prime Minister.3. The War Cabinet considered whether, after the PrimeMinisters return, there would be a demand that Parliament should meet before the date already fixed, namely, the 8th September. Sofar, there had been no particular pressure for an earlier meeting.The view of the War Cabinet was that any suggestion for ameeting of Parliament before the 8th September should be answered by pointing out that it would be unreasonable to ask thePrime Minister to address Parliament immediately on his return,unless there was some special reason for this course; and that it seemed unlikely -that there was much that could be added to thepublic announcements already made about his visits to Moscow andthe Middle East.Great George Street, S.
