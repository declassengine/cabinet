Parliament.Debate on the -shipping situation.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 86thConclusions,Minute 6.)The War Cabinet had a further discussion on the questionwhether the forthcoming debate on the shipping situation shouldtake place in Public or in Secret Session.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) In the statement on business the following day the lord privy Seal should announce that there would be a debate on the shipping situation on Thursday, the 16th July,and should state that, after full consideration, theGovernment had decided that it would not be in thepublic interest that this debate should take place in public Session. He should make it clear that thisdecision had been reached not through any lack ofconfidence in our ability to deal with the situation, but because it was impossible to do full justice to theposition unless the debate was held in Secret Session.(2) At the outset of the debate on the 16th July, when theHouse had moved into Secret Session, the Lord privy seal should make an opening statement on proceduregiving the full reasons why the Government thought itnecessary that the debate should be held in secret.The substantive debate would then be opened by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty, and the reply to the debate would be made by the Joint Parliamentary Secretary tothe Ministry of War Transport (Sir Arthur Salter).(3) Exact figures of shipping losses would not be disclosed inthe debate. Similarly, while an indication should begiven of the volume of shipbuilding carried out, thisshould be done without giving detailed figures of newnaval construction. Thus, either globular figures shouldbe given, or the balance between losses and new buildings should be stated in general terms.Great George Street, S. W. 1,July 9, 1942.
OflT SECRET - NO CIRCULATION.WAR CABINET 89 (42) .(8th July, 1942, 10 p.m.)organisation OP The War Cabinet had an informal discussion on thePRODUCTION.     organisation of war production.THE MINISTER   OP PRODUCTION read, to the War cabinet a Minute which he had sent to the Prime Minister,proposing two measures:    first, a re-definition and extension of his functions;    secondly, a re-groupingof the functions of the Ministry of Supply.In regard to the latter, there was general agreement that this re-grouping was desirable, and that RawMaterials, Machine Tools, etc., should, be assigned to aseparate Ministry.The procedure proposed was that the Minister ofProduction should see Sir Andrew Duncan and. tell him that, as the result of his experience of the working ofthe existing organisation, and. having in mind particularly the need for close contact with the United. states authorities on Raw Material questions, he   was proposing to submit a recommendation to the Prime Minister for are-grouping of functions.   Thereafter the Prime minister would, himself see Sir Andrew Duncan and. discuss the matter with him.As regards the proposed re-definition of the Ministerof Production&apos;s functions, the general view taken wasthat it was better to proceed, not by way of a paperconstitution, but by a gradual building up of the Ministerof Production&apos;s powers.   One method might be for theMinister to bring before the War Cabinet a number of cases in which there was a difference of opinion.   This might-be expected to result in more speedy settlements being reached in regard to matters on which discussions with departments were at present apt to continue over a periodof two or three weeks.   The organisation for tank produc-tion might be dealt with in this way.   But it would bebetter to leave this question over until the re-distribu-tion of functions had been settled.In the course of discussion THE MINISTER OP PRODUCTIONmade clear that his difficulty was that the powers whichhe enjoyed in fact did not correspond with the responsi-bilities for production which the War Cabinet and. Parlia-ment believed him to possess.   He did. not base his easeon any inability to get Ministers and. Departments to accept this views.   This had not happened.   But the processes ofdiscussion, etc., necessary before agreement was reached,were extremely protracted and were not conducive to the efficient or expeditious conduct of business.Great George Street, S.W.I.
