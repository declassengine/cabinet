(42) 102ndConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (42) 365) covering thedraft of a White Paper in which the pay and other emoluments&apos;.of men in the Armed Forces were stated in terms in which theycould be related to the wages of civilian workers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that, in discussions of Service - pay and allowances, comparisons with industrialearnings were often drawn in such a way as to misrepresent thereal value of the Serviceman&apos;s emoluments. For example,insufficient account was taken of the remuneration received in kind,allowances to dependants, and relief from income tax; and there,was also a tendency to compare the basic pay of a raw recruitwith that of a civilian who had spent many years in industry.The White Paper attempted to assess these and other factors which should be taken into account when comparing the financialposition of men in the Services with that of civilian workers.In discussion, it was suggested that the White Paper wenttoo far in the direction of drawing a comparison between the realincomes of the Serviceman and the civilian. It would be better to adhere more closely to the line of argument set out inthe second paragraph of the draft, namely that (for the reasonsindicated) no real comparison could fairly be made between thetwo classes since the two systems of remuneration differed infundamentals. The White Paper should therefore take the formof a factual statement of the factors to be taken into account in assessing tlhe real value of Service pay and allowances. No directcomparison should be made with the cash wages of workers in civilian employment, but the White Paper should; show that thetotal emoluments of typical ranks in the Services were equivalentto a cash income in civil life greatly in excess of the cash paymentreceived by those ranks in the form of pay.The War Cabinet endorsed this view, and&apos;agreed that the. White Paper should be recast on these lines.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security reminded the War Cabinet that any increase in Service pay and allowancesmust be expected to have repercussions on the pay of members ofthe Civil Defence Services. He would welcome a further opportunity of examining the draft of the White Paper from thispoint of view. ., The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to consider certaindetailed suggestions for the amendment of the draft made in discussion. . .
FightingFrance.participation in preparations for operations in France.NorthernIreland.Death sentencespassed on six members of theI.E.A.2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Foreign Secretary (W.P. (42) 349) regarding the repre-sentations recently made by General de Gaulle urging the participation of the Fighting French in preparations for operations in France.The discussion and the conclusions reached are recordedthe Secretary^ Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.in. Reference was made to a case in which six young men had been convicted in Belfast, and sentenced to death, for the murder of a police constable. The case was still subject to appeal;but Mr. de Valera had already expressed the hope that the prisoners would be reprieved, and the Eire Minister in the UnitedStates had made similar representations to the United StatesGovernment.(A record of the War Cabinet&apos;s discussion has been circulatedto the Ministers directly concerned.)The War Cabinet-(1) Decided that there were no sufficient grounds to warrantUnited Kingdom Ministers tendering any advice to theGovernor of Northern Ireland regarding the exerciseof the prerogative of. mercy in this case,. (2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion r Affairs toinform the High &quot;Commissioner for Eire accordingly.Great George Street, S.W. 1.August 20, 1942.The War Cabinet proceeded to consider the attitude to betaken by the Government in the forthcoming debate on this subject in the House of Commons. It was suggested that the Governmentshould take the line that the matter would be reviewed in the lightof the views expressed in the debate. This, it was agreed, wouldbe appropriate if the Government were prepared to contemplate any increase, but not otherwise. If it was thought that there wasno case on the merits for any increase, it would be preferable forthe Government to make it clear, in the course of the debate, thatthis was their considered view of the position. A further reviewof the merits should, therefore, be undertaken without delay.The conclusions of the War Cabinet were as follows : (1) The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with theLord Privy Seal and the Home Secretary, should recastthe draft White Paper on the lines suggested in thecourse of the discussion, and should also incorporate the detailed amendments which had been put forward.The Service Ministers should be given an opportunityto see the revised draft. The White Paper should beready for publication at the end of the following week.(2) The question whether there was any case, on merits, for increases in Service pay or allowances should be examined forthwith by the Lord Presidents Committee.
