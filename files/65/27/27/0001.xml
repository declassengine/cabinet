The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War Cabinetthe latest information in regard to the progress of the Malta convoyvH.M.S. Eagle, an aircraft-carrier, had been sunk by a U-boaton the previous afternoon. So far, over 900 out of perhaps 1,200officers and ratings on board had been reported as saved.One enemy U-boat had been sunk and another damaged.The Admiralty&apos;s normal policy was to endeavour to inform thenext-of-kin of a ship&apos;s company before announcing the loss of a ship. Accordingly, when, on the previous night, the german wireless had announced the sinking of H.M.S. Eagle, the Press hadbeen asked not to publish the German claim in order to avoidcausing unnecessary concern. One newspaper, however, haddisregarded this request and had announced the loss that morning.The Admiralty had therefore issued a statement to the Press that afternoon explaining their general policy in this matter. Therewere indications that certain other newspapers might now join incriticising the Admiralty practice. The First Lord said that theBoard of Admiralty saw no reason whatsoever to vary the general practice, as set out above, save where there were special circum-stances. Examples were the H.M.S. Ark Royal, when it had been known that there had been only one casualty, and the loss ofH.M.S. Prince of Wales and H.M.S.

3. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretaryof State for Burma (W.P. (42) 346) coyering a Memorandum by theGovernor of Burma outlining the urgent problems of reconstructionwhich would have to be dealt with after our reoccupation of Burma.The Deputy Prime Minister said that the War Cabinet would welcome an opportunity of hearing from Sir Reginald DormanSmith.some account of the problems which would have to be faced in Burma after reoccupation, although it would be premature toreach any decisions that afternoon on the proposals set out in theMemorandum.Sir Reginald Dorman Smith gave the War Cabinet a forecast of the main tasks of reconstruction, political, economic and social,which would have to be undertaken after the Japanese had beenevicted from Burma. These tasks could not be undertaken by the burmese, and it would be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto resort to a system of direct rule during the period of reconstruc-tion. This would be an interim arrangement, which would not prejudice the subsequent fulfilment of our pledge to grant full self-government to Burma; and provision should be made for theGovernor to consult Burman opinion during this interval throughadvisory bodies appointed for that purpose.The Governor recognised that the War Cabinet could not beexpected at this stage to give firm decisions on the points raised inhis Memorandum. He would, however, be glad to know whetherthe War Cabinet approved his general approach to this problem,and whether he had their authority to embark on a study of recon-struction questions immediately after his return to India.In discussion, it was suggested that, while ,firm governmentwould be required during the period of reconstruction, the resump-tion of direct rule might be thought to imply some intention to go back on our pledge to grant full self-government to Burma. Itmight be preferable that during this interim period the powers ofgovernment should be entrusted to a small Commission, which could include one or two BUrmans.The War Cabinet-Invited Sir Reginald Dorman Smith to arrange forstudies to be undertaken, under his direction, of the tasks of reconstruction which would have to be undertaken overthe whole range of administration in Burma after theeviction of the Japanese. When these studies had beencarried to a point at which specific proposals could be formulated, these should be submitted through theSecretary of State for Burma for consideration by theWar Cabinet.India. 4.   Further reference was made to the sensational character(Previous of the news reports regarding the state of public order in India.Reference:        Though the extent of the disorder was relatively small, it was beingW.M. (42) 109th reported in such a way as to give the impression that there was conclusions,      widespread rioting throughout the whole of India.Minute 7.) Particular reference was made to the prominence given to areport suggesting that in Bombay whipping was to be widely used as a punishment for arson, rioting or personal violence.The War Cabinet-- Invited the Secretary of State for India-(i) To ascertain to what extent it was proposed to resort to whipping as a punishment for offences againstpublic order.
(ii) To  make  further. strong  representations  to . theGovernment of India regarding the need forsecuring that Press representatives in India would exercise greater discretion in the messages sent abroad, and to ascertain what further action the.Government of India proposed to take in thismatter.(iii) To make arrangements, in consultation with the lord privy Seal and the Minister of Information, for ameeting to be held with the editors of newspapersin this country with a view to impressing on them the need for greater discretion in publishing reportsof disorders in India.Great George Street, S.W. 1,August 12,1942.
