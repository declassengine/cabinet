No reports of the fighting had been received.The Russians had been attacking during the past week on the sector from Rzhev to Orel, but there was no confirmation of theRussian claim to have penetrated to a depth of 30 miles on a 75-milefront In the Stalingrad sector Russian resistance had stiffened.The Germans were estimated to be 20 miles from Stalingrad in thewest, but had made no progress in their attack on the town from thesouth-west. . .In the Caucasus the Germans had advanced in the direction ofGrozny and Novorossisk, but had made no progress towards Tuapse.There had been a certain amount of infiltration over the mainCaucasus range by small parties of the enemy, working up ravines,goat tracks, &amp;c.The latest information was given regarding the situation in new Guinea (where the Japanese had landed at Milne Bay) and the solomon Islands. No news had been received from Nauru andOcean Islands since the 25th August, and they might have been occupied by the Japanese.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements:The Royal 2.   The Prime Minister said that, with the approval of theAustralian ( War Cabinet, the 8-inch-gun cruiser Shropshire had been offeredNavy. to the Australian Government, to take the place of the Canberra.No operational conditions were attached to this offer.Mr., Bruce said that the Home Government&apos;s offer would be,greatly appreciated in Australia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal- events of thelast week.     .Night raids had been carried out against Cassel andNuremberg. The enemy had made 56 sorties over this country. Thetotal figure of enemy losses had been 14 destroyed, 10 probable and22 damaged. Our losses had been 14 fighters, 64 bombers and5 Coastal Command aircraft.Air fighting on the Egyptian front had increased in intensity.We had scored nits on some enemy merchant vessels.Twenty-seven enemy aircraft had been destroyed in the Pacifictheatre of operations.The Secretary of State for A ir undertook to furnish the PrimeMinister with information on the proposal to convert approximately200 Lancaster bombers to troop-carriers over the ensuing eighteen months.Naval Merchant shipping losses during the past week had amountedOperations. to 100,000 tons. This figure included 6,000 tons on account ofShipping Losses, probable losses and 5,000 on account of belated reports.Operations During July and August 17 U-boats had been destroyed foragainst U-boats, certain (including 3 by the United States Navy) and 6 probably destroyed (including 1 by the United States Navy).
Air Raids.Damage and casualties.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 103rdConclusions,Minute 2.) -- 3. TKe Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat on Friday, Saturday and Sunday there had been daylight raids on Bristol, Swindon and Chelmsf ord by high-flying aircraft. In the raid on Bristol 41 people had been killed and 28 seriously injured,two buses having been gutted, with passengers trapped inside,In discussion, it was stated that, although nO figures of casulties had been quoted, the publication in the Press of the factthat two buses had been destroyed and passengers trapped insidemust have given the enemy a fairly good idea of the success achieved by this isolated raider. This could be avoided, e.g., by summarising the results of several raids in one communique.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.northernIreland.DeathSentences.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 114thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Northern Ireland Government had commuted the death sentence of five out of the six young men who had been convicted in belfast for the murder of a police constable. Mr. de Valera had now sent a personal message to the Prime Minister begging him to intervene on behalf of the sixth man.The War Cabinet- *Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to reply to Mr. de Valera to the effect that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, having given the fullest consideration to allthe relevant circumstances, regretted that the case was not one in which they could intervene.Turkey. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention(Previous to telegram No. 1600 from our Ambassador at Ankara, reporting ohReference: the position in Turkey and dealing, inter alia, with the supply of w.M. (42) 118th munitions to that country.conclusions minute 2.)The War Cabinet-Postponed discussion of this matter pending the sub-mission of a Report which had been called for from theChiefs of Staff.United states forces.coloured troops.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 109thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it seemed that the United States authorities were still sending overthe full authorised proportion of coloured troops (about 10 percent.) with the contingents of forces reaching this country. Havingregard to the various difficulties to which this policy was likely togive rise (including the fact that the health of coloured troops wouldbe likely to suffer during the English winter), he thought that wewere justified in pressing the United States authorities to reduceas far as possible the number of coloured troops included in thecontingents of United States forces sent to this country.This view was endorsed by the War Cabinet.China.Air Support.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 102ndConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theForeign Secretary (W.P. (42) 375) covering a telegram from theMilitary Attache- at Chungking urging the importance of building up a small Allied Air Force in China. The Foreign Secretary, inhis Memorandum, while recognising the difficulties which made itimpossible at the present time to send British aircraft to China,emphasised that General Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s ability to keep up the morale of his people depended largely On the evidence which hecould provide of support for the Chinese war effort by ourselves and
China.Financial Aid.(previous reference:8. The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(W.P. (42) 370) recapitulating the course of the Loan negotiations.These had now reached a deadlock, the Chinese Government beingWM 7421102nd unwiUing to sign the agreement on our terms.Conclusions,Minute 4.)China could not, in present circumstances, make use of foreign exchange, and the concession asked for would therefore be of no practical benefit to her during the war. It was out of the question for us to lend large sums to China for use after the war, in view ofthe difficulties we should have in maintaining equilibrium in our balance of payments. To give way now would be of no practicalvalue to China, and would, moreover, be regarded as a sign of weakness.The War Cabinet took note of this Memorandum.India.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 117thConclusions,Minute 1.)GeneralSituation.Detention of gandhi.9. The Prime Minister expressed gratification at the firmnesswith which the Government of India had dealt with the situationin India. The limited response to the revolutionary campaign ofthe Congress Party had provided a practical demonstration that congress did not represent the masses of the Indian people.In this connection reference was again made to the suggestionthat urgent attention should be given to the development of a moreprogressive social and industrial policy in India (W.M. (42)117th Conclusions, Minute 1). -The War Cabinet invited the Secretary of State for Indiato draw the Governor-General&apos;s attention to the general feeling of the War Cabinet that the Governments in Indiamight with advantage give early consideration to thesequestions.The Secretary of State for India said that a further telegram(No. 2648-S of the 29th August) about the conditions of Gandhi&apos;sdetention had now been received from the Viceroy. He wished toobtain further information from the Viceroy on one point (freedom to receive visitors from outside) and would then bring the matter,before the War Cabinet. - ...The War Cabinet took note of this statement.the United States. The Foreign Secretary recommended that air reinforcements should be sent to China at the earliest possible moment and to the greatest possible extent to which they could bemade available.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Chief of the AirStaff had sent a telegram to Air Marshal Peirse, in India, urginghim to consider whether any possible means could be found wherebywe could send a squadron to China. It was believed, however, thatthe ground facilities available in China made it impossible to operate any air forces in excess of those already in the country.The general view of the War Cabinet was that thedespatch of a single British squadron from India to Chinawould have a political value out of all proportion to the sacrifice involved, and that every effort should be made tosend a squadron from India to China.
Indian Army.Powers ofIndian Officers6ver British&apos;service personnel.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 96thConclusions,Minute 7.)10. The War Cabinet gave further consideration to theproposal that Indian Commissioned Officers should be granted thesame powers of punishment over British personnel as thosepossessed by Indians holding King&apos;s Commissions.In addition to the original Memorandum W.P. (42) 307, theWar Cabinet had before them a further Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (W.P. (42) 369) containing the particulars for which the War Cabinet had asked when thisproposal was previously discussed.   This showed that: r(i) There Were about 200 King&apos;s Commissioned indian officers, and the number of Indian commissioned officers serving in units including British as well asIndian personnel was at present about 800;(ii) It was impossible to estimate how many IndianCommissioned Officers were likely in the near future tobe in positions in which they would, if they held King&apos;commissions, exercise powers of punishment; and(iii) The change proposed would not involve any legislation in this country, but legislation in India would benecessary in the case of the Air Force.The Secretary of State for India said that, while the numbersof officers affected was small, he still attached great importance tothe question of principle involved. He again drew attention tothe views expressed by the Viceroy and the Commander-in-chief in India, and urged that these powers of punishment should nolonger be withheld from Indian Commissioned Officers.The Secretary of State for War said that, while he agreedthat this concession would ultimately have to be made, he remainedof opinion that this was an inopportune moment for such a change.The War Cabinet:-    .(1) Decided that the balance of advantage lay on the side of granting to Indian Commissioned Officers the powersof punishment over British personnel which are now exercised by King&apos;s Commissioned Indian Officers.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to arrange forthe necessary amendment to be made in King&apos;sRegulations.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for India to arrange forthe introduction, in the Indian Legislature, of thelegislation necessary to enable this change to be madein the Air Force.Home Front. 11.   The War Cabinet took note of a Report by the MinisterPublicity Policy Qf Information (W.P. (42) 385) on the state of public opinion in(Previous this country.Reference:W.M.
