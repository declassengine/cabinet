AtVoronezh Russian counter-attacks continued. In the Stalingradarea Russian attacks from the north of the city had contributed tothe slowing up of enemy progress in Stalingrad itself.Our forces had entered Tananarive on the 23rd September.The population was quiet and life was returning to normalconditions.Reference was made to a suggestion by General Chiang Kai-shek that some 8,000 Chinese troops should be flown into India, ifthe necessary transport was available.The War Cabinet expressed the view that, on politicalgrounds, this proposal was likely to be disadvantageous,and should be discouraged unless it would be in ourinterests on military grounds.Persia.(PreviousReference :W.M. (42) 91stConclusions,Minute 3.)Civil Defence.Proposedcelebration on15th November,1942.2. The War Cabinet had a discussion, a record of which iscontained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War CabinetConclusions, about a proposal to establish certain bases in NorthernPersia.3. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityinformed the War Cabinet that it was proposed to celebrate thesecond anniversary of the Civil Defence of Great Britain againstthe &quot; blitz &quot; of 1940-41 by a celebration which would take placeon the 15th November and which would include religious servicesand local parades. In particular, it was proposed that there shouldbe a National Parade, with token contingents from heavily blitzedareas, and that His Majesty should be asked to take the salute at themarch-past.The War Cabinet gave their general approval to thearrangements suggested.[24414]
4. The War Cabinet had before them a MemorandumHome Secretary (W.P. (42) 427) recommending that admission tothis country should be given to Jewish children, and to persons over60, refugees from unoccupied France, who had close relativesalready in this country. The Jewish Refugee Committee hadguaranteed that there would be no question of these personsbecoming a charge on public funds. The Home Secretary proposedthat, if this policy was approved by the War Cabinet, all furtherconcessions of this nature should thereafter be refused.After discussion, the War Cabinet reached the followingConclusions : (1) Admission to this country of Jewish refugees from.unoccupied France should be limited to children who hada parent (or parents) already in this country, subject tothe Home Secretary having discretion also to admitorphan children who had a near relation, e.g., uncle, auntor grandparent in this country.(2) The above decision should be applied, on strictly analogousprinciples, to children of Allied nationals.(3) Special measures should be taken to remove from Gibraltaras soon as possible some 250 persons who had made theirway there from enemy-occupied territory.Refugees.Jewish Refugeesfrom France.(PreviousReference:W.M. (42) 126thConclusions,Minute 5.)The FightingServices.Pay andAllowances.(PreviousReference:W.M. (42) 121stConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The War Cabinet were informed that in certain quartersit seemed to be doubted whether the Government intended to adhereto the decisions announced in the House on the 10th Septemberabout Service Pay and Allowances. If it was made known at anearly date that the Government intended to adhere to the decisionsalready announced, subject to the adjustment of any anomalies, itwas likely that opinion would harden in favour of acceptance of theGovernments decisions. Otherwise there was a risk that agitationwould continue for further increases.Reference was also made to a request which had been made tothe Prime Minister that he should receive a Deputation on thissubject.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that the decisions announced in theHouse on the 10th September should be adhered to,subject only to the adjustment of anomalies, in regardto which it might be desirable that a statement shouldbe made in Parliament at a later date.(2) Agreed that, if the request for a deputation to be receivedby the Prime Minister was pressed, the reply should bethat a deputation would be received, by a group of theMinisters concerned, but not by the Prime Minister.GovernmentContracts.Report by theComptroller andAuditor-General.(PreviousReference:W.M.

Report of the Public Accounts Committee oncertain contract cases which had been criticised in the Report ofthe Comptroller and Auditor-General, together with the actionwhich had been, taken by the Departments concerned in accordancewith the Committee&apos;s recommendations.The War Cabinet took note of this Memorandum, andagreed that a White Paper should be presented to Parlia-ment, setting out the action taken by Departments on theCommittee&apos;s Report, before the Debate which had beenarranged for Wednesday, the 7th October.
