Parliament. 1.   The War Cabinet were informed that, after the PrimeDebate on Ministers statement.on India in the House of Commons that.day,India, a Motion on the subject had been handed in bv a number of Conser-(Previous vative Members who thought it undesirable that this matter shouldWMf^l22 d ke debated on Adjournment on the following day. If, in theConclusions f statement on Business on the following day, the government announced their readiness to find time for a formal Debate on Indiashortly after the House reassembled, the Speaker would be pre-cluded (by the rules regarding anticipation of future business) fromallowing a discussion on India to take place on the Motion for the adjournment.Mr. Whiteley said that there was a strong feeling amongLabour Members that, if this happened, they would have been deprived by a trick of their opportunity to debate Indian questions on the Adjournment as they had intended to do. He had hoped thatthe Prime Minister&apos;s statement would have made it possible toavoid a discussion of Indian questions on the Adjournment; but,in view of the situation which had arisen, he thought it would nowbe most inexpedient to try to postpone any discussion of thesequestions until after the House reassembled. He was satisfied thatit would be possible to arrange for a balanced Debate to take placeon the following day; and, even though there could be no Division,it could be arranged that speakers would be called who fairlyrepresented the main sections of opinion in the House.It was pointed out that, if, contrary to expectations, the debate on the Adjournment proved unsatisfactory, it would bepossible for the Government to put down a Motion and to hold,immediately after the House reassembled, a formal Debate, at theend of which a Division could be taken.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : -(1) As both the Prime Minister and the Lord Privy Seal had held out expectations that Indian questions could bediscussed on the Adjournment, if the House so desired,it would be wrong for the Government to take any step which would prevent those expectations from beingfulfilled.(2) In the circumstances which had arisen, it wras preferable that a Debate on India should take place on the adjournment, but steps should be taken to secure a properly balanced discussion.(3) The Government had also undertaken, however, to find timefor a more formal Debate on India after the Housereassembled, and it was undesirable that this under-taking should be withdrawn.(4) In the statement on Business the following day, therefore,reference should be made to the possibility of a Debateafter the Recess, but this should be done in terms whichwould not&apos; preclude the Speaker from allowing a discussion On India to take place on the Adjournment,e.g., it might be said that the Government &quot;will beprepared to provide an opportunity for a Debate on a motion at some future date depending on conditions inIndia.&quot;(5) The Chief Whip should explain the position to theMembers who had tabled the Motion.
Sir WalterCitrine.Proposed visit to UnitedStates.2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto a report of a speech made that day at the meeting of the TradesUnion Congress at Blackpool, in which Sir Walter Citrine was alleged to nave said that His Majesty&apos;s Government had advised the Trades Union Congress not to send a delegation to the UnitedStates, and to have added that on this account he &quot;no longer had any confidence in the people advising the British Government in washington.&quot;The Foreign Secretary said that, subject to the views of theWar Cabinet, he proposed to make a statement in the House ofCommons on the following day defending Lord Halifax against this criticism and pointing out that on such industrial questions as these the Ambassador had the advice of Professor Tawney andMr. Harold Butler.The War Cabinet approved the terms of the statement which the Foreign Secretary proposed to make on thismatter.Great George Street, S.W. 1,September 11, 1942.
