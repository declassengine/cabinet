The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.Bomber Command had attacked Hamburg, Saarbrucken andDiisseldorf, the two latter raids being particularly successful.Escorted day-bombing attacks had been made on aerodromes andother targets in Northern France.Coastal Command had torpedoed one ship and hit three others.There had been 15 attacks on U-Boats, 9 of which were claimed tohave been damaged.The enemy had made a number of small-scale night attacks onthis country. Of 300 aircraft sent over, our night fighters had brought down 21 and our A.A. batteries 8.During the previous eight days, the total enemy losses had been68 aircraft for certain, 15 probable and 59 damaged. We had lost42 fighters, 75 bombers, 9 Coastal Command aircraft and 2 army co-operational aircraft.There had been a slight increase in enemy action. The enemy had lost 25 aircraft for certain, 7 probable and 16 damaged. Wehad lost 11 aircraft destroyed and 8 damaged.There had been a slight decrease in air activity on our side.Enemy losses had been 13 aircraft destroyed, 2 probable and10 damaged.   We had lost 22 aircraft destroyed and 11 damaged.Shipping losses during the past week amounted to 30,349 tons for certain.  This figure might be increased by 17,000 tons.Our total losses for July- amounted to 576,000 tons, to which97,000 tons might have to be added. These figures included our losses in the Russian convoy.There had been some activity in the English Channel, where we had sunk 5 enemy light craft.Two U-boats had been sunk by the escort of an atlantic convoy.Since our attack the previous week there had been littleground activity and both sides had resumed patrolling. Theenemy&apos;s administrative situation was probably causing him anxietyowing to our air and naval action.The Miri oil wells were now being operated by the Japanese.At Voronezh there had been a short lull. The Russians had attacked to the north-west, but with little territorial success. On theUpper Don there had been little activity. In the Stalingrad sectorthere had been considerable German pressure towards the south, butnorth-west of Kalach the Russians had offered some resistance andthe Germans had made little progress. The Russians had succeeded in preventing the enemy from enlarging their bridgeheadover the Don at Nijne Chirsk. But the Germans held both banks of the river over the 100 miles between Rostov and Tsimlyanskaya,and had succeeded in pressing south and cutting the Stalingrad-Black Sea Railway. It was&apos; possible that they had reached theRiver Kuban.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Air Raids.Damage and casualties.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 96thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat there had been considerable enemy activity throughout the past week against this country. Attacks had been widespread, but themain attacks had been concentrated against the Birmingham area.The enemy had also carried out a number of attacks during the day,making use of cloud cover. :.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.[24195]
Information. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMilitary Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (42) 320) suggestingOperations that in official communiques and Press accounts of militaryPublicity for operations the work done by United Kingdom units was still beingUnited given insufficient prominence as contrasted with that given to trooplKingdom from the Dominions and the United States.   This was especiallyTroops. noticeable in the Middle East communiques.    It had caused(Previous indignation among Dominion troops  who knew the facts, andrepresentations about it had recently been made by all the DominionW.M(42) 64th High Commissioners.Conclusions, t    j-         -       .i     * n                -  .Minute 4) discussion, the following points were raised : (a) The War Office had withdrawn, some months ago, theprevious ban on mentioning United Kingdom units by name in official communiques; and General Head-quarters, Cairo, had been reminded on several occasionsof the importance of ensuring that adequate publicitywas given to the work of United Kingdom troops. TheDirector of Public Relations at the War Office had alsostressed this point in advice given to Press representa-tives in this country.(&amp;) The general level of competence among United Kingdomwar correspondents in the Middle East was not high.The Minister of Information was doing what he could to raise the standard, but many of the better journalistshad been called up for military service,(c) There had been a tendency for war correspondents in theMiddle East to rely on getting background from themilitary spokesman in Cairo. If the essential facts,including the names of United Kingdom units partici-pating in a particular action, were included in theofficial communiques, it might be possible to induce warcorrespondents to look for illustrative material near thefront rather than in Cairo.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for War and the Ministerof Information to consider what further steps could betaken to secure a more satisfactory observance of theinstructions already issued in this matter, and to improve the standard of reports of military operations despatchedfrom the Middle East.FightingServices.Employment offtychologistsandPsychiatrists.(previous reference:W.M.

(42) 330) by the Lord Privy Seal, the First Lord of theAdmiralty, the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary ofState for Air. The conclusion reached was that there was nosubstance in the criticisms which had been made of the use ofpsychologists and psychiatrists in the Army, but that measures should be taken to co-ordinate work of this nature in the three services and to study its methods with a view to their post-warapplication.In discussion, comment was made on the complaints as to the poor quality of some of the drafts sent out to the Middle East. Insome cases units had used these drafts as a means of getting rid oftheir worst personnel, with most unfortunate and wasteful results(paragraph 22 of the Report). The Secretary of State for Warundertook to look into this matter and to consider what further steps could be taken to ensure that unit commanders no longerselected for drafts men of whom they wished to be&apos; rid.

&apos; 68SECRET. ,tDRAFT STATEMENT oh P.Q.17-   ,It is nww possible to.give some account of the recentconvey to North Russia which the enemy claimed to have practicallyannihilated.v2..      The losses which, were suffered in this convoy wereseriius, but they did not approximateto the exaggerated claimsput forward by the enemy..     The claims made by the enemy have.,  in.fact, &quot;been of such a character that it is clear that the german high Command has no knowledge of the actual facts and has beenendeavouring, by disseminating exaggerated accounts,  to extract  -information -which will enable tho claims and reports of Germanpilots and U-boat commanders to be checked.      It is intended to withhold information which would be- of value to the enemy,  such astrie number of ships which have arrived in Russia and the actuallosses sustained.3.     -The difficulties of convoying supplies to North Russiahave always been great.      The lack of sea room owing to the iceconditions in the Barents Sea;    the-perpetual daylight at this timeof the year; - .arid the existence of bases for strong enemy air andU-boat forces along the flank of the convoy route, have allcombined to confront the Royal and Merchant Navies with a formidabletask, which they have faced with great gallantry.      On this occasion there was an added enemy threat of surface attack, by heavyunits which had. moved to bases in Northern Norway.1+.      Certain dispositions to counter the enemy threats weremade.      The House will readily understand that-it is not in theCountry1s interest to disclose,  even in secret session, the operational details of these arrangements.      It can, however, besaid that special patrols by both Russian and British submarinesformed a part of these dispositions.5.      In the eventj  the passage of this convoy was normal untilthe convoy was well to the eastward of Bear Island.      For some days the convoy had been constantly shadowed by aircraft;    a number of u-boats had tried to attack,  and there, had been two attacks bytorpedo carrying aircraft.      The losses suffered by the convoyduring this period were not serious.&apos; 6.      At this stage,  as&apos; h &quot;result&apos; of aerial reconnaissance,  theinformation at the disposal of- the Admiralty led to the conclusionthat an attack on the convoy by strong German surface forces was imminent.      As the threat from surface forces was considered to be  -a greater menace than that due to U-boats or air -attack, orders were given by the Admiralty for the convoy to disperse.    cruisers and destroyers of the escort at once formed a striking fwrce withthe object of attacking the enemy- before he could reach themerchant ships.7.      An enemy force,  including the battleship TIRPITZ,  did,&apos; infact, put to sea and steered a course to intercept the convoy.Soon afterwards, however,  the TIRPITZ was attacked by a Russiansubmarine, who claimed to have hit the battleship with twotorpedoes.      The Admiralty have no information as to damage &apos;suffered by the TIRPITZ, but the enemy surface forces abandonedtheir attempt to intercept and destroy the ships of the convoy,  andthey returned to the&quot;shelter of the fiords.      This decision on thepart yf-,.these very powerful enemy forces may have&quot; been due to the&quot;dispersal of the convoy which had deprived him of a concentratedtarget or perhaps to the threat of the- allied dispositions whichcannot be discussed.

8..     The enemy decision to withdraw resulted in no contactbeing made between our surface forces and those of the enemy.9.      Unfortunately,  the losses amcng the ships of the convoydue to air attack and U-boat attack increased after the convoy hadscattered.      But as has already been stated, the eventual finallosses,  though serious, did not approximate to those claimed bythe enemy.10.      It is now possible to state that the loss of life -amongthe crews of the merchant ships was happily not nearly as heavy as might have boon expected.FOR SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS.1.      In the event *f Mr. Shinwell repeating tthe suggestionthat the Royal Navy had deserted the Convoy,  I should propose toindicate in accordance with Cabinet Minute of 1st August that thischarge had been investigated by the Government who are satisfiedthat there was no lack of care or resolution in this matter on thepart of the responsible officers.      Moreover we are convinced atthe Admiralty that the principal reason for the turning back of heavy enemy surface ships was the dispersal of the convoy togetherwith our dispositions.      If surface attack had in fact been madein the position and at the time expected the whole of the convoywould have been wiped out with very heavy loss of life.-    In fact the loss in material was heavy hut much gotthrough -which wo shall not specify, and the losses in personnelwere reduced through rescue work to;-5.6% killed&apos;1.7% wounded1.7% prisonersof the M/V personnel of the whole convoy.2.      If Mr.  Shinwell asks why British heavy forces were notin company it should be stated that our dispositions cannot bediscussed in detail but,  although British and U.S.  forces were at sea, it will he recognised that the lack of sea room owing to tieice conditions in the Barents Sea,  the perpetual daylight at this time of year,  and the existence of bases for strong enemy air andU-boat forces along the flank of the convoy route,  all combinedto make it impracticable for heavy surface forces to be kept inclose proximity with the convoy during the whole time of the convoy&apos;s passage.

- MOST SECRET--NO CIRCULATION.PHS PRIMEJINISTER&apos; SJOURNEY.W.M. (42)105.(4th AngustT 5.50 p.m*)THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that Mr Harriman, whom he had seen that morning, had recalled that thePresident had told him that he should consider himselfavailable to undertake   any mission.   Mr Harriman had asked whether it would be of assistance if he were tooffer to join the Prime Minister in Cairo and go to moscow with him.The Foreign Secretary said that he had advisedMr Harriman to put this suggestion to the President,and that he had himself passed it on to the Prime Minister^THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said   that this suggestion hadbeen mooted before the Prime Minister left, and that hehad discouraged it because he did not himself believethat Mr Harriman had established very satisfactoryrelations with Premier Stalin on the occasion of his previous visit to Moscow.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had spoken toM. Maisky that morning about the leakage of information in regard, to the Prime Minister&apos;s journey.   M. Maisky,who had been ignorant of the fact, had appeared to bemuch put out, and had been at a loss how it could be explained.   He had scouted the idea that it might havebeen due to the breaking of the Russian cypher.M. Maisky had learned with some disappointment thathe was not to return to Moscow for the Prime Minister&apos;visit.   M.Novikov was going in his place.Great George Street, S.W.I.
