Post-War 1.   The War Cabinet had before them telegrams Nos. 17, 18Belief. and 19 Relief, dated the 18th July, from Washington.   These(Previous       telegrams reported that a copy of the draft declaration on reference:      Rationing had been shown to Mr. Acheson, who had replied that.M. (42) 90th the United States authorities had been advised by AmbassadorConclusions,    Winant, in May last, that a declaration on this subject was underMinute l.)      consideration in London.   The President had then indicated that,while a parallel declaration at that time concerning the continuanceof rationing in the United States did not appear advisable, hewould be glad to make a statement at one of his Press Conferencesstrongly supporting the British declaration.    A copy of thestatement which the President had then proposed to make was contained in telegram 19 Relief.Discussion showed that a number of Ministers favouredmaking the proposed declaration at the present time, on the groundthat this would facilitate an agreement between the United nations to prevent competition for essential supplies and shippingimmediately after the war. Moreover, the declaration was calculated to make United States opinion more disposed to providehelp for the relief of post-war Europe.In any event, however, the vital point was that progressshould be made with the working out of a common plan for theinternational organisation of post-war relief; and the proposed declaration about rationing was only one ingredient in this plan.On the other hand, the view was advanced that while weshould, probably, for other reasons, have to continue rationing inthis country after the end of hostilities, there was some danger in making an announcement now, specifically linking up anundertaking on our part to continue rationing with our contributionto post-war relief. It was difficult to foresee what the positionwould be after the war j but the saving resulting from a continuanceof rationing in this country might not be a very material factor in providing the supplies required for post-war relief.It was pointed out that in the telegram despatched on the15th July, giving effect to the decisions of the War Cabinet attheir last discussion on this matter, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross hadbeen instructed to make it clear that, since His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could not entertain the proposal for continuedrationing except as part of a common plan for the inter-nationalisation of post-war relief, it followed that they could not reach a final decision on this point until they had had anopportunity of examining the plan as a. whole. The situation,therefore, did not call for the issue of any further instructionsat the present time, more especially since it had become clear (see, forexample, telegram No. 9 Relief, of the 13th July) that, in viewof the forthcoming Congressional Election, the United states administration would probably make rather slow progress withthis question in the immediate future.The War Cabinet accordingly took note of the position,and agreed that it was unnecessary to send any further instructions to Sir Frederick Leith-Ross on this matter at the present time.U.S.A.

THE PRIME MINISTER thought that his colleagues  ought to he aware   of the fact that prosecutions wereHos e cut ions .        pending in regard to   a case of Blacic Market dealingsin wheat which affected a member of the Government.The case at issue arose from   the fact that aforeman of Daniel Bros.(Whitstable) Ltd., by nameBlackman, had for a period of time been illicitlydisposing of   wheat, barley and maize.   A quantity ofthis fraudulently obtained grain had been passed to,among other firms, Messrs Thorpe, of Rye.Blackman and one of the receivers had been triedat the Old Bailey and had been bound over by the Courton the ground that it had been the practice of the trade for many years for &quot;sweepings&quot; to be appropriated.Prosecutions would be instituted against the firmof Thorpe &amp; Co.Next in the chain came the customers and other firms to whom Thorpe &amp; Co. had passed on grain.   the offence committed by the customers who had receivedthis grain was that they obtained it either without giving in exchange coupons - or an adequate number ofcoupons - in contravention of the Pood Orders.The firm of Thorpe &amp; Co. had at once given the names of four of their customers who had received grainin excess of their coupons - Sir William Jowitt,Sir Henry Courthope, Lord Burleigh and an Admiral.In discussion it was pointed out that while theMinister of Pood might properly give general directionson policy as to the kind of case in which it was desirable!that prosecutions should be instituted, it was undesirable!that he should take any part in deciding in which particu-lar cases prosecutions should be instituted.   This was amatter v/hich should be dealt with by the Director ofPublic Prosecutions, who would obtain the advice of the attorney-General so far as this was necessary or appro-priate.Some anxiety was expressed on the ground that,although it was known that Thorpe &amp; Co.   had passed onthis Black Market wheat to about twenty customers, ithad been decided, in the first instance at any rate, to institute proceedings only against the four prominentpeople referred to, and their agents, who were no doubtreally responsible for what had happened.   While, ofcourse, no special favour should be shown to these people, it seemed, equally undesirable that anybody shouldbe singled out for prosecution because they happened tobe distinguished.   The view was expressed that it shouldbe made clear to the Director of Public Prosecutionsthat the reason why these four names only had beensubmitted to him in the first instance had. beenbecause information in regard to these four people had first come to hand, and that it would be desirable that     he should look through the whole list of customers and
