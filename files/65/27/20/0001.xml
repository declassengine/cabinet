Palestine.Palestinians inthe Forces andLocal defence and PoliceServices.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 102ndConclusions,Minute 6.)X&quot;1. The War Cabinet considered a Joint Memorandum by, theSecretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for theColonies (W.P. (42) 3l2).After summarising the action taken in pursuance of theprevious decision of the War Cabinet, and the factors to be takeninto account in deciding upon future policy, the Memorandumsuggested the lines of a public Statement announcing the following measures: (1) The immediate creation of a Palestinian Regiment of theBritish Army, consisting of separate Jewish-and ArabInfantry Battalions and absorbing the existing Pales-palestinian Companies of the Buffs, and to be augmented byat least 10,000 additional recruits.(2) The expansion of the Palestine Volunteer Force, recruit-ment for which was open to all sections of thecommunity, to a maximum of, say, 2,000, as arms,equipment and training facilities could be madeavailable.(3) The completion of the establishment of the Jewish RuralSpecial Police by the enrolment of 1,500 additionalrecruits, the necessary training staff and co-ordinationofficers, arms and equipment being provided by theCommander-in-Chief, Middle East, as soon as possible.The main question dealt with in discussion was whether toadopt the Colonial Secretary&apos;s view that the public announcement should avoid a detailed explanation of the duties of the PalestineRegiment, and should merely state that it was being created &quot; forgeneral service in the Middle East &quot;; or whether the announcement should state explicitly that the role of the battalions of the PalestineRegiment should be limited to the defence of vulnerable points andthe provision of local mobile forces.The War Cabinet decided that the former view should beadopted.The War Cabinet accordingly (a) Adopted the recommendations set out in the Joint Memo-randum by the Secretaries of State for War and theColonies and summarised above.(b) Agreed that an announcement should be made on the lines suggested in paragraph 13 of the Memorandum, the viewof the Secretary of State for the Colonies, as summarised at &quot;X,&quot; being preferred to that of the Commander-in-Chief , Middle East.(c) Authorised the Secretary of State for War to communicate this decision immediately to the Commander-in-Chief,Middle East, and to make the announcement in theHouse of Commons on the following day.Middle East. 2.
