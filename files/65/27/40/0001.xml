The Prime Minister extended a warm welcome, on behalfof the War Cabinet, to H.H. the Maharaja Jam Saheb of nawanagar and Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar, the Representatives ofIndia at the War Cabinet.Malta.Egypt.naval operations.Convoy losses.Shipping Losses.Benghazi andTobruk.MilitaryOperations.Madagascar.Pacific.Egypt.Russia.2. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thelast week.&apos; Bombing raids had been carried out on Frankfurt (our path-finders had lit up Russelheim, where the Opel factory had been hit),Dusseldorf and Bremen. All three raids had achieved considerable success. 3,600 tons of bombs had been dropped during the firstfortnight of September. This was almost as much as had been dropped during the whole of August.Bombers had made two attacks on U-boats, one of which hadbeen promising. Coastal Command had made ten attacks onU-boats, five of which had been promising. The total figure of enemy aircraft losses had been 7 destroyed, 5 probably destroyed and 7 damaged. Our losses had been 10 fighters, 57 bombers and Coastal Command aircraft.United States Air Forces had carried out 81 fighter and29 bomber sorties.There had been little air activity over Malta.There had been less air activity in Egypt during the past week,but we had carried out some successful operations against enemy shipping.Twelve ships of the convoy now on its way to Russia had beenreported as lost. The First Lord of the Admiralty was asked toobtain from the Officer in Command of the convoy escort a briefreport of the action.The War Cabinet asked the Chief of the Air Staff to convey to the detachment of Coastal Command now in North Russia theWar Cabinet&apos;s appreciation of their fine achievement in completingtheir hazardous and difficult journey.An outward-bound Atlantic convoy had also been- heavily attacked and a number of ships sunk.During the previous seven days, including belated reports,76,000 tons of shipping had been sunk. This figure included four ships sunk in the Atlantic convoy, but did not include losses in theRussian convoy.In an attack on Benghazi and Tobruk the anti-aircraftcruiser Coventry had been bombed and had had to be sunk by ourown forces. One destroyer had been lost and one damaged in this operation.A Canadian destroyer, Ottawa, which had been escorting the atlantic convoy, had been torpedoed and sunk.The War Cabinet were given a summary of our recent operations in Madagascar.There had been a good deal of fighting in the Solomon Islands.United States forces held three of these islands, but not the wholeof Guadalcanal Island. In New Guinea the Japanese had landed at Buna and were working down towards Port Moresby. Australianreinforcements had been landed and should be able to deal with thesituation. .There had been no change in the situation during the past week.There had been few changes on the Russian front except atStalingrad, where German forces were now closing in on the town.In the Grosny area, and at the western end of the southern slopesof the Caucasus, German forces had been driven back.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
Allocation of 3.   In connection with the account of the recent successfulAircraft. bombing operations, some discussion took place on the allocation of(Previous aircraft for different purposes:Reference: Reference was made to the fact that the United StatesW.M. (42) llith authorities now showed a tendency to divert a larger proportion of conclusions, productive capacity to aircraft designed for co-operation with t,he Minute 2.)        Army at the expense of building up their heavy bomber programme.Reference Was also made to the discussion which had takenplace in the War Cabinet on the 12th August, 1942, on the provisionof aircraft for the war at sea.  The detailed statement asked for at&apos;  that Meeting had now been circulated (W.P. (42) 388).The Prime Minister said that he would shortly put before theWar Cabinet proposals as to the allocation of aircraft.Spain. 4. -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the(Previous replacement of Senor Sufler as Foreign Secretary in the SpanishReference: Government by General Jordana was a welcome change.

The Minister of Production said that, since the WarRussia. Cabinet considered this question on the 7th September, he had, atTransport the   Foreign   Secretary&apos;s   request,   discussed  with  the   Soviet,aircraft. Ambassador the difficulties of meeting the Russian request for(Previous transport aircraft.  He had explained that there were no transportReference: aircraft in production in this country, and only one type in large-W.M. (42) 121st scale production in the United States. He had promised, however,Conclusions, to consider whether we could make available any other types of minute 2.)        aircraft which could be used for the transport of troops.On enquiry, he had found that there were 45 Albemarlesavailable in maintenance units which in about 4 weeks could be converted to carry 20 men apiece. If further machines of this type were taken from production, we could supply to Russia20 Albemarles a month up to a total of 250.The Chief of Air Staff said that, if this demand had to be met,we could spare the Albemarles more easily than any other type of aircraft suitable for transport work. We had, however, intendedto use the Albemarles for sea rescue work and other duties on whichwe were at present using operational types which could thus be set free for operational roles. Indirectly, therefore, the transfer ofthese aircraft to Russia would be at the expense of Bomber and coastal Commands.The War Cabinet favoured in principle the proposal totransfer to Russia the 45 Albemarles now in maintenance units.: This might be regarded as an interim measure designed to give some immediate relief. But for the satisfaction of their main needs for transport aircraft the Russians should look to the United States,whose resources in this type of aircraft were substantially greaterthan our own.The.War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Production to consider whatdetailed arrangements could be made on these lines, inconsultation with the Minister of Aircraft Production, andto report to the Prime Minister.
23W,M. 124 (42).6. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (42)408) pointing out that, owing to the cessation of supplies from Burma, stocks office in Ceylon would only last, on the present restricted ration scale,until the third week in October. It was essential, for reasons bothof defence and of production, that an adequate supply of cerealsshould be made available in Ceylon. If the Government of india were unable to increase the supply of rice from India, it would benecessary to ship supplies of wheat and flour from Australia. Thiswould involve a continuing encroachment upon the shipping available for importing food to the United Kingdom.The War Cabinet also had before them a telegram on thissubject from the Viceroy, No. 277/S of the 13th September.Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar said that, in view of the militarysituation, the Government of India had readily agreed in march last that Ceylon might be treated, for purposes of the. supply office, as though it came within the Indian economy. They had hoped to be able to meet the Island&apos;s current needs of 30,000 tons of ricea month and, in addition, to send an additional supply of5,000 tons a month between March and May in order to build upstocks. In the event, however, it had proved impossible for Indiato supply the full amounts required, and shipments from April to august had averaged only 23,000 tons a month. This had been due partly to a deterioration in the shipping position, and latterlyto shortages of supply and internal transport difficulties in Indiaitself. For example, the whole of the rice crop in Sindh had been lost through flooding. It would be necessary now for the government\ment of India to take special measures to obtain supplies fromareas where there was a surplus of production. There wereexportable surpluses in Bengal and in Orissa, but supplies werenot coming forward from the rural areas on to the market.Additional supplies for Ceylon would have to be drawn mainly from Madras; and, if it were found possible to overcome theinternal transport difficulties which were at present holding upsupplies from that area, the total export to Ceylon might be workedup to a total of 30,000 tons a month. He suggested that the Govermment of India should be urged to exercise further pressure onProvincial Governments, with a view to increasing the export office to Ceylon, on the lines indicated in the Viceroy&apos;s telegram.The Secretary of State for the Colonies reminded the WarCabinet that, unless some -special steps were taken, Ceylon&apos;s suppliesof cereals would be exhausted by the third week of October. If wecould be assured that sufficient supplies of rice would be madeavailable from India, as from a specified future date in the autumn,the immediate situation might be met by increasing shipments ofwheat from Australia.The Minister of War Transport pointed out that shippingcould not readily be provided, to carry wheat from Australia to ceylon; at most, it would not be possible to carry more than30,000 tons in September. On the other hand, there would be nodifficulty in providing additional shipping to bring rice from Indiato Ceylon.It was suggested that, if the crux of the difficulty lay msecuring additional supplies of rice in the immediate future, to tideover the present acute shortage,. the Government of India couldalmost certainly make special arrangements to this end, even thoughthe extra supply so sent might have to be offset against the amountsto be provided in later months..The War Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, theSecretary of State for India and Sir RamaswamiMudaliar to consider what further measures could betaken to meet the immediate needs of the situation byobtaining special emergency shipments of rice from india, and to arrange for the necessary communications&apos; to be sent to the Government of India.
(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for India andSir Eamaswami Mudaliar would represent to theViceroy the importance of urging Provincial Govern-ments to take steps to ensure that the regular monthlyshipments of rice to Ceylon were increased, as quickly as possible, to the level required to meet the Island5!current needs for cereals and to build up a reserve oftwo months&apos; supply.Great George Street, S.W. 1,September 14, 1942.   .
