Clark Kerr,putting forward the immense advantages whichwould result from a meeting between the PtE&amp;meMinister and M.

Stalin would be of the greatest value, and, in his view, would be of far more value than a visit by thePrime Minister to Egypt.   Against the advantages of sucha visit there must, however, be put the risks to thePrime Minister&apos;s health which such a journey would involve.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he believed it was his^lduty to go on this journey.   The risk to health shouldnot be over stressed, and he felt confident of his fitnessto undertake the journey.   His medical adviser, Sir CharlesWilson, would go with him, and he would take all dueprecautions.   He proposed to telegraph to M. Stalin tosay that he was coming out to Egypt and that he would liketo meet him at Astrakhan, or such other place as wouldsuit M. Stalin, in order to give him an account of ourP;: discussions with the United States authorities and of our plans for 1942.   He would take to meet M. Stalin theChief of the Imperial General Staff, who was flying out to egypt separately, and Sir Alexander Cadogan.

Stalin, felt that the risks to health should be duly considered before a final decision was reached^]They therefore asked that one or two of their number shouldhave an opportunity of discussing the matter with the PrimeMinister9s medical adviser and the Prime Minister, before a    jfinal decision was reached.Great George Street,           This was ahreed to.30 th July, 1942.--
