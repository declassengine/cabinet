The War Cabinet considered whether it would be desirablethat any further statement should be made on behalf of the Govern-ment at the present time in regard to the &quot; Second Front.&quot;The view taken was that, on balance, it was undesirable tomake any further statement on this matter at the present time.India* 5.   The War Cabinet considered a suggestion that the Govern-previous ment of India should make a public statement welcoming the reference:        attempt of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru to bring about a meeting of theW.M. (42) 105th leaders of the various elements of Indian opinion as a wiseConclusions,      alternative to the launching of Gandhi&apos;s threatened campaign of minute l.)        civil disobedience.   The statement might indicate that, if such arepresentative meeting were held, the Government of India wouldgive careful consideration to any suggestions submitted by it whichexpressed conclusions agreed upon by all the major sections ofIndian opinion.A statement on these lines might help to divorce moderateIndian opinion from Gandhi, and might correct the tendency for world opinion to concentrate attention on Gandhi and the activitiesof Congress.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the issue of sucha statement was likely to be interpreted in India as a sign of weakness on the part of the Government; and it was agreed thatit would be inexpedient to issue such a statement at this stage.The Secretary of State for India read to the War Cabinet theViceroy5 s reply to the telegram which had been sent to him inpursuance of the conclusions reached by the War Cabinet at their meeting the previous evening (W.M. (42) 105th Conclusions,Minute 1). In this telegram (No. 2314-S, dated the 7th August) the[24212J b 2
Viceroy said that, in the light of the recommendations made by theWar Cabinet, he had taken the view of his Executive Council onthe question whether Gandhi should be removed outside India. TheCouncil were strongly opposed to this course. Assuming that ghandi intended to fast, they thought it would be easier to dealwith him if he were detained in India than if he were abroad oron the high seas. The Viceroy thought it would be impossible to persuade the Council to agree to Gandhi&apos;s deportation; and, inview of his anxiety to carry them with him, he did not propose topress the matter further. He had not thought it wise to raise withthe Council at this stage the question of applying the &quot; cat-and-mouse &quot; procedure if Gandhi fasted while under detention inIndia. One member of the Council had, however, said already that,if Gandhi did fast, he should be left to face the consequences.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that, while theyregretted the Viceroy&apos;s decision, it would be inexpedient to attemptto overrule the judgment formed on this point by those on the spot.It was, however, essential to secure a firm assurance from theGovernment of India that they would not in any circumstancesapply the &apos;&apos; cat-and-mouse&apos;&apos; procedure, and that they were determined, if Gandhi fasted while under detention in India, tocontinue his detention whatever the consequences.The question was also raised whether the Viceroy was notattaching too great importance to carrying his Executive council with him in all decisions which would have to be taken in thiscrisis. The vital need was for the Government of India to showfirmness and determination in dealing with this situation, and theViceroy must, above all, be in a position to take prompt and decisiveaction. This must come first, and it must not be prejudiced by thedesire to obtain the full support of the Executive Council. In thelast resort, the responsibility lay with the Viceroy, and not withthe Council. The views of the War Cabinet on this point shouldbe made clear to the Viceroy, and he should at the same time be assured that, in taking a strong and vigorous line, he could count on the full support of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The War Cabinet also had before them a telegram from theViceroy (No. 2308-S, dated the 7th August) regarding a suggestionthat the position of the Executive Council would be strengthenedif Sir Reginald Maxwell and Sir Jeremy Raisman were replaced by Indians.The view of the War Cabinet was that there could be noquestion of considering such changes in the composition of theCouncil at this time.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) The Government of India should not be asked at this stage to make any public statement welcoming the attempt ofSir Tej Bahadur Sapru to bring about a meeting of theleaders of the various elements of Indian opinion.(2) The Secretary of State for India should reply to theViceroy&apos;s telegram No. 2314-S in the following sense : (a) The War Cabinet were strongly impressed by theneed for prompt and decisive action. In their view, it was of the very greatest importance thatthe Government of India should show firmnessand determination in dealing with this crisis.(6) The War Cabinet had thought that the position ofthe Government of India would have been easierif Gandhi had been removed outside India.Having regard, however, to the terms of theViceroy&apos;s telegram, they did not desire to press that view. The Government of India should,-   however, take a firm decision at the outset that,
203W.M. 107 (42).if Gandhi fasted while under detention, the&quot;cat-and-mouse&quot; procedure would not in any* circumstances be applied, and that Gandhi must continue in detention whatever the consequences.(c) In all these matters the Viceroy should, if possible,carry his Executive Council with him; but his desire to do so should not be allowed to prejudice the vital objectives set out in (a) and (6) above.(d) The Viceroy could rely on the fullest and strongestsupport of His Majesty&apos;s Government in carrying through .the course of action which the WarCabinet had approved.(3) The Secretary of State for India should also inform- theViceroy, in a separate telegram, that, if Gandhi fastedwhile under detention in India, it would, in the view ofthe War Cabinet, be most inexpedient that announce-ments should be made from day to day regarding hiscondition.(4) In reply to the suggestions that Indians should beappointed to the Executive Council in place ofSir Reginald Maxwell and Sir Jeremy Raisman, theViceroy should make it clear that there could be noquestion of considering such changes in the composition of the Council at this time.Parliament. 6.   The Deputy Prime  Minister  said  that he had beenVisits of M.Ps. approached by a Member of Parliament who claimed that certain to Theatres members of the Air Council had told him that, if he could secure theof War. Prime Ministers consent, they would welcome his making a tourof inspection of the RAP. in the Middle East.   After a short discussion The War Cabinet-Agreed that it Would be impossible to grant such facilities at the request of individual Members of Parliament, andthat permission should be withheld in this particular case.Note. The War Cabinet were later informed by the Secretaryof State for Air that no invitation had been given to thisMember of Parliament by any member of the Air Councilto visit the Middle East.Great George Street, S.W.1,August 7, 1942.
