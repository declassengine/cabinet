131W.M. 90 (42).Post-WarRelief.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 83rdConclusions,Minute 8.)1. The War Cabinet again considered the matter in thelight of a Memorandum by the Prime Minister (W.P. (42) 282).At their meeting oh the 29th June the War Cabinet, had agreed that Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, who was engaged in discussions on post-war relief in Washington, should be authorisedto say that &quot;as part of the common plan, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will be prepared to continue in this country, afterthe end of hostilities, a system of rationing of food and clothing,and other suitable measures of control over essential commodities,so long as the available supplies are not sufficient to meet the urgent needs of Allied countries which have regained their freedom.&quot; In his Memorandum the Prime Minister suggestedthat there was no need to commit ourselves at this stage to anUndertaking which might involve reducing our standard of lifeto the average level of those European countries which had been unable to defend their soil and independence. The British peoplemight well be ready to make such a sacrifice on the morrow of victory out of pity for a starving Europe, and as a voluntary act of generosity; but the Government ought not to commit them toit in advance, without consulting Parliament or the public.After a full discussion, the War Cabinet reached the followingconclusion : The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary and the President of the Board ofTrade, should draft a telegram to Sir Frederick Leith-Rosson this matter. This telegram should instruct him that heshould :-(a) Enter into no final commitment on this point on behalf ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government.(b) Ensure that there would be no public statement that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were willing to continuerationing for this purpose after the war.(c) Make it clear that, since His Majesty&apos;s Government couldnot entertain the proposal for continued rationingexcept as part of a common plan for the international organisation of post-war relief, it followed that no final decision could be reached on this point until theyhad had an opportunity of examining the plan as awhole.France. 2.

(42) 279),about the proposed publicationof a volume of memoirs.The War Cabinet :-Expressed agreement with the conclusion reached by theLord Privy Seal, that permission should be withheld for thepublication of those passages in this book for which theconsent of the Government was required. The Secretary was accordingly instructed to inform the author that consentcould not be given for publication of the book in its present form.Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 9, 1942.- In f^Vour of publication it was urged, that the pamphletrevealed little or nothing which was not already available to theenemy, but told a story of British courage and determination,which would be of great value, . /&apos;., The arguments against were, that publication of this pamphletwould be of value to the enemy by providing: him with an authori?tative account of the effects of each of their main attacks: thatwe could not afford to give this information to the enemy, who might well start air attacks again; and that we should be blamedif, shortly after the publication of this pamphlet, attacks wererenewed. *The view generally expressed by the War Cabinet was, thatthe account given was in parts somewhat too detailed (more par-ticularly as regards the effect of attacks on particular centres),and that some sections would have to be re-written in more general terms. The view was also expressed that it would be a serious matter to authorise publication of a pamphlet which gave informa-tion which, in the considered view of the Air Staff, would be of value to the enemy.The War Cabinet:-Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of home security and the Secretary of State for Air to give furtherconsideration to this pamphlet, with a view to revisions, onthe lines indicated above, being made which were acceptable to both Ministries. Should a settlement not be. reached between the Ministers concerned, the matter should again bebrought before the War Cabinet.
