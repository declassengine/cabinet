India. The War Cabinet resumed discussion of this matter and hadWar Financial before them a Memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerSettlement of (W.P. (42) 325) and one by the Secretary of State for India1940. (W.P. (42) 328), together with a copy of a telegram (No. 2255/S,Indian dated the 31st July) from the Viceroy to the Secretary of State forSterling India.Balances. The War Cabinet were reminded that the assumption under-previous lying the financial settlement reached in April 1940 had been thatReference:        the war was not India&apos;s affair, except in so far as the local defenceW.M. (42) 105th of India was concerned.   This had no doubt been a tenable pointConclusions,      of view in 1939 and 1940, when the war was regarded as primarilyMinute 2.)        a European affair; but the whole position had been altered by theentry of Japan into the war.   India was now fighting for her ownexistence.   It followed that the settlement of April 1940 was nolonger appropriate to present circumstances, even after taking intoaccount the fact that India was now incurring far more expendi-ture in her own local defence than had been contemplated when theagreement was concluded.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to the factthat, when the settlement of April 1940 had been under discussion,his predecessor in office had written to the then Secretary of Statefor India (on the 7th February, 1940) asking him to put it to theGovernment of India that there should be some reconsideration ata later date, in the light of the knowledge of what extra actualexpenditure there had been, as to whether, from the financial andpolitical points of view, Indian revenues could not make a furthercontribution for this purpose, and suggesting that the situationwould be met if the question were again examined in a year&apos;s time.The then Secretary of State for India (Lord Zetland) had replied(on the 14th February, 1940) that he saw no reason to object to thepossibility of India&apos;s making some payment towards the generalexpense of the war being considered from time to time as cir-cumstances permitted, although it must not be assumed thatconsideration would be favourable.Reference was also made to the fact that India&apos;s war effortincluded the provision of men and material, not only for thedefence of India, but for the war generally. In this connection,however, it would be right to bear in mind that the normal balanceof exchange of goods and services between countries had beendistorted by the war. Since all our energies were now directed tothe war effort, we could not now pay for all the exports from India,including exports of war material, by goods or services exportedfrom this country. This was the primary reason why India wasnow accumulating sterling balances so fast that they might reach M. 400 or  M. 450 at the end of this financial year. Therewas a strong case for our establishing a position now, whichwould enable the matter to be readjusted at a later date, so as totake into account the expenditure which we had incurred on Indian.defence, in the light of a wider conception of India&apos;s partnershipin the general war effort.It was also relevant to bear in mind that any commitmentleaving this country liable to repay large sums to India after thewar would necessarily have a serious effect on the arrangementsmade for settlement of indebtedness between this country and othersof the United Nations. Indeed, application of the financialsettlement of April 1940, without any qualification, would be incon-sistent with the basis of settlement which we wished to see appliedbetween the United Nations generally, and would be likely to leadto a repetition of the position in regard to international indebted-ness which had arisen after the last war.At the same time, it was recognised that there would be seriousdisadvantages in asking for the settlement of April 1940 to berevised at this juncture.-  - The War Cabinet therefore reached the conclusion that, whilethe financial settlement of April 1940 should stand, the Governmentof India should be informed of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-

Thisdraft would be circulated to the War Cabinet beforev       despatch.
