, 1. At their meeting on the 1st August, 1942, the War Cabinethad remitted, for consideration by a Committee of Ministers,certain proposals by the First Lord of the Admiralty for modifica-tions in the programme approved by the War Cabinet in April 1942(W.M. (42) 53rd Conclusions, Minute 4).NavalConstructionProgramme.(PreviousWM^lOlst The War Cabinet now had before them the followingConclusions,     Memoranda : Minute 4.)Y &quot;(A) Memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (W.P. (42) 411).Formal confirmation from the War Cabinet was sought for thefollowing proposals which had been approved by the Committee ofMinisters: (a) to add to the 1942 programme nine intermediate carriers,it being understood that this addition to the programmewould not be made at the expense of the provision ofaircraft for the Royal Air Force;(b) to add to the 1942 programme seven single-screw corvettesand to cancel four twin-screw corvettes.(B) Memorandum by the Minister of Production (W.P. (42) 412).The Committee of Ministers had invited the Minister ofProduction, in consultation with the First Lord of the Admiralty,to consider the possibility of continuing the cruiser programme (or,alternatively, increasing still further the carrier programme) con-currently with the additions to the 1942 programme under (A).As a result (i) approval was sought for the addition to the programme ofthree additional intermediate carriers (the limit of theslips available) and the reinstatement of one cruiser;(ii) it was recommended that the Admiralty should be invitedto press on with their action for securing the mostefficient use of labour, and that the Minister of Labourshould be invited to give urgent attention to the conse-quential labour demands.The following were the main points made in discussion : -(1) General agreement was expressed with the view that theprimary need was to take all practicable steps to buildas many destroyers and corvettes as possible. Anassurance was given that it was the Admiralty&apos;s policyto employ all slips suitable for building these classes ofships to the utmost.(2) Reference was made to the Admiralty proposal to build16 Special Fleet Destroyers, having a greater power ofA.A. fire than the existing type.The Prime Minister said that, since the Admiraltyhad agreed to substantial measures of cancellation andpostponement in regard to the Cruiser programme, hewould withdraw the objections which he had raised, onthe ground of the longer time which they took tocomplete, to the construction of these 16 Special FleetDestroyers.&apos;(3) Reference was made to the &quot; Hunt &quot; Class Destroyers. Itwas explained that, owing to their short endurance,these vessels were only suitable for work in coastaiwaters or, e.g., in the Mediterranean.(4) The War Cabinet was informed that, owing to otherpressing needs, the date of completion of the Vanguardhad been slipping back.The Prime Minister thought that special effortsshould be made to complete this vesesl, which was a mostimportant man-of-war, as quickly as possible, and askedthat the matter should be looked into.
; 39 W.M. 128 (2).(5) The main point on which discussion turned was the -impingement on the construction of fast cargo liners ofthe proposal to lay down 3 further intermediate carriers.The War Cabinet was informed that it was believedthat the loss of new merchant construction involved couldbe made good, but only by the substitution for the fastcargo liners of slower vessels. The limiting factor wasthe number of slips suitable for the construction of large- vessels of the fast cargo liner type, these being slipswhich were also required for the construction ofintermediate carriers.(6) The Minister of War Transport explained that the loss ofthese vessels would be severely felt. Not only would hebe deprived of valuable insulated tonnage, but it was toour limited resources in fast merchant ships that we hadto look for the, type of merchant shipping suitable foroperational purposes.(7) The Minister of War Transport added that he was hopingto get 11 vessels from the United States of 15 knotsspeed; but the United States were finding difficulties inproviding us with fast cargo liners with insulated cargospace.(8) The following particulars were given of the constructionof carriers : A rmoured Carriers 2 due for completion in 1944.3 in 1946.Intermediate Carriers 4 due for completion during 1944.9 due for completion in 1945.3 proposed in the Paper now under discussion.Auxiliary Carriers 8 due for delivery in 1942.4 due for certain from the United States in 1942.12 expected from the United States in 1943 as ourshare of the pool.3 due for completion in the United Kingdom in 1943and 1 in 1944.The War Cabinet (i) Gave formal approval to the proposals in W.P. (42) 411,summarised at &quot; X &quot; above,(ii) Decided that the proposals in, the Memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (42) 412), summarised at&quot; Y * above should be postponed for further considera-tion, in view of the conflict between IntermediateCarriers and fast cargo liners. The Minister ofProduction was asked to examine this issue in cohsul-tation with the First Lord of the Admiralty and theMinister of War Transport.Naval 2.   The War Cabinet, at their Meeting on the 1st August, hadConstruction remitted to a Committee of Ministers certain questions affectingProgramme. the construction of aircraft.   This Committee, at their MeetingFighter on the 6th August, had invited the Minister of Production, inAircraft for consultation with the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretarythe Fleet of State for Air, and the Minister of Aircraft Production, toAir Arm. examine a Memorandum on Fighter Requirements of the Fleet Air(Previous Arm (D.C. (S) (42) 73), with a view to reducing the Fleet Air ArmReference: Reserves to an agreed minimum.W.M. (42) 101stConclusions, ,Minute 4.)... &apos;
Radio Board.(PreviousReference:W.M. (41) 1stConclusions,Minute 13.)3. The War Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (42) 415 (Revise)), giving theComposition and the Terms of Reference of the Radio Board whichwas to be responsible for securing a single coherent policy on thedevelopment and production of radio equipment, on scientificresearch for that purpose and on such questions of inter-serviceradio policy as might be determined by the Chiefs of StaffCommittee.Great George Street, S.W. 1,September 22, 1942.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (42) 413) submitting the followingproposals by agreement with the Ministers concerned: (a) That the Air Ministry should reduce their demand forSpitfires until the end of 1943 by 120 (in addition toproviding for the Fleet Air Arm.80 obsolescent Spitfiresand Hurricanes for training as already agreed).(6) That the Admiralty should reduce (i) Reserves of Supernumerary Squadrons to 50 percent, (from 100 per cent.),(ii) Training reserves to 80 per cent, (from 90 per cent.),(iii) Allowance    for    wastage    of    SupernumerarySquadrons to 4 per cent, a month (instead of8 per cent.).The Minister of Production said that the proposals in hisPaper represented an agreed solution, although the First Lord ofthe Admiralty had found it necessary to stipulate that acceptanceof the reductions involved should be regarded as a temporaryexpedient, to be made good as soon as possible.The Minister of Production added, however, that he had thatmorning been informed by the First Lord of the Admiralty thatSeafires could only be used by very experienced pilots on AuxiliaryCarriers. As a result, the Admiralty required 120 II C&apos;s insubstitution for the same number of Seafires. These could only beprovided at the expense of the Russian allotment.The Prime Minister said that this fact would have to be furtherinvestigated, and that, if need be, the Admiralty would have to beprepared to face a further reduction in the scale of reserves.Subject to examination of this further point, the WarCabinet Gave approval to the proposals set out in the Memorandumby the Minister of Production (W.P. (42) 413).
