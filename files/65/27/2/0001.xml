Two enemy merchant vessels had been hit andthree probably hit.Total enemy losses for the week amounted to 11 machines forcertain, 1 probable and 15 damaged. We had lost 5 fighters,29 bombers and 1 Coastal Command aircraft.There were signs, that the enemy, who had received reinforce-ments from the South Russian front, intended to make heavier air attacks on Malta. During the previous week enemy losses amountedto 23 machines for certain, 5 probable and 25 damaged. We had lost 13 machines (5 on the ground) with 15 damaged.Air operations had been on an intense scale and there were indications that the enemy air force was suffering from administra-tive difficulties. The enemy losses had amounted to 41 destroyed,13 probable, 45 damaged as against 40 destroyed and 8 damaged ofour own. Most of our losses had occurred when attacking groundtroops.  These figures were probably incomplete.The Allied shipping losses in the previous seven days amountedto 141,000 tons. 8Details were given of the attacks on the latest convoy to north russia. Reports showed that up to date we had lost 11 ships outof 34. Five ships of the returning convoy had been mined offIceland.The Prime Minister said that early consideration must be givento the arrangements for escorting future convoys to North Russia.Details were given of the recent fighting about El Alamein,where the enemy offensive had been successfully held.In the north there had been no activity on the Finnish Frontexcept for the bombing of Murmansk, where great damage had beendone.In the Moscow Sector German attacks had been of only localsignificance. Further south a major German offensive had developed in the Kursk and Kharkov Sectors, where the enemy hadin some places penetrated to a depth of 50 miles.

(42) 79thConclusions,Minute, 1.)2. The Secretary of State for War undertook to arrange forinformation to be collected by the Army authorities in the middle east as to the circumstances which had led to the surrender of tobruk.The Prime Minister said that he would consult with theSecretary of State for War with a view to submitting to the WarCabinet proposals defining the conditions which must be satisfiedbefore any General Officer in the field was justified in surrendering,and emphasising the obligation on all units to continue fighting solong as possible.[24075]
Czechoslovakia.relations withCzechoslovakGovernment.(PreviousEeferenoe:W.M. (41) 71stConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum on thissubject by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 280).&quot;Our recognition of the Czechoslovak Government in July 1941had been subject to reservations regarding future frontiers, thejuridical continuity of the Czechoslovak Government, and theauthority of that Government over Sudeten Germans now inBritish territory. Dr. Benes was anxious for a further declaration,designed to make it clear that these reservations implied no difference in status between the Czechoslovaks and our other Allies.To meet his views, it was proposed that a further communication should be made to the Czechoslovak Government, in the terms setout in the Annex to the Memorandum, declaring that, as regardsfrontiers, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be influenced bythe terms of the Munich Agreement; and that, when arrangements had been made for adequate Sudeten German representation on the czechoslovak State Council, we would also withdraw the reserva-tion regarding the relations between the Czechoslovak Governmentand Sudeten Germans now in British territory. The second partof this communication would not be published until arrangements had been made for the addition of Sudeten German representatives to the State Council.The Foreign Secretary also proposed that, in discussions withdraw. Benes and 8 the Sudeten German representatives, he should indicate that His Majesty&apos;s Government approved in principle thetransfer to Germany after the war, in appropriate cases, of Germanminorities in Central and South-Eastern Europe.On this point it was suggested that special care should be takento make it clear that the principle approved related only to thetransfer of populations and did, riot commit His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment as regards the transfer of territory.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposals put forward in w.P. (42) 280.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to proceed forthwith todiscuss the position with Dr. Benes on these lines.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs tocommunicate the text of the proposed declaration to dominion Governments, on the understanding that thedeclaration would not be published until their replieshad been received. -War Criminals.ProposedUnited nations commission onAtrocities.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 3rdConclusions,Minute 5.).4.   The War Cabinet had before them *(a) A Note by the Prime Minister (W.P. (42) 277) regarding ascheme, agreed in principle .with President Roosevelt,for the establishment of a United Nations Commissionon Atrocities.(b) A Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(W.P. (42) 264) covering a Memorandum by the LawOfficers of the Crown setting out the issues involved in.  the trial and punishment of war criminals.        :In discussion, it was explained that the proposed Commissionon Atrocities would be purely a fact-finding body. Its functions would be somewhat similar to those of the Committee appointed inSeptember 1914 to investigate reports of German atrocities in belgium; but its composition would be international and it would report to the United Nations. *Separate arrangements would have to be made for the trial andpunishment of particular war criminals.
121 W.M\ 86 (42).The War Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposal for the appointment ofa United Nations Commission oh Atrocities, on the lines indicated in W.P. (42) 277.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to appoint a small Committeeof Ministers (including the Lord Chancellor, the lord privy Seal, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,the Minister of Information and the Attorney-General)to work out the details of a scheme, covering both thefact-finding Commission and the trial and punishmentof particular war criminals, on the general lines indicated in W.P. (42) 264.India. 5.   The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by the(Previous Secretary of State for India (W.P. (42) 255 and W.P. (42) 271)Eefereneei setting out the policy likely to be adopted by Gandhi and theW.M. (42) 74th Congress Party, and the counter-action which might be necessary.Conclusions, The War Cabinet-Minute 3.)Decided to take note of these Memoranda, without at thisstage endorsing all the Viceroy&apos;s suggestions.Parliament. 6.   The War Cabinet were informed that a request had beenDebate on the made for a Debate in the following week on a group of Votes,shipping including that for the Ministry of War Transport, the object beingsituation. to secure a debate on the Shipping Situation.  A strong desire had(Previous been expressed that the Debate should not be held in secret.reference: The War Cabinet were reminded that a Debate on the ShippingW.M. (42) 81st Situation had been held in Secret Session not very long ago, in which conclusions, the Government spokesman had replied very effectively to the critics.Minute 1.) The desire for a further Debate arose largely out of the particulars of American shipping losses published in the United States. Asa result, statements had been appearing in the Press suggesting that very large numbers of ships had been lost, and some alarmingrumours were in circulation.It was explained that the United States practice was to publish the names of ships lost when survivors were landed in Americanterritory. No tonnage figures were mentioned. The publishedparticulars of losses were thus incomplete and misleading. ThePrime Minister, on his recent visit to the United States, had suggested to the United States authorities that they should considerstopping the publication of these particulars.The point for decision by the War Cabinet was whether the debate should take place in Secret Session. After discussion, theWar Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) The Lord Privy Seal, as Leader of the House, should explain that it was not possible for the Government todeal with the question of shipping losses in PublicSession. If, therefore, the Debate took the form of a discussion of shipping losses, it would have to take placein Secret Session. If, however, it was desired to confine the discussion to other aspects of the shipping situationin which the House had recently shown an interest, the debate would be held in Public Session.(2) If the Debate took place in Secret Session, the actual figuresof shipping losses would not be disclosed, but the main factors of the situation could be explained in general-terms.
7. The War Cabinet were informed that representatives ofthe Ministry of Aircraft Production had given evidence before theon Fighting Services Sub-Committee on the 30th June. Questions putmade it clear that the Committee wished to be given the detailedproduction programme of gliders, &amp;c, and the dates by which thedifferent stages of production were due for completion. This infor-mation had been refused, on the ground that it had an importantoperational significance and that the Government were not preparedto disclose it.73rd       Although this position had been.reaffirmed by the Minister of,      Aircraft Production in a letter dated the 3rd July, the Chairmanof the Sub-Committee had nevertheless pressed that he should appear before them to give evidence on Tuesday, the 7th July.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the particulars asked for should not be disclosed.(2) Took the view that the Minister should appear before theCommittee and should explain that the evidence askedfor clearly concerned issues of an operational or policycharacter, which, in the Government &apos;s view, fell outsidethe terms of reference given to the Committee by the.House.Reference was also made to a letter sent to the War Office, onbehalf of the Sub-Committee of Production and Supply (A), asking for evidence on &quot; the present tank situation, whether production isconsidered satisfactory, and whether the tanks and their armamentsnow in extensive production are designed to meet all likely require-ments in the field.&quot;The War Cabinet (3) Agreed that most, at any rate, of the particulars coveredby these enquiries were outside the Committee&apos;s termsof reference. The Secretary of State for War was authorised to deal with the matter on this basis, keeping in close consultation with the Minister of aircraft production, as regards the exact terms of reply sent.Reference was also made to certain other requests from members of Parliament and Parliamentary Committees for infor-mation about the development of munitions of war. In dealingwith these requests. Ministers would be guided by the general rule that, while it was within their discretion to disclose information inappropriate cases to Parliamentary Committees or Members ofParliament, there was no obligation to disclose information if itwould be contrary to the public interest to do so.Great George Street, S.W. 1,&apos;   July 6, 1942.
