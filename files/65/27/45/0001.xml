India. 1.   The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theRequest by Secretary of State for India (W.P. (42) 391), the Lord Privy SealChamber of (W-P. (42) 420) and the Minister of Economic Warfare (W.P.Princes for       (42)428).Statement of The Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India con-Policy by His tained a letter from the Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes toMajesty&apos;s the Viceroy&apos;s Political Adviser, complaining that the interests ofGovernment.,    the Indian Princes had been neglected in the Draft Declaration by .His Majesty&apos;s Government and in the discussion which took placethereon. The Princes were disquieted by the apparent intentionto impose on them a revision of their treaties and the introductionof democratic institutions, and they considered that non-adheringStates Jike non-adhering provinces should have the right to forma separate Union of their own.The Secretary of State for India, after consulting the Viceroy,suggested the terms of the reply to be made, which should beregarded as confidential.The Lord Privy Seal, in his Memorandum, urged that it wasundesirable to modify the stated policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment as regards the development of representative institutions inthe States, and that we should do everything in our power toencourage the rulers of the States to introduce democracy. Further,the complications inherent in the idea of a separate States Unionshould not be introduced for the sake of providing the Princes witha bargaining counter. In his view, it was undesirable to make afurther statement of policy to the Princes at the moment.The Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfareemphasised the importance of our reputation as a loyal observer oftreaties; and urged that it should be made public that Britainintended to honour all her obligations to the Indian States, and thatpressure would not be brought to bear on them to expedite theirconstitutional development. -; &apos; .After discussion, the War Cabinet reached the followingConclusions : (1) The objections to making public a reply to the letter fromthe Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes would notapply to a short, simple statement. Since the terms ofany reply made were likely to become known, it wouldbe better that the reply should be given publicly.(2) The reply should be confined to two specific points : (a) It should be made clear that we adhered to ourexisting treaty obligations. The Lord PrivySeal&apos;s statement in the House of Commons (as toencouraging and expediting the development ofsuitable representative institutions in all IndianStates) should not be taken as in any way incon-sistent with those obligations; but we saw noreason to redefine those obligations or to add tothem at the present time.(b) The fact that no explicit provision had been madein the draft Declaration for Indian States, notadhering to the Indian Union, to form a separateUnion of their own should not be taken as consti-tuting adverse discrimination, by implying thatsuch States had no right to form a Union. Thereason why the matter had not been referred toin the draft Declaration was that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had direct responsibility for theGovernments of the Provinces of British India,as contrasted with the independent status of theIndian States. No reason, however, was seen toenter at this juncture into a discussion of thei detailed issues involved in such a development.* Appendix to W.P. (42) 283.
W.M. 129 (42).

The Secretary of State for India was invited to draft a short statement on the above lines, which should be submitted to the Prime Minister, who would settle whether it should be circulated to the War Cabinet.

India War Financial Settlement of 1940 and Indian Sterling Balances. 

(Previous Reference W.M. (42) 125th Conclusions.)

2. At their meeting, bn the 16th September, 1942, the War Cabinet had invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for India, to draft, and circulate to the War Cabinet before despatch, a telegram to the Viceroy in the sense that while the Financial Settlement of 1940&apos; still stood, His Majesty&apos;s Government felt bound to inform the Government of India of their views concerning the need for financial readjustment on a wider basis, and that, while, His Majesty&apos;s Government were not disposed to press the matter at the present time, the issue would have to be raised at a convenient  opportunity.

The War Cabinet now had before them :-

Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer covering draft telegram to the Viceroy (W.P. (42) 421).

Note by the Prime Minister covering revised draft telegram to the Viceroy (W.P. (42) 422).

In the course of discussion, copies of Private and Personal telegrams exchanged between the Secretary of State and the Viceroy (Nos. 1129, 1139 and 1143 from the Secretary of State, and No. 228-S. from the Viceroy) were handled to the War Cabinet.

The War Cabinet agreed that the following action should be taken:-

(1) The Prime Minister would send a Private and Personal telegram to the Viceroy, on the lines discussed during the Meeting, explaining the course of the discussions on this matter in the War Cabinet.

(2) The draft telegram from the Secretary of State to the Viceroy, as set out in W.P. (42) 422, should be despatched, subject to the alterations shown below.

(3) This telegram should be sent under a covering telegram to the Viceroy, which should bring out the following points:-

(a) The views set out in the telegram referred to in in Conclusion (2) did not arise out of the supervisory functions exercised by the Government of the United Kingdom over the Government of India, but represented a statement by the United Kingdom Government of their own position.

(b) While His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom felt it necessary that a statement of their own views should be put forward, they were not seeking to impose these views on the Government of India.

(c) The War Cabinet would be glad of the views of the Viceroy as to the best way of handling this matter in relation to his Council, before any communication was made to them.

(4) The telegram in (3) would be drafted by the Lord President of the Council and the Secretary of State for India, and shown to the Prime Minister before despatch

NOTE.- The following are teh amendments approved in the text of the draft telegram to the Viceroy as set out in W.P. (42) 422:-

Paragraph 1. - This should read as follows :-

" The War Cabinet have given further consideration to the quesiton of the War Financial Settlement of 1940 and think it right to set out the point of view which they hold on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government."

[24397]
Paragraph 2.-No alteration.Paragraph 3. For the last two sentences, substitute thefollowing:  ...&apos;&apos; The whole principle on which the war has been financedamongst the countries who are fighting the common enemy isthat in,the result no one of them should build up a greatindebtedness against any other.&quot;Paragraph 4. Delete the words  *It will be recalled that.&apos; . .&quot;.Paragraph 5. This should read as follows : &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government do not suggest that a newSettlement should be negotiated at the present juncture withthe Government of India. A further, review and eventualadjustment of financial relations between the United Kingdomand India will assuredly be required in the light and in theframework both of the general financial settlement between theAllied Nations and of the vital importance for all concerned ofthe speedy restoration of the maximum volume of world trade.&quot;3. The Prime Minister said that on reflection he felt that therewere certain risks in a debate on India in the near future. Therewere certain big issues which, if they were raised, would have tobe answered, but which could hardly be answered without stirringup controversy. This would be undesirable at the present time.He thought that the leaders of the political parties should takesuitable opportunities of representing this point of view to theirfollowers.The Secretary of State for India said that before the end ofOctober it would be necessary to pass legislation prolonging theSection 93 Governments in certain provinces.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the passage ofthis legislation should provide the opportunity for such discussionas might be necessary in regard to India; and that efforts shouldbe made to avoid a controversial debate on the whole&quot; Indian positionat the present juncture.Parliament.Debate onIndia.(PreviousReference:W.M.
