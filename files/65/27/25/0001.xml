Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 103rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Malta.Egypt.naval operations.MilitaryOperations.Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thelast six days.The main operations of Bomber Command had been night attacks on Duisburg and Osnabruck.The&apos;enemy had carried out a number of nuisance raids on thiscountry. He had sent 37 aircraft over by day and 111 by night.He had lost 10 per cent, of the aircraft which had attacked thiscountry by night.During the previous six days the total enemy losses had been14 destroyed, 2 probable and 4 damaged. We had lost 5 fighters,20 bombers and 4 Coastal Command aircraft. :In reply to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff said that itwas not intended this year to carry out attacks against Germanforests and crops. Such attacks represented a big diversion fromthe weight of our attack against German industry, without anycommensurable results.The scale of enemy action against Malta had been reduced bysome 25 per cent. The enemy had lost 6 aircraft for certain,2 probable and 1 damaged.  We had had 3 aircraft damaged.There had been little activity by enemy air forces. R.A.F.activity had been maintained, particularly against the port of tobruk and the enemy&apos;s merchant vessels. Enemy losses had been8 aircraft destroyed, 3 probable and 7 damaged. We had lost28 aircraft destroyed and 11 damaged.Shipping losses during the past week amounted to 136,000 tons(including certainlosses not previously reported), nearly all from u-boat attacksslow convoy now crossing the Atlanticpart in these attacks had been sunk.The enemy had lost 5 U-boats for certain and 1 probable in thepast eleven days.Russian resistance continued in the northern part of the Donbend. Elsewhere in the Don bend the situation appeared to havedeteriorated. A new and serious threat was developing againstStalingrad by enemy forces which had crossed the Don lower downand then turned north-east.On the lower Don and Caucasus front the German advance hadbeen rapid. The enemy had reached Maikop and Krasnodar.Russian resistance appeared to have been slight. Novorossisk must now be considered to be in jeopardy.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Particulars were given of the attacks against a two of the U-boats takingEire.Supply ofMilitaryEquipment.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 96thConclusions,Minute 6.)[24218-3]2. The War Cabinet had before them a Report (W.P. (42) 342)by the Chiefs of Staff, who had been invited to consider whether,political considerations apart, it would be in our interests, on military grounds, to supply Eire with the limited quantity of armsand munitions for which she had asked. The Chiefs of Staffrecommended that, from the military point of view, no more armsand equipment should be given to Eire except the mines for which she asked, and a strictly limited amount of equipment which couldbe spared without detriment to our own requirements, but that theAir Ministry should be allowed to provide sufficient equipment to eire, at its own discretion, in exchange for certain useful con-cessions obtainable through the Eire Army Air Corps.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, in view of ourprior commitments, it might be some time before we were in aposition to supply Eire with the 55 mines, together with theirancillary equipment, which were included in the list of Eiredemands (Annex II to W.P. (42) 342). - In our answer to the eire government it Would be Safer to mark these items &quot;as soon as available.&quot;b 2
Subject to the incorporation of the suggestion made bythe First Lord of the Admiralty, the War cabinet approved the report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (42) 342).AuxiliaryTerritorialService.CompulsoryPosting toSearchlightDuties.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 110thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (42) 348).At the time of the passing of the National Service No. 2 Act,making women liable for compulsory service in the auxiliary services, it had been made clear in Parliament that only selectedvolunteers would be entered for combatant duties (i.e., duties which involved participation in the use of lethal weapons). The Secretaryof State for War now recommended that, in view of the inadequatenumber of volunteers forthcoming, and in order to release every possible man for the Field Force, approval should be given, subjectto appropriate safeguards, to the compulsory posting of suitablemembers of the A.T.S. to searchlight duties.The memorandum set out the statements made by Ministers inParliament which were relevant to this issue.The Secretary of State for War said that enemy aircraft nowsometimes adopted the technique of diving down searchlight beamsand machine-gunning the crews. Means would have to be found of meeting those tactics, but he did not think that this affected themain point at issue.The Secretary of State also explained that, if the power to direct A.T.S. to searchlight duties was now taken, any women sodirected would first undergo training, and none of them would take up duties with the searchlights before Parliament reassembled onthe 8th September.The War Cabinet Agreed that suitable members of the A.T.S. should nowbe compulsorily posted to searchlight duties, as proposedin the Memorandum, it being understood (a) That the Secretary of State for War would make astatement as soon as Parliament reassembled, to theeffect that women were now being directed tosearchlight duties; and(6) That any women compulsorily directed in the mean-time would not be actually posted to searchlightsites before the above statement was made.West Africa. 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the liquor Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (42) 333).Supplies ^he Memorandum explained that the St. Germain liquor traffic Convention of 1919 to which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwas a party forbade the manufacture of distilled liquors in an area which included West Africa. Controlled imports were permitted under the Convention, but the cutting off of Continentalsupplies had caused an acute shortage of the cheaper brands, andhad given rise to a serious increase in illicit distillation in the gold coast. The West African Governors Conference had suggested the local distillation of spirits, under strict Government control.The Secretary of State for the Colonies sought the approval of theWar Cabinet for this course, which was in keeping with theintention of the Convention, namely, to ensure that the spiritsavailable were of good quality, and not to prevent altogether theconsumption of spirits by the African population.
The Dominions.ProposedImperialConference.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 84thConclusions,Minute 2.)United states forces.Arrangementsfor hospitality.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 93rdConclusions,Minute 2.)India.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 1.07thConclusions,Minute 5.)The War Cabinet approved in principle the proposal for local distillation of spirits in West Africa, provided thatthis was carried out by some Government agency.Before effect was given to this proposal, the foreign secretary should inform the United States Government ofthe action proposed, and should ascertain from the free french, Belgian and Portuguese authorities, who were alsosignatories to the Convention, how they had dealt with theproblem in their African territories, and the views they held.5. The War Cabinet were informed that Field-Marshal Smutswas proposing to visit this country early in September. The PrimeMinister had suggested that this might afford an opportunity tohold an Imperial War Conference, to be attended by as many of theDominion Prime Ministers as might be able to come to this country at that time.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to enquire of all the Dominion Prime Ministers whether theywould be able to attend such a Conference in the early partof September next.6. Reference was made to the arrangements for providinghospitality for members of the United States Forces in this country.The Minister of Information said that he had undertaken theresponsibility for co-ordinating these arrangements so far as british agencies were concerned.* All the voluntary Britishagencies had now been brought together under a single co-co-ordinating committee, and it was hoped that before long a workmanlikeorganisation would be established. Close contact was already being maintained with General Eisenhower on all these questions, andarrangements would be made for effective liaison with the WarOffice and Air Ministry. The Minister was asked to arrange forhis Committee to keep in touch with Sir Findlater Stewart, whowas concerned with similar problems as Chairman of the BoleroCommittee.The presence of coloured troops among the United states forces had given rise to some difficulties, but General Eisenhowerwas now proposing to segregate these troops in a limited number of areas, where special arrangements would be made for them.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Information to continue to beresponsible for the co-ordination of these arrangements,keeping in close touch with the Foreign Office on thepolitical aspects of the question and consulting as necessary with Sir Findlater Stewart and the service departments, and asked him to report to the lord president of the Council any disputes or difficulties whichcould not be overcome by his Committee.7. The War Cabinet Were given the latest information aboutthe state of public order in India following the action taken againstCongress. Reference was made to the sensational character ofsome of the reports which were being sent by newspaper corres-coorespondents to this country and to the United States. It wassuggested that the Government of India might ask Press represen-tatives in India to exercise discretion, not only in what was published in India, but also in messages sent abroad..   :      &apos; * Vide BP.

The Secretary of State for India said that the Viceroy had thought it advisable to ascertain the views Of the ProvincialGovernors regarding the attitude to be adopted if Gandhi fastedwhile Under detention. With&quot; one exception, all the Governors had expressed the view that, whatever the disadvantages of releasingGandhi, they would be outweighed by those of allowing him to dieunder detention. His death while under detention would, in their view, have a deplorable effect on all shades of Indian opinion. The&apos;Viceroy&apos;s final views on this question had not yet been received.In the course of a preliminary discussion, it was pointed outthat this question ought not to be considered on the basis of theobligations which a Government has for safeguarding the life and health of a person undergoing a sentence of imprisonment. Gandhiwas being treated as a detenu, and the conditions of his detentionwere not comparable with those of imprisonment. The object in placing him under restraint was to prevent him from carrying onthe campaign which he and Congress had initiated, and he need notbe subjected to any greater degree of detention than was necessaryfor the purpose of securing that object. It should be possible to devise some method of detaining him which, while preventing him from carrying on his campaign, would leave the Government ofIndia free of responsibility for safeguarding his life and health.The War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for India to put these considerations to the Viceroy and to ask him what arrangements he proposed to make with a view to meetingthem.Great George Street, S.W.1,August 10, 1942.
