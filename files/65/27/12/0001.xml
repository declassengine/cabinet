On behalf of the War Cabinet, the Prime Ministerextended a warm welcome to Mr. Nash, the accredited representa-tive of the New Zealand Government.2. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.In spite of indifferent weather, Bomber Command had been active. Three good attacks had been carried out on Duisburgduring the week. The previous night there had been a heavy attackon Hamburg.Coastal Command had made eight attacks on U-boats, one being promising.Fighter Command continued to engage ground targets inFrance.  At least twelve railway engines had been hit.Total enemy losses for the week amounted to 28 machines forcertain, 5 probable and 17 damaged. We had lost 26 fighters,1 Army Co-operation aircraft, 64 bombers and 5 Coastal command aircraft.The scale of attack on Malta had increased. The enemy had lost 20 machines for certain, 8 probable and 16 damaged. We had lost 9 aircraft destroyed and 9 damaged.There had been considerable air activity, fluctuating with thestate of the land battle. We had also attacked enemy aerodromes,ports and shipping. Nine ships were estimated to have been hit.Enemy losses amounted to 32 machines for certain (including 9 onthe ground), 5 probable and 111 damaged (including 87 on theground). Our losses amounted to 40 machines destroyed and10 damaged.Shipping losses in the past week (including belated reports)amounted to 84,000 tons.The First Lord of the Admiralty was asked to report on thecircumstances of a case in which it was alleged that the captain of a United States ship had disobeyed the pilot&apos;s orders, with theresult that his ship had broken the lock-gates at Newport, therebycausing congestion in the port.General Auchinleck had that morning launched an attack ona considerable scale on the northern sector of the Western Desertfront.   We had secured pur first objectives.The War Cabinet were given information about our own andthe enemy&apos;s comparative strength in tanks.In spite of Russian counter-attacks, the Germans maintaineda bridgehead over the Don on the Voronezh sector. The enemy had reached the Don West of Stalingrad, and were estimated to have crossed the river at four points lower down. The situation was undoubtedly serious.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Air Policy. 3    The Secretary of State for Air reminded the War CabinetAttacks on that under their previous decisions attacks on trains in Occupiedtrains in France could only be carried out subject to certain limiting con-Occupied ditions.   He now asked for authority for both bomber and fighterFrance. aircraft to attack trains in Occupied France by night as well as by(Previous day, whether stationary or moving.Reference: Nine-tenths of the night traffic consisted of goods trains, andW.M. (41) 104th Frenchmen might only travel by night after obtaining specialConclusions,      permission from the German authorities.Minute 2.) After discussion, the War Cabinet-. (i) Gave the authority asked for by the Secretary of Statefor Air.(ii) Suggested that, after the first night attack had beencarried out, warnings should be given by broadcast andby leaflet that these attacks would be continued.[24159]
Supplies toRussia.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 95thConclusions,Minute 2.)Air Raids.Damage and casualties.(previous reference:W.M. (42 ) 83rdConclusions,Minute 3.)4. A discussion took place, which is recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.5. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gave the following information : There had been a sharp attack on Middlesbrough on the night of the 25th/26th July, with substantial damage to property. the plant of Imperial Chemical Industries at Billingham had also suffered damage which would involve some interruption ofproduction.The outstanding event of the week had, however, been the daylight attack in the early morning of the 27th July. Thoughonly about 25 aircraft had crossed the coast, the attack had beenvery widespread. There had been air-raid warnings in all Regions,except Scotland and the Northern Region, and bombs had been dropped in most Regions. Damage had occurred at the Rolls-Royceworks at Derby, at Crittalls at Witham in Essex, and at the GreatWestern Railway workshops at Swindon.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Eire.Co-operationwith EireArmy.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 38thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The War Cabinet discussed two proposals designed tosupport the military authorities in Eire : (a) That officers of the Eire Army should be allowed to attendcourses at the Battle School in Northern Ireland; and(b) That certain limited supplies of arms and munitions shouldbe provided for the use of the military authorities in eire.As regards the first of these proposals, the general feeling ofthe War Cabinet was that, subject to the views of the Governmentof Northern Ireland, there would be no objection to giving facilities to enable officers of the Eire Army to attend these courses.As regards the supply of arms, objection was raised in respectof some of the items which it was proposed to furnish. there seemed to be no advantage ki supplying mines for use in Eire ports;and, while it was in our interests to encourage the militaryauthorities in Eire to make themselves as efficient as possible, it wasnot clear that we could afford to give Eire anti-aircraft guns andpredictors while the defences of our aerodromes in this country were not complete. The advantages of making some military supplies available to Eire were, however, i*ecognised.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary to verify that the Governmentof Northern Ireland would have no objection to officersof the Eire Army attending courses in Northern Ireland.(2) Asked the Chiefs of Staff to consider whether, political considerations apart, it would be in our interest on military grounds to supply Eire with the limited amountof arms arid munitions for which they had asked.
3rs36th-7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (W.P. (42) 307) regarding the proposal that Indian Commissioned Officers should be given the same powersof punishment over British Service personnel as those possessed by indians holding King&apos;s Commissions.The Secretary of State for India ^supported the view of theViceroy and the Commander-in-Chief in India that it wasinexpedient to continue to withhold these powers of punishmentfrom Indian Commissioned Officers who were thought fit to exercisepowers of command.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Council were ready to accept the proposals of the Government of India.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, while theAdmiralty&apos;s orders regarding tho powers of command of officers ofthe Royal Indian Navy contained no restriction regarding powersof punishment, the question did not in practice arise in the IndianNavy, as there were no ships in which Europeans served underIndian officers.The Secretary of State for War took the view that, while we might ultimately have to concede the power of punishment to indian Commissioned Officers, it would be most inexpedient to make this concession at the present time.After discussion, the War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for India, in consultationwith the Secretaries of State for War and Air, to submit a further memorandum indicating how far this problem was one of immediate practical importance and showing,in particular       &apos;(i) the number of Indian Officers holding King&apos;s Corn-missions; Jaa.cILcl t-u(ii) the number holding vSSorojro Commissions who hadalready,  or  would  shortly,   reach  positions  ofseniority in which, if they held King&apos;s Commis-sions, they would ordinarily exercise powers of punishment; and(iii) whether the change proposed would require legisla-tion, either in this country or in India.8. The Secretary of State for India said that the Viceroydesired that a statement should be made on behalf of the Govern-ment which would be a warning to the Congress Working Committee9lst before their meeting early next month. He would be glad if theWar Cabinet would authorise him to make a statement on these lines in reply to a Question in the House of Commons on Thursday.The War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for India to arrange for the text of the statement which he desired to make to be circulated forthwith to War Cabinet Ministers.* if ministers had any comments to offer on the terms of thestatement, they should communicate them to the Secretaryduring the course of the following day, and the PrimeMinister would then decide whether it was necessary forthe proposed statement to be discussed at a meeting of theWar Cabinet.* Subsequently circulated as W.P. (42) 319.
B.B.C.Eeduetion of hours of broadcasting.9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Information (W.P. (42) 312) proposing that theB.B.C.&apos;s Home Service should close down at 10-30 p.m. instead ofat midnight, as from the end of September 1942.The Minister of Information emphasised that this proposal was put forward on the ground that the closing down of the B.B.C.at 10 - 30 nightly would be a constant reminder to the public as awhole of the urgent need for fuel economy.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the actual fuelsaving on transmission would be very small, possibly not more than300 tons. The saying to be gained on reception, or through peoplegoing to bed earlier, was speculative. Moreover, importance was attached to the late B.B.C. News in respect of, e:g., workers on lateshift.The War Cabinet-Decided that, on balance, this proposal should not be proceeded with.government contracts.Report by the comptroller and auditor-General.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 91stConclusions,Minute 5.)10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Mr. Kendall,M.P., the Managing Director of the firm known as British Marc,had made a statement which had been published in the Press, to theeffect that the Report of the Public Accounts Committee on hisfirm looked like inspired criticism. The question whether this statement was a breach of privilege would almost certainly beraised in the House; there might also be a demand for a debate onthe Report from the Committee of Public Accounts, which might take place on the Appropriation Bill.He thought that, if the attitude adopted by the Public accounts committee was called in question, the Chairman of the Committeewas the proper person1; to reply. If the action of the Departmentsconcerned was raised, it would be for the Minister concerned todeal with the matter. The Committee&apos;s recommendations in regardto the transactions with British Marc was that &apos;&apos; the whole mattercalls for early adjustment between the Company and the Depart-ments.&quot;   This recommendation would be acted upon.The War Cabinet took note, with, approval, of this statement.United States ofAmerica.jurisdiction over members ofUnited StatesArmed Forcesin the UnitedKingdom.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 50thConclusions,Minute 5.)11. The Lord Privy Seal said that, under present arrange-ments, it was proposed that the Bill which had been drafted toenable United States Tribunals in this country to deal with alloffences against the Criminal Law committed by American forcesin the United Kingdom would have passed through the House ofLords on Thursday, the 30th July. It was urgently necessary thatthe Bill should be passed into law before the Recess.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security strongly supported this view. Serious cases had already arisen, and he was having great difficulty in dealing with the matter in default of thepassage of this Bill into law.The War Cabinet-Agreed that steps should be taken to secure the passage ofthis Bill into law before the Recess, if possible by sittinga little later on each day. It was also desirable that, ifpossible, the Bill should reach the House of Commons fromthe Lords a day earlier than was at present proposed.
Parliament. 12.   Attention was drawn to a statement which had appeared in several newspapers that morning to the effect that the Prime.  Minister would make a statement oh the war situation before the recess.The War Cabinet was informed that this statement was whollyunauthorised and without foundation.The Minister of Information was asked to make it knownto the Press that the Prime Minister did not propose tomake any statement on the war situation before the Recessunless a situation should arise which rendered a statementdesirable.Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 27, 1942.
