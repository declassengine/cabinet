The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thelast week. 1 &apos; .      ,Night raids had been carried out on Saarlautern, Karlsruhe,Bremen and Duisburg, all of which might be considered satisfactory&apos;.1,750 tons of bombs had been dropped during the week. aircraft of the American Bomber Command had dropped 150 tons of bombs in Occupied Territory. Coastal Command had made attacks on13 U-boats, 2 of which had been promising. Fighter command had been occupied mainly in escorting day bombers. The total figure of enemy losses had been 16 destroyed, 3 probably destroyed and 16 damaged. Our losses had been 11 fighters, 34 bombers and7 Coastal Command aircraft.There had been little air activity over Malta.Air activity in Egypt had been on a big scale and our Air Force,including a number of United States aircraft flying with us, had carried out some 3,800 sorties. The effort had been directed mainlyagainst the German Army, on which heavy losses had been inflicted,especially in motor transport. Enemy aerodromes, shipping andTobruk Harbour had also been attacked. Satisfactory results hadbeen obtained against enemy shipping bringing supplies to Africa,3 ships being sunk and 7 (including 1 destroyer) damaged. enemy losses in this theatre had been 67 destroyed, 30 probably destroyed and 55 damaged. Our losses had been 63 destroyed and 23 damaged.Three of our destroyers had sunk a U-boat near Barbados,taking 49 prisoners. Several other good attacks against U-boatshad been reported, and one damaged U-boat had put in atSantander.A motor torpedo boat had raided the Casquets Lighthouse and taken a number of prisoners.Merchant shipping losses during the past week had amountedto 55,000 tons. Belated reports of losses brought the total up to114,000 tons.       ,f,The War Cabinet were given a summary of the recent fighting in Egypt. No detailed information about casualties was yet available, but it was thought that our losses were light. Asregards material, Rommel had lost about 80 tanks, and very largenumbers of motor vehicles. We had lost 52 tanks, but we remained in possession of the battlefield, and a number of these might therefore be reconditioned. The enemy front was now being heldby Italians while the German Forces were withdrawn to regroupand refit.In New Guinea mopping-up operations continued, but therehad been signs of Japanese reinforcements in this area.In the Solomons there had been signs that the Japanese were preparing another counter-attack.In spite of the intense fighting around Stalingrad, only smallalterations in the line had taken place during the previous week.Further south the Germans were making serious attacks towardsGrozny, but these apparently were being held. In the CaucasusMountains the Germans had made a slight advance. The loss ofNovorossisk (which the Germans claimed to have captured) wouldbe serious.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.2. The Foreign Secretary said that he had suggested, somemonths ago, that we might consider the future of our extra-territorial rights in China, but at that time both our ambassador in China and the United States Government had taken the viewthat the time was inopportune for negotiations with the Chineseon this question.The United States Government had now indicated, however,that they wished to take this matter up, and had suggested that we might join with them in a combined approach to the ChineseGovernment. Provided that it was understood that Treatyquestions affecting our post-war trade would be allowed to stand[24324] -    - b 2Foreign Affairs.China.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 119thConclusions,Minute 7.)
over until after the war, there were great advantages to us inopening discussions on the question of extra-territoriality: nowjointly with the United States Government; and the foreign secretary proposed that we; should accept, on this basis, thesuggestion made on behalf of the United States Government.The War Cabinet-Approved this proposal in principle, and took note thatthe Foreign Secretary would circulate a memorandum explaining in greater detail the scope and purpose of theproposed discussions.Turkey. The Foreign Secretary drew attention to a recent telegram from(Previous Angora (No. 1596, dated the 29th August, 1942) regarding the reference:        disappointment of the Turkish Government on learning that theW.M (42) 119th Turkish pilots now undergoing training in the United Kingdom&apos;Conclusions      could not be given operational training.   It was explained that to minute 5.)        Put tnese pilots through the ordinary course of operational traininggiven to fighter pilots in the R.A.F. would involve their acquiringdetailed information regarding the organisation of the Air Defenceof Great Britain and other secret information which we were notprepared to give to these Turkish pilots, not all of whom were wholly reliable.  The Air Ministry had now arranged, however, forthese pilots to undergo a modified form of operational training, inwhich they would learn to fly and fight modern types of operational aircraft.   It was agreed that this new arrangement should suffice to meet the views of the Turkish Government in this matter.The War Cabinet invited the Secretary of State for air to explain these arrangements to the Turkish Ambassador.Supplies for russia.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 110thConclusions,Minute 2.)Syria.The Foreign Secretary said that the Russian Government were seriously concerned about the mobility of their armies. On this account they had asked that, in sending supplies to them, we should now give lorries precedence over tanks. He would deal with thismatter through the Allied Supplies Executive. They had also asked whether there were any prospects of obtaining, substantial numbers of transport aircraft, but he feared that this was a demandwhich neither we nor the United States were in a position to meet.The Foreign Secretary reminded the War Cabinet that a subsidy was paid by the Exchequer towards the expenses of theFighting French authorities in Syria. He said that, in view of the unsatisfactory attitude of those authorities, he was proposing to consult with the Chancellor of the Exchequer with a view tosuspending payment of this subsidy, for the time being.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.India.Detention of gandhi.(previous references:&quot;W.M. (42) 113thConclusions,Minute 8; andW.M. (42) 119thConclusions,Minute 9:)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (W.P. (42) 394) containing theViceroy&apos;s reply to the suggestion, made at the Meeting of the WarCabinet on the 17th August, that the conditions of Gandhi&apos;sdetention should be modified in such a way as to relieve the Govern-ment of India of responsibility for safeguarding his life and health, and thus to enable them, if.he chose to fast, to leave him totake the consequences.The Viceroy did not propose any immediate change in theconditions of Gandhi&apos;s detention, but suggested that, if Gandhibegan to fast, his eldest son, Devadas Gandhi, should be sent to joinhim in the Aga Khah&apos;s Palace at Poona and should be made responsible for all arrangements inside the Palace and for Gandhi&apos;shealth. The Government of India would provide all facilities for
-DiplomaticDocuments.proposed publication ofDocumentsIllustratingAnglo-german relations,19-25-39.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 122ndConclusions,Minute 9.)4. At their Meeting on the 1st December, 1941. the WarCabinet had considered a proposal by the Foreign Secretary(W.P. (G) (41) 139) for the publication of documents giving a comprehensive account of Anglo-German Relations from 1925 to1939. The War Cabinet had postponed their decision on thisquestion in order that a number of Ministers might read the documents which it was proposed to publish.The War Cabinet now had before them the following-Memoranda containing the comments of Ministers who had read the collection of documents :-W.P. (42) 187 : by the Lord Chancellor.W.P. (42) 376 : by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.W.P. (42) 381 : by the Secretary, Department of OverseasTrade.    -A further Memorandum had also been circulated by the foreign secretary (W.P. (42) 364).The Foreign Secretary said that he strongly favoured theimmediate publication of these documents. His reasons for taking this view were set out in his Memorandum. The point which hemost wished to stress was that, by the publication of this material,we should enable our friends in foreign countries, particularly inthe United States, to clear His Majesty&apos;s Government from thesuspicions current abroad about the objects of British foreignpolicy in the years before the war. In his view, our national interests would be seriously damaged if we continued to refrain from publishing this material.This view was supported by a number of Ministers. On theother side, it was pointed out that very few people would readthrough the whole of this bulky collection of documents, and therewas a risk that the documents would be used mainly by publicistsand others who were concerned to quote only particular documents,or parts of documents, which supported a pre-conceived theory.While careful study of the&apos;whole series of documents would, nodoubt, clear His Majesty&apos;s Government of some of the chargesbrought against them, there were many particular documents:   medical treatment, &amp;c, but it would be made clear that the responsi- &quot;4bility for Gandhi&apos;s life and health during a fast would rest withhimself and his son.The Viceroy&apos;s telegram indicated that, while the Press wouldbe wholly excluded, no Objection would be raised to Gandhi seeinga reasonable number of visitors or friends from outside. On. this point the &quot;Viceroy had explained, in a further telegram(No. 329-S.C, dated the 4th September), that all visitors admitted to the Palace would be required to enter into a bond not to makeany public statement based upon their visits.In discussion, it was pointed out that the disadvantages of allowing Gandhi to receive visitors were not limited to the risk ofpublic statements, whether in the Press or otherwise, based on thesevisits. There was also the risk that by this means Gandhi wouldbe able to maintain communication with agents outside, and thuscontinue to direct his revolutionary campaign.The War Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the arrangements which theViceroy proposed to make if Gandhi began to fast; butasked the Secretary of State for India to impress it uponthe Viceroy that, if such a situation arose, the facilitiesfor visits should be made subject to such restrictions as would effectively limit Gandhi&apos;s freedom to communicate with the outside world.
which, torn front their context, could be used with damaging effect for the purpose of stirring up old controversies.The War Cabinefs conclusions were : -(1) The documents intended for publication should be finallyselected, indexed and prepared for publication. a shorter summary collection, which had also been planned,should similarly be got ready for publication.(2) None of these volumes should, however, be publishedwithout further authority from the War Cabinet.FightingServices.Pay and allowances.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 114thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. On the 20th August the War Cabinet had asked the lord presidents Committee to consider whether there was any case, on merits, for increases in Service pay or allowances.The Lord President of the Council said that his Committeehad held two meetings on this subject, and had arranged for certain aspects of the matter to be considered by a Committee of officialsrepresenting the Treasury, the three Service Departments, theMinistry of Home Security and the Ministry of Pensions. As aresult of their enquiries, the Lord Presidents Committee had unanimously decided to recommend the following improvements in service pay and allowances : Other Ranks.(a) The existing additional War Pay of Ss.&apos;Qd. a week, whichwas granted to alFother ranks in August 1940, should be increasedto 7s.(b) Members of the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services should participate in this improvement in War Pay, the increase in their case (on the normal proportionate basis) being 2s. &amp;d. a week.(c) Children&apos;s allowances should be increased as follows: First childSecond childThird    and    subsequent children......Present Rates. Proposed Rates,s.   d. 8.   d.8   6 9   66   6 8   65   07   6Officers. ,(a) There should be no general increase in pay, but the firstpromotion (from Second Lieutenant in the. Army and from PilotOfficer in the R.A.F.) should be given, as a general rule, at the endof a probationary period of 6 months from the date of Commission,instead of the present periods of 18 months in the Army and12 months in the R.A.F.This concession of accelerated promotion from the lowestcommissioned rank could not be applied to the Royal ,Navy owingto certain differences in Service conditions; but means were being-devised of giving an equivalent benefit to the corresponding ranks in the Royal Navy.(b) Allowances for junior officers with children should be improved by revision of the Code of Officers&apos; Family Allowancesannounced in the House of Commons on the 9th September, 1941.The following improvements should apply to officers up to and including Captains in the Army,, and to the corresponding ranks in the other Services :-  .Present rateper day.,s.   d.Wife   ,-. ...      ...Wife and 1 child ...Wife and 2 childrenWife and 3 children46780066Proposed rateper day.s.   d..4   0.708   69   6With Is; a day increase for each additional child.
11 W.M. 121 (42).(c) Certain minor concessions should be made to officers of theArmy and R.A.F. who still draw family allowances under the oldCode. These officers, when separated from their families, are provided with lodging, fuel and light for themselves or receive,in lieu, allowances at the rates prescribed for single officers; and, inaddition, they are granted a consolidated family allowance whichis less than the sum of the allowances received when they are livingwith their families. It was proposed to increase the consolidatedallowances to approximately the same figure as the allowances givento officers living with their families in the case of Lieutenants and second Lieutenants, and to reduce the disparity by Is. in the caseof Captains and Majors (with corresponding adjustments forR.A.F. officers).  The effect would be as follows: Approx.Allowances Present Proposedwhen living Separated Separatedapart. Rate.

JThe total cost of all these concessions would be nearly  50m.a year.The War Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the conclusions reached by &quot;the Lord presidents committee, as summarised above.(2) Took note that the Lord Presidents Committee would holda special meeting on Wednesday, the 9th September,for the purpose of settling the concessions to be madeto junior Naval officers, to correspond with the accelerated promotion to be granted in the Army andthe R.A.F.(3) Agreed that the improvements summarised above, togetherwith the final decision regarding the pay of junior naval officers, should be announced by the Government spokes-man at the outset of the Debate in the House ofCommons on the 10th September.127JUr Transport.Allocation ofAir.

(42) 390) setting out revised arrangements for allocating space in aircraft on the regular air transport services.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of the new arrangements outlined in this Memorandum.Production. 7    The War Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by the LordAppointment of President of the Council and the Minister of ProductionScientific (W.P.
