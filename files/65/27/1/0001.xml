The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff said that there were &quot;over100 Boston&quot; aircraft in Basra or Iraq en route to Russia, of which29 were ready for delivery. It was for consideration whether, inview of the military situation in the Middle East, we should ask whether the Russians would agree to the diversion of, say, 50 to theMiddle East. The great advantage of this course would be that aconsiderable number could arrive within three or four days, and could be utilised by two squadrons which were at present withoutlight bomber aircraft-. The numbers of Boston bombers which theMiddle East were scheduled to receive in each of the next four months averaged less than 10 a month, which was inadequate tcmeet normal wastage.In discussion, the view expressed was that, as the russians were engaged in heavy fighting, it would be difficult for us to put this request to the Russian Government. No objection was seen,however, to the United States authorities asking the Russianswhether they would agree to the diversion of certain of these aircraft to the Middle East, subject to their being replaced later.The War Cabinet were also given details of the Blenheimaircraft now en route to the Middle East. The question was raised whether arrangements could be made for more aircraft of this typeto be sent by the Takoradi route, instead of going round the Cape.The War Cabinet (1) Invited the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff to draft a telegramfor the Prime Minister to send to President Rooseveltexplaining our need of Boston aircraft in the middle east, and asking whether he would be willing to suggest to the Russians an immediate diversion to that area of up to 50 aircraft of this type.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to ascertain whethergreater use could be made of the Takoradi route for thedespatch of Blenheim aircraft to the Middle East, andto submit a report on this point to the Prime Minister.2. A short discussion ensued on the position in Egypt, whichi* recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave the WarCabinet an outline of the ways in which the military situation inthe Middle East might develop.4. The Foreign Secretary informed the War Cabinet of theterms of a communication which he proposed to send to our ambassador to Russia before he left Russia on his visit to thiscountry.A record of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement is contained inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to send a communication to our Ambassador to the Soviet Union in the sense proposed.Great George Street, S.

(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).MOST SECRET.COPY NO.MIDDLE EASTMilitary-Situation.(previotisReference:W.M.(42)81stConclusions,Minute 2).W.M.(42) 85TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 3.Confidential Record.(3rd July, 1942 - 12 Noon).(No circulation)THE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF gave theWar Cabinet a stunmary of the main points which had emerged from an enquiry which the Chiefs of Staff were making about the possible course of events in the middle east and the action which it was open to us to take incertain circumstances.If the El Alamein line was pierced, Rommel couldeither strike East or South but, owing to the fact that theDelta was unsuitable for operations by armoured forces,he would have to use infantry, and this wotild give us anopportunity to meet him on equal terms.     If the enemymade his main thrust to the South towards Cairo, he wotildmeet the Army which had been organised in the Delta andthe 8th Army would be well placed to harass his communications.     Similarly, if the enemy kept on towardsAlexandria, the Delta Army   could attack his&quot;flank.The Chiefs of Staff had had, however, to consider what might happen if our forces were driven out of Egypt.It appeared that our communications to the East of the canal and the Red Sea were sufficient to maintain a forceof 5 Divisions, and the comrauni cat ions to the South,through the ports on the Western littoral of the Red Seawould be sufficient for 6 Divisions, making a total of11 Divisions in all.The Chiefs of Staff took the view that the enemy&apos;s most likely course was to push on to the East, with a viewto occupying Palestine and Syria and &quot;freezing&quot; Turkey.There were plenty of aerodromes to the South of the canal and in the Palestine-Syria area, but aerodromes weresparse in Sinai.The Chiefs of Staff were in the course of preparing a comprehensive review of the situation which might arise if things went badly for us.     This would include an assess-ment of the naval forces which could be left behind in theMediterranean.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL S TAFF thenexplained the general scheme of demolitions if the worstcame to the worst.     A comprehensive list had been prepared in the Middle East and this had been checked with a similarlist which had been put together by the Chiefs of Staff.The lists corresponded closely except on two points.The Middle East put the destruction of irrigation plants,including the Aswan Dam in Category &apos;A&apos;, whereas the demolition of cotton was placed in Category &apos;B&apos;.     TheChiefs of Staff considered that the destruction of damsshould not be entertained at present, but that the ginningfactories should receive the highest priority..    they proposed to instruct the Commanders-in7Chief accordingly.Great George Street, S.W.1
