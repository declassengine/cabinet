The Shipping The War Cabinet had under consideration the followingSituation.        Memoranda on the shipping situation : (Previous .Reference- Review of the War Situation Memorandum by the PrimeW.M. (42) 92nd Minister (W.P. (42) 311).Conclusions, Memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilMinute 2.) (W.P. (42) 294).First and Second Reports of the Shipping Committee(W.P. (42) 293 and 310).Statistics  relating  to the  Shipping  Situation  (W.P.(42) 316).The broad picture presented by these Memoranda was that, overthe eighteen months from the beginning of 1942 to the end ofJune 1943, non-tanker imports into this country might be expectedto total 33 million tons, while the consumption of imported food andraw materials would, if consumption policy remained unchanged,total 41 - 4 million tons. To bridge the gap of 8 - 4 million tons, itwas suggested that stocks might be run down by 4 million tons, andthat various consumption economies might be introduced whichwould produce a saving of 1 - 4 million tons of imports during theperiod. In order to close the remainder of the gap, it was recom-mended that the United States authorities should be pressed toincrease the tonnage of shipping to be allocated to areas for whichwe were responsible so as to enable us to bring in an additional3 million tons of imports during the first half of 1943.The War Cabinet held a preliminary discussion of theseproposals, in the course of which the following points were raised : (a) The Minister of War Transport said that in his negotia-tions with the American authorities regarding the shippingrequirements for the Bolero movement, he was asking for further assistance from American shipping to the extent of 500,000 grosstons in the period of nine months from the 1st July, 1942, to the31st March, 1943, and 1,500,000 gross tons in the second period of nine months from the 1st April, 1943, to the 31st December, 1943.If this assistance were forthcoming, he estimated that over thatperiod of eighteen months it would be possible to increase our imports by rather more than 7 million tons. Although the periodof his calculations was different, the additional shipping which hewas asking the American authorities to provide would serve tobridge the gap of 3 million tons of imports in the period of eighteen months ending the 30th June, 1943.The Prime Minister said that our approach to the UnitedStates authorities must be put on the basis that sufficient shippingmust be provided to enable us to import 25 million tons in 1942 and27 million tons in 1943. . These import programmes must beregarded as irreducible minima, and must have the first call on theshipping available.Shipping for the Bolero movement must rank second inpriority to the requirements of this import programme, for theBolero requirements were subject to variation if not in quantity,at any rate in time. The completion date of the Bolero movementcould, if necessary, be postponed for one or two months if it became necessary to use the shipping which would be set free by such a postponement for fulfilling the needs of our minimum import programme.Scales of equip- (6) It was already clear that there would not be enoughment, &amp;c, for shipping to complete the Bolero movement unless the UnitedUnited States States authorities revised their scales.of Army equipment andForces. maintenance.   Even if the initial equipment was cut from 9 tons[24167-1] B 2Assistance from united Statesshipping.
Economies byBritish Forces.Use ofShipping.Use ofMan-power.Use of motor vehicles.to 6 tons per man, there would not be sufficient shipping to transport and maintain the numbers originally contemplated; Inthe light of our own experience, it seemed likely that the UnitedStates Army were working to excessive scales in such matters asrequirements of ammunition per unit.The Minister of Production said that he had already arranged for these matters to be taken up with the United States Armyauthorities in Washington. He was also exploring the possibilityof securing further shipping economies through interchangeabilityof equipment, on the basis that American troops operating fromhere would make the maximum use of equipment produced in thiscountry, while comparable equipment produced in the United states would be shipped direct to overseas theatres of war for use byBritish or American troops. It would also be necessary to persuade the Americans to reduce the scale of their stores and equipment.(c) The need for these economies could be represented moreforcibly to the American authorities if we ourselves had taken stepsto enforce still further economies by our own fighting Services.There was room for further economy in the use of shipping formilitary purposes. Though much progress had been made in recent,months, there were still greater savings in shipping space to besecured through improved packing of vehicles. The methods whichhad been applied with success to the packing of load-carryingvehicles might profitably be extended to other types of vehicle, andpossibly to guns and other articles of equipment. In general, theServices must find means of securing an overall economy in their useof shipping space.The Prime Minister said that, as our Forces now had to fightoverseas, it was essential that they should learn to travel light. it followed that further measures must be taken to cut down to the bare minimum the establishments of the rearward formations.There must be a searching enquiry into the use of man-power in thethree Services with a view to reducing the numbers of ancillary and non-combatant personnel, thereby facilitating any necessaryincreases in combatant troops. An enquiry into this question shouldbe held by a Committee of Cabinet Ministers.The Secretary of State for War said that the Prime minister had previously carried out a similar scrutiny of Army establish-ments when the size of the Army had been determined. It wouldprobably be found to be difficult to secure any substantial further reduction in the numbers of ancillary troops, since the Army&apos;s newtask of undertaking operations overseas called for a larger com-complement of ancillary troops. He suggested that, if a further enquiry was to be held by a Committee of War Cabinet Ministers,the procedure must be to fix the global total to which establishmentsshould be related, and to leave the military authorities to work outthe numbers of particular establishments in relation to that total.It would not be practicable for such a Committee to scrutinise thestrength of particular units and establishments in detail.Eef erence was also made to an enquiry into the scale of provision of motor transport for the British Army. The Secretaryof State for War explained that the scope of this enquiry had been altered in the light of the new strategical role of the Army, and theReport had only just reached him. The Prime Minister hoped that,as a result of this Report, some substantial reduction might be madein the numbers of motor vehicles supplied to the Army, and he asked that proposals should be submitted to the War Cabinet assoon as the Report had been Considered.

The main arguments infavour of this course were (i) That there was serious waste, considerable quantities of bread being fed to poultry,(ii) That the saving in shipping tonnage would be con-siderable.(iii) That the rationing of bread would have a powerful effect- on the United States and would facilitate our negotia-tions with them on shipping matters.The Minister of Food explained that, so long as bread wasunrationed, it provided a &quot; cushion &quot; which enabled the variousneeds of the different classes of the community to be met.The possibility of rationing bread in conjunction with thepoints scheme had been considered by the Lord presidents committee, but the decision so far had been that, while a scheme should be kept ready for use in case of emergency, it should not beadopted at present.It was agreed that this matter should be further considered bythe Lord Presidents Committee.(e) The question was raised whether we ought to increase themerchant shipbuilding programme.The Minister of War Transport thought that it would bebetter that any increase in the merchant shipbuilding programme should be concentrated in the United States rather than that weshould import additional steel to build more ships here.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that any surplusshipbuilding capacity in this country had better be devoted to building additional escort vessels and auxiliary aircraft-carriersrather than to merchant shipbuilding.The question was raised whether we could use in this countryany of the new methods which had been applied so successfully inAmerica.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that enquiry had shownthat on the sites available it was not practicable to apply the new methods of shipbuilding in this country except at the cost ofdeflecting war effort from other essential war industries. If the shipbuilding programme was to be extended, it would be better tobring into use certain yards not at present employed.Reference was made to the experiments in building concreteships.The First Lord said that barges and small craft were now beingmade of concrete, and the question of building tank-landing craftof concrete was being examined. He undertook, in conjunctionwith the other Departments concerned, to examine a suggestion thatthe specifications for fitting out tank-landing craft, e.g., the crews&apos;quarters, were on a more elaborate scale than was necessary whenaccount was taken of the length of the voyages which these craft were likely to have to undertake.(/) In connection with the agricultural., programme, theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that, while the UnitedStates had provided practically all the extra heavy tractorsrequired, his demand for 1,150 more medium tractors had not been met, except in so far as he might be able to get the temporary loan of some of the 1,200 tractors promised by the United Statesprimarily fOr military use in this country, the precise allocation ofwhich remained to be determined by the authorities here.
The War Cabinet were informed that a number of thesetractors were used by the War Office on building work, excavations,and so forth.   Interdepartmental arrangements were being madefor central consideration of means for securing the best utilisation,of tractors.The War Cabinet reached the following provisional con-clusions: (1) An approach should be made to the United States Govern-ment, asking them to give us a definite undertaking thatthey would allocate to areas for which we were respon-sible sufficient tonnage to enable us to carry through anon-tanker import programme of 25 million tons in 1942 .and 27 million tons in 1943. The Foreign Secretary andthe Minister of War Transport were asked to consult together as to the form which this communication shouldtake and the basis on which it should be stated.It should be made clear that these figures of 25 and27 million tons represented an irreducible minimum andmust have first call on the shipping available.(2) Appropriate measures should be taken to bring home to theUnited States authorities the need for reducing thevolume of stores to be brought to this country in theBolero movement. This matter would primarily be handled by the Minister of War Transport, who was inconsultation with the United States authorities onBolero shipping requirements, and the Minister ofProduction, who would press the Americans to useBritish equipment wherever possible.(3) The War Office and the Air Ministry should continue topress the use of more economical methods of packingvehicles of all types, and should seek means of securing an overall economy in their use of shipping space.(4) The Secretary of Stale for War undertook to report on the economies which the War Office could effect in the scale of provision of Army vehicles.(5) A Cabinet Committee was appointed comprising The Deputy Prime Minister (Chairman),The Lord Privy Seal,The Foreign Secretary,to examine the establishments of the three Services. Theobject of this enquiry would be to reduce the overallnumbers in non-combatant roles, and thus to facilitateany necessary increases in combatant troops.(6.) The following economies in consumption proposed in w.P. (42) 294 were approved : *(a) Increased food yield of the 1942 harvest, 500,000 tons.The Ministers concerned were invited to take all&apos;    necessary steps to obtain this extra amount offood off the farms.(6.) The dilution of bread, to the extent of 5 per cent.,with oats and potato flour, the estimated import saving being up to 300,000 tons.(c) Economies  in  steel and steel-making materials,400,000 tons.(d) Economies    in    materials    other    than    steel,200,000 tons.(7) The Lord Presidents Committee were invited to examine further the question whether bread should be rationed,and to report to the War Cabinet-
(8) The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook (a) To obtain a report from the United States as to the experiments in building concrete ships.(b) To examine, in consultation with the other Depart-ments concerned, whether the standard adoptedin fitting out tank-landing craft was unneces-sarily elaborate.(9) The discussion would be resumed at a further meeting in,say, a week&apos;s time,* when the various points raisedwould be further considered in the light of reports to be furnished by the Ministers concerned.* At the Meeting of the War Cabinet held on Thursday, the 13th August(W.M. (42) 112, Minute 4), it was agreed that the above Conclusions should be confirmed, and that a further Meeting should be held towards the end ofAugust, when progress should be reported as to the action taken under thevarious heads.Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 29, 1942.
