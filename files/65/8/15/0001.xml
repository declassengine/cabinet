The Permanent  Under-Secretary of State for Foreign(Previous    &apos;     A ffairs said that the exact position in regard to Sir Robert CraigkVsReference:        discussions with Mr. Arita on the Burma Road question was notW.M.

This communication had been discussed with Mr. Aritawho had told us orally that the Japanese Government were inagreement with our proposals, but no written reply had been madeto our communication.   Some difficulty had arisen about the termsof the communique to be issued.   For example, the Japanese had wished to make no reference in the communique to the fact thatwe agreed to stop traffic on the Burma Road for a period ofthree months.In reply to a question, the Permanent Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs said that he did not anticipate that the JapaneseGovernment would try to make serious trouble, or to back out ofthe agreement which had been reached. We should certainly makeit clear in any statement which we might issue that we had agreedto stop traffic on the Road for a period of three months only.The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign - affairs said that he had seen the Chinese Ambassador the previous day.The latter had suspected that we had given way entirely to theJapanese demands and that the reference to the Road being closedf for three months only had been inserted as a face-saving expedient.He (the Permanent Under-Secretary of State) had made it clear to Mr. Quo that this was not the case. Mr. Quo had been considerably reassured by this answer.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.U.S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 200thConclusions,Minute 14.)3. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to telegramNo. 460 from our Ambassador at Moscow, enquiring the views ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the actual basis upon whichrelations between the U.S.S.R. and Turkey could be improved.Unless he was forearmed in this way, a further approach to theSoviet Government would be interpreted by them as a blank chequeand would encourage them to increase their demands.The War Cabinet agreed with the soundness of this comment.Great caution must be exercised in any attempt on our part toimprove relations between Turkey and Russia. The governingfactor must be the views of the Turkish Government.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 14, 1940.
