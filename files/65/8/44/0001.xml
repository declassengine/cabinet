The Chief of the Air Staff reported that enemy operations on the previous day had been mainly confined to small raids, usuallyby single aircraft along the East and South-east coasts.

The weather had beenbad, but the results had been good. One Hampden had failed toreturn.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had nothing to report.The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that a convoy inthe Straits of Dover was at that moment being shelled by Germanlong range guns from the French coast.

The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs drew attentionItaly_Greece,    to Belgrade telegram No. 598 which stated that the Yugoslav(Previous General Staff had informed our assistant Naval Attache that reference:        Italian troop movements in South Albania had been taking place,W.M. (40) 231st Dut that little importance was attached to them, as relations betweenConclusions,      Italy and Greece had improved during the last three days.   the minute 3.) &apos;      Yugoslav General Staff maintained that these troop movements were an attempt to divert British forces to Crete, and if possible to greece, in view of Italy&apos;s imminent intention to attack Egypt.  TheItalian Military Attache had visited the Yugoslav General staff and had referred to the powerful blow that Italy was on the pointof striking in Egypt.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The exchange position.(previous references:W.M. (39) 11thConclusions,Minutes 5, andW.M. (40) 40thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a most secret memorandum by the.Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (40) 324)dealing with the position of the Gold and Foreign exchange resources available to us for financing the war.A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet-(i) Recorded the view that,- subject to the development of our war effort,- which involves placing large orders in theUnited States, every endeavour must be made to limitdollar expenditure to vital needs.(ii) Invited Ministers in charge of spending Departments toco-operate with the Chancellor of the Exchequer to theutmost extent in carrying out this policy, on the lines indicated by him in his Paper.At the end of the discussion Members of the War Cabinetreturned their copies of W.P. (40) 324 to the Secretary.
JaPan- . 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the internment of Secretary of State for the Colonies as to the instructions to be sent.Japanese in to the Governor at Singapore about the internment - of JapaneseMalay in the (W.P. (40) 320). The point at issue was whether (a) (as proposedevent of by the Chiefs of Staff) the Governor should now be authorised, ifhostilities. Japan had actually embarked on open hostilities against the BritishEmpire with or without any formal declaration of war, to treatJapanese in Malaya as enemy aliens and liable to be interned forth-with : or (&amp;) should the Governor be told that, except in case of adirect attack on Malaya, there should be no general internment of japanese without prior reference to the Secretary of State for theColonies, unless further instructions had been sent in the meantime.The Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary ofState for Foreign A ffairs favoured the latter course. They thoughtthat Japan might take some action against us, and that a confusedor difficult situation might arise which, however, neither theJapanese nor ourselves would wish to see develop into total war.There was always a certain risk that a general authority, asproposed in the alternative (a), would be put into force as the resultof hostile action which need not necessarily lead to war.On the other hand, the view was expressed that the wording of the alternative (6) might well restrict the Governor&apos;s actionsunduly.The Prime Minister thought that it was important that japanese subjects should not be allowed access to fortified areas in malaya. He suggested that action might be taken to declare furtherareas as defended areas, or War Office property, and to prohibitall access to them by Japanese subjects. Such action could be taken immediately, irrespective of any deterioration in the relationsbetween this country and Japan.As a second step, he thought that the Governor should beauthorised to intern all Japanese, if it was quite clear that japan had embarked upon open hostilities against us.There might also be a third stage, namely, that if relationswith Japan became strained, a precautionary or warning telegramwould be sent to the Governor, who would then be authorised tointern all Japanese subjects in the event of action on the part of japan which made it unwise to defer internment any longer.The Foreign Secretary said that he would be satisfied with asolution on the lines indicated, provided that the circumstances which would justify the Governor in interning all Japanese inadvance of the issue of a warning or precautionary telegram were clearly defined.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary&apos;of State for the Colonies and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in consultation withthe Chiefs of Staff, to revise the draft instructions to theOfficer Administering the Government of the straits settlements on this point, in the light of the discussion which had taken place. Provided agreement was reached,the instructions should be despatched without further reference to the War Cabinet.
United States.Supply of destroyers andother munitions of war.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 231stConclusions,Minute 1.)&quot;X&quot;5. The War Cabinet had before them draft telegrams fromthe Prime Minister to the President of the United States and fromthe Prime Minister to the Prime Minister of Canada (W.P. (40)329).The Prime Minister said that a further telegram had now beenreceived from Lord Lothian (No. 1781 from Washington) reporting that he thought some kind of exchange of letters might be necessary.The Prime Minister thought that our attitude should be that, ifthe United States Government found it necessary for their own purposes that there should be some connection between our con-cessions to the United States in regard to base facilities, and the destroyers and other munitions which we were to receive, thisconnection should be established as an act of the American Govern-ment, for which we should not be responsible.General agreement was expressed with this view, but it was thought better not to incorporate a sentence to this effect in thedraft telegram to President Roosevelt.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the draft telegram to the President of the UnitedStates subject to the following amendments :(i) Paragraph 3 should be made of general application,and the reference to Bermuda deleted.(ii) Paragraph 4, line 7. After the words &quot; the Houseof Commons yesterday&apos;&apos; the insertion of thewords &apos;&apos; both on this point and as regards thefuture of the Fleet.&quot;(b) Approved the draft telegram to the Prime Minister ofCanada.(c) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to send a telegram to Lord Lothian, on the lines indicated at&quot;X.&quot;The Allies.Organisation ofAllied Naval,Army and air contingents.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 228thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The War Cabinet had before them the Fourth Report bythe Chiefs of Staff on the Organisation of Allied Naval, Army andAir Contingents (W.P. (40) 325).The Prime Minister mentioned that Mr. Tom Johnston, M.P.,had proposed that Members of the House of Commons should formHospitality Committees in connection with the Allied foreigncontingents now in this country.It was agreed that this suggestion had much to commend it.The War Cabinet Took note of the Report by the Chiefs of Staff.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,August 22, 1940.
