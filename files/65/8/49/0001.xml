agricultural policy.Prices for1910-41.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 235thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theLord Privy Seal (W.P. (G.) (40) 226), the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries (W.P. (G.) (40) 225) and the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Ministry of Food (W.P. (G.) (40) 227).The Lord Privy Seal explained that the Lord presidents committee had reached agreement (the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries dissenting) on a statement of Government Policy on agricultural prices for the coming season. The points on whichthe Minister disagreed with his colleagues were the reductions which were to be made in the prices for fat cattle and for pigs, ascompared with the increased prices which had been in operationsince the 1st July.The following were among the principal points made in thediscussion : (1) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that the farming community was working hard to secureincreased production, and it would be unwise to discourage them by reducing fat cattle prices from111 per cent, above the level of the previous June to per cent, above that level, especially in view of thefact that the increased costs which fell upon the farmer,including wages and the cost of feeding-stuffs, had turned out greater than had been allowed for. The sumof money involved was comparatively small ( 1-7 million). He was mainly concerned with the Autumnfigures and would be prepared, if necessary, to attemptto work down by June 1941 to the prices recommendedby the Lord Presidents Committee.(2) It was stated that milk production would be endangeredby high prices to the fat cattle producer.(3) It had been contemplated in the previous June that thereshould be complete freedom to make such adjustmentsfor 1941, whether upwards or downwards, in the relativeprices of the agricultural products required by thenation, as would be desirable to secure the fulfilment of the food production policy of the Government, andthis position had been reserved in the public announce-ment which had followed. It was suggested that the farmers seemed to contemplate that adjustments should always be upwards, and never downwards.(4) All classes in the community were being called upon tomake sacrifices, and present circumstances did not allow of immunity being given to farmers.After further discussion the War Cabinet -Agreed to the issue of the statement on agricultural pricesrecommended by the Lord Presidents Committee, in theform attached to W.P. (G.) (40) 226.National Day ofPrayer.Suggestedspecial facilitiesfor munitionsworkers.2.   The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that it was impossible to authorise a generalstoppage of work in munitions factories on the occasion of the National Hay of Prayer. Any facilities whichit might be found possible to grant them would have tobe a matter for local arrangement.(2) Noted there had recently been a decrease in the amount of sunday work which munitions workers were called uponto perform.
3. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a draft telegram to Lord Lothian, which had been prepared in the ForeignOffice in accordance with the Conclusions of their Meeting that morning.Certain amendments to the draft were agreed to.The War Cabinet-Approved the draft telegram to Lord Lothian in the formattached as the Appendix to these conclusions.(previous reference:W.M.
