United States of        1.   The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a document7^America. handed to him&apos; by the American Ambassador giving a personalSupply of message from the President of the United States.   The substanceDestroyers. of this message was that the President believed that it might be(Previous possible to furnish the British Government, as immediate assistance,reference: with at least 50 Destroyers, Motor Torpedo Boats, and certainW.M. (40) 221st aircraft, provided the British Government found itself able and conclusions, willing to take the two following steps : The first was an assuranceMinute 3.) &apos; that, if at any time the waters round these Islands became untenablefor British ships of war, the latter would not be turned over toGermany or sunk, but would be sent to other parts of the EmpireProposed grant for the continued defence of the Empire. The second was anof base facilities agreement on the part of Great Britain that the British Governmentin certain would authorise the use of Newfoundland, Bermuda, the Bahamas,British certain West Indian Islands and British Guiana as Naval and AirTerritories. bases by the United States in the event of an attack on the American(Previous Hemisphere by any non-American nation; in the meantime, the reference:        United States should have the right to establish bases, the land for w.M. (40) 214th which should be acquired by purchase or through a lease.M^nute^T&apos; The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the War1 Cabinet a telegram from Lord Lothian (No. I703)f who had been shown by the President the text of his communication toMr. Kennedy. Lord Lothian said that the President found theprevious proposal for bases and flying grounds, in the form proposedby the USA. War Department and agreed by us, too complicated and restricted to convince Congress. Hence the form now proposed.Lord Lothian hoped that we could accept the phrases now suggested.In effect, the United States accepted the thesis that the british fleet, based on Britain, to which the United States contributedDestroyers, was the outer line of defence of Pan-America, and thatour Islands off North America, whose defence would be mainlyfortified by the United States, without transfer of sovereignty, wasthe inner line of defence.The Prime Minister thought that, if the present proposal went through, the United States would have made a long step towardscoming into the war on our,side. To sell Destroyers to a belligerentwas certainly not a neutral action. The 50 Destroyers would beof enormous value to the Admiralty, and the effect of the proposal as a whole on Germany would, he thought, be immense.The crucial point was, he thought, what President Rooseveltwould say publicly in regard to the first assurance asked for. ThePresident said in his message that he did not contemplate any public statement by the Prime Minister, but only an assurance onthe lines indicated, as, for example, reiteration to him (thePresident) of the Prime Minister^ statement to Parliament on the4tJh June. But it must be contemplated that the President mighthave to make some statement to Congress.On the 4th June he (the Prime Minister) had said : &quot; We shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe,this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, thenour Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the british fleet, would carry on the struggle.....&quot;   That statement hadbeen made partly in order to reassure public opinion immediatelyafter the collapse of France. Nothing must now be said which would disturb morale or lead people to think that we should not &quot;fight it out here.The War Cabinet agreed that it was of the utmost importanceto make it absolutely clear that it was our firm resolve to fight it out here, and that even if, contrary to our belief, we should find ourselves being overwhelmed, we should retain entirely unfetteredthe right to decide when (if ever) we should send the Fleet away from these waters to defend our kith and kin overseas.
In discussion, the view was expressed that, if regarded fromthe point of view of the tangible assets which would pass, it couldbe contended that the United States was making a hard bargain.In this connexion it was suggested that we should follow up asuggestion in Lord Lothian&apos;s telegram and press for more flying boats and rifles.Again, the Secretary of State for the Colonies thought that,although under the Presidents proposals sovereignty would notpass, once the right to establish bases had been ceded, the colonies in question would pass under American influence.It was also suggested that negotiations in regard to the leasesof these base facilities were unlikely to lead to an improvement of relations between this country and the United States.On the other hand, the view of the First Lord of the A dmiraltywas that to get 50 destroyers would be of inestimable benefit to us.Moreover, the general view of the War Cabinet was that thepresent proposal could not be looked at merely from the point ofview of the exchange of destroyers, motor torpedo boats and flying,boats for certain facilities by way of naval and air bases. It mightwell prove to be the first step in constituting an Anglo-Saxon blocor indeed a decisive point in history.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thought that thestep proposed would be congenial to the Dominions, who would regard it as consistent with development of the Empire on new lines.Again, the War Cabinet were reminded that, when we hadsurmounted the perils of the war, we should have to look forward to a Peace Conference. Bearing in mind all that had been said asto allowing other countries access to raw materials, and so forth,we might well be in a stronger position if we had laid the founda-tion for a joint trusteeship by the English-speaking peoples. Theline now proposed by President Roosevelt afforded a strikingcontrast to the action taken by the U.S.S.R. and Japan. Further,the effect of this proposal would be all the greater if it came aboutbefore the invasion of Great Britain had been attempted.Reference was made to the position of Newfoundland. It waspointed out that, while the West Indian Islands, the Bahamas andBermudas, were the outposts of the United States, Newfoundlandwas the outpost of Canada, which had special interests in theBotwood aerodrome. It would be necessary that Canada and New-foundland should be consulted before we were finally committed tothe present proposal.The War Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that an affirmative answer should besent to President roosevelt&apos;s proposals.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to draft the text of an interim reply to be despatched by thePrime Minister that evening. This interim reply should indicate that we were in favour of the scheme, but mustconsult the Governments of Canada and Newfoundlandbefore finally signifying our acceptance.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, acting in consultation with the Foreign Secretary, to ascertain the views of the Governments of Canada and New-foundland to that part of the proposal which related to the grant of base facilities to the United States in newfoundland.
MilitaryOperations.Somaliland.(Previous&apos;Reference:W.M. (40) 226thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Secretary of State for War read a telegram from the acting Commander-in-Chief, Middle East. The enemy had againattacked our forward posts on the Tug-Argan position, but their efforts had been half-hearted and the attack had slackened. enemy aircraft continued to attack Berbera with bombs and machine-gunfire. Further reinforcements were on the way, but in the meantime the position was rather anxious.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,August 14, 1940.
COPY. EMBASSY OP THEUNITED STATES OP AMERICA.idESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT T    FORMER KAVAL PERSON.I have been studying very carefully the message transmitted to me through the British Ambassador in Washington on August 8,and. I have also been considering the possibility of furnishingthe assistance in the way of releases and priorities containedin the memorandum attached, to your message.It is my belief that it may be possible to furnish to theBritish Government as immediate assistance at least 50destroyers, the motor torpedo boats heretofore referred to, and,insofar as airplanes are concerned,  5 planes of each of the categories mentioned, the latter to be furnished for war testingpurposes.    Such assistance, as I am sure you will understand,would only be furnished if the American people and the Congressfrankly recognised that in return therefor the. national answer was made and security of the United States would be enhanced.For that reason it would be necessary, in the event that itpx&apos;oves possible to release the material above mentioned, that theBritish Government find itself able and willing to take thetwo following steps:1.    Assurance on the part of the Prime Minister that in theevent that the waters of Great Britain become untenable forBritish ships of war, the latter would not be turned over to theGermans or sunk, but would be sent to other parts of the Empirefor continued defense of the Empire.2.      An agreement on the part of Great Britain that theBritish Government would authorize the use of Newfoundland,Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jamaica. St. Lucia, Trinidad and british guiana as naval and air bases by the United States in the eventof an attack on the American hemisphere by any non-Americannation?    and in the meantime the United States to have the rightto

to establish bes-.es and to use them for training and exercisepurposes with the understanding that the land necessary forthe above could be acquired by the United States throughpurchase or through a 99 year lease.With regard to the agreement suggested in point 2 above,I feel confident that specific details need not be considered at this time and that such questions as the exact locations ofthe land which the United States might desire to purchase or leasecould be readily determined upon subsequently through friendlynegotiations between the two Governments.With regard to your reference to publicity concerning the contingent destination of the British fleet, I should make itclear that I have not haa in mine any public statement by youbut merely an assurance to me along the lines indicated, as forexample reiteration to me of your statement to Parliament on-June hoI should welcome u reply as coon as may be possible.LONDON    August 1^.  19h0.

That wouldtake, he estimates, one month.   Directly legislation is passed the destroyers will be available with all necessary ammunition and spares hut without anti-aircraft guns.   How long will it take you to get crews over toBermuda and Halifax?As regards our contribution to the [? deal], thePresident said that the orooosal for bases and flyinggrounds, in the form proposed by the War Department and agreed by you, was too complicated and restricted to convince Congress that the security of the United states would he increased as a result of the transfer of the destroyers.   Hence the form he now aroposes.   In practice the first step would be for joint consultation between ourselves and the United States Government on the exactfacilities and locations with early work on thepreparation of the aerodromes.   I nope that you can accept these phrases,   that they mean in oraccice, is that theUnited States Government acceot the thesis that the outerline of defences of Pan America is the British fleetbased on Britain, to which they contribute destroyers and later contribute other things and accept the thesis iliatthe inner line is our islands off North America whosedefence will be mainly organized by the United Stateswithout the transfer of sovereignty.   I think in our replyyou might, without making it part of a bargain, press for more flying boats and for rifles.
