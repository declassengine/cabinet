Parliament. 1.   The War Cabinet discussed the question whether the HouseProposed of Commons should go into secret session for the debate on foreignSecret Session affairs to be held the following afternoon,on Foreign The War Cabinet agreed .^Affairs. 0(a) That the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury shouldtake soundings on the proposal that the Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should first make an objective statement on Foreign Affairs (and in particular the Far East) in open session and that this statement should be followed by a debate in secret session.(b) That if this suggestion was generally acceptable, it shouldbe adopted, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsbeing informed as soon as possible.(c) That the Prime Minister should announce the governments intentions as to procedure in reply to a Private notice question, but that the matter should be left to a free vote of the House.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 213thConclusions,Minutes 1, 2and 3.)Balloonbarrage atDover.Attack on theSouth CoastConvoy.(Previous   -reference:W.M. (40) 213thConclusions,Minute 3.)Baiderengaged.2. The War Cabinet were given the latest information inregard to operational matters.The main point of interest was the engagement which hadtaken place the previous afternoon in the Straits of Dover, in which100 enemy aircraft had been engaged by four of our squadrons.During the day the enemy had lost 9 machines for certain. our losses amounted to 2 machines, plus two more damaged. that morning there had been another aerial engagement over Dover,when 4 of our squadrons had engaged the enemy. The latest report was that the enemy had lost 8 machines for certain, 8 more probable,and 6 possible. One of our pilots had been killed, and severalmachines had been damaged.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, the Chief of theAir Staff said that he would examine the desirability of placing aballoon barrage at Dover.The First Lord of the Admiralty referred to the delay which occurred in getting our anti-aircraft defences into action whenenemy aircraft appeared. He undertook to furnish the PrimeMinister with a report on the matter in the course of the day.The First Lord of the Admiralty referred to the attack on theSouth Coast Convoy in the previous week, in which a number ofships had been destroyed. It appeared that the three vessels whichhad been sunk by E-boats had left the convoy without orders, inthe dark.   He was making further enquiry into this matter.On the night of the 28th July, the armed merchant cruiserAlcantara had chased and been in action with an armed raider offRio de Janeiro. The engagement had lasted one hour, during whichthe Alcantara had been holed in the engine-room and her speedreduced to 10 knots. The enemy had last been seen proceedingsouth at 15 knots. Orders had been issued which, it was hoped,would result in her being intercepted by other forces.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Foreign Affairs.Japan.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 206thConclusions,Minute 2.)[21576]3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred totelegrams Nos. 1332 and 1343, of the 27th July, from Tokyo, giving an account of Sir Robert Craigie&apos;s talk with the Japanese Ministerfor Foreign Affairs. The War Cabinet would also have seen thestatement in the Press that the Japanese authorities had arrestedb 2
Poland.Englishmenin Tokyo, one of whom had been Reuter&apos;shad not yet received a report from oursome nineCorrespondent.    HeAmbassador.The Foreign Secretary also reported that the Polish Govern-ment had received news that the Soviet Government would shortlyoccupy the greater part of what was now called the Government-General (telegram No. 330 to Moscow). If this was true, it might mean that an arrangement had been come to between Germany and russia whereby Russia would be given a free hand in Poland,provided that Germany was given a free hand elsewhere.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.U.S.A.Proposed grant to U.S. Armyand Air Forceof facilities incertain british colonies.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 146thConclusions,Minute 14.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 276) proposing that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington should beauthorised to offer to the United States, without asking for anyquid pro quo, certain facilities requested by the United States Armyand Air Force.In discussion.it was argued that it was doubtful whether thefacilities, once granted, could be withdrawn at the end of the war,and that this might prove the thin end of the wedge. The Secretaryof State for the Colonies thought that the grant of these facilitiesmust, in the long run, result in the loss of sovereignty.It was also argued that it might be wise to exercise caution inregard to the grant of facilities to Pan-American Airways, whichhad shown itself in the past to be hostile to British interests.It was generally felt, however, that the position had changedgreatly since the matter had last been discussed. The UnitedStates had supplied us with so much that it was difficult to refusetheir request; and their attitude was increasingly favourable to us.The War Cabinet-(1) Subject to (2), gave general approval to the grant to theUnited States of the following facilities : (a) Facilities for United States military aircraft toland in Jamaica, Georgetown (British Guiana)and Trinidad.(b) A lease to Pan-American Airways, acting as agents of the United States Government, of a smallnear   the  Trinidad  aerodrome  where  certainfacilities would be required,(e) A lease of approximately a square mile for an aerodrome in British Guiana.(d) Permission for Pan-American Airways to constructan aerodrome near Kingston, Jamaica.(e) Authority for the United States Army to sendoccasional training flights to a Newfoundlandairport.(2) invitation ted the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for the Colonies to consider further whether any special conditions should be made in regardto the grant of the proposed facilities to Pan-american airways.France. 5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theAnglo-French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 288) on relationsrelations. with France.  The French Government, in a letter of the 25th July,(Previous had said that they would not receive a British Agent in Francereference: until two incidents had been settled, namely, the dropping of w.M. (40) 213th leaflets in French Morocco and the retention in England of certain conclusions, members of the French Missions in London.   A draft reply was minute 5.) attached for the consideration of the War Cabinet.
\ HiThe baltic states.Attitude toadoptedtowardsSovietabsorption.Y &quot;be. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 287) in regard tothe notes which he had received from the three Baltic Ministersformally repudiating the legality of the proceedings resulting in the incorporation of their countries in the Soviet Union, and expressing the hope that the incorporation would not be recognised by HisMajesty&apos;s Government. It was proposed to reply that HisMajesty&apos;s Government, while expressing no views as to the futureof the Baltic States, considered that the circumstances attending the recent political changes in those States were not such as to causethem to cease treating the Ministers as the accredited representativesof their respective countries.In discussion the following points were made : (i) Sir Stafford Cripps should be asked whether a reply in the sense proposed would be likely to prejudice our chances of bringing about an understanding between Russia and turkey.(ii) It would be imprudent to comply with the Russian demand that the gold of the Baltic State banks deposited withthe Bank of England should be handed over to the SovietState Bank, until we could obtain compensation for the considerable British property and interests in the baltic states.(iii) Our recognition of the Soviet absorption of Estonia, Latviaand Lithuania ought likewise to be deferred until wewere in a position to obtain a quid pro quo.The broad argument in favour of the line proposed was that,while it seemed unlikely that we should be able to establish satis-factory relations with the French Government, it was generally felt that it was desirable to avoid an open break as long as possible.If we delayed sending an answer, the move to establish a BritishAgent at Vichy was likely to be suffocated by events.It was pointed out that we had stopped dropping leaflets in french Morocco, but only for lack of suitable aircraft. The leafletsdropped were reported to have had considerable success, and it was undesirable to abandon the right to drop leaflets.The Prime Minister invited the Secretary of State for Air togive further consideration to the question whether suitable aircraft could not be made available for dropping leaflets in French Morocco.The main consideration was felt to be that to send a letter inthe terms proposed to the Vichy Government might reactunfavourably on General de Gaulle;s cause. Before reaching adecision it would be very desirable that he should be consulted.The War Cabinet (1) Deferred a decision on the proposed communication to theFrench representative in regard to relations with france until General de Gaulle had been consulted.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toinform the Government of Canada that no reason was seen why a representative of the French Governmentshould not continue to be accredited to the canadian government.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to give furtherconsideration to the question whether aircraft could bemade available for dropping leaflets in French Morocco.
The Far East. 7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefs(Previous of Staff on Far Eastern Policy (W.P. (40) 289).   A record of the reference: discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of war.M. (40) 207th Cabinet Conclusions.Conclusions, The War Cabinet :-Minute 14.)(1) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to prepare appreciations of thesituation in the Far East, the general assumption being that Japan commits an act of aggression against theNetherlands East Indies, that the Dutch resist, and thatthis country comes to their assistance. The appreciationsshould indicate our general plan of campaign (a) with,and (o) without, the support of the United States. Theseappreciations should, if time permits, include a reviewof the economic aspects.(2) Agreed that, when this appreciation had been approved, itshould be sent to the Dominion Governments who shouldbe invited to express their views.(3) Agreed, that, while no decision by the War Cabinet as toour action in the contingency contemplated was called for at the present time, it was important, not to give theJapanese any grounds for thinking that we should stand aside, if they interfered with the integrity of theNetherlands East Indies.(4) Agreed that, the Foreign Secretary should approach theNetherlands Minister on the following lines : that wewere considering our action in the contingency contem-plated, but that our capacity to help would dependconsiderably on the attitude of the United States. TheNetherlands Minister should be encouraged to sound theUnited States Government as to what their attitude would be.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 29, 1940.The War Cabinet :-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ask Sir Stafford Crippswhether a reply on the lines proposed at &quot; Y&quot; would prejudice our chances of bringing, about an under-standing between Russia and Turkey.(2) Subject to this enquiry, agreed that a reply should be senton the lines proposed.
