Evacuation of 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the MinisterChildren from of Home Security covering a Memorandum by the ParliamentaryGreat Britain. Under-Secretary of State for the Dominions, on the future of the(Previous Children&apos;s Overseas Reception Scheme (W.P. (G.) (40) 179).Reference: The Home Secretary said that there was general agreementW.M. (40) 195th tliat tlie Governments scheme for sending children to the united conclusions, States and Canada in escorted ships must now be held in abeyance.Minute 1.) rr^e moxe difficult question was whether, in order to avoid any suggestion of class distinction in the matter, if the government scheme were put into abeyance, the grant of exit permits to enablechildren to be sent to the United States or Canada should alsobe suspended.The following points emerged from the discussion : (i) The proposal virtually to ban the sending abroad of anyfurther children by private arrangements was consideredunduly drastic. It would be sufficient if it was statedthat it was hoped parents would not take advantageof the private facilities that existed for sending their children abroad.(ii) Stress was laid on the blow that the decision would beto public opinion in the United States and Canada.Great preparations had been made to receive thechildren (Mrs. Roosevelt had made a personal broadcastappeal), and it would be said that every offer to help from America to this country was turned down. Purther,the presence of our children in American householdswould be useful from a propaganda point of view.(iii) The Secretary of State for the Dominions said that theHigh Commissioner for Canada had informed him thatour decision to abandon the Government scheme on theground that an escort for the ships could not be providedwould cause consternation, shock and disgust in Canada.The Canadian Parliament had gone so far as to passa law giving income tax relief to those who receivedthese children in their households.(iv) The War Cabinet adhered to the view (a) that we couldnot take warships off anti-invasion duties to provide/escorts under the scheme, (b) that shiploads of childrencould not be sent across the Atlantic unescorted, underthe Government scheme.(v) The Lord President of the Council suggested that so faras the Government&apos;s scheme was concerned, it shouldbe stated that the sending of large numbers of children in special ships was not now possible, as escorts couldnot be provided. With regard to sending childrenprivately, although the risks of the voyage should be emphasised, no absolute veto should be placed on theirgoing. To overcome the difficulty of class distinctionit should be announced that there would be a limited amount of accommodation for children to go to north america both 3rd class as well as 1st. In order to assistthe children of poorer parents, advantage should betaken of the offers of various philanthropic organisa-tions which were prepared to help in this matter.(vi) It was suggested that, when the United States were informed that it was not possible to provide escorts forthese ships, they might offer to convoy the shipsthemselves, or perhaps send over a special passengership to take the children, as they had done in the caseof Americans in this country who desired to return tothe States.[21524] b 2&quot;A&quot;
(vii) The passage in the draft reply suggesting that thesituation had greatly deteriorated in the past three weeksshould be omitted.The War Cabinet: (a) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Departments concerned, to prepare a revised draft announcement on the lines of &quot; A &quot; above.(&amp;) Agreed that an opportunity should be afforded to the HighCommissioner for Canada to see the announcement before it was made public.Home Defence. 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the function of       Secretary of State for War (W.P. (G.) (40) 177) relating to thethe civil leaflet &quot;If the Invader Comes.&quot;fprevfouT The Chief 0f the ImPerial General Staff said that the leafletReference-        gave general rules only.   Since it had been issued, the War OfficeW M (40) 164th had nacl many enquiries how the rules should be carried out.  BeforeConclusions       giying tne public guidance, it was essential to decide whetherMinute 12)&apos;      defence arrangements should include active resistance by the civil1 mu      &apos;       population, or whether the plans made should rely solely on theuse of the military and Local Defence Volunteers.  The Commander -in-Chief, Home Forces, was of the opinion that actual fightingshould be restricted to the military and Local Defence volunteers and that no civilian who was not a member of these forces, shouldbe authorised to use lethal weapons.The following points were made in discussion : (a) Unless the armed bodies formed for the defence of factories and such-like places were enrolled in the Local defence volunteers, it would be impossible for the military commander to know what places were held or whatforces were available.   Such knowledge was essential.(b) Armed civilians acting independently might well upset the plans of a Military Commander by their unexpectedand unorganised activities.(c) The Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Home Security suggested that instructionsmight be drafted on the lines of those already issued to the Police, who had been informed that, until theenemy had obtained effective control of an area, it was their duty to fight and to treat the enemy as miscreants.Should the Police, however, find themselves behind enemylines, they had orders to give up their arms and to look.after the interests of the civil population.(d) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggestedthat the position was that, if civilians used arms, theenemy would be entitled to treat all civilians as francs-francs-tireurs. On the other hand it was suggested that, inview of the action already taken by the enemy in machinegunning refugees, this threat need not be regarded very ,, ?jseriously. &apos;tj(e) A suggestion was made that the Local Defence Volunteersmight be divided into two classes, the first classcomprising those who would help in the defence of factories, &amp;c, and the second class those who would usearms only in defence of their homes.(/) The position of women was mentioned. It was urged thatthose who wished to do so should be provided withuniforms and allowed to use arms.
The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the personnel of organisations formed for thedefence of factories, &amp;c, should be enrolled in the local defence Volunteers.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War, the Home secretary and the Minister of Information in consultation, toprepare and submit to the War Cabinet, a revised draft statement for issue to the public, in the light of thediscussion which had taken place as to the use of lethalweapons by &quot;civilians.&quot; In this connection considera-tion should be given to the formation of two classes ofLocal Defence Volunteers and to the position of women.3.   The War Cabinet had before them : A Memorandum by the Home Secretary, covering a draftBill (H.P.C. (40) 214).Draft Minutes of the 26th Meeting of the Home PolicyCommittee.In discussion the following points were made : (1) The machinery proposed to be established under the draftBill was civil, not military, in character. It would,however, only operate in parts of the country, and during periods in which it was impossible for the ordinaryprocesses of criminal justice to take place.(2) The Bill should be introduced, read a first time and published that day, and the remaining stages taken thefollowing week.(3) The Lord Chancellor said that he was taking steps to choose the men whom he would appoint as- chairmen of theSpecial Courts in the various districts, if the need arose.(4) The Home Secretary said that further consideration hadbeen given, since the meeting of the Home PolicyCommittee, to the composition and functions of theSpecial Courts. It was no longer certain that the finalrecommendation would be that the chairman of a SpecialCourt should sit with two Justices of the Peace. Itwas proposed to consult with some of the judges on thispoint.(5) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that thearrangements proposed would be entirely satisfactory to the War Office.The War Cabinet-(i) Approved the draft Emergency Powers (Defence) (No. 2)Bill in the form attached to Paper H.P.C. (40) 214,subject to the amendment recommended by the home policy Committee, and to any drafting or other minor amendments that might be found necessary or desirable.(ii) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the introductionof the Bill in the House of Commons, with a view to its passage into law at an early date.
The Far East.J apanesedemand forclosing the burma Boad.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 195thConclusions,Minute 9.),x.,4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams : Tokyo telegram No. 1196, Sir Robert Craigie said thatthere was a real danger of Japan joining the Axis Powers.Any remedy put forward must be immediate to be effective. Inthe Ambassadors opinion, the best solution would be asfollows : Agreement on our part to suspend transit of warmaterial through Burma for a period of three months (i.e.during the rainy season) on the understanding that duringthis time special efforts will be made to bring about a&quot;just and equitable peace&quot; in the Far East. Shouldthese efforts fail, His Majesty&apos;s Government to remain free to permit transit trade to be resumed at the end of thethree months period.Tokyo telegram No. 1203, containing the text of a letterfrom Mr. Arita, dated the 9th July. In this letter Mr. Aritastated that the latest offer which we had put forward was unacceptable. The Japanese Government intended to insist onthe closing of the Burma road, and further delay might havedeplorable effects on Anglo-Japanese relations.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that atelegram had been received from Mr. Menzies, taking the view thatthe danger in the Far East would be increased rather thandiminished by any non-realistic approach to Japan. Mr. Brucehad suggested a settlement on broad lines, which would includefinancial and economic assistance to Japan, and also the cession to japan of certain islands.In discussion, the following points were made :  (1) We were running a grave risk of being involved in warwith Japan, since the military element in that country might take matters into their own hands at any moment.The Japanese would be unlikely to become more accom-accommodating as the days went by. An early decision wastherefore necessary.(2) We were unlikely to be able to obtain better terms thanthe solution recommended by Sir Robert Craigie. Theperiod for which the Burma road would be closed underthis solution was the rainy season.(3) If, however, the Burma road were closed, it was not likelyto be re-opened unless and until we were in a strongmilitary position.The Foreign Secretary said that he would like an opportunityof further examining the position, in the light of the view generally accepted by the War Cabinet that we should endorse the solutionproposed by Sir Robert Craigie at &quot;X &quot; above. Subject to such further examination, he would telegraph to Sir Robert Craigieinstructing him to negotiate a settlement on the lines suggested.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to proceed as proposed.
foreign information.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet the following information : Spain.(PreviousReferenceConclusions,Minute 8.)Germany: plans and intentions.Sir Samuel Hoare had had a conversation with the SpanishMinister of Foreign Affairs (telegram No. 497 from Madrid). Thelatter had indicated that, later on, Franco might play the role of w.M. (40) 195th an intermediary between the belligerents. Sir Samuel had repliedthat if Franco was to play such a role he must not take any actionwhich would make it impossible for him to claim to occupy an impartial position.Telegrams had been received from Athens (Nos. 527 and 528)purporting to give details of Germany&apos;s preparations for invasion of this country; e.g., that 16,000 small craft were being assembledat various ports in France and Norway, and that Germany had31,000 aircraft, but only 10,000 pilots.A telegram had been received from our Minister in Switzerland(No. 365) giving an account of a conversation which a traveller,recently returned from a visit to Berlin, had had with variouspersonages in Germany.The War Cabinet agreed with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s viewthat no reply should be sent to this telegram.naval operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 198thConclusions,Minute 2.)Engagementsin theMediterranean.Attacks on shipping.Munitionssupplies fromthe UnitedStates ofAmerica,(previous reference:W.M. (40) 172ndConclusions,Minute 11.)6. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War Cabinetinformation in regard to the short action between British andItalian forces in the Mediterranean on the previous day. ItalianNaval forces had been sighted eighty miles East of Cape Spartivento.The Commander-in-Chief had engaged the enemy, and H.M.S.Warspite had obtained a hit at extreme range. The enemy had turned quickly away, under cover of smoke, and made for Messina.It had been reported that a damaged enemy cruiser had been into about seventy miles from Messina at 7 p.m. the previous evening.Force &quot; H &quot; had been bombed at intervals on the previous day by aircraft. Two enemy aircraft had been shot down by gunfire,and two by fighters, while seven others had been, damaged.Four of our convoys on the East Coast had been unsuccessfully attacked by aircraft on the previous day. It was believed that several of the enemy aircraft had been shot down.A convoy with nearly 250,000 rifles and over 300 field guns had reached our ports and was now being unloaded.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 10, 1940.

Decypher. Mr. KPlly,     (Berne).8th July, 1940.D. - 1-35 a.m. 9th July, 1940,Ra      7,25 a,m.        9th July, 1940.No.. 365.  -- , .IMPORTANT.Secret end Confidential.&apos; , -rM. Paravicini asked me today to meet Dr. Carl Burckhardt,Acting President of the Red Cross,, who has just returned, froma visit to Berlin on mission regarding Red Cr*oss relief forrefugees in France.      Baron Weiszacker had sent aeroplane for him and he stayed three days.2..   After &quot;begging me to treat his communication with theutmost discretion Dr. Burckhardt said he was given opportunityfor long individual conversations with R.(Gauleite,rs, one Generaland Wei slacker himself.      All four told the same story.3.    Hitler had returned to his old.idea and. hesitated - ,before attacking England because he still clung to the hope ofworking arrangement with the British Empire as hinted at inhis recent interview in Belgium with the American journalistCarl von Wiegand.      He wanted a European Federation and fe^tthis wou-ld be&quot; difficult without British co-operation.     Therewere some &quot;local demands&quot; of Italy which he was bound tq jsupport but in geseral he wanted &quot;a white peace like Sadowa&quot;(two of the talkers used this formula). f . The General said    r   f that while they were confident of their ability to defeat   ;:England they realised that it might involve -much greatersacrifices than had the defeat of the French army, most ofwhom had put up a very poor show and fought half-heartedly,4.    Each of the four had insisted that he was expressinghis personal opinion but one of them had asked Doctor Burckhardtwhether there was any chance of his having Red Cross business in England when he might see if there was any hope of a&quot;reasonable arrangement.&quot;     Doctor Burckhardt said he couldnot do so but would tal^to an English friend in Switzerland.5.    The Doctor assured me that (a) his Red Cross mission was very important and not a cover for these conversations and (b) German Government really were hesitating with the preparations for an attack on England and they were willing tocall it off if they could do so without the loss of face.6.    He said that he.felt sure that this was not due toweakness hut to a faint hope of avoiding further sacrificesinvolved although he also said that he had watched Hitler&apos;striumphal entry into Berlin and felt that there was nospontaneous entusiasm.
7.      I told Dr. Burckhardt (as I already had on theprevious occasion), that I thought that our distrust of hitler, apart&quot; from anything else, was a fatal obstacle toany peace.     He said that he fully appreciated this hut had thought it his duty to Switzerland to inform me of his conversations.      He had hesitated about telling me &quot;because it would be most disastrous for him personally if any ofthis obtained any sort of publicity.      Whatever we might think he begged that his report should be treated asabsolutely secret.8.      It is very important for our own position here that his wish should be respected as he is most influentialhere and if he were made to look foolish, my own positionand reputation for discretion would be compromised.      Thesituation is difficult enough.9.   &apos; tV. Burckhardt mentioned casually that he would have to&apos;return to Berlin shortly about the refugee problem.10.    Presumably we shall have no thought of compromisingoa any such lines but if it is important for us to gaintime I venture to suggest that it might be better to leaveme Without instructions rather than to return a flat negative.If then Dr.  Burckhardt should again approach me beforereturning to Berlin it will show us that- he [Was&apos; really being-sounded while the Germans will be left guessing as&quot; towhether His Majesty&apos;s Government are taking their talkseriously or not.      So long as secrecy is maintained completesilence on our part can. in nc/fray weaken our war effortwhile it may weaken that of the enemy by causing hesitation.
