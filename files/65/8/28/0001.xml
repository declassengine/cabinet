Foreign Affairs.german intentions.France:M. Daladier.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 212thConclusions,Minute 3.)internal situation.1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet the following information : In a telegram of the 16th July our Ambassador at Angora had reported that the German Military Attache had stated that the invasion of Great Britain had been postponed until the first week in August, and that he intended to go to Germany to follow events.On the 27th July our Ambassador reported that the german military Attache had left Istanbul on the previous day, ostensiblyfor Belgrade (telegrams Nos. 796 and 862 from Angora).M. Daladier had now abandoned the endeavour to leaveCasablanca, and intended to return to France (telegram No. 193from Tangier).Spain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 205thConclusions,Minute 3.)The iberian peninsula.U.S.S.R.,Turkey and theStraits.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 213thConclusions,Minute 4.)A report from Geneva, (telegram No. 90) suggested that relations between M. Laval and General Weygand were verystrained and might at any time lead to the downfall of the PetainGovernment.The Foreign Secretary reported that he had had a very interesting discussion with Mr. Eccles, who had known marshal petain very well. Mr. Eccles thought that the dominant motive inMarshal Petain&apos;s mind was that France should return to theConstitution and outlook which had inspired the country beforethe Third Republic, and that his desire to alter the Constitutionof France had probably blinded him to the dangers of trustingGermany&apos;s word.Mr. Eccles had reported that the Spaniards were anxious tokeep out of the war, and that their attitude towards this country was far better than might have been expected a month ago.The Foreign Secretary said that he had seen the PortugueseAmbassador the previous day. The Spanish-Portuguese Protocolwas a move in the right direction.A long telegram had now been received from Sir S. Crippsabout negotiations between the U.S.S.R. and Turkey (telegramNo. 529 from Moscow). Sir S. Cripps&apos;s conclusion was on much the same lines as the provisional War Cabinet view. Subject tothe comments of our Ambassador in Angora on this telegram, weshould be in a position to give Sir S. Cripps instructions as to thelines of the approach which he should make in Moscow.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Japan.Arrest ofBritish subjects.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 215thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that atelegram had now been sent to Sir Robert Craigie (No. 769 toTokyo) putting to him the suggestion that, as a measure of reprisal,10 or 12 Japanese subjects should be seized, here or in the far east. This telegram had crossed telegram No. 1384 fromSir Robert Craigie suggesting measures which we should be readyto adopt at short notice. We must await Sir Robert Craigie&apos;reply to the telegram sent to him before deciding what action totake. But in the meantime, the Departments concerned wishedto take administrative steps to ensure that the Japanese subjectswhom we should arrest, if retaliatory measures were to be decided upon, should not leave British territory. He (the foreign secretary) had agreed that such measures might be taken, providedthat no overt step was taken.A statement had been published in Tokyo that Sir robert craigie&apos;s visit to the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs had
f 0dealt with the general situation and had had very little to do withthe question of the arrest of British subjects. This was quiteuntrue and somewhat ominous.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Aliens.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 215thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Lord Privy Seal suggested that the AdvisoryCommittee on Aliens should include someone from the T.U.C.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was invited to askSir W. Citrine whether he would be willing to serve on theAdvisory Committee himself, or, failing that, would suggest two orthree names.Reference was also made to a number of Dutchmen who hadbeen interned as aliens and kept in prison. Strong representations on these cases had been made by the Netherlands Minister.The Foreign Secretary said that he was disturbed about theposition. No real progress could be made so long as we continued todeal with individual cases. He had proposed to the Home secretary that representatives of his Department should meet the NetherlandsMinister and Minister of Justice in order to deal with the matter on a more comprehensive basis. He undertook to report to the WarCabinet on the matter on the following day.The Lord Privy Seal thought that consideration should begiven to the establishment of panels of responsible persons of thedifferent nationalities concerned, who could advise the HomeSecretary as to the reliability of aliens of their nationality now inthis country.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.MilitaryOperations.Middle East.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 213thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Secretary of State for War gave the War Cabinet thelatest information as regards the position on the Libyan frontier.Particulars of the discussion are recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,July 31, 1940.
