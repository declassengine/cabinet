Evacuation ofChildren from great Britain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 189thConclusions,Minute 7.)1. The Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister of Home Security said that the sinking of the ArandoraStar had raised the question whether ships carrying children to north America under the Government scheme should be escorted.When the scheme had first been started, it had been thought thatthe children could go in unescorted ships, but it had been emphasised that parents, before deciding to send their children to the States,must choose between the risks involved in the sea voyage and the risks of remaining in this country.In discussion it was generally agreed that in present circum-stances it was impossible to allow children to be sent overseas underthe Government scheme in unescorted ships. A number of children,sent overseas under private arrangements, would no doubt be sailingin unescorted ships, and there was no reason to interfere with this.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that in present cireum-stances it was impossible to provide more than a token escort forthese ships without seriously interfering with our anti-invasionarrangements.The War Cabinet decided (a) That children should not be sent to North America underthe Government scheme in unescorted ships. If, at alater date, it was found practicable to provide escorts,this should be done; but in the meantime the scheme should be held in abeyance.(b) That the public announcement in regard to (a) above should merely state that, owing to the shipping situation at thepresent time, the operation of the scheme must be delayed.(c) That the Canadian Government should be informed confi-dentially of the reasons for the postponement of thescheme.(d) That the First Lord of the Admiralty and Minister ofShipping should consider whether children could be sent overseas in slower ships, which could sail in the normalconvoys,The North Sea. 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the sinking at sight First Lord of the Admiralty containing draft instructions for of unidentified aircraft and submarines in regard to shipping in Home Watersvessels. (W.P. (40) 202, Revise).   The area in which aircraft might attack(Previous a^ S^S^ was smaller than the submarine area.reference: The War Cabinet W.M. (40) 193rd Approved the draft instructions, subject to further con-Conclusions, sideration by the Air Staff and the Naval Staff as toMmute 7.) whether the area in which aircraft might attack at sightcould safely be extended.France.The french fleet andFrench aircraft.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 194thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The War Cabinet were given the latest information inregard to the French Fleet, and as to action taken by French aircraft at Gibraltar.The discussion and the Conclusions reached are recorded inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.[21511]b 2
The air situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 194thConclusions,Minute 9.)bomber command.Enemy activity.Middle East.General.4. The Chief of the Air Staff said that successful bombing operations had been carried out on the night of the 4th/5th Julyon dockyards at Wilhelmshaven and Emden, and on various aero-dromes.Fires had been started at Kiel, and a direct hit obtained onthe Dortmund-Ems Canal.On the 5th July, daylight raids had been carried out, mainly on targets in Holland.   Two of our aircraft had not returned.On the night of the 5th/6th July, attacks had been carried out against the ruhr and North-West German ports, and mines hadbeen laid in the Elbe estuary. All but one of the 63 aircraftengaged had returned.Cloud conditions had enabled the enemy to carry out a numberof attacks in daylight on this country during the previous day, but little damage had been effected.At night there had been a reduction in enemy activity, possiblyowing to weather conditions.Two enemy aircraft had been shot down by our fighters earlythat morning, and two enemy fighters had been shot down theprevious day by a fighter patrol over France.Reconnaissances had been carried out on the Norwegian coast.In the Middle East, 9 Italian aircraft for certain, and possibly2 others, had been shot down, one of our fighters having crashedin the combat.The Chief of the Air Staff gave the following information inreply to questions. He thought that our bombers had done con-siderable damage to Hamburg, though the accounts appearing incertain telegrams from abroad as to the extent of the destructionwere probably exaggerated.It was impossible to say quite how much damage had beendone to the Scharnhorst, but she was almost certainly out of action for a very considerable time.The movement of German troop-transport planes, recorded invarious reports, might well be accounted for by these planes being used for the transport of personnel and stores, owing to the unsatis-factory state of land communications.The report in telegram No. 350 from Berne that a high propor-tion of our bombs failed to explode, was probably true. While, onthe whole, our bombs had been very satisfactory, there had been some difficulty with one type of incendiary bomb.The German Air Force was being deployed for attack on thiscountry. The existence of dive-bombers on the North coast ofFrance probably portended an attack on our shipping.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Air Raid 5.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a complaintWarnings. had been received from Portsmouth that five red warnings had been(Previous issued in the previous 24 hours thereby greatly slowing-down pro-Reference: duction. The Naval authorities at Portsmouth were anxious toW.M. (40) 191st introduce a system whereby no. warning should be given in theConclusions, Portsmouth district until the Admiral-in-charge of the DockyardMinute 6.)        gave instructions that work should cease in the Dockyard and the workpeople take refuge.It was pointed out that such an arrangement would cut acrossthe modification of the warning system which had been agreed uponat the meeting referred to in the margin.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Home Security to enquire into theposition at Portsmouth, and to take steps to ensure thatthe agreed modifications in the warning system were giveneffect to without delay.
France.Members ofFrench civil and MilitaryMissions inLondon.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 191stConclusions,Minute 13.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theCommittee presided over by Sir Robert Vansittart had recommendedthat steps should at once be taken to segregate all officers of theFrench Naval, Military and Air Missions and officials withequivalent rank of the Anglo-French Co-ordinating Committee, theFrench Armaments Mission, the French Civil Air Mission, theFrench Oil Mission and the French Economic Warfare Mission.The only exceptions to this decision were to be officers and officials who had already offered their services to General de Gaulle or tothe British Government or were now prepared to join General de gaulle. The others were to be invited to leave London and to reside in accommodation which had been made available for the purposeat Oxford.The Foreign Secretary understood that the First Lord of theAdmiralty saw some objection to this course and thought thatcertain members at any rate of the French Naval Mission shouldnot be segregated for the time being. The matter had been mentioned to the Prime Minister, but he had not had time to consider fully the Admiralty objection.In discussion, it was felt that the reasons given by theAdmiralty against segregating certain members of the French NavalMission at the present juncture were strong. Was it possible toproceed with the segregation of other officers and officials proposedwhile leaving the members of the French Naval Mission alone ? Itwas generally felt that the measure of discrimination involved would be very difficult to justify, and might well nullify the reasonson account of which the Admiralty wished to leave the officers ofthe French Naval Mission at large.On the other hand, the War Cabinet were informed that it was known that a number of the officers and officials of these Missionsgenerally were acting contrary to our interests and were using their influence to prevent French officers and French personnel from joining General de Gaulle. It was suggested that it would be useful if the evidence of this, in regard to officers of the french naval Mission, could be communicated to the First Sea Lord.The Lord President of the Council suggested that one plan would be not to segregate any of the officers or officials concernedimmediately, but to give them a definite warning that, while wewere not anxious to put restrictions on their liberty, we should haveto do so if they conducted themselves in a way which was contraryto our interests.The War Cabinet were informed that there was reason tobelieve that the Vansittart Committee would take the view thatstronger action was necessary; and that many of the French officers concerned would welcome action on the lines proposed by theCommittee.The War Cabinet Decided to postpone a decision on this matter for 24 hours.France.Repatriation ofFrenchwounded.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 185thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded theWar Cabinet that he had been authorised to suggest to the FrenchGovernment that the French wounded who were fit to travel shouldbe sent direct to ports in France, provided that a guarantee couldbe obtained from the Germans that the ship carrying them wouldbe allowed to return safely to this country. The French Govern-ment had been so informed.On the 4th July, M. Cambon had complained that the Frenchconvalescents at the White City were being given the choice of joining General de Gaulle or being repatriated. M. Cambon main-tained that the offer of this choice was inconsistent with our offer to send these men back to France.
The War Cabinet decided as follows :  (1) We adhered to our undertaking that all French woundedshould be returned to France; but that this undertakingmust be subject to the proviso that we should not sendback to France anyone who expressed a desire to stay in this country.(2) Discretion should be used in the means taken to ascertainwhich of the French wounded did not wish to return toFrance.Spain.Admission of armed Germans.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 193rdConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 480 from Madrid. Sir Samuel Hoare was, hethought, dealing as successfully as could be hoped for with the difficult problem of preventing the admission to Spain of armedGermans.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Far East.Japanesedemand forclosing the burma Road.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 194thConclusions,Minute 1.)9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the WarCabinet draft telegrams to Sir Robert Craigie, prepared inaccordance with the decision of the War Cabinet the previous day.He had shown these drafts to the Prime Minister, who had approved them.The Lord President of the Council drew attention to telegramNo. 558 from Sir Clark Kerr, suggesting that our best course mightwell be to attempt to obtain a general settlement in the Far East.The Foreign Secretary said that, of course, it was very doubtfulwhether Chiang Kai-shek would agree to the terms of any settle-ment which was likely to be offered.The War Cabinet Approved the despatch of the draft telegrams preparedby the Foreign Secretary.U.S.S.R. 10.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the ForeignManufacture of Secretary had been anxious that the manufacture of certainDestroyer Destroyer turbines by a firm in this country for the U.S.S.R. shouldturbines in this be completed at an early date, in order that certain Soviet personnelcountry. should leave this country.   It had originally been hoped that theturbines would be shipped on the 20th July. The Soviet trade delegation, however, were now making certain further demands asto work which they wanted done on these turbines, and it looked as though it would not be possible to ship the turbines until, say,two or three weeks after that date.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a delay to this extent was not, he thought, material.The War Cabinet-Agreed that this matter should be determined by theAdmiralty and the Foreign Office in consultation.
Eire.defence negotiations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 191stConclusions,Minute 11.)11. The Lord President of the Council said that he had circulated a copy of the reply received from Mr. de Valera to the communications made to him on the 26th and the 29th June(W.P. (40) 251). -This reply was a flat refusal. He proposed toinform Lord Craigavon that the negotiations had come to an end.The War Cabinet Took note of this statement, and authorised the lord president of the Council to inform Lord Craigavon thatthe negotiations with the Eire Government were now atan end.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 6, 1940.
