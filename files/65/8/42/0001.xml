There had also been a limited numberof attacks on targets in Germany.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theevacuation of our forces in British Somaliland had been completedwith little loss, with the exception of small outlying details.Demolition parties from Ff.M.A.S. Hobart were, however, operating on shore and hoped to embark the remaining troops and equipment.The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff said that the Armed merchant cruiser, Circassia, had been attacked by a submarine 150 miles north-east of the Azores on the evening of the previous day, and hadlater reported that the submarine had broken surface 40 minutesafter having been attacked with depth charges, the conning towerremaining in view for a few minutes before disappearing, sternfirst. If, as it appeared, this attack had been successful it wouldbe the first time that a ship of this size had succeeded in sinking a submarine.Reference was made to the continued heavy shipping losses inthe North-western approaches.The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff said that, in present conditions,escorts were required to accompany convoj^s to a point considerablyfurther west than had previously been the case. Great difficulty was experienced in providing adequate escorts, and the position could not materially improve until our destroyer position had been strengthened.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Switzerland.Violation of swiss neutralityby british aircraft.(previous reference:W.M.

Reference was made to a complaint made by United StatesPress Correspondents that messages to America relating to the air fighting over this country on Friday last had been held up for ninehours, with the result that the German account had got a start ofmany hours of our own.The War Cabinet -Agreed that, although the figures of detailed lossesrequired careful checking and could not be issued at short notice, an interim statement should be issued indicating thegeneral position: and invited the Ministers concerned toconsider whether the present rule against publication ofthe exact hour when raid warnings were given should be modified.Home Defence. 6.

hi9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theParliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Shipping (W.P. (G.)(40) 218), recommending that coasting and short- sea liners shouldbe brought under full requisition on suitable terms. This step wasnecessary to keep the vessels in commission, to give his Departmentcomplete control of them and to deal equally between one owner andanother.The Chamcelior of the Exchequer said that he agreed to thisproposal, subject to the Treasury being kept informed of theMinistry of Shipping&apos;s plans. He thought that, in presentconditions, these small liners should as far as possible be routedcoastwise.The War Cabinet gave a general approval to the proposals in W.P. (G.) (40) 218.of 8. The Prime Minister read a telegram from Mr. mackenzie king giving an account of a discussion he had had with president roosevelt and Mr. Stimson. The main points in the discussion hadbeen as follows : (i) President Roosevelt hoped to begin to supply us withdestroyers before the end of the present week, and asked us to send over skeleton crews to take the destroyersacross the Atlantic.(ii) He hoped to let us have 50 destroyers in all. He hopedalso to let us have 20 motor torpedo boats, 10 large flying boats, a further 250,000 rifles and 150-200 aircraftsupplied with engines which were on order for Sweden.(iii) The United States and Canada were setting up apermanent Joint Board on Defence.(iv) The President would take up with the Government of thiscountry matters pertaining to Newfoundland, on whichthere would have to be co-operation between the three governments United Kingdom, Canada and the UnitedStates.(v) It was not the intention of the Canadian Government eitherto sell or to lease land to the United States Government.They might, however, arrange to permit the UnitedStates Army to enter some parts of Nova Scotia and NewBrunswick in return for permission to the Canadianforces to hold manoeuvres in Maine.(vi) The President would be quite satisfied if the PrimeMinister would make a public statement about theBritish Fleet, similar to his statement to Parliament ofthe 4th June. This would afford the assurance of whichthe President felt in need.The Prime Minister said that he would deal with the last pointin his speech on the following day.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that men had alreadybeen earmarked to act as skeleton crews to bring the Americandestroyers over the Atlantic. The Admiralty&apos;s present intention was that half of the American destroyers should go direct into corn-mission while the remainder were fitted with asdics.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that it wasnot now necessary to pursue the suggestion that Mr. de Valera&apos;shelp should be enlisted with a view to our obtaining destroyers fromthe United States.The War Cabinet (a) Took note with satisfaction of the message from president roosevelt contained in Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s telegram.(b) Invited the Service and Supply Ministers to take action at once to avail themselves of President Roosevelt&apos;s offer.

(40) 216).GoverimJnt^f6 ^^ie Par^ameniary Secretary to the Ministry of Shippingovemmen   o   asj-e(j for approval in principle to the proposal that shipowners whot^TlTlLToi! nac^ lost their ships by war or marine risks, and had not themselvesplaced an order for replacement, should be given an opportunity topurchase new Government-built ships in replacement.In discussion the view was expressed that this step involvedpolitical difficulties. It was suggested that these might perhaps be overcome by retaining under public ownership until the end ofthe war all the vessels which were being built on account of theMinistry of Shipping, while leasing a number of them to privateenterprise.The War Cabinet-Adjourned further discussion on the proposals in W.P.(G.) (40) 216 until the Minister of Shipping could be present. ire.trade negotiations(PreviousEeferenceW.M. (40)conclusions minute 2.)11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (G.) (40) 220) inwhich he summarised the advantages which the United kingdom would derive from the proposed agreement with Eire. The mostimportant of these advantages was the use of Eire ports for the920th transhipment of goods from deep sea ships to smaller ships, detailsof which were set out in a Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping(W.P. (G.) -(40) 213).In discussion it was pointed out that when these negotiations were started, in April, the Eire representatives said that they required another  500,000 a year in order to keep theiragriculturists going. Since then, as a result of the increase in theprice paid by the Ministry of Food for fat cattle in the home market,Eire producers of store cattle would automatically benefit by a Assuming excess of this figure.The Secretary of State for Dominion A fairs said that he hopedthat the proposed agreement (which was dependent on the financialconcession of  500,000 a year) would be carried through, although he did not think that anything catastrophic would happen if theagreement was not made. Opinion in Ireland had improved con-siderably in the last ten days, probably as a result of our airsuccesses.The Prime Minister said that he still felt objection to the course proposed. But we were considerably committed by the negotiations with had taken place. On the whole, he thought that the agree-ment should be concluded, provided that we obtained our own requirements in the negotiations, particularly those in regard to shipping.The War Cabinet Authorised the Ministers concerned to conclude a com-prehensive agreement with Eire on trade matters, on thebasis outlined by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs in his Memoranda W.P. (G.) (40) 204 and 220,subject to the following points  (ft) The payment to be made by the United Kingdom inrespect of fat cattle imported from Eire should beso arranged as to ensure that we paid no more than 500,000 a year, even if cattle prices in this countryrose or the number of cattle imported from Eireincreased.
git(b) This payment should be for 12 months only, subject to review thereafter :(c) This payment should be conditional on our obtainingsatisfaction in regard to our own requirements, inparticular those for shipping facilities indicated by the Minister of Shipping in his memorandum .P. (G.) (40) 213.Food Situation.(previous references:W.M. (40) 23rdConclusions,Minute 1,and 40thConclusions,Minute 1.)12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Pood outlining the policv which he thought should beadopted by his Ministry (W.P. (G) (40) 214), together with aMemorandum bv the Chancellor of the Exchequer commentingthereon (W.P. (G.) (40) 215).The Lord Privy Seal said that the matter had been discussedinformally at a Meeting of Ministers held that morning. TheChancellor of the Exchequer was now prepared to accept theMinisters Memorandum, subject to certain amendments.The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries drew attention to paragraph (vi) of the Minister of Food&apos;s Note, which referred tothe recommendation of the Scientific Committee that, so far aspracticable, the foods comprised in the basal diet should be madeavailable. He asked for an assurance that this paragraph was not inconsistent with the policy which he had announced on the29th June, namely, the greatest possible increase of production fromthe soil, and, within that general objective, the maximum increaseof particular food-stuffs which the scientists had recommended.The Minister of Food- said that there was nothing in his paper which was inconsistent with this announcement.The War Cabinet Approved the Memorandum by the Minister of Food,subject to the following amendments : Paragraph (ii) : add at the end, &quot; As far as can beseen, this will only involve an increase in consumption oftea, sugar, fats and meat &quot; :Paragraph (iii) : insert after &quot; Minister ofSupply&quot;: &quot;storage capacity and the dollar exchange position.&quot;Paragraph (iv) should be amended to read asfollows : &apos;&apos; That the prices of essential food should be keptdown by subsidy, in order to secure cheap food, to restrain a rise in the cost-of-living index figure and toprevent wages rising. The relative pressure on theTreasury from expenditure on food subsidies and fromdemands for increased wages and allowances shall bethe subject of constant review.&quot;Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,August 19, 1940.
