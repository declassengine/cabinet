(40) 216thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Chief of the Air Staff said that there was nothing ofimportance to report in regard to air operations.The Prime Minister referred to a report that German aircraft were being fitted with an improved bomb sight, and invited theChief of the Air Staff to examine the possibility of carrying out a certain operation.The Prime Minister said he was glad that the supply of fighter aircraft was now much more satisfactory. He understood that inthe near future the figures would show a still greater improvement.The Secretary of State for A ir said that the position in regardto the supply of pilots, though improving, was still not altogethersatisfactory. He proposed in the immediate future to submit twoPapers to the War Cabinet on the question.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that a strongItalian force had now moved to the south of Moyale. We had madethe necessary counter-dispositions.The War Cabinet discussed the latest information as regardsthe position on the Libyan frontier.The First Sea Lord said that nothing had been heard ofH.M. submarine Narwhal, which had left the Humber on the22nd July to lay mines off the coast of Norway, and she must therefore be regarded as lost.The Polish ship Kroman had arrived at Freetown on the30th July, having broken out of Dakar on the 27th July. the captain had confirmed that the Richelieu had been hit by twotorpedoes, in addition to the damage to her stern during the attackon the 8th July.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave theCabinet the following information : -In a telegram dated the 31st July (No. 543) Sir stafford cripps had referred to the great difficulty he was experiencingin obtaining an interview with M. Molotoff,&apos; and had suggestedthat he (the Foreign Secretary) should see M. Maisky andindicate to him that it was hardly necessary to maintain an ambassador to a Government whose Minister for ForeignAffairs declined to receive him.The Foreign Secretary said that, whilst he was perfectly willingto see M. Maisky, he did not feel inclined to go so far as to threatenwithdrawal, nor yet to adopt the suggestion in the third paragraphof the Ambassadors telegram.The War Cabinet agreed with the Foreign Secretary&apos;view.
United States ofAmerica.Reported ban onpetrol exports.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to theannouncement in the Press that morning that the United States ofAmerica had declared a complete ban on the export of aviationpetrol to any country outside North and South America. It wasnot clear how this would affect supplies to this country. e.g., by themethod of supplying oil to Canada for re-export to this country.The danger of the action taken by the United States was that itmight provoke the Japanese to seize the Netherland East Indies.Until precise information had been obtained, no action was called for.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Japan. 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the arrest of British Japanese had arrested fourteen British subjects in Japan and twosubjects. *n Korea.  Of the fourteen arrested in Japan, one had died and six(Previous had been released.  Of these six, five had had their papers retained,Reference: &apos;an^ olle bad been informed that he might be called up for furtherW.M. (40) 216th examination. Sir Robert Craigie had now stated that he favouredConclusions ^he arrest of Japanese subjects in British territory as a reprisal,Minute 2.) &apos; and considered that, though the Japanese might reply by furtherreprisals, they would not regard our action as a casus belli (telegramNo. 1409 from Tokyo).   This coincided with his own view.Sir Robert did not favour the arrest of anyone against whom we could not make a case. The Foreign Secretary said he was informed that most of the people whom we had grounds forarresting did not occupy important positions.The Foreign Secretary added that he had discussed the matter on the previous day with the High Commissioners of Australiaand New Zealand, who considered that we should make thesearrests. If the War Cabinet agreed that certain Japanese subjectsshould be arrested, he thought no previous warning should begiven to the Japanese Government. There was, however, thealternative policy of telling the Japanese frankly that we regarded the arrest of British subjects in Japan as an unfriendly act, andthat, unless they liquidated the matter quickly, we should takereprisals.The Prime Minister said that he was in favour of arrestinga number of Japanese without prior notice. An additional methodof reprisal was an unostentatious hampering by administrative action of Japanese shipping in our ports. By obstructing their trade in an inconspicuous manner we should involve them in financial loss, and give them perhaps a foretaste of how their trade would suffer in the event of war with this country.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that Sir robert craigie, in his telegram No. 1371 of the 30th July, had suggestedthat we should place as many difficulties and vexations as possible,short of actual detention, in the way of Japanese shipping.The War Cabinet agreed (a) That steps should be taken to arrest a certain number of japanese subjects in British territory against whom wecould make a case; but that we should not give theJapanese Government prior notice of our intention, orindicate in any way that these arrests were made byway of reprisal.(V) That the possibility of placing difficulties in the way of japanese shipping should be examined by the admiralty and the Ministry of Shipping in consultation.
Far East.Proposedwithdrawal ofBritishgarrisons in north China.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 189thConclusions,Minute 12.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 297).The Cabinet were informed that we had two battalions at shangai; the other detachments were very small. These two battalions were urgently needed at Singapore, and if withdrawnwe should give as our reason that they were required elsewhere.If we withdrew these troops now, we should suffer some lossof prestige; but a less serious loss than we should suffer if ourgarrisons should later be forced to surrender.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that, inview of the deterioration of the situation vis-a-vis Japan, thebalance of argument was in favour of withdrawal now, irrespective of whether the Italian troops in Shanghai were also withdrawn.In reply to a question, he agreed that it would be useful to askSir Robert Craigie whether the Japanese would take a withdrawalas a sign that we were &quot; on the run.&quot;In discussion it was agreed that, while it would be desirableto tell Australia and New Zealand if we intended to withdraw the garrisons, it was undesirable to consult them at this stage.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to ascertain the views ofHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tokyo, and to report again to the War Cabinet.The Middle 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the ChiefsEast, of Staff (W.P. (40) 293) recommending the compulsory evacuationEvacuation of of Service families from the Middle East.   It was contemplatedService families, that the families should be sent to India, in the first place, and(Previous thence to South Africa, and that they should leave for India in a reference: convoy which was due to sail from Egypt on the 25th August,W.M. (40) 175th subject to the passage of the Red Sea being reasonably secure at conclusions, that time.minute 10.) jn discussion the following points were made : (i) The recommendation of the Chiefs of Staff applied to service families in Palestine, as well as in Egypt,(ii) The view of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, wasthat the presence of Service families in Egypt would bea serious military liability in the not unlikely event of serious internal disorder,(iii) On the other hand, the evacuation, unless it coincided with the arrival of strong reinforcements, might looklike the first step in the withdrawal of British forces and have a bad effect on Egyptian morale. gibraltar and Malta were small fortresses, in which families were a real liability, but there were possibilities of dispersionin the Middle East, and the argument for evacuationwould not be so clear to the general public.The War Cabinet-Deferred a decision on this proposal pending discussionwith the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, who would be visiting this country in the near future.
India.Preparation ofmore troops for service overseas.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 189thConclusions,Minute 10.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 40thConclusions,Minute 1.)7.   The War Cabinet had before them A Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 291), the recommen-dations of which are set out in the Appendix to the presentConclusions.A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India(W.P. (40) 290) asking for-(i) Authority to communicate the recommendations of theChiefs of Staff to the Government of India, and toascertain that Governments ability to comply with therequirements detailed therein,(ii) Permission to authorise the Government of India toprepare forthwith to form the three divisions mentionedin recommendation (c) of the Chiefs of Staff, and alsoto raise such units in replacement as might be necessaryin order to meet India&apos;s own defence requirements.The Secretary of State for India explained that India hadalready either sent overseas, or earmarked for service overseas, the equivalent of three divisions and had. offered to make three more divisions available. The three divisions now recommended (makingnine in all) would be additional to these.The Government of India would have no difficulty in goingeven further, so far as man-power was concerned. The difficulty would be to equip further forces on the E.D.T. scale.The Secretary of State for War gave the War Cabinet certain information, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard Pile ofWar Cabinet Conclusions, on the progress which was being madewith the formation of the Divisions forming part of the approvedprogramme.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the Recommendations by the Chiefs of Staffcontained in W.P. (40) 291.(b) Authorised the Secretary of State for India to communi-cate with the Government of India on the lines proposedin W.P. (40) 290.India.(previous reference:W.M.

(40) 283), together with the lattets comments on this further draft.(b) A Memorandum by the Secretary(W.P. (G.) (40) 201) covering aViceroy outlining his ideas forExecutive Council and for the proposed War AdvisoryCouncil.The Prime Minister said that it would be seen that the Viceroyaccepted his revision of the draft, subject to one amendment.The following amendments were agreed to, in the course ofdiscussion, in the new paragraph 7 drafted by the Prime Minister(W.P. (40) 295) :-Paragraph 7, page 3, line 4. Omit the words in italics.Paragraph 7, page 3, line 8.

(40) 216thConclusions,Minute 3.)Internment ofDutchmen.9. The War Cabinet were informed that Lord Lytton wouldprobably accept the Chairmanship of the Advisory Council onAliens. Sir Walter Citrine could not himself serve as a member ofthe Council.The Prime Minister undertook to explain to Sir Walter,whom he was seeing that afternoon, that, while the T.U.C. couldnot be asked to nominate a member, the War Cabinet would be glad if he would submit one or two names privately.Further reference was made to representations made by theNetherlands Minister that two prominent Dutchmen had been interned.The Home Secretary said that two complaints only had beenmade by the Dutch Minister, one of which had since been with-drawn. The Home Secretary undertook to explore the suggestionthat Vigilance Committees should be appointed, representative ofthe different nationalities concerned. He thought that somearrangements on these lines could be made and would prove helpful.The Prime Minister said that our position was now con-siderably more secure than it had been some two months earlier.At that time we had had very few trained and equipped troops inthis country, and considerable numbers of aliens had been at large.He thought that it would now be possible to take a somewhat lessrigid attitude in regard to the internment of aliens.The Home Secretary agreed, but thought that it would be undesirable that there should be too violent a reaction from thepolicy previously enforced.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,August 1, 1940.
APPENDIX.Preparation of more Troops in India for Service Overseas.Recommendation of the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 291) (see Minute 7).9. (a) We recommend that we should ask the Government of India toprepare and replace the following units for service overseas : 1 Brigade Group by end of July 1940.1 Brigade Group by the end of September 1940.1 Motor Cavalry Brigade by the end of January 1941.6 Infantry Brigade Groups by May 1941.(If the artillery and ancillary troops for these brigade groups cannot be found,the infantry brigades should be prepared without them. The field artilleryregiment offered can be accepted on a horsed basis. If the provision of driversand technical personnel presents no difficulty, the first-line transport of allinfantry brigades should be on M.T. basis and early steps should be taken toprovide the necessary vehicles.)(6) We consider that, in principle, forces required to fight a first-class enemyshould be equipped to E.D.T. scale. Forces sent overseas to carry out internal security or L. of C. duties, or to a theatre where a first-class enemy is unlikely tobe met, may be equipped to the highest scale which India herself can provide. Wesuggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government undertake to provide all equipment required from United Kingdom or foreign sources up to full E.D.T. scale, and alsoto replace all such equipment that has already been supplied to forces overseasby India from her own stocks. This should be completed by April 1941 or as soonas possible after that date, taking into account our responsibility in other partsof the world.*(c) We recommend that the Government of India should be informed that,in addition to forces already earmarked in India and the forces mentioned inAppendix &quot; A,&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government anticipate having to request thepreparation of further forces amounting to three divisions, the first by August1941 and the other two by the end of that year.(e) We consider that, for the present, Middle East requirements take prece-dence over all plans for assistance to Afghanistan. In any case, such assistance should be limited to the forward move to Jalalabad-Kandahar. It is recognisedthat the despatch of forces overseas from India must be dependent upon theretention in India of adequate forces for the defence of the North-West frontier and for internal security.* Training scales of weapons (e.g. Mortars, A/T rifles, &amp;c.) should be sent to India as andwhen such equipments become available.
