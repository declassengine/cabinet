The Chief of the Air Staff gave the following information.During the daylight hours of the 7th July the main enemy attack had been concentrated against South coast ports and shipping inthe Straits of Dover. Bombs had been dropped at various pointsbetween Dover and Falmouth. The material damage was slight,but 27 persons had been killed. During the evening two enemyraids had been reported off Dungeness. The first, comprising30 fighters and 10 bombers, had made an attack on shipping, but no damage had been reported. The second had comprised 18 air-craft. During the engagement which had ended these raids, theenemy had lost 6 aircraft together with one &quot; probable.&quot; our casualties totalled one aircraft shot down and three missing.Portland had been bombed again early that morning but itwas believed that no serious damage had resulted.On the night of the 6th-7th July, Kiel had been attacked by three Whitleys.On the 7th July most of the bombers despatched by day toattack targets in Germany had abandoned their tasks, owing to lack of cloud cover. One aircraft, however, had penetrated toGotha, some 300 miles from the coast, and had attacked an aircraft factory.By night bombers had been despatched to attack dock and ship-building yards in Germany and to carry out mining operations in the Baltic. Reports were not yet available.Our total losses in bombers in the previous twenty-four hourshad amounted to four missing.Reconnaissance having shown a large number of barges atOstend, a force had been despatched to attack this target. the objective had not been located but direct hits had been made onthe dock gates and on a large ship.Various bombing attacks had been carried out in Libya and in italian East Africa. A Sunderland flying boat had sunk a U-boatin the Mediterranean.Malta had been raided on three occasions. Two enemyaeroplanes had been shot down, and some damage and casualties had resulted from the bombing.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M.

The First Sea Lord said that during the raid on Malta thesubmarine Olympus had received direct hits, which would take somemonths to repair.The 3rd Cruiser Squadron and four destroyers had hit, andprobably sunk, two Italian supply ships in Bardia harbour.It was feared that the British submarine Shark had been lost.She was overdue and no news had been received from her. TheGermans claimed to have picked up the crew of a submarine.Two Estonian vessels, one Swedish vessel and one Panamanianvessel had been torpedoed in the Western Approaches.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.[21522]b 2

Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.(previous erence:W.M. (40) 196th _____Conclusions,Minute 1.)Merchant 5.   The Minister of Information and the First Lord of theShipping. Admiralty asked that further consideration should be given to thePublication of decision reached at the Meeting referred to in the margin, thatlosses. the publication of losses of merchant shipping should be suspended.(Previous Particulars of losses of merchant ships were published by the enemy,Reference: and failure by us to publish any figures would encourage the spreadW.M. (40) 191st of rumours.Conclusions, Thg prime Minister thought that it was a mistake to publishi&apos; mute 4.) detailed figures of the sinkings of merchant vessels. Even whenthe enemy thought he knew the facts, Press and broadcast reportsgave him valuable confirmation. The enemy refrained from publishing information as to the effect of our mining operations,which we should be very glad to get.In discussion, considerable importance was attached tochoosing a favourable moment for stopping publication. The figuresfor the week ending the 1st July were a good deal better thanthose of the preceding week. On the other hand, it was hoped that,while the figures for the ensuing week might not be so favourable,better figures would be shown in two or three weeks&apos; time.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that the publication of weekly figuresof sinkings should cease.(2) Decided that publication should cease when favourableresults had been shown for a week or two.Eire. 6.   The Prime Minister said that reports had recently beenReports of received to the effect that the Germans had been buying up land,aerodromes in removing hedges and filling up ditches at two or three places nearSouthern Eire. Queenstown. This information had been passed to the Air Attacheat Dublin, and to Colonel Archer. So far as War Office informationwent, however, no permanent guards had been left in the neighbour-hood, and it seemed doubtful whether serious steps had been takento frustrate a possible German landing in this district.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs tomake enquiries into these reports, through the UnitedKingdom representative in Dublin.Sweden.Seizure ofSwedishdestroyers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 183rdConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to telegramNo. 816 from our Minister at Stockholm, reporting that the SwedishAdmiralty had made strong complaints at the treatment of theSwedish destroyers by the British Navy, alleging that considerable damage had been caused.
(PreviousReferenceThe First Lord of the Admiralty said that it was proposed to invite Lloyd&apos;s Agent at Gothenberg to act as an intermediary, andto give him authority to arrive at a settlement with the. swedish government in regard to certain items of damage for which, inA &quot; the Admiralty view, we must accept responsibility.   This list hadbeen furnished by the Vice-Admiral of the Northern Patrol. Ifthe Swedish authorities made a claim for damage in respect ofother items, Lloyd&apos;s Agent would be instructed to report to theAdmiralty.The Prime Minister said that he thought it was implicit in theagreement to return the destroyers to Sweden, that we should make good any damage for which we were responsible.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he under-stood that the concession in regard to aircraft which the Ministerof Aircraft Production was most anxious to obtain from the swedish government was the suspension of the contracts which they had placed in the United States for the construction of aircraft.   This&apos;  &apos; \ &apos;     s  was of more importance than the sale to us of aircraft now on conclusions,      passage to Sweden from the United States of America.Minute 6.) -The War Cabinet-Authorised the First Lord of the Admiralty to instructLloyd&apos;s Agent at Gothenberg to act as proposed at &quot; A &quot;above.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that he hoped to circulate that afternoon a Paper dealing with the various issues arising out of the telegrams recently received from sir stafford Cripps. This Paper contained the suggestion that theWar Cabinet should consider whether we should now make someW.M. (40) 194th approach to Turkey.Conclusions, The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Minute 5.)U.S.S.R.Anglo-soviet relations.(previous reference:France. 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theAnglo-French Marquis de Castellane, the Charge d&apos;Affaires at the french relations. Embassy, had that morning presented the communication from the(Previous French Government, the substance of which had been conveyedReference:        informally to the Foreign Office the previous day.  He (the ForeignW.M. (40) 196th Secretary) had said that he would send a reasoned reply withinConclusions,      24 hours.   He had asked the Charge d&apos;Affaires so to inform his minute 4.)        Government, and to say that we should probably make some reference to the possibility of bilateral representation.   The Charged&apos;Affaires had said that, pending receipt of our reply, he would remain at his post.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.France.Members ofFrench civil and militarymissions inLondon.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 195thConclusions,Minute 6.)10. Sir R. Vansittart said that his Committee had at firstconsidered that some 150 persons belonging to these Missions should at once be segregated.   This total included (a) Those who were actively opposing General de Gaulle.(b) Those who possessed highly specialised knowledge.(c) Those whose services might be specially useful to France ifthe relations between the two countries deteriorated stillfurther.Since that decision had been taken the French Embassy had sent a communication which seemed to portend the impendingrupture of diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom. In this event, categories (b) and (c) would still be required to be retained
in this country, probably permanently, but his first instinct hadbeen not to segregate persons in category (a), but to secure their immediate departure from this country. This would, however, take time. He had just been informed that Admiral Muselier hadcomplained that &quot;Admiral odend&apos;hal&apos;hal and the Staff of the NavalMission were actively engaged in endeavouring to detach membersof his (Admiral Musilier&apos;s) staff from General de Gaulle. AdmiralMusilier feared that, if this were allowed to continue, he would lose all his personnel. In these circumstances, he (Sir R. Vansittart)adhered to the view that all the 150 people concerned should besegregated until such time as arrangements could be made for the departure of those who did not wish to stay and were not requiredto remain.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that not much evidencehad hitherto been produced in regard to the subversive activitiesof the members of the French Naval Mission. The Admiralty had hitherto felt that the Naval Mission was still useful as a channel of communication with the French Government, in view of thesituation in regard to the French Fleet.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that theadvantages of segregating members of the Missions who possessedsecret information might be outweighed by the irritation to whichthis would give cause. M. Corbin had warned the Foreign Officeagainst taking action to aggravate the difficult position betweenthe two countries. He asked whether it was possible to segregateonly cypherers, and others who possessed vital information, andto send the rest back to France. If, however, as appeared to be thecase, General de Gaulle&apos;s position was being undermined by theactivities of members of the Missions, he agreed that on balancethere was a case for segregating all the persons concerned as atemporary measure.The Prime Minister said that, as regards the Admiralty point,there would always be a channel of communication with the FrenchGovernment as long as the Charge d&apos;Affaires remained here. he understood that no telegrams were, in fact, being received by admiral odend&apos;hal&apos;hal. He thought that the segregation of the FrenchMissions would form a useful topic for negotiations with theFrench Government, who would be informed frankly that it wasnecessary to retain certain persons and that, in the meanwhile, theremainder were being segregated pending discussion of thearrangements for their departure.The Secretary of State for War suggested that the membersof the French Missions might be informed that they were being asked to stay at Worcester College, Oxford, temporarily, pendingarrangements to be made thereafter for their departure.The War Cabinet agreed as follows :  (1) That arrangements should be made for the 150 members ofFrench Naval, Military, Air and Civilian Missionsfalling in the various categories described by Sir R.Vansittart to be segregated at Worcester College,Oxford, as the guests of His Majesty&apos;s Government, asa temporary measure, pending settlement of future arrangements. The allocation of responsibility forcarrying out these measures should be settled bySir R. Vansittart&apos;s Committee.(2) That those members of the Missions who possessed secret information of vital importance to this country shouldbe retained indefinitely, and that this ban might be madeto cover those persons who might be open to retaliationon account of their refusal to return to France.
Gibraltar.Refugees at casablanca.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 129thConclusions,Minute 9.)11. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the HomeSecretary had informed him that some 13,000 Gibraltarians hadbeen evacuated from Gibraltar to Morocco, and that the french authorities might wish to ship them to this country.The Secretary of State for the Home Department and Ministerof Home Security said that it was desirable to prevent these refugees from being landed in this country if possible, as we had nomeans of dealing with them except in internment camps. It was feared, however, that opportunity might be taken to embark them on the ships which were now taking French troops from this countryback to Morocco.The War Cabinet agreed That it was most undesirable that these refugees shouldbe brought to this country. In order to prevent this, theAdmiralty should give orders for only one or two of theships carrying the French troops to enter Casablanca ata time, and that, until these ships had come out empty, theother ships carrying troops should not be allowed to enter the harbour.Food Rationing.Tea, margarineand cooking fats.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 115thConclusions,Minute 9.)12. The Prime Minister read a letter from the Minister ofFood reporting that he had reached the conclusion that tea mustbe rationed, at a little below present consumption. It wasimpossible to give the public any notice, and he wished to make anOrder that evening. He also proposed, in a fortnight&apos;s time, to ration margarine and cooking fats, in addition to butter. these were precautionary measures in case our supplies were badlydisturbed by bombing. He was anxious to mention this in a broadcast that evening, but he thought that the War Cabinet shouldbe aware of the proposed extension of the rationing system.The War Cabinet-Approved the above proposals of the Minister of Food.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 8, 1940.
