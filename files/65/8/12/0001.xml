The Chief of the Air Staff gave the following information :During the previous day the enemy had delivered two main attacks against our shipping and ports. &quot;The first at 11 a.m. off Manstonhad consisted of one Dornier escorted by 30 Fighters. The enemy had lost one Fighter (confirmed) and four probables. The second attack, which had consisted of about 120 aircraft, had been inter-cepted between 1 -30 and 2 p.m. between Dover and Dungeness. Theenemy had lost 9 or 10 aircraft (confirmed) and several otherprobable casualties. During the previous day&apos;s engagements it was estimated that the enemy had lost 14 machines (certain) and 22(probable). Our losses had been two machines shot down and twocrashed on landing.Reference was made to the difficulty of protecting south coastconvoys by aircraft. The War Cabinet were informed that these convoys, which had orders to proceed close in-shore, would bereduced to the minimum along the south coast.During the previous day the enemy had made harassing raids against our ports on the south and west coasts. Docks and shipping had been attacked and the casualties had been greater than usual.The importance of giving air raid warnings of daylight raidswas emphasised, and the Minister of Home Security said that hewas seeing the Commander-in-Chief, Fighter Command, that evening on the matter.The previous day six Blenheims had been sent to attack an aircraft factory at Brunswick. Five of our machines were missing and a further machine was missing from an attack againstSt. Omer aerodrome.In reply to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff said that orders had already been given to use our bombers economically in daylight raids.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.MilitaryOperations.(previous reference erence:W.M.

The attack had been made by regular troops withsupport from light machine guns and mortars.The Secretary of State for War gave to the War Cabinet an account of certain projected operations in the Middle East, detailsof which are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said there was nodoubt the Germans were assembling a force in Norway. . This mightwell be intended to be used for a raid on Scotland or perhaps theShetland, Orkney or Faroe Islands.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Nasal 3.   The First Sea Lord said that the Mediterranean Fleet,Operations. which had been refuelling at Malta, was starting that morning to(Previous return to Alexandria covering two convoys.  An attack on AugustaEef erence: by Swordfish of the Fleet Air Arm had been carried out duringW:M. (40) 199th the previous evening.   The harbour had been found empty, but oneConclusions, destroyer and one hulk had been sunk by four aircraft in a smallMinute 6.) harbour two miles north of Augusta.
The The Mediterranean Fleet had been bombed continuously duringMediterranean,   the 8th July between Cyrenaica and Crete.   A hit on H.M.S.Gloucester&apos;s bridge had killed her Captain and inflicted severalcasualties. This attack had not, however, prevented her taking partin the brush with the Italian Fleet.Force &quot; H &quot; was due at Gibraltar that morning. It had been confirmed that the bombing of this force during their sweep on thewestern Mediterranean had been carried out by Italian aircraft.(Previous The First Lord of the A dmiralty undertook to make enquiriesReference: regarding the whereabouts of the ship, with French politicians on W.M.

The Prime Minister said that further consideration hadbeen given to the question whether operations should be taken against the Jean Bart. The ship could not be made serviceableunder many months and without being sent to a dockyard. In thecircumstances the Admiralty took the view that we should nowinform the French Naval Authorities that we proposed to take nofurther action in regard to the French ships in French Colonial orNorth African ports. We should, of course, reserve the right totake action in regard to French warships proceeding to enemy-controlled ports.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to refer to thismatter in his broadcast statement on Sunday (see Minute 9).It was pointed out that we should be taking a certain risk indelaying this announcement until the 14th July, and it wassuggested that an interim communication might be made throughAdmiral Godfroy.reference was made to the position of the French armed merchant Cruiser Caraibe at Mombasa. The general view was thatthis vessel should be detained, but that the crew should be sent backto France in another ship.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements and invited the First Lordof the Admiralty, after consultation with the PrimeMinister, to send a message through Admiral Godfroy onthe lines suggested at &quot; X &quot; above.France.Merchantshipping inBritish ports.5. The War Cabinet were informed that a number of Frenchliners had been detained. This action had been taken at the requestof the Ministry of Shipping, in retaliation for action which theFrench had taken against British shipping. There was a marginin our favour estimated at 200,000 tons of shipping. This matter was under consideration by the Ministry of Shipping.France.Polish and belgian gold.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 188thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. Reference was made to the Polish and Belgian goldremoved from France. It was believed that this gold had been takeninland from the French Colonial port to which it had been taken.No reply had been sent by the French Government to the request that they should arrange the transhipment of this gold&apos; to theUnited States.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to make further enquiries into this matter at an early date.
France.Anglo-french relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 197thConclusions,Minute 9.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad now received a reply to the effect that, while the French Govern-ment&apos;s decision in regard to the withdrawal of representationcould not be modified, the French Government contemplated thecontinuance of representation for purposes of liquidation ofeconomic and other matters. M. Paul Morancl, who was already a Minister in the French Diplomatic Service, would be appointed for this purpose, and he would have associated with him someonefrom the French Embassy who had not acted as head of the diplomatic Mission.The Foreign Secretary said that he took this as an indication that the French Government did not intend to close down theirrepresentation in this country entirely. He proposed that we should accept these suggestions and appoint a Consul-General at Vichy, inorder to balance the French representation in this country.The War Cabinet approved this proposal.France.Members ofFrench civil andmilitarymissions inLondon.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 198thConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that two,clays ago the War Cabinet had agreed that the measures ofsegregation already approved should proceed, notwithstanding theWar Cabinet&apos;s decision that we should endeavour to continuediplomatic relations with France.Subsequently, however, with the Prime Minister&apos;s approval, ithad been decided to suspend action on the measures of segregation.The Prime Minister said that it had now come to notice thatone of the Attaches of the French Embassy had been circulatingpamphlets describing His Majesty&apos;s Government in mostopprobrious terms. . Action must be taken to prevent occurrences ofthis nature.The Foreign Secretary said that these matters were under active consideration by Sir Robert Vansittart&apos;s Committeeassisted by the Service Departments. Every effort was being madeto comb out undesirables. The Vansittart Committee were stil&apos;of opinion that it was preferable to send back to France as many aspossible of the members of the Missions in London. The alternative of detention in this country should, it was thought, be reserved for those members of the Missions who were in possession of highlysecret information, and for persons who would welcome some coverto avoid having&apos;to return to France.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.France. 9.   The Prime Minister said that he proposed to broadcast on proposed broad- Sunday evening. In his speech he would refer to our relations withcast by the the French. He would say that it was not proposed to take anyPrime Minister, further action against units of the French Fleet, in particular theJean Bart, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded thatphase of the war as being over. He proposed to strike a restrainedand not unfriendly note, and might refer to the French as anoppressed people, who would be liberated by the defeat of Germany.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that in any public statement it would be better to describe any Frenchmen whowere well disposed towards us as anti-Nazi or anti-German, ratherthan as pro-Ally or &quot; free Frenchmen.&quot;The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
France.Treatment ofFrenchnationals in thiscountry in theevent of warwith France.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 189thConclusions,Minute 6.)10.   The War Cabinet-(a) Approved   the   Memorandum  by  the  Home   secretary covering the Report of the Aliens Advisory Committee(W.P. (G.) (40) 175).(b) Agreed that, if action had to be taken on the recommenda-tions of the Committee, the Aliens Advisory Committeeshould keep in touch with the Vansittart Committee.Evacuation ofChildren from great Britain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 199thConclusions,Minute 1.)11. The Lord President of the Council handed round a revised draft announcement which he had prepared, in consultation withthe Departments concerned, in pursuance of the Cabinet conclusionsreferred to in the margin.The War Cabinet-Approved the draft announcement subject to a minordrafting amendmentsParliament. 12.   Reference was made to two Members of Parliament whoM.P.s absent had recently left the country for reasons which seemed quitetrom the inadequate,country. The War Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary to prepare for their considera-tion the draft of a bill declaring vacant the seats ofMembers of Parliament who absented themselves from thiscountry without good cause for a specified period.The Far East.Japanesedemand forclosing the burma Road.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 199thConclusions,Minute 4.)13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams : Foreign Office telegram to Tokyo No. 671, in which HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador was informed that the Foreign secretary had been about to instruct, him to propose that for a period ofthree months the transit of the materials in dispute shouldnot be banned but be limited to the quantities carried duringthe corresponding period last year.The telegram went on to say that the Secretary of Statestill preferred this solution, if the Ambassador could obtainit. If he could not, he was authorised to put forward at once a solution in the form suggested in paragraph 4 of Tokyotelegram No. 1196, i.e., a suspension of transit of war materials for three months. The more restricted the list of war materials,the easier it would be to defend our decision.Washington telegram No. 1286, in which Lord Lothianreported that American opinion would probably regard our action about the Burma Road as imposed upon us by the necessities of the European situation.The Foreign Secretary said that he was making the necessaryconsequential communications to the United States and ChineseGovernments.* Subsequent to the Meeting, it was decided to postpone this announcementand to give further consideration to the terms of the draft at the Meeting of theWar Cabinet to be held on the ensuing day.
U.S.S.R. 14.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theBritish policy. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 254), to which(Previous were annexed telegrams giving an account of Sir S. Cripps&apos;reference: interview with M. Stalin, and the former&apos;s observations thereon.W.M. (40) 197th The conclusion reached by the Foreign Secretary was that, whileConclusions, avoiding in our dealings with Soviet Russia anything which mightMinute 8.)        alienate Turkey, we ought to test the Soviet&apos;s intentions by offering to act as intermediary between the Soviet Government and theTurkish Government.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that while hewas not very sanguine that anything would come of this move, hethought that it was worth trying. The first step would be toinform the Turkish Government of M. Stalin&apos;s remarks in thisconnection to Sir S. Cripps, and to enquire whether the TurkishGovernment would agree to His Majesty&apos;s Government asking theSoviet Government to state more precisely what they had in mind.The War Cabinet-Approved the despatch to our Ambassador at Ankara ofthe draft telegram appended to the Foreign Secretary&apos;sMemorandum as Annex &quot; C,&quot; which should be repeated to Moscow.Aliens.Conditions ininternmentcamps.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 137thConclusions,Minute 11.)15. The Lord Privy Seal said that some disquiet had been expressed in the Debate in the House of Commons the previous evening as to the conditions in internment camps. There was muchto be said for setting up some organisation which would relieve theWar Office and the Home Office of their existing responsibilities in regard to the administration of these camps.The Secretary of State for the Home Department and Ministerof Home Security said that, subject to the Security Servicesretaining responsibility in regard to the selection of those who wereinterned, he favoured a suggestion on these lines. The custody ofinternees was the responsibility of the War Office, but he had setup a Department under Sir John Moylan which was responsiblefor dealing with questions affecting his Department after alienshad been interned. Any question of obtaining service from thosewho had been interned raised issues which would have to be dealtwith by some new organisation. He favoured the appointment ofa Committee to consider this matter. The problem would not bean easy one, since most of those who had been interned could notrender any very special or valuable service.The Secretary of State for War agreed with the view expressed.Steps were being taken to raise a Pioneer Battalion from aliens.The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal, after consultation with theother Ministers concerned, to submit to the War Cabinetsuggestions for dealing with the conditions in internmentcamps, and, in particular, with the question of findingsuitable employment for internees.In discussion the view was expressed that no time ought to be lost in coming to terms with Japan. The present JapaneseGovernment might at any moment by succeeded by an anti-BritishGovernment, who might declare war upon us. It was also pointedout that one London daily paper had taken the line that morningthat we ought to go to war with Japan.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
16. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (40) 257) proposing that adeclaration should be made to the effect that all waters withinthirty miles of Italian territory (including the Libyan coast) weredangerous to navigation. This declaration would cover all the channels between Crete and Turkey.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that he favoured thecourse proposed, as a first step. It was important not to relaxthe pressure of our Contraband Control. The quantities of grainand oil exportable from Roumania exceeded the amounts whichcould be carried over land or by the Danube, and it was therefore essential to prevent sea traffic between Roumania and Italy.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals set out in the First Lord&apos;sMemorandum.Air Raid 17.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byCasualties. the Minister of Information (W.P. (G.) (40) 178) urging recon-Question of sideration of the decision reached by the War Cabinet on thepublication. 3rd July that reports of casualties caused by German air-raids(Previous should in future be stated in general terms and should not giveReference: details of the precise number killed and injured.W.M. (40) 192nd        In favour of the publication of the exact number, it was urgedConclusions, that the withholding of publication of facts known to a largeMinute 3.) number of people in this country created doubt and disquiet.The Minister of Information and the Minister of home security said that evidence in this sense was accumulating in reports from the Regions. Public opinion in this country could be relied upon to accept bad news, provided they knew that they were being given the full facts.On the other hand, it was argued that the Home Front was now the front-line trench, and that there was no more reason to publish the detailed casualties inflicted on civilians each day than therewould have been to publish the daily casualties inflicted in particularsectors of the battle front in Flanders. The day-to-day publicationof the numbers of civilians killed must have a depressing effect on public opinion here, and must have some value to the enemy.The Prime Minister suggested that, if it was necessary to publish information as to total civilian casualties sustained, this could be done periodically.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the present ruling should continue in force for a further week, subject to reconsideration at the endof that time.Italy.proposed declaration ofdangerous areasoff the coast ofItalj andItalian Colonies.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 11, 1940.
