1. The First Sea Lord reported that early that morning therehad been an attack by a U-boat on an outward bound convoy 200miles West-North-West of Malin Head. He added that the FirstLord was circulating a paper that day on the measures for dealingwith enemy attacks on merchant shipping.The War Cabinet-Agreed to consider the First Lord&apos;s Memorandum at their meeting on the following day.Middle East. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported certain minoroperations which had taken place in the Middle East.(i) Palestine. Haifa had been raided by 10 Italian aircraft.Between 60 and 100 bombs had fallen, causing negligibledamage. The morale of the population had remainedgood.(ii) Egypt. The Italians had dropped four bombs in themiddle of Lake Maryut.(iii) Sudan. A mechanised patrol had successfully raided theenemy post of Adardeb, 60 miles North-North-East ofKassala.(iv) East Africa. There had been enemy bombing north of theGarissa ferry, causing no damage or casualties.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Naval, Militaryand air operations.Shipping losses.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 235thConclusions,Minute 2.)Air Operations. The Chief of the Air Staff reported that the transformer(Previous station outside Frankfurt had been blown up on the night of the reference: 27th-28th.W.M. (40) 234th The bombing of the Berlin targets on the previous night had.Conclusions,      been most successful.Minute 1.) The casualties for the previous day&apos;s operations had been : Our Own 20 Fighters (7 pilots and 3 air gunners being killed ormissing).Enemy 28 certain14 probable10 damaged.Bombing policy. The Prime Minister said that he proposed sending a con-gratulatory message to Bomber Command on the bombing of the berlin targets. In this message he would again refer to the restraintexercised by our pilots in refraining from unloading their bombs ifthey were not certain of hitting military targets.In view of the indiscriminate bombing practised by theGermans we might in the near future have to consider making atemporary but marked departure from our policy of bombing onlymilitary targets.Reserves of The Minister for Aircraft Production said that the recentaircraft: heavy air fighting had made considerable inroads on our reserves ofSupply of aircraft, while production had been impeded to a perceptible, thoughaircraft to the    not serious, extent by .the German bombing.    It had becomeMiddle Bast and necessary, in his opinion, that we should conserve our resources andto South Africa should cease shipping aircraft abroad to South Africa and theMiddle East.It was pointed out, however, that the situation was not suchas to justify any interference with the supply of more up-to-datemachines for our pilots in the Middle East. The small number ofHurricanes earmarked for the Union of South Africa had beenconsidered necessary by the Defence Committee, and would be usedin active operations.
The War Cabinet-Agreed that it was undesirable to interfere with the supplyof aircraft earmarked for the Middle East and the Unionof South Africa.Violation of The Secretary of State for. Foreign Affairs stated that the swiss neutrality Swiss Minister had made a further protest against the violationby British of Swiss neutrality by British aircraft. The Minister hadaircraft. volunteered the suggestion that, in order to appease Swiss public(Previous opinion, we might arrange for one of our aircraft to make a forcedBeference: landing in Switzerland. He (the Foreign Secretary) imagined that.M. (40) 230th this idea would not be acceptable, but thought that there might be conclusions, a variant. How would it be, for example, for us to announce that,Minute 1.)        say, a couple of bombers had been brought down by A.A. fire inSwitzerland, and for the Swiss Government to issue a similarcommunique ?Another suggestion was put forward that an obsolete civil aircraft might be instructed to do a forced landing in Switzerland,and to destroy the machine.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for Air to consider whether somesubterfuge on the above lines could be practised.Air Raids:Responsibilityfor Disposal ofUnexplodedBombs.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 230thConclusions,Minute 4.12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (40) 340) asking for confirmation of the following arrangements : (i) The Admiralty and Air Ministry to be responsible for thedisposal of unexploded bombs within their establish-ments : &apos;(ii) The War Office, in addition to their own Service respon-sibility, to be responsible for the disposal of unexplodedbombs in all other areas, including the establishments of the Ministry of Aircraft Production.The War Cabinet approved the arrangements set out in w.P. (40) 340.Air Raids:Bomb craters on Aerodromes.3. The Prime Minister said that he had visited an aerodromeon the previous day at which the arrangements for filling up thebomb craters left after a raid were very inadequate. In additionto the local preparations on aerodromes, there ought to be mobilesections of experts with proper appliances who could be rushedto any spot where they were needed. No crater on an aerodromeshould remain unfilled for more than 24 hours. We could not afford to allow any of our aerodromes to be out of action.The War Cabinet took note that the Secretary of State forAir had this matter in hand.Air Raids:Repair of damage.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (40) 235thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Prime Minister said that he had been making enquiries into the consequences of air raids to the poorer classes. He hadnot been met with complaints, nor had he found that the localauthorities were backward in their measures for the repair of damage to property or for the provision of beds, meals, and subsistence allowances for the victims of the raids. The trouble was the inadequacy of the present legislative provision for com-compensating those who had lost their household effects, or the stock in
trade of their small businesses. General compensation in thesecases was being held over until after the war, on the theory thatit was necessary first to determine what the country could afford.His view was that considerably more would have to be done for persons of limited means. For example, it might be decided in such cases to pay 100 per cent, compensation for the loss of effectsup to the first  2,000. A fund would have to be built up to providethis compensation; it might be fed by a levy on all house-holders.He had spoken to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had promised to look into the position.The Lord Privy Seal said that he hoped that his report onthe adequacy of the measures now being taken for the relief of distress and the repair of damage would be ready for consideration the following day.French Colonies.Adherence of west african colonies toGeneral de gaulle.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 235thConclusions,Minute 6.)economic assistance for french Coloniesstanding by the alliance.New Caledonia.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it looked now as if the whole of French Equatorial Africa and the cameroons, in addition to the Chad territory, was swinging away from the Vichy Government. General de Gaulle&apos;s representatives had entered the Cameroons and were believed to have persuadedDuala to acknowledge General de Gaulle. A telegram had beenreceived from Leopoldville stating that General de Gaulle&apos;representatives had asked that H.M.S. Bridgewater should be sentto Duala.The Foreign Secretary also referred to telegrams 124 and 128received from Leopoldville. He had consulted the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and had prepared a draft telegram in reply.The War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theChancellor of the Exchequer to consider the provision ofeconomic aid for French Colonies standing by the Alliance.The First Sea Lord said that a sloop had arrived at NewCaledonia from Tahiti and the Captain, a pro-Vichy-Governmentman, was causing trouble. General de Gaulle had requested thatthe Resident in the New Hebrides, who was one of his supporters,should be sent to New Caledonia in order to deal with the situation,and that the sloop should be ordered back to Tahiti.The Australian Government might be asked to send the cruiserA delaide for this purpose.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thought that theAustralian Government should be given more information regardingthe circumstances of the case, before they were requested to take action which might antagonise the Vichy Government.The War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe First Lord of the Admiralty to supply the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs with information to enable him to ask the aid of the Australian Government in meeting General de Gaulle&apos;s request.
The UnitedStates.Supply of destroyers andother munitions of war.Proposed grantof base facilities in certainBritishterritories.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 235thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto certain further telegrams which had been received from washington, including telegrams Nos. 1853, 1854 and 1857. Theposition was now altered to the following extent : (1) The Americans had dropped their demand for theinclusion of a provision for arbitration. TelegramNo. 1857, however, showed that they might return tothis request.(2) The Americans wished us to divide our offer into two parts : (a) Facilities in Newfoundland and Bermuda, whichwould be a free gift.(b) The facilities offered in the Caribbean and inBritish Guiana, where it was proposed that thegrant of a 99 years&apos; lease should form the con-sideration for the transfer of the United states destroyers.(3) The Americans wished to deal separately with the transferof the remaining material offered to us, i.e., motor boats,flying boats and rifles, and the 150 to 200 aircraft whichhad been mentioned by President Roosevelt toMr. Mackenzie King.The Foreign Secretary mentioned several arguments in favourof clinching the bargain quickly on the terms now proposed by theUnited States Government. In particular, we could not afford to let slip the present opportunity of entering into closer association with the United States. Short of the United States declaring war on Germany, their association with our cause could hardly go further than was now proposed.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that, if the UnitedStates insisted on our entering into a bargain, it ought not to bean unfair bargain, such as was now proposed.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct Lord Lothian toaccept the United States Governments offer in its latestform. It should be made plain that we could not agreeto the restoration of the provision about an arbiter.(2) Invited the Minister of Information to give any necessaryguidance to the Press and the B.B.C. at the time of thepublication of the agreement.(3) Authorised the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs tocommunicate forthwith to the Dominion High Commis-sioners the telegrams exchanged between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,August 29, 1940.
