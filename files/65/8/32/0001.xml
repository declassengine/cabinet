4 f* i.lolThe UnitedStates.Supply of destroyers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 213thConclusions,Minute 3.)Eire.trade negotiations.1. The Prime Minister drew attention to telegram No. 1616from Washington in regard to the supply of Destroyers from theUnited States.The War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toprepare a draft reply to this telegram, in consultation withthe Prime Minister.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (G.) (40) 204)reporting the upshot of the discussions in recent months with aview to making a comprehensive agreement with Eire on a numberof trade questions. Substantial agreement had been reached on many points, but difficulties had arisen about the prices we should pay for butter, cheese and bacon from Eire.At a Meeting of United Kingdom Ministers held some monthsearlier, it had been decided that, on general grounds, it was desirable to make an agreement. Various methods had beendiscussed of giving Eire a make-weight for the lower prices whichwe were prepared to pay for her butter, cheese and bacon, in comparison with United Kingdom prices. The only method towhich serious objection had not been taken was to pay Eire theUnited Kingdom price for fat cattle, less a differential which represented a pre-war subsidy to home-produced cattle. this method would not give rise to a demand for similar treatment fromthe other Dominions, which did not export fat cattle to this country.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that agree-ment could not be reached unless this proposal was accepted.Tailing agreement, political relations between the two countries might deteriorate. Further, the negotiations had been veryprotracted, and the Irish would have some grievance if they were allowed to break down at this stage.In discussion, the view was expressed that this proposal wastantamount to a concealed cash subsidy of  500,000 a year to Irishfarmers.The Prime Minister saw strong objection to subsidising adisloyal Dominion. In principle the proposal should be rejected.In any case, the concession should not be made unless we drove ahard bargain for it.The view was also expressed that, if this concession was madeto Eire, we should meet with further demands that preferential treatment should be accorded to the agricultural exports of theother Dominions.From the point of view of the Ministry of Food, the proposal had few attractions. Eire was a near source of supply, but couldsend us very little.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, although politicalgoodwill might be absent, there was commercial goodwill betweenthe United Kingdom and Eire. If we broke with Eire now,a policy of increasing industrialisation might be adopted to our disadvantage. The view was also expressed that, while the coursetaken by the negotiations might be regrettable, it was now too late to draw back. It was also suggested that, if a concession was;made- (a) it should be given for twelve months only, subject to reviewthereafter;(&amp;) the concession should be so arranged as to ensure that wepaid no more than  500,000 a year, even if cattle prices in this country rose, or the number of fat cattle imported from Eire increased.[21613]b 2
The War Cabinet-(i) Invited the Minister of Shipping to circulate a Memo-randum showing the advantages it was hoped to obtain from the expansion of storage and shipping facilities in eire. If the offers already made by the Irish negotiatorsunder this head were inadequate, the Minister was askedto set out the extent to which he would wish to see thoseoffers improved.(ii) Pending the receipt of this Memorandum, deferred adecision on the proposals in the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.The baltic states.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 214thConclusions,Minute 6.)Proposals inregard to shipping.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Shipping (W.P. (G.) (40) 205) proposing the following action in regard to ships belonging to the Baltic States : (i) To detain in British ports all such ships,(ii) To bring into British ports, by persuasion or, if necessary,by force, as many more of these ships as possible. Shipsintercepted at sea should be brought into British portsunder armed guard,(iii) In order to prevent the complete immobilisation of thevessels in British ports, they should be requisitionedunder the Defence Regulations and put into service under the British flag.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs supported theseproposals. We should have trouble with Moscow over the line we proposed to take, but the U.S.S.R. did not determine their major policy in the light of minor events. Further, we had no assuranceas to the future of British financial and commercial interests inthe Baltic States. We should therefore get control of as many ofthese ships as possible, and hold them as a pledge.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Minister of Shippingsummarised above.Conscientious 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theObjectors. Minister   of   Labour   and   National   Service   (H.P.C. (40) 250)outlining a plan for a statutory scheme under which all personsregistered as conscientious objectors should be required to pay intoa Central Fund the difference between their wages or salaries andthe remuneration which they would have received as privatesoldiers.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that somepractical difficulties would be experienced in dealing withconscientious objectors who were in receipt of private means or were engaged in business on their own account and were notdependent upon salaries or wages. But he thought that ways couldbe found for dealing with these points. He proposed to deal withconscientious objectors who might have family or other obligations under the provisions applicable to private soldiers similarlysituated.Discussion showed that, in principle, a scheme on the lines proposed commended itself to the War Cabinet. The real test,however, was whether the principle could be satisfactorilyembodied in a draft Bill.The Secretary of State for War mentioned that one or twoconscientious objectors were serving in the War Office. This seemedto him to be open to objection.
The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service toarrange for the drafting and submission to the WarCabinet of a draft Bill to give effect to the scheme proposed.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the minister without Portfolio (W.P. (G.) (40) 207) enclosing a Memorandum onHolidays by the Minister of Labour and National Service(P.X. (40) 45), and an extract from the draft Conclusions of aMeeting of the Production Council held on the 5th August, 1940(P.X. (40) 9th Conclusions, Minute 1).The Minister without Portfolio said that the production council approved generally the proposals made by the Minister ofLabour and National Service, but thought that the proposed statement should be redrafted so as to make it clear that theremust be no slackening in production, and that holidays were beinggranted in order that production might be increased and notdiminished.The Minister of Labour anal National Service circulated a revised draft announcement (see the Appendix to these Minutes).The Minister emphasised the need for a period of recuperationbetween now and the end of September. He was afraid that, if nobreak was given, the effects on production would be serious, andthe risk of labour difficulties would be increased when the days grewshorter and we got into the blackout period.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that he was very anxious to avoid any suspicion that the Government wereencouraging the holiday spirit. Already aircraft production wasbeing affected by the holiday spirit and discussion of possibleholidays. He would much prefer that no public statement shouldbe made on the lines of the proposed announcement, and that thematter should be dealt with locally by the management of eachfactory, in the light of local conditions and of the productionsituation. At the present moment most of the aircraft factorieswere working six days a week. A general holiday stoppage wouldslow down aircraft production.In further discussion, very general agreement was expressed with the line taken in the Minister of Labour&apos;s draft Statement, towhich a number of minor amendments were suggested. The general view expressed was, however, that it would be undesirable to makeany public statement if it could be avoided. Thus in the Armyleave was being allowed up to 5 per cent., but no public statement had been made. Again, arrangements were being made for leave(on a reduced scale) in the Civil Service, but no announcement wouldbe made. A public statement might have undesirable effects notonly in this country, but on public opinion in the United States.The War Cabinet-(1) Expressed agreement in principle with the proposals setout in the draft Statement by the Minister of Labour and national Service.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service to take steps with a view to securing that arrangements forholidays in industry should be made locally, on the lines indicated in his draft Statement; and to bring to thenotice of those concerned the importance of avoiding anygeneral public statement on the subject.(3) Invited the Minister of Information to inform the repre-sentatives of the press that short holidays were being
allowed in industry; but to make it clear to them thatthe situation still remained dangerous, and that it was desirable to damp down any appearance of the holidayspirit and to avoid any public announcement as toholidays in industry.(4) Agreed that, if Questions were asked on the matter inParliament, the reply should be on the lines that suchholidays in industry were being allowed as wereabsolutely necessary in the interests of production, butthat no general holiday was possible this year.The Far East.Proposedwithdrawal ofBritishGarrisons in north China.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 217thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had now had a telegram from our Ambassador in Tokyo (No. 1474)reporting that he favoured the withdrawal of the British garrisons in North China. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs wasinforming the Governments of Australia and New Zealand, as wellas those of the Union of South Africa and Canada, that we proposed to withdraw the garrisons. The Poreign Secretary asked that, subject to their views, he should be authorised to inform ourAmbassadors at Tokyo and Washington that we had decided towithdraw the garrisons, and to set the machinery-in motion.The Prime Minister agreed with the course proposed. Hethought the two battalions withdrawn should be sent to Singapore,the garrison of which might perhaps also be reinforced by two moreIndian Battalions. The result would be a heavy reinforcement of singapore, and, if announced publicly, might help our prestige.The Secretary of State for War said that he would like tomake preliminary unobtrusive arrangements for the withdrawalforthwith.The War Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,subject to the consideration of any views that theDominion Governments might express, to inform ourAmbassadors at Tokyo and Washington that we had decided to withdraw the British garrisons from NorthChina.(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for War to makepreliminary unobtrusive arrangements to facilitate thewithdrawal of these garrisons.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,August 6, 1940.
APPENDIX.Holidays.Revised draft Statement by the Minister of Labour and National Service.(See Minute 5.)THE Government express their thanks and appreciation to all those engagedin industry for so readily foregoing their holidays and thereby serving the nationalpurpose.They desire to point out that even at this stage the situation is still so serious that anything in the nature of a general holiday arrangement is impossible.They are aware, however, that there is great need for steps to be taken toallow periods of rest for relaxation, especially between now and the end ofSeptember. What the Government are desirous of achieving is to give theseperiods of rest by means of breaks in such a way that production will not beimpeded. The increased output during these last three months has helped tonarrow the difference between our equipment and that of the enemy, but stillmore must be done, and it will have to be kept up for months ahead. It shouldbe remembered also that plant must be overhauled, boilers attended to and thewhole mechanism tuned up for the great effort of continued production.It remains the Governments view that in present circumstances completestoppages should not take place at establishments where holidays in rotation canbe arranged without detriment to production or essential services. Where thisis not practicable, the Government suggest that in non-essential industries andin those munition trades where the production is up to or in advance of schedule,a week&apos;s rest might be taken in one break. In other cases the problem might bemet by allowing a series of week-end breaks, say from the Friday night to thefollowing Tuesday morning. As circumstances vary so much in different cases,the best method would be for each industry to examine its own problem and toarrive at arrangements with the Government Production Departments so asto minimise any possible difficulty. The essential consideration in determining the desirability of a short break is whether it will assist in maintaining machinery in full working order and in keeping up the health and efficiency of the workers,and will thus increase production still more.
