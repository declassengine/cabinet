1. The Prime Minister said that 11 Hurricanes had flown offthe Aircraft-carrier Argus, and had landed in Malta. One of them had crashed on landing.The Highlander, off the north coast of Scotland, reported havingbrought down two Heinkels by machine-gun fire.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M.

The Prime Minister said that Sir Walter Citrine, whom(Previous he had seen the previous afternoon, had taken a rather rigid attitudeReference: ^ and had pressed that the Trade Union Congress should be askedW.M. (40) 217th to nominate a representative on any Committee which affected theConclusions, working classes. Sir Walter had referred in this connection to the minute 9.)        undertaking given by Mr. Chamberlain in October, 1939, as to con-sultation between Government Departments and the Trade UnionCongress.It Avas explained that Sir Walter Citrine had in mind a Notecirculated to Ministers in October, 1939, which contained a generalinjunction to consult with the Trade Union Congress, or individualTrade Unions where more appropriate, on all matters which werefelt to concern them.After discussion the War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) The Note circulated to Ministers in October, 1939, shouldbe re-circulated.(2) The Prime Minister would write to Sir Walter Citrineinforming him that this Note was being re-circulated,and sending him a copy of it.(3) The Foreign Secretary would invite Sir Walter Citrine togive him the name of a person whom he (Sir Walter)would recommend for appointment as a member of theAdvisory Council on Aliens. He would make it clearthat the Council must start work at once. In this letterhe would not ask Sir Walter Citrine to invite the TradeUnion Congress to nominate a member. On the otherhand, on this occasion no objection need be raised if sir Walter Citrine&apos;s reply took the form that the TradeUnion Congress nominated Mr. X, provided that nodelay was involved.France.Anglo-french relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 214thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 296) reportingGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s reactions to the suggestions made in his memorandum (W.P. (40) 288) on relations with. France. General de gaulle saw no reason why His Majesty&apos;s Government should not maintain contact with the Vichy Government, and doubted whetherleaflets produced in London and dropped from British aeroplaneshad much effect.The Foreign Secretary said that, this view notwithstanding, he did not propose to give up the right to drop leaflets, provided thatthose leaflets were not abusive of the Petain Government. Muchcould be done by leaflets of a factual description.The Minister of Information doubted whether to enter into negotiations with the Vichy Government at this stage was altogetherconsistent with our policy in other directions. He feared that, ifwe made one concession in order to be allowed to send an Agentto Vichy, we should be pressed to make other concessions later.The Foreign Secretary said that he did not attach very much importance to the step now proposed, but that he would much prefer,if a break was to come, that it should come from the French Govern-ment, and not from ourselves.
Evacuated and 4.   The Lord, Privy Seal said that the Attorney-General hadProtected raised with him the position of persons suffering from the effectsAreas. of evacuation.   The Courts Emergency Regulations did not meetEconomic tne case 0? a man wno was faced with a volume of debt pilingposition. UP against him.   This matter had been considered by the Schuster(Previous Committee, but their recommendations had not been adopted in full.Reference: At the time when the Schuster Committee had considered the matter,W.M. (40) 192nd ^he main problem had been presented by the evacuation of London.Conclusions, Since that time there had been large-scale evacuation from the minute 14.)&apos; coastal strip between Folkestone and&quot;Sher;i.ngham. The Attorney-General thought that the whole question should be reviewed in thelight of the new circumstances.The second point was the position of the Local Authorities inthis coastal strip. Many of these Authorities were virtuallybankrupt and at least one town (Lowestoft) was in the hands of a bank.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that the whole position shouldbe reviewed by a Ministerial Committee which should include oneof the Law Officers. This Committee should meet as soon as the officials of the Departments concerned had prepared a statementof the facts.The Chancellor of the Exchequer entirely agreed that thematter should be looked into. It would, however, be necessary toact very carefully, since concessions made to one set of people orof Authorities would almost certainly have re-actions elsewhere.He agreed that the Local Authorities must be helped. As a first line of defence it had been arranged that the Banks shouldnot take a narrow view of their position in relation to LocalAuthorities&apos; finance. He had every reason to believe that the Bankswere living up to their undertakings in this matter.The second line of defence would probably take the form of advances of the Exchequer block grants. But the concession made should not take the form of making good the rate of deficiency of theAuthority concerned for the period of the war. Money should be advanced now, but there should be no attempt to reach a final settlement during the war.The Minister of Health said that his Department was in touchwith the position. The critical time would come in Septemberwhen the local Authorities had to settle the poundage, at which theywould have to levy rates in order to make both ends meet.. Informa-tion on this point was being obtained. He agreed that an early settlement was important.As regards the position in the coastal belt generally, the WarCabinet were reminded that, on the last occasion when this matter had been before them, they had decided not to put into operation the scheme for the compulsory evacuation of all but essential people from the nineteen East Coast towns between Sheringham andFolkestone. Instead, a voluntary evacuation had been stimulatedfrom these towns. In the other protected areas on the East andSouth Coasts no similar measures had been taken to stimulateevacuation, but visitors were forbidden.General agreement was expressed with the view that, whilethe present position must be maintained between Sheringham andFolkestone, some relaxation was desirable and should be madeelsewhere on the coast.   In particular Brighton and BournemouthThe War Cabinet-Approved the draft reply to the French representative setout as Annex II to W.P. (40) 288, subject to the substitu-tion of the words &quot; abusive of &quot; for the words &quot; injurious to &quot; in paragraph 3.
were instanced. It would be important, however, that any suchrelaxation should be made by means of local notices, and that weshould avoid giving the impression that the danger of invasionwas regarded as past.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, as Acting Chairman of theLord Presidents Committee, to arrange for Meetingsof that Committee, which should be attended by other ministers concerned (including one of the Law Officersof the Crown) to consider what measures were required : (a) To   meet  the   financial   position  of   the   LocalAuthorities in the evacuated areas and of other local Authorities which had been hard hit by war conditions :(b) To deal with the growing burden of debt and obligations under contract incurred by persons affected by the movement of population resultingfrom the war.(2) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to advise whether the militarysituation permitted of the removal of the ban on visitors to towns in the protected areas excluding the townsfrom Sheringham to Folkestone both inclusive.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,August 2, 1940.
