Man Power.Calling up ofmen registeredf or militaryservice.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 174thConclusions,Minute 13.)MemorandumFire-fighting and policeservices.1.   The  War   Cabinet  had  before  them  a(W.P. (G.) (40) 166) by the Minister of Information.The Minister of Information said that the Home IntelligenceReports of the previous few days showed less anxiety than a weekago as to the delay in embodying the full man-power of the nationin the armed forces. In his Memorandum he had suggested thata Committee should be set up and invested with authority to takethe necessary powers for compulsion. He now thought that theCommittee should act in an advisory capacity.The Minister of Labour said that the Ministry of Labour had consistently been in the position to meet all requirements made upon it by the armed forces for new recruits. When he took office 175,000men had expressed preference for the Navy or the Air Force, but had not been interviewed because the Navy and the Air Force couldnot absorb the numbers which expressed a desire to enter those two services. The process of interviewing had been speeded up and102,000 of these men had now been made available for the Army.Again, arrangements had been made for men to serve for three orfour months as pioneers before starting on military training. Hethought the Secretary of State for War would agree that, owing tothe speeding up of the registration and medical examinationmachinery, the numbers of men available for the Army were nowahead of what the Army could absorb.So far as whole-time fire-fighting and police services were con-cerned an arrangement had been reached with the Minister of home security whereby volunteers from a recent registration group were,if suitable, directed under the Emergency Powers Act to performthese services.Agricultural Turning to agriculture, the Minister said that the demandslabour. made by farmers had been most disappointing.  Farmers had been urged for weeks to notify their requirements to the local offices ofhis Department, but the number of vacancies notified was far smaller than the number of unemployed agricultural workers on hisregisters. He was, however, in consultation with the Minister ofAgriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotland on this subject.With regard to the Women&apos;s Services, the Minister said thathe was endeavouring to secure the necessary recruits, but in Londonalone there were over 75,000 women registered for employment for whom no jobs were available. The opportunities for the employ -ment of women depended largely on the numbers of skilled men available. Owing to increasing mechanisation, twice as manyprecision workers were required as in the last war. To get moreIndustrial skilled workers he had authorised 40 training centres, the numbertraining. of centres at work had been increased to 17 and premises for afurther 7 had been secured. By dint of carefully selecting semi-skilled workers for training, 700 skilled men a week were now beingturned out from the training centres.As for the luxury and non-essential industry trade, the recentBoard of Trade Order would increase the number of unemployedindustrial workers by perhaps half a million and it would tax thepowers of Government organisations to fit this large number intoemployment of value to the country. He had recently appointedSir William Beveridge as Commissioner to undertake an investiga-tion into the whole question of the appropriate utilisation of theman-power and woman-power of the country. The Minister addedthat he considered that the facts of the position should be explained to the country so as to remove misconception.The Secretary of State for the Home Department and Ministerof Home Security, referring&apos; to the question of whole-time personnel for civil defence purposes, said that arrangements had been made that, when a class was called up, they were given the sameopportunity of joining these services as they were for joining theNavy or the Air Force.   Although there was no direct compulsion,[21509] b 2Women&apos;services.
he hoped by these means to obtain sufficient whole-time paidpersonnel. The problem of applying compulsion in any form to thepart-time voluntary personnel was more difficult. He was drawing up a scheme whereby the principle of compulsion could be applied,and he hoped this scheme would ensure that gaps in the part-timepersonnel service would be filled. The details of the scheme wouldbe settled within the next few days.The Secretary of Suite for War gave the following figures inregard to the man-power position : Between the 6th June and the 29th July, a period of a littleover 7 weeks, over 300,000 men would be conscripted into theArmy alone. During the same period 70,000 volunteers mightbe expected. The following figures gave some indication of thenumber of males of military age now serving in the armed forces of the Crown, or in the Mercantile Marine :Total Male Population (20 to 41 years)......      7,350,000Reserved    occupations    (including   MercantileMarine)     ......     &apos;............      3.666,0003,684,000Less 20 per cent, unfit       ...... 737,000In Armed Forces :Army       ......... 1,430,000Navy        ......... 173.000R.A&quot;F.......... 243,000A.R.P. and A.F.S........... 100,000Deferments.........       ... 200,0002,947,000---      2,146,000Balance of 20-41 year olds        ...       ...... 801,000From the military point of view he thought the time had arrived when the public should be more fully informed as to themanner in which the man-power of the country was being employed.General agreement was expressed with this view.The War Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of home security, the Secretary of State for War, the Minister ofInformation and the Minister of Labour and NationalService, to consult together and make arrangementsthrough the Press for the public to be more fully informed of the use that was being made of man-power in thiscountry.Communist 2.   The   War   Cabinet  had  before  them  a  MemorandumPropaganda.      by the Home Secretary dealing with  Communist Propaganda(W.P. (G.) (40) 171).The Home Secretary said that a leaflet, recently issued by theCommunist Party and widely distributed, was clearly designedto discredit the Government and was calculated to foment oppositionto the successful prosecution of the war. He was satisfied that itsdistribution ought to be stopped. But the leaflet contained intabloid form the material which was published in the Daily Worker,and he had come to the conclusion that it would be both wrongand ineffective to suppress the leaflet without also taking action
Parliament. 3.   The War Cabinet accepted the recommendation made byM.P.s serving in the Secretary of State for War in his Memorandum (W.P. (G.) 40the Army.        1Q7) that the following rules should be adopted : (a) Leave to attend Parliament should continue to be grantedas freely as the exigencies of the Service permit.(6) Where a Member of Parliament is unwilling to continueserving on the understanding at (a), he shall be allowedto transfer to the Reserve, or otherwise be temporarilyreleased until further notice.Spain and portugal.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 191stConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto recent telegrams from Spain and Portugal, particularly Madridtelegram No. 463 and Lisbon telegram No. 355. The situation inthe peninsula was clearly becoming difficult, but Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;sfirm language to the Spanish Foreign Minister about the visitpaid by armed Germans to San Sebastian and Bilbao had producedsome effect.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Far East.Future policy.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 189thConclusions,Minute 12.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that sir Robert Craigie thought that the War Cabinefs proposed replyto the Japanese Government &apos;s demands would be regarded by theJapanese as tantamount to a refusal, since in his view the burma road question was the one point to which they attached importance.(Telegram No. 1149 from Tokyo.)The War Cabinet :-Invited the Foreign Secretary to bring this matter beforethe War Cabinet again on the following day.against the Daily Worker.   He proposed that an order should be.made prohibiting the printing, publication and distribution of this paper.A considerable measure of agreement was expressed with thisproposal. On the other hand, a number of Ministers thought thatit might well be unfortunate to suppress the Daily Worker at this juncture. They represented that there was some feeling of alarmin the country lest the Government intended to suppress anyexpression of free criticism, as had been done in France, withunfortunate results. In this connection, reference was made to several articles in The Times newspaper, which, it was suggested,represented an attempt by influential people in this country toprepare the country for the suppression of the Civil power and the handing over of the control of affairs to the Military authorities.The view was also expressed that there were a number of othernewspapers which were as worthy of drastic action as the daily worker.The War Cabinet decided : That the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum raised questionsof such importance that a decision should be postponed until a Meeting when the Prime Minister was present.
The UnitedStates ofAmerica.Navaldiscussions.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Washington telegram No. 1201, reporting that president roosevelt had agreed to technical naval discussions taking place inLondon.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The North Sea.Sinking at sight of unidentifiedvessels.(previous reference:W.M. 40) 87thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs reminded thePirst Lord of the Admiralty that some weeks previously theAdmiralty had pointed out that there was a large area in theEastern part of the North Sea in which no legitimate neutraltrading could possibly be taking place, and that there was every reason for sinking at sight unidentified vessels in those waters.He had said that he was in agreement with this policy, but hehad heard no more of the matter. In view of the threat of invasion,he hoped that the new instructions in this sense would be issued atonce.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he would look intothis matter and would communicate with the Foreign Secretary.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.France.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 192ndConclusions,Minute 5.)PrimeMinister&apos;sstatement.8. The War Cabinet were given particulars of the operationsundertaken on the previous day against French warships at Oran,and as to the present position at Alexandria.The discussion and the Conclusions reached are recorded inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Reference was made to the extent to which reports of theoperations at Oran had already been broadcast or had appeared in the Press. It was important that we should get in first withour account of the action.The Minister of Information said that an account of the action,presenting the British measures in a favourable light, had beentelegraphed to the United States press by Mr. Knickerbocker.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that bothM. Corbin, the former French Ambassador, and M. Cambon, theFrench Charge d&apos;Affaires, had called at the Foreign Office to protest against our action in regard to the French warships at Portsmouthand Plymouth. We must, of course, expect much sharper protestswhen the news of the operations at Oran were known.The Prime Minister indicated the main lines of the statement which he proposed to make in the House of Commons that afternoon.A suggestion that we might offer compensation to the dependants of French personnel who had become casualties inthe action off Oran was not approved, as being likely to be misinterpreted.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Royal Navy.Manning ofFrench ships.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 192ndConclusions,Minute 5.)9. The Chief of the Naval Staff raised the question of the manning of the French light craft now in British hands in our ports. Nearly all of the French sailors who had volunteered werejunior ratings, and in present circumstances might not prove veryreliable. It was therefore proposed to man these craft with Britishcrews under the White Ensign. At a later date a proportion ofreliable French ratings could be drafted into the crews, if circum-stances permitted.The War Cabinet approved this course.
Royal Air Force.training organisation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 132ndConclusions,Minute 13.)10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air, outlining the steps which had been takento speed up the training of pilots, to increase the output of training establishments, and to overhaul the training organisation (W.P. (40)238).The Secretary of State for Air said that a review of our long-term policy showed that we must now make the fullest use of aerodromes in the Dominions and Colonies. In particular, it was essential to resume shipments of aircraft for the Empire training scheme, which had been suspended when the fighting in Flandershad been at its peak. So far as possible, however, the needs of theEmpire Training Scheme would be met from purchases in north america. Such shipments would not, of course, be made to an extent which would weaken our position in the next few criticalmonths.The Secretary of State for Dominion A ffairs said that opinion in Canada very strongly supported the resumption of shipment.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the steps taken by the Secretaryof State for Air in regard to the training of pilots.(2) Approved the resumption of the shipment of aircraft forthe Empire Air Training Scheme, on the basis indicatedgenerally by the Secretary of State for Air at &quot;A.&quot;France. 11.   The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that theThe French Governor-General of the French Cameroons had given an assuranceCameroons. that he would stand by us.   He (the Secretary of State) attached(Previous the utmost importance to negotiations being started in West AfricaReference: with the Governor-General at the earliest possible moment. HeW.M. (40) 189th hoped that these negotiations would be followed by measures which conclusions, would enable us to assume some measure of control over the countryMinute 13.) ana over the French troops.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wasnot acquainted with the details of this problem, but he saw noobjection to the matter being explored with the Governor-Generalof the Cameroons.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies toarrange for negotiations to be started with the Governor-General of the French Cameroons, with a view to ascer-taining whether he was prepared to adhere to the french national Committee under General de Gaulle.The Secretary of State for the Colonies undertook to reportto the War Cabinet before any important decisions were taken as a result of these negotiations.Parliament.Facilities forM.P.s to inspectdefences.12. The Lord Privy Seal said that Mr. Shinwell had thefollowing Question down for answer that afternoon: &quot; To ask the Prime Minister, whether, in view of thedesire of honourable Members to satisfy themselves that our defence against invasion is adequate, and that our productionin arms and aircraft is being speeded up, he will afford anopportunity for honourable Members to inspect defences and factories at an early date.&quot;This Question was symptomatic of the feeling among a numberof Members of Parliament that, although they had a certainresponsibility for the defence of their constituents, they were not
sufficiently consulted or informed on Home Defence questions. Onthe previous afternoon he had been present at a meeting of protestattended by all the Welsh M.P.S.In discussion, the view was expressed that the desire amongM.P.s for information on defence matters was very strong, andthat it would be desirable to make some concession to meet it.One suggestion made was that instructions should be issued to local Commanders to give some information to Members ofParliament and to afford facilities for inspecting some, at any rate,of the defences in their constituencies.On the other hand, the view was expressed that it would be dangerous to take any step which implied that any Member ofParliament, as such, had a right to be given information in defence matters.Certain Members of Parliament thought that they werediscouraged from having anything to do with the Local defence volunteers. There was, of course, no bar against M.P.s serving in this branch of defence, and many of them were doing so.The Secretary of State for War undertook to ask GeneralPownall to take steps to remedy the position in this respect.The Home Secretary said that he had asked the Regional Com-missioners to make a point of keeping local Members of parliament in touch with their work.The view was expressed that prima facie there might be less objection to Members of Parliament being given special facilities to visit munition factories than to visit defences.The Prime Minister suggested that the reply to be given toMr. Shin well&apos;s Question should be on the following lines : &quot; The Government would always desire to treat Membersof the House with all possible consideration and courtesy, but no general right to inspect military defences, dockyards orsecret munition factories has ever been claimed by the house for its individual members, and I cannot think that any suchdeparture should be taken at this time.&quot;The War Cabinet Agreed that an answer should be given to Mr. ShinwelhsQuestion on the lines suggested by the Prime Minister.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 4, 1940.
