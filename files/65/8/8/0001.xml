France.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 195thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The War Cabinet were given the latest information inregard to the French Fleet.The discussion and conclusions reached are recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (40) 252) asking for authority to despatch a further telegram to the Governor of Nigeria,giving him authority to inform M. Brunot, the&apos; French Governor-General of the Cameroons, that in case of need he (the GovernorWM (40) 19Brd 0^ Nigeria) was authorised to say that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould collaborate fully in the effective maintenance of theadministration of the Mandate.France.The FrenchCameroons.(previous reference:Conclusions,Minute 11.)The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that it was clear from a telegram received from the Officer Administering theGovernment of Nigeria the previous morning (Annex III to his memorandum) that, if M. Brunot could be given a firm indication of our intentions to stand by him, it would have a most favourableeffect and should ensure that the Cameroons would stand by us inany trouble that might be coming. The Vansittart Committee were of the opinion that the previous telegram to the Governor of nigeria did not go far enough to meet the existing situation and recommended the despatch of a further telegram on the lines suggested. In effect, the telegram meant that we should keep theFrench flag flying and the Mandate in being, but would collaboratein the administration for the time being and thus prevent the disintegration of the territory. In answer to a question, theSecretary of State said that he was confident that the OfficerAdministering the Nigerian Government would carry out his instructions tactfully.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, speaking generally, the position in the French Colonies was not unfavourable to us; but he emphasised the vital need for taking effective actionin the French Cameroons which occupied a model position.The Prime Minister said that he was anxious not to give any impression, after the painful episode of the French Fleet, that wewere endeavouring to grab the French Colonies. It was important that the step contemplated should receive the right publicity.The Secretary of State for War said that he hoped the referenceto &quot; assumption of control &quot; in paragraph 4 of the draft telegramwould not be interpreted by the Officer Administering the Govern-ment of Nigeria as an indication that we were prepared to furnishany immediate military &quot;assistance.It was agreed that a cautionary phrase should be introduced into the draft in regard to military assistance.The War Cabinet :-Approved the despatch of the draft telegram contained in annex IV of the paper under discussion, subject to theaddition of a cautionary phrase in regard to military assistance.
France. 3.   Arising out of the preceding minute the War Cabinet hadCommunication a short discussion on the point, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;sacross North      Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Africanpossessions.France.Anglo-french relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 194thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theCharge d&apos;Affaires at the French Embassy, the Marquis Castellane,had informed his Department of the substance of a communication which he would be making formally in the course of the next day or two. This was that, having regard to the actions taken againstthe French Fleet, it was impossible for the French Government tocontinue unilateral diplomatic relations with the British Govern-ment. The French Government therefore proposed that the Charged&apos;Affaires should cease his functions, and transport facilities wouldbe asked for the Embassy staff.In discussion, it was generally agreed that if a communicationwas made on the above lines, the right course would be to send a reply asking for elucidation of a number of points. For example,we might ask what would be the position of Consular officers.Again it might be pointed out that the reason why we had had towithdraw our Ambassador was to prevent him being captured bythe Germans. We might say that we would be ready to appoint a charge d&apos;Affaires if suitable arrangements could be made.Reference might also be made to Colonial questions on which itwould be most desirable that we should have contact with the FrenchGovernment.The War Cabinet: Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toprepare a draft on the above lines.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 7, 1940.
