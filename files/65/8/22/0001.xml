141W.M. 210 (40).AircraftSupplies.Dominionrequirements.1. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary(W.P. (40) 279), covering a series of telegrams dealing with the shipment of aircraft to the Dominions.The following points were made in discussion : (i) The first telegram (BRINY 64 11/7) reported the resultsof a Meeting held in New York for the purpose ofco-ordinating Dominion and Indian requests for aircraft from the United States. The total requirements notifiedat the Meeting had amounted to over 2,000 aircraft ofvarious types.The second telegram (No. 15) contained further details of the Canadian requirements which formed partof this total.The remaining telegrams circulated dealt with a request from the United States Administration thatthe United Kingdom Government should justify taking over surplus engines from the French orders. Therewould be no difficulty in providing this justification,(ii) The only demands- for operational types dealt with inthese telegrams which had been acceded to came fromthe. Union of South Africa. South Africa was carryingout active operations in Kenya, and was thus in adifferent position from the other Dominions. TheSecretary of State for Air said that, after speaking tothe Minister of Aircraft Production, he had informedGeneral Smuts that we would make available to theUnion 24 Hurricanes over the next three months, and75 American Glenn Martin bombers between October1940 and February 1941.(iii) The Minister of Aircraft Production said that he had notconcurred in the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram toGeneral Smuts. In his view, the aircraft referred to inthat telegram (which had not been formally handed overto Air Ministry) came under his control and not under that of the Secretary of State. It was important not tointerfere unnecessarily with his Departmentspurchasing and shipping programmes.(iv) As   regards   the   Dominion   requirements  of   aircraftgenerally, these were very large. It seemed clear thatthey could not be accepted when account was taken of (a) The comparative immunity from attack which theDominions, in varying degrees, enjoyed.(b) The peril of invasion in which the United Kingdomnow stood.(c) The fact that the United Kingdom was the only base for air operations against Germany.(v) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thought thatit was essential that the Dominion Governments should see the picture clS EL whole. He pointed out, however,that the Canadian Government had already modifiedtheir programme in the light of our needs,(vi) The Prime Minister said that, while the Dominiondemands for aircraft would probably have to bedrastically scaled down, the Dominion requirements ofmunitions generally should be taken into account in thedemands which we should make to the United States, atthis juncture, when American industry was being turnedover to munitions production.[21560]b 2
The War Cabinet-(a) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs tosettle in consultation with the Prime Minister the termsof a telegram to the Dominion Governments, explaining that, having regard to the strategic situation, only asmall proportion of United States aircraft production could be made available to the Dominions.(b) Invited the Prime Minister to call a Meeting of the Defence(Supply) Committee for the purpose of reviewing thequestion whether the following aircraft produced in theUnited States could be made available to the Union ofSouth Africa : 24 Hurricanes over the next three months, and75   American   Glenn   Martin   bombers   betweenOctober 1940 and February 1941.(c) Recorded the view that aircraft produced or purchasedunder arrangements made by the Minister of aircraft production remained for all purposes under the controlof that Minister until they were formally transferredto the control of the Secretary of State for Air.Air Services. 2.   The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theThe Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (G.) (40) 191), the Postmaster-Transatlantic General (W.P. (G.) (40) 193) and the Minister of Aircraft Produc-Service. tion (W.P. (G.) (40) 196).(Previous Secretary of State for Air said that recently the Flyingreference: Boat Service to Egypt, India and Australia had been interrupted,W.M. (40) 94th andwas now being worked on a shorter route, starting from Durban,Conclusions,      which later would be connected with West Africa by an over-landMmute 8, and   ajr route via Khartum.  As soon as a Trans-African route had been.M. (40) 113th fur]y organised, it would be necessary to provide a strong civil airConclusions,      ^ink between West Africa and the United Kingdom, and two FlyingMmute l.)        Boats had been earmarked, but would not be required for this service until the end of September.  Meanwhile, it was proposed touse them on weekly flights to Canada and the United States to meetthe request of certain Departments for British air connection withNorth America.   In reply to a question by the Foreign Secretary,the Secretary of State for Air said that an alternative scheme to run a Transatlantic Service by American land planes would beenquired into by the Under-Secretary of State for Air, who was shortly leaving for America.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that he would likeall the capacity of these Transatlantic Flying Boats placed at thedisposal of his Ministry in order to transport across the Atlanticpilots and mechanics who would fly back to this country bombingaeroplanes which we had purchased in America. On the return journey aluminium tubes could be carried. An organisation was already in being to carry out this task.The Postmaster-General said that the postal arrangements withthe United States and Canada had deteriorated, and it now took&apos;o:y[ from 10 to 12 days for a letter to reach this country from New York.The pay load of these two flying boats was 2,000 lbs., and all he asked for was an allocation of 250 lbs. for urgent mail documents.The Prime Minister said that he had considered that thisquestion should come before the War Cabinet, as it involved thereversal of a previous War Cabinet decision.   The case for. reversalrested, he thought, not on the transport by air of passengers andi,J   - mails for a period of six weeks, but on the Minister of Aircraft
contraband control.Navalmeasuresoff theWest Coast ofEurope and north-WestAfrica.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 202ndConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (G.) (40) 189) in regard to Navalmeasures proposed to effect Contraband Control off the West coast of Europe and North-West Africa. In the course of discussion the following points were made :  (i) The Foreign Secretary said that he did not wish to makeany difficulty about the general policy of the First Lord&apos;sproposals provided regard was paid to one or two points.First he hoped that sufficient time would be given, before any announcement was made, to warn the Governmentsof the US.A., Spain and Portugal of what we intendedto do. Secondly, the scheme should be applied flexiblyin regard to Japanese ships, until we saw how theyreacted to the new policy. Thirdly, he doubted whether,if the announcement was made in 14 days&apos; time, it would allow sufficient time for bona fide shipping to get clearof the Zone.(ii) The Prime Minister said he had grave doubts about theFirst Lord&apos;s proposals. In his view they amounted toan adoption of the German policy of unlimitedsubmarine warfare, with the difference only that weshould execute the policy with humanity. The Navyheld the command of the sea and this should enable her to make prizes in the regular way according to Inter-national Law. The step suggested, if adopted, wouldmean that we were descending from a position whichhad been the turning point of great struggles in thepast and we should be conceding a great principle without gaining any real advantage.. Germany had endeavoured to gain command of the sea without paying the lawful price, which was a Fleet superior to that ofthe enemy. With command of the sea he did not seewhy it should be necessary for us to descend to Germanmethods, which we should certainly he accused of doingif the proposed policy was adopted.(iii) The Attorney-General, explaining the legal aspects of thenew policy, said that a claim to sink ships in a war zoneirrespective of circumstances could not be justified by international Law. For this reason the proposed announcement stated that ships without navicerts wouldProduction^ need to send pilots by air across the Atlantic in orderto pilot bombers back here. The fact that bombing planes werebeing flown from America here would make a great impression onthe Germans.The War Cabinet agreed  ;(i) That two long-range flying boats should be used to operatea weekly flying boat service to Canada and the UnitedStates this summer.(ii) That the needs of the Ministry of Aircraft production for space in these flying boats should have priority overthe needs of other Departments. Every endeavourshould, however, be made, subject to those needs, to allotspace to meet the requirements of the General Post Officeand the Ministry of Information.(iii) That the need for a strong civil air link between the UnitedKingdom and West Africa was urgent and that, subjectto war needs, the flying boats should be made availablefor this service when the necessary preparations werecomplete.
be liable to be seized and &apos;&apos; according to circumstances &apos;&apos;sent in or sunk. He thought that this announcement would have a deterrent effect, but was not contrary tothe recognised principles of International Law.(iv) The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that, owingto the shortage of naval vessels, it would not always bepossible to bring ships in as prizes, but, in any case,ships would only be sunk which had not complied withthe navicert regulations. The announcement of thepolicy proposed would, he considered, act as a deterrentand ships not complying with the navicert regulations would be few in number,(v) With reference to the Prime Minister&apos;s remarks, the FirstLord said that he did not agree that the policy envisagedwas comparable with German methods. He emphasised that it was not intended to use submarines for thispurpose. As pointed out in paragraph 2 of theAdmiralty paper, armed merchant cruisers and cruiserswould be employed. Ships would therefore only be sunkif circumstances made it impossible to send or bring them in, and in that event the crew would be taken off.(vi) The Minister of Economic Warfare said that Lord Lothianhad told us that the United States Government hopedthat we would make navicerts compulsory, and wouldtake steps to ensure that the scheme was effective.(vii) The Lord Privy Seal said that the proposed declaration would certainly be challenged, and he doubted whetherthe results achieved by sinking neutral ships would besufficient as to justify such an important change in our policy.(viii) The Secretary of State for Air said that he feared that,great as was the importance in this scheme of long-distance flying boats, it would not be possible to provide them in the numbers required.The War Cabinet (1) Agreed that a declaration should be made by the Ministerof Economic Warfare in the near future that ships&apos;navicerts should be made compulsory.(2) Agreed that the date on which the declaration should bemade should be left to be determined by the foreign secretary, the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the Minister of Economic Warfare, in consultation.(3) Agreed that the area described in paragraph 5 of the FirstLord&apos;s Paper should be declared a war zone, notificationbeing given to the State Department at Washington soas to enable them to increase their &apos;&apos; combat zone&apos;&apos; tocover the war zone.(4) Decided that for the time being the Royal Navy should adhere to their existing practice in regard to the seizure of ships within the war zone, and should not, for thepresent, adopt a policy of sinking neutral vessels. Theterms of the declaration of the war zone would need tobe modified accordingly.(5) Agreed that the decision in (4) should be further consideredif any new factors showed that it was necessary toauthorise the sinking of unnavicerted neutral vesselswithin the war zone.
Shipping.Proposals for control as an instrument ofeconomicwarfare.4. The War Cabinet had before them a joint Memorandumby the Ministers of Shipping and Economic Warfare on Controlof Shipping as an Instrument of Economic Warfare (W.P. (G.)(40) 188).The Minister of Shipping said that there might now be aconsiderable surplus of shipping in the world over and above thatthat could be fully occupied in trades of which we approved. he proposed, therefore, that, so far as possible, additional neutral shipping should be chartered and, if surplus to other requirements,used to bring supplies from more distant sources where no exchange difficulties existed. There would remain, however, a large block ofocean-going tonnage which might be used for purposes of which wedisapproved. Under the scheme set out in the Memorandum,various facilities would be given to shipowners who undertook notto engage in practices objectionable to His Majesty&apos;s Government.All other ships under neutral control would be actual or potentialblockade runners.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had noobjection to the scheme proposed, subject, if necessary, to somediscrimination being used in the application of the scheme to japanese ships in particular instances.The War Cabinet agreed (a) That, as far as possible, additional neutral tonnage shouldbe chartered and, if surplus to other requirements, usedto bring additional supplies from distant sources where no difficulties of exchange existed, and for other suitablepurposes.(b) That in future only those neutral ships whose ownersrefrained from objectionable practices should be entitledto British-controlled shipping facilities, on the same terms as British ships.(c) That an announcement of the measures proposed under (b)should be made at the same time as an announcement that navicerts were to be made compulsory (see minute 3).Enemy Export 5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theControl. Minister of Economic Warfare (W.P. (40) 282), proposing that the(Previous penalties for evading export control by carrying uncertificatedreference: cargoes should be the same as the penalties for evading contrabandW.M. (40) 202nd control by carrying unnavicerted cargo, namely, the liability of theConclusions,      ship concerned to seizure.&apos; ^ The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he didnot dissent from the steps proposed, but he hoped that a measure of flexibility would be attained in dealing with exports fromunoccupied France and from French North Africa. Apart fromthe political questions involved, we might, for instance, ourselveswish to import iron-ore from North Africa.The War Cabinet agreed that there was need for suchflexibility.The A attorney-General said that, if it was proposed that goodscoming from French Colonies should be treated as goods of enemy origin, the Courts might require proof that the colonies in question were under enemy control.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that the main objectof his Paper was to ensure that export control was on the same basis as contraband control. He agreed that discrimination shouldbe exercised in working the scheme.
The War Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Economic Warfare (i) To arrange for the issue of a new Reprisals Order inCouncil, permitting the seizure and condemnation ofgoods of enemy origin or ownership, and of any shipcarrying them from Europe,(ii) To include in the announcement to be made shortly on thesubject of compulsory navicerts a statement that the carriage of uncertificated cargo outward bound from europe would render the ship and cargo concerned liableto seizure.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 23, 1940.
