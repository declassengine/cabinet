Sic aJu* j?^uot f.u s so\$y -India. 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the(Previous Secretary of State for India covering telegrams exchanged withreference: the Viceroy (W.P. (40) 272), and a Memorandum by the PrimeW.M. (40) 201st Minister covering a telegram from the Viceroy (W.P. (40) 283).Conclusions&apos;, The War Cabinet first discussed certain questions of procedure.Minute 1.) A record of this discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;s StandardQuestion of File of War Cabinet Conclusions..&apos;^&apos;procedure.The draft The following points were made in discussion on the terms of5jg       statement.        the draft statement proposed by the Viceroy : (i) The Secretary of State for the Colonies drew attention tothe following passage in paragraph 7 of the draft statement proposed by the Viceroy : &quot; . . . . His Majesty&apos;s Government now authoriseme to say that they are quite prepared to agree to such arrangement, and to accept as body to frame, on theconclusion of the war, the main structure of theConstitution, any body on which the representatives ofthe principal elements in India&apos;s national life canmeantime themselves agree.....&quot;What were these &quot; principal elements in Indian life &quot; ?Did they include the Princes, the Sikhs and the Anglo-Indians? He thought it would be important that thispoint should be settled before any Statement was madeon the lines proposed,(ii) Exception was taken to the following phrase in para-graph 7 of the draft: &quot;It might be assumed that parliament would consider them in the most friendlyspirit and with the utmost anxiety to approve them asthey stood.&quot; It was quite impossible in the middle ofa great war to say what view Parliament or the country would take after the war on the subject of India&apos;sreform. It was undesirable, therefore, to use words which might be held to bind Parliament at that time.Dominion (iii) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs raised thestatus. question whether the status proposed to be conferred on india could properly, or with justice to the self-governing British Dominions, be described as&quot;Dominion Status.&quot; The classical and accepteddefinition of &apos;&apos; Dominion Status &apos;&apos; was that which hadbeen framed by the late Lord Balfour and accepted bythe Imperial Conference of 1926.It ran as follows : They are autonomous Communities within theBritish Empire, equal in status, in no waysubordinate one to another in any aspect of theirdomestic or external affairs, though united by acommon allegiance to the Crown, and freelyassociated as members of the British Commonwealthof Nations.To describe as &quot; dominion status &quot; a strictly limitedform of self-government which was certainly not of the9 &quot; Westminster &quot; variety might debase the currency andlead to complaint from the other Dominions.In any event, there was no question of Indiareaching &quot;dominion status&quot; in any real sense of the term &quot; within twelve months of cessation of hostilites.&quot;(iv) It was pointed out that the draft declaration was silent on social conditions in India.  Was it intended to leave, forexample, agricultural conditions and factory conditionsentirely in India&apos;s hands?[21562] b 2
On the more general issues involved, the Secretary of State forIndia called attention to paragraph 4 in the Viceroy&apos;s telegram ofthe 18th July (Enclosure II to W.P. (40) 272), in which it was stated that 1&quot; the absence of any reaffirmation of our intention would, I amcertain, be misunderstood, and possibly construed as a changeof policy.....My considered advice is that there should be some form of Statement or Declaration to accompany theannouncement of expansion.&quot;The draft statement now submitted by the Viceroy was less far-reaching than the Statement the Viceroy had previously submitted.He earnestly hoped that the War Cabinet would see their way to approve it. Broadly, he thought that there was nothing in theStatement which was not already covered by existing Declarationsof Policy. The fundamental point was whether, subject to certain matters for which we could not divest ourselves of responsibility,we should allow Indians to frame their own Constitution, if theycould come to agreement upon it. In the last analysis there were only two ways in which we could deal with India : (a) We could govern her from above and from outside.(b) We could allow her to govern herself at the risk ofoccasional misgovernment.The Prime Minister thought that we might go a long way towards a real understanding with India if we could return to theuse of plain and unambiguous language. We had been too muchaccustomed to hand the Indians lengthy documents full of high-sounding words such as &quot; Dominion Status &quot; and independence which were not always used in the same sense as they were byordinary people. Let us now say exactly what we meant and thusremove the suspicions of which we ourselves had in part been thecause.The Secretary of State for India and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs thought that, we could not get away from theuse of the term &quot; Dominion Status.&quot; It would be understood byall those concerned as marking out the lines which India&apos;s freenational life would follow in the future. For the moment&quot; Dominion Status,&quot; as applied to India, would connote somethingsubject to well-understood limitations, such as were not present inthe cases of Canada or Australia. In forty years&apos; time the positionwould, perhaps, be different. For the moment there was no possi-bility of misunderstanding or lack of candour. Indians were well aware of the reservations as to external affairs, defence, &amp;c.The question was raised whether it was the intention to conferupon India a status which permitted her to secede from the Empire.The Secretary of State for India said that there was no intention of conferring any such right upon India. The great mass of Indian opinion had before them the idea of self-government under the Crown. To. be exact, none of the British Dominionspossessed a de jure right of repudiating the Imperial Crown or ofseceding from the Empire. It was true that de facto nothing couldstop them from doing so if they wished. In the fullness of timeIndia might come to occupy a similar position, but this would notbe the case so long as we thought it right to reserve to ourself suchvital functions as defence and external affairs.Probable Discussion then turned on the probable reception of theIndian proposed Statement in India,reactions to proposed The Secretary of State for the Colonies thought that theStatement. proposed Statement might obtain the assent of neither Congress nor
yet of the Moslem League. If this happened, our position wouldbe worsened, and not bettered, by making it.The Lord Chancellor said that his mind would be powerfullyaffected by the consideration whether the proposed declaration would produce contentment in India until the-end of the war. if so, there would be much to be said for it, but he feared that thiswas unlikely. He recalled that the Congress Party had placedthemselves on record at the Ramgarh Conference as holding theview that Dominion Status was inapplicable to India. He also drew attention to a telegram, dated the 1st July, from the Viceroy(No. 1178) which analysed the political standpoint of the principalcommunities and parties in India. Judging from this analysis, hethought that the proposed Statement was more likely to arouse than to assuage controversy.The Secretary of State for India thought that the proposed statement would achieve its object, namely, acceptance by the greatmajority of moderate opinion in India.The position of Reference was also made to the position of the Princes.the Princes. Presumably it was still the intention to make the co-operation ofthe Princes a condition of Dominion status being conferred uponIndia. An India without the States would be a very incompleteentity. This question was bound up with the representation of the princes on the suggested constituent body. The undertaking in thedraft Statement was &quot; to accept asa body to frame, on the conclusionof the war, the main structure of the Constitution, any body onwhich the representatives of the principal elements in India&apos;national life can meantime themselves agree.&quot; There could be noquestion but that the Princes formed one of the principal elements in India&apos;s national life. The Congress Party, however, said thatthey would have nothing to do with the Princes except on the basisof adult suffrage.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded the WarCabinet that if we did nothing and allowed things to remain asthey were in those Provinces in which the Congress Ministers hadresigned, there was no delegation of authority in India and theCrown was governing direct. He doubted whether such a state ofaffairs could last very long. The question resolved itself into whether we should accept the advice of those Ministers (several of whom had a vast experience of Indian affairs) who favoured no furtherdeclaration; or Whether we should take the advice of the Viceroy,supported by all but one of the Provincial Governors, and make adeclaration. Apart from the passage relating to Parliament he doubted whether there was really anything of substance in theViceroy&apos;s draft Statement, to which we were not already committed.The Lord Privy Seal said that there was no difficulty in findingcriticisms which went to the root of any proposed form of constitu-tion for India. The real point was to get some constitution thatwould work in practice, theoretical imperfections notwithstanding.He was of opinion that some form of declaration was necessary,but had grave doubts as to the wisdom of leaving the drafting ofa constitution solely in the hands of the leaders in India. WhenIndia did govern herself, he thought that the immediate results would be a deterioration in the administration and the oppressionof the masses. He did not accept the Indian leaders at their face value. Our duty, in his view, was to ensure that India received a constitution in which the masses had a chance of taking someshare in the government.The Prime Minister thought it was important to recall the developments in Indian constitutional matters which had taken
place, and the various Declarations which had been made, endingwith the Statement made by the present Secretary of State for india on the 23rd May. In that Statement we had again said that the&quot; attainment by India of free and equal partnership in the BritishCommonwealth is the goal of our policy.&quot; The Statement nowproposed would involve an entirely new departure, namely, that weshould undertake in advance to accept a Constitution framed by indians. Further, the draft Statement proposed by the Viceroywent a long way towards pledging Parliament to ratify a Con-stitution framed in this way by Indians. The proposition that weshould accept any Constitution upon which Indians themselvescould agree went beyond the undertaking of Dominion status. Theproposal now put forward contained two elements of unreality :first, that the reservations on which we must insist cut at the rootof Dominion status as commonly understood; secondly, that it washard to believe that agreement on these matters among Indiansthemselves was possible.The Prime Minister thought that to make a Statement at thepresent time on the lines proposed by the Viceroy was full of danger.If we did, opinion in the United States might well take the line that, having gone so far, we had better give Indians all that they asked for and have done with it. Further, to make a great Con-stitutional Declaration in a country like India was likely to giverise to acute controversy. Such a course was wholly unjustified atthe present time.The Minister without Portfolio said that he rather shared theviews put forward by the Foreign Secretary. The point which mosttroubled him was to know how far the Viceroy felt strongly that aStatement on the lines he proposed was essential at the presenttime. If the Viceroy held this view very strongly, he would feeldifficulty in rejecting altogether the idea of making a Statement atthe present time.The Prime Minister said that the practical measures to beadopted had already been agreed by the War Cabinet, namely, theexpansion of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council and the establishmentof a War Advisory Committee. He agreed that these measures should be accompanied by a further Statement which, he thought,should follow the general lines of the Statement made by theSecretary of State for India on the 23rd May, should emphasise thatwe were making a further forward movement, should speakgenerously of India&apos;s war effort, and should invite the congress ministries to take up office in the Provinces again. As regardsConstitutional questions, the Statement might say that as soon asthe war was.over we were prepared to re-examine the basis of the1935 Act, so far as concerned the Central Government.Agreement was expressed with this suggestion and with theview that the Statement should include reference to re-examinationof the Constitutional position when hostilities ceased.The Lord President of the Council thought that it would bevery important to avoid language such as that contained inparagraph 8 of the Viceroy&apos;s Statement. This language referredto a period of twelve months after the end of the war, but was liableto more than one interpretation as to what was to happen in thisperiod of twelve months.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that something on the following lines should be included in theStatement.   We might say :  (a) Although we could not consider Constitutional reforms inthe middle of the war, we should be glad if Indians, in
4.15 95 (j(previous reference:W.M. (40) 201stConclusions,Minute 1.)the meantime, would consider Constitutional problemsamong themselves. &apos;(&amp;) We could not commit ourselves to accept the results of these discussions until we saw what emerged; but we wishedthem every success in their endeavours; and, should thoseendeavours fail, we should do our best to help when thetime came for us to renew consideration of Constitu-tional reforms.This suggestion met with general approval.The War Cabinet-(1) Reaffirmed their decision approving the expansion of theViceroy&apos;s Executive Council, and the setting up of aWar Advisory Committee.(2) Agreed that an announcement of these two measures shouldbe accompanied by a further Declaration.(3) Invited the Prime Minister to draft, for consideration bythe War Cabinet, a Declaration on the lines indicated by him in discussion, which should involve no departurein principle from the Declaration made on the 23rd May.Parliamentary 2.   The War Cabinet considered and approved replies to two questions.        Questions for answer in Parliament that afternoon dealing withthe following matters : &apos;(1) The publication of the total number of Naval and Air Forcecasualties.The War Cabinet agreed that the answer should state that publication would not be in the publicinterest.(2) The sinking by the Germans of the French ship Meknes,which had been taking some 1,300 French sailors backto unoccupied France.France.Plans forcertainFrenchMinisters.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 192ndConclusions,Minute 6.)France.french north african colonies.3. Reference was made to a telegram reporting M. Daladier&apos;swhereabouts and asking whether certain facilities could be afforded to him.The War Cabinet agreed that the First Lord of theAdmiralty should endeavour to afford the facilities askedfor in the telegram.4. The War Cabinet had a short discussion on the presentsituation in North Africa.A record of the discussion, and of the conclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 25, 1940.
