United States.Supply of destroyers andother munitions of war.Proposed Grantof base facilities in certainBritishTerritories.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 230thConclusions,Minute 8.)1. The War Cabinet had before them the following documents : Foreign Office Telegrams to Washington Nos. 1915 and1945.Washington Telegrams Nos. 1758, 1759 and 1760.Telegram No. 564 from the United Kingdom High Com-missioner in the Union of South Africa.Telegrams Nos. 1904, 1910, and an unnumbered telegram dated the 19th August from the United Kingdom High Com-missioner in Canada.Telegram No. 1831 to the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in Canada.Draft of telegram from the Prime Minister to Mr.Mackenzie King.The most important new feature in the situation was thatMr. Cordell Hull had now proposed an exchange of letters betweenthe United States Government and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in washington constituting a formal bargain whereby the BritishGovernment accepted certain naval and military material in fullcompensation for making available to the United States Naval and aircraft Bases in Newfoundland, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jamaica,Santa Lucia, Trinidad and British Guiana. The draft lettersproposed by Mr. Cordell Hull also included a definite statement that if the waters surrounding the British Isles became untenableto British ships of war, these would be sent to other parts of theEmpire for the continued defence of the Empire.Lord Lothian had proposed some drafting amendments whichwere an improvement. But it had previously been understood that president Roosevelt did not intend to establish any open connection between the measures which the two Governments were to take.The view of the War Cabinet was that a formal bargain on thelines proposed was out of the question.It was pointed out that no monetary relationship could beestablished between the benefits to be conferred by either side. from our point of view, the facilities which we were offering were worthfar more than the 50 old Destroyers and other war material whichwe were to receive, and whose chief value lay in our urgent need forthis type of vessel. If a formal bargain was concluded, it would beasked why we were not obtaining more valuable consideration; e.g.,cancellation of the American debt. Criticism of such a bargainmight well embitter relations between the two countries.The exchange of letters was, no doubt, proposed by the UnitedStates Government partly for reasons of American politics. We had also been informed that it was legally impossible for the president to part with destroyers without legislation, except in exchange fora definite consideration, unless it was certified that the destroyers were not essential for the defence of the United States.The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet that in his speech the previous day, he had announced that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had some months previously come to the conclusion thatthe interests of the United States and of the British Empire bothrequired that facilities should be placed at the disposal of the UnitedStates for the naval and air defence of the Western Hemisphere;and that we had now decided spontaneously, and without being asked or offered any inducement, to inform the Government of theUnited States that we were prepared to lease to them suitable sitesin our transatlantic possessions. There was no question of any transfer of sovereignty.The Prime Minister thought that our attitude in this matter,and that of the United States, should be that we were friends whowere each prepared to do what was possible to help the other to gain added security, without receiving any quid pro quo. Hethought that if we now made it plain that we would make available
6 VI &apos; to the United States the facilities which they required, withoutpayment, the United States Government would then find it possibleto send us the Destroyers. If the United States Government wishedto link the two transactions they could do so, but we should not doso.General agreement was expressed with this view.Attention was drawn to the wide terms used by Mr. CordellHull in regard to the proposed leases. The legal aspects of theseleases would need careful examination. The following points were referred to in this connection : (a) We should make it clear that what we were offering wasfacilities, and not bases; and that the sovereignty in the bases and adjoining territorial waters would remain inour hands. Any rights granted to the United states would not deprive us of our existing rights.(6) Difficulties might arise in regard to, e.g., Botwood andBermuda, where there was only one place suitable for an air base or a harbour. Such cases would have to be dealtwith by common user by ourselves and the United States.But again our own interests must be safeguarded.(c) It would be useful to examine precedents, e.g., Wei-hai-weiand Dar-es-salaam.(d) The line of approach proposed by the Prime Minister,whereby we spontaneously offered facilities to the UnitedStates without demanding any consideration, would strengthen our hands in dealing with these difficultpoints.It was thought that Mr. Mackenzie King was putting himselfinto a difficult position from the point of view of Canadian politics,and that he would find it difficult to obtain approval for the arrange-ment by which the United States Army would be granted facilitiesfor manoeuvres on Canadian soil. Tor this reason the Prime minister thought that he should introduce one or two cautionary phrasesin his telegram replying to Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s account of his conversation with President Roosevelt.The Prime Minister&apos;s speech on the previous day might increaseconfidence in the United States, and dispose the Administration toaccept less rigorous terms. It might therefore be as well to wait aday or so before replying to Mr. Cordell Hull. In the meantime,Lord Lothian should be informed, for his own guidance, of the WarCabinets views.The War Cabinet-. (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to informLord Lothian, for his own guidance (but not for com-munication to the United States Government), of the gist of the above discussion;(2) Invited the Prime Minister to prepare for their considera-tion the draft of a reply to the United States Govern-ment.ArmyExpansion.Use of the universities.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 213thConclusions,Minute 9.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (G.) (40) 221) to which was annexed a draft Press announcement giving details of a schemefor six months&apos; training at certain selected Universities to potentialofficers of the technical arms.The Secretary of State for War said that agreement had beenreached with the Vice-Chancellors and Principals of the universities. The scheme would provide 7 per cent, of the annualintake of Officers into the artillery, 37 per cent, into the SignalCorps, and 32 per cent, into the Royal Engineers. With referenceto the last paragraph but one of the draft announcement, it had now1 O       1. &apos;
been arranged that a number of young soldiers should be selected from the ranks, and sent to these courses at the Universities.Discussion followed on the statement in the Memorandum thatthe Vice-Chancellors and Principals of the Universities favouredcompulsion on University students to join the Training Corps,but thought that compulsion should be imposed by the Governmentand not by the University authorities. It was suggested that thispoint might be dealt with as part of the general question whetherthe 18 and 19 year old classes should be called up compulsorily.The War Cabinet (1) Approved the details of the scheme to give six months&apos;training at certain Universities to potential officers ofthe technical arms, as set out in the draft Press announce-ment appended to W.P. (G.) (40) 221.(2) Agreed that the question whether the 18 and 19 year oldclasses should be called up compulsorily should bediscussed by the War Cabinet, as soon as the Ministerof Labour and National Service was available to attend aMeeting.Foreign Affairs.Violation of swiss neutralityby british aircraft.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 230thConclusions,Minute 2.)Italy and greece.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported thathe had seen the Swiss Minister and had spoken to him on lines whichhad been agreed with the Secretary of State for Air. Briefly, hehad offered an apology for the violation which had taken place, but had added that weather conditions, &amp;c, made it impossible to make certain that our aircraft did not fly over Swiss territory.Reference was made to the tension between Italy and Greece.The Foreign Secretary said that his advisers were disposed tothink that, although Signor Mussolini was heating up the atmosphere, he was unlikely to declare war against Greece at thepresent time. This view was shared by the Turkish Minister forForeign Affairs. General Metaxas was taking a firm attitude, andthe Foreign Secretary did not think we could bring further pressure to bear on Greece to intensify her precautionary defence measures.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,August 21, 1940.
