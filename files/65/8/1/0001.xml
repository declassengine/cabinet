(40) 174thConclusions,Minute 13.)Choice of airobjectives.Inter-Serviceliaison.Digging up of open spaces.4.   A number of points were raised affecting Home Defence.First, would it be better that part of our Striking Force should now be directed to attacking enemy harbours rather thanmarshalling yards?The Chief of the Air Staff said that this matter was under examination by the Air Staff.Second, had complete liaison arrangements been made toensure speedy co-operation between the three Services in dealingwith attacks on this country? What, for example, were thearrangements for obtaining fighter support for destroyer unitsengaged in attacking enemy landings from seaward ? Had a schemebeen worked out in advance to determine so far as possible whatwould be the most important targets ?The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Admiralty and AirMinistry were reviewing the liaison arrangements in consultation.With regard to co-operation with the Army, the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, had the right to call upon 50 per cent, of the medium bomber force. Very complete liaison arrangements hadbeen made.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff added that completeliaison was maintained between the Army and Air Force at all levels, down to corps commands. He was satisfied that the arrange-ments were adequate.In the third place, the Prime Minister enquired whatimmediate action was being taken to dig trenches in big fields, inorder to prevent the landing of aircraft ? The fullest use should bemade of voluntary labour for this purpose.The War Cabinet were informed that the Home Executive hadbeen already instructed to deal with this matter as one of urgency,and to report progress that night.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.France. 5.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that GeneralFrench de Gaulle had addressed various bodies of French troops in thisvolunteers. country on the previous day and had appealed for volunteers.(Previous Twenty-two Officers and 1,000 men of the Foreign Legion had reference: volunteered, together with about 400 men from various miscellaneousW.M. (40) 185th units, and about 400 or 500 naval personnel. All these volunteersConclusions, were being accommodated in the White City. General de GaulleMinute 5.)        had wished the Senegalese troops to remain in this country.   TheWar Office, however, had felt considerable anxiety about these troops and they had now sailed.
24France. -   6.   The Secretary of State for Home Affairs and Minister ofPosition of Home Security informed the War Cabinet that by a reciprocalFrench citizens arrangement French citizens in this country enjoyed a position, forin the United purposes of taking up employment and for other purposes, veryKingdom. similar to that of British subjects.   They were thus in a positionof privilege, as compared with other non-enemy aliens. He hadbeen asked by the Foreign Secretary to revoke the order which con-ferred this position on French citizens. The result would be that,for example, French nationals now employed in Air-raid PrecautionServices, or in essential factories, would be removed from such employment. He would prefer to settle what categories of french people should continue to be given favourable treatment beforerevoking the order.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed to this plan,but suggested that the Home Secretary might in the meantime,without taking overt action, reopen the dossiers of a number ofFrench citizens who were unworthy of the privileges which they now enjoyed.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for the Home department and Minister of Home Security to consider this questionfurther, in consultation with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, and to submit recommendations.Evacuation ofChildren from great Britain.(PreviousReference7. The Prime Minister drew attention to the scheme forevacuating children to North America. Many people were nowexpecting the scheme to develop on a considerable scale. A largemovement of this kind encouraged a defeatist spirit, which was entirely contrary to the true facts of the position and should beW.M. (40) 175th sternly discouraged.(40)Conclusions,Minute 13.)In discussion, the following points were made :-(1) The official pronouncement on this subject, including the broadcast made by the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs on the 23rd June, hadstruck a cautious note. Nevertheless, public opinion had got out of hand. A Committee of Private Members ofthe House of Commons was encouraging the scheme,which now occupied a staff of 350 people.In discussion, it was pointed out that news had been receivedfrom several quarters of French personnel who were anxious tocontinue the struggle, but that the reception given to them hadoften been discouraging.The Prime Minister said that it was of the utmost importance that we should have a French contingent. Too often, however,the British authorities had appeared hesitant about welcomingFrench volunteers on the grounds of lack of equipment or other difficulties. This attitude was most unfortunate, and must not beallowed to continue.The War Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theService Ministers to issue instructions to Governors andCommanders-in-Chief to ensure that a discouragingattitude was not taken up towards French volunteers and that every effort was made to assist in building upa French contingent.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to consider further whether the French troops now leaving this country should be sent to Casablanca as at present proposed.
(2) Several Public Schools were now considering removal to north America. If facilities were afforded to the well-to-do, but not to others, to remove their children, a difficult situation might arise.(3) Rumour had been busy. There were even reports that theRoyal Princesses had gone to Canada, and that TheKing and Queen and the Government were preparing tofollow. It was of the first importance to scotch theserumours.(4) The evacuation of children was sometimes urged on theground that we ought to reduce the number of bouches-inutiles.   But the plan proposed would only reduce the        W*amount of food required in this country by a negligibleamount.(5) The practical difficulties were considerable. The amount ofshipping available was limited, and was required forother purposes, including the removal of internees.There was also the difficulty of providing naval escorts.(6) On the other hand, it was important not to offend opinion in Canada or the United States, which had been respon-sive to the idea.The War Cabinet decided as follows (i) The time had come to call a halt to this scheme and,without killing it, to ensure that it was kept to quitesmall proportions.   Thus : (a) The lists for the Government scheme should now be closed, on the ground that far more names hadbeen received than could be dealt with.(b) Steps should be taken firmly to discourage Schoolsfrom making arrangements to remove to north america.(c) It should be made known  that  only a limitedquantity of shipping could be made available forthe evacuation of children to North America.(ii) The Lord Privy Seal was invited to state the Governmentcase in the Debate in the House of Commons on Tuesday,the 2nd July, and to make use of the arguments brought out in discussion.(iii) The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should be responsible to the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security in regard to matters connected with the evacuation of children from thiscountry to Canada.(iv) The Prime Minister was invited to consider issuing a circular to Heads of Departments instructing them totake drastic steps to put a stop to defeatist talk.foreign information.Roumania.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 187thConclusions,Minute 5.) .Date of invasion of Great Britain.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs gave the WarCabinet the following information : Roumania: The position was very obscure. Our Minister atBelgrade reported having been informed by the Minister forForeign Affairs that Germany and Italy were anxious to isolate thequarrel (telegram No. 405 from Belgrade); but our Minister atBucharest reported in a contrary sense (telegram No. 614 fromBucharest).Telegrams had been received from Angora and from Bernereporting that the invasion of England was planned for a datebetween the 7th July and 10th July.
Syria,(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 187thConclusions,Minute 1.)Eire.Assistance inthe event ofGerman attack.(previous references:W.M. (40) 151stConclusions,Minute 13, andW.M. (40) 186thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Turkish Government had now agreed to our proposed declaration in regard to Syria.The War Cabinet took note of this information.9. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs on Assistance to eire in the event of German attack (W.P. (40) 228).In the discussion which ensued the following points weremade : (i) Eire, as a neutral State, was responsible for preservingher neutrality.    If she were invaded, we would beentitled to take action by the despatch of troops toprevent the violation of her neutrality,(ii) If Eire were invaded, it would be desirable that we should immediately take action,(iii) On the other hand, we must be careful not to be stampededinto taking action on a report of invasion Avhich waseither false or of insufficient importance (e.g., the landing of a few parachutists) to justify the despatchof troops into Eire.The War Cabinet agreed as follows :  (a) If the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, NorthernIreland, was satisfied that a serious invasion of Eire hadtaken place which called for the intervention of thetroops under his command, he was authorised to take action forthwith without obtaining Ministerialauthority from London.(6) If the General Officer Cornmanding-in-Chief, NorthernIreland, received information that Eire&apos;s neutrality hadbeen violated, but was uncertain (a) as to the authenticated-ticity of the information, or (&amp;) whether the situationjustified his intervention, he should refer to London for ministerial authority.(c) If the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, NorthernIreland, received a request for assistance, from the eire Government through the United Kingdom Repre-sentative in Dublin, he was authorised to accept it without reference to London.(d) The Secretary of State for War was invited to conveyinstructions in this sense to the General Officer.Commanding-in-Chief, Northern Ireland; and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs was invited toinform the United Kingdom Representative to Eireaccordingly.Iraq.Despatch oftroops.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 167thConclusions,Minute 14.)Iraq-P alestineroad.(previous reference;W.M. (40) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)10. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 230).The Secretary of State for India said that he was in favour ofthe despatch of troops to Iraq as proposed by the Chiefs of Staff,and that no difficulty would arise so far as the Government ofIndia were concerned. Following the despatch of the initialBrigade, the remainder of the Division could reach Iraq before september, always provided that the shipping was available. Ifnecessary, this Division could be later reinforced by two Brigadestowards the end of the year and a further six Brigades in the spring of 1941. Meanwhile, it was of the greatest importance that everything possible should be done to improve the road from iraq to Palestine.The Secretary of State for the Colonies considered that theearly introduction of military forces into Iraq was essential.
German propaganda had been very active and had made seriousinroads. He understood that the Minister of Information was taking steps to correct this, and he hoped that these counter-measures would be pressed forward.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed to the despatch of troops from India to Iraq, asproposed in the Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff(W.P. (40) 230), as soon as possible after His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Baghdad had made the necessaryapproach to the Iraq Government.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Information, to take all possible steps to counter the anti-British propaganda which was beingcarried out in Iraq.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for War, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,/to take action to improve the road from Iraq to Palestine, asa matter of urgency.Burma.   .constitutional questions.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 91stConclusions,Minute 12.)11. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Burma on Burma and the War(W.P. (G.) (40) 162).Some discussion ensued as to whether the Statement of policy could be made somewhat more positive. The view was expressed that it was reasonable that India should set the pace in this matter,and that the reply, as drafted in the Memorandum, should beaccepted for the time being as a statement of our policy in Burma.The War Cabinet Approved the proposed reply to the Government of Burmaas set out in Appendix VI to the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Burma.The Far East.Future policy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 187thConclusions,Minute 4.)12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs in regard to the policy to be&apos;pursued in the Far East (W.P. (40) 234). The Foreign Secretaryrecommended (a) rejection of the Japanese demand to close the Burma road;(b) an enquiry as to what was meant by the Japanese requestconcerning Hong Kong;(c) conditional acceptance of the request for withdrawal of the china garrison.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 330 from the Commonwealth of Australia suggesting that the Japanese demands did not themselves vitally affect thefuture or present security of the empire, and recommending that weshould be very careful to avoid any action which would cause Japan,to become involved in the war.The Foreign Secretary thought that, as an addition to theproposals set out in his Paper, in order to give some room for manoeuvre, a suggestion might be thrown out that we should be willing to agree that the traffic over the Burma Road should notexceed a certain figure-say, the level attained during the last twelve months. This suggestion might at least provide a point which would be a basis for discussion.In further discussion the following points were made : (1) The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, if the burma Road were closed,  there would be a sharpreaction among the Chinese population in Malaya, HongKong and elsewhere.
9 Q.France- .13.   The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he hadThe French received a telegram from the Acting Governor of Nigeria stating-Colonies: The that there was renewed and growing feeling in the French CameroonsCameroons. that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take over the administration(Previous of this mandated territory immediately, as otherwise the situationReference: would deteriorate very rapidly.W.M. (40) 184thConclusions,Minute 8.):Fl&apos;ench. The Secretary of State for India said that he had receivedpossessions in a similar telegram from the Government of India regarding the india- French possessions in India.   The French Governor had urged theimmediate recognition of General de Gaulle and the repudiationof the Bordeaux Government.(2) The view was expressed that it would be desirable to tryfor a comprehensive settlement of the whole Far eastern question, in conjunction with the United States ofAmerica. It was suggested that there might be somescope for making an offer to Japan on economic subjects.(3) On the other hand, it was pointed out that it would bedifficult to obtain a general settlement, the terms ofwhich would be acceptable both to the Japanese Govern-ment and to General Chiang-Kai-shek.(4) The Secretary of State for India was strongly opposed to making any offer to close the Burma Road, which wouldhave a lamentable effect in Burma and in India. Hethought that the chances of the United States coming in on our side would be largely determined by the willingness which we showed to fight our own battles.(5) The Lord President of the Council suggested that ouractions in the Far East were really governed by theposition in Europe. It was important to avoid getting into trouble with Japan at this moment, and we must therefore be prepared to keep things going.(6) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theAustralian reaction, as set out in Mr. Menzies&apos; telegram,was not unnatural, when one considered that Australiahad sent considerable armed forces to Europe. TheAustralian Government should be consulted before a reply was sent to the Japanese Government.The Prime Minister and the Lord Privy Seal expressed generalagreement with the line taken by the Foreign Secretary, and withthe draft telegram to Sir Robert Craigie, subject to an amendmentof the final paragraph handed round by the Foreign Secretary atthe Meeting.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved generally the proposals set out by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in his Memorandum, subjectto the addition of a suggestion that we might be preparedto consider some kind of rationing of the volume oftraffic on the Burma Road.(2) Agreed that the Governments of the Commonwealth ofAustralia and the Dominion of New Zealand should be consulted, and their views ascertained on the foreign secretary&apos;s suggestions.(3) Agreed that the matter should again be brought before theWar Cabinet in the light of the comments of the Govern-ments of Australia and New Zealand.
The War Cabinet Deferred for two or three days the question of what action should be taken in regard to the French Cameroons andFrench possessions in India.British north america Act.proposed amendment toenable theDominionGovernment todeal withunemploymentinsurance.14. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs raised, as amatter of urgency, a request received from the Canadian Govern-ment for the passage of legislation by Parliament here to amend theBritish North America Act. This legislation was required in orderto enable the Dominion Government to deal with unemploymentinsurance on the basis of a comprehensive Dominion-wide scheme.The matter was of great urgency in order that the necessary legislation could be passed before the end of the existing session ofthe Canadian Parliament.The War Cabinet approved this proposal in principle.France.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 188thConclusions,Minute 1.)15. The War Cabinet had a short discussion on this matter which was adjourned until a further Meeting to be held at 6 p.m.that evening.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.July 1, 1940.
