Enemy casualties were37 killed (wounded unknown); our casualties were 6 killed and12 wounded.Some 500 enemy were reported to have crossed the Sudanfrontier from Abyssinia.Navy: enemy The First Sea Lord said that the following ships had been sunkattacks on trade, by U-boat :  (a) The Greek S.S.

Japan.Arrest of Britishsubjects.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 217thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that therewas no marked change in Anglo-Japanese relations. On the3rd August he had received the Japanese Ambassador, who had,in the absence of instructions from his Government, called to expresshis grave personal concern at our arrests of Japanese subjects.The balance sheet of arrests was now as follows : British subjects arrested : -1 dead.7 still in custody.8 released.16 Total.Japanese subjects arrested (in different parts of theBritish Empire) :-10.The Foreign Secretary asked that he and the Home Secretary,acting in consultation, should be given discretion to release acertain number of the Japanese subjects now in custody. The aim should be to keep the position fluid. We might begin try releasingone Japanese who occupied an important commercial position inLondon. If the release of this man were the signal for furtherarrests of British subjects, we should arrest more Japanese.The War Cabinet-Gave discretion to theForeign Secretaryandthe HomeSecretary, acting in consultation, to release a certainnumber of the Japanese subjects who had been arrested.Operation 5.   The   War   Cabinet  had  before  them  a  Memorandum&quot; Scipio.&quot; circulated by direction of the Prime Minister (W.P. (40) 301) anda Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 304).A record of the discussion and of the conclusions reached is contained in the  Secretary&apos;s  Standard  File  of  War  cabinet conclusions.Prance. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFrench Colonies Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (40) 299) reporting thein West Africa,  position in West Africa.  A movement had been formed in supportof General de Gaulle, under M. Mauclere, Director of PublicWorks, who had asked whether we would support him.(previous reference:W.M.- (40) 196thConclusions,Minute 2.)The Secretary of State for the Colonies proposed that a reply should be sent on the lines that, while we thought it undesirable togive overt assistance to an attempt to throw over M. Brunot &apos;sGovernment, we would warmly welcome the establishment in the cameroons of an authority which would co-operate with us; andthat, if M. Mauclere established an effective administration by hisown efforts, we would gladly recognise it.The War Cabinet-Approved the despatch of a telegram to the Governor of nigeria on the lines of Annex &quot; B &quot; to the Secretary ofState&apos;s Memorandum.
France. 8.   The Prime Minister recalled that the War Cabinet had proposed Agree- approved the terms of a draft letter for him to send to Generalment with de Gaulle covering a draft agreement. Difficulty had arisen inGeneral de regard to two points. General de Gaulle had been anxious thatGaulle. the letter should include the  words  &quot; full restoration of  the(Previous independence and greatness of France.&quot;  Again, General de GaulleEeference: wanted a draft Article included specifying that his troops wouldW.M. (40) 204th not have to &quot; take up arms against France.&quot;Conclusions, From General de Gaulle&apos;s point of view, it was no doubtMinute 8.) natural that he should press for this wording. On the other hand,it was undesirable that we should agree to phrases the interpreta-tion of which might land us in difficulties. It was therefore proposedto accept the text proposed, but to safeguard the interpretation ofthese points by an exchange of letters. On the first point, it wouldbe stated that the phrase in question had no precise relation toterritorial frontiers. We had not been able to guarantee suchfrontiers in respect of any nation now acting with us, but, of course,we should do our best. On the second point, the phrase &quot;take uparms against France&quot; must be interpreted as meaning &quot;a Francefree to choose its course without any direct or indirect duress fromGermany.&quot;General de Gaulle was prepared to reply in a letter acceptingthese interpretations.The War Cabinet approved the course proposed.Air Ministry 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theand Ministry of Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of Aircraft production aircraft (W.P. (40) 300) setting out the heads of an agreement defining theProduction.       respective responsibilities of the two Departments.Division of q^he Prime Minister said that it was very satisfactory that anresponsibilities, agreement had been reached on this very technical and controversial(Previous matter.reference:W.M. (40) 210th The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that he would take an conclusions, early opportunity of discussing with the Minister of AircraftMinute 1.) &apos; Production the definition of responsibilities in regard to the supplyof aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of the agree-ment reached.France. 7.   The Prime  Minister  informed the War  Cabinet that french Overseas General de Gaulle proposed to form a &apos;&apos; Council of Defence &apos;&apos; ofPossessions. French Possessions beyond the seas, composed of those qualifiedauthorities in French territories which decided to join the general for the purpose of pursuing the war against our common enemies.He proposed to reply that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom approved the plan of forming this Council of Defence,and would be glad to discuss with it all questions involving itscollaboration with the British Empire, both in matters affecting thedefence of such French colonies against the common enemies, and inthose affecting the economic interests of those colonies.The War Cabinet-Approved the despatch by the Prime Minister to general de Gaulle of a letter in the terms proposed.
Home Defence.Function of thePolice and CivilDefenceServices.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 213thConclusions,Minute 10.)10. The War Cabinet again considered the orders to the policeif they should find themselves behind the enemy lines.The Home Secretary said that he had now had an opportunityof discussing the position with the Commissioner of Police of the metropolis and the Inspectors of Constabulary. The chief constables with whom the Inspectors had been in touch had allexpressed satisfaction with the instructions issued, which cleared up points which had previously been in doubt.Discussion followed on the wording of paragraph 4 (c) of theinstructions issued to the police in case of invasion. (these instructions laid it down that, if any elements of the civil popula-tion remained in an enemy occupied area, the rearguard of thepolice should also remain behind, and that the senior officer of thepolice should offer the assistance of the police in maintaining order,any arms previously not handed over to the military authoritiesbeing surrendered.) Objection was felt to the issue of an orderinstructing the police to put themselves under the order of theenemy and to give them assistance in any circumstances whatever.It was pointed out that these orders applied only to the rear-guard of the police, and that, if effective steps were to be taken toensure that the civil population &quot;stayed put &quot; and did not obstruct the roads, a proportion of the police must stay behind until theenemy occupation became effective. The instructions on this matter had been issued as a secret document, but had apparently got intohands for which they were not intended. It was most important to do nothing which might suggest the idea of retreat. There wasno room for retreat in these islands, and nothing short of themost vigorous and sustained resistance should be suggested orcountenanced in any instruction. This paragraph should, therefore,be amended so as to make it clear that the function of any policeleft behind should be to give all possible help to the civil population,without at the same time assisting the enemy.In discussion it was suggested that, as soon as invasion tookplace, the police should become part of the Armed Forces of theCrown. Various difficulties were pointed out. Thus many of thepolice were over the age of compulsory military service, or werephysically unfit and untrained to be soldiers. In any case, a civilian body could hardly be converted as a whole and automaticallyinto a combatant force. In actual practice the younger men trained in the use of arms would be withdrawn with their arms as far aspossible, leaving older and unarmed men behind. Means might,perhaps, be found of making this arrangement rather more explicit.Reference was also made to the position of members of the fire Brigade and A.R.P. Services. Many men had joined these services before the Home Guard had been formed and would nowlike to transfer to combatant duties. From the point of view of resisting invasion they should be encouraged to do so. On the otherhand, we had had no experience yet of heavy air attack, which would call for the services of able-bodied men in the Fire Brigade andA.R.P. squads. Probably the best solution would lie in somereciprocal arrangement between the Home Guard and the Air RaidPrecautions Services.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary,Secretary of State for War,of the Instructions to police the light of the discussion.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to of State for War in regard to of the Air Raid Precautionsfor combatant service in thein consultation with theto re-draft paragraph 4 (c)in the event of Invasion inconsult with the secretary the availability of members and Fire Brigade Servicesevent of Invasion.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,August 5, 1940.
