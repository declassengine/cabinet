Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 225thConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemy air activity.bomber command.Operations inNorthern Italy.Bombing Policy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 200thConclusions,Minute 1.)naval operations.1. The Chief of the Air Staff reported that enemy air raids on the previous day had been on a heavier scale than any yetexperienced. The raids had been on a front from Weymouth to the thames Estuary, and some of them had penetrated from 25 to30 miles inland.&apos; All had been intercepted and heavy losses inflicted on the enemy with few casualties to ourselves. The final figures forthe previous day&apos;s fighting had been : Militaryoperations.Somaliland.Our own.13 machines lost (10 pilots saved,of whom 2 had been wounded).enemy,y.78 destroyed (certain).33 probable.49 damaged.On the previous night a number of our machines had bombed the Fiat Aero Engine Factory at Turin and the Caproni AirframeFactory at Milan. The results of this raid were not yet available,but it was thought to have been satisfactory. All the machines had returned safely except one Whitley, which had landed in the seaat Lympne. The crew of this machine had been saved by a womanin a canoe.  This act was deserving of immediate recognition.The old acqueduct on the Dortmund-Ems canal had been bombedon the night of the 12th/13th August with, it was thought, satis-factory results.The Prime Minister referred to the 11 Blenheim Bomberswhich had been lost on the previous day in an attack, unescorted by fighters, on Aalborg Aerodrome. He thought that this raid rancounter to the directive in regard to bombing policy which had beenissued on the 11th July.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to furnish a report onthe matter for the information of the War Cabinet.The First Sea Lord said that two convoys had been attackedoff the East Coast by enemy aircraft, but no damage had resulted.There had been no attacks by U-boats on our trade.There was some indication that enemy aircraft intended tomake more use of torpedoes in future attacks on our shipping.Enemy bombers had carried out attacks on Malta, but had kepthigh when they discovered the presence of Hurricanes, and no damage was reported.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that a big battlehad been in progress during the previous two days in Somalilandon the main Tug Argan position. The attack had been strongly pressed, and had compelled us to evacuate Mill Hill with a loss oftwo 3-7-inch Howitzers. Our troops were everywhere resistingstubbornly, but were tired after two days&apos; fighting. The enemy losses were believed to be heavy.An enemy column moving along the coast road from Zeila toBerbera had been sighted by aircraft on reconnaissance, and hadbeen successfully attacked by Destroyers. Blenheim aircraft,operating from Aden, had given support to our land forces.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Home Defence. 2.   The Secretary of State for Air said that reports had beenReported received from the Police that 45 parachutes had been found,landings of apparently abandoned by enemy parachutists, in various districtsenemy in Scotland, Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Yorkshire.   In one caseparachutists.      a box, with maps and instructions, was said to have been found.Two parachutists were reported to have been captured, one in civilian clothing.The War Cabinet considered whether a reward should be offered for the apprehension of parachutists, but decided against this suggestion.   The widest publicity, however, Should be given to
the landings of enemy parachutists, if confirmed, so as to enlist the help of the civil population.The War Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary (a) if the reports were confirmed, to set on foot immediate action to ensure the apprehension of any enemyparachutists who had landed in this country.(b) to arrange with the Minister of Information for measures of publicity to enlist the aid of the civilpopulation.Australia.memorial service to ministers killed in air linerdisaster.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 225thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Prime Minister said that a Memorial Service to theAustralian Ministers killed in the air liner disaster would probablybe held on the 19th or 20th August, at 12-30 p.m., in westminster abbey. It would be appropriate that a number of Ministers,including one or more members of the War Cabinet, should attend the Service in person.When the time of the Service had been fixed, arrangements would be made by the War Cabinet Offices to ascertain which ministers would be able to attend the Service.Home Guard. 4.   The Secretary of State for War said that at present theProvision of Home Guard were being provided with denim overalls. SufficientUniform. quantities of this material were not available to provide uniform(Previous for the whole Force in the near future.   He therefore proposed to reference:        issue battle dress to those members of the Force who had not yetW.M. (40) 199th been provided with uniforms.   Sufficient quantities of battle dressConclusions,      were available for the purpose.  For the time being, the result would minute 2.)        be a mixture of uniforms, but this was preferable to allowing any considerable period to elapse before the issue of uniform to theHome Guard was completed.   The result of the step now proposedmight well be that ultimately the whole of the Home Guard wouldhave to be provided with battle dress.   Extra expenditure of about 1 million was involved, in regard to which he was in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The War Cabinet-Approved the Secretary of State for War&apos;s proposal,subject   to  consultation  with   the   Chancellor   of  theExchequer.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,August 14, 1940.
