Air Operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 226thConclusions,Minute 1.)bomber command.Operations inNorthern Italy.fighter command.On the same night, Hampdens had attacked the airframefactories at Dessau and Bernburg, causing severe damage.On the night of the 14th-15th August targets had been attacked in France, Belgium and Holland and good results had been obtained on an oil target near Bordeaux.The total casualties for the fighting over this country on theprevious day had been : Our Own. Enemy.8 machines lost (3 pilots saved).    30     destroyed,     8    probable,9 damaged.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Air Casualties.shipping losses.(previous reference:2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs invited attentionto telegram No. 1700 from Washington, in which Lord Lothian saidthat the claims made by ourselves and the Germans as to the numberof aircraft destroyed were so contradictory that there was a risk that it might be thought that both sides were telling lies. He askedW.M. (40) 197th whether steps could be taken to allow influential American Corres-conclusions, coorespondents to have first-hand access to the material on which ourMinute 5.)        reports were based.The Secretary of State for Air said that the intense air fighting which had taken place recently had made it impossible tocontinue to adhere to the practice whereby the destruction of aGerman aircraft was not treated as &quot; confirmed &quot; unless confirmed by a second pilot or the camera-gun. The present practice was to treat as destroyed an aircraft which the pilot concerned had seencrash to earth or into the sea, or break in pieces in the air, or godown in flames.One could not exclude the possibility that in isolated cases pilotsmight make mistakes, or that two pilots might claim the samemachine, although this la,st possibility was carefully tested byIntelligence Officers. On the other hand, our published figures of enemy aircraft destroyed were almost certainly under the mark,since they did not include (a) any aircraft which did not comply with the test given above(i.e., seen to crash on land or into the sea, or to break upin the air, or to go down in flames); or(b) aircraft known to be seriously damaged and probablyunable to get home.Again, no allowance was made for aircraft brought down by ourown pilots who failed to return.The Secretary of State for Air undertook to supply the ForeignOffice with a statement of our procedure.The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff said that American journalistswere visiting Fighter Headquarters that afternoon, and were being given the opportunity of hearing pilots examined by the IntelligenceOfficers as to their claims to have brought down aircraft. AmericanCorrespondents had also been allowed to visit Bomber Stations andto see our bombers fly off to Germany, and to have breakfast withthe pilots on their return.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the sametelegram (No. 1700) from Lord Lothian had referred to anaccusation that our figures of shipping losses were not accurate.The First Lord of the Admiralty explained that we kept a detailed account of all British and neutral shipping trading to theseshores, and that we were in a position to make the fullest check ofall shipping casualties. He undertook to supply particulars to theForeign Office.1. The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff reported that theoperations against targets in Northern Italy on the night of the13th-14th August had been very successful. Out of thirty-fivebombers despatched, thirty-two had found their targets.
The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to sendtelegrams to our Ambassador at Washington in regard to air Casualties and Shipping Losses, on the basis of infor-mation to be supplied by the Secretary of State for air and the First Lord of the Admiralty.Home Defence. 3.

Station &quot; announcing that the first contingent of German para-chutists had landed in this country, that the equipment foundincluded maps and written instructions, and that this announcementhad caused much anxiety in the districts concerned.
