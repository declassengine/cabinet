Air Operations. 1.   The Chief of the Air Staff said that the balance of losses(Previous during the two preceding days in air fighting over and around thisEef erence:        country had been as follows : W.M. (40) 207th Saturday, 20th July.Conclusions,Minute 1.)fighter command.German losses-lb certain.8 unconfirmed.3 shot down by our anti-aircraft fire.Maximum of 26British losses.- 6.Sunday, 21st July.German losses 4 certain.1 unconfirmed.Maximum of    5CoastalCommand.Enemy air action.E.A.F. training.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 193rdConclusions,Minute 10.)British losses: 2.A Sunderland which had carried out a reconnaissance ofTrondheim had failed to return. An enemy convoy of one large and five small vessels had been attacked near the Lister Light; and thelarge vessel, probably a Tanker, had been hit and set on fire. Photo-graphic reconnaissances had been made of Hamburg and Bremen.A good deal of mine laying had been reported. The principalenemy activity, however, had been concentrated against our shipping in the Channel and the Straits of Dover. A few isolated raids had penetrated inland. One of these raiders had shot down a Hectornear Old Sarum, but had later been shot down near Goodwood.The Secretary of State for Air said that increasing difficulty was now being experienced in conducting training in this country.Training in night flying had had to be severely limited. Everything-pointed to the training establishments being removed elsewhere.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.MilitaryOperations.The middle east.(previous reference:W.M.

(40) 172ndConclusions,Minute 11.)[21556]2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that therewas little of interest to report. Minor operations had taken placeon the Western frontier of Egypt and on the frontier of british somali land.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.3. The First Sea Lord said that Malta had been raided three times on the previous day.   Only slight damage had been done.The submarine Phoenix, which had been operating off Sicily,was 4 days overdue and must be considered lost.The Prime Minister drew attention to the vital importance of effective naval protection being afforded to the vessels which werebringing over consignments of rifles and field guns from the UnitedStates.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.b 2
Portugal and spain.German-Portugueserelations.The SpanishGovernment.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 205thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hiscolleagues would have seen recent telegrams from Tangier (Nos. 161and 162) reporting that Germany had delivered an ultimatum to portugal. The latest telegrams from Lisbon and Madrid, however,declared that this report was untrue.The Foreign Secretary added that he had recently seen membersof our embassies in Madrid and Lisbon, who were on visits to thiscountry. Both reported an improvement in the situation. It was now thought that the Spanish Government would resist, should theGermans attempt to force their way through Spain.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Japan.Suggested oil embargo.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Washington telegrams Nos. 1425 and 1637 ARFAR, dealing withthe possibility of the United States imposing an embargo on theexport of oil to all countries. The main difficulties inherent inthis policy were :  (i) That Japan might be stung into seizing the netherlands east Indies.(ii) That the oil supplies of this country might be prejudiced.His telegram to Washington (No. 1623) had attempted to bring out these and other difficulties inherent in this proposal. He had left it to Lord Lothian to settle how best to present the case.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Egypt.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 187thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that freshdifficulties had arisen between King Farouk, on the one hand, andSir Miles Lampson and the Egyptian Prime Minister, on the other,as a result of the appointment of Talaat as King Farouk&apos;s chef deCabinet. He had telegraphed to Sir Miles Lampson (Foreign office telegram to Cairo No. 666) saying that he might rely on the supportof His Majesty&apos;s Government if matters should go seriously wrong.It was, however, most undesirable that a political crisis should beallowed to develop in Egypt at the present juncture. Such a crisiscould scarcely fail to lead to the use of British troops for themaintenance of order. The enemy would naturally exploit the resulting confusion.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Portugal. 7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the ChiefsAtlantic Islands, of Staff (W.P. (40) 265).(Previous -A- record of the discussion on this Paper, and of the conclusionsReference: reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of war.M.

The Prime Minister suggested that the War Cabinet should(Previous give general approval to this Report.

These would require to be followed by further and more specific decisions, if and when there was any serious deterioration in our relations with France. At the present moment there appeared
(previous reference:conclusions minute 6.)Eire. 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (40) 274).The Secretary of State for the Dominions said that he had.M. (40) 208th received a.Report from Sir John Maffey to the effect that recently&apos;    r5 &apos;cini,s       relations with Eire had deteriorated.   This deterioration had been mainly due to (i) the suspicions in Eire that we proposed to invade thatcountry;(ii) our refusal to help them with the supply of munitions;(iii) articles in the press commenting on the folly of Eire&apos;sneutrality.In order to remedy the situation he proposed that a public declaration should be made to the effect that we had no intentionof sending our forces into Eire without a request from their government, and, also, that we should offer to the Eire government certain amount of military equipment. Such a declaration would,he thought, remove the suspicions in Eire that we intended to enter the country. Until these suspicions had arisen, our relations withEire had shown a great improvement, and their Government had made a number of concessions which some time ago would havebeen out of the question. For instance, they had turned a blind eyeto the infringement of neutrality by our naval vessels and aircraft;had agreed to the removal of cables to the United States, which now went from this country; and had taken part in Staff talks.If nothing were now done to remove the suspicions of Eireregarding our intentions, our relations would continue to deteriorate and they would be less willing to co-operate in future.The following points were made during the discussion :  (i) There was a great difference between a statement madeprivately and a public declaration. A public declara-tion on the lines suggested would be liable to bedifferently interpreted by the Irish and ourselves.Again, any statement which could be taken as implying that in no circumstances would we send our forces intoEire, except at that Governments invitation, would belacking in frankness, since circumstances might arise which would compel us to do so.(ii) To meet this point it was suggested that the declaration should be limited to a declaration of our presentintentions; and that if, for example, Mr. de Valera didnot carry out his declared intention of defending Eireagainst the German invasion, it would be open for usto deal with that new situation on its merits.(iii) We had originally proposed to supply military equipment to Eire as part of the comprehensive plan which theyhad rejected. There was a risk that, if we suppliedarms, they might be captured by the Germans or used by the Irish against ourselves. Further, the with-holding of arms might well be the most effective wayof bringing the Eire Government to a greater realisation of their dangers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 195thConclusions,Minute 11.)to be a fair prospect tbat those relations would stabilise themselves,or possibly show a slight improvement. It was important that theChiefs of Staff should keep the matters dealt with in their report under constant review.The War Cabinet Gave general approval to the recommendations containedin W.P. (40) 256.
(iv) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, from.the military point of view, he regarded Eire as a potential ally and believed that&apos; they would fight ifinvaded by Germany. It was in our interest to help them to do so.(v) It had been suggested that the Government of Eire wouldprobably accept instructors with any anti-aircraft gunswhich we supplied to them. If they did, this materiallyaltered the situation, since this would represent anextension of co-operation in defence.(vi) Even so, there could be no question of sending equipmentat this stage on the scale proposed as part of the plan which the Eire Government had rejected.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that action should be taken to damp down the press campaing.(2) Decided that a public statement on the lines proposed should not be made.(3) Invited the War Office to prepare, for consideration bythe War Cabinet, a list of equipment which might besupplied to the Eire Government at this juncture, ona more limited scale than previously proposed.Home Defence 10.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by(Security) the Lord President of the Council (W.P. (40) 271)-Executive. (a) dealing with the scope of the Home Defence (Security)Special Executive, and operations (b) proposing  the  establishment  of  a  Special  OperationsExecutive. Executive.The Lord President of the Council proposed that in para-graph 4 (i), for the words &quot; in Germany or areas occupied by her,&quot;should be substituted &quot; in enemy or enemy-occupied territories, orother areas.&quot;This was agreed to.The Lord Privy Seal mentioned that there was a Question for answer on the following day, asking whether the Committee underthe Chairmanship of Lord Swinton was still in existence, who its members were, and whether it was making any reports. The WarCabinet took the view that it was undesirable that Lord Swinton&apos;sCommittee should be the subject of a Parliamentary Question. as this Question had appeared on the Order Paper, the best coursewould be to reply that it was not in the public interest to give any information on this subject. It would be very undesirable that any Questions in regard to the Special Operations Executiveshould appear on the Order Paper.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals in the Memorandum by the lord president of the Council (W.P. (40) 271), subject to theverbal amendment referred to in discussion.Germany.Possibility of a&quot; peace offensive.&quot;11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (40) 270),covering copies of a telegram to the four Dominion Governments,and of General Smuts&apos; reply.The Prime Minister said that General Smuts&apos; telegram, whichhad, of course, been despatched before it had been announced that hitler would speak in the Reichstag on Friday the 19th July,
defence regulation 18 B.Custody ofpersonsdetained.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 133rdConclusions,Minute 10.)12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary dealing with the question whether it would bedesirable to transfer overseas 600 members of the British Union ofFascists who had been detained under Defence Regulation 18b(W.P. (40) 273). The Home Secretary said that it was very doubtfulwhether there was any suitable place in the Colonies to which these people could be sent. Before any persons detained under theDefence Regulations could be sent to a self-governing Dominion,amending legislation would be necessary. He thought that such legislation would be controversial.In discussion, the view was expressed that all the accommpda-tion which could be made available in the Dominions or colonies would be required for interned aliens, for prisoners of war, or forspecial classes, e.g., the Gibraltarians who had been evacuated from gibraltar. In these circumstances there was much to be said for keeping the 600 members of the British Union of Fascists in thiscountry, under suitable conditions.The War Cabinet-Decided not to proceed further at the present time withthe suggestion to transfer overseas the members of theBritish Union of Fascists who had been detained under defence Regulation 18b.showed great prevision in suggesting that Hitler was likely to start a peace offensive at an early date.The War Cabinet took note of these telegrams.Discussion then ensued on a suggestion that Resolutions shouldbe put down for debate in both Houses on the following Thursday,expressing the resolve of this country to fight on until nazism hadbeen defeated. These Resolutions might be proposed and secondedby Private Members in the Commons, and by Peers who held no government post in the Lords. After a short and rather formalQ Debate a free vote should be allowed.In favour of this course it was argued that it would be undesirable that the occasion of Herr Hitler&apos;s speech should beallowed to pass without any notice being taken of it. The procedure of Resolutions in both Houses would show the strength of ourinstitutions, and would serve to associate the whole country withthe Governments determination and resolve.Against this, it was said that public morale in the country was so good that no formal expression of it was necessary at the presenttime. The procedure of Resolutions in both Houses was not onewhich could be used frequently and there was much to be said for keeping it for some later occasion.The view was also expressed that Herr Hitler&apos;s speech was intended for home consumption. It did not contain any specificoffer, the rejection of which would call for immediate action onHitler&apos;s part, but made an appeal which did not call for any definitereply.The War Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to discuss this suggestion withthe Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury.
Aliens.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 207thConclusions,Minute 12.)13. The War Cabinet had before them a revised Memorandumon the subject of Aliens by the Lord Privy Seal, embodying theresults of the discussion in the War Cabinet on the 17th and the18th July (W.P. (G.) (40) 195).The Secretary of State for War asked that the first sentence in paragraph D on page 2 should be amended to read as follows : &apos;&apos; Those of military service who should be so far as possibleeither in their own national forces or in a Foreign Legion.&quot;Subject to this amendment the War Cabinet approved theReport.The War Cabinet were informed that there were a numberof questions dealing with the treatment of aliens for answer in theHouse of Commons on the following day. It was agreed that theSecretary of State for the Home Department and Minister of home security should arrange to make a statement at the end of questions on the lines of the recommendation in the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s paper.This statement would include an announcement of the appointmentof the two Advisory Committees.The Lord Privy Seal said that he thought that the enquiryreferred to at the Meeting of the War Cabinet held on the 18th July(W.M. (40) 207th Conclusions, Minute 12 (iv)) should be extendedto cover selection of aliens for internment at Huyton Camp. Thiswas agreed to.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations in the Memorandum by theLord Privy Seal (W.P. (G.) (40) 195).(2) Agreed that an announcement in regard to these recom-mendations should be made by the Home Secretary onthe following day.(3) Agreed that the Conclusion to Minute 12 (iv) of the Meetingheld on the 15th July should be amended to read asfollows: &quot; Inquiry should be made as to the selection of aliens for deportation on the Arandora Star andas to the selection of aliens for internment inHuyton Camp.&quot;Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 22, 1940.
