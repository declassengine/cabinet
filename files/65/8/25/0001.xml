(40) 209thConclusions,Minute 1.)Quality ofGermanpilots.Bombsfailing toexplode.2. The Secretary of State for Air gave an account of the air operations in the preceding 24 hours.On the night of the 25th-26th July, 172 bombing sorties hadbeen made.  Our losses amounted to 7 aircraft.In connection with the enemy attacks on shipping in theChannel (See Minute 3) a major air engagement had taken placeoff Dover. Reports indicated that 26 enemy aircraft had beenbrought down for certain, and 14 unconfirmed. We had lost 6fighters.Successful air operations had been carried out in the middle east.In reply to a question, the Secretary of State doubted whetherevidence would support the view that there was a marked deterioration-tion in the quality of German pilots. He would enquire further into this.An analysis was being made of the cases in which our bombsfailed to explode. Difficulty had been experienced in the past with one particular type of bomb. Other factors to be taken into accountwere : (a) the very delicate character of our fuzes, which requireddifferent settings for different targets : (b) the human factor. Aman numbed with cold found it difficult to set the fuze correctly.The Germans were experiencing the same difficulty. A casein Scotland was mentioned, where 150 incendiary bombs had allfailed to explode.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.naval operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 209thConclusions,Minute 3.)Attack on theSouth CoastConvoy.Mine-laying:St. George&apos;s channel.3. The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff said that the attack on theSouth Coast Convoy off Dover the previous day had been the mostserious attack yet experienced. The South Coast Convoy consistedmainly of small colliers and sailed once a week. The convoy hadbeen repeatedly attacked by waves of bombers approaching fromthe Calais area. Of the 19 ships in the convoy, 5 had been sunk and5 damaged. The attack by aircraft had been followed up by anattack by 9 enemy E-boats. H.M. Destroyers Boreas and Brillianthad driven off the E-boats. The destroyers had gone almost to theFrench shore, and had themselves been heavily bombed. Boreas hadbeen severely damaged and had been towed into Dover. She had15 killed and 29 wounded. Brilliant had been hit aft, but had no casualties. The question of this convoy was being enquired into that morning.We had now begun to lay the new mine-field between theCornish coast and Southern Ireland.Enemy mine- In reply to a question, the Vice-Chief of Naval Staff said thatlaying. there had been a considerable increase in mine-laying by enemy aircraft. This was not, however, causing us any serious embarrass-ment. The ports and channels mentioned in the daily reports asbeing closed by mine-laying were in most cases opened again after a few hours, when sweeping had taken place. No port had been kept closed for any considerable period.[21567] b 2
Destroyersfrom theUnitedStates.(previous reference:The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff said that the Prime minister had received a telegram from Lord Lothian (Washington telegramNo. 1492), inquiring whether, if it were possible to get them, HisMajesty&apos;s Government would like the use of, say, 50 or 100 Americandestroyers, and a number of American seaplanes. The PrimeMinister was sending a reply pointing out our urgent need of this.M.

(40) 203rdConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams : Telegram No. 318 to Moscow gave Sir Stafford Cripps theline he should follow in an interview with M. Stalin. He shouldpoint out the difficulties of modifying the Montreux Con-vention, and should suggest that the most likely solution lay inthe Soviet and Turkish Governments, in conjunction perhapswith His Majesty&apos;s Government, recognising that they hada common interest in protecting the security of the Straits.Angora telegram No. 849 showed that Sir HugheKnatchbull-Hugessen had been thinking on much the same lines.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.France.Anglo-french relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 205thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Foreign Secretary recalled that the French Govern-ment had said that before they could resume bilateral diplomatic representation they required to see five conditions fulfilled. several of these conditions were unacceptable to us.He had since told the French Government the name of the officerwhom we wished to appoint as our Agent at Vichy. The french had answered that they could not receive our representative unless we sent back the French officers whom we were detaining in thiscountry, to the number of about 50, and undertook to cease droppingleaflets over France.He would like a little time for reflection before recommending a course of action to the War Cabinet. His first reaction was thatit might be worth while making concessions of the kind suggested,in order to secure a continuance of diplomatic relations with France.But we could expect little from the present French Government.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Roumania. 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that M. Tilea, the RoumanianDiplomatic Minister in London, was being recalled. The Roumanian Govern-Repre-   - ment wished to appoint in his place a diplomat with strong anti-sentatives.        British sympathies. This would require careful handling, if normaldiplomatic   relations  between   the   two   countries   were  to  be     (1)&apos;maintained.   One way out of the difficulty would be that each country should be represented in the other&apos;s capital by a Charged&apos;Affaires.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
The,Allies.Organisationof allied naval, armyand aii-contingents.7. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff (W.P. (40) 281) on the organisation of the contingents nowmaintained in this country by exiled Governments and other friendly authorities of the following nationalities : French,Poles,Dutch,Czechs,Norwegians,Belgians,Anti-Nazi Germans.In discussion the following points were made : (i) Three new fighter squadrons had been formed in thepreceding week, 2 Polish and 1 Czech.   The pilots were very promising and keen.   The squadrons were equipped with Hurricanes.(ii) The Home Secretary drew attention to certain disorderswhich had taken place among the Czech troops stationed in Cheshire, as a result of which the British civil authorities had been compelled to isolate 250 men. Itwas most unfortunate that the civil power should haveto intervene in such cases. The remedy was to confer onthe Allied Authorities power to discipline their owntroops.The War Cabinet-(i) Took  note   of  the Report   by   the   Chiefs   of   Staff(W.P. (40) 281).(ii) Invited the Home Secretary to consult with the service ministers and the Law Officers of the Crown with a viewto sufficient jurisdiction being conferred on the AlliedAuthorities in this country to enable them to exercisedisciplinary control over their own troops.BombardmentPolicy.Objectives inoccupiedFrance.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 207thConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air in regard to Bombardment Policy in occupied France (W.P. (40) 284).The Secretary of State for Air, after explaining his proposals,said that care would be exercised before, say, barracks were bombedto ascertain that they were occupied by Germans.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, subjectto due care, he did not raise objection to either of the two alterna-tives suggested by the Secretary of State for Air.The bombing of trains was referred to, and the Chief of theAir Staff suggested that it would be safe to assume that any trainsat night would be carrying Germans and not French passengers.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that itwould be wise to obtain information on this subject before startingto bomb trains in occupied France. He undertook to make enquiries.Further discussion connected with this subject is contained inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet Agreed that, subject to the point raised by the foreign secretary in regard to trains, the Royal Air Force shouldbe authorised to bomb any military objectives in occupiedFrance, as defined in paragraph 4 of the Revised Instruc-tions, dated the 31st May, 1940 (annexed to W.P. (40) 186),modified in respect of shipping as indicated in para-graph 1 of the Secretary of State for Air&apos;s Memorandum(W.P. (40) 284).
ArmyExpansion.Use of publis schools and universities.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 185thConclusions,Minute 16.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the lord president of the Council (W.P. (G.) (40) 198) covering a Memo-randum by the Secretary of State for War. The following werethe main points made in the course of the discussion : (i) The Lord President of the Council said that he had receiveda letter from the Chairman of the University GrantsCommittee drawing attention to three points : (a) The importance of not ignoring humanistic subjects in the six months&apos; courses. It would be a gravemistake if the universities of this country wereto become centres of scientific and technicalinstruction only.(b) Nervousness was expressed regarding the use of compulsion for university students to join thetraining corps, and the hope was expressed that,before a decision was taken on this point, the Vice-Chancellors and Principals should be consulted.(c) A number of men and women students were in some doubt whether they should enter on, or continue,their university studies. The Government should announce that studies should be continued.(ii) The Secretary of State for War said that the universityauthorities had been consulted throughout in regard tothe proposed arrangements, and had expressed agree-ment. In any case the proposals in his Memorandumwere to be discussed at a meeting with the Vice-Chancellors and Principals of universities. Althoughthe proposals would involve the occupation of a large part of the university accommodation, there would be some room left for other educational purposes. TheSecretary of State for War added that, the officer position was becoming serious, and the standard of officers nowpassing through the various courses was not as high asit should be.(iii) Reference was made to the importance of recruitingofficers from young men who had a background of professional military knowledge. It was not sufficientto promote men from the ranks simply because of their efficiency in a unit. Schools from all over the country should be encouraged to send their most promising pupilsto go through specially arranged courses in militarysubjects. Officers drawn from these courses wouldpossess the real knowledge which qualified them to beleaders of platoons and companies.(iv) It was suggested the best men were not always recom-mended by units for Commissions, and that men withtechnical qualifications were sometimes held back onaccount of their usefulness to their units.(v) Attention was also drawn to the importance of developing the educational facilities in the Army, especially duringthe winter months. The Secretary of State for War saidthat this question had already received the attention ofthe Army Council, and active steps were being takento bring up to date and extend Army educationalfacilities.The War Cabinet approved the recommendations made bythe Secretary of State for War, subject to : (i) further discussion of points (a) and (b) raised by theLord President, at the meeting to be held with the vice--Chancellor and Principals of the universities :(ii) satisfactory   arrangements   being   made   with   theChancellor of the Exchequer in regard to the financing of the proposals.
37-iL/    VHomeDefence.Function ofthe civilpopulation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 199thConclusions,Minute 2.)10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (W.P. (G.) (40) 197) submitting a revised draftpamphlet, relating to the duties of the civil population in the eventof invasion. Some discussion took place regarding the orders to thePolice in the event of invasion. In particular, doubt was expressedin regard to the order that, in the event of the Police finding them-selves behind the enemy lines, they should surrender their armsand confine their duties to looking after the interests of the civilpopulation. While this was a confidential order, its existence had become known in very misleading forms. It was suggested that itwould be preferable if the Police were instructed in this contingencyto act at their own discretion, and not, in any event, to affordassistance to the invader. The opinion was expressed that in no circumstances should the Police be responsible for keeping order inan area which had been overrun by the enemy; such a task shouldbe performed by the enemy. It was also suggested that, wheninvasion occurred, the Police should have military status conferred on them.The Home Secretary said that the orders for the Police in caseof invasion were based on a doctrine that had been laid down formany years, and there were a number of contingencies to be takeninto account before any amendment to them could be carried out.He agreed, however, that an enquiry into the regulations wouldbe desirable.The War Cabinet (i) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to confer with the HomeSecretary with a view to considering the desirabilityof amending instructions to the Police in the event of invasion.(ii) Approved the revised draft leaflet subject to the following amendments :  (a) In the paragraph entitled : &apos;&apos; What Will happen to Me If I Do Not Stay Put,&quot; the official Germanmessage mentioned should be referred to&quot;captured&quot; message.(b) The paragraph entitled : &quot; How can I help,&quot; should read as follows : &quot; By setting a good example to others. Civilians who try to join in the fight are more likely to obstruct than to assist. The defeat of an enemy attack is the task of the armed forces which include the Home Guard, so if you wish tofight, first enrol in the Home Guard and if thereis no vacancy for you at the moment register yourname for enrolment and you will be called upon as soon as the army is ready to employ you. for those who cannot join, &amp;c.&quot; as in the draftleaflet.Eire.Supply of equipment.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 209thConclusions,Minute 9.)11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (40) 285), to which was annexeda list of the equipment which it was suggested might be supplied to the Government of Eire at this juncture.The following points were made in discussion : (1) The supply of this equipment must be considered from themilitary point of view; namely, whether it would be more to our advantage to supply particular articles of equip-ment to Eire in order to induce better co-operationbetween the Eire forces and our troops in resisting aGerman invasion of Ireland, than to supply the samearticles to our own units.
(2) There was some advantage in supplying Bren-carriers,since there would be a good case for sending men withthem as instructors.(3) The supply of searchlights must be further consideredhaving regard inter alia to the need of Belfast for search-lights.(4) It was suggested that the supply of a certain number ofsteel helmets wo, A have a useful psychological effect.(5) There was clearly some risk in supplying equipment to eire, and it might well be argued that the best way to induce Eire&apos;s co-operation was to withhold all suppliesof equipment. Nevertheless the general view of the WarCabinet was that it was right to take the risk involved.The War Cabinet Authorised the Secretary of State for War to supplyequipment to Eire within the limits of the proposals setout in his Memorandum; which proposals should, generallyspeaking, be regarded as a maximum.Propaganda. 12.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFuture policy. Minister of Information (W.P. (40) 275) pointing out that, whilethe morale of the people of this country was very high at the moment,the present mood might not endure indefinitely. Should such achange come, it would be important that we should be in a positionto convey a clear and definite picture of the cause which was at stake.The Minister, of Information said that, since writing his Paper,General Smuts&apos; telegram No. 547, of the 17th July, 1940, had beenreceived. This telegram suggested that a &quot; Brains Trust&quot; shouldbe set going, to work out an alternative democratic plan forcountering a peace movement which was certain to come sooner or later. Mr. Wickham Steed had also sent him a Memorandum with proposals for a Propaganda Council of four or five people. Hesuggested that the Council, which should include two Ministers,should study the general lines that our propaganda should take.In discussion, general agreement was expressed with theMinister&apos;s Paper, but the matter was thought to require furtherconsideration.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded the WarCabinet that, at the outset of the war, we had taken the view that,if only Germany would get rid of Hitlerism, there was no reason why Germany should not take her place in a new and better Europe.Later, however, on the insistence of the French, we had ratherdropped this line. He thought it was important that we should return to it.The Prime Minister sketched out certain ideas which mightwell take their place in any scheme for the reconstitution of Europe.He thought that the matter required further study by various groups of Ministers.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Information to submit to the WarCabinet a scheme for the further examination of the ideasoutlined in his Paper.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 26, 1940.
