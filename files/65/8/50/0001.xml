(40) 234th ment measures.Conclusions,Minute l.) The War Cabinet had also before them a Memorandum bythe Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Shipping(W.P. (40) 343).In discussion, the following points were raised : (1) The proposal was welcomed that there should be a naval commander-in-Chief at Londonderry in charge of convoy operations in the North-Western Approaches.(2) The Chief of the Naval Staff described a method of deep-seamining which it was intended to adopt in the North-Western Approaches.(3) The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Air Ministry would do their best to make available the additional aircraftasked for in paragraph 4 of the Memorandum by theNaval Staff. He could not promise that they would all be available in the near future.(4) The Prims Minister said that Recommendation 4 (/),namely, the provision of refrigerating trains for fillingcold storage in London from the West Coast should be implemented as a matter of urgency.

The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the minister without Portfolio (W.P. (40) 337) covering a Memorandum by theChairman of the North American Supply Committee, in which itwas recommended that a Mission headed by Sir Walter Layton, theDirector of Programmes at the Ministry of Supply, should proceedto the United States to conduct negotiations in connection withcertain difficulties with which the British Purchasing commission had met. In the view of the North American Supply Committee,it was important that our programme in the United States shouldbe closely co-ordinated with that of the United States Government.Great advantages would follow from prompt agreement on commontypes of weapons. Draft instructions to Sir Walter Layton were attached as an Appendix to the Memorandum.The War Cabinet gave a general approval to the proposals in W.P. (40) 337.Air Raids:accommodation and relief for persons renderedhomeless.(previous references:W.M. (40) 235thConclusions,Minute 5, andW.M. (40) 236thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord Privy Seal (W.P. (G.) (40) 229) covering a record of an inter-Departmental meeting.The Lord Privy Seal said that his enquiries had shown thatthe steps being taken were adequate to the present requirements.In order that they should also be adequate to meet the considerably greater demands which might be made in the future, it was important that there should be machinery for co-co-ordination between local authorities.A discussion took place on the suggestion which had been putforward by the Prime Minister on the previous day that compen-sation ranging up to 100 per cent, should be made immediately available for persons of limited means who had lost their householdeffects or the stock in trade of their businesses. In connection withthe proposed compensation fund, to be built up from the proceeds of a levy on all householders [see W.M. (40) 236th Conclusions(Minute 3)], the view was expressed that any deficiency should bemade good by the State.
The Lord Privy Seal undertook to investigate these mattersfurther, in consultation with the Treasury and the other Depart-ments concerned, and to report again as soon as possible.The discussion was adjourned.French 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theColonies. French authorities in Gabon had decided to adhere to General de(Previous Gaulle, thus coming into line with the rest of French EquatorialEef erence: Africa.W.M. (40) 236thConclusions,Minute 5.)Gabon.New Caledonia. The Foreign Secretary referred to the proposal that theAustralian Government should be asked to send the cruiser A delaideto New Caledonia, for the purpose of dealing with the situation created by the arrival of a pro-Vichy sloop.The difficulty was to determine the best method of putting thematter to the Australian Government, who might hesitate to take action which would antagonise the Vichy Government. One method would be to invite them to send the cruiser to New Caledonia with instructions to order the sloop back to Tahiti, and to enforce their orders. A better method, assuming that the arrival of the A delaideoff New Caledonia had given rise to a good deal of confusion inthe island, might be for her to send a landing party ashore to. restore order. A coup d&apos;Etat might probably take place in whichthe pro-Vichy authorities would disappear. This plan would avoid the possibility of having to fire on the sloop.The War Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, the Dominions secretary and the First Lord of the Admiralty to settle in consulta-tion the terms of the message to be sent to theCommonwealth Government.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,August 30, 1940.
