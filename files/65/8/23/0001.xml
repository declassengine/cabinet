Aliens.Use of alienman-power.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 206thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (G.) (40) 192). Thefollowing were the main points made in discussion : Liability for Military Service.(i) The Minister explained that the essential point which hehad in mind was recognition of the principle thatuninterned male aliens in this country should be subjectto military service under the same general conditions as were applicable to British subjects. Provided this principle was accepted, he could proceed with his scheme.(ii) It was pointed out that legislation might possibly berequired to provide for compulsory enlistment ofuninterned male aliens. It was also clear that it wouldbe necessary for arrangements to be entered into withthe Governments or National Committees of the countries concerned.   This task would fall to the Foreign Office.(iii) The Home Secretary suggested that the enlistment ofmilitary units should be looked at from the point of viewthat a Pole, for example, should prima facie be enlistedin one of the Polish units being formed in this country.There might, however, be valid reasons why, in particular cases, enlistment into units of the British Army wouldbe more appropriate. He thought that, if an arrange-ment on the lines proposed was arrived at for uninternedmale aliens of friendly or Allied Powers, it would benecessary to accord similar treatment to enemy alienswho were trusted to be at large.Civil or Industrial Employment.(iv) The Minister of Labour and National Service said that,apart from national military service, there remainedfour classes to be dealt with : (a) the unskilled, who might be used, e.g., for forestryor land reclamation :(b) the skilled men :(c) a limited number of highly-skilled men, mostly Poles,who would be useful in aircraft production work :(d) professional workers with high qualifications.As regards (c), the Minister proposed to discuss withthe Production Departments whether it would be feasible to allocate a separate factory, as in the last war, in whichskilled alien workers could be employed together.As regards (d) he proposed to transfer to the new international Labour Branch the existing Central AlienRegister of Professional Workers, and would requireall workers with suitable qualifications to place their names on this Register.(v) He had not touched on enemy aliens in the above scheme,but there was no reason why they should not be includedif, in the opinion of the authorities, they could be trustedto be at.large.Social Services.(vi) The Minister said that, since his Memorandum had been circulated, he had discussed with the Minister of health the proposal in paragraph 9 for dealing with social services. The Minister of Health was opposed to thesuggestion made in his Paper, which he thought carriedwith it an implication of preferential treatment foraliens as compared with British subjects.   He thought,
Germany.Herr Hitler&apos;sReichstagspeech on19th July.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 209thConclusions,Minute 11.)2. The War Cabinet were informed that a suggestion hadbeen received to the effect that it would be desirable to arrange the business of the House on Thursday, the 25th July, so that there could be a Debate on questions arising out of Herr Hitler&apos;s speech.The view taken by the War Cabinet was that this request shouldnot be agreed to. Further, the Press should be informed that thePrime Minister was not proposing to make a statement on Thursday,the 25th July, and should be discouraged from suggesting thatthere was anything in Herr Hitler&apos;s speech which called for anofficial reply from this country.therefore, that the best plan would be that aliens whofell out of employment should be dealt with by theUnemployment Assistance Board. This point would befurther discussed with the Chairman of the Board.Seamen.(vii) The Minister said that there were a large number of alienseamen in this country. It was proposed that seamenshould also be brought within the scope of our social services. The Allied Shipowners&apos; Association had formed a Committee to help in handling this problem.He was in touch with the Minister of Shipping on anumber of related matters.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved generally the proposals in the Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour and National Service, includingthe establishment of an International Labour Branch(assisted by an Advisory Committee) to organise the useof alien man-power for our war effort, subject to (2)-(6)below.(2) Agreed in principle that all uninterned male aliens in thiscountry should be liable to military service on the same conditions as British subjects.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toconsider conclusion (2) in consultation with the Ministerof Labour and National Service, with a view tonegotiating agreements with the Foreign countries or national Committees concerned (Belgium, Czecho-Slovakia, France, Holland, Norway, Poland).(4) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service toconsider whether legislation was necessary to give effectto conclusion (2).(5) Took note that the Minister of Labour and National Serviceproposed to consult the Chairman of the unemployment assistance Board in regard to the position of aliens,who would now be brought within the scope of ourSocial Services, during the period before they qualified for benefit.(6) Took note that the Minister of Labour and National service was in consultation with the Minister of Shipping inregard to the special problems affecting alien seamen.
France.Frenchposition in north Africa.Attitude of spain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 196thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs invited attentionto telegram No. 563 from Sir Samuel Hoare reporting a conversation which he had had with the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairsupon the position in North Africa. The Spanish Governmentfeared that the French territories in North Africa were on the vergeof anarchy, and were considering the possibility of taking over theduty of keeping order in French Morocco.The Foreign Secretary said that his first inclination was to treat this as primarily a matter between Spain and France; butto indicate to the Spanish Government that, if the French territories in North Africa fell into chaos, we should welcome action by themto maintain order; and that in this event the future of the territories would be settled after the war, by consultation. While we should avoid committing ourselves too far in this matter, it was also important to encourage Spanish consultation and co-operation with us.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Egypt. 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the(Previous latest telegrams (Nos. 777 and 779) showed that the Prime minister reference: of Egypt was having considerable trouble in settling his difficultiesW.M.
