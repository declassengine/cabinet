Aliens. 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the(Previous Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (G.) (40) 187) suggesting the appointmentReference: of a special organisation for dealing with aliens, and outlining theW.M. (40) 200th duties which should be assigned to it.Conclusions, The Lord Privy Seal said that he had discussed this proposalMinute 15.)       with the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for War, whohad expressed their agreement with his proposal.(1) In the course of discussion, the view was expressed thatenemy aliens must be treated differently from otheraliens. Public opinion favoured the internment of enemy aliens generally. Further, the Security Officerstook the view that, if this country was invaded, aconsiderable number of enemy aliens, who might nowbe genuinely well-disposed to this country, would, by virtue of their nationality, help the enemy. On this view,even enemy aliens who were refugees from the nazi regime presented a potential danger.(2) It followed that further examination of the Category &quot; C &quot;enemy aliens was unlikely to result in the release of anysubstantial number. The release of enemy aliens from internment could only be justified to the extent thatthe services which they could render to the Stateoutweighed the potential danger of their being at large.(3) Public opinion, while insistent on the internment of enemy aliens, was anxious that they should be treated withconsideration. The Home Secretary said that the nucleus of an organisation had been set up in the HomeOffice, under Sir John Moylan, to deal with the problemsof internment; and to look after the general interestsof aliens in internment camps. He agreed that it wouldbe desirable that this organisation should have associatedwith it a body of the kind suggested by the Lord privy seal.(4) General agreement was expressed with the view that itwould be desirable to have a body constituted on thegeneral lines suggested by the Lord Privy Seal to dealwith welfare matters. Certain suggestions were madewith a view to strengthening the personnel of theproposed Committee.(5) It was also thought that it would be desirable to set upanother Committee which could act as a buffer betweenthe Home Secretary and public opinion in respect ofthe policy to be pursued in regard to the internment of enemy aliens. This purpose, however, could only beachieved by a smaller Committee, of a somewhat morejudicial character than the Committee to deal withwelfare matters. This smaller Committee might, forexample, be composed of : the Master of the Rolls as chairman, Sir Herbert Emerson, and General NeillMalcolm. The substance of the terms of reference might be : (i) To examine the application of the principles laiddown in regard to internment, and to make recommendations thereon to the Home Office orother Departments concerned.(ii) To consider and make recommendations on anyparticular cases remitted to them by the HomeOffice or other Departments concerned.While this Committee could not undertake a systematicreview of all the cases concerned, border-line cases couldbe remitted to it.(6) The Minister of Labour and National Service referred tothe non-enemy aliens of what might be described as the
The Far Bast. 2.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it(Previous was proposed to make an interim statement in Parliament that reference:        afternoon on the following lines : W.M. (40) 205th That substantial progress had been made towards agree-Conclusions, ment, but that, owing to the resignation of the JapaneseMinute 2.) Government, the negotiations had not been actually concluded,and that, at the moment, no more could be said, but that itwas hoped to make a fuller statement at an early date.&quot; refugee category,&quot; who had recently come to thiscountry. There was a large number of them, particularlyin the London area, who were being supported by theState and for whom no work had been found. He was engaged on preparing a Paper setting out an organisa-tion which he would suggest should be set up to find employment for these people.The suggestion that such an organisation should beset up met with general approval.(7) In discussion, the Lord Privy Seal explained that thesuggestion in his paper that the proposed specialorganisation should endeavour to find suitable work foraliens capable of it, was only intended to apply to findingwork in internment camps. The finding of work outsideinternment camps fell within the scope of the Ministerof Labour and National Service.(8) The Lord President of the Council summarised the upshotof the discussion by reference to the duties of theproposed special organisation set out under heads (a) to\g) on page 2 of the Lord Privy Seahs Paper.Head (e) would not be performed by either of the organisations proposed, unless specific cases wereremitted to the suggested Committee of Three by theHome Office. This Committee would, however, becharged with seeing that the general principles laiddown were carried out.Heads (c) and (/), in so far as they related to non-enemy aliens, would be carried out by the Ministry ofLabour.Heads (a), (b), (d) and (g) would be the function of the larger advisory body proposed. (See (4) above.)(9) It was thought that the War Office should continue to beresponsible for finding and guarding concentrationcamps. They would also have to be responsible for what were known as &quot; Quartermaster-General &quot; services, and medical services.(10) The Home Office should continue to be responsible for determing questions of security in regard to enemy aliens, and aliens generally.(11) To which Department should the proposed Committees beattached ? The Committee referred to in (5) would clearly be attached to the Home Office. The largerCommittee, referred to in (4), might be attached eitherto the Home Office or to the Foreign Office. In eitherevent it would require to be linked up with the existing organisations dealing with war refugees.The War Cabinet (i) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to revise his Memorandum,in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, inthe light of the discussion which had taken place, andto submit it to the War Cabinet.(ii) Invited the Minister of Labour to prepare, and submit to the War Cabinet, a. scheme for finding work for non-enemy aliens who had recently come to this country.
The Foreign Secretary said that no more news had been receivedfrom Japan, but the position did not look very favourable. Asuggestion had been made that it would be desirable even now toattempt to conclude the Agreement before the change of Governmentin Japan took effect.   In his opinion, this would be a mistake.Agreement was expressed with this view.The Lord President of the Council said that it was difficultto excuse Mr. Cordell Huli&apos;s statement on the previous day whichdescribed our action in closing the Burma road as &quot; an unwarrantedinterposition of obstacles to world trade.&quot; Mr. Hull had knownof the line we were about to take, and had agreed that the UnitedStates could have no cause for complaint, as they were unwillingthemselves to take a hand in Far Eastern affairs.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 17, 1940.
