The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the tension between this country and Japan had certainly relaxed (seetelegram No. 1849 R from Tokyo).He was considering the release of one or two of the Japanesewhom we had arrested, but, on the whole, he was disposed to waiton events for a day or two longer. Later on, perhaps through themediation of a third party, the dispute might be terminated by theexchange of the remaining prisoners.There was a good deal of evidence that the Japanese intendedto invade French Indo-China. In reply to a question from theAmerican Ambassador in Tokyo, however, Mr. Matsuoka haddisclaimed any such intention.The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to instruct sir Robert Craigie to put a similar question.

(40) 220th        U.S.S.R.Conclusions,Minute 3.) In discussion it was argued that by withholding recognitionwe should gain nothing, but might alienate Russia. On the otherhand, if we granted de facto recognition, we should be taking aweaker line than the United States. Further, Russia might attackFinland again and absorb the whole country.
