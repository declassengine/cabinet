The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Moscow telegram No: 591, containing an account of Sir stafford cripps&apos;s conversation with M. Molotov on the 8th August.   WeW.M.

(40) 222ndConclusions,Minute 3.)contraband control.Question.of the admission of foodstuffs to enemy-occupied territory andunoccupiedFrance.3. The Foreign Secretary said that he was not yet ready tomake a recommendation as to the recognition of the Russianabsorption of the Baltic States. He was considering whether wecould grant de facto, but not de jure, recognition. One difficulty was that there seemed little prospect that the Soviet would agreeto give compensation for the extinction of our private interests inthose countries.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister for Economic Warfare (W.P. (G.) (40) 208).The Minister for Economic Warfare said that he was satisfiedthat there would be no famine this winter in the &apos;&apos; enslavedterritories&quot; unless the Germans took food away from them toGermany. He was satisfied that the present policy of blockading&quot;unoccupied &quot; as well as &quot; occupied &quot; France should be maintained,and that we should take active steps to remove ignorance of thefacts, particularly in America. He also favoured a declaration,first, that we were imposing the blockade in order to shorten thewar; secondly, that, as soon as any area threw off Hitler&apos;s yoke,ample food would be available for it.Ah? Operations. 1.   The Chief of the Air Staff reported that the fighting which(Previous had taken place off the Isle of Wight on the previous day had been reference: the biggest air action which had so far taken place off our coasts.W.M. (40) 222nd The enemy&apos;s main effort had developed into three successive attacks,Conclusions, involving at least 300 aircraft. In the course of combat with these minute 1.) &apos; forces, our fighters had achieved great success. The air casualties were estimated to be as follows :  
The Prime Minister said that we should have to pay regardto United States opinion in this matter. While at present that opinion was satisfactory, we might later find ourselves engaged ina rearguard action. He thought that we should take the followingline : First, that there was plenty of food at the present time andthat there could be no talk of famine immediately after the harvest.Secondly, that if there should be any talk of food shortage, thiswas due to the deliberate German policy of &quot; Guns, not Butter,&quot;and to maldistribution of sources of food by the Germans. Thethird line of defence should be that, if any food was allowed into,say, unoccupied France, it was almost certain that the germans would get hold of it. If, nevertheless, opinion in the United states should at some later date be strongly in favour of sending food into,say, unoccupied France, we should ask them to explain whatadministrative safeguards could be introduced.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that a powerful argument against the admission of food to unoccupied france would be to point out that the attitude of the people of,say, Holland and Poland in occupied territory entitled them to more consideration than unoccupied France under the PetainGovernment.The Minister of Information undertook to see that the Pressdid not publish cartoons of famine stalking through Europe. Itwould be useful to make play with Hitler&apos;s boasts that he hadplenty of food for his people.The Prime Minister thought it would be premature to makethe suggested declaration at the present time; but the point shouldbe borne in mind.The Foreign Secretary said that he was content with the policy outlined by the Minister for Economic Warfare, provided that itwas not regarded as immutable, and could be reviewed if thesituation changed.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that our policy should be not to relax the blockade of enemy-occupied territories, and of unoccupied France,by permitting the entry of foodstuffs. Continuance ofthis policy must, of course, be subject to review if thesituation changed.(2) Decided that no public declaration on the lines suggested should be made for the present.(3) Invited the Minister of Information to take steps to seethat the Press dealt with the question on the lines suggested in discussion.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,August 9, 1940.
