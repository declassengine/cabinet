Priority Policy.Tanks and aircraft.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 116thConclusions,Minute 1.)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Aircraft Production (W.P. (40) 313) and a Memo-randum by the Minister without Portfolio (W.P. (40) 316) relatingto priority for the Production of Tanks. The following were themain points of the discussion : (i) The Minister of Supply said that, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, he had been examining thequestion of the production of alloys and drop forgings,and there was little doubt that it could be increased.The trouble had been that, at the time of the Frenchcollapse, there had been a great increase in the demandfor these materials, which had outrun capacity, andthere had been no proper system of priority of allocation.(ii) The Minister emphasised that, if speedy production of tanks was-required, it would be necessary to give thempriority 1 (a) along with the aircraft.(iii) The Prime Minister said that this question should not bediscussed as though the point at issue was whether weshould have aircraft or tanks. We needed both. there could be no doubt that aircraft must have priority asfar as was necessary and until certain requirementswere satisfied. The Fighter was our salvation and the bomber offered means of victory. He could not admit,however, that, whilst giving aircraft first priority, wecould not also produce large numbers of tanks, providedthat the available resources were allocated to essential needs.(iv) The Minister without Portfolio pointed out that, if tanks were given priority 1 (b) only, they would be in corn-petition with all the other items in that group. Hethought that tanks should receive preference over theother items which received priority 1 (b).(v) The Minister of Aircraft Production gave details of theeffects of recent bombing attacks on aircraft production.There would be some loss of capacity, but he hoped thatthe output figures would not show a serious drop. Atthe moment, however, the rate of casualties exceeded therate of production.(vi) Discussion ensued as to the capacity for drop forgings.The present output was at the rate of 4,000 tons a week.The chief users were : 1,290 tons to the Ministry of Supply, most of whichwas used for wheeled vehicles;1,050 tons to the Air Ministry;440 tons to the War Office; and470 tons to the Admiralty.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that mostof the Ministry of Supply allocation was used forwheeled vehicles.(vii) General agreement was expressed with the view that far too great a proportion of the capacity for forgings andfor steel alloys was being used in the manufacture of motor cars and vehicles (not of fighting types) for theArmy. The view was expressed that there were plenty of motor cars and lorries in this country at presentdevoted to civil purposes which could be used by theFighting Services, though, no doubt, with some loss of efficiency.
(viii) The Minister of Aircraft Production thought that, ifmotor cars, lorries and other wheeled vehicles were given a lower priority, there would be sufficient capacity for both tanks and aircraft.(ix) Discussion ensued on a suggestion put forward by thePrime Minister that tanks should be definitely accordedPriority 1 (a), subject to an understanding that, wherethere was any conflict between the requirements for aircraft and tanks, the matter should be settled by con-sultation between the Minister of Aircraft Productionand the Minister of Supply. In effect, this would mean that tanks should be given Priority 1 (a), except inregard to the points of conflict with aircraft, in regardto which they should be given Priority 1 (b).The Minister of Aircraft Production did not seehis way to accept this suggestion. If tanks were givenequal priority with aircraft, the result would be afalling off in aircraft production. Thus, some of thehammers at present used on aircraft work would be diverted by the Steel controller to tank production.After further discussion, the War Cabinet agreed asfollows :  (1) That Priority 1 (a) should&apos; continue to be accorded tothe following : Fighter, bomber and trainer aircraft.Instruments and equipment for such aircraft.Anti-aircraft equipment (especially Boforsguns, instruments and ammunitiontherefor, except as provided in (2) and (3)below).Small arms and small-arm ammunition; bombs.Component parts of the above articles.(2) Balloons, winches, motor cars and lorries for the RoyalAir  Force,  which  had  hitherto  been  accordedPriority   1  (a),   should  in   future  be  accordedPriority 2.(3) Likewise,&apos; such lorries and motor cars for the other two Services as have hitherto been accordedPriority 1 (a) or 1 (b) should in future be accordedPriority 2.(4) Tanks should be accorded Priority 1 (b).(5) The Minister of Aircraft Production and the Ministerof Supply should arrange to exercise a joint controlover alloy steel and drop forgings.(6) The Minister of Supply should report to the WarCabinet to what extent the above arrangements might be expected to retard the tank programme.(7) The whole matter should be subject to review by theWar Cabinet in a fortnight&apos;s time.(8) The three Service Departments should consider how they could reduce their demands for the manufac-ture of motor cars, lorries, &amp;c.
