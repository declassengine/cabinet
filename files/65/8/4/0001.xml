The Air 2.   The Chief of the Air Staff gave the following informationSituation. to supplement that contained in Cabinet War Room Record No. 304.(Previous There had been an increase in German air activities in daylightReference: over this country on the previous day, but there had been far fewerW.M. (40) 191st ra-ids at night, only 12 aircraft having been plotted. This mightConclusions, De due to weather conditions. The night raids had apparently been minute 1.) &apos;      directed against South Wales, but the aircraft had bombed atrandom in Dorset, Staffordshire, Oxfordshire, Leicestershire andSussex.There had been reason to believe that the Germans were flyingFrench aircraft in France, and a suspicious case had occurred of aHudson flying near the British coast with no markings.The reports of the bombing of the Scharnhorst on the night ofthe 30th June-lst July indicated that hits had been registered bothon the ship and on the floating dock.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.[21508] b 2Prance. 1.   The War Cabinet were informed that the recommendationsMembers of made by Sir Robert Vansittart&apos;s Committee at their meeting theFrench Civil previous morning, and reported to the War Cabinet at their previousand Military meeting, had been made on the assumption that the War CabinetMissions in had already decided in principle on the segregation of certainLondon. members of the Missions.   The Committee had subsequently been(Previous informed, however, that it had been intended that they should reference:        express their views as to the advisibility of action on these lines.W.M. (40) 191st They had accordingly met on the previous afternoon, and had recom-jp        Conclusions,      mended that the proposals in regard to segregation should be appliedMinute 13.)       to only a limited number of members of the Missions whom it wasconsidered important to prevent from leaving this country onaccount of the specialised secret knowledge which they mightpossess.   The Committee had given a number of reasons against any wider application of the scheme.   In particular : (1) The members of the Missions could not leave the country without special permission, and telegraphic communica-tion with France had been cut.(2) Too drastic action might turn against us Frenchmen whowould be willing to help us.(3) Retaliatory action might be taken against British Consulsin French overseas territories.After discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows : I. The general principles to be observed in this matter shouldbe :(a) To ensure that technicians with specialised secretknowledge should on no account be allowed toleave this country.(b) To put a stop to dangerous or defeatist activities ofany members of the Mission who were believed to be acting against our interests.(c) To avoid action which would act as a discouragementto Frenchmen who were friendly to us.II. The Foreign Secretary was asked to instruct Sir robert vansittart&apos;s Committee to watch the position from day to day and to advise on the action necessary to give effectto the above principles.III. As the situation was likely to change rapidly, no action should be taken until Thursday, the 4th July.
Choice of ah A discussion as to air objectives is recorded in the Secretary&apos;sobjectives.        Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 189thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. Reference was made to the. report which had appeared inthe Press of 11 killed and 109 injured as the result of an air raidon the Newcastle area during the previous day.It was generally felt that it was undesirable to publish the exact number of air raid casualties. This gave the enemy informa-tion which should be withheld from him and might have ademoralising effect in this country.The War Cabinet agreed -That reports of casualties caused by German air raidsshould in future be stated in general terms and should not give the details of the precise numbers killed and injured.Air RaidCasualties.Question of publication.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that we continued to suffer losses in merchant shipping from U-Boat attacks in theWestern Approaches. All possible steps were being taken toimprove the situation.Information was given as to the present Fleet dispositions in home Waters.The War Cabinet-Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to arrange forthe War Cabinet to be informed of the views of theCommander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet as to how theHome Fleet should be disposed, in order to repel an attempt on the part of the enemy to bring a convoy escorted by heavy ships across the North Sea.France.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet were given the latest information on thismatter.A record of the discussion,contained in  the  Secretary&apos;conclusions.and of the conclusions reached, isStandard File of War  Cabinet6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegram No. 102 from Casablanca, reporting that M. Daladier had made it known that he was most anxious to reach England, and had suggested that we should arrange to bring him either by destroyeror by flying-boat.It was pointed out that there would be considerable practicaldifficulties in acceding to this request. . It was also felt that while we should certainly take steps to bring to this country the party of French Ministers on the Massiglia, which included M. Mandeland M. Campinchi, the arrival in this country of M. Daladier alonemight be embarrassing politically.The War Cabinet agreed To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs tosend a temporising and sympathetic reply which wouldnot commit us to bringing M. Daladier to England at thepresent time.
U.S.S.B. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a longSoviet-Turkish telegram had been received from Sir Stafford Cripps reporting anrelations. interview with Stalin on the 1st July.(Previous This telegram reported a suggestion from Stalin that HisEeference:        Majesty&apos;s Government should use their good offices to improveW.M. (40) 178th relations between the Soviet and Turkey.   The view taken was that conclusions,      there would be no objection to such a demarche if it meant that weMinute 10.)       should use our influence to restrain any feelings of hostility on thepart of Turkey towards Russia;  but that we could not allow ourselves to become involved in negotiations between the SovietGovernment and Turkey, initiated by the former, with a view to obtaining control of the Straits.The War Cabinet :-Postponed further consideration of this question pendingreceipt of an explanatory telegram from Sir stafford cripps.Norway.Proposed forma-tion of a new government.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 187thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theNorwegian Minister had called on him two days ago and had saidthat the Norwegian Parliament had recently proposed that thepresent Norwegian Government should be replaced and a new government formed to take over the functions of both the king and the present Government. M. Koht had asked what the positionof His Majesty&apos;s Government would be. He (the Foreign Secretary)had replied that he had no doubt that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould continue to recognise the Norwegian leaders who were in thiscountry.  He had undertaken, however, to submit a formal reply.The War Cabinet: Agreed that the formal reply to the Norwegian Ministersenquiry should be on the lines indicated by the foreign secretary.Palestine.Proposed answer to GeneralNuri&apos;s enquiry.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 167thConclusions,Minute 13.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (G.) (40) 165) as to the reply to be made by our Ambassador in Baghdad to the enquiryaddressed to him by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairsregarding the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Palestine.The following points of view were put forward in discussion :-(1) A Declaration on the lines proposed was urgently required at the present time in order to steady the position in theMiddle East. It was essential to put a stop to thesuspicions that we were changing our policy.(2) On the other hand, it was urged that the proposed announce-ment was not big enough to have any appreciable effecton Arab opinion, or to discount German and Italianpropaganda. Recent telegrams had not shown any demand for a statement of this kind. Opinion in theMiddle East was more likely to turn in our favour ifwe could accomplish some military success in that region.(3) Certain members of the War Cabinet were anxious to avoid any public statement specifically re-endorsing theWhite Paper policy. At the same time they agreed thatit was out of the question to revise that policy at thepresent time.After further discussion, the War Cabinet decided : (i) That the reply to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign affairs should read as follows : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government do not see any reasonto make any change in their policy for Palestineas laid down in May 1939 and it remains unchanged.&quot;
Palestine.Raising ofgarrisoncompanies.(ii) That our representatives in the Middle East should be. authorised, if asked, to say that the announcement setout. in (i) implied what was set out in the last para-graph of the sentence contained in the draft suggestedby the Foreign Secretary in W.P. (G.) (40) 165, viz. : &quot; But they hope and expect that when the war isended,  conditions in  Palestine will permit  thevarious stages of constitutional development  tofollow one another in orderly succession, on the linesalready laid down.&quot;10. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that hehad received a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief, middle east, asking permission to raise six garrison companies ofPalestinians, armed only with rifles and revolvers. It was proposedthat Jews- and Arabs should be allocated to separate companies and that the companies should be attached to different regiments.The War Cabinet :-Approved the proposal of the Commander-in-Chief, middle east.CzechoslovakProvisionalGovernment.Proposals for recognition.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 186thConclusions,Minute 4.)11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs recommending that a communication should now be addressed to M. Benes informing him that, if he could secure the collaboration of the persons indicated by him in a recent communication to the Foreign Office, HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to consider givingrecognition to a Czechoslovak Provisional Government soconstituted, under certain conditions which would be discussed withhim when the necessary collaboration had been achieved. Theconditions are set out in paragraph 7 of the Memorandum(W.P. (G.) (40) 168).The War Cabinet approved this proposal.Internees and 12.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the prisoners of Lord  President of  the  Council  (W.P.   (G.)   (40)  170).    this war. Memorandum set out the progress made with the removal overseas(Previous of internees and prisoners.   The points on which a decision was reference:asked for were as follows : W.M. (40) 175thConclusions,Minute 12.)(1) The Lord President thought that we should adhere to thearrangements made for the shipment of internees to canada and Newfoundland that week, although this might mean the inclusion amongst those sent of interneesin the categories which the Home Secretary desired to exclude.(2) It was proposed to delay the shipments to Australia for afew days to enable the internees to be more carefully selected.(3) A decision whether the German and Italian Governmentshould be informed and a public announcement made ofthe loss of life from the torpedoing of the A randora Starshould be left to be decided by the Foreign Secretary,in consultation with the Minister of Information andthe First Lord of the Admiralty.In view of the sinking of the Arandora Star the War cabinet were reminded that the Ettrick was due to sail for Quebec that day,carrying 858 B Class Germans, 1,348 German prisoners of war, and405 young single Italians.  The vessel would be unescorted.
The War Cabinet-I. Approved the recommendations summarised at (1), (2) and(3) above.II. Agreed that the S.S. Ettrick should sail as arranged, butthat no announcement should be made regarding hersailing.The PrimeMinistersStatement inParliament.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 190thConclusions,Minute 2.)13. The War Cabinet took into consideration the latest information received as to action to be taken in regard to the french fleet.The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to state in the House ofCommons that afternoon that the Prime Minister wouldmake a statement in Parliament on the following day.Home Defence.Evacuation ofcivil population from Bast andSouth-east coast towns.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 184thConclusions,Minute 1.)14. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 240) inviting the War Cabinet to review the decision reached at the Meeting referred to in the margin, inthe light of the indications that major operations against thiscountry, either by invasion or by heavy air attack, might now startat any time.   The following points were made in discussion : (1) The Chief of the Air Staff and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff said that there were many signs whichpointed to an attempt to invade this country in the nearfuture, and which could not be ignored. Emphasis was laid on the danger of delaying the move until too late.(2) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat voluntary evacuation was still being stimulated andhad reached 50 per cent, in the South-east Coast towns.(3) The scheme would involve the removal of some 200,000people. Whole families would have to be billeted com-pulsorily. If invasion did not follow, a difficult situation might ensue.(4) Public opinion was already somewhat jumpy, and wouldbecome more so if this scheme of compulsory evacuation from East and South-east coast towns was carried out.Further, people on other parts of the coast would askwhy they also were not evacuated.(5) People evacuated from the coastal strip were liable to bebombed in the backward areas.(6) If an attempt at invasion was made, it would probably be only at a few points on the coast. Was it necessary tocarry out the evacuation scheme from the whole of thiscoastal strip, when only a few points were likely to beaffected by attack?The War Cabinet agreed (1) To adhere to the decision reached by them on the27th June &quot; That the scheme for the compulsory evacuation ofall but essential people from the nineteen East coast towns between Sheringham and Folkestone shouldnot be put into operation for the present.&quot;(2) That the Minister of Home Security should continue to take steps to stimulate the voluntary evacuation of the civilpopulation from these towns.
(3) That in connection with (2) it should be made known that people who were in an area affected by operations, if andwhen an invasion was attempted, would have to staywhere they were.Public Morale.Proposedinstruction tothe.Services.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 191stConclusions,Minute 10.)15. The Prime Minister said that, on further consideration,he thought that it would be better that a single letter should besent from himself to the Fighting Services and to the Civil Depart-ments. A draft which he had prepared was handed round. (Copyattached as Appendix.)The War Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to send a letter in the termsof the draft for communication to high Officers in thethree Services, and to persons holding responsiblepositions in the Civil Service :(2) Agreed that this letter should be published in the Presstwo or three days after it had been so issuedvRichmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 3, 1940.APPENDIX.(See Minute 15.)ON what may be the eve of an attempted invasion or battle for our nativeland, the Prime Minister desires to impress upon all persons holding responsiblepositions in the Government, in the Fighting Services, or in the Civil Depart-ments, their duty to maintain a spirit of alert and confident energy. While everyprecaution must be taken that time and means afford, there are no grounds forsupposing that more German troops can be landed in this country, either fromthe air or across the sea, than can be destroyed or captured by the strong forcesat present under arms. The Royal Air Force is in excellent order and at thehighest strength it has yet attained. The German Navy was never so weak, northe British army at home so strong as now. The Prime Minister expects all his Majesty&apos;s servants in high places to set an example of steadiness andresolution. They should check and rebuke expressions of loose and ill-digestedopinion in their circles, or by their subordinates. They should not hesitate toreport, or if necessary remove, any officers or officials who are found to beconsciously exercising a disturbing or depressing influence, and whose talk is calculated to spread alarm and despondency. Thus alone will they be worthy ofthe fighting men, who, in the air, on the sea, and on land, have already met theenemy without any sense of being outmatched in martial qualities.
