France. .The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 189thConclusions,Minute 15.)Prime ministers statement inParliament.1.   The War Cabinet continued their discussion on this matter.A record of the discussion, and of the Conclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.2. Some discussion took place as to whether the PrimeMinister should make a statement in Parliament during the present week. The view generally expressed was that it would be very undesirable at the moment that any undertaking should be given that the Prime Minister would make a statement on Thursday.The best line would be to let it be known that the Prime minister was unlikely to make a statement in the present week.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a Debatehad been arranged in the House of Lords on Thursday on a Motiondealing with foreign affairs.It was thought that the best plan would be to arrange, ifpossible, for this Motion to be postponed until the ensuing week.If events took place which made it necessary or desirable fora statement to be made by the Prime Minister later in the week,this could always be arranged at short notice; in which case acorresponding statement could also be made in the House of Lords.It was suggested that the Minister of Information should beasked to let it be known that the Prime Minister was unlikely tomake a statement in the course of the present week.The War Cabinet-Agreed that arrangements should be made on these lines.London.France. 3.   The Prime Minister said that certain members of theseMembers of Missions were believed to be actively working against our interests.French Military Immediate action should be taken to ensure that these people wereand Civil not left in a position in which they could continue to act in this way.Missions in The War Cabinet agreed as follows :-(1) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook toensure that this matter was brought before Sir robert vansittart&apos;s Committee on French matters on thefollowing morning.(2) The Secretary of the War Cabinet was instructed to ensurethat a list of the persons concerned was immediately available.(3) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security was invited to make immediate preparations to ensure thata suitable place outside London was available to whichthese persons could be sent.Home Defence.Local defence volunteers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 170thConclusions,Minute 9.)4. The question was raised whether adequate use was being-made of the members of the Local Defence Volunteer Service. Itwould be very unfortunate if there was any failure to make thefullest practicable use of the widespread desire for combatantservice.The War Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with theSecretary of State for War, to enquire into the arrange-ments for the equipment and employment of the local defence Volunteers.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 1, 1940.
