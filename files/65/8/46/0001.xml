(40) 230thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Chief of the Air Staff said that in the air fightingover this country on Saturday, the 24th August, we had destroyed41 enemy aircraft for certain. We had lost 20 machines, but the pilots of 14 had been saved.On Sunday, the 25 th August, our fighters had destroyed 48enemy machines for certain, and the anti-aircraft guns had destroyed 6. We had lost 16 machines, from which 10 pilots hadbeen killed or missing and 4 had been wounded.We had despatched a large number of aircraft to bomb military targets in Berlin, but the weather had prevented a number of our machines from locating their target.It was pointed out that, whereas German aircraft unloadedtheir bombs irrespective of whether they could locate military targets, our pilots had instructions to bring their bombs back, ifthe targets could not be located. This point was worth bringingout from the point of view of public opinion in the United States.The Prime Minister said that he would prepare a draft tosend to the Ministry of Information.It was pointed out that the next monthly return would showfairly heavy casualties. The question was raised whether thepractice of issuing monthly returns should be continued, or whetherweekly returns would be better. The general view of the WarCabinet was that the monthly returns should be retained. Thefigures of casualties were not high if expressed as a percentage ofthe normal death rate, or even of the peace-time road casualties.Discussion took place as to the extent of Italian preparations for an attack on the Western Desert. A record of the discussion which ensued and of the conclusions reached is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The First Sea Lord said that 5 destroyers had attacked the seaplane base of Bomba on the night of the 23rd-24th August. TheLadybird and the Waterhen had also penetrated into the harbour at Bardia on the same night and carried out a bombardment, the moral effect of which was likely to be considerable.The Prime Minister drew attention to the heavy losses ofmerchant shipping. On two recent days these losses had amountedto 40,000 and 30,000 tons. If losses continued at this rate theposition would become serious.The First Sea Lord said that the heavy losses were believed tobe due to the adoption of new tactics by the enemy. Suitable countermeasures were under consideration.The War Cabinet Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to submit a state-ment for consideration by the War Cabinet on Friday, the30th August, as to the measures for dealing with enemy attacks on merchant shipping.&quot;217031b 2
The UnitedStates.Supply of destroyers andother munitions of war.Proposed grantof base facilities in certainBritishterritories.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 232ndConclusions,Minute 5.)2. In connection with the preceding Minute, it was againpointed out that if we could get 50 destroyers from the UnitedStates this would be a great help in fighting the submarine menace.The Prime Minister referred to a further telegram which hehad sent to Lord Lothian. The Chiefs of Staff had been invitedto prepare a statement showing what British air and naval facilities the United States would wish to avail themselves of in the WesternAtlantic. On the basis of this statement we should make a definiteoffer of facilities to the United States Government, but withoutinviting a specific quid pro quo.The War Cabinet approved this suggestion.Foreign Affairs. 3    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred toItaly and Greece, telegram No. 744 from our Minister at Athens.   It was important(Previous to do all we could to assure Greece that we should provide some reference: immediate military and financial help if Greece was attacked byW.M. (40) 233rd Italy.  He would like in his reply to this telegram to indicate, first,Conclusions, that we should carry out a more intensive bombing of militaryMinute 7.) targets in Italy; secondly, that we should be ready to considerfinancial help.The War Cabinet-(1) Expressed general agreement with the Foreign Secretary&apos;suggestions.(2) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to consider the practicability of operating bomber squadrons from aerodromes in greece.The Foreign Secretary invited attention to telegram No. 1676from Tokyo, reporting that an altercation was said to have takenplace between the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs and theGerman Ambassador regarding the despatch of General Koiso tothe Netherlands East Indies.Japan.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 233rdConclusions,Minute 7.)The middle east.Evacuation ofService families.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 217thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (40) 331) about the evacuation of Service families from the Middle East. The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, during his recent visit to this country had proposed (a) that the evacuation should be carried out as and whenopportunity offered;(b) that families should be evacuated in small batches.   Manyof the families were now in Palestine, so that there wasno risk that the evacuation would react unfavourablyupon Egyptian morale;(c) that use should be made of empty convoys, for which escortswere, in any case, provided.The Governments of India and the Union of South Africa had agreed, subject to certain limitations, to accept the families.It was now proposed to evacuate the first batch of families inthe first week of September.The Secretary of State for War said that he and the other ministers concerned agreed with General WavelUs proposals.The War Cabinet approved the proposals.in W.P.
