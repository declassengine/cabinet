The Aii-Situation.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 189thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air attack onthe Bismarck.British bombs dropped inSwitzerland.civilian casualties in holland due toBritish air attacks.1. The Chief of the Air Staff gave the following information to supplement that contained in Cabinet War Room RecordNo. 303 :-In the attack on the scharnhorst 3 pilots thought theyhad scored hits, including one who dropped a 2,000-lb. bomb,either on scharnhorst herself or the floating dock. If the dockwas seriously damaged there was the possibility of the Scharn-horst capsizing.Four German aircraft had been shot down in the previous day&apos;s daylight raid. One of them was an old-type aircraft,unarmed, used apparently for looking for the survivors from aircraft shot down in the sea. This machine had ventured toonear our coasts.The possibility of an attack on the Bismarck was discussed.Up till now we had refrained from such an attack owing to thepossibility of retaliation on our own ships which were building.It was now thought, however, that this objection would not holdgood, since the Germans would make such an attack at any time it suited them.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 315 from Berne, reporting a communique by the SwissGeneral Staff to the effect that bombs had been dropped in Switzer-land by British aircraft. Little damage had been done, but severalbombs had failed to explode.The Dutch Minister in London had informed him that theGermans were using for propaganda, purposes in Holland casualties to Dutch people caused by our air attacks. The Minister had notcomplained in any way of such attacks, but wished to see theSecretary of State for Air with a view to discussing any possible means of minimising casualties to Dutch civilians.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Operation&quot;Razzle.&quot;The naval situation.(previous reference:2. The discussion on this item and the Conclusions reached are contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.3. The War Cabinet were informed that a Sunderland air-craft had sunk the German submarine U. 26 in the western approaches.   Forty-one survivors had been picked up.A report had just been received that the Arandora Star, con-WM (40) 189th taining enemy alien internees, had been torpedoed and sunk.Conclusions,Minute 3.)The naval situation (con-tinued).Enemy actionagainstmerchantshipping.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 189thConclusions,Minute 3.)The Prime Minister observed that we must expect the germans to make out that we had sunk this ship ourselves, and perhaps to take retaliatory action against British prisoners of war.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.4. The Prime Minister questioned the wisdom of continuing to publish our merchant shipping losses. This information wasvery valuable to the enemy, and would tend to encourage theactivities of enemy submarines. Although it was true that theBritish public had always insisted on being told adverse news,however serious, their thoughts at present were more directed towards the dangers of invasion than to the dangers of starvation.The Minister of Information concurred in this view.The War Cabinet :-Agreed to suspend for the present publication of losses of merchant shipping.[Note. It proved too late to stop publication of thisweek&apos;s shipping losses.][21492]b 2
Channel Islands. 5. The War Cabinet was informed that out of a total ofGerman 92,000 inhabitants in the Channel Islands, between 21,000 and occupation. 22,000 had been evacuated under official arrangements. The number; who had left under private arrangements was not known. Thehighest proportion of those evacuated had been from Guernsey.An appeal had just been received in the Admiralty for ships totake off more of the population of the Islands. This would, ofcourse, be very difficult now that the Germans were in occupation.The Islands were of no military value to the Germans, who could operate aircraft equally well from the French coast. Theoccupation had been carried out in order that they could say thatthey were occupying British soil.The Conclusions of the War Cabinet are contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Air raid warnings.(previous reference erence:6. The War Cabinet had before them a joint Memorandumby the Minister without Portfolio and the Minister of home security (W.P. (G.) (40) 169), and a copy of a letter addressedto the Prime Minister by the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,W.M. (40) 188th Fighter Command (W.P. (40) 239).Conclusions, The Minister without Portfolio said that all the DepartmentsMmute 2.) concerned had agreed to the recommendations contained in thePaper, the object of which was to ensure the minimum interferencewith production both by day and by night, and with the sleep of munition workers. The experience of the previous week had shownthat frequent air raid warnings would have serious effects on pro-duction figures. A paper was now being prepared giving detailsof these effects. On the other hand, air attacks without previouswarning were causing a certain amount of anxiety. For example,Messrs. Cammell Laird, of Liverpool, had, as a result of the recentunexpected air attack on Liverpool, decided to abolish the night-shift and work two daylight shifts of nine hours each, therebycausing a drop in output. Some compromise was clearly necessaryin the form of a modification of the present system.The Minister of Home Security said that a modified warning system was being worked out under which a silent red warningwould be issued to the railways, docks and other establishmentswith external exempted lighting. The extent to which a silentred warning system could be used would depend on the limitations imposed by the trunk telephone system, but the results of work sofar carried out on these lines were most promising. It was hoped to have the full scheme ready within a few days.The Minister of Information hoped that no public announce-ment would be made on the lines of the suggestion contained in air marshal Dowding&apos;s letter, that unless some shelter was availablein the immediate vicinity of their dwellings, the safest course forthe public would be to remain quietly at home. An announcementof this kind would confuse the public.The Minister of Home Security said that no such announce-ment would be made. The public would only be informed that theCommander-in-Chief, Fighter Command, now had discretion to limit the air raid (red) warning, so far as possible, to places wheresevere or sustained attack was expected. It was hoped that theexhortation to workers in factories to continue work until theyheard the sound of bombs or gunfire would have a correspondinglyexhilarating effect on the morale of other civilians.The War Cabinet :-(i) Agreed that the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, fighter command, should limit the air raid (red) warning, sofar as possible, to places where severe or sustained attack was expected.
(ii) Agreed that workers in factories should be informed thatin order to defeat the enemy&apos;s efforts to dislocate pro-duction, they should continue at work, even though an air raid warning had been given, and should not go toshelters until they heard the sound of bombs or gunfire.(iii) Took note that the question whether it was practicable to institute a modification of the warning system, underwhich a special silent warning could be given toestablishments with exempted lighting, was under examination by the Minister of Home Security, whowould submit a report on the matter within a few days.Spain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 183rdConclusions,Minute 11.)Arrival ofAnzana andNegrin inEngland.France.Position in syria: Frenchvolunteers.(previous references:W.M. (40) 187thConclusions,Minute 1, andW.M. (40) 189thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred totelegrams 434 and 446 from Madrid. Sir Samuel Hoare reportedthat the Spanish press was featuring the escape and arrival inthis country of Azana and Negrin and other anti-Franco leaders in a British warship. This was creating a very difficult situation for him.In discussion, the following points were made : (1) The party had apparently been admitted into this country on temporary visas issued last May and valid for twoor three weeks.(2) While in this country, they would not be at liberty to engage in any political activity.(3) It was our traditional practice to admit and to givesanctuary to refugees, and it would be undesirable to turn out this party to please the Government of a not toofriendly State.(4) On the other hand, the presence of these anti-Franco leaders in England at this juncture was most embarrassing.It was suggested that they might be given every encouragement and inducement to leave this countrywillingly and to proceed to Mexico.The War Cabinet: Invited the Foreign Secretary, in conjunction with theLord Privy Seal, to consider what steps could be takento induce Azana and Negrin and other anti-Franco leaders to leave England voluntarily as soon as possible, and toreport further to the War Cabinet.8. The Prime Minister read telegrams* from No. 8 (Salisbury-Jones) Military Mission, to the effect that the Mission had receivedorders to close down and leave Syria. The movement of formedbodies of French troops across the frontier into Palestine had nowceased, and the French Authorities were anxious that movements of individuals should be stopped and that units which had alreadycrossed the frontier should be persuaded to return. ColonelSalisbury-Jones had stated that such action would have a disaterous efect on the remaining pro-British Frenchmen and suggestedpropaganda by radio from Palestine on. the following lines : &quot; The British have undertaken not to encourage desertionfrom the French Army. At the same time, it is false thatvolunteers whose honour forbids them to obey the dictates ofthe Bordeaux Government are not welcome, or that they arereturned to the French Authorities. No volunteers have beenor will be turned back.&quot;Such a broadcast might lead to a movement within the french army which would result in the restoration of the situation undera younger leader.* Nos. 666 and 673.
The Prime Minister then referred to a telegramt from theGeneral Officer Commanding, Palestine, saying that 15 train-loadsof Poles had arrived in the country.Every encouragement should be given to French troops whowere prepared to fight on, as it was from these elements that theproposed French Force for action in the Colonies would be formed.General de Gaulle had already formed three battalions in thiscountry, and had collected 380 aviators, 1,000 young men anxiousto serve, and a company of small tanks.The Admiralty should consider whether these Allied troops could be brought from Syria, through the Mediterranean, to thiscountry or elsewhere. Meanwhile, it was most important that theWar Office should take the necessary steps to encourage french troops to cross into Palestine.The Secretary of State for War said that he would welcomea broadcast on the lines suggested in Colonel Salisbury-Jones&apos;s tele-gram. General Wavell, however, was in a difficult position withregard to Syria, and was anxious that the military situation in thatcountry should not further deteriorate.The War Cabinet: Invited the Secretary of State for War to arrange for a broadcast from Palestine on the lines suggested by ColonelSalisbury-Jones.Home Defence.(previous reference erences:W.M.

(40) 175thConclusions,Minute 2.)Digging up open spaces.9. The War Cabinet were informed that there was a gooddeal of talk, which seemed to be put about deliberately, to the effectthat the arrangements to ensure unity of command over the three services in Home Defence were not satisfactory. It was suggestedthat the existing arrangements did not allow of clear and rapiddecisions, and that the system would entail frequent reference to higher authorities in the course of operations.The War Cabinet favoured the publication of a brief state-ment explaining in outline the present system. The Chiefsof Staff were invited to submit a preliminary draft statement to the Prime Minister. The draft as approved by the PrimeMinister would later be circulated to the War Cabinet, whowould decide whether the statement could be published without detriment to the public interest.One point on which public opinion was sensitive was the needfor the civil power to be subordinated to the military power. Thepublic could be informed that this subordination would take placeautomatically in areas affected by military operations. There was,however, a certain volume of opinion which favoured the immediategrant of increased powers to the military authorities, in suchmatters as the control of labour.The Prime Minister thought that the General Officers Com-manding-in-Chief of the Home Commands should have the rightto remove suspected persons from those parts of the defended area which lay within their commands.The Secretary of State for War said that figures which he had now obtained showed that, including the personnel employed bythe Ministry of Transport, 70,000 civilians were now employed on home Defence works. To this must be added 12,000 personnel inR.E. Companies. The siting of the defence lines had been a bottle-neck, but arrears in this respect had now been overtaken.The Prime Minister said that it was difficult to carry out this work over the whole country, but steps were now being taken tof Reference H.P. 6160.

Reference was made to the decision reached the previous day in regard to the issue of an instruction on the subject ofdefeatist talk.The War Cabinet :-(a) Invited each of the Service Ministers to issue a suitableinstruction to their own Services.(b) Took note that the Prime Minister would issue a circular to the Civil Departments.11. The Lord President of the Council reminded the WarCabinet that a further Memorandum had been sent to Mr. de Valera,setting on record certain modifications in the Memorandum of the26th June.* This further Memorandum had been sent to Eire on saturday, the 29th June, and the reply had been expected onMonday, the 1st July. He had made enquiries, and had been told that the Eire leaders were working on their reply, which they hoped to send in two or three days. He had gathered, however, that they didnot mean to accept our proposals. It looked as though the Govern-ment of Eire were taking the view that Germany was invincible.It might well be that, not only would they not be prepared to inviteour forces into Eire before a German invasion, but that if andwhen invasion took place their forces would offer no real resistance.He thought it his duty to report this to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Certain further discussion as to the defence of Ireland is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.France.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 190thConclusions,Minute 1.)12. The War Cabinet had before them copies of telegramssent as the result of the decisions reached on the previous day.In reply to a question by the Chief of Naval Staff, the PrimeMinister said that it was our policy to encourage any French sailors,who were willing to continue to fight for us, to do so.France.Members ofFrench civil and MilitaryMissions inLondon.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 190thConclusions,Minute 3.)13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that sir robert Vansittart&apos;s Committee, which had met that morning, had now submitted a report as to the action which should be taken.The main points in the scheme proposed were as follows : (a) Certain commissioned members of French naval, militaryand air missions were at once to be temporarilysegregated. This step was to be taken as a measure ofprecaution in preparation for a decision as to their future disposal. A list of the officers in question wasbeing compiled.(6) Segregation should take place in the most honourable andcomfortable conditions possible, with the proviso thatthe location of these officers was to be outside the london district.* See W.P. (40) 233.
(c) The French Charge d&apos;Affaires should be informed that HisMajesty&apos;s Government could no longer receive the naval,military and air attaches and their staffs in that capacity, and that their functions were terminated.This would dispose of the question of diplomaticprivilege.(d) A list was being prepared of the members of the Frenchcivil missions recommended for similar treatment tothat proposed for commissioned members of the french military, naval and air missions.(e) Accommodation was to be allocated at Cheltenham.  Officersof the armed forces would communicate the decision tothe members of the French naval, military, air and civilmissions selected for segregation, and convey them tothe place of accommodation selected.(/) The lists of persons to be segregated should be kept assmall as possible, but should include all those who were known or suspected to be opposed to the Allied cause.The War Cabinet :-Gave general approval to these recommendations, and directed that the action under (e) should be taken on the morning of Wednesday, the 3rd July.Richmond Terrace, S.

Mediterranean 882.__ Naval Cypher (F)__From Admiralty.IMMEDIATE AIDAOFollowing is the communication to be made to theFrench Admiral at Oran referred to in my 0103/2It His Majesty&apos;s Government have sent me to inform you as follows . They agreed to the Frenoh Government approaching the German Government only on the condition that before an armistice was concluded the French Fleet should be sent toBritisli ports to prevent it falling into the hands of theenemy.    The Council of Ministers declared on the 18th Junethat before capitulation on land the French Fleet   would join up with the British Navy or sink itself.3, Whilst the present French Government may considerthat the terms of their armisticeswith Germany and Italy arereconcileable with these undertakings, H.M.Government find it impossible from our previous experiences to believe thatGermany and Italy will not at any moment which suits themseize French warships and use them against Britain and her allies.    The Italian armistice prescribes that French ships should return to metropolitan ports and under the armisticeFrance is required to yield up units for coast defence andminesweeping.4. It is impossible for us, your comrades up till now,to allow your fine ships to fall into&apos;the power of the german or Italian enemy.   We are determined to fight on to the end,and if we win, as we think we shall, we shall never forgetthat France was our ally, that Dur interests are the same ashers, and that our common enemy is Germany(    Should weconyuer we solemnly declare that we shall restore thegreatness and territory of France.    For this purpose we mustmaice sure that the best ships of the French Wavy are not used against us by the common foe.5. In these circumstances H.M.Government have instructed me to demand that the French Fleet, now at MersEl Kebir, and Oran, shall act in accordance with one of thefollowing alternatives:-(a) Sail with us and continue to fight for victoryagainst the Germans and Italians.(b) Sail with reduced crews under our control to aBritish port.    The reduced crews will be repatriated at the earliest moment.If/y

If either of these courses is adopted by you, we will restore your ships to France at the conclusion of thewar, or pay full compensation if they are damaged meanwhile.(c) Alternatively if you feel bound to stipulate that your ships should not be used against the Germansor Italians unless these break the armistice, thensail them with us with reduced crews to some Frene:.:port in the Vest Indies, Martinique for instance,where they can be demilitarised to our satisfaction,or be perhaps entrusted to the United States.,, and remain safe till the end of tiie war?    the erewsbeing repatriated,.6. If you refuse these fair offers I must withprofound regret require you to sink your ships within sixhours.7. Finally failing the abo^e I have the orders ofH.M. Government to use whatever force may be necessary toprevent your ships from falling into German or Italian hands.0108/2Secretary to First Sea Lord.1st Lord.1st S.L.ControllerV.O.N.S.A.C.N.S.

AIDAC.My 0103/2.The following suggestions are merely intended to bea guide for your consideration in the event of a discussionarising and they are in no way to affect your orders,1.       On 18th June Darlan gave a personal promise to 1st lord and 1st Sea Lord that French Fleet would never surrender tothe enemy.2.        The French may argue that they will scuttle if Germansor Italians attempt to seize the ships even in Frenchmetropolitan ports.    But with French Army disarmed and theFleet laid up with reduced crews under German or Italiansurveillance,  there can he no certainty that, however resolutethe attempt to destroy or sink any particular ship? it wouldhe possible to forestall seizure by the enemy.3.       Officers and men of any units fighting on with uswill receive British rates of pay, pensions etc.h.       Our recent naval successes against the Italians showthat vigorous action which would be possible with continuedFrench collaboration would have greatest value in undermin-ing Italian will to fight.     We have now sunk or captured10 Italian submarines certain and 5 possible and sunk a destroyer -   all in about a fortnight.5.       It is a delusion to believe that France can be restored by co-operation with Axis.       Armistice terms arenot peace terms and Mein Kampf shows what treatment Hitlerhas in store for France.      Whatever is left to France, if anything, will only be held on sufferance until Germany isdefeated.      How much better therefore to fight on with us forrestoration of French Empire.6.       If French Admiral replies to first overture by sayingwe have no need to worry since all arrangements have beenmade, you should reply &quot;Mow can we be sure that this willbe effective?       You may be relieved from your command,pressure may be put on. families of ships companies and so-on.The ships companies may in any case be unwilling to scuttlein a French Port for fear- of immediate reprisals by theenemy. Therefore you must put your intentions intoeffect/
