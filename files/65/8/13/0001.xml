India.(previous reference: .W.M. (40) 135thConclusions,Minute 10.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 89thConclusions,Minute 10.)1.   The   War   Cabinet  had   before   them   the   following memoranda by the Secretary of State for India : W.P. (G.) (40) 173.W.P. (G.) (40) 176.The Secretary of State for India said that he hoped the WarCabinet would approve in principle the following measures  (a) The Viceroy&apos;s plan to invite representative Indians to joinhis Executive Council and to associate with them in a wider War Advisory Council (which would meet at regular intervals) representatives of the Indian Statesand of other interests in the national life of India asa whole.(b) The issue of a declaration on the general lines of thatappended to W.P. (G.) (40) 176.In the course of his statement, the Secretary of State made thefollowing points : (1) The resignation of the Provincial Ministries in the early days of the war had not had the bad results which hadbeen foretold at the time., The Provinces had been welladministered, and the situation had been accepted withcheerfulness by the population as a whole. The Moslemelement viewed the absence from office of the CongressMinisters with open satisfaction.(2) But all was not well beneath the surface. The rift betweenthe Hindu and the Moslem factions was widening.Mr. Jinnah&apos;s separatist programme was catching on with the Moslem masses, and there was real danger of adrift towards civil war. Competent judges, both indian and European, took the view that we were exposingourselves to the charge of insincerity by giving no indication of the time at which, or the methods by which,we intended to fulfil our promise of Dominion status.A feeling was abroad that we were relying on thecontinued absence of agreement between the two maincommunities to free us from the performance of ourpledges. Things in India were &quot; unpleasantlysimmering.&quot;(3) The Viceroy had been in agreement with the War cabinet when they had decided in the previous April to &quot; lieback &apos;&apos; for the time being, and not to make any construc-tive proposals. The immediate Indian reactions to military events in Europe had been better than mighthave been feared. Even the most extreme Indianpoliticians had realised that a Nazi victory would mean the end of all their dreams. The loyalist and moderateelements had been moved to make further offers of their services. These elements were disappointed that morewas not being done to enlist their support, while wewere vainly waiting for Congress to come into line. Inthis situation the Viceroy, without any prompting fromWhitehall, had decided that the time had come forfurther conversations with Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnah,to both of whom he had explained what he had in mindregarding the enlargement of his Executive Council, theestablishment of an Advisory War Council, and themaking of a new Constitutional Declaration.Mr, Jinnah had at first been eager to accept theViceroy&apos;s suggestions. Later, however, he had put histerms very high, and he might well back out.Mr. Gandhi had seen no harm in the proposed enlarge-
merit of the Executive Council, but had reacted violentlyagainst the proposed Declaration. He evidently feared that it might weaken the position of Congress.(4) The first draft of the Declaration, attached as appendix &quot; B &quot; to W.P. (G.) (40) 173, had been drawnup in Whitehall in the light of the Viceroy&apos;s latestconsultations with Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnah. A copyof this draft had been sent to the Viceroy, who had suggested a number of amendments, most of which hadbeen incorporated in the new text appended toW.P. (G.) (40) 176. This text might therefore beregarded as in accordance with the Viceroy&apos;s views.(5) The Provincial Governors had not actually seen thesedrafts, but had been made fully aware of the main headsof the Viceroy&apos;s proposals as affecting the centre andof what had passed between him and Mr. Gandhi andMr. Jinnah. They were all in favour of the Viceroy&apos;sproposals except in the Central Provinces, where the acting Governor had taken a different line. Most ofthe Governors were opposed to the idea of havingunofficial advisers in the provinces and not over-eagerfor the return of Congress Ministries, unless asCoWiffrVtfand pledged to help the war effort.(6) In the matter of the future constitution of India, the effectof the draft Declaration would be (a) To confer on India herself the right to frame that part of the Constitution which affected her alone.(b) To lay it down that India and Great Britain must provide in consultation for the responsibilities and obligations which fell upon His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.As regards (a), the method proposed was similar tothat by which the Constitutions of the british dominions had been drawn up.As regards (&amp;), the method suggested was a treaty or Instrument of Agreement between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the proposed constituent body, acting on behalf of the new Government of India. The treaty would be for a stated period of years, and would berenewable, and it would, for its duration, be embodied in the Indian Constitution as an integral part of thatConstitution, and would enter into force concurrently with it.(7) The Viceroy had laid considerable emphasis throughout onthe necessity for careful timing in connection with indian Constitutional developments. The timing of thepresent proposals came from the Viceroy himself, as did the last sentence of paragraph 4 of the revised Declara-tion, in which the hope was expressed that the newIndian Constitution would enter into force within a year of the conclusion of the war.The Prime Minister said that, in his view, there was no realprospect that Indians would agree on a Constitution. The morewe relaxed our control in India, the sharper would become theantagonism between Hindu and Moslem. The underlying trouble was that we were apt to deal with unrealities in India. Thus, inthis case we promised something when agreement had been reached between Indians, but we did not really believe that there was any chance of agreement being reached. Again, we proposed to rejectCongress&apos;s claim to dictate the future of India on the basis of amajority resting on adult suffrage. We did not adopt this attitude in regard to the other Dominions, but we had promised dominion status to India.
The Secretary of State for India said that the phrase&apos;&apos; Dominion status &apos;&apos; could be used in reference to either (a) the relation between the Dominion and this country, or (b) the internalform of Government of the Dominion. As regards (&amp;), it was clearthat the application of universal suffrage to India would lead to civil war, and that some other arrangement must be devised. Apartfrom the extremists in Congress, there were considerable elements,among Hindu and Moslem alike, who were already workingtogether. These people looked to us to help them to find a constitution which would meet their needs. He was satisfied thata Statement on the lines of his proposal would meet with wide-spread approval in India and would rally India&apos;s support for thewar. It would also have a great effect in the United States ofAmerica.The Lord President of the Council thought that certain partsof the revised draft Declaration went beyond Dominion status, ashe understood it. He referred, in particular, to the openingsentences of paragraph 3 and paragraph 5. The latter read asfollows : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to accept as thepermanent structure of the new Indian polity any constitutionalscheme that may be agreed by such a constituent body.&quot;He saw nothing in the draft to indicate that there were any limita-tions on the Constitution which India could suggest for herself,and there was no definition of what were India&apos;s own affairs. Itwas stated that Defence was to be regulated by an Instrument ofAgreement. But what would happen if India refused to make suchan Agreement?The Secretary of State for the Colonies supported theViceroy&apos;s proposals for expansion of the Executive Council. It was important that the Princes should not be represented on this Council,as it was a political body. He also supported the proposed war advisory Committee, which should consist, not of representativesof the people, but of prominent figures. He thought that it should include the Princes.As regards the draft Statement, there was nothing in theSecretary of State&apos;s Memorandum, or, indeed, in the Viceroy&apos;telegram, which indicated a strong desire for such a constitutionalannouncement, or any suggestion that grave consequences might result if the proposed announcement was withheld. On thecontrary, in paragraph 3 of the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandumthere was a reassuring picture of the conditions in India at themoment. He agreed with the Prime Minister that the prospects ofagreement by Indians on a Constitution were remote, but he deprecated offering Indians carte blanche in the framing of a Con-stitution, even though the possibility of their being able to secure agreement on one was remote. He was not afraid of action on thepart of the extremist element in Congress if no Declaration wasmade at this juncture. Indeed, he thought that discussion on con-stitutional matters was more likely to give rise to troubles than toassuage them. Generally, he thought it would be a great risk tomake a Statement on the lines proposed at the present time. he doubted if the Statement would conciliate any important element in India, but it would certainly give rise to alarm in many quarters.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs said that neither nownor in the past had he feared that we should be faced with graveinternal trouble in India if no immediate action was taken. india was economically prosperous.; Unless we were prepared to recognise that democraticinstitutions could take very different forms, we should find ourselves in a false position in India having regard to our previous announce-ments.
As regards the changes proposed in the Centre (the expansionof the Executive and the War Advisory Committee), he approved the proposals. As regards the Provinces, he deprecated any change.It was open to the Congress Ministries to return whenever they wished.As regards the constitutional problems, he agreed that our line of approach should distinguish between (1) matters on which agreement between Indians was essential, and (2) other matters inwhich we were justified in asserting our own rights or obligations.As regards (1) we should be prepared to accept a scheme agreedamong Indians, provided that we made it clear that we should not accept anything fantastic or fraudulent. It was also important tomake it clear that there were a number of internal Indian affairs in regard to which we had undertaken obligations.As regards the draft statement, he thought it would be a mistake to say anything which implied that a constituent assemblywas the right way of framing a constitution. He also thought thatthe construction of the statement was open to criticism.The Lord Chancellor said that he was influenced by the factthat the Viceroy, who on the last occasion when these matters hadbeen discussed in the War Cabinet had not favoured making any advance, had now reached the conclusion that certain steps shouldbe taken. He (the Lord Chancellor) favoured the expansion of theExecutive Council and the establishment of a War AdvisoryCommittee.As regards the proposed declaration, he would favour sucha statement, if he thought that it would make clear what we meantby Dominion Status in relation to India, and would free us fromthe accusation that we used phrases, but shrank from their meaning.But he could see no ground for hoping that a statement would produce these results; for example, if India was to have dominion status, the Princes must clearly be included. Again, when theCongress Party had met at Ramgarh in March last, they had passed a resolution to the effect that Dominion status was wholly inapplic-able to India and that they would accept nothing short of complete independence. It was difficult, therefore, to see how we could makeany statement which would reconcile the different parties in India.As regards the terms of the statement, he thought it was wrongthat it should contain only very mild references to a number of matters in which we were greatly interested and in respect ofwhich we had undertaken the clearest possible obligations, as, forexample, the interest of the scheduled castes.The Secretary of State for India said that both the viceroy and the Governor of Bombay thought that an explanation as to how we proposed to carry through Dominion status would satisfy themajority of Indians. It was of the utmost importance to makea Declaration which would rally moderate opinion to our side.The Minister without Portfolio agreed entirely with theproposals for an extended Executive Council and a War AdvisoryCommittee, which should be given effect to at once. If nothing morewas done and the position in India deteriorated, it would be unfortunate. On the other hand, if there was no likelihood of serious trouble in the near future, he thought there was much to besaid for the view that the present was not a good time for takingthe initiative in these constitutional matters.The Lord Privy Seal agreed as regards the extended ExecutiveCouncil and the War Advisory Committee. He thought that thedefence question could only be settled by the external defence ofIndia being recognised as a matter to be determined by the ImperialGovernment. This fitted in with the suggestion that certain matters should be dealt with in a treaty, which appealed to him.
The point of view that India should be governed by Indianideas had everything to commend it in theory. The trouble wasthat most of the ideas which governed Indian&apos; thought had been derived from this country and were inapplicable to India. All thesame, if Indians could be brought to face up to the problems involved, they might think out something for themselves. On thewhole, he favoured a Declaration which would deal with two points : First, the time at which the next advance in constitutionalform should be made; he favoured saying that we would make thisdirectly after the war. Secondly, there was the fact that there wasa great desire in India to assist our war effort. (This was connectedwith the use of Indian troops, on which sections of Indian opinionwere very sensitive.) He thought it was important to harness thisdesire to help our war effort. He would also like to see the congress ministries back at work in the Provinces. He thought it was important that the measures proposed to bring more Indians intothe Central Government should be coupled with the issue of aDeclaration.The Lord President of the Council said that he approved theproposed extension of the Executive Council, and the establish-ment of a War Advisory Committee, but not the suggested draft statement. He thought that this Statement was open to the criticism that it seemed to offer more than it did offer, and thatpassages in it were susceptible of different interpretations. He sawsome objection to having no Statement, although the Viceroy wasnot enthusiastically in favour of one. He suggested that theStatement should be redrafted on the lines of laying stress first onthe obligations which we had incurred in India and for which wemust retain responsibility. This would leave a field of purelyIndian affairs in regard to which we had no particular views,provided that the scheme proposed was workable and would dealfairly with minorities, &amp;c. He would like to see a revised draftprepared on these lines and shown to the Viceroy.The Secretary of State for India agreed that the statement would be greatly improved by this alteration.The Prime Minister doubted whether the present was a good time to make a far-reaching Declaration. First, many people who took an unduly gloomy view of the position would say that we hadno power to carry out the very large task envisaged in this declaration. Secondly, it would not be right, if it could be avoided,to take a step which led to a renewal in Parliament of the Indiandiscussions. He would prefer that we should make a hearteningDeclaration to India at a time when our growing strength was moreevident, and when such a step would be a generous gesture made from strength. The Declaration which he had in mind would state the real facts of the position clearly, and would invite theco-operation of all Indian people in bringing the war to a successful conclusion. He suggested that the Viceroy should be told that theextension of the Executive Council and the establishment of a war advisory Committee were approved; and that he should be invitedto consider the preparation of a further Declaration making clearthat we adhered to our existing promises and that there would beno avoidable delay in proceeding to make India a self-governingcountry.Discussion ensued whether the two practical measures proposedby the Viceroy should be accompanied by the issue of a Declaration.No final decision was taken on this point. It was agreed that thefirst step would be for the proposed Declaration to be redrafted onthe lines proposed, with a view to the Viceroy being consulted.
The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the expansion of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Counciland the setting up of a War Advisory Committee onthe lines sketched out in paragraphs 9 and 10 of telegram1187 S. of the 1st July from the Viceroy (Appendix&quot;A &quot; to W.P. (G.) (40) 173).(2) Did not approve the issue of a revised draft Statement onthe lines proposed in W.P. (G.) (40) 176. The Secretaryof State for India was invited to prepare a revised draft statement on the lines indicated in the discussion andto resubmit it to the War Cabinet.(3) Authorised the Secretary of State for India to informthe Viceroy of the decisions in (1), but not to announcethem. The Viceroy should be informed that a revised draft statement was being prepared and would be com-municated to him; and that he would then be askedwhether he favoured the issue of the revised draft state-ment, simultaneously with the announcement of theexpansion of his Executive Council and the establish-ment of a War Advisory Committee.2. The Permanent Undersecretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the Foreign Secretary was about to inform theFrench Embassy orally that we agreed that M. Paul Morand should remain here, when the French Embassy was closed, for the liquidation of economic and financial matters, in the capacity ofAgent of the French Government. It was proposed to say at thesame time that we should take steps to appoint an Agent of theBritish Government in France. That morning, however, it hadbeen announced in the newspapers that the French government intended to go to Paris or Versailles. He thought therefore thatany communication to the French Government in regard to thesematters should contain a reservation to the effect that it might benecessary for us to examine the matter again, in the event of theFrench Government moving to enemy-occupied territory.The War Cabinet agreed to this suggestion.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (40) 258) proposing thatdiscretion should be given to our West African Governors, to offer to the local French authorities in neighbouring French territories the same measure of coll on in maintaining the effectiveadministration of their territories as had already been approvedby the War Cabinet in the case of the French Cameroons.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that all that he asked for was to apply to other places in West Africa the measuresauthorised by the War Cabinet in regard to the Cameroons whichhad been very successful. If we delayed action there was a risk that the situation would deteriorate. The Governors would beinformed that for some time to come we should not be able tosend military assistance to West Africa.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that theWar Office anticipated no trouble from the steps proposed. It was true that the French out-numbered us in this area; but the numbersof troops were not large and they were already reducing their forces to a peace establishment.France.Anglo-french relations.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet-Approved the course proposed by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.Evacuation of 4    The War Cabinet had before them a revised draft of theChildren proposed Question and Answer regarding the Children&apos;s OverseasOverseas. Reception Scheme (W.P. (G.)

The Minister of Information said that he understood that itwas proposed that the Answer should be given on Tuesday, the16th July. The Press, both in this country and in America, wasfull of rumours, and plans were still being made. He favoured an earlier announcement if possible.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the Draft Answer prepared by the lord president of the Council, subject to the re-insertion ofthe paragraph in the previous draft which stated thatthere must be a postponement of the arrangementproposed in regard to schools.*(2) Agreed that the Answer should be given in Parliament on tuesday, the 16th July, as proposed, but that in themeantime the Minister of Information should beauthorised to give guidance to the Press on the lines ofthe draft Answer.(3) Invited the Departments concerned to supply the lord privy Seal with information on which to reply to supplementary Questions; and, in particular, to dealwith the allegation that the Governments decisions would not afford facilities for any children, other thanthose of the well-to-do, to be evacuated overseas.France.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 200thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Lord President of the Council drew attention to telegram No. 749 from Ankara, criticising a B.B.C. broadcast as tothe action taken by the Navy in regard to the Richelieu, which hadbeen described as one of the most brilliant exploits of the war. this had had a very bad effect on opinion in French circles in Turkey.The Minister of Information undertook to enquire into thismatter. Clearly, a broadcast on these lines should not have beengiven without prior consultation with the Admiralty.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 12, 1940.* A copy of the Question and Answer, as agreed, is attached as an Appendix.
APPENDIX.(See Minute 4.)Question: To ask the Lord Privy Seal whether he can give any furtherinformation about the progress of the Children&apos;s Overseas Reception Scheme.Answer: Yes, Sir. The House has already been made aware of the extremelygenerous offers for the reception and maintenance of British children duringthe war that have been made from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and theUnion of South Africa, and also from the United States of America. These offerswere already sufficient to account for a very substantial number of the childrenfor whom applications have been made under the Government Scheme, and Ihave no doubt that they by no means indicate the limit of the hospitality whichmight ultimately be made available overseas.In carrying out this Scheme, the Government would have no difficulty in providing the shipping required, as there is ample tonnage available. On theother hand, the Government feel strongly the responsibility that rests upon themto see that any children who go overseas under the Government Scheme shouldhave such naval protection as would reasonably ensure the safety of their passageduring the voyage. The fate of the Arandora Star shows that even a fastpassenger vessel cannot always rely for safety on her speed if she is unescorted.It is, however, in present circumstances essential to concentrate our wholenaval forces on the task of meeting the overriding demands of national security.It is this consideration alone which has forced the Government reluctantly tothe conclusion that they must postpone the operation of the scheme for the trans-ference of children overseas until the situation at sea enables them to providenaval escort for the ships employed for this purpose.Similarly, the Government feel that there must be a postponement of thespecial arrangements which they were prepared to make in cases where schoolshere had planned to transfer pupils to schools in Canada.Ordinary fast passenger vessels are not escorted and if children are carriedon such vessels outside any Government Scheme the responsibility for any riskson the voyage would not be on the Government. In any case, the numbers ofsuch children must be small, since I am bound to repeat that the imperativenecessity of conserving our dollar resources to meet other essential demands make sit impossible to allow the remittance of funds in any form for the purpose oftheir maintenance in Canada and the United States.The Government realise that the postponement of their Scheme, althoughinevitable, is bound to cause great disappointment among parents here, and alsoamongst those who in Canada and the Dominions have so wholeheartedlyco-operated in making preparations for the reception of the children. I desireto assure them that we keenly appreciate their generosity and deeply regret the inconvenience which the postponement of our Scheme is bound to cause them.To those also in the United States of America who have spared no effort to find a home for British children, I would like to express on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government our warmest thanks. I hope that our Scheme is onlytemporarily suspended and that we may yet be able to take advantage of thatwarmhearted hospitality so spontaneously and readily offered.
