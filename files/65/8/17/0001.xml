Parliament.House ofCommons(&quot;Vacation of seats) Bill.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 200thConclusions,Minute 12.)1. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (W.P. (G.) (40) 186) covering a draft Bill, preparedfor their consideration, declaring vacant the seats of Members ofParliament who absent themselves from this country without good cause for a specified period.The War Cabinet were informed that the Home PolicyCommittee, at their Meeting that morning, had been against theintroduction of the Bill.The view generally expressed by the War Cabinet was thatthe introduction of the Bill would result in attaching undueimportance to the two cases which had arisen.The War Cabinet-Decided that the Bill proposed should not be introduced.The Far East. 2.   The Foreign Secretary informed his colleagues of the(Previous following developments of the situation vis-a-vis Japan.Reference: (i) Tokyo telegram No. 1253 showed that Sir Robert CraigieW.M.

If it was M. Hiratore we should have to expect a definitely pro-Axis policy.(iv) Developments in the Military situation would determine whether Japan&apos;s attitude became more accommodatingor increasingly hostile.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Spain. 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that the situation vis-a-vis(Previous Spain was more hopeful.

France.Anglo-french relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 201stConclusions,Minute 2.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 193rdConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad seen the Marquis de Castellane on the previous day. Theprincipal points which had emerged from the conversation hadbeen as follows : (i) There was now a more hopeful outlook for Anglo-french relations as a result of the Prime Minister&apos;s broadcastspeech on the 14th July,(ii). Nevertheless there was little hope of full diplomatic relations between the two countries being resumed. TheFrench Government had indicated that they would haveto make such resumption subject to the fulfilment offive conditions, some of which were unacceptable.One condition which the Marquis de Castellane had mentioned was that we should agree to pay compensation to the wives and families of the French sailors who hadbeen killed at Oran. This we should be willing to do.Indeed, we had only decided not to make the offerspontaneously lest it should be misrepresented.(iii) The French Government agreed that a British agent tothe French Government should be appointed. He wouldhave the same status as the French Agent in London.(iv) The Marquis de Castellane had suggested that there might now be a modification of the present instructions toBritish and French forces in regard to firing on theaircraft of the other country.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.Middle East.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 200thConclusions,Minute 2.)Home Defence.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 198thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet a generalsummary of the present position in the Mediterranean and middle east and indicated a number of possible developments.It was important to keep the situation under review, and toensure that the position was vigorously handled.A Ministerial Committee had been set up under the Secretaryof State for War, to keep under review the conduct of the war inthe Middle East, and to report to the Minister of Defence(W.P. (40) 261).The Prime Minister also referred to the very gpreat progress which had been made in the past month in improving the defencesof this country against invasion. He had already visited severalsectors of our defences and was proposing to pay two furthervisits in the course of the present week. He expressed the hopethat other members of the War Cabinet would pay similar visits.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,July 16, 1940.
