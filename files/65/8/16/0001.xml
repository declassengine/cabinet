The Chief of the Air Staff gave the following information.Between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on the previous afternoon ourSquadrons had intercepted an attack on a Convoy off Dover. Sixenemy aircraft had been shot down confirmed and 2 unconfirmed.In addition, anti-aircraft defences had brought down 1 enemymachine. We had lost 1 Hurricane, the pilot of which had been saved. During this engagement the enemy had been using aHurricane.The previous night enemy activity had been slight, except forminelaying operations in the Thames Estuary and Harwich areas.Bombs had been dropped near Bristol, in the New Forest and in kent and Suffolk.Bomber On the night of the 13th/14th July, 111 of our bombers hadCommand. undertaken operations at Bremen, Gelsenkirchen, the Aluminiumworks at Grevenbroich, the Chemical works at Leverkusen, and anumber of aerodromes, with good results.On the night of 14th/15th July, 78 bombers had operatedagainst aerodromes, oil installations, aircraft factories and miscellaneous targets at Hamm, Soest and Cologne. All our machines had returned.Weather had interfered considerably with patrols in the north sea, but reconnaissances had been carried out off the Danish and norwegian coasts, and the whole of the Irish coastline had beenreconnoitred. Two of our aircraft had been lost, 1 running intoa balloon cable and 1 crashing for an unknown reason.The Chief of the Air Staff said that there were indications that attacks on convoys in the English Channel would be carriedout mainly when conditions were favourable to the attack.In discussion, the view was expressed that we should adhere to the policy of only routeing through the Channel coastal convoys,...  of vessels up to say 1,600 tons, which sailed every few days.Bomb dropped The Chief of Air Staff undertook to make enquiries regardingat Slough. the origin of a bomb which had recently been dropped on analuminium works near Slough.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.coastal command.Attacks on ourconvoys.Military 2.

The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat he bad received representations from all the Home Commandsthat the complete stoppage of leave was having a bad effect : hewould like to start leave again on a very limited scale.The War Cabinet-(a) Authorised the Secretary of State for War to resume thegrant of leave, on a very limited scale, to men stationed in this country.(6) Invited the Minister of Information to take special measures to ensure that the resumption of leave wasgiven no publicity.(previous reference:Minute 2.)The Far East. 5.   The Prime Minister drew attention to Tokyo telegramNo. 1236, in which Sir Robert Craigie reported that a Conferenceof Ministers had been held on the 12th July at which definitew m&quot;(4oV203rd decisions had been reached on the measures to be taken in the eventConclusions 0^ a British refusal. Mr. Arita had at first appeared disposed to reject our compromise, but the atmosphere had improved duringthe conversation and the final understanding had been perfectlyfriendly.In the course of discussion the following points were made :  (i) The Foreign Secretary thought that the danger of warwith Japan had passed for the time being,(ii) We had not heard the Japanese reply to Sir robert craigie&apos;s  request  that  the  importation  of  railway material into China should not be prohibited.(iii) The Chinese, who maintained that Uhey had been fightingour battles for months past, would take our decisionhardly. Public opinion might well be disturbed bothin this country and in the U.S.A.(iv) The New Zealand Government had been somewhatconcerned over our decision, but the commonwealth government had been relieved.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.United States.Relief inEurope.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Washington telegram No. 1339, in which Lord Lothian reportedthat he had asked Mr. Sumner Welles whether the United StatesGovernment had arrived at any conclusion about the problem of relief in Europe. Mr. Welles had said that both he and thePresident, together with the officials of the State Department, aswell as dominant American opinion, were strongly opposed to any action which would relieve the pressure on Germany by feeding the distressed people of Europe.
Evacuation of 7.   The Secretary of State far Foreign Affairs thought that,Children from the point of view of United States opinion, we ought to showOverseas. that our decision to postpone the Government scheme for the(Previous evacuation of children overseas had been reached in the light of a reference:        change in the situation.   He accordingly proposed the addition of w.M. (40) 201st the following passage at the beginning of the third paragraph of theConclusions,      Answer to be given on Tuesday, the 16th July : Minute 4.)&quot; Unfortunately, a radical change in the situation, sinceapplications were first invited, has occurred as a result of theloss of the services of a large part of the French Fleet. Inpresent circumstances, it is essential to concentrate,&quot; &amp;c.The First Lord of the A dmiralty agreed.Attention was also drawn to a wholly unfounded suggestionthat we were trying to fasten responsibility for the decision on theUnited States.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the amendment to the draft Answer set out at&quot;X&quot; above.(b) Invited the Foreign Secretary to take an opportunity of explaining to the American Ambassador the reasons which had led us to modify our decision.8. The War Cabinet again had before them a Memorandumby the Chairman of the French Forces (Official) Sub-Committee(W.P. (G.) (40) 181), covering-(a) A draft Agreement proposed by General de Gaulle dealingwith the rates of pay, conditions of service, &amp;c, of thevolunteers joining his forces.(b) The draft of a letter from the Prime Minister to general de Gaulle covering an alternative form of Agreement.The War Cabinet agreed that the concluding sentence of theletter, which it was suggested that the Prime Minister should write to General de Gaulle, went too far in undertaking to &quot; restore theindependence and territorial integrity of France and the French Empire.&quot; A new sentence should be substituted, expressing &quot; the determination of His Majesty&apos;s Government, when victory has been gained, that FYance should have restored to her her former greatnessand the independence which has been taken from her.&quot;Discussion ensued about the provisions of the Agreementdealing with pay. It was explained that the intention was,generally speaking, that General de Gaulle&apos;s forces should receivepay at the corresponding basic British rates, so long as general de Gaulle had his headquarters in this country.. If, however,General de Gaulle was to establish his headquarters in, say, someFrench colonial territory and continue operations on his own, adifferent arrangement might apply.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs feared that anarrangement whereby, for example, French Senegalese troopsreceived the rates of pay of British native troops would, at a later date, make serious difficulties for the French Government.It was explained that the Colonial Office had taken the viewthat, if French Colonial troops came into British Colonial terri-tories and joined our forces, as we were anxious that they should, itFrance.Proposed Agree-ment withGeneral de gaulle.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 202ndConclusions,Minute 1.)
would be very difficult to justify paying them at lower rates thanwere paid to British native troops; and that it would be invidiousto deny similar rates to General de Gaulle&apos;s native troops. In anyeventj the principles governing pay arrangements had been settledseparately in an interim Report by the French Forces (Official)Sub-Committee, the recommendations of which had receivedMinisterial approval.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that difficulties would arise if marriage allowances were paid to French Naval personnel,since their families were in France, and it would probably not bepossible to make remittances. The result would be that the Frenchpersonnel would be receiving rates of pay in excess of those ofBritish personnel.The War Cabinet were informed that arrangements were beingmade to deal with this point.The War Cabinet-Approved the draft letter from the Prime Minister toGeneral de Gaulle, and the draft Agreement with general de Gaulle, subject to the amendment of the concluding paper of the draft letter from the Prime minister referred to at &quot; X &quot; above.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 15, 1940.
