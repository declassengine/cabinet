Destroyer Imogenhad been as follows : H.M.S. glasgow: 2 missing.H.M. Destroyer Imogen: 1 killed 9 wounded, 17 missing.The Imogen had had to be abandoned, owing to the extent of the fire on board, and might have sunk. The Glasgow&apos;&apos;s bows had been damaged and would take about six weeks to repair.Alexandria had been bombed at about 11 p.m. on the 16th July.About 20 bombs had been dropped, one falling on Bas El Tin Palace,where one person had been killed and 2 injured. There had been no other damage or casualties.Twenty-seven survivors from the Greek S.S. la (4,860 tons) hadbeen picked up. It was thought that the ship had been torpedoed and sunk on the 12th July.On the 17th July, the Swedish S.S. Brodin (1,960 tons) had been torpedoed and sunk 20 miles north-west of the Orkneys.On the 17th July, the British S.S. Manipur (8,652 tons), in convoy, had been torpedoed off Cape Wrath. Sixty-four survivorshad been picked up.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.France.Use of french ships in british ports forrepatriatingFrench sailors.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (40) 202ndConclusions,Minute 2.)[21551]4. The War Cabinet were informed that 11,000 French sailors,now at Aintree, who had expressed a desire to be repatriated, were becoming very restive. Four French vessels now in British portscould be used for their repatriation, and could sail the following day. These vessels would have to make a second voyage to repatriatethe whole number of French sailors. There was a danger that ifthese French vessels once arrived at a French port, the french authorities would refuse to let them return.The War Cabinet were reminded that they had decided that negotiations should be entered into for the exchange of Frenchmerchant ships in British ports against British merchant ships in french ports on a ton-for-ton basis.b air Operations. 1.   The Chief of the Air Staff said that, owing largely to(Previous weather conditions, there had been little air activity.   We had reference: carried out a certain number of bombing and mine-laying operations.W.M. (40) 204th One Spitfire had been shot down whilst on patrol off Beachy Head.Conclusions, It was believed to have been shot down by a Spitfire captured by minute 1.)        the enemy.The German losses in the last two days amounted to two&quot; possibles.&quot;The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
The War Cabinet were also reminded that we had already-given an undertaking to repatriate to France French seamen whoso desired. It would take some time for the ships in question toreach a French port in unoccupied territory. In the meantime,negotiations for the exchange of French and British merchantvessels would continue, and these negotiations were unlikely to be prejudiced by the action taken to repatriate these French sailors in four French merchant ships.The War Cabinet: (1) Agreed that four French merchant ships now in our ports should be used for the immediate repatriation of aninstalment of the French sailors now at Aintree; and invited the Minister of Shipping and the First Lord ofthe Admiralty to make arrangements accordingly.(2) Invited the Minister of Shipping and the First Lord ofthe Admiralty, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, to expedite the negotiationsfor a general exchange of British merchant vessels in french ports with French merchant vessels in british ports, on a ton-for-ton basis.Holland.State of thetransportsystem underGermanoccupation.5. The Foreign Secretary said that a report had reached himthrough the Dutch Minister that there was still plenty to eat in holland. The reason was said to be the congested state of thetransport system; the Germans were finding it impossible to send the Dutch stocks of food into Germany.This appeared to show that our air attacks on the enemy&apos;stransport system were proving effective.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Far East. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that news(Previous na^ just  been  received from the Japanese Ambassador  that reference: M.

The War Cabinet had before them the fifth Report byLord Hankev&apos;s Committee on preventing oil from reaching Germany(W.P. (40) 266), together with the fourth Report by Mr. GeoffreyLloyd&apos;s Committee on the German Oil Position (W.P.

The Prime Minister said that he was still opposed to the dailypublication of exact number of air raid casualties. He saw noobjection to the casualties sustained in each locality being postedup in the Town Halls, but these lists should not be reproduced inthe local Press. The whole population of this country was now inthe front-line and should be treated in the same way as troops inthe field whose casualties were not announced daily. Further, dailypublication undoubtedly gave information to the enemy. He was willing, however, to agree to the publication of the total casualtiessustained in the previous fortnight or month. If the Cabinet agreed,he himself would put this view in answer to a Private notice question that afternoon. The matter was primarily one of defence and there was no reason why the Minister of Information should bear the bulk of the criticism in this matter.General agreement was expressed with the Prime Minister&apos;view, emphasis being laid on the importance of publishing the totalair raid casualties periodically.The Secretary of State for War said that there was a certainamount of anxiety amongst troops abroad as to the fate of relativesin this country as a result of air raids. He suggested thatCommanders-in-Chief abroad should inform troops under theirCommand that they would receive news by official cable if any nearrelatives became air raid casualties. For this purpose, they wouldbe asked to nominate two or three near relatives.The War Cabinet :-(a) Agreed that there was no objection to the air raid casualties in particular localities being posted up locally at thetown halls, but that the reproduction of these casualtylists in the local press should be forbidden.(b) Decided to adhere to the existing practice whereby reports in the press of casualties caused by air raids were statedin general terms and precise numbers killed and injuredwere not given.(c) Decided to combine with the existing practice a periodicalstatement (either fortnightly or monthly) of the totalair raid casualties sustained in the previous fortnightor month.(d) Invited the Prime Minister to make a statement in theHouse of Commons that afternoon on the above lines, in answer to a Private Notice Question.(e) Subject to examination of its practicability, favoured thesuggestion that members of H.M.

(40) 166thConclusions,Minute 11.)9. The Minister of Information said that the Inter-Depart-mental Committee, appointed by the War Cabinet at their meeting referred to in the margin, had met under the chairmanship of theLord President of the Council to consider proposals relating to compulsory censorship. The Committee considered. that the bestsuggestion to make to the Newspaper Proprietors Emergency Committee was that compulsory censorship should be dealt with bya Board of Censors. The Newspaper Proprietors Emergency Committee had, however, been unanimously opposed to this proposal.A different scheme, whereby all the existing Defence Notices wouldbe slightly amended and strengthened had then been put forward.Under this scheme it would be compulsory to submit to censorshipall matters dealt with in Defence Notices. Failure to do so wouldbe a punishable offence. The proposed scheme would, in fact, comevery close to complete compulsory censorship and, besides involving

(40) 166thConclusions,Minute 11.)9. The Minister of Information said that the Inter-Depart-mental Committee, appointed by the War Cabinet at their meeting referred to in the margin, had met under the chairmanship of theLord President of the Council to consider proposals relating to compulsory censorship. The Committee considered that the bestsuggestion to make to the Newspaper Proprietors Emergency Committee was that compulsory censorship should be dealt with bya Board of Censors. The Newspaper Proprietors Emergency Committee had, however, been unanimously opposed to this proposal.A different scheme, whereby all the existing Defence Notices wouldbe slightly amended and strengthened had then been put forward.Under this scheme it would be compulsory to submit to censorshipall matters dealt with in Defence Notices. Failure to do so wouldbe a punishable offence. The proposed scheme would, in fact, comevery close to complete compulsory censorship and, besides involving
&quot;A&quot;&quot;B&quot;a large increase in the staff of the Ministry of Information andmeeting with opposition from the Press, would not be a great improvement on the old scheme.The Minister said that he had therefore reached the conclusionthat the best course would be to issue a new set of Defence Notices,extended in scope and peremptory in form, but leaving the voluntary system in force. Although in the past there had been few prosecu-tions for breaches of the law in regard to censorship, this had been partly due to the reluctance of the Defence Departments to under-take prosecutions. He suggested, therefore, that the Minister ofInformation should in future be responsible for deciding whetheror not a breach of the Defence Notices should be sent to the Directorof Public Prosecutions. If the &quot;War Cabinet agreed to this course,he would set up a department of scrutineers in his Ministry, whose duty it would be to search the Press for breaches of the Regulations.The Minister of Information added that he also proposedto have in readiness a Bill giving the Ministry of Informationpower, in the event of invasion, to compel the Press to publish onlyinformation derived from official communiques or agency messageswhich had been passed and censored.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the proposals of the Minister of Information inregard to censorship outlined at &quot; A &quot; above.(b) Agreed that the Minister of Information should prepare a Bill on the lines suggested by him at &quot; B &quot; above,but that the Bill should not be introduced in Parliamentwithout further reference to the War Cabinet.(c) Invited the Minister of Information to submit a draft ofhis proposals at &quot; A &quot; to the Prime Minister and to consult with the latter as to which Minister should announce them.Bread. 10.   The Minister of Food said that it was generally agreedthat bread from flour of 73 per cent, extraction excluded manyingredients essential to the health of man; in particular, vitamin B 1and iron. All wheaten bread was deficient in calcium. Thearguments in favour of extracting 80 per cent, of wheat were wellknown, but only a small fraction of the public would eat brownbread if they could get white bread.A scientific Sub-Committee of the Food Policy Committee,under the Chairmanship of the President of the Royal Society, after careful examination had recommended : (a) That the advantage of 80 per cent, extraction should bemade known to the public.(b) That bread made of white flour of 73 per cent, extraction -should contain an admixture of vitamin B and calciumsalts.This would be greatly beneficial to health. So far as taste went,the public would not notice any difference. The Food PolicyCommittee had agreed with this view and had approved action onthese lines.It so happened that the Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Food had, until taking up his present office,&apos; been a director of the Company which manufactured these syntheticvitamins. On taking up his present office he had, of course, relinquished-quished his Directorship and severed his financial interest in theCompany.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the draft of a personal statement by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry..
IllFood Rationing. 11. A short discussion ensued on the question whether theTea     0 tea ration involved particular hardship for poor people.(Previous The Minister of Food said that he had mo desire to extendReference:        measures of rationing.   The last measures of rationing introducedW.M. (40) 197th had been of a precautionary nature.   Tea stocks, in particular,Conclusions,      had got very low.   When stocks had been built up, he hoped to be minute 12.)      able to agree to a more generous ration, while retaining the rationing of this commodity to meet any further period of shortage.   he undertook to send the Prime Minister his observations on a Note,prepared by the Prime Minister&apos;s Statistical Department, as tothe effects of the 2-oz ration.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Enemy Aliens(previous reference:W.M. (40)206thConclusionsMinute 1.)A&quot;12. The Lord President of the Council referred to thediscussion at the Cabinet on the previous day, when it had been stated that the present policy with regard to the internment of category &quot;C&quot; aliens was that the release of such aliens from internment could only be justified to the extent that the services which they could render to the State outweighed the potential danger of their being at large. A large number of complaints had reached him as to the position of internment camps, which disturbedhim greatly. For example, there had been cases where it had been impossible to find out for several weeks in which camp a particularalien had been interned, with the result that some members of a family had been sent abroad while another member had remained in this country. Again there were cases of chronic invalids and people suffering from diabetes and tuberculosis who had been putinto internment camps. Other reports reached him of internees notbeing provided with soap or bedding. He thought that the viewreferred to at &quot;A&quot; above, which broadly speaking governed thepolicy as to the internment of enemy aliens at the present time,should be amended.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said that instructions issued to the police to govern their action in interningaliens had been subject to a number of conditions, one of whichhad been that invalids should not be interned. In the rush of themoment, however, it was clear that these instructions had not beenfully carried out. It was also true that the War Office had been at their wits&apos; end to find accommodation.The War Cabinet agreed as follows :   &apos; -(i) The conditions at present governing the release from internment of enemy aliens summarised at &quot; A &quot; above should be revised, so as to ensure that persons who were known to be actively hostile to the present regime inGermany or Italy, or whom for other sufficient reasons it was undesirable to keep in internment, should be released.(ii) The internal management, though not the safeguarding,of the internment oamps should be transferred from theSecretary of State for War to the Secretary of Statefor the Home Department.It was agreed that there could be no possible ground forcriticism of the position of the Parliamentary Secretary in thismatter, or of the action proposed. The Ministry of Food proposedto take over the Company for the period of the war.The War Cabinet approved the action proposed.
(iii) The Lord Privy Seal was invited to take (i) and (ii) intoaccount in the revised memorandum which he was preparing for the War Cabinet.(Previous (iv) The Secretary of State for Home Affairs was invited to reference: arrange for an enquiry as to the selection of aliens for w.M. (40) 192nd deportation on the A randora Star.Conclusions,Minute 12.)Parliament.Proposedanswers tocertainParliamentary-Questions.13. The War Cabinet considered the replies to be given toa number of Parliamentary Questions to be answered by the PrimeMinister that afternoon, dealing with the following matters: (a) Evacuation of children overseas.(b) Preparation of official quarters for the Foreign secretary in the Foreign Office.(c) The suggestion that on an early day the people of the UnitedKingdom should be called to a Day of Prayer andDedication.The proposed answers to these Questions were read and approved.The Far East. 14.   The War Cabinet considered the draft of a statement to(Previous be made by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary in reference: Parliament that afternoon.C^nciusions06th Subject to drafting amendments, the statement was approved.Minute 2.)Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 18, 1940.
