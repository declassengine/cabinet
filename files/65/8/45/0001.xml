The Prime Minister said that he hoped that the questionwhether certain flying training schools should be sent overseaswould be i&quot;eady for discussion by the War Cabinet on Monday next.As a result of a Meeting of the Defence Committee that morning, ithad been decided that certain points required further investigationbefore a decision could be taken.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Home Defence. 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a Minute by the PrimeMilitary Minister and the observations thereon of the Chiefs of Staffdispositions.        (W.P. (40) 319).(Previous The Prime Minister said that the War Cabinet would see that reference: his views on this matter coincided almost exactly with those of theW.M. (40) 205th Chiefs of Staff.Conclusions, The Prime Minister said it was important to have as large a minute 5.) proportion as possible of highly-trained troops in mobile reserve,and he suggested that the Secretary of State for War should consider moving the First Division from the Coastal Area intomobile reserve.The Secretary of State for War undertook that this point would be considered. He gave particulars of the progress madewith the formation and training of new battalions, which wouldrelieve the Field Army of positions which they at present had toguard, and free them for a more mobile role.Vulnerable The Prime Minister said that he thought that Lieutenant-Points Adviser.   General Barker, who had recently been appointed Adviser onVulnerable Points, should be responsible to himself as Minister ofDefence.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the policy set out in W.P. (40) 319.(b) Agreed that the Adviser on Vulnerable Points should beresponsible to the Prime Minister as Minister ofDefence. .Middle East.Directive to theCommander-in-Chief.(previous reference:W.M.

(40) 330) covering a General Directive to theCommander-in-Chief, Middle East, which had been drawn up inconsultation with the Chiefs of Staff and despatched to general wavell by telegram.A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet-Approved the General Directive to the Commander-in-Chief,    Middle    East,    circulated    under    cover    of w.P. (40) 330.[21680]
4. The Rome Secretary reminded the War Cabinet that onthe 5th August they had invited him, in consultation with theSecretary of State for War, to redraft paragraph 4 (c) of theinstructions to the Police in the event of invasion. His difficulty was that the instructions to the Police clearly depended on theinstructions to the general public, as to which, there seemed to be some doubt. On the 26th. July the War Cabinet had approved aleaflet, which had since been very widely distributed under the title : &quot; Stay where you are &quot; (W.P. (G.) (40) 197).The relevant passage in this leaflet, which had been based onthe view of the military authorities, was : &quot; . . . . Civilians who try to join in the fight are more likely to get in the way than to help. The defeat of an enemy-attack is the task of the armed forces, which include the home guard, so, if you wish to fight, enrol in the Home Guard.....If fighting by organised forces is going on in your district and you have no special duties elsewhere, go to your shelter andstav there until the battle is past. Do not attempt to join inthe fight.....&quot;The Prime Minister said that his view of the Cabinet decisionto which the Home Secretary had referred was that we did not contemplate or countenance fighting by persons not in the armed forces, but that we did not forbid it. What he had had in mind was that the police, and, he hoped, the A.R.P. services, could be divided into combatant and non-combatant branches, armed andunarmed; those armed would co-operate actively in fighting withthe Home Guard and Regulars in their neighbourhood, and would withdraw with them if necessary; the unarmed would assist in the&quot; stay put &quot; policy for civilians. Should they fall into an areaeffectively occupied by the enemy, they might surrender and submitwith the rest of the inhabitants, but must in no circumstances give any aid to the enemy in maintaining order, or in any other way.They should, however, assist the civil population as far as possible.As regards the civil population, the order was &quot; not to join inthe fight.&quot; Nevertheless, the citizen retained his natural right tofight in defence of his family and his home. This might well resultin civilians joining in the fight in support of the military. If this happened, the Government would certainly not desire to punishthose responsible.The Home Secretary said that the question of dividing A.R.P.personnel, A.F.S. personnel and other similar workers intocombatant and non-combatant was likely to present serious difficulties. An invasion was likely to be accompanied by a severeair bombardment, in which case these workers would be very fully occupied in their primary jobs. Their work was far more dangerous than mere ambulance work, and those engaged on it ought not to be encouraged to leave their posts to undertake sporadicfighting. The Home Secretary referred to the good account whichthe auxiliary fire-fighting services had recently given of themselves at Leigh-on-Sea and at Pembroke Dock.The Secretary of State for War said that the view of theCommander-in-Chief, whom he had consulted, was that the A.R.P.personnel would be fully occupied in their own jobs and should notbe employed as combatants.The Lord Privy Seal said that it would be the duty of these workers to assist in repelling the invader when they were notrequired in their primary jobs.The Home Secretary said that the discussion had given him the guidance he required to prepare a revised draft of the instructionsto the Police. It was largely a matter of obtaining the rightemphasis.Home Defence.Functions of thepolice in theevent of invasion.(previous references:W.M. (40) 213thConclusions,Minute 10,and 219thConclusions,Minute 10.)
The War Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to submit to the War cabinet a revised draft of paragraph 4 (c) of the instructions tothe Police in the event of invasion.Civil Defence.A.R.P. and fire-fightingPersonnel.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 193rdConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Prime Minister asked whether the number of paidpersonnel in the A.R.P., fire-fighting and other emergency services could be reduced.The Home Secretary said that this would need careful reviewas winter came on. It would, of course, require the spare time oftwo or three volunteers to carry out the duties of one paid man.The Home Secretary recalled the fact that in the winter of 1939-40there had been a reduction by as much as 50 per cent, in the numbersof paid personnel. In some areas the reduction had been even greater.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.6.   The War Cabinet had before them (a) A Memorandum by the Minister of Information (W.P. (40)322) submitting a scheme for the further examinationof the ideas which he had outlined in his Paper W.P. (40)275 on Propaganda for the Future.(b) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (W.P. (40) 332) suggesting amended Terms ofEeference to the Ministerial Committee proposed by theMinister of Information.It was agreed that there was a growing demand for some statement of what we were fighting for. We must make our aimsclear, not merely to our own people, but also to the peoples ofEurope whom we were trying to free. In effect, Hitler said that,provided people were prepared to do without liberty and to sacrificenationality, he could give tJhem a good life. A time would come when it would be generally realised that this country was not onlycapable of maintaining the fight alone, but afforded the only realhope for the future. That would be the moment to &quot;put across&quot;our conception of the new Europe. It was thought that there wasin fact a considerable measure of agreement between members ofall political parties, but time would be required to work out anadequate statement.The Prime Minister outlined some of the points which hethought would be included in the scheme proposed. In addition tothe five Great Powers of Europe, there should be three groups of smaller States in Northern Europe, in Middle Europe, and in the balkans. He also looked to see the five great nations and these three confederations linked together in some kind of Council ofEurope. There should be a Court to which all justiciable disputesshould be referred, with an international air force. There must bea scheme for a fair distribution of raw materials. It was also important that there should be no attempt at a vindictive settlementafter the war.The Prime Minister said that, while he agreed with the composition of the Ministerial Committee proposed, he appreciated that several of the Ministers concerned would not be able to givemuch time to this task. Some delegation of duties would thereforebe necessary.Propaganda.Future Policy.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 213thConclusions,Minute 12.)
The War Cabinet-Agreed that a Committee should be set up, comprising The Lord President of the Council,The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for Air,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Minister of Labour and National Service,The Minister of Information With the following terms of reference : (1) To make suggestions in regard to a post-war european and world system, with particular regard to theeconomic needs of the various nations, and to the. problem of adjusting the free life of small countriesin a durable international order.(2) To consider means of perpetuating the national unityachieved in this country during the war through a social and economic structure designed to secureequality of opportunity and service among all classesof the community:and to report to the War Cabinet.Foreign Affairs.Japan.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 222ndConclusions,Minute 2.)Italy Greece.(previous reference:W,M (40) 232ndConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Foreign Secretary said that relations with Japan were somewhat improved.The relations between Italy and Greece seemed to havedeteriorated further. On the previous day the President of theCouncil had enquired of our Minister at Athens what help we wouldgive if Greece was attacked by the Italians, as he feared might happen in the next few days (telegram No. 727 from Athens). Onthe other hand, opinion in Turkey still seemed to be that italy would not attack Greece. It looked rather as though, if Italyattacked Greece, Turkey would not enter the war. A telegram hadbeen received from our Ambassador in Angora (No. 1037) arguing that in present circumstances Turkey would be more of a liabilitythan an asset as a co-belligerent.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 232ndConclusions,Minute 1.)8. The War Cabinet were informed that an eastbound Channelconvoy had been shelled by an enemy battery on the previousmorning. There had been several near misses, but. no damage hadbeen inflicted. We had fired a few shells in return. This mightaccount for the shelling of Dover, which had taken place later theprevious night. The War Cabinet were informed of the counter-measures proposed.
