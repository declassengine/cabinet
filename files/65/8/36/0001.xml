1. The Chief of the Air Staff said that the following enemyraids had taken place on the previous day : (i) At 10-30 the previous morning five raids had startedagainst Portland and Weymouth on a twenty-mile front,in which 200 enemy machines had taken part, of which150 had crossed the coast. This raid had been met byseven of our fighter squadrons,(ii) Four attacks had been made on the Dover balloon barrage,resulting in the destruction of seven balloons,(iii) Attacks by two waves of 100 enemy aircraft had been madeon convoys in the Thames Estuary without any damage to shipping.The air casualties were estimated as follows : Our own 20 Hurricanes.5 Spitfires.Enemy Approximately 60 (certain).It was thought that two or three of our pilots had been saved.The Chief of the Air Staff added that a number of enemy raids were in progress at that moment, including one at Portsmouth, butdetailed information was not available.The First Sea Lord said the damage in the Portland raid had resulted in three destroyers, one M.L., one mine-sweeper and fivemerchant ships being slightly damaged. A number of bombs hadbeen dropped in the dockyard, causing a certain amount of damage.Military The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported the latestOperations: information in regard to the situation in Somaliland and undertookSomaliland. to report to the Prime Minister regarding the supply of anti-tank(Previous weapons to our forces in that area.Reference:W.M. (40) 221stConclusions,Minute 2.)Naval The First Sea Lord reported certain movements in regard too operations.       the Mediterranean Fleet.(Previous The Wap Cabinet took note of these statements.Reference:W.M. (40) 222ndConclusions,Minute 1.) _2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that telegrams(Nos. 231, 239 and 240) had been received from Tangier suggesting that the French might attempt to send a convoy from Casablancato Marseilles and another from Toulon outward bound from theMediterranean. These convoys might or might not be escorted by French warships. It was suggested in one of these telegramsthat, if either of these convoys was stopped at Gibraltar or byBritish Naval patrols, a bombardment of Gibraltar would immediately take place by the French Moroccan air force.Admiralty instructions issued on the 11th July laid down thatfor the present French ships, if escorted, should not be interfered with, but if unescorted should be brought into our contraband control stations.The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the despatch of these convoys might well be a ruse to involve us in an incident which would give the French an excuse for attacking Gibraltar by air.Naval, Militaryand air operations.Air Operations.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet agreed That, if these convoys were escorted, they should hot beinterfered with. If unescorted, they should be subject tothe normal contraband control measures.BritishNationalityBill.Proposed grantof british nationality to french citizensserving theAllied cause.(previous reference:W.M. (4.0) 192ndConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Home Affairs (W.P. (G.) (40) 212) covering the draft of a Bill to provide special facilities for the grant ofBritish nationality to French nationals who were giving service to the Allied cause, notwithstanding that the residence qualifica-tion of live years had not been complied Avith.The Home Secretary explained that the Bill gave effect to the pledge which had been given to General de Gaulle on behalf of theGovernment. When the matter had come before the Home PolicyCommittee, the view had been expressed that the Bill was likely tobe criticised on the ground that the privilege should not be confined to Frenchmen, but should be given, for example, to refugees fromGermany and Austria who were fighting for us. Hitherto our policy had always been that German refugees were sojourners inthis country, until such time as we were able to bring about achange in the conditions in Germany which would enable them toreturn there.Pressure might also be brought to bear on behalf of, say,Dutchmen who were fighting for us. On this, the Home Secretary&apos;view was that it would be undesirable to confer British nationalityon the citizens of the exiled Governments now in this country.The Secretary of. State for Dominion Affairs said that, ifClause 5 (2) of the draft Bill was retained, it would be for theDominions to settle whether they would pass correspondinglegislation.The Dominions had been consulted on the matter, and so faronly one reply had been received, namely, from the Union Govern1ment, saying that they did not propose to take corresponding action.The Bill involved a breach in the conception of british nationality as being of equal validity throughout the Empire, andmight encourage Dominion Governments to legislate separately onNationality matters. Nevertheless, he thought that Clause 5 (2)should be included in the Bill.The Prime Minister said that he thought the Bill should beintroduced on the lines proposed, i.e., restricted to French nationalswho were giving their service to the Allied cause. If strong pressuredeveloped to extend the scope of the Bill, the matter could befurther examined. In the meantime, he saw no reason why the Billshould be introduced before the House adjourned.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the draft Bill appended to theMemorandum by the Home Secretary.(2) Agreed that the introduction of the Bill should be deferred until the autumn.parliamentary business.4.   The following arrangements were agreed upon : (1) The Prime Minister would make a statement on the progressof the war on Tuesday, the 20th August.  This statement would be followed by an open debate.(2) An opportunity for a debate on Aliens matters could begiven on the Motion for the Adjournment of the house on Thursday, the 22nd August.
(Previous (3) An opportunity might be allowed for the question ofEeferenoe: Lord Swinton&apos;s Committee (Home Defence SecurityW.M. (40) 144th Executive) to be raised on Thursday, the 15th August, &quot;Conclusions,Minute 7.)Aliens- 5.   The War Cabinet were reminded that on the 22nd July it(Previous had been agreed that an Inquiry should be made as to the selectionReference: of aliens for deportation on the Arandora Star and as to theW.M. (40) 218th conditions prevailing at Huyton Camp.   It was proposed that this conclusions, Inquiry should be carried out by Lord Snell.minute 2.) After a short discussion the War Cabinet (1) Agreed that Lord Snell should be invited to carry out the inquiry into the Arandora Star, with the following-Terms of Reference :  &quot; The method of selection of aliens to be sent overseas in the Arandora Star; whether the actualselection of individuals was in accordance with themethod determined; and generally the responsibility forthe action taken.&quot;(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to arrange for a departmental Inquiry to be held into conditions atHuyton Camp prior to the transfer of responsibility tothe Home Office, and to report to the War Cabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.
