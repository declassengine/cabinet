naval operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 207thConclusions,Minute 3.)TheMediterranean.MilitaryOperations.The middle east.1. The War Cabinet were informed that H.M.A.S. Sydneyhad sunk an Italian cruiser off the North Coast of Crete, and wasin pursuit of another Italian cruiser.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.2. The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet particulars inregard to certain possible developments in the Mediterranean area,which were under consideration by the Chiefs of Staff.The Prime Minister also explained various measures proposed for the defence of the West Coast against invasion.Military 3.   The War Cabinet approved the proposal that the SecretaryAppointment. of State for War should recommend to His Majesty that Lieut-General Sir A. F. Brooke should be appointed Commander-in-Chief,Home Forces, in succession to General Sir Edmund Ironside.France. 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionPublic opinion, to Berne telegram No. 435, in which Mr. Kelly gave an accountof a conversation with M. de Neyrac, a member of the Press Depart-ment of the French Embassy. According to M. de Neyrac theFrench people were beginning to realise that they had been duped.If French opinion was handled rightly, there might well be a con-siderable reaction.Effect of our In this connection the Foreign Secretary remarked that weblockade on must expect shortly to be held up to the execration of the Worldpublic opinion, as the Power responsible for starving parts of Europe (includingvery possibly France) at a time when North and South America hadlarge surpluses of food-stuffs, which they were unable to sell. Weshould have some difficult decisions to take. He intended to have a preliminary discussion with the Minister of Economic Warfare onthese problems at an early date.In discussion, reference was made to the possibility of devisingmachinery, for enabling food-stuffs to be sent to certain parts of- Europe, under safeguards against transmission to Germany. It was,however, difficult to see how this could be done without some damage to our interests. In any event, the situation envisaged belonged tothe next phase of the war, and it would be premature to take any decision on it at present.The War Cabinet took note of this discussion.5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had seen Dr. Weizmann, who had formulated&apos; a proposal for the recruit-ment of Jewish man-power in Palestine.   He was prepared for theW.M. (40) 192nd simultaneous recruitment of loyal Arabs in Palestine, probably in conclusions,      separate units in the same divisions.   He proposed to discuss this minute 10.)       scheme, which looked promising, with the Secretary of State for theColonies and the Secretary of State for War.Palestine.(previous reference:
Eire.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 195thConclusions,Minute 11.)6. The Lord President of the Council gave the War Cabinetthe latest information in regard to the position in Eire. It was evident that the atmosphere between this country and Eire had greatly deteriorated in recent weeks, mainly on account of suspicionsentertained in Eire that we had planned to occupy that country by force at an early date. In a recent conversation with Mr. de valera, Sir John Maffey had been able to go some way to removethese suspicions. It was clear that if we furnished Eire withcertain equipment which would enable her to put up a more effectivedefence against an invasion by Germany, this would greatly help toremove suspicions. The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs would shortly be circulating a Paper putting forward suggestionson these lines.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Poland. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatcertain difficulties had arisen between the Polish Ministers andGeneral Sikorski. He had seen our Minister to Poland, and had instructed him to make it clear to those concerned that we regarded it as essential that these difficulties should be amicably settled.Polish Forces. The Prime Minister read a message that he had received from(Previous General Sikorski to the effect that 1,900 Polish airmen, 800 PolishReference:        pilots, and 400 men of a mechanised division, with their equipment,W.M. (40) 184th had reached Glasgow from Casablanca.   It was also reported that conclusions,      30,000 Polish troops in France, previously believed to have been minute 7.)        forced to surrender, had succeeded in making their way intounoccupied French territory.  It was hoped that these troops wouldbe sent by sea to Morocco, and could thence be brought to thiscountry.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Proposed 8.   The Lord Privy Seal said that he had had discussionsFormation of a with Sir William Beveridge and certain Oxford dons, who reportedYouth Force. that there were a number of young men, below the age for&quot; militaryservice, who felt that they had insufficient opportunities for nationalservice. There was no point in these young men going to theUniversity, or in taking up some specialised training, for a fewmonths. It was proposed to form a Youth Force for young menso situated and to form an organisation to find suitable employment for members of this Force. If employed in a paid job, they would receive the pay of the job; but the general intention was that theyshould live rough, and be provided with their food, and should beemployed in such jobs as, for example, clearing land for agricultural purposes.The War Cabinet was favourably impressed with the need fora scheme on these lines, and invited the Lord Privy Seal, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, to arrange for thepreparation of a detailed scheme, which should be submitted tothe War Cabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1, IJuly 19, 1940.
