The Foreign Secretary reported that he had had an interview with the Japanese Ambassador on the same subject.The Foreign Secretary suggested that, if within two or three days matters were not moving towards the release of the Britishsubjects who had been arrested in Japan, we should proceed, as ameasure of reprisal, to seize ten or twelve Japanese subjects, eitherhere or in the Far East. As a first step he would ascertain sir robert Craigie&apos;s views on this suggestion, and he would report further to the War Cabinet before taking action on these lines.The War Cabinet took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement.Spain. 4.

(40) 191st voluntarily.   The United States Government had refused to grantConclusions, a visa to Dr. Negrin, and it was now proposed to encourage him to minute 7.) &apos; go to Mexico.In discussion, it was pointed out that Dr. Negrin might notbe willing to go to Mexico, and that the Spanish Government seemedto be less concerned about his presence in this country than whenthe matter had first been raised.The War Cabinet agreed that, if Dr. Negrin was willing to goto Mexico, this would be a solution of the difficulty. If, however,he was unwilling to go, the matter should not be pressed. In this event, if the Spanish Government returned to the charge, we should say that we had suggested that Dr. Negrin should go to another country, but that the country in question had not been willingto receive him; and we should remind the Spanish Government that dr. Negrin was not allowed to engage in any political activity while in this country.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,July 30, 1940.
