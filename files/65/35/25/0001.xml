Eightenemy fighters had been destroyed.       - ,.,American heavy bombers had carried out a fairly successfulraid on synthetic oil targets in the Ruhr. Twenty-five aircraft hadbeen lost out of 325.. Total American claims for the week39 enemy aircraft destroyed, 10 probable, 20 damaged.&apos;Coastal Command had had a rather disappointing week,resulting in 5 sightings, 1 abortive attack and 9 aircraft lost, mainlyas a result of increased enemy air activity over the Bay of Biscay.Fighter Command claimed 21 enemy aircraft destroyed,3 probable and 12 damaged for 10 fighters lost.On the 13th August a strong force of Fortresses and medium bombers had again attacked railway yards and the Littorio airfieldin Rome.On the 13th August Liberators from North Africa had attacked the aircraft factory at Vienna/Neustadt, the total round trip being over 2,000 miles.Allied air activity in support of the battle in Sicily had remained high and there had been an increased, scale of eneriry air activity, mainly against the Sicilian ports.Snipping losses by enemy action during the previous week(including belated reports) amounted to 45,600 tons, (There had been few U-boat sightings in the North Atlantic, butthe United States aircraft-carrier Card claimed 3; U-boats sunkduring the week in the Azores area. A Liberator had sunk a U-boat off Freetown, but had been shot down by the submarine and the crewlost. U-boat activity continued in the Madagascar area.Enemy aircraft had attacked a large convoy in the Bay of biscay.  One ship had been sunk and 2 damaged by near misses.Other enemy, aircraft had carried out a torpedo attack on a mediterranean convoy near Gibraltar. Two ships had been torpedoed but had reached Gibraltar. The convoy claimed to have destroyed 7 enemy aircraft.Our light craft had been active in the Messina Straits and were taking a toll of the enemy evacuation in difficult circumstances andin face of powerful coast defences.The 8th and 7th Armies were closing in on Messina, andGeneral Eisenhower expected to clear the tip within the next twoor three days.The German evacuation was in full swing. It was estimatedthat about 32,000 Germans and Italians had got across the Straits,Which were covered by some 500 A.A. guns.Estimates of casualties in the 8th Army up to the 10th Augustwere nearly 2,000 killed, 8,000 wounded and 2,700 missing(excluding 1st Airborne Division, in which casualties were estimated to be about 1,000).The news from Russia continued satisfactory. There was as yet no confirmation of reported Russian attacks south of lake ladoga. A new offensive had been opened south-west of Viasma.There had been steady progress in the Bryansk sector. The Russiansclaimed to have repulsed strong German counter-attacks nearKharkov and were now 30 miles from Poltava.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Italy. 2.

(43) 97thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securitysummarised the main events of the previous week. On the night ofthe llth/12th August, when there had been a sharp attack in thePlymouth area, 20 persons had been killed and 79 had been seriously injured, while other incidents had taken place in. the Bournemoutharea.On the previous night about 15 to 20 aircraft had operatedagainst Portsmouth, where 23 persons had been killed and 70injured. There had also been incidents at Brighton and at other places on the Sussex coast.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.Expeditionary 5.   The  War  Cabinet had before  them  a MemorandumForce Messages. (W.P. (43) 356) by the Postmaster-General, as Deputy Chairmanof the Imperial Communications Committee, reporting\he measures now in hand to reduce the delays experienced in the transmissionand delivery of Expeditionary Force messages. Given sufficientpersonnel to operate the service, it was hoped that messages would reach their destination in an average period of 4 days, exceptduring the Christmas period. The Committee, however, could notensure that the great volume of messages in the Christmas period- was handled with reasonable speed..The War Cabinet was accordingly asked  ^- (a) to approve the principle of the suspension of the service during that period; and(6) to direct that the personnel required to operate a four-dayservice during the remainder of the year should beprovided. ..   . .      As&apos; regards, (a), the Postmaster-General emphasised that theairgraph servicer-now greatly improved-would provide a service as speedy as the E.F.M., at considerably less cost.On the other hand, the view was expressed that the completesuspension of the E.F.M. at Christmas was likely to be misunder-stood and to give rise to discontent among the troops. The Secretaryof State for War asked that, the matter should be further examined.He suggested that the E.F.M. service should continue to be availablefor their original purpose of personal messages at Christmas time;but that means should be found to prevent the service being hope-lessly overloaded by the sending of a very large number of greetingstelegrams.As regards (6), it was explained that the point at issue wa.s theprovision of adequate numbers of A.T.S. and W.A.A.F. to take overthe work of coding and decoding addresses from &quot;the CensorshipDepartment.   ; , .
(i) Asked that the question of suspending the E.F.M. service during, the Christmas period should be further examined and a report made to them in a week&apos;s time.(ii) Agreed in principle that the necessary personnel should bemade available to operate the service during theremainder of the year to a four-day standard.Blackout. .Relaxation inIndustrialEstablishments.(previous reference:w.m. (43) 96thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The War Cabinet had before them the Report (W.P. (43)363) of the Committee appointed to consider what modificationscould be made, in the light of present circumstances, in the lighting restrictions affecting industrial establishments.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthe Committee&apos;s general conclusion, in which all the Departmentsrepresented had concurred, was that it would not be practicable in existing ^circumstances to introduce any general relaxations, suchas, the shortening of the hours, of the blackout, the removal of allblackout in industrial establishments, or the widespread substitu-tiOn of removable for permanent blackout. At the same, time, they considered that a number, of steps could be taken which would,cumulatively, assist towards an increase in production.   They&apos; recommended that the schemes put forward by the Supply Depart-ments for the substitution of removable for permanent blackout incertain factories should be approved and the work put in hand assoon as possible; that Other similar applications should be dealtwith as quickly as the supply of labour and materials permitted;and that various detailed proposals (summarised in paragraph 4&apos;of, the Report) for raising the standard Of exempted lighting should be pursued with the minimum of delay.    . -It was pointed out in the Report that the cost of substitutingremovable for permanent blackout would fall on the firms concerned;and it was suggested that, if this proved a serious obstacle, assistance might be provided under the Ministry of Supply Act. TheChancellor of the Exchequer undertook to consider this suggestion.The Minister of Production, commenting on paragraph 2 of theReport, said that under the earlier arrangements schemes forsubstituting removable for permanent blackout in industrial estab-lishments were considered by his Regional organisation only if thecost of the scheme exceeded  500. In view of the difficulty inobtaining materials, no such schemes had hitherto been handled byhis Department; but since the commencement of the Committee&apos;sinvestigations,, 59 such schemes had been brought forward by theSupply Departments and these would presumably now be submitted for consideration by the Regional organisation.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the recommendations made in this Report.Man-Power. 7.   The Minister of Production recalled  that the War(Previous        Cabinet&apos;s Conclusions of the 22nd July required the Minister ofReference:       Labour and National Service to ensure a net increase of 115,000 in w:m. (43) 102nd the labour force working for the Ministry of Aircraft ProductionConclusions,      during the period  1st April to 31st December,  1943;  and minute l.)       paragraph (14) of the conclusions specifically provided that.theadministrative arrangements, made by the Minister of Labour and national Service to give effect to the War Cabinet&apos;s allocations ofman-power should be such as to ensure that, if the supply up to theend of 1943 proved insufficient to meet all the approved require-ments, the deficit should not fall on the Ministry of Aircraft** -     Production. -In pursuance of these decisions, the Ministry of Labour and national Service had instructed their Regional Controllers that
in dealing with labour demands from the Supply Departments theyshould give an overriding preference to the Ministry of Aircraft&apos;Production. The Minister of Production said that he felt bound&quot;to raise two points in regard to these instructions : First, Ministryof Aircraft Production, work was so defined as to exclude certain industries and,processes which, though under the control of otherSupply Departments, were vital to the. production of aircraft;Secondly, the instructions contemplated that, unless all Ministryof Aircraft Production preference vacancies for a given month hadbeen filled, no labour would be supplied for the preference vacanciesof other Supply Departments..: The Minister said that this rigid interpretation of the WarCabinefs decisions would make it impossible for him to secure a proper balance between the various supply programmes, and its practical application was already producing results which wouldhave a serious effect on the production programmes of the admiralty and the Ministry of Supply.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply gaveexamples of the way in which these instructions would affect thework of his Department. For instance, they would have the resultthat wastage I in factories on Ministry of Supply work was only made good in areas where the Ministry of Aircraft Production had nounsatisfied labour demands; and plans for transfer of capacitywithin the Ministry of Supply programme would be jeopardised bythe possibility that the labour concerned would be transferred to ministry of Aircraft Production work. The Ministry of supply had been able to plan the previous reductions in their labour forcein such a way as to cause the least disturbance to the programmes;,and his Minister had been prepared to try to achieve the further reductions now demanded of him on a similarly planned basis. Butdislocation of programmes would be inevitable if the reductions were determined wholly by the geographical distribution of the Ministryof Aircraft Production^ labour needs.The Minister of Labour and National Service said thatthroughout the discussions he had made it clear that the Directiveproposed by the Prime Minister in W.P. (43) 319 and approved bythe War Cabinet at their Meeting on the 22nd July, would involve an overriding preference for the labour demands of the Ministry of aircraft Production. If in the instructions to his Regional Con-trollers the Ministry of Aircraft Production work had been definedtoo narrowly, there would be no difficulty in meeting that point by extending the definition. But this would not affect the questionof principle which the Minister of Production had raised. If hewas to ensure that no part of any deficit fell on the Ministry of aircraft Production, he must give an overriding preference to theMinistry of Aircraft Production demands up to the limits of theWar CabinetV allocation, and he did not see how he could modifythat part of his instructions unless he was relieved of his presentobligation to ensure that no part of any deficit fell on the Ministryof Aircraft Production. ;After further discussion the War Cabinet -Ittvited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Ministers of Production, Labour and NationalService, and Aircraft Production, to consider and report&apos; to the War Cabinet on the- points raised in discussion.In particular, they should consider whether (withoutreopening the man-power allocations made by the WarCabmet oh the 22nd July) the instructions issued by theMinister of Labour and National Service to his RegionalControllers required amendment; and; if so, whether suchamendment involved a^ (14).of the War Cabinefs Conclusions of the 22nd July.
Military 8.  The Secretary of State for War said that several Members^yernmeiit of of Parliament had asked whether they could be appointed toOccupied positions on the staff of &quot; AMGOT.&quot;   If their applications wereTerrltey. considered on their merits by the Selection Board, it was likely thatAppointment of the selection would not reflect the balance of political Parties in theMembers of      House of Commons.Parliament to It was pointed out in discussion that a number of Members of-f&apos; AMGOT&quot; staff. Parliament might possess very suitable qualifications for thesey    &quot; posts.  The general view of the War Cabinet was, however, that itmight be politically embarrassing if Members of Parliament were appointed to these posts. Furthermore, it was suggested that,although members of the &apos;&apos; AMGOT&apos;&apos; staff were technically membersof the Armed Forces, the appointments did not differ in substancefrom those to which the House of Commons Disqualification(Temporary Provisions) Act, 1941, applied; and that it would be inconsistent with the intention of that Act that a Member ofParliament who was not already in the Armed Forces should becommissioned for the specific purpose of working on the &quot;AMGOT &quot;staff.The War Cabinet-Recorded no. conclusion on the point, but invited theSecretary of State for War to consider the matter further in the light of the discussion, and in particular the- suggestion that appointments of Members of Parliamentto &quot; AMGOT&quot; should be limited to the transfer of those&apos; already actively employed in the Armed Forces.Air Operations. 9. The Minister of Aircraft Production said that at the lastCoastal Meeting of the Anti-U-Boat Warfare Committee he had been askedCommand. to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to the very fine way inwhich Coastal Command had carried out attacks on U-boats duringthe past month, and to the very satisfactory results which had been achieved.The War Cabinet-Asked the Secretary of State for Air to send a message on their behalf to the Commander-in-Chief, coastal command, conveying the congratulations of the WarCabinet on the achievements of the Command in the past.* month.Of/ices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,16th August, 1943.
