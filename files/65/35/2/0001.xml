In the other case, the ostensible, purposeofthe visit was political work in Eire on behalf of the Labour party and the Seamen&apos;s Union.The Home Secretary and the Minister of Home Security saw noreason to object to&apos; either of these Members going, to NorthernIreland. But visits to Eire, which was a neutral country, had to be judged by different standards; and it did not seem to him that in either of these cases there was any definite national advantage to be served by granting permission. At the same time, it was unlikelythat any positive harm would result from allowing these members to go to Eire; and it might be inexpedient to refuse the permissionif it were thought likely that such a course would lead to serious difficulties in Parliament.In discussion it was suggested that a clear distinction should bedrawn between journeys to Northern Ireland and journeys to Eire,and that applications for leave to travel to Eire should be dealt withon the same basis as applications in respect of any other neutral country. In present circumstances it should be the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to withhold facilities for travel to anyneutral country unless the Government were satisfied that a definitepublic advantage would be served by the journey, or that theapplicant had bpna fide domestic business to transact in thatcountry which was urgent and important and could not be trans-acted without a personal visit. It was agreed that these rules should apply to Members of Parliament in the same way as they appliedto other persons.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, as regards the two current applications from members of Parliament, the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security should grant permission fortravel&apos;to Northern Ireland, but should withhold per-mission to visit Eire.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to arrange that applications for facilities for travel to Eire andother neutral countries, whether by Members of Parlia-ment or by other persons, should in future be dealtwith on the lines indicated at &quot; X &quot; above.Palestine.Future policy.(previous reference:W.M.

W.M. 92 (43).rue yv ar uaomet naci a; ruii discussion on tne issues involved,a record of which is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File ofWar Cabinet Conclusions.Thei Warv Cabinet&apos;s conclusions: on the points calling forimmediate action were as follows :--(1) The first need was, for action which would help to dampdown the existing agitation arid prevent any furtheraggravation of the position in Palestine.  For this pur-fose a Joint Declaration by ourselves and the Unitedtates would be most valuable,(2) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for the Colonies were asked to settle the terms of the draft Declaration. It was suggestedthat this might follow the form of the draft suggestedby the United States Government^ (amended so as to bea Declaration by the two Governments and not by theUnited Nations), a sentence on the following lines beingsubstituted for the concluding sentence of that draft: &quot;In any case, as His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave already stated, no decision affecting the basicsituation in Palestine should be reached without full consultation With all concerned, including bothArabs and Jews; but they wish to make it clear thatthey have no intention of permitting or acquiescing in forcible changes of any kind in the status ofPalestine or the administration of the country.The United States Government are in full accord with this assurance.&quot;(3) The draft Declaration, as amended, should be sent to theHigh Commissioner for Palestine for his observationsbefore a reply was sent to the United States Ambassador.(4) It was decided in principle that the period during whichJewish immigration should be permitted, up to the white paper figure of 75,000, should be extended beyond the31st March, 1944.The Secretary of State for the Colonies undertook to consult the High Commissioner as to the best way ofgiving effect to this decision.   .(This conclusion is not to be taken as prejudicinglater decisions by the War Cabinet on immigration policy when the White Paper figure has been attained.)(5) No change should be made, without prior reference to theWar Cabinet, in the present approved policy for dealing. . with illegal stores of arms, Jewish or Arab; and nomeasures should be taken to disarm the Jews.unless or until equal measures could be effectively enforced againstthe Arabs.(6) A Cabinet Committee should be appointed to consider thelong-term policy for Palestine, r-The Prime Minister undertook to nominate theMinisters who should be asked to serve on thisCommittee.3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the immigration    Secretary of State for the Colonies (W;P. (43) 277).  -Policy. It was explained in the Memorandum that the scheme approved(Previous by the War Cabinet in December 1942, for the organised movementEeference; of 4,000 Jewish children with 500adults from Bulgaria to PalestineW.M.(42)i68th had been frustrated by German pressure on the Bulgarian Govern-Conciusions, ment, as a result of which the Bulgarian-Turkish frontier had nowMinute 9.) been closed to all Jews.Ah approach subsequently made to the* Sub-enclosure to Anne* I to W.P.

Botujiatiiari Government through&apos; the Swiss&apos;; Government showed,little sign of bearing fruit.It was the present policy of the War Cabinet that illegal immigration into; Palestine should be discouraged by all practicalmeans, and that no steps should be taken to facuitate the arrival of jewish refugees there. Illegal immigrants who succeeded in reactsihg Balestine were placed in detaihmeitt camps and graduallyreleased against the Current half-yearly immigration quotas.In present circumstances it seemed unlikely that there wouldbe any legal inmligratibri to/Palesti from enemy-occupied countries; and the Secretary of State for the Colonies therefore recommended that present policy as: regards illegal immigrationshould be modified on the lines indicated in paragraph 4 of his memorandum. If these proposals were accepted, any Jews who might in future escape to Turkey or to other neutral countries wouldbe regarded as eligible for onward transport to Palestine, wherethey would be placed in camps and, subject to security checks, wouldbe gradually released as legal immigrants against the currentimmigration quotas. Jews who escaped to countries in which their lives were not endangered would^ however, normally remain in thosecountries. There would be no public announcement of this change&quot;of policy, which would be subject to reconsideration in the event ofany material change in the situation in the Balkans.The War Cabinet-Approved this proposed change of policy, as set out inparagraph 4 of W.P. (43) 277.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,2nd July, 1943.
