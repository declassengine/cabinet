The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week; &apos; &apos;      a      .,Operations of Bomber Command had been restricted by weather1but two successful attacks had been made, one on Aachen and theother on Turin. The result of another attack on six transformerstations in Northern Italy was uncertain. The Peugeot MotorWorks at Montbeliard had also been attacked. Coastal command had made two promising and three possible attacks on U-boats and sunk, one 2,000-ton merchant ship. Enemy losses had been34 destroyed and 7 probably destroyed. Our losses had been46 bombers, 25 fighters and 8 Coastal Command aircraft.United States Air Forces had attacked airfields and depots inNorthern France.     ,United States Air Forces had sunk two and probably sunk oneU-boat off the west coast of Morocco.The Mediterranean Air Command had flown 14,700 sortiesduring the previous week compared with 2,200 sorties by the enemy.Sicily had been practically clear of Axis aircraft by the middle ofthe previous week. Our heavy bombers had attacked Messina,Naples, and airfields and ports in Southern Italy. That morningmarshalling yards in Rome had been bombed. Enemy losses in this area had been 309 destroyed, 44 probably destroyed and106 damaged. Our losses had been 89 operational aircraft andsome 30 transport aircraft.Shipping losses by enemy action during the previous week,including belated reports, amounted to 103,000 tons. This figureincluded 4 ships lost in the Sicilian operations.A satisfactory number of U-boats had been sunk during July.His Majesty&apos;s ships continued to give support to land operations.The War Cabinet were informed of the progress of operations in Sicily. The hardest fighting was taking place to the south ofCatania. The morale of the Italian forces was poor. Prisonersamounted to 29,000.The news from Russia was very reassuring. The russians were making two attacks, north and east of Orel, and had regainedall the ground that had been lost in the recent German offensivenorth of Kursk. The Russians had also launched two moreoffensives, one in the Rostov area and the other in the TamanPeninsula, about which they had so far given no information.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Prisoners ofWar.Shackling.(Previous .Reference:W,M. (43) 56thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Prime Minister said that he had been considering whether there was any further action we could take with a viewto compelling the German Government to discontinue the shacklingof British prisoners in their hands.Would it be possible to tell them that we were keeping an account of the number of man-hours during which British prisoners were kept in chains, and that it was our firm intention to shackleGerman officers after the war for a corresponding number ofman-hours? In the first instance we might perhaps inform the protecting Power in confidence that we contemplated making apublic announcement to this effect, unless within a specified timethe German Government gave satisfactory assurances that theshackling of British prisoners had been discontinued.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook toconsider this suggestion.[26785-2]
Ethiopia. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them-a Memorandnmvby^the(Previous        Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.; (W-B. (43) 317).  AttachedReference:       to the Memorandum were two telegrams from the Deputy MinisterW.M. (41) 120th of State in Cairo, dated the 4th and 14th July, ^and a telegramConclusions,      from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to our Minister atMinute 3.)       Addis Ababa, dated the 3rd July.  Lord Moyne, in histelegrams,urged that the present position in  Ethiopia was becoming increasingly unsatisfactory, and that we should take drastic actionto ensure a reasonably good administration in Ethiopia. He urgedf      that consideration should be given to the desirability of denouncingthe existing! Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement with a view to reaching a fresh Agreement providing for our long-term objectives, and withmaximum measures of control. *Reference was also made in discussion to two telegrams from our Minister at Addis Ababa, dated the 17th July and the 19th June(Nos. 584 and 476). In these telegrams the Minister, whilesuggesting that the present advisory, system might need to be modified, was opposed to any attempt to coerce the Emperor in thismatter unless we were prepared to give far more substantial aid.In his view action to obtain good government must be taken in collaboration with the Ethiopians. The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs expressed himself as in agreement with Mr. Howe&apos;views, especially as expressed in his telegram No. 584.The following were the main points in discussion : (a) The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that theposition on the frontier between Ethiopia and Kenyawas serious. Frequent raids took place across thefrontier, and the Emperor was powerless to stop them.To deal with the matter effectively, we should have to employ troops, who would probably have to cross thefrontier and occupy for a time the waterholes withinEthiopian territory.The Prime Minister said that We must give effective protection to our people in Kenya and, if necessary forthis purpose, must not shrink from punitive expeditionsacross the frontier.(&amp;) The main point in discussion was whether it was incumbentupon us to take action to ensure a reasonable standard ofadministration in Ethiopia.The Minister of State said that the position was deteriorating and that there was a danger that it wouldbecome chaotic. He favoured a visit by an experiencedofficer familiar with the discussions on policy in ethiopia which had taken place in London, and withthe past history of the country. He should spend sometime in Ethiopia and report on the position.&apos; At thepresent moment there was considerable conflict ofpersonalities. He believed that changes in the adviserswould be salutary.Alternatively, the Minister of State suggested thatHis Majesty&apos;s Minister at Addis Ababa, General Plattand the Governor of Kenya might be invited to attend aConference on Ethiopia in Cairo.     - . &apos;&apos;&apos;(c) Mr. Bruce reminded the War Cabinet that it had beenv.&apos;., generally recognised before the war that it had been a mistake to allow Ethiopia to join the League of Nations,and but for Italy&apos;s attack upon her Ethiopia wouldprobably have been called upon to justify her positionand answer for the misgoverament that was going on in her territories before the Bar Of the League of Nations.He added that in such an event Ethiopia would have hadto accept some drastic supervision or be expelled fromthe. League. We had driven the Italians out of Ethiopia,
163W.M. 101 (43).and until such time as there was a world authority wewere more or less in the position of trustees for the worldwith regard to Ethiopia: It would be very embarrassing to us if, after the war, it were shown that, under ourguidance, Ethiopia had reverted to an even worse statethan in 1935.(d) As against this, the War Cabinet were reminded thatwe had deliberately decided not to attempt any detailedsupervision or control of Ethiopian administration. Thetask of raising the standard of civilisation in Ethiopiamight, conceivably, be Undertaken as an internationalresponsibility after the war. But there was no obligation of trusteeship resting upon His Majesty&apos;sGovernment now to ensure good government in Ethiopia.And, in any event, it was doubtful whether in presentcircumstances we could spare the resources to achieve this even if we wished to do so.(e) It was pointed out that the financial settlement had been based upon (i) a tapering subsidy, and(ii) a lump sum, not related to any specific period, todeal with unforeseeable expenditure in the transition period.It was suggested that, if the country was beingbadly administered, we ought to withdraw this financial support.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe Secretary of State for the Colonies took the view  hatit would be against our interests to withdraw anysubstantial part of this subsidy. It was a part of our policy that the Emperor&apos;s Government should bemaintained and, if our financial support were suddenlywithdrawn, the Emperor&apos;s position would be precarious.At the same time, there was no reason why we should not make use of the financial arrangements to induce theEmperor to improve his administration.The War Cabinet&apos;s Conclusions were as follows(1) General agreement was expressed with the continuance ofour present policy in Ethiopia as outlined in recent telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Addis Ababaand by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in discussion in the War Cabinet.(2). The Secretary of State for the Colonies should ensure thatthe frontier between Kenya and Ethiopia was effectivelyguarded, and should submit a report to the War Cabinetindicating what measures and what military forces might be required for this purpose.(3) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should consider,in consultation with the Minister of State, whether thesituation was such as to demand the summoning of some local conference to consider the position in Ethiopia.In the meantime the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs was authorised to despatch the draft telegramprinted as Annex I to W.P. (43) 317.(4) It would be undesirable that we should withdraw financial support from Ethiopia at the present time; but thesupport afforded should, so far as possible, be administered in such a way as to encourage the adoptionof a correct attitude on the part of the Emperor.
Ait PoliOy;ijr;-(Previous :       iEeferenceisf;W.M. (43) 100th-Conclusions,Minute 1.);v v4.; The War Cabinet were informed that Lord Fitzalan was toask;a Question;in the House of--Lords on the following day aboutthe bombing of Rome. &apos;The Prime Minister said that he had already explained theGovernments policy in this matter to Lord Fitzalan, when he came to see him recently to represent the anxieties of the Roman Catholiccommunity about the possibility that. Rome might be bombed. Itshould be i made clear, / in replying toi the Question, that, while wecould not forgo our right to take military action against Rome,both as the centre of the Fascist Government and on account of themilitary objectives which the city contained, special instructions hadbeen given to those taking part in this operation that the greatest care was to be taken to avoid damage to religious and culturalmonuments. It might also be possible to give some particulars aboutthe results of the raid, in the light of detailed information whichmight become available before the Question was answered.The War Cabinet-.Invited the Lord Privy Seal to deal with the Question onthese lines.Mr. R. G. Casey.Sir RamaswamlMudaliar.5. The Prime Minister said that this was the last Meeting ofthe War Cabinet which Mr. Casey would be attending during his present visit to this country. He was sure that this visit had beenfruitful, and he and all his colleagues had greatly valuedMr. Casey&apos;s presence at their Meetings.Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar was also leaving that week to returnto India to take up his appointment as Minister for Supply in theGovernor-General&apos;s Executive Council. He took the good wishes of all of them in his important new duties.The War Cabinet-Warmly endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.War Pensions.Pensions appeal tribunals Bill.(previous reference erence:W.M. (43) 95thConclusions, *Minute 2.)6. At their Meeting on the 8th July, the War Cabinet had invited the Minister of Pensions to consider whether the PensionsAppeal Tribunals Bill should be amended so as to confer a rightof appeal against interim awards made before final assessment.The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum on this pointby the Minister of Pensions (W.P. (43) 314). It was recommended in the Memorandum that the Bill should confer aright to appeal against an interim award two years after it wasmade; but that, in view of the substantial amount of additional work which this would involve both for the Ministry of Pensionsand for the Tribunals, the Bill should also provide that this rightshould not become operative until a future date when the initialpressure of work on the more important appeals would have beenrelaxed.The War Cabinet were informed that the Lord President ofthe Council,and the Minister of Pensions had seen some of theMembers who had taken part in the debates on this Bill, and had ascertained that they were likely to be content with the amendment in this form. The Minister of Pensions had also ascertained thatthe amendment would be acceptable to the British Legion.At the War Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion the question had alsobeen raised whether there should be any right of appeal to a tribunal against discretionary decisions by the Minister ofPensions. The War Cabinet were informed that this point had alsobeen discussed with Members who had taken part in the debates.It now appeared that, in matters in which the Minister exercised a discretion, they did not desire that this discretion should be limited;
165w.m. ioi (my.and, that they recognised that there could not properly be ah appealto a Tribunal against a decision dependent oh the exercise of a ministerial discretion.The War Cabinefr-(1) Authorised the Minister of Pensions to bring forward an amendment of the Pensions Appeal Tribunals Bill on thelines indicated in the last paragraph of W.P. (43) 314.(2) Agreed that no action should be taken with a view to making it possible for a pensioner to appeal to a tribunal against a discretionary decision of the Ministerof Pensions.7. . In accordance with the decisions reached at their Meetingon the 14th July, the War Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (43) 312) containing a series of recommendations in regard to our policy in the middle east.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved these recommendations, subject to the followingamendment suggested by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, namely, the substitution for the second sentence of paragraph (1), of the following: &quot; This development, which should allow room for the association as desired of any other Govern-ments with special interests in the Middle East area,should be carried out cautiously.&quot;(2) Agreed that, before any approach was made to the UnitedStates Government in regard to paragraph (2) of therecommendations, advance notice should be given to theDominion Governments and the Government of India.Note. The full text of the recommendations, as amended,is printed as a footnote to W.M. (43) 99th Conclusions,Minute 2.8. The War Cabinet were informed that an Address had been passed by both Houses of Parliament in Canada praying that HisMajesty would cause legislation to be presented to the parliament at Westminster, providing that, notwithstanding the provisions ofthe British North America Acts, it should not be necessary that the representation of the Canadian Provinces in the Canadian House ofCommons be readjusted, in consequence of the decennial census of1941, until after the war. It was desired that this legislation shouldbe passed by the Parliament at Westminster before the canadian parliament rose on the 24th July.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that thenecessary legislation was being prepared, and he was bringing thematter before the Legislation Committee on the following day. he proposed that the Bill should be introduced forthwith in the Houseof Lords and that every effort should be made to pass it into law before the 24th July.The War Cabinet^-Took note of this statement.Middle East.British Policy.(previous reference:W.M.

&quot;Battle ofBritainSunday.&quot;9. The Secretary of State f&amp;r the* Home Department and minister of Heine. Security said-that in previous years a civil defence Day had been organised in the autumn, A.suggestion had now been made that a &quot; Battle of Britain Sunday &quot; should be heldin September, to celebrate the Battle of Britain in 1940; andshould be organised jointly by the Ministry of Home Security, theAir Ministry, the Ministry of Aircraft Production and the WarOffice (in respect of;Anti-Aircraft Units). It was proposed that the function should comprise a Service in St. Paul&apos;s and a parade inLondon.The War Cabinet-Approved in principle this suggestion and asked that theMinisters concerned should proceed with the necessary arrangements in consultation.        .Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,19th July, 1943.
BO flTRfllTTtATTflW.- MOST SECRET -w*m,t(4?),. iplgt gqnctoiqns .(Monday, 19th July, 1943.)The following matters were mentioned in Cabinet,but it was decided not to record them.THE SECRETARY&quot; OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatthe leader of the Polish Secret Army in Poland had been arrested.   The Poles were much disturbed about the positionand feared that he would be put to death.   It was suggestedthat some threat might be made which would deter theGermans from this action.ThaJoreign Secretary said that he did not think therewas scnyJiSztoS which we could take in the matter.     the leader 4)f the Polish Secret Army was, in law, not a prisoner of war, but a franc-tireurr.Agreement was expressed with this view.CRETE. Mention was made of the atrocities carried out by theGermans in Crete following the successful Commando raid.Hews of these atrocities had not yet been published.PRISONERS. In connection with the discussion on the shackling of  -prisoners of war,   THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that theGermans, by keeping a very large number of Frenchmen ofmilitary age as prisoners for several years, had undoubtedlytaken action which would affect the French population.He thought that it was for consideration whether somecorresponding action should not be taken against theGermans at the end of the war:    that is to say, that alarge number of young German males should be segregatedfrom their womenfolk and used on forced labour for aperiod of years to repair the damage done by Germany.The view expressed in discussion was that while therewas much to be said for this idea from the point of viewof abstract justice, it was very difficult to believe thatsuch a measure could be enforced for any appreciable time,and that it would be better to leave any retributive actionto be taken by the Russians.POLAND oOffices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
