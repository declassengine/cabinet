Parliament.Debate on theWar Situation.Widows&apos; and old-age pensions.Supplementary-Pensions.. (previous reference&quot;:W.M. (43) 71stConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The War Cabinet were informed that the Labour Party. had asked that facilities should be afforded for a Debate on the war situation before the Recess. They wished to have an opportunityof discussing the arrangements for the civil administration of&apos;occupied enemy territories; and they were concerned to know, inparticular, whether&quot; those arrangements were such as would enableeffective contact to be made with the labour movements in. those territories. ,It was pointed out that the Government could not prevent thesematters being raised in the Debates on the Consolidated Fund andthe Adjournment during the following week. Some Ministers took the view that in these circumstances it would be preferable toarrange a short ordered Debate, as this might give less opportunityto the handful of Members who would wish to seize this opportunityfor criticism.The Prime Minister thought that, in the absence of a well-supported demand for a Debate on a definite Motion, to be followedby a Division, it would be inappropriate at the present time thatthe Government should give facilities for the discussion, of thesematters. He suggested that the reply to this request should be thatthe Government had not changed their view that it would be contrary to both national and international interests that the Houseof Commons should debate the war situation at the present time.Should there be some marked change in the situation before theHouse rose, the Government would, of course, reconsider their .attitude.-The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to dealwith the matter on these lines in reply to the Questionwhich was to be put by Mr. Arthur Greenwood on thefollowing day.&apos;2. The War Cabinet were informed that it was necessary topresent to Parliament, before the Recess, the Regulations which hadbeen made for the purposes of the Pensions and Determination ofNeeds Act, 1943. A White Paper was to be presented with these regulations, and there was to be a Debate in the House of commons during the following week. During that Debate there was likelyto be criticism of the rates of supplementary pensions.The Assistance Board were at present considering the codifi-cation and simplification of all the Regulations relating to supplementary pensions. When this simplified code was presented to Ministers there would be an opportunity, for the Government to review these wider questions; and it had been agreed, at a meetingof the Lord Presidents Committee on the previous day, that thesequestions should be considered by Ministers at that stage.The suggestion had since been made and agreed to that the government&apos;s position in the Debate&quot; during the following week would be eased if the White Paper included a reference to thisforthcoming codification of the Regulations. Some Ministers alsowished to include in the White Paper a statement that, when this new code was presented to Parliament, the position &quot; could then be reviewed.&quot; Other Ministers felt that any reference to a &quot; review,&quot;if included in the White Paper or volunteered by the Governmentin the Debate, would be construed as a pledge that some improve-ments in the rates would be conceded.The War CabineVs Conclusions were as follows: -(1) When the Assistance Board had prepared the simplified. code of Regulations relating to supplementary pensions,the Government would consider on their merits the outstanding suggestions for revision of the rates ofsupplementary pensions. This matter would be con-sidered in the first instance; by the LordT President&apos;sCommittee.
193W.M. 107(43).(2) In the White Paper to be presented to Parliament in respectof the present ^Regulations made for the purposes of thePensions and Determination of Needs Act, 1943, the reference to the proposed codification of the Regulationsrelating to supplementary pensions should be followedby the statement that this code &quot; will come before theHouse on a Motion which is, of course, debatable.&quot;SelectCommittee onNationalExpenditure.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 56thConclusions,Minute 11.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the lord president of &quot;the Council and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(W.P. (43) 336) reporting the result of their negotiations with theSelect Committee on National Expenditure.Whilst they had not on every point received from the Committeethe precise assurance for which they asked, they thought that theGovernment could be reasonably satisfied with what had been achieved and could look forward to a period of better relations withthe Committee. They accordingly recommended that no further action, other than a careful watch on the Committee&apos;s activities,should be taken for the time being.The Minister of Production thought that it was unfortunate that the Select Committee had not been prepared to meet the viewsof Ministers by undertaking that the Departmental Liaison officers should always accompany the Committee on the occasion of visits to outside establishments. He thought that, if this practice wasnot followed, there was a risk that difficulties would continue to-arise. Nevertheless, he felt sure that the right course was to acceptthe assurances which had been offered, and to give the matter a trialon that basis.This view was endorsed generally.The War Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the results of the negotiations with the Lord President of the Council and theChancellor of the Exchequer had had with the SelectCommittee; and invited Departments to report to theTreasury any cases in which they considered that the assurances given had not been adhered to.Trade disputes and TradeUnions Act,1927.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 105thConclusions,Minute 2.)4.:&apos; The War Cabinet resumed discussion of this matter.After a discussion, details of which are recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions, the WarCabinet - &quot;(1) Invited the Prime Minister to make arrangements to see inthe near future the Deputation which he had undertaken, to receive from three Civil Service Unions (the PostOffice Engineering Union, the Inland Revenue StaffFederation, and the Civil Service Clerical Association).The Prime Minister asked that the Postmaster-general should accompany him on this occasion.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council to prepare, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, thedraft of a statement which the Prime Minister might make to the Deputation on this occasion.(3) Agreed that this statement (or a summary of it) would bemade public after the Deputation has been received. It.would follow the lines generally indicated in discussion,and in particular would set out the consequences whichwould ensue if the application for affiliation to theT.U.C. now pending was proceeded with.
-vvv-f&apos;vv^^ :&apos;.    ;i; 194   /: ;   -structure of a 5:   The Prime Minister said that, following the circulation ofPoat-War. his Note (W.P, (43) :233) on the structure of a post-war settlement,Settlement. a number of Memoranda on this subject had been circulated to theWar Cabinet by the Secretaries of State for Foreign and DominionAffairs (W.F. (43) 244, 292, 300 and 321). He suggested that itwould be convenient if the questions raised in these Memorandawere considered in the first instance by a small Cabinet Committee.The War Cabinet-Appointed a Committee composed of-The Deputy Prime Minister (Chairman),The Secretatry of State for Foreign Affairs,The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for Air,The Minister of Aircraft Production,The Postmaster-General, *. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury,The Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry ofLabour (Mr. Tomlinson, M.P.),The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Food,to consider, and report to the War Cabinet upon the issues raised in the Memoranda mentioned above on the&apos;structure of a post-war settlement.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,29th July, 1943.
(THIS^ IXJCP^m IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRTEApiC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEBM5EHT)MOST SECRET. HO CIRCULATION.W.M.(43) 107TH CONCLUSIONS.^ (29th July 194^. at 5.10 p.m.)COME TAXo THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, while &quot;Hiescheme for the deduction of income tax from earnings had onction on basisif current the whole been successful, there had been continuing pressureearnings.to put this scheme on a &quot;pay-as-you-go11 basis.    He had been anxious to meet this demand, specially since the present systemof deductions measured by the earnings of a previous period would inevitably give rise to difficulties ishen earnings began to decline.    He cas glad to be able to inform the War Cabinetthat he had now been able to devise, sith the assistance ofthe Lord President, the Minister of Labour and National Serviceand the Minister of Supply, a practicable scheme for collectingincome tax on a &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; basis from workers in receiptof weekly wages.    Under  this scheme the weekly deduction of income tax would keep step with any variation in earnings;and the whole of the tax liability in respect of any yieraar wouldbe measured by, and deducted from, the pay of that year, so thatno substantial arrears of tax would be hanging over the wage-earner at the end of the year.The Trades Union Congress and the Employers&apos; Confederationwould be consulted before the scheme was presented to Parliament.The introduction of this scheme would necessitate the :remission of that part of the tax for the year 1943/44 which inthe normal course would be due for deduction from earnings after5th April 1944*.    The transition from one basis of collection tothe  other ^ould involve an overlap, of ten months1 tax for

manual workers and seven months for other sage-earners.) andremission would have to be made to the extent of this overlap.This sas inevitable as it would be impracticable to collecttax on the old basis at the same time as tax was being collectedon the new basis, for this would involve levying two years&apos;taxes on one year1 s income.    The Exchequer would suffer no immediate loss from this remission, for it would receive tax on the new basis in place of tax on the old.    The worker would,however, benefit;   for (a) when his earnings fell his tax would fall at once;   (b) when rates of tax fell his tax would fall atonce;   and (c) when he died or left his employment there wouldbe no arrears of taxation to be paid.    The total amount involvedin this remission would be about  2fjOM*;   but part at any rateof this taxation could never have been collected.It was proposed that this scheme should be broughtinto force on 6th April, 1944;   and that the necessary legislation should be introduced in the autumn of this year.THE WAR CABINET s-Took note of this statement.War Cabinet Office, S.W.129th July, 1943.
