3WM. 121 (43).Mutual Aid 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the ChancellorAgrtement. of the Exchequer (W.P. (43) 383), This Note stated that the UnitedMonetary States Administration had now agreed that we should send a clearing Delegation early in September to discuss Article 7 as a whole,Union. including the scheme for a Monetary Clearing Union,  and(Previous summarised the three points on which we might fail to reachReference:     agreement with the Americans.W.M. (43) 106th Attached to the Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was conclusions; a Memorandum by the Treasury setting out briefly the history of minute 3.)      the negotiations on this matter; summarising the essential Americanconditions and our own minimum requirements; and concluding by setting out the instructions Within which it was proposed that our representatives should work.The War Cabinet also had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (43) 384) expressing/ :&quot;. agreement with the proposal that the Delegation should leave duringthe first week in September for discussions with the United StatesGovernment on Monetary Policy, Commodity Policy, commercial policy, and possibly International Investment.Discussion centred round the six following points(a) General.There was general agreement that it was most desirable that&apos; this attempt should be made to reach agreement with the Americanson a statement of principles tor a Monetary Clearing Union before any further discussions took place with the representatives of othercountries. It had been arranged, however, that the discussions should take place between officials and that neither Governmentwould be committed to any views the officials might arrive at.The point was raised by the Paymaster-General whether,although our scheme was better than the American scheme, it waswise to risk a breakdown by giving our representatives too rigidinstructions. He thought that they should not be precluded fromattempting to bridge the points of difference between ourselves andthe Americans (none of which he regarded as insuperable) bydetailed exploration of the position and by further definition.The Deputy Prime Minister and Lord Halifax took the view(which was generally shared by the War Cabinet) that in a matterof this kind there was nothing to be lost by making a firm and clear statement of our position. The Americans would not resent this.Furthermore, it was desirable that, although the. discussions werebetween officials and were non-committal, the War Cabinet should keep the conduct of the discussions under their general control at allv       stages.    : - - 1: The Chancellor of the Exchequer attached importance to our instructions being definitely worded on points in regard to which parliament and the public were likely to hold strong views. he added that our representatives would be instructed that, if it looked as though the discussions were likely to break doWn, they should report home before matters reached a critical stage.(b) Should we insist that the Fund must not buy or sell gold orcurrencies, and that its transactions should be limited to trans-ferring holdings of Unit as from the name of one Central Bank a,tits request into the name of another?The President of the Board of Trade and the Minister ofLabour and National Service attached importance to Our adopting a firm line on this matter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in agreement&apos;with the views expressed, and that the instructions, to the delegatesalready provided for this point.(c) To what extent should the initial subscriptions take the form. of gold? -&apos;. - [26029]    &apos; - . b 2
The President of the Board of Trade said that he hoped that&apos;.,our representatives would do their hest to-ensure that the schemewas based on gold to. the minimum possible extent.  He would likethem to, star thy reaffirming the conception in the scheme which we- - had originally put forward, namely, that there should be no sub-scription in gold to the Fund. - If, however, we were unable to adhere to this position, we should be prepared to concede goldsubscriptions to the extent proposed in the first published American. , draft,.namely, 12  per cent., but no more.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of American opinion, he thought it would be a mistake in tactics to start by adopting the position that there should be no gold subscription. Hethought that it would be better that Lord Keynes should make itclear that his personal opinion remained as before, namely, that agold basis should be eliminated from the Clearing Union scheme;, but that he should also indicate that, in order to reach agreement,we were prepared to agree to a gold subscription of 12  per cent.In reply to further questions, the Chancellor of the Exchequer; said that our representatives should be instructed that, besides beingour initial position, this should be as far as they could go subject,of course, to further reference to London.(d) Exchange-Rates.&apos;r&apos; Paragraph 7 (d) of the Memorandum by the Treasury read asfollows :-&apos;&apos; Member countries must not be deprived of reasonablefacility to alter their exchange-rates hereafter if they believethat the circumstances require this.&quot; :The President of the Board of Trade agreed that we ought notto be tied too rigidly in this matter. At the same time, he thoughtit would be a pity if the matter was left in such a way that othercountries were in a position to adjust their exchange-rates at their discretion without reference to some objective standard.   He-    attached great importance to steps being taken to develop an objective test which could be applied in this sphere. He referred inthis connection to the provisions in paragraphs 6 (8) (a) and 37and 38 of our original proposals in the White Paper (Cmd. 6437),and also to the corresponding provision in regard to the main-W.M. (43) 50th tenance of quantitative import restrictions which had been insertedConclusions,    in the Aide-Memoire on the Commercial Policy scheme (see W.P.Minute l.       (43) 334, Annex A, paragraph (vii)).The President of the Board of Trade added that our represen-tatives should be instructed to oppose any.solution of this questionwhich would result in the right of a country to adjust its exchange-rates being the subject of a debate and a vote in the Governing Body.Several Ministers supported the view that it was desirable toarrange for some objective test to be worked out in this field. It wasalso pointed out that, while the scheme must provide a reasonabledegree of flexibility, and must make due provision for sovereignrights in this matter, we also had a good deal to gain from the intro-dUction of a scheme which would prevent other countries from making adjustments in their exchanges, without reference to someobjective test, in a way which would damage our own interests.  -The Secretary of State for the Colonies thought that the riskof decisions being taken by a majority vote, from the point of viewof power politics, was one which applied to this point in particular,but also to the scheme as a whole. He was anxious, therefore, to see it made clear that, wherever discretion was left to those charged withthe management of the Clearing Union, this discretion should beexercised by reference to some objective test.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in agreementwith the objectives which the President of the Board of Trade had mentioned. At the same time, he thought that the wiser course was
to&apos;--avoid.vtbhy-much&apos;-precision- in :-the! instructions at this stage. Wemust establish a. measure of elasticity as to the rights of each government in this matter, and if some appeal was to be made&apos; toobjective tests, we must avoid the&apos; risk of a Wrangle about theapplication of these tests, which would delay action. He would,however, see what could be done on the lines put forward in discussion.(e) Composition of a Drafting Committee.It was stated in paragraph 2 of the Note by the Chancellor ofthe&apos;Exchequer that, if there was a substantial measure of agreementbetween the Americans and ourselves, a small Drafting Committeewould be collected in Washington representing, besides these twocountries, Russia, China, Canada, Mexico, and, it was hoped, at-least-one&apos; European country, either Holland, Belgium or Greece.The Deputy Prime Minister thought it would be desirable that either an Australian or a New Zealand representative should beadded, if possible.The Secretary of State for India thought that, in that event,India should also be represented. In any Case, she should be repre-sented on any subsequent larger committee that might be set up.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would see what could be done to meet these views. He thought, however, that themost helpful course might well be to ensure that the Committeeincluded representatives of two European&quot; countries. He would take steps to see that reference was made to London before the composi-tion of a Drafting Committee was finally settled.(f) Composition of the British Delegation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it had been proposed that the Delegation should be composed, so far as officials were concerned, on the basis set out in paragraph 2 of his memorandum. It had also been suggested that it should be headed by the Parliamentary TJnder-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.He and the Prime Minister had agreed to this course.This arrangement was approved.The War Cabinet-Approved the Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer as constituting directions to our delegates at the forthcoming discussions on a Monetary Clearing Union, subject to such modifications or additions as might be necessary to cover the following points : (1) Not more than 12^ per cent, of the initial subscriptionshould be paid in gold.(2) While countries should retain a reasonable measure ofelasticity over their own exchange rates, an endeavour should be made to ensure that decisions to modify exchange rates were taken by reference tosome objective test.(3) If and when a Drafting Committee was collected in washington, we should endeavour to secure that theCommittee comprised a representative of other important Empire Countries, and a representativeof at least&apos; one European country. Instructions onthis matter should be sought from London at theappropriate moment.(4) Our representatives, while having clear instructions asto the lines on which they should work, should be told that, if it seemed likely that rigid adherence to these instructions would result in a breakdown of the discussions, they should report to Londonbefore a critical stage was reached.
