respect ofpart-timeindustrialwork.-;r,U;g&apos;V$       180. ,   - fWiMMm     : .\Trade Unions. 1. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the HomeMembership by Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (43) 318) proposingPolicemen in that the Police Act, 1919, should be amended by a defence regulation so as to allow a policeman who is, with the. consent ofhis Chief Officer of Police, engaged in war work while off duty tojoin the Trade Union which is ordinarily concerned with theconditions of employment in the trade or occupation in which heis so engaged and is not composed wholly or mainly of policemen.the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security explainedthat some 300 Metropolitan policemen had been allowed to take part-time employment of national importance during their sparetime. Some of them, who were working for a firm of packing-casemakers, had been invited to join the appropriate Trade Union; andhad replied that, as policemen, they were not at liberty to do so.The point had been taken up, as one of principle, by the general council of the Trades Union Congress. The Home Secretary and minister of Home Security felt that, on the merits, there Was novalid reason why these men should be precluded from joining theUnion, if they wished to do so, in respect of this part-time work;and, as the Trades Union Congress seemed to attach importance to- the point, he would have thought it right to meet them by amending the law on the lines proposed in his Memorandum.In discussion, objection was taken to this proposal on twogrounds :-First, it was represented that, if such a Defence Regulationwere made at the present time, it might be made the occasion forpremature discussion in the House of Commons of the general issueregarding the position of Civil Servants under the Trade disputes act, 1927. The efforts which had been made (so far with considerable success) to avoid for the time being any. public discussion of this wider issue would be stultified if this opportunitywere given to those who were anxious to stir up controversy on thisquestion.Secondly, the view was expressed that it would be inexpedient to amend Trade Union law by Defence Regulation. The proposedDefence Regulation would have to include a provision to the effectthat, when a policeman discontinued his part-time industrial work,his membership of the Trade Union should come to an endnotwithstanding anything in the rules of the Union. Might it not then be necessary for the Regulation also to provide for the mannerin which the policeman&apos;s contributions and other rights should bedealt with on his ceasing to be a member of the Union 1 There was much to be said for the view that, in the case of a self-governinginstitution like a Trade Union, the State should not intervene inmatters of this kind, which should be left to be determined by theinstitution itself.The view of the War Cabinet was that it would be inexpedient,for the purpose of regularising the position of these 300 men, to invite Parliamentary controversy on the general issues connectedwith section 5 of the Trade Disputes Act, 1927. The reply to the representations made by the Trades Union Congress should be that,in the considered view of the Government, it was inexpedient thatthe question of allowing these policemen to join a Trade union should be raised at the present stage; and that, if the matter were pressed, the Government would feel obliged in the last resort towithdraw the permission given to these men to engage in part-timeindustrial work when off duty.The War Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security to deal with the matter on these lines.
