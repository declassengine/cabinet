J     announcement of the Armistice, in his message to the Italian.armed forces and people, would be issued at the same time.  .        !--.-,.&apos;The purpose of the War Cabinet Meeting was to decide uponvarious arrangements consequential upon this announcement.  TheConclusions reached were as follows : (1) Communication to the Dominions.The Dominion Governments had been informed on the4th September that the short Armistice Terms had been signed on the preceding day.(a) The Lord Privy Seal (acting on behalf of the dominions secretary) would telegraph at once to the dominion prime Ministers, informing them that the signature of the Armistice would be announced on thefollowing afternoon; and that it was essential, for operational reasons, that the terms should still bekept secret.(6) The Lord Privy Seal would telegraph to the PrimeMinister asking him to send a personal telegram toMr. Mackenzie King, to inform him that theannouncement of the signature of the Armisticewould take place on the following afternoon.(c) The Lord Privy Seal would inform the Dominion high commissioners of the announcement at their meetingat 3*30 p.m. on the following afternoon.(2) Communication to Allied Governments.(a) The Foreign Office would despatch an immediatej telegram to our Ambassador at Moscow, instructing him to impress on Premier Stalin that, when the* signature of the Armistice was announced, it was essential, for operational reasons, that the terms should still be kept secret. %(6) The Foreign Secretary undertook to tell M. Maisky at-30 p,m. on the following afternoon the text of theannouncement to be made by General Eisenhower.(c) The Foreign Secretary would make a similar communi-catioh to representatives of the Allied Governments&apos;    at 4-30 p.m. on the following afternoon.(d) It had been arranged that the United States Govern-ment would make any necessary communication tothe representatives of China and of Latin America.(3) The Foreign Secretary undertook to inform Ministers ofCabinet rank who were in London of the position at ameeting to be arranged on the following morning.(4) Publicity and Press.(a) The Ministry of Information would Wait until theannouncements from Algiers and Rome had beenmonitored, and would hand them out to the Press,as being the text of announcements made by General.* * Eisenhower and Marshal Badoglio.. (b) The Foreign Office undertook to communicate withWashington and ascertain that they were proposing to follow the same, course,:and not to make some independent announcement of the signature of theArmistice.(c) It was believed that there would be strong pressure for publication of the Armistice Terms. operational reasons prevented us from disclosing the terms, orfrom giving any explanation ofthe reasons for non-disclosure at this juncture.  The Director-General,
19UfcjflL 125 (43).Ministry of Information, was, however, authorisedto inform the principal Editors, in confidence, ofthe reasons why the Armistice Terms could not forthe present be disclosed.(d) The announcement of the signature of the Armisticewould inevitaby give rise to a crop of stories as to how the negotiations had taken place. Was it possible to make a short statement of some of the&quot;salient facts?The Director-General, Ministry of Informa-tion, was invited&apos;to prepare a draft setting out thechief points which he would like to include in sucha statement. This draft would be shown to theChief s of Staff and submitted, with their comments,to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The draft, when approved, should be tele-graphed to Algiers before release.(e) The Director-General, Ministry of Information, was authorised to deny flatly any statements that SignorGrandi had been in any way concerned in thenegotiations. &apos;. &apos;(5) Political Warfare.The Director-General of Political Warfare was authorisedto communicate the text of General Eisenhower&apos;s announcement to his staff, for translation, one hour before the time of release,for use on the European services. He could make use, in european broadcasts, of the fact that the Russians had approved the Armistice Terms; and he might use, with discretion, any evidence at the disposal of his organisation asto co-operation between Marshal Badoglio&apos;s Government and left elenients in Italy. It was, however, undesirable to refer in broadcasts to co-operation between the Italians and theAllies.(6) Parliament.On the 30th July an undertaking had been given that, ifthere should be some marked change in the situation, the leader of the House would not.hesitate to call the House together, evenif it was within a few days; of the end of the Adjournment.There might, therefore, be a demand for the House to be called together before the date arranged.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook toconsider the position in consultation with the Chief Whip.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,7th September, 1943.
