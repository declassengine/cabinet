(43) 319) .puttihg forward rievisedproposals for the final approval of the War Cabinet.The following were the main points dealt with in discussion;-(a) The Minister of Production,emphasised the importance which he attached to the proposal in paragraph 3 of W.P. (43) 319that he, in conjunction with the Ministers concerned, should endeavour to arrange block transfers of orders or capacity and machine tools between the. Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of aircraft Production.-i   (b) Reference was made to the proposal in paragraph 11 that&apos; &apos; no part of any deficit should be allowed to fall on the Ministry of^Aircraft Production; and that the Minister.: of Labour : mustdistribute any deficit pro rota amongthe other claimants.The Minister of Labour and National Service and the Service\ Ministers said that the literal application of this proposal would^involve serious practical difficulties;The Prime Minister said that the formula in this paragraphmust be taken as showing the aim in view and the. spirit. in whichthe arrangements should be applied,&apos; rather than as prescribing a fixed procedure. ; :(c). In this connection the Minister of Labour;and NationalService thought it would- be convenient if the Minister of Produc-tion would hold regular meetings with the First Lord Of theAdmiralty, the Minister of Supply, the Minister of - aircraft production and himself; at which practical ways,of transferringman-power, and productive effort to aircraft production could j be devised with a view to giving effect to the policy now proposed: -It was agreed that such meetings would be of assistance, andthat a report should be made to the War Cabinet when necessary.(d) The First Lord of the ^^Mr^ypsaid that he assmnedthat he wOuld have discretion, if necessary; to vary the allocationbetween  the intake  into the Royal Navy,  Admiralty  ship-/^-$uUding^&amp;e./; . iThis was agreed to.(e) The Minister of Labour and National Service sai4-that,although no specific provision had been made.fbr^allocations, he-would like it recorded that step^ to bistaken to build up the labour force engaged in ^The m^power position in the mining industryfalser gave, rise toanxiety.                                                       &apos;     &apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos;:&apos;&apos;^:;V;^v^v ;
(/) The Prime Minister referred, to the discussion which hadtaken/ plac$ at the . previous: Meeting regarding^ the suggestedEnquiry into Royal Air Force establishments. He had been in communication On this, matter with the Secretary of State for Air,who&apos;did riot wish to take part in the enquiry himself,^although, ofcourse,-he would do all in his power to facilitate it: The PrimeMinister said that the Enquiry would be carried out by the deputy prime Minister, the Minister of Production and the Payniaster-;; General,. the,Terms of Reference being- v -      .&quot; To enquire into the proportion which the groundpersonnelof the Royal Air Force bears to-v   &apos; (a) First-line strength, and:     -(6) Sorties against the enemy.^ :   As regards, (a), the Committee should take/the number ofV&amp;st-line aircraft on the 12th July, 1943; aiid, as regardssorties against the enemy, the secOnd Quarter of ,1943.&apos;&apos; s...V  He reminded the War Cabinet that a special Enquiry had beenheld into the use of man-power by the War Office about eight months ago.(g) Discussion then turned on the Memorandum, by the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security, in which he undertook to effect a further reduction of 15,000 in the whole-time personnel of the Civil Defence Services (including the Police and national fire Service)-by the end of 1943, over and above the reductionalready planned. This reduction would be difficult to achieve, butin the circumstances he was prepared to give effect to it.The Minister of Health said, that, so far as concerned theservices for which he was responsible, he thought that no further reduction could be made in London, and that the reduction wouldhave to fall on other districts.The Secretary of State for Scotland said.that, while he couldnot see his way to make any reduction in Scottish Police Forces, hewould collaborate in securing reductions in the Fire Service and civil Defence General Services in Scotland.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals made by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security in his Memorandum (W.P.*        (43) 326).The War Cabinefs conclusions as regards the distribution ofman-power up to the end of 1943 were as follows : ,-.(1) The numbers of full-time workers in Civil Defence(including Police and National Fire Service) should bereduced by a further 15,000 before the end of 1943, in:.: &apos; addition to the reduction of 75,000 now proceeding inaccordance with the decision taken by the War Cabinet. in 1942.       .    &apos;(2^ Subject to (1) above, no further increase could be made inthe estimate of 414,000 put forward in W.P. (43) 271as the total numbers likely to be available to meet the&apos; needs of the Services and essential industry during the.nine months from the 1st April to 31st December, 1943.The total supply of man-power during this period, should therefore be taken.as 429,000.(3) Subject to, (5) below, the allocations to the Army and theRoyal Air Force for the period the 1st April to31st; December, 1943, should be 145,000 and 100,000(4) The allocation to the Navy for the same period&apos;should be190,000.&apos; This would meet in full the balance of theallocation made to the Navy in December 1942, and-.s]tohld&apos;\ayto^^&apos;-&apos;&apos;r^arded--.:as *m&amp;ting-\.the. additional demand put forward by the Admiralty in respect of theman-power requirements of the Fleet itself.[25827-1] , ,       &apos;      .      b&apos; 2 .: -  .* ;
^ found, if at iallj f*dm the. humbersiialreadyv the three Services. ,. :The Chiefs of Staff were invited to consider to what extent the additionalnwnbers demanded by, theAdmiralty for manning landing craft were in fact): Essential for the success of a forthcoming operation, and how any additional numbers required should be provided from among those already allocated to the three Services.Special efforts must be made to expand the. labour forceworking for the Ministry of Aircraft Production by115,000 during the period the 1st April to 31st December,1943. The additional numbers required would. beobtained partly by a further reduction of the labour force working for the Ministry of Supply and partly by drawing into aircraft production young women whowould otherwise have gone into the Services.For this purpose, the immediate introduction of thefollowing measures was authorised : (a) Intake into the Women&apos;s Services to be reducedto a minimum by (i) stopping volunteering,save for some special posts; (ii) not making any further age-groups Of women subject to conscription under the National Service Acts&apos; for the time being; and (iii) appealing to women already accepted for the Services togo into aircraft, factories until they were required in those Services:(6) Women up to age 50 inclusive to be registeredf or employment.(c).Ministry of Aircraft Production to be relieved-   of their obligation to return to the Royal AirForce mechanics who were lent to the aircraft industry.   Those still in the industry to beallowed to remain there for the time being.(d) In general, men on Ministry of aircraft production work not to be called up for theServices for the time being. (Sea-goingengineers required to man merchant shipsbuilt in the United States and assigned tothis country should; however, be released;)(e) Reductions in the labour force working for theMinistry of Supply to be carefully planned to take place as far as possible in areas wherethe Ministry of Labour can ensure that thelabour released is absorbed in Ministry, of aircraft Production work. For this&quot;purpose, the Ministry of Aircraft Produc-tiori ito make available statements showingwhere their labour intake is required up tothe end of the year.The labour to be released from Ministryof Supply work must, to the greatest practic-able extent, be mobile labour. ;(/) Regional&apos;Controllers of the Ministry of Labour&quot;to be instructed to make special efforts to fillMinistry of Aircraft Production vacancies,and for this1 purpose Miijistry of aircraft production: M ofLabour each month, through their Regional- Controllers, - a list of &apos; vacancies \must be-filled,during^
(7) In addition to these measures, the Minister of Production,in conjunction with the;, other Ministers concerned,\        should endeavour toarrange block transfers of orders or&quot;capacity^ M between the Ministry of(8);;Thfe&apos;Min at securing that thelabour force working for his Department is reduced bya totaj of!&apos;!i$&amp;;.0pp:;d^ihg&apos;the period from the 1st April: to&apos;31st December; 1943.;(9) The labour force oh Admiralty work should be increasedby 50,000 during the period from the 1st April to31st December, 1943.&apos;   .(10) TheMinister of^ Production should arrange to hold regular meetings with the Ministers of Labour, Supply and aircraft Production and the First Lord of theAdmiralty with a view to keeping under continuous review the progress of these arrangements for; trans-V:   ;     ferring man-power and productive effort to aircraft production.   The aim of these meetings wditld be toascertain the most urgent man-power needs of theMinistry of Aircraft Production and to see that no&apos; possible means of meeting those needs was overlooked.(11) No more than 70,000 men and women would be available tomeet the requirements of the other Essential industries and Services, stated in the Appendix to W.P. (43) 271as totalling 102,000.The Lord President of the Council was authorisedto distribute a cut of 32,000 among the various industries and services included within this group.The Departments responsible for the industries and services in this group should take steps to ensure that none of the industries and services for which they areresponsible absorbs, before the end of 1943, man-power in excess of the numbers to be allocated to it by the lord president of the Council.(12) The arrangements set out by the Minister of Production in w.P. (43) 311 for finding additional labour for theGovernment building programme during the months ofAugust and September 1943 were approved.(13) The intakes into the Services, and the net changes in industry for the period from the 1st April to31st December, 1943, were approved by the War cabinet as follows: Thousands.Navy      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      190ArmyR.A.F.Admiralty (shipbuilding,-&amp;c.)supply ministry of Aircraft Production14510050185115Other essential industries and services       70q   &apos; 485Supply       ...      ...      ...      ...      429.......Deficit       ...      ...      ...      ...       56(14) The administrative arrangements made by the Minister ofLabour to give effect to this redistribution of man-power should be such as to ensure that, if the supply up to theend of 1943 proved insufficient to meet all the require-ments set out in (13) above, the deficit should not fallon the Ministry of Aircraft Production. The Services,should not, therefore, be allowed to absorb the bulk oftheir authorised allocations in the early part of theremaining period; and the expansion actually achieved

(43) 98thConclusions,Minute 3.)2: The -War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord Privy Seal (WP. (43) 325), reporting that he and hiscolleagues on the Ministerial Committee felt that a serious attempt. should be made to obtain the participation of the Canadian Govern-ment in a preliminary; meeting before the proposed international conference took place..   :  ;:&apos; ), The conclusion had been reached that the best way of dealingwith the matter would be to meet them over the status of the Inter-national Conference. We should agree that, in general,4 the work could appropriately be undertaken by officials, working under General instructions from their respective Governments, although,for our part, we would propose that the United Kingdom delegation should be led by a Junior Minister.We should, however, press the Canadian Government to agree,on their side, to participate in a prior meeting in London of commonwealth and Indian representatives. We should proposethat these should be. the High Commissioners, with the addition ofsuch technical advisers as they might wish to send. This conference would be held not more than a fortnight before the proposed Inter-national Conference, and would not be announced or accorded anypublicity.The War Cabinet-- ,Endorsed these proposals and agreed that they should be conveyed to the Canadian Government in a letter from theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the CanadianHigh Commissioner, in reply to the latter&apos;s communication of the 12th July.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,22nd July, 1943:&quot; Note.-By a decision of the War Cabinet on the 19th August   1943; (W.M. (43). 117th; Conclusions, Minute 1) it was agreed that&quot; the first sentence of paragraph (14) should he modified so as to read:-&apos; In the administrative arrangements,made to give effect to thisredistribution of maA-power every endeavour should be made toavoid a. situation m Which, if the supply up to the end of 1943proved insufficient to.
