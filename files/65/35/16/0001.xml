reciprocal aid to&apos;theUnited States,(PreviousBeferenea:;W.M. (43) 8thConclusions,Minute 2.).1. The WaChancellor of thereeiprocal aid to the United StatesCabinet considered a Memorandum by the:Exchequer (W.P. (43) 331) on the subject ofThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in mid-August thePresident of the United States had to present to Congress his report on Lend-Lease, and in this connection was asking us to maketwo substantial concessions:- &quot;V(i) that we should give some valuation of Our own reciprocal.     aid to the United States; and(ii) that in future no payment should be demanded for rawmaterials and food-stuffs supplied to the United Statesfrom the British Commonwealth.Both the United States Administration and His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment had been anxious to keep questions of value out of reciprocal aid; but there were indications that pressure from Congress wouldmake it impossible to maintain this position. It was difficult toavoid discussions of values when Congress was asked for&apos; appropriations. Moreover, the American War Department had recently been instructed to set a value on all reciprocal aid given by foreign Governments; and, in the absence of better information, the data obtained by these means would be made available to Congress.These would inevitably be both incomplete and misleading. TheChancellor of the Exchequer therefore proposed that we should issue a White Paper describing the general principles oh whichresources had been pooled by lend-lease and reciprocal aid, and giving the broad picture of the reciprocal aid given by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, not only to theUnited States, but to the other United Nations. On this presenta-tion our contribution would compare much less unfavourably withthat of the United States.* At the same time we should encourage the Governments of theDominions and India to give similar information to the UnitedStates Administration regarding their contribution.It was proposed that the White Paper should be presented toParliament during the following week.The present position as regards raw materials was that, apartfrom tobacco, most raw materials and food-stuffs supplied to us bythe United States, both for the Forces and for consumption by thecivil population, were supplied on lend-lease, while the rawmaterials and food-stuffs supplied to the United States by membersof the British Commonwealth fell outside reciprocal aid. TheUnited States Administration were urging that, in order to demonstrate more fully the principle of reciprocity, we should agree in future to supply these materials under reciprocal aid. their request related only to purchases made by the United StatesGovernment, and would probably involve supplies to the value ofabout  50 million a year.The greater part- of this amount came from the Colonies, theDominions and India. It was suggested that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom should assume financial responsibility for the contributions made by the Colonies. The samearrangement could be applied to Southern Rhodesia if their Govern-inent so desired. The Governments of other Dominions and of india should be invited to conclude their own agreements with the UnitedStates, though we should explain the; policy which we are adoptingso that they should be in no doubt as to what we hoped- they would do. As regards our financial obligation to the Dominions, we, already had an arrangement with Australia and New Zealand bywhich we kept their sterling balances up to an agreed figure; andif they found themselves in financial difficulties as a result of theproposed new agreement with the United States we should have toconsider their representations. South Africa should not find any difficulty in financing such an arrangement. India, equally, shouldhot need any assistance from us; though, if the reciprocal aid givenby India were to exceed substantially the amount of lend-lease[25844-2] &apos; -    b 2 .  .
assistance which they received, we might have tb consider whether we should provide sterling for the excess. ,There were some countervailing advantages which we might expect to obtain by this proposed extension of our reciprocal aid.First, the United States Administration would probably be readyto agree that, in the new circumstances; no further account need betaken of the assurances given in the White Paper (Cmd. 63X1) aboutthe use of material in short-supply for the purposes of our exporttr^ade. Secondly, the practice of supplying us with tobacco on lend-lease terms might be resumed, with a consequent saving to us of155 million a year. Thirdly, those of our Colonies which would befurnishing reciprocal aid might no longer be excluded from fulllend-lease facilities on the ground that they were not in thecombat area.The conclusion of these new arrangements for including ourraw materials under our reciprocal aid would have an effect on our gold and dollar balances, the position of which was set out inparagraphs 24 to 34 of W.P. (43) 331. Certain sections of opinion in the United States were suspicious about these balances, andfounded their arguments on the size of the balances without regardto the liabilities ^against which they were held. A CabinetCommittee had recently been set up in the United States to considerwhether some ceiling should not be fixed for the growth of thesebalances. It was suggested that this opportunity should be taken of putting it on record that the state of our gold and dollar balancesWas not open to criticism, and that we trusted that this problem would not be raised by the United States Administration in thenear future. It was proposed that a full statement of the position,dealing particularly with our external liabilities, should be com-municated to the United States Administration. The text of this proposed statement was set out in Appendix II of W.P. (43) 331. &apos;In discussion general agreement was expressed with the viewof the Chancellor of the Exchequer that in present circumstances the proposals set out in W.P. (43) 331 were inevitable.The question was raised what conversion factor would be usedto express the relative value of American lend-lease and Britishreciprocal aid. The comparison would be misleading if our contri-bution was expressed in terms of sterling and was then comparedwith the American contribution expressed in terms of their price level. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this point hadbeen dealt with in a paragraph of the White Paper which he undertook to show to the Minister of Production and the lord president of the Council.The Paymaster-General suggested that it might be helpful if our contribution might be expressed in terms of man-years of productive effort. The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook toconsider this suggestion.The Secretary of State for India suggested that the second paragraph of paragraph (c) of the draft statement for communica-tion to the United States Administration, reproduced inAppendix II of W.P. (43) 331, might be amended so as to read : &quot; In the case of India, for example, it is estimated thatthis country will, by the end of this year, have.spent since thebeginning of the war $3,400 million on materials and munitionssupplied by India for the general purposes of the war and forthe. services of Indian troops outside India, of which$680 million will have been used to discharge her Governmenfssterling debt, and the balance will remain owing to her.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to consider thissuggested amendment.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs asked that noticeof these proposals should be given to Dominion (governments, ifpossible one week in advance of the date on which they were presented to the United States Government. ;  -,; i
The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals set; out in W.P. (43) 831, viz. :-] (i)* The claim for statistics of reciprocal aid should bemet by the presentation of a White Paper on thelines indicated in paragraph 11 of the Memo-randum.(ii) His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom* should agree that raw materials from thiscountry, the Colonies and Southern Rhodesiashould be given as reciprocal aid; and should invite the United States Administration tosuggest a similar arrangement to the Governmentsof Australia, New Zealand, South Africa andIndia, who would be informed of our policy.British shipping services for the carriage of these materials from all parts of the British Common- -wealth would be given as reciprocal aid.(iii) A statement of our views on the question of our gold and dollar balances should be communicatedto the United States Administration in the termsof Appendix II of W.P. (43) 331.(2) Agreed that the substance of these proposals should becommunicated by the Secretary of State for theDominions to Dominion Governments in advance of theirpresentation to the United States Government.India. 2.   Arising out of Minute 1, discussion took place on the war war Financial financial settlement of 1940 with India, and Indian SterlingSettlement of   Balances.1940, and It was pointed out in the Chancellor of the Exchequers paperIndian Sterling on Reciprocal Aid to the United States (W.P. (43) 331) that by farBalances. the largest iteni in the aggregate overseas liabilities oi the United(Previous Kingdom was the growing debt to India. We now had to meet the reference- greater part of our expenditure in India by borrowing rupees fromWM (42) 129th tne Government of India, against the provision here of sterling. as conclusions a resuto* ^e sterling balances of the Government of India,Minute 2) &apos; including those of the Reserve Bank, would have risen from about 58 million at the end of December 1939 to  745 million at the endof this year.  This liability was still increasing rapidly.The Prime Minister said that he regarded this as the one blackspot in our arrangements for the financing of the war. All theexperience at the end of the last war showed that these largeburdens of indebtedness between nations poisoned relations with countries and led to an intolerable situation.   It was impossible totransfer very large sums from one country to another, and anyattempt on our part to make repayment on this scale must, in thelast resort, result in putting an unbearable burden on the backs ofBritish workpeople.&apos; He entered a plea that the broad equities............ which had led President Roosevelt to establish the principle of. .        lend-lease should apply to the war effort of the United Nations as.        a whole.The Prime Minister said that he thought that we ought to reserve the right to put in a counter-claim in respect of all that wehad done to defend India from conquest by Japan., In any event,he was not prepared to take the responsibility of this situationcontinuing without Parliament being informed of our increasing* .     -liability.The Secretary of State for India said that, whatever theimprovement in her prospective position, India had so far beenimpoverished, rather than enriched, as a result of the war. india had produced - goods and services for the war effort, and hadreceived in exchange not goods, but a promise of payment at a later date. He qffered ho objection to Parliament being informed of the
position. (The Chancellor of the Exchequer interposed that he had given some indications of the, position in his last Budget Speech)The Secretary Of State for India addedj however, that the Indianview of the settlement of 1940 was that it had proved to be far more onerous, on them than they had contemplated. Furthermore,we were not in a position to secure a more favourable agreement orto compel Indians to produce goods for the war effort, and, if wewere to state that we proposed to put in a counter-claim, the only result would be that India would cease to manufacture the. war supplies which we now drew from her. The whole problem shouldbe deferred until the end of the war, or at any rate for so long as india&apos;s co-operation in men and supplies was essential to itsprosecution. -The discussion which ensued showed general support for theview that our growing indebtedness to India seemed to be developingon lines not unlike our indebtedness to the United States in the last war.&quot; This was a*dangerous situation which called for careful examination by the War Cabinet. The view was also expressed that,with the progress of the war, the fundamentals of the position had changed. No one had ever contemplated a situation in which weshould be piling up a, heavy indebtedness to India:At the same time it was recognised that the position was verycomplex. Thus the Minister of Labour and National Service feltthat no decision should be reached on this matter until the whole position, of which India&apos;s growing sterling balances was but onefactor, had been examined comprehensively. Further, it would be undesirable that any public statement should be made on the matteruntil the War Cabinet had reached a decision as to the policy to be pursued.There was also recognition of the undesirability of taking, any action which might look like unilateral repudiation of a bargain,and which might lead to a reduction in the volume of goods and services which India was now contributing to the War.The War Cabinet- &quot;(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit a comprehensive Memorandum to the War Cabinet dealingwith the war financial settlement of 1940, and the growth of India&apos;s sterling balances in relation to Indians general financial and economic position, together with proposalsfor meeting the situation disclosed by * our growingindebtedness to India.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in connectionwith this enquiry to prepare a Note as to the extent towhich this country could export goods to India after thewar in repayment of our indebtedness.Mutual Aid 3.   The War Cabinet considered a Joint Memorandum by theAgreement Secretary of State, for Foreign Affairs, the Chancellor of the(Previous Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade (W.P. (43) 329),Reference: suggesting that the time was now ripe for an attempt to reachW.M. (42) 55th preliminary agreement with the United States Government on allConclusions, the subjects covered by Article 7 of the Mutual Aid Agreement.Minute l.) It was proposed that in the first instance a telegram should besent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington, in the terms ofthe draft set out&apos;in the Annex to the Memorandum,, suggesting thatinformal and exploratory talks should begin forthwith, over thewhole field covered by Article 7, and that, subject to the views ofthe United States Government, we should send to Washington not later than the first half of September a strong delegation of officialsled by a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State which would be capable of dealing with all these subjects and, in particular, mone-tary policy, international investment, the regulation of primary products and commercial policy. The primary object of-these talkswould be to obtain broad agreement between the two governments and ah orderly Agenda for the discussion of Article 7.
Approved the. proposals in W.P. (48) 8219 and invited theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs&apos; to send a telegram to His Majesty.&apos;s Ambassador at Washington in the terms set out in the Annex to that Memorandum. &apos;Policy^:,&quot;&apos;.:&apos;(previous reference:W.M. (43) 58thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. AttheirMeeting onthe^^22hd April, the War Cabinet had agreed that the Governments of the Dominions and India should beinvited to send officials to discuss in London the proposed approach to the&apos;United States Government on post-war commercial policy.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (W.P, (43) 334) stating that theresults of these discussions, which had taken place in London fromthe .15.th to 30th June, had been considered by a Committee ofMinisters, under the Chairmanship of the Chancellor of theExchequer, which had agreed&apos; that we- should now be justified inopening discussions On this question with representatives of theUnited States Government. There was attached to the Memoranduman aide-memoire for presentation to the United States representa-tives, and an Outline of Proposals which could be used as a briefby the British representatives &quot;and might at an appropriate stage be handed to the United States representatives as-an informaldocument illustrating one way in which the principles embodied inthe aide-memoire might take shape.It was suggested that these discussions on commercial policy might take their place in the general approach which it was proposedto make to the United States Government on all the subjects coveredby Article 7 of the Mutual Aid Agreement (see preceding Minute).The Secretary of State for India expressed a doubt whetherthe proposed policy would commend itself to India, which was likely to wish to pursue a definitely protectionist policy after thewar.  Personally, he regarded the proposals as entirely opposed to&quot; our interests, but did not think that anything would come of them.The President of the Board of Trade, however, said that theattitude of Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar, who had taken part in discussions on behalf of the Government of India, was that he wasin general agreement with the proposed policy.The War Cabinet-Approved the two documents annexed to W.P. (43) 334for use in the discussion on commercial policy in the courseof the general talks with United States representatives onall the subjects covered by Article-7 of the Mutual aid agreement.Parliament.Dates ofRecess.(previous reference:W.M.(42)92n&amp;Conclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said it was proposed that Parliament should rise on Thursday, the 5th August,and should reassemble on Tuesday, the 21st September.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs tomake arrangements accordingly.Rat.6. The War Cabinet approved a proposal that the LordChancellor, in consultation with the Home Secretary and MinisterOf Home Security, and Parliamentary Counsel, should prepare and submit to the War Cabinet a draft Bill amending the Regency Act,19.37; so as to provide that the heir presumptive to the throne shouldbe qualified to be a Counsellor of State on attaining &apos; the age of 18.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,27tk july, 1943. \   V
