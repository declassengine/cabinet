The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bad weather had restricted the activities of Bomber Commandto one attack on Munich and to bombing operations in occupied territory in connection with the recent Exercise. Coastal command had made five attacks on U-boats. Our losses during the week hadbeen 16 bombers, 22 fighters and tactical air force aircraft and3 Coastal Command aircraft.United States aircraft had attacked Stuttgart and other targets in that area, losing 45 aircraft.Airfields and transportation targets had been attacked in Italy.The total enemy aircraft claimed to be destroyed was 166 asagainst 37 of ours.In the operations near Lae the Japanese had lost 49 aircraftas against 17 by the Allies.There had been no shipping losses during the previous week.An air reconnaissance showed no sign of life at the Spitzbergensettlement following the recent German attack.Italian warships from Spezia and Taranto had arrived at malta on the 10th and 11th September following the Italiansurrender. Other warships and merchant ships were still coming in, but full details had not yet been received.The Eighth Army, advancing up the toe of Italy, had now reached the line Cotrone, Cosenza and Amante. In the heel ofItaly Allied forces had occupied Taranto and had advanced somedistance to the north-east of the latter place. In the Bay of SalernoBritish and American forces had made a landing on the morning of the 9th September, and now occupied a rather narrow bridgeheadon a front of some 45 miles. A number of German counter-attacks had been repulsed; but the enemy&apos;s resistance was stiffening and atone point our troops had been driven out of their positions. Thesituation for the next two or three days would be an anxious one.We had occupied the island of Castel Rosso, but Rhodes andCrete appeared to be firmly held by the Germans.The Japanese troops at Salaniaua had been practicallysurrounded. Allied troops were also closing in on Lae from theeast and west.In the south the two main Russian thrusts were driving theGermans towards the Dnieper Bend. The Russians had capturedBakhmach and there had been minor thrusts north and south ofBriansk. It looked as if the Germans would now be driven backto the line of the Dnieper. The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that M. Maisky had informed him that the Russianshoped to continue their present offensive for another month.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Italy.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 126thConclusions.)armistice terms.2. The Secretary of State.for Foreign Affairs reminded theWar Cabinet that the representatives of General Eisenhower andGeneral Badoglio had signed the short armistice terms. These terms(which had now been published) were mainly military, but contained a. clause to the effect &apos;&apos; that other conditions of a political, economicand financial nature with which Italy will be bound to comply willbe transmitted at a later date.&quot; The longer document embodyingthese financial, economic and political clauses had been agreed withthe United States Government, but had not been signed by theItalian plenipotentiaries.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that this might lead to. some embarrassment. He therefore proposed to telegraph to Mr. Macmillan, pointing out the desirability of MarshalBadoglio being asked to sign these terms.[26082]b 2
Italian Warshipsat Alexandria.Italianrepresentativesat Lisbon.The point was made that, as General Eisenhower had statedpublicly that certain of the clauses contained in the shorterarmistice terms could not now be complied with, this course mightnot be altogether easy.The War Cabinet nevertheless agreed that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should put this suggestion toMr. Macmillan.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegrams from Our Ambassador at Cairo and from the Commanders-in-chief in the Middle East about the treatment to be accorded to Italianpersonnel and ships reaching the Middle East as a result of theItalian surrender. These telegrams pointed out the serious difficulties which would arise if the sailors of the Italian fleet were allowed to land, since there was a growing demand for release of italian civilian internees; and there were also many italian prisoners of war in Egypt.The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War Cabinetthat clear instructions had been issued as to the precautions whichshould be observed in regard to Italian warships arriving at alexandria.The War Cabinet invited the Vice-Chief of Naval Staff, inconsultation with the Foreign Office, to arrange for instruc-tions to be sent to the Middle East, to the effect that crews of Italian warships reaching Alexandria should remain on their ships.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that two italian professors had arrived at Lisbon and had explained that theywere charged with a mission, partly economic and partly political,duly authorised by the Italian Government. They were also anxiousto make contact with Labour circles in London.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had given instructions that if these two representatives wished to discusseconomic matters they should go to Algiers.  This they had done.The question whether these representatives should be allowedto come to London later on was postponed by the War Cabinet forfurther consideration when the relative telegrams had been circulated. The view was, however, expressed that there was muchto be said for all discussions with representatives of the BadoglioGovernment being carried out wherever that Government was nowto be established.ItalianArmistice.Effect of publicity.3. The Minister of Aircraft Production said that he had visited a number of factories over the week-end. In all of them hehad been impressed with the very serious effect on the war effort ofthe announcement that Italy had signed an armistice. In manyfactories work was proceeding almost as if the war was over. Somecorrective was urgently needed. He thought that the extent and nature of the publicity extended to this event by the B.B.C. had contributed somewhat to this state of affairs.The War Cabinet-Agreed that this point should be brought to the notice ofthe Ministry of Information, and expressed the hope thatthis matter would be among those dealt with by the PrimeMinister in his statement to Parliament in the following week.
4. The Secretary of State for War said that, as a result of theArmistice with Italy, Italian prisoners of war in this country were asking Camp Commandants about their future. Unless a suitableanswer was given, there was a risk that they might become discon-tented and that their work would be affected.The War Cabinet-Agreed that this matter should be considered later in theweek, in conjunction with a Memorandum circulated by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (43) 392).5. One of the armistice terms signed by Italy was that all prisoners would be immediately turned over to the allied commander-in-Chief and that none would be evacuated to Germany.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that largenumbers of prisoners had been released and told to make their wayto the south or, in the case of North Italy, to the Swiss frontier.Very considerable numbers were on their way to the Swiss frontier,and this matter had been discussed by our Minister at Berne withthe Swiss Government. In view of the large numbers concerned, ithad been agreed that the escaped prisoners reaching Switzerlandmight for the present be placed in camps under a measure of control.In view of the numbers concerned, this was not an unreasonableprovision. The main object must, of course, be to do all we could to facilitate the escape of our prisoners.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement. &apos;6. The War Cabinet were given the latest information inregard to this Conference.7: The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, if anyof his colleagues should meet Mr. Carl Hambro, the President of theNorwegian Parliament, he thought that they ought to be aware ofthe fact that certain of his recent activities had shown him to benot very well disposed towards this country.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.8. At their Meeting on the 19th July the War Cabinet had invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to submit a reportindicating what measures and what military forces might berequired in order to ensure that the frontier between Kenya and ethiopia was effectively guarded. After consultation with theGovernor of Kenya and discussion with the General Officer Com-manding, East Africa, the Secretary of State for the Colonies had now submitted a report (W.P. (43) 390). This indicated that therehad been some improvement in the frontier position, which, however,might well be only temporary. The Secretary of State for theColonies thought that, before proceeding to any drastic action, theEmperor should be given one more opportunity to prove that his administration was capable of discharging Abyssinia&apos;s inter-national responsibilities in this region.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he agreed;with the action proposed, except that he-would prefer that we should-not, at this stage, threaten the Emperor with the temporaryoccupation by British forces of a portion of territory north of thefrontier if the action taken by the Emperor did not prevent raidsinto Kenya territory. He would omit the words after &quot; BoranaProvince &apos;&apos; in the second sub-paragraph of paragraph 6, but would strengthen the earlier part of the sub-paragraph.General agreement was expressed with this view, but it was thought that the General Officer Commanding, East Africa, shouldnot, on that account, discontinue the preparation of plans for inter-vention across the frontier should that course be decided upon later.The view was also expressed that, until there had been somerectification of the Kenya-Ethiopian frontier, troubles were boundto be recurrent. It was therefore not too soon to consider what action could be taken in this matter.The War Cabinet&apos;s Conclusions were as follows : (1) It should be made quite clear to the Emperor that we werenot prepared to allow the present situation on thefrontier to continue, and that we looked to him to ensurethat during the approaching&quot; season such action wastaken in Southern Ethiopia as would effectively preventraids into Kenya territory. We should indicate at thesame time that, if this object was not achieved, we should feel bound to propose to him that action should be taken,in co-operation by British and Ethiopian forces, to clear up the centres of trouble within the Borana Province.(2) The Governor of Kenya should, with the additional policeat his disposal, through the replacement of guards inother parts of the Colony by the military, strengthen thesecurity arrangements along the frontier as far aspossible; and the General Officer Commanding-in-Chiefshould continue with the preparation of plans for inter -vention across the frontier if that course should later bedecided upon by His Majesty&apos;s Government.(3) The  Secretary of  State  for  Foreign Affairs  and the,Secretary- of State for the Colonies would examine the;possibility of setting up an Anglo-Ethiopian FrontierCommission at a fairly early date, with a view to. a;rectification of the present unsatisfactory frontier.   . . -9. The War Cabinet were informed by the First Lord of theAdmiralty about the labour unrest in Malta. There had been asettlement last November, when the total minimum payment of work-people generally, in Government employ, had been increased to 385.a week. The present demand put forward by the men was for anincrease to 67s. a week. This figure was apparently based on thecurrent cost of food, with an estimated allowance for other cost-of-living factors. The Governor had made an offer to the men to raisethe figure to 59s. 8d.   This offer had been refused.The matter had been discussed at an interdepartmental meeting-of officials held that morning. At this meeting it had been decidedthat a concession should be made in regard to certain employees now,paid as juveniles. It had also been decided that certain other,enquiries should be set on foot.The strike, which had lasted 4 or 5 days, had been an;unofficial one, and was not authorised by the men&apos;s leaders. Theymen were now back at work.The Lord Privy Seal, acting for the Secretary of State for theColonies, said that he thought that the right course was that the revised subsidy arrangements proposed should be introduced at once:This was equivalent to an increase of 11s. Sd. a week in the men&apos;s-wages.
29W.M. 127 (43).127General agreement was expressed with this suggestion.The question was also raised as to whether it would not bedesirable to send out to Malta some person or persons skilled in wages questions and industrial negotiations. The Lord Privy Sealundertook to consider this suggestion.-   The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements and of the action proposed.Lease-Lend. 10.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he thought he(Previous ought to draw the attention of his colleagues to a statement made reference: by the President at a Press Conference, which had appeared in theW.M. (43) 112th New York Times of the 8th September.Conclusions, The Eleventh Report to Congress on Lease-Lend OperationsMinute 2.) had contained a covering letter by the President,  dated  the25th August, 1943, which had included the following statement: &apos;&apos; The Congress, in passing and extending the Lease-LendAct, made it plain that the United States wants no new war debt to jeopardise the coming peace. Victory and a securepeace are the only coin in which we can be repaid.&quot;The President had stated that this letter had not had his approval, and that he had objected to these two sentences as acondensation of the truth, which might lead to misunderstanding.He had also said that, while the United States did not necessarilyexpect repayment of Lease-Lend advances in dollars, it was histhought, and that of most of the other countries, that they wouldrepay all that they possibly could.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in making this statement the President had, in some degree at any rate, recededfrom his former position.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Parliament. 11.   The War Cabinet had a provisional discussion as to business of the  business when the House reassembled in the following week.House.(previous reference:W.M.(43) 106thConclusions,Minute 5.)The following Conclusions were reached ;  (1) There should be a two-days Debate on the War Situation,followed by a two-days Debate on the Man-power situation. Thereafter the House would adjourn for afurther short Recess. It followed that the Debate on civil Aviation, which had been provisionally arranged to take place in the House of Lords in the week beginningthe 27th September, would be deferred to a later date.(2) The provisional Conclusion was reached that on the present occasion it would be preferable that the Debate on theWar Situation should take place on the Adjournmentrather than on a specific Motion. It was, however,unnecessary to reach a final Conclusion on this matter atthis juncture.(3) The Debate on the Man-Power Situation should be openedby a Government Statement; but a final decision as towhich Ministers should open and wind up on behalf ofthe Government was postponed.If, as was expected, attacks were made during the debate on the Civil Service, the Chancellor of theExchequer undertook to reply on this point.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,13th September, 1943.

NO CIRCULATIONY/.M. (45)  127th CONCLUSIONS.  MINUTE 615th September. 1945,  5.50 p. m.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that,as the result of a further exchange of telegrams,   it had now been agreed that the Conference of Foreign Secretarieswould he held, not in this country, but in Moscow.It seemed that America would probably he represented by Mr.  Sumner Welles and Mr. Harriman.      The suggestion hadbeen made that the Conference should start on the 4thOctober.      The Foreign Secretary said that he did notthink that it would be possible for the Conference to start as soon as this,  as there were a number of important matters which would have to be settled after the PrimeMinister&apos;s return to this country.The Foreign Secretary deprecated the American,.,attitude that no important Conference, attached by U. S.representatives    could be held in London.      Sooner or later,  we should have to take a firm stand on this point.The Foreign Secretary also thought that the UnitedStates authorities did not realise how anxious the U. S.S.R.were that this Conference should get down to business.Thus, when we had communicated to the United states authorities &quot;our ideas of the sort of questions whichshould be discussed at the Conference,   they had indicated that they thought matters should be dealt with on more general lines.The war Cabinet took note of this statement.War Cabinet, S.W.I.
