1. The War Cabinet considered Memoranda by the Secretaryof-State for the,Colonies and,the Chancellor of the Exchequer(X.P. (43) 185 and 189) about the extension of the InternationalRubber Regulation Agreement, which was due to expire on jthe31st December, 1943;     iThe Secretary of. State for the Colonies said that in May lasthe had seen representatives of the Dutch Government and Britishrubber interests, and, with the concurrence of all the Departments,concerned, had indicated that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to extend the Agreement for one year. The Treasury had now suggested that the matter should be reconsidered, in the lightof the statements of policy in respect of commodity regulation whichhad been made at the Food Conference at Hot Springs.   1The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was deeply committed by the statements already made earlier in the year to theDutch Government and the British interests involved, and it would undoubtedly shake their confidence now if we decided to go backon those statements. Such a decision would make it much moredifficult to get the Dutch to co-operate with us in any alternativeplans for commodity control schemes; and, as regards Britishinterests, would be regarded as a deliberate desertion of the rubberindustry. The effect of such a decision would not be confined to the rubber industry, for other industries (e.g., tea, sugar and tin)operating under similar Agreements would feel no confidence in theintention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to maintain the agreements with which they were concerned.The Secretary of State for the Colonies therefore proposed thatthe Agreement should be renewed for one year, but that a statementof policy should at the same time be issued in the terms of the draft annexed to his Memorandum. This would make it clear that therewas no intention to revive any of the restrictive provisions of theAgreement, and that the extension was designed solely to prevent an undesirable breach in the continuity of the machinery of theexisting Agreement pending an opportunity for international discussion of the whole question on a wider basis in the light ofthe neW conditions resulting from the war.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he recognised that it would be embarrassing for the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies to go back on the assurances which he had already given, this question must be considered in relation to the present stage of our discussions with the United States Government on post-war economic policy. At the Food Conference at Hot Springsour delegates had given a preliminary indication of our proposals inthe field of post-war commodity policy, and had made it clear that,while quantitative commodity regulation schemes might on occasionbe necessary as emergency remedies, we rejected the idea that such schemes were suitable long-term solutions for commodity problems.We were now about to enter into important general discussions oncommodity questions with the United States Administration, inwhich we hoped to secure their support for an expansionist policy.This particular scheme of commodity regulation had always beensuspect in the United States, and its renewal on the eve of thosegeneral economic discussions would be bound to prejudice our prospects of securing the support of the United States Administra-tion for our general economic plans.It was common ground that we should not wish to continueafter the war the same restrictions on rubber production as were in-force before the war; and the main reason for renewing the Agree-ment was to preserve in being the machinery for co-operationbetween the producers of natural rubber. The Chancellor askedwhether it would not be possible to find sOme ad hoc means of preserving this machinery without &apos; formally renewing theAgreement.The Minister of Production suggested that this point might bemet by renewing only those clauses in the Agreement which providedfor the establishment of the machinery of control.   This wouldInternational.RubberRegulation ..-Agreement.

It waspointed out that there was no question of restriction of rubberproduction during the war, and that for some years after the wara restrictive policy was not likely to be in the interests of the\ industry. At the same time, it was desirable that the producers of natural rubber should retain an organisation capable of safe-guarding their common interests; and from this point of view therewas much to be said for maintaining the machinery established under the Agreement.The Secretary of State for the Colonies suggested that, if theAgreement was to be preserved only for this limited purpose, this&apos; decision should be explained to the Dutch Government and theBritish rubber interests by a Member of the War Cabinet, in orderthat it might be made clear&apos;that the earlier decision&apos;had been modified by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the light of developments in their consideration of post-war economic policy as a whole.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows(1) The International Rubber Regulation Agreement shouldnot be renewed in its entirety. In particular, thereshould be no renewal of the restrictive clauses of theAgreement..(2)&apos; At the same time, it was desirable that the producers of natural rubber should retain an organisation capable of safeguarding their common interests; and for thispurpose steps, should be taken to continue in being themachinery for consultation and co-qperation established under the Agreement. It might be convenient to do thisby renewing those clauses of the Agreement which provided for the establishment of this machinery.(3) The Minister of Production, the Chancellor of . theExchequer, the Secretary of State for the Colonies andthe President of the Board of Trade should consider the detailed steps necessary to preserve this machinery,while discontinuing the restrictive clauses of the Agree-. - ment; and. should also settle the terms in which thedecision should be announced to the interests primarily- -: concerned.(4) The Minister of Production should explain the decision inthe terms agreed as at (3) above to representatives of theDutch Government and the British rubber interests.Lease-Lend. 2.
