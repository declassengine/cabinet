The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had had further discussions with Dr. Benes and M, Maisky about theproposal that a Treaty should now be concluded between Russia and czechoslovakia, on the general lines of the Anglo-Russian Treaty.Dr. Benes seemed to be under the impression that the United StatesGovernment Were in favour of this proposal, but from enquiries which he had,made he (the Secretary of&apos; State for Foreign Affairs)thought that this was not the case.. M. Maisky was now putting forward the view that the self-denying ordinance that we had agreed with the Russians namely,that we should both refrain, from concluding Treaties with smallerStates covering the post-war period-1-did not apply to theconclusion of a Treaty -between-; Eussia and&apos; C zechoslovakia,- on: thegrounds that there was already ah Agreement .^tween th^se; twocountries, and that the Treaty contemplated, was only intended to^[25704]&apos; ^ b2

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that his chiefobjection to- the. conclusion now of a Treaty between Russia ahSChechoslovakia was that it would have a bad effect on- the PolisEsituation He^hought that the right course wasthat h^/shbuldinstruct^Sir A. Clark Kerr to seek an interview with MV-Molotov&quot;Our\Ambassadorshouldremind M, Molotov ofthe agreement whichwe had comej to in;this.matter. If, however, the Russian Govern-mentTemarned obdurate^ he thought that we should the taketheline that the proposed Treaty between Russia and Czechoslovakiashould be concluded m such a for-m that it would be an instalment of a three,Power Treaty, which could include Poland at a later date. We should also make it clear that we honed that there wouldbe no further exceptions to the self-denying ordinance.The War Cabinet-Agreed to the course proposed.Pauls PeaceConference.proposed publication ofrecords by united States-Government.- 6; The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (43)&apos;290), to whichWas annexed a Memorandum prepared in the Offices of the WarCabinet, regarding the proposal of the State Department to publish,as part of a series-of official documents on the foreign relations ofthe United States, the complete records of the Paris PeaceConference, 1919, including the. Minutes of the Meetings of theCouncil of Four.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention tothe arguments, summarised in paragraph -7 of the memorandum prepared in the Offices of the War Cabinet; against the publicationof the Minutes of the Council of Four. He felt sure that thepublication of these records was bound to have a cramping effect onany similar confidential discussions which it might be necessary tohold after the present war. He also thought it important to main-tain the distinction between diplomatic correspondence, which was concerned with the execution of policy, and Minutes and Memorandarelating to its formulation. On this basjs he felt that the Minutesof the Council of Four would be out of place in a collection;of documents primarily devoted to diplomatic correspondence......The War Cabinet endorsed the views expressed by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, and considered that a determined effort should be made to prevent the United States Government from publishing these records. &apos;The Prime Minister said that, if necessary, he would.beprepared to make personal representations to the President of theUnited States, who would, he thought, recognise the embarrassing position in which he himself might be placed, if these records were now published, in his private conversations with ther leadingstatesmen of the United Nations after the war.        kWdlk^ii^k-AThe War Cabihet-r-      r.y\: -&apos;Invited the Secretary of State.; for Foreign, yjpf^irsto;,represent , to the UnitedX-States, GovermnMt&apos;&apos; theinexpediency of jiujbi(i^b^ ^: $e^ds cpf [^e^Paf &amp;^eace.&apos;Conference, and in particular the Minutes of thev^ouncilof Four.      , i &apos;\:
(PreviousReferenceate 5.)The   War   Cabinet   had   before   them   the   Eeport;;;(V.P;.; (4S):-26Si)&apos; of the Committee a^pdintsfl to consider the future-.-of the Women&apos;s. Services and-the possibility of using the members&apos;o  these Serviees&apos; for post4w-a ,iV.M. (43) 12th        The   Committee&apos;s  recommendations  were  summarised   in conclusions,      paragraph 18 of their Report.   In the Appendix there was set Outthe draft of a statement, to be made in Parliament, to theeffect-that-: - . -&apos;. &apos; :&apos;(i) while the future organisation of the Womeny -Services,after general demobilisation^ could not yet be determined,it was clear that they would be needed for some time after hostilities had ceased, and in particular to accompany the Forces of Occupation; and that(ii) members of the Women&apos;s Services would be given anOpportunity to volunteer for appointments in theadministration of liberated territories during the periodOf military control.The War Cabinet-(1). Gave general approval to the recommendations made in theReport.(2) Agreed that a statement should be made in Parliament inthe terms of the draft annexed to the Report.BetentiomBarracks.Proposedenquiry intoconditions.8, The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Warrecalled that two non-commissioned officers had recently been convicted at Maidstone Assizes of causing the death of a soldierundergoing detention at a detention barracks at Chatham. the individuals concerned had been dealt with by the civil courts; and,in accordance with normal practice, a Military Court of Enquiryhad&apos; now been appointed to investigate the conditions at these particular barracks&apos; and the treatment of soldiers under sentencethere. This case had, however, aroused considerable feeling, and a motion had been tabled in the House of Commons calling for animmediate enquiry by a Select Committee into the conduct and organisation of military detention prisons, barracks and camps.A War Office enqury had been made some 20 months agointo the conditions at detention barracks generally; and there wasno reason to believe that conditions in these barracks generally wereunsatisfactory. At the same time it was desirable that public anxiety should be allayed. The scope of the Court of Enquiryalready appointed to report on the Chatham Barracks could beextended to cover conditions in military detention barracksgenerally; but Parliament and the public might not be content withthe findings of a purely military tribunal. On the other hand, an enquiry by a Select Committee would be inappropriate. In thesecircumstances it was suggested that an Enquiry might be held by a-Judge of the High Court.... The War,Cabinet agreed that it would be helpful if such an enquiry were held. The First Lord of the A dmiralty suggested thatits scope should be such as to include naval detention barracks.(It was explained that R.A.F. prisoners were accommodated inArmy detention barracks.)In discussion, it was suggested that the High Court Judgemight perhaps be assisted by two other persons of suitable standing and experience. Members of the Services might take part in theEnquiry as assessors.The War Cabinet  .Agreed that an Enquiry on these lines should be held into -. - conditions at navy and army-detention.barracks generally;and invited the Prime Minister to select suitable persons to conduct this Enquiry. &apos;
Offices of the War Cabinet, &apos;S.W.1,5th July, 1943.Bitote 9.   the Prime Mmisterm^y. &quot;&apos; had a telegram from the President (No. 302 of the 3rd July)srious :^n^^i^;&apos;^&apos;:1fe^t of a broadcast which he proposed to address to-rence:: the Italian people on the day w^ OperaMoh &quot; Husky&apos;&apos; tv^s%:M.(43)73rd launched. The Prime Minister read to the War. Cabinet a copy of conclusions, the proposed broadcast. . He said that he had given idng cori-Miriute I.)&apos; sMeratidri, in consultation with the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, to the reply Which should be sent. As the President had expressed a wish to send the hrbadcast himself to the Italian people and had drafted a message, he thought that it would be right to concur in this &quot;Course, subject to certain amendments which he would indicate later.The alternative had been considered of turning the declarationinto a joint declaration to be signed both by the President and himself, but the terms of the draft declaration did not lendthemselves to treatment in this way, without very substantial modification.Turning to the amendments which he proposed, the PrimeMinister said that he thought it was essential that words shouldbe inserted to make it clear that the President was speaking onbehalf of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government as well as of theUnited States Government. Furthermore, references must beinserted to General Alexander, as deputy to General Eisenhower,and to the British forces which would take part in this assault andwhich greatly outnumbered the American forces, both on land and sea, and in the air.The Prime Minister then read to the War Cabinet the terms ofthe reply which he proposed should be sent to the President.In the discussion which followed, amendments were agreedupon dealing with the following points :-(a) An addition should be made to paragraph 4(c) to include a specific reference to British sea power.(6) It would be better to omit the paragraph referring to thelarge number of United States citizens of Italian origin.While this fact afforded substantial justification for thePresident&apos;s proposal that he -should address a broadcast to the Italian people, United States opinion was sensi-tive to references to the radial origin of various sectionsof the American people.(c) The proposal that the message should be issued on &quot; D&quot;Day was clearly inappropriate, arid words in para-graph 5 implying that the Prime Minister was preparedto defer to the Presidents judgment on this matter should be omitted.The War Cabinet-Agreed tO the despatch to the President of the telegramdrafted by the Prime Minister,&apos; subject to the aboveamendments.(This telegram was despatched as No. 344, of the 5th July.)
