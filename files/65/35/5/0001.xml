\irreyious.,Rejereiic6:...WM. (43) 85thConclusions,Minute&apos;4.)&quot;&quot;X&quot;irCabinet had before them a M^ theLord President of the Council (W,P. *.(43).297); reporting the recom-mendations of the Lord Presidents Committee as to the changes which should be made in the present systerif of war pensions With aview to correcting anomalies and meeting legitimate grievances. Itwas proposed that these recommendations should be incorporated ina White Paper, to be presented to Parliament before the Debate onthe Ministry of Pensions Estimates. . . ,:The War Cabinet went through the Memorandum paragraphby.paragraph. The following were the main points in discussion &apos;:-r-,(a) It was explained that the. recommendations had been framedoh tne basis &quot;of securing a thoroughly satisfactory settlement ongenerous,lines, on which the Government could take a firm stand.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had approached thematter from the point of View that the war pensioner was deservingof special consideration, and that consequential improvements inother classes of emoluments would not necessarily follow from the improvements in war pensions now contemplated.(6) &quot; Fit for Service; fit for Pension &quot; .-. Onus of proof.-TheWar Cabinet agreed that the principle *&apos; Fit for Service; fit for pension &quot; should not be adopted, and were in general agreementwith the proposed revised clauses for incorporation in the royal warrant set out in paragraph 5 of the Memorandum.It was suggested, however, that it would be preferable that clause&apos; (1) should read as follows : 1&quot; &quot;The disablement or death of a member of the militaryforces shall be accepted as due to war service for the provisionsof this Our Warrant, provided it is certified that . . . .&quot;The adoption of this wording, in lieu of the wording set out inthe Memorandum, was subject to confirmation, after further consultation between the Attorney-General, the Minister of Pensionsand Parliamentary Counsel.(c) Post-Injury Marriage.-The War Cabinet agreed that thefull claim for recognition of all post-injury marriages must be resisted. It was felt that, on the whole, the special circumstancesof the disabled man who was unemployable could be differentiatedand treated as deserving of some exceptional concession.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Home affairs said that wives&apos; allowances were now to be introduced in Workmen&apos;compensation, and he thought that requests would be made for theextension to Workmen&apos;s Compensation of the principle of recognising post-injury marriage in the case of the totally disabledunemployable pensioner.&quot;The War Cabinet accepted the recommendations of theCommittee, but recorded the view that no extension could be con-templated to other persons or classes of the concession now proposedin the case of totally disabled and unemployable war-pensioned.(d) The Disabled Re-employed Service Pensioner-Withreference to paragraph 20 of the Memorandum, the First Lord ofthe A dmiralty referred to the treatment of the widows of retiredFlag Officers re-employed as Commodores.- The Prime Minister thought some concession was called for,and invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to raise this issue.The War Cabinet-   :Approved the recommendations set out in the Memorandumby the Lord President of the Council, subject only to theamendment referred to at &quot; X,&quot; &apos; and agreed that theseproposals should be incorporated in a White Paper to be presented to Parliament during the, course of the following week.   v   &apos; &apos; &apos;&apos;
Wax Pensions. ,2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePensions AppealLprd President of the Council (W.p. (43) 298) on two\pointsTribunals Bill, regarding the scope of the appeals for which provision was to be(Previous made in the Pensions Appeal Tribunals Bill how before Parliameht^Reference: The Bill conferred a right of appeal to a Tribunal against aW:M. (42) 55th refusal by the Minister of Pensions to award a pension, and againstConclusions,    a final assessment of the amount of a pension. It did not, however,Minute 4.)      confer any right of appeal against interim awards made before thefinal assessment. /J\ ,The War.Cabinet were informed that in the further discussions&apos;   . on the Bill there would be pressure for a right of appeal against theamount of these interim awards. Parliament would agree that finalassessment should not be made until the man&apos;s condition had becomestabilised; but in some cases it might be several years before thisstage was reached, and it would be urged that there should be a rightto appeal against temporary awards which might govern a man&apos;income for a substantial period.The main objection to this proposed extension of the right ofappeal was that, before final assessment, cases were subject toconstant review by the Ministry of Pensions; and, if each of theseinterim decisions were made subject to appeal, a considerable amountof additional work would be thrown on both the Ministry and the tribunals, and there was some risk that the machine might beoverloaded. -; . . The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that, if the period before final assessment was to be substantial, it would be difficultto resist the claim that there should be some right of appeal againstinterim awards. The case might perhaps be met by providing that,where a final assessment&apos;had not been made within a period of twoOr three years from the date of the injury, there should be an appealtoja Tribunal in respect of the amount of the current interim award.- The second question raised in the Memorandum by the lord president of the Council was whether there should be any right ofappeal to a Tribunal against the discretionary decisions of theMinister of Pensions.&apos; The view, of the Lord Presidents Committee on this point was,that decisions taken by the Minister in the exercise of a discretionought not to be made the subject of appeal. If it were desired tobring within the jurisdiction of the Appeal Tribunals matters inregard to which the Minister was at present empowered to exercise a discretion, it would be necessary to deprive the Minister of his existing discretion and to have these matters determined by preciserules which would be binding oh both the Minister , and the tribunals. &apos;A list of the matters in regard to which the minister had at present a measure of discretion was given in the Appendix tothe Memorandum.The &quot;view of the War Cabinet was that, where the Minister&apos;decision was discretionary, it could not properly be made the subjectof appeal to a Tribunal.  It was, however, desirable that the typesi of case in which the Minister now exercised a discretion should be examined, with a view to seeing whether it would be possible, insome &quot;of these cases, to separate the judicial element in the decision from the elements which were essentially matters for discretionarydecision. Where there was a separable element which was judicialin character, it might be desirable to provide that there should bea right of appeal to a Tribunal in respect &quot;of that part of theMinisters decision.It was pointed out that, if amendments were to.be put forward by the Government on these points, it was desirable that notice ofthe amendments should appear on the Order Paper at an early date.The War Cabinet- *Invited the Minister of Pensions, in consultation with the attorney-General, to consider these points further in thelight of the discussion and to report to the War Cabinetwhether any amendment of the Bill was desirable.
f^^^1^ 3. . The attention of the War jDabinetwas drawn tothe fact-PpSpsiu?a of: that during, the last few days there had been several instances ofInformation, premature disclosure in the Press of matters under discussion, or(Previous       about to be&apos; discussed, by the War Cabinet, &apos;Beferenee: The Daily Mail had published on the 3rd July an article aboutW.M. (42) 42nd the Governments study of demobilisation problem?, which, in theConclusions,    opinion of the Minister of Labour and National Service,. could notMinute 2.)      have been written without knowledge of the contents of a memo-randum which he had recently circulated to the War&quot;Cabinet. Therehad been similar disclosures of the details of impending proposals regarding War Pensions and Educational Reform.&apos;   And in the&apos;   Evening News on the 7th July there had been an article involvingpartial disclosure of the proceedings of the Committee on theReduction of National Government Staffs.The War Cabinet took a serious view of these disclosures, someof which appeared to have been made by some person or personswho had access to documents circulated for the information of the. War Cabinet or its Committees.Reference was made to the note on this subject which the PrimeMinister had circulated to Ministers on the 14th April, 1942. ItWas felt that a note in similar terms, strengthened and brought up to date by reference to these recent disclosures, should be issued to Ministers. It was also thought that a searching inquiry shouldbe held, with a view to tracing the source of the recent leakages.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Prime Minister to issue a further note to ministers, emphasising the need for taking everypracticable precaution to prevent unauthoriseddisclosures of this kind.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, theLord Privy Seal and the Attorney-General to hold animmediate inquiry into the recent cases of leakage, towhich reference had been made in the course of thediscussion.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,8th July, 1943.
