HO circulation.m;(48) 104th COKCLUSIOHS. MTrwrnna q.(27th, July? 1943 - 12.15 p.ra.)THE PRIME MINISTER reminded his colleagues of what he had said on this matter in 1937 (vide extract fromhis speech on the 30th May, 1927, circulated as W.P. (43)282).THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE,referring to a statement on page 1 of W.P.(43)282, saidthat too much weight should not be attached to the argu-ment that Civil Servants, being in permanent andpensionable employment, were in a special position.Municipal employees were also in permanent pensionablepositions, but in law they were free to affiliate if they wanted to do so.     He thought that the present difficulty had arisen largely from the way in which this matter hadbeen handled in 1939, when an answer had been given byMr. Chamberlain which had caused a good deal of resentmentAs a result of the discussions which had taken placesinee the present Government had been formed, the points at issue in regard to the Trade. Disputes and TradesUnion Act as a whole had now been narrowed down to thisrelatively small issue of affiliation.     The impression in Trade Union circles was that the Government as a whole were not indisposed to make a change, but that the ToryParty was putting obstacles in the way.On the other hand, it was urged that this was a very controversial matter which had been raised by the Labour iParty, and an already difficult position had been made faxmore acute by the action taken by the Union of Post QBEDi&quot;Workers in passing a resolution at their Annual Conferencapplying for affiliation to the T.U.C, It was also pointed out that legislation on this subject would be

difficult to reconcile with the undertaking that contro-versial legislation should be avoidsdoThe War Cabinet were informed that the PrimeMinister had undertaken to receive a Deputation from three Civil Service Unions, namely, the Post office engineering Union, the Inland Revenue Staff Federation,and the Civil Service Clerical Association.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would, of course,infox^m his colleagues of the line which he proposed totake, before seeing the Deputation.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICEsuggested that the best course might be that the PrimeMinister should inform the Deputation that the Govern-raent were not opposed to this matter being reopened andre-discussed provided that the threat to flout the lawwas first withdrawn.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, on merits, he had not changed his views from those which he held when the Acthad been passed in 1927*     If any amendment of Act wasto be put forward, his support of it would be on theground that such action would go a long way to removea erase of resentment and would encourage harmonious co-operation of the Trade Unions in the war effort.No decision was reached, and the   WarCabinet agreed to resume the discussion at an early date.:y.&apos;.y^y^V::&apos;&apos;&apos;^0yiOff ices of the War Cafe28TH &apos;
