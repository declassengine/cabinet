(43) 109thConclusions, .Minute 1.)Air Operations.home Theatre.Mediterranean.Ploesti.^Pacific.naval operations.Gibraltar.Pacific. rMilitary -Operations.Sicily.Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal.events of theprevious, week. ^Bomber Command had made two attacks during the previousweek, one on Hamburg and the other on Milan, Turin and Genoa.15,000 tons of bombs had now been dropped on Hamburg, and it hadbeen estimated that at least 320,000 persons had been renderedpermanently homeless. Coastal Command had carried out threepromising attacks on U-boats and off Texel had sunk a 4,00Ct-5,O00-ton merchant ship and a number of smaller vessels. Enemy losses had been 8 destroyed, 4 probably destroyed and 7 damaged. Britishlosses had been 37 bombers, 11 fighters and 6 Coastal command aircraft.Air activity had increased in support of the battle in Sicily.Naples had been bombed on three occasions.Exact details of the attack by United States Liberators onPloesti were not yet available, but it was believed that .severe damage had been done to four out of the six oil refineries attacked.Enemy losses in the Pacific had been reported as 46 destroyed,1 probably destroyed and 4 damaged. Allied losses amounted to aircraft.Shipping losses by enemy action during the previous week(including belated reports and Sicilian losses) amounted to33,034 tons. The number of U-boat sinkings continued to be satisfactory.Three merchant ships had been damaged by under-waterexplosions in Gibraltar Bay.United States forces claimed to have sunk one Japanese cruiser and 2 T.B.Ds. in the Solomons area.Axis forces continued to withdraw, and their resistance wasbeing affected by lack of reserves. It was thought that the enemy would shorten his line still further before making a final stand. Sofar, there had been no attempt at general evacuation to the Italianmainland. Allied troops were reported to be in good heart.Prisoners now amounted to 120,000, mostly Italians.The news from Russia continued to be satisfactory. In the Orelsector, where the Germans were resisting stubbornly, the russians were now some 14 miles west of the town. The importance of this advance to the Russians was that it gave them lateral railwaycommunication between Kursk and Moscow. In the Donetz sector the advance continued and Kharkov was now seriously threatened.. The War Cabinet^-Took note of these statements.Italy.(previous reference:W.M.(43) 109thConclusions,Minute 4.)&quot;2. The Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs wishedto consult the War Cabinet about the policy which he thought shouldbe pursued in regard to Italy during the next few days, pending further developments.Looking at the matter from the political point of view (andsubject, of course, to military considerations),&quot; the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs favoured the continuance of heavy air attacks on North Italy.As regards propaganda, he thought that we should neitherattack nor support the King of Italy and Field-Marshal Badoglio,but should keep on hammering at the point that the present ItalianGovernment had said that the war continued, that from the Allies&apos;point of view the war was therefore continuing, and that the ItalianGovernment was responsible for this state of affairs. Our militarysuccesses in Sicily and those of our Russian allies might also befeatured, and emphasis laid on the difficulties of the Italian troops; in the Balkans. No appeals or threats should be made to the Italian[25908] b 2
Government or people, but we should stand by our demand, forunconditional surrender.The War Cabinet-        . ; ^ vTook note, with approval, of this statement.SMpptog. 3.   The War Cabinet considered a Report.by the ShippingNitrates for Committee (W.P. (43) 346) regarding the supply of nitrates to egypt. Egypt.It was stated in: the Memorandum that, fOr lack of fertilisers,there had been an increasing drop in the yield of wheat per acre inEgypt. According to the estimates of the Middle East SupplyCentre, deliveries of at least 200,000 tons of nitrate should be madeto Egypt in 1944 if the country were to be self-sufficient in 1945;and, if an additional 100,000 tons could be supplied, there would:be a surplus in 1944-45 of about 250,000 tons of cereals which wouldbe available for the Forces and for export. It was pointed out that,&apos;for every ton of nitrate shipped above the amount sufficient for egypt&apos;s own requirements, between 2^ and 3 tons of cereals should eventually become available for our use in the Middle East. The -Shipping Committee therefore recommended that a total of300,000 tons of nitrate should be shipped to Egypt during the periodSeptember 1943 to October 1944, in accordance with a programme set out in paragraph 7 of their Report, on the understanding thata firm agreement was made with the Egyptian Government- requiring them to make available for our use a stated part of theirsurplus production of cereals, rice and sugar.General agreement was expressed with the Shipping Com-mittee&apos;s proposal. It was pointed out, however, in discussion, thatthis proposal involved the.use of a substantial amount of shipping space, and it was important that we should secure an adequatereturn. It would not be enough to obtain general assurances that production surplus to Egypt&apos;s need would be made available to us.Could we not stipulate that the fertilisers would be supplied only inreturn for stated amounts of produce?       .     ;The War Cabinet were informed that it would be difficult todetermine detailed conditions in London. It was, however, proposedin the Report that a definite agreement should be negotiated in cairo, and, if the Egyptian Government failed to honour that. agreement, further deliveries of fertilisers could be suspended. Allshipments would be the property of the U.K.C.C. up to the time oftheir arrival in Egypt, and could be withheld or diverted at the discretion of His Majesty&apos;s Government.It was the view of the War Cabinet that the agreement to be negotiated in Cairo should stipulate with the utmost possibleprecision the quantity, and price, of produce to be made availablefor our use in return for these shipments of fertilisers, and should reserve to the British Government discretion to suspend deliveries of fertilisers at any time.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Ministers of Supply and of War transport should be authorised to make arrangements for thesupply and shipment of 300,000 tons of nitrate to Egypt ** on the lines proposed in W.P. (43) 346.. * (2) Invited the Minister of War Transport to arrange, inconsultation with the Minister of. Food and other ministers concerned, for the conclusion of a detailedagreement with the Egyptian Government which wouldgive effect to the views of the War Cabinet as recordedabove.
219 W.M. 113 (43).Trade Disputes 4. At their Meeting on the 4th August the War Cabinet hadand Trade invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theUnions Act, Chancellor of the Exchequer to settle the terms of an agreed1927. communique regarding the deputation which the Prime Minister(Previous had received from three Civil Service Unions. The War CabinetKeferenee: had agreed that, if the representatives of the Unions were willing,W.M. (43) lilth this should include a statement of the consequences which would conclusions, ensue if the application now pending for affiliation to the T.U.C.Minute 3.) was proceeded with; but that, in default of agreement, this matter should be dealt with in a separate Government statement.The War Cabinet were informed that the representatives ofthe Unions had not been willing that the communique regardingthe deputation should include this warning of the consequences which would follow if a Civil Service Union became affiliated withthe T.U.C. The communique issued had therefore been confined to an announcement that the deputation had been received.Statements had now been &quot;published in certain newspapers tothe effect that the Government were considering some compromise solution. It was desirable that these statements should be contra-dieted without delay, since they were likely to arouse false hopesin certain quarters and to exacerbate feeling in others.. After a discussion,. of which a record is contained in theSecretary^ Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions,The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Information to inform the press at once that there was no foundation for the statementspublished in certain newspapers to the effect that theGovernment were considering a compromise with regardto the Trade Disputes Act.(2) Approved the terms of a Government announcementregarding the consequences which would follow theaffiliation of a Civil Service Union to the T.U.C.; and agreed that, subject to the concurrence of the Ministerof Labour and National Service and the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security, whose views should be ascertained, this announcement should be made without,further delay.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,9th August, 1943.
