Man-Power. 1.   At their meeting on the 16th August the War Cabinet had(Previous        invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultation with the reference:       Ministers of Production, Labour and National Service, and AircraftW.M. (43) 115th Production, to consider and report on certain difficulties which were conclusions,      likely to arise if an absolute and overriding preference Were givenMinute 7).       to the labour demands of the Ministry of Aircraft Production..-.v:-   The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord President of the Council (W.P. (43) 373) submitting thefollowing recommendations which had been agreed with theMinisters concerned :  /(a) Production which, though under the auspices of otherSupply Departments, was part of the aircraft pro-; gramme should be given the same preference for purposesof labour supply as aircraft, production itself.(6) As regards other supply programmes, the Minister ofProduction would from time to time designate otherurgent products or. services which were vital to our war: production and should be given priority equal to thatof the aircraft programme. The particular firms and,where necessary, the particular parts of the productionof those firms to which special preference should be accorded would then be identified and arrangementsmade through the normal machinery of the PreferencesSub-Committee of the Labour Co-ordinating Committeeto secure that this production received, where necessary,for purposes of labour supply equal preference with aircraft production.It was explained in the Memorandum that these arrangements would not involve any change in the statistical distribution of man-power supply, as settled by the War Cabinet on the 22nd July, orin the objectives of man-power policy then defined. They would,however, necessitate some modification of the absolute obligationnow resting on the Minister of Labour and National Service toensure that, whatever else happened, the labour force on aircraft production was increased by 115,000 by the end of 1943. It wastherefore proposed that the War Cabinet&apos;s Conclusions of the22nd July should be modified to the extent specified in paragraph 7of the Memorandum.: . The Minister of Production asked for an assurance that wherea particular product or service had been designated as contemplated by paragraph 3 of the Memorandum, and the firms concerned hadbeen identified, the normal machinery of the Preferences Sub-Committee would ensure that in respect of the production sodesignated the firm would receive, where necessary for purposes oflabour supply, equal preference with aircraft production.The Minister of Labour and National Service gave this assurance. As regards machinery, he would prefer that, when the firms had been identified, the particulars should be communicatedto his Department at Headquarters, so that the instructions issued to the local officers concerned could be in terms of specific firms and production. This would obviate the necessity of issuing generalinstructions affecting categories of work, which would then have tobe interpreted by local officers.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the procedure recommended in paragraphs 2-6/.&quot;&apos; of W.P. (43) 373.(2) Agreed that the first sentence in paragraph (14) of the WarCabinet&apos;s Conclusions of the 22nd July should be modified so as to read : -&quot; In the administrative arrangements made to giveeffect to this redistribution Of man-power every endeavour should be made to avoid a situation in which,if the supply up to the end of 1943 proved insufficient
Canada. 2.   The Lord President of the Councilgave the War Cabinet.  , an account of the proceedings at the meeting of the War Committeen   A: of the Canadian Government which he and the Prime Minister hadDtoSns      attended at Quebec on the 10th August.at Quebec. The discussion on civil aviation is recorded in Minute 3 below.The remainder of the. Lord Presidents statement, and the discussion which followed, has been recorded separately.Civil Aviation. 3.   The Lord President of the Council said that civil aviation(Previous        had been among the matters raised at the meeting of the WarReference:       Committee of the Canadian Cabinet which he and the PrimeW.M. (43) 102nd Minister had attended in Quebec.  In the course of discussion, theConclusions,      Canadian Ministers had explained that their objections to a minute 2).       preliminary discussion (before the proposed International Con-ference took place) between representatives of the United KingdomGovernment and the Dominions had been based on the probablereactions to this procedure not of the United States Government,but of powerful interests in the United States.   The Canadian ministers thought that if such a preliminary conference were heldthese interests would get busy, and would bring such influence tobear on the American Government as to make that Governmentunwilling to enter into as favourable an agreement as we shouldotherwise be able to reach.The Lord President of the Council said that this point had beena new one to the Prime Minister and himself, and the Prime minister had said that he would consider it. The Canadian Ministers had agreed that it would be a good plan if the Prime Minister were toraise the question of civil aviation informally with the President, inorder to clarify the position.The Lord President of the Council added that he had alsoformed the impression that certain circles in Canada would be relieved if we were to take the same step as they had done andremove.civil aviation from a Service Department to the ambit of anew Civil Department.Lord Halifax said that, when Lord Knollys had visitedWashington before returning to this country to become Chairman ofthe B.O.A.C., he had arranged a meeting at which Lord Knollyscould meet members of the United States Administration concernedwith civil aviation, and also the heads of some of the principalUnited States air lines. He thought that one of the impressionswhich Lord Knollys had derived from this meeting had been thatthe Americans recognised the immense strength of the British worldposition in regard to civil aviation, having regard to the dispersionof our Empire and to the number of bases which we possessed.The Lord Privy Seal said that a meeting of the ministerial committee on Civil Aviation had taken place that afternoon, atwhich Ministers had expressed considerable anxiety as to theposition. No reply had yet been received to the letter which theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs had sent to Mr. VincentMassey nearly a month ago asking the Canadian Government toparticipate,. before the proposed International Conference, in prior meeting in London of Commonwealth and Indian representa-tives at the High Commissioner level. Until this reply wasreceived it was impossible for us to approach the other Dominions..Time was now getting short. If there was further delay, it wouldbe difficult to arrange the Conference as far in advance of the presidential Election as was desirable.   Furthermore, as soon asto meet all the requirements set out in (13) above, the deficit would fall on the Ministry of Aircraft Pro-duction.&quot;
Parliament met again there would be debates in both Houses and unless further progress had been made, the Government spokesmenwould be in a position of great difficulty. .....The Lord Privy Seal said that the Ministerial Committee had therefore recommended that a telegram should be sent to the PrimeMinister asking him whether there had been any definite upshot tohis talks on civil aviation, and asking him to urge upon theCanadian Government the importance of communicating to us animmediate decision on the proposals in regard to procedure whichhad been made to them in the letter from the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.The War Cabinet-Approved this suggestion and asked the Deputy PrimeMinister to send a telegram to the Prime Minister on the- lines proposed by the Lord Privy Seal.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,19th August, 1943.
