Italian 1;  The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the prisoners of Lord President of the Council about Italian prisoners of war war. (W.P. (43) 392).(Previous There were already 74,900 Italian prisoners at work in thisEeference: country, and arrangements had been made to bring a substantialW.M. (43) 127th further number before the end of 1943. The main question at issueConclusions,     was whether these arrangements should stand.minute 4.) jn^e Minister of War Transport informed the War Cabinetthat arrangements were inhand to bring another 8,000 prisoners tothis country, starting almost immediately. Thereafter, however,there would be no facilities to bring further prisoners to this countryuntil 1944.The War Cabinet also had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (43) 395) containing the text ofan aide-memoire which it was suggested should be issued for the guidance of Gommandants in charge of camps of Italian prisonersof war in this country.The first point raised in discussion was whether general eisenhower&apos;s broadcast to the Italian people, made on the 29th Julylast, put us under any obligation not to bring any further prisoners to this country. In this broadcast General Eisenhower had saidthat, provided all British and Allied prisoners then in Italian handswere safely restored to us and not taken away to Germany, thehundreds and thousands of Italian prisoners captured by us in tunisia and Sicily would return to the countless Italian homes wholonged for them.It was clear that the conditions set out in the broadcast had notbeen fulfilled, and it was generally felt, therefore, that the broadcastdid not impose on us any obligation not to bring further prisoners to this country.The question was, however, raised whether this position hadbeen affected by anything contained in the negotiations leading up&apos; to the signature by Italy of the armistice.The War Cabinet were reminded that the Armistice Termssigned by the Italian representative contained the followingclause : &quot; All prisoners or internees of the United Nations to be immediately turned over to the Allied Commander-in-Chief,and none of these may now or at any time be evacuated toGermany.&quot;The question was raised whether supplementary instructions had not been issued to the effect that the Italian Government should,if necessary, order the immediate release of all United Nationsprisoners in danger of capture by the Germans.The War Cabinet agreed that the course of the negotiations onthis matter should be looked up.* The general view of the WarCabinet was, however, that these discussions about the steps whichthe Italian Government could take in order to ensure fulfilment ofthe Armistice Terms were not strictly relevant to the fulfilment ofthe conditions contained in General Eisenhower&apos;s broadcast of the29th July.* The supplementary instructions issued to our representative at the Lisbondiscussions contained the following : &quot; The Italian Government must, at the hour of the Armistice, order that allUnited Nations prisoners in danger of capture by the Germans shall be immediately released.&quot;The record of the discussions in Lisbon states that :  &quot; General Smith read aloud, paragraph by paragraph, the Armistice con-ditions and the various comments which he was authorised to makewith regard thereto.&quot;The record also states that with regard to Clause 3 (dealing with prisoners)General Castellano said that there might be practical limitations to what theItalians could accomplish in preventing the movement of Allied prisoners ofwar to Germany. The Italians would, however, make every effort to complywith this condition.     *
Parliament. 2.   The War Cabinet approved the following arrangements for business of the Government Spokesmen in the Man-Power Debate in the ensuingthe House.       week : (Previous ^ The Minister of Labour and National Service would openEeference: Debate on the first day with a statement lastingW.M. (43) 127th thirty to forty minutes.Conclusions, ^) If there had been any serious attack on the waste ofMmute 11.) man-power in the Civil Service, the Chancellor of theExchequer would close the first day&apos;s Debate. otherwise there should not be a closing speech from the Governmenton the first day.(3) The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour(Mr. McCorquodale) would open on the second day, andthe Minister would wind up for the Government on thesecond dav.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,17th September, 1943.The War Cabinet was also informed that there was evidencethat a limited number of our prisoners had been.sent to Germanyafter the 29th July, including certain Naval prisoners who had been captured by the Italians and not by the Germans.The second point raised was whether, in. selecting prisoners tocome to this country, we should avoid Sicilians and those from partsof Southern Italy likely to be occupied in the near future.The view taken on this was that, while we were not under any obligation not to bring Sicilians to this country, it would be better,so far as possible, to bring Italians whose homes were in northern italy.The third point discussed was the proposal that guidance shouldbe given to Commandants in charge of prisoner-of-war camps inthis country.The War Cabinet were informed that there was no evidence ofany unruliness in these camps, or of any disinclination to work onthe part of the prisoners. It was generally felt that it was undesirable to run the risk of raising controversial issues by givingguidance in the form of a statement which might become public.The War Cabinet reached the following Conclusions : (1) The arrangements in hand to bring a further 8,000 italian prisoners to this country in the immediate future should proceed.(2) In selecting the prisoners to be included in this batch, an endeavour should be made, so far as possible, to avoidincluding Sicilians.(3) The question whether further batches of Italian prisonersshould be brought to this country in 1944 was reservedfor later consideration.(4) The Secretary of State for War was authorised to circulateprivate guidance to Commandants in charge of italian prisoners of war on the lines of the aide-memoire set outin paragraph 2 of his Memorandum, but omitting the lasttwo sentences. The aide-memoire should not, however,be used in such a way as would lead to its being made public.(5) The Minister of Labour and National Service was asked toexamine, in consultation with the Service departments and other Departments concerned, the question whetherPioneer or Labour Units of Italians should be formed for employment overseas.
