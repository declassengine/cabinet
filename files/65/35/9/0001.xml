-Jfeaoae. 1.   The War Cabinet discussed recent developments in theGeneral de attitude of the United States authorities towards the FrenchGaulle and     Committee of National Liberation. rGeneral Giraud.      Telegrams from Washington suggested that the statements(Previous      which had recently been allowed to leak out in the American: PressReference:      were part of a campaign to break up the Committee of NationalW.M (43) 87th Liberation and to get rid of General de Gaulle. It was unfortupateConclusions     that these public statements should be made at a time, when the.Minute 4 )&apos;    position and authority of the Committee were-increasing, and the civilian elements on the Committee were becoming more influential.There was a risk that the course of action taken by the UnitedStates Administration might have the result of strengtheningde Gaulle&apos;s position at the expense of the Committee.. The United States authorities appeared to have, made publicuse of some parts of a, confidential document on British policy towards General de Gaulle, which the Prime Minister had prepared in June for the guidance of the British Press. This document hadbeen sent to the United States authorities for their confidential information only,, and public use should not have been made of it without our consent. The Prime Minister said that he would consider whether he could usefully send a personal message : to president Roosevelt about the disclosure of parts of this document and also on the general question of the United States attitudetowards the french Committee.Meanwhile, the War Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should take an early opportunity of speaking. to the American Ambassador in London on the general issues which arose and, in particular, on the probable attitude of the UnitedStates Government towards the proposal that a limited degree of recognition might now be given to the French Committee.Middle East. 2. . The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theBritish Policy. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (48) 301) and theMinister of State (W.P. (43) 302);In his Memorandum the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs;    .. drew attention to indications, that the Americans were taking an increasing interest in the countries of the Middle East, and to thedifficulties which had arisen in our relations with the United states as a result of this and in the absence of a clear definition of british policy. To meet this situation the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs proposed that a Memorandum setting forth our generalpolicy (on the lines of the draft annexed to his Memorandum) shouldbe communicated to the United States Government with a view toaligning our ideas with theirs and reaching general agreement on policy.The Minister of State, in his Memorandum, welcomed theproposals of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and expressed the hope that in any expose of our policy in the middle east to the Americans, prominence would be given to its economic aspects, dealt with in certain Resolutions of the Middle EasternWar Council annexed to his Memorandum. In particular, theMinister hoped that the War Cabinet would (a) endorse the programme of development by stages towards a Middle East Economic Council, and approve its incor-poration as one of bur objectives in our communication to the Americans;(fe) authorise him, on his return to the Middle East, to keepAmerican representatives in that area fully in touchwith the development of our policy; and to begin to workOUt in practice, in concert with the other authorities concerned, the development recommended under (a).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that his memorandum had been submitted largely at the suggestion of theMinister of State, who thought that ,it would be very helpful to
153W.M.M (43).British Authorities in the Middle East/if a&apos; Memorandum coiold.becommunicated to the United States Government setting out our general policy in the Middle East.The Minister of State said that the United States authorities had no definite policy in the Middle East. Their actions in this area often seemed to be prompted by some suspicion of our position,or even by a spirit of opposition to Our interests, and this resultedin minor irritations. He thought that we ought to ; invite the americans frankly to recognise that the British Commonwealth and empire had a predominant interest in the Middle East, and thatthe American interest in this area was relatively minor and subsidiary. Unless we took this step and could ensure co-operationwith the Americans, there was a risk that they would go their own way and set up their own organisations in competition with ourown throughout the Middle East. Action on the lines of theMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs would,he thought, be most helpful m this direction. The only commentwhich he wished to offer was that perhaps he. would prefer a document which was even franker and more outspoken as to our policy, and as to the recognition of our predominant position in theMiddle East.The Minister of State said that his second point was that theprojection into the post-war period of British interest and guidancethroughout the countries of the Middle East could, he thought, onlycome through economic matters. The Middle East Supply Centrealready had its ramifications throughout the countries in the middle east. He would like to see the Supply Centre, which had been setup to serve war needs, developed by degrees into a Middle EastEconomic Council, which might continue after the war. A plan hadbeen drawn up by which we could move in this direction somewhatcautiously, by progressive stages. He would, of course, reportprogress at intervals to the War Cabinet, and would seek their authority before taking any major step. Besides the acute shortagesresulting from the existing situation, there was a dangerousinflationary movement in the Middle East, and he was satisfied thatthe Governments of the Middle East countries could not deal withthe situation and could not get back on to an even keel after the warwithout our help.The Minister of Production said that he was in favour of actionon the lines proposed, as a short-term policy. He thought, however,that when competition in exports started again it might be verydifficult to maintain in existence a body on the lines of the proposedMiddle East Economic Council. This issue, however, would notarise for some years.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that it wouldbe necessary to consult the Dominions before any approach was madeto the United States Government on the lines suggested. He alsoquestioned whether the communication Of a long Memorandum onthe lines of the Annex to the Memorandum by the Secretary of StatefOr Foreign Affairs was the best way of handling the matter. Hethought it would be better to deal with the matter on a high level,and orally, at any rate in the first instance.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs expressed generalagreement with this view, and said that the Annex appended to his memorandum could be treated as: an aide-memoire for use by our ambassador if the matter was dealt with in Washington.The Secretary of State for India thought that the matter would best be handled on broad lines, emphasising that the Middle Eastwasa factor of vital importance to us. .V      The Secretary of State for A   pointed out that civil aviationwas referred to in paragraph 9 of the Memorandum by the SecretaryOf State for Foreign Affairs. He asked for an assurance that this[25765-2] b 2
-^as-not jincluded in the matters to be, dealt, with by the Middle^E^t*  Economic Coundil. This was agreed to.&apos;    Reference was made to paragraph 12 of the Annex to theMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, dealing. with Palestine. It was suggested that, if the Memorandum was to&apos; be used in its present&apos; form,: the&apos; words- &quot; neighbouring - arab countries&quot; should be substituted for &quot;other Arab countries&quot; in&apos;&apos;/.&apos;.;&apos;.&apos;&apos;&quot;.;&apos;&apos;      line 7. &apos;-&apos;      :vV&apos; &apos;r ^      &apos;QU Questions. Some further discussion ensued as to oil interests in the middle east. The Minister of State alluded to the prospecting which was: going on by United States interests in the Middle East, and saidthat he had reason to believe that our oil interests might welcomea frank aproach to the American interests, telling them where&apos; ourvital interests lay, and making it clear that we were not opposed- to the Americans acquiring oil interests in the Middle East providedthat they were not inconsistent with our vital interests in this area.- The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe thought that infiltration by American oil interests might embitterbur relations with the United States in the Middle East, and that itmight be for consideration whether an approach should be made tothe President on this matter.The Prime Minister thought that there was no good reason for raising the far-reaching issues involved by those oil questions atthe present time, and doubted if it was in our interests to do so.The Minister of State said that his main proposals wereunaffected by the suggestion which he had made in regard to oilquestions.- The War Cabinet asked that, in the light of the discussion, aseries of recommendations should be drawn up and submitted bythe Secretary of State.for Foreign Affairs for their consideration at a Meeting in the near future.Note.-These recommendations are contained in W.P. (43) 312,which were submitted to, and approved by, the War Cabinet at their meeting on Monday, the 19th July, 1943 (W.M. (43) 101st Con-elusions, Minute 7), subject to one amendment.The recommendations as thus approved read as follows: (1) It is approved in principle that the Middle East SupplyCentre should be developed by stages towards a middle east Economic Council, which would include representa-tives not only of the British and United States&apos; Governments, but also of the Governments of the mainterritories in the Middle East. This development, whichshould allow room for the association, as desired of anyother Governments with special interests in the MiddleY     ; East area^ should be carried out cautiously.   TheMinister of State would report progress periodically,, and should seek the approval of the War Cabinet before taking any step which might have important effects inthe political or economic sphere. In particular, hewould, of course, ask for authority before any steps are taken leading to the formal establishment of a middle east Economic Council.(2) An endeavour should be made to reach an understanding with i the United States Government as to our generalpolicy in the Middle East. , for this purpose a communication should be madeto the United States Government to the effect that, while&apos; the Middle East is an area of essential strategic import-- ance to the British Commonwealth and Empire, we nopethat the United States Government will be willing to collaborate with us in this area, and that for- thispurpose a mutual understanding of each other&apos;s aimsa^
155W.M. 89 (43).(3) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs would considerthe best way in which this matter could be taken up withthe United States Government. At this stage, the cbm-munication of a written memorandum to the UnitedStates Government was unlikely to be the best method of approach, but a memorandum might perhaps be sent toHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington as a basis onwhich he might initiate conversations with the President0r the Secretary of State.(4) It might be indicated to the United States Government&apos; that we hoped that the Middle East Supply Centre mightgradually assume the functions of a Middle EastEconomic Council, and that we might have their con-tinued co-operation and collaboration on this body.Air Policy. 3.   The War Cabinet had a short discussion about the bombing(Previous of targets in Italy.
