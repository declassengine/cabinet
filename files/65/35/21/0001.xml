WiM. Ill (43);Indian (JrainRequirements.(previous reference;WfM.(43)39thConclusions^)cabinet had before them-(i) A Report by the Shipping Committee on Indians Require-ments of Food Grains (W.P. (43) 345).(ii) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India(W.P. (43) 349) on the same subject.The Shipping Committee, in their Report, stated that a requesthad been received from the Government of India for 500,000 tonsof wheat to be imported from September 1943 to February 1944inclusive. The Report summarised the particulars given by theGovernment of India in support of this request, together with anestimate of the results which they anticipated would follow a food shortage.After analysing the means of meeting the shortage, theCommittee pointed out that---(i) Out of a maximum of-30,000 tons a month which could be lifted from/Australia, some margin might be availablefor India after meeting whatever requirements forCeylon and the Middle East might be judged necessary,(ii) Barley from Iraq up to 100,000 tons might be shippedagainst the Indian demand. Less than one-third,however, of the Indian demand could be met inthese, ways.The Secretary of State for India said that the Indian econbmywas being strained almost to breaking-point by the enormousdemands made upon it as a source of supplies and men for the Army,and as a base for military operations. In January last a serious shortage had shown itself, and a request had been made for food grains to be imported into India. Later, however, the harvest had proved better than anticipated, and it had been found possible to discontinue the import of grain. The Viceroy, however, had alwayswarned him that a serious situation might arise.One of the inherent difficulties of the position was, of course,the extreme difficulty of extracting surpluses from small producers.It was true that the 500,000 tons asked for was only 1 per cent, ofIndia&apos;s total production. But considerably less thap half the total production came into the market, and the deficit must be judged inrelation to.the areas and sections of the community in which theshortage had or would show itself... There was no doubt that the present shortage of grain wasconnected with the inflationary position. Steps have been taken tomeet this and had already met with a definite measure of success,but it was clear that no further anti-inflationary measuresinstituted at this date could have any effect in extracting grainfrom the producers to meet the immediate situation.The Secretary of State for India urged the War Cabinet most strongly to treat this as a very serious situation which, unless it wasmet, would seriously impair Indians war effort.In the view of the War Cabinet, the shortage of grain in india was not the result of physical deficiency but of hoarding, due toinflationary conditions. There Was general agreement that thesituation could not be dealt with simply by the importation of grainand that it must be attacked by a number of different methods.Thus-(a) Adequate steps must be taken, by good propaganda inIndia and by effective advertising of whatever supplieswe could manage to send, to induce, hoarders to releasegrain. It was most important to reverse the tendencywhich existed in one or two provinces for those inauthority to encourage peasants to hold on to their grain.(6) Increasing attention should be paid to measures to curbinflation. In piarticular, a,n endeavour should be madeto make more consumer goods available.    It was 25897-2]
appreciated that this might involve switching back tothe manufacture of consumer goods some of the.producttive capacity at present devoted to stores required forthe war effort.      -        . - : -(c) The Minister of War Transport reminded the War Cabinet^that in January 1943 a demand had been made for anadditional 600,000 tons of wheat, but in the result it&apos;hadnot -been necessary to ship anything approaching this quantity.   He expected that much the same would- happen on this occasion. If a shortage occurred, Ceylonwould feel the pinch first, and he therefore proposed thatthe first step should be to earmark sufficient grain fprg Ceylon&apos;s requirements. After the requirements of ceylon and the Middle East had been met, it would be extremely difficult to find further ships which could, be,,x,, sent to Australia to fetch grain. If, however, the WarCabinet decided that some action should be taken, hethought that arrangements should now be made to import not more than 50,000 tons as a token shipment.This should, however, hot be earmarked for India, but should be ordered to Colombo to await instructions there.He also thought that it might be possible, as stated bythe Shipping Committee, to make available up to100,000 tons of barley from Iraq.(d) The- Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs enquire whether,   if  export  of  wheat  from  the  southern dominions were to be greatly increased, it would not benecessary to send them additional fertilizers.   The*       Minister of War Transport confirmed that this was so.(e) The Secretary of State for India asked the War Cabinet- not to take a firm decision to limit the help which wouldbe afforded to India to the amount proposed by theMinister of War Transport.The general view of the War Cabinet was that no further action should be decided upon at the present time; but that it would,of course, be open to the Secretary of State for India to raise thematter again at a later date in the light of the circumstances then existing.The War Cabinet reached the following Conclusions :-(1) Approval was given.to action being taken on the lines proposed by the Minister of War Transport at &apos;&apos; X.f&apos;(2) The Secretary of State for India was asked to telegraph tothe Government of India urging the need for further action, on the lines suggested in discussion, to combatinflation and to induce producers to part with grainmore freely.(3) A Standing Committee on Indian Financial Questions wasappointed, comprising- The Chancellor of the Exchequer (in the Chair),-  The Minister of Production,The Secretary of State for India,The Secretary of- State for War,., The President of the Board of Trade,The Paymaster-General.The first task which the Committee should under-take would be to consider steps to combat inflation inIndia. This Enquiry should cover such questions, aswhether some part of India&apos;s capacity, now devoted towar production, should not be switched back to the; ; manufacture of consumer goods. v

The &quot;War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePrime Minister - (VVJ?. -.&quot;(43)- .327): summarising the main, issues involved in a series of Memoranda* w^ich had been circulated onthese subjects, and setting out provisional Conclusions.On the form of enquiry into demobilisation (paragraphs 6 and7 of the Prime Ministers Memorandum) the War Cabinet took theview that what was required at this stage was an enquiry of anon-technical nature into the issues involved, which were very far-reaching.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet- (1) Expressed general agreement with the provisional Con-clusions set out in the Prime Ministers Memorandum.(2) Decided that a Committee, consisting of The Minister without Portfolio (Chairman),.The   Financial    Secretary   to   the   Treasury(Mr. Assheton),The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofHome Security (Miss Ellen Wilkinson),The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofSupply (Mr. Duncan Sandys),The Parliamentary Secretary to the Board ofEducation (Mr. Chuter Ede),The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofWar Transport (Sir Arthur $alter),The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare (Mr. D. M. Foot),should be appointed to carry out a general survey of ourdemobilisation plans, on the basis of a two-stage ending of the war.The Minister of Production was asked to furnish the committee with such material as they might need for the purposes of theirEnquiry from the answers to the guestionnaire-which. he had put tothe Chiefs of Staff (see Annex to W.P. (43) 327).The Committee would, of course, call for such other informationas they might require from the Service Departments, the Ministryof Labour and National Service, and other Departments affected.(Previous;./  ...Reference:W.M.
