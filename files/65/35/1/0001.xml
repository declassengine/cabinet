It. was desirable that the full Report of the Conference should also bepuM;ished;as soea^Ss^acticable.?&apos;&apos;&apos; - /.-&apos;-.;. -v..(&amp;)-One of the important, ,-points which had emerged&apos; at the&quot;Conference was Ike prospect -ofvworfd shortages of,food after the&apos;war. -There would clearly be great difficulty in finding sufficient supplies.of food for the. relief of-Europe; - and it was important toavoid,raising hopes that relief would be provided on more liberalj.seaies than- would in fact-be-, practicable... % One of the main problems in the immediate,: future would betp persuade the United States toreadjust the balance of their agriculture and to increase their foodproduction.(c) In this connection we should take care that the ReliefOrganisations did Hot dome to occupy too dominant a position inrelation to world food supplies. There.was a real risk that this organisation might seek to assume functions which we should wishto see discharged through the machinery of the Combined Boards.In particular, it might be claimed that it was the duty of. a relieforganisation to control the supply of food to all countries whichwere not in a position to pay for it. by their exports.(d) The War Cabinet: were informed that the proceedings ofthe Food Conference were to be debated in the House of Lords on tuesday, the 6th July. It would be convenient if the announcementproposed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in his memorandum could be made at Question time that day in the Houseof Commons, so that the Government spokesman would be in aposition to make a similar announcement in the course of the debate in the-Mouse of Lords. &apos; -&apos;   The War Cabinet- .:..    \ . &apos; -(1) Authorised the Secretary Of State ior Foreign Affairs: to announce in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the-6th July, the Governments acceptance of the Resolu-,tions.pasjed by the Food.; Conference, in. the&apos;-termsindicated at the end of his Memorandum W.P. (48) .-275.(2) Invited the Lord Privy. Seal: to arrange for a similar state--     ment to be made on the same day in the House of Lords.j^is^:&quot;&quot;.W- ;(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet had:before them a.Joint Memorandum.By the Minister of Agriculture: and Fisheries and the Secretary of: State:;;for/Sobtlaiajill^^pl^^g &quot; &apos;*    &quot; &apos; &quot;   &apos;* &quot;foildwihg.Lterms: had ;been:.;placed ;on,-Of-Members.&apos;:&apos;-^:;-ier that a Motion in the[25681]-&quot;That in the opinion of the&apos;.

.-The, Ministers ^coneer&amp;ediasked/the -.-guidance of the^Bn^as^.^Mption,,aM^In discussion, it was pointed pui,thai(t the&apos; Motion, in some respects, went beyond the existing, Government undertakings as topostrwar agricultural policy. Several phrases contained in it were liable;to lead to misconception, or,.were open to criticism!. Generally,it was undesirable::that the. Government should add to their, post-war commitments except on the basis of very carefully framedstatements.The War Cabinet was also informed, that one reason why this motion had been-put down was that, under standing orders of theHouse/ matters which involved new legislation Could not bediscussed in Committee of Supply; and that difficulty was thereforeanticipated in ensuring ^discussion of post-war matters on SupplyDays. The War Cabinet,agreed that there should be opportunities for full and frank discussion and exchanges of views on post-war policy, without the need for reaching formal conclusions on a motion such as that now under consideration..The Joint Parliamentary Secretary-to the Treasury (Mr. Stuart)stated that it was understood that the authorities of the Househad under consideration a suggestion that some means should be devised to bring about some modification of the present arrange-ments, so as to enable post-war matters to be discussed on SupplyDays, Alternatively, it might be possible to do this by introducing a fixed form of Motion for use on these occasions. It was felt thatit was on these lines that a solution of the matter should be sought.The War Cabinet-: i Asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as leader of the House, to take up with the authorities of the house the suggestion that some amendment should be made in theexisting &quot;arrangements, so as to enable post-war matters tobe discussed on Supply Days.If a solution could not be found on these lines, the matter should again be brought before the War Cabinet, with aview to determining whether the Government should putdown a Motion of their own on post-war agricultural policy; but the Motion on the Order Paper (set out inparagraph 1 of W.P. (43) 280) should not be accepted.Policy.(previous reference:WM. (41) 28thConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of War Transport (W.P. (43) 285), setting out the line which it was proposed that the Government Spokesman should take in the forthcoming Debate in the House of Commons on post-war shipping policy.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Approved the line proposed in this Memorandum, and agreed that the Joint Parliamentary Secretaries- of theMinistry of War Transport should be the government spokesmen in the forthcoming Debate, Mr. Noel Bakerbeing the first Spokesman arid Sir Arthur Salter winding up on behalf of the Government ,-,Mait&amp;.        .      .;, 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theConstitution.     Secretaryof State for the Colonies (W.P.

The Secretary of State for Foreign&quot;Affairs s^id.a telegram.had been received from the,-Eesident-Minister at Algiers; reporting,that Ceneral-Criraud was proposing to visit the United:States. Thequestion had &quot;been raised Whether, as he might wish to return via the Northern Soute, he should be invited to pay a visit to this c anThe view of. the War Cabinet was that for General Giraud topay a visit to this country at this moment would he ah unnecessarycomplication in an already difficult situation. The War Cabinettherefore-Decided that the reply to be sent to Mr. Macmillan shouldbe that we strongly advised that General Giraud should return to Algiers from the United States via Gibraltar;and that, in our view, his proposed visit to North Americaat the present juncture was ill-timed.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,1st July, 1943.
