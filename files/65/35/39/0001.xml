The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of the.previous week.Bad weather had restricted the activities of Bomber Commandagainst Germany to Mosquito attacks on Berlin and the Ruhr andto an attempt to breach the Dortmund-Ems Canal, which, owing toweather conditions, failed. A heavy attack had been made on theMontlucon Rubber Tyre Factory. Two attacks had also been madeon railway communications between France and Italy. coastal command had attacked one U-boat. Our losses during the week had.been 13 bombers, 18 fighters and 4 Coastal Command aircraft.Enemy losses had been 20 aircraft destroyed, 4 probably destroyed and 11 damaged.United States aircraft had attacked the ports of Nantes andLa Pallice and airfields and factories in Northern France. Theyclaimed to have destroyed 45 enemy aircraft.During the previous week a record number of 11,000 sorties hadbeen flown, as against 1,000 by the enemy. Enemy losses claimedhad been 133 destroyed, 14 probably destroyed and 33 damaged, asagainst Allied losses of 23 aircraft. 6,000 tons of bombs had been dropped on enemy communications and battle targets in front of the fifth Army.In the Salamaua and Lae operations it was claimed that116 Japanese aircraft had been destroyed, as against 20 of theAllies.Shipping losses by enemy action during the previous week,including a hospital ship sunk in the Mediterranean operations,amounted to 14,000 tons. Losses from all causes for the week,amounted to 21.000 tons.The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that the circumstances in which this hospital ship had been sunk were being examined.Enemy submarines had. resumed their activity in the Atlantic.Two convoys had been attacked, but full details were not yet available.Warships of all types, including two battleships, had givensupporting fire in the Salerno operations.Italian warships so far surrendered included 5 battleships,8 cruisers, 8 destroyers. 1 T.B.D., 21 submarines, H T.Bs., I aircrafttransport and 9 merchant ships.The Prime Minister said that a decision as to the future of thesurrendered Italian warships should be reached as soon as possible.The War Cabinet-Asked the Chiefs of Staff to submit a report within thenext few- days, giving their views as to how these warshipscould best be employed.The Glider The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Admiralty, inPtocket Bomb.    consultation with other departments, had already started invent investigation-tions about the Glider Rocket Bomb which the Germans were nowusing in attacks against our warships.MilitaryOprrst::-s.Ifearr-The Prime Minister said thatimportance, and should be conductedThe War Cabinet were informedtinswithenquiry was. of greatrigour and despatch.ie course of the militaryoperations m Italy. On the 13th September the German attack atthe junction of the American and British forces in the Valley of theSele had succeeded in driving the Allies back to within 3 or*4 miles of the beaeaes. Later, following air and sea bombardment, and. the arrival of reinforcements, the situation had been restored and our forces were now advancing. Little opposition was being met withon the southern half of the Fifth Army front, but on the northernhalf of the front the Germans, were putting&apos; up stiff resistance, withthe eyident intention of denying Naples to us as long as possible.Light forces had landed on, and were now in occupation of, the islands o: Caste lorizo. 3&apos;amos, Leres and Cos.; 26120]si 2
Pacific. The Japanese forces retreating from Salamaua were being pursued by two Australian battalions. The Japanese retreat fromLae was also continuing.Russia. The Russians had made substantial progress in the Smolensksector and claimed to have opened the door.to Smolensk. They had also improved their positions beyond Briansk and towards Kiev.- In the South they had taken Novorossisk, and it seemed likely thatthe Germans were now withdrawing from the Taman peninsula.The most important advances during the week had, however, beenthose made in the direction of Kiev, where it seemed likely that theRussian forces would soon reach the line of the Dnieper.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.Rudolf Hess.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 121stConclusions,Minute 3.)- 2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that noticehad been given of various Parliamentary Questions asking forfurther information about Hess. In view of the partial disclosuresmade by the Minister of Information in the interview which he had given to the Press in North America, he thought that the best wayof dealing with these Questions would be to circulate in the official report a statement of the main facts relating to Hess. This couldbe based on the statement prepared some time ago by the Ministerof Aircraft Production for the purpose of a communication whichit had then been intended to make to the Soviet Government.The War Cabinet-    -Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toarrange for these Questions to be dealt with by a statement on these lines, the terms of which would be agreed with thePrime Minister.Prisoners ofWar.Exchange ofsick andwoundedprisoners.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 56thConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The War Cabinet were informed that it now seemed thatan agreement would shortly be concluded with the German Govern-ment for the reciprocal exchange of some 5,000 seriously woundedprisoners of war. It was expected that the actual exchange wouldtake place some time in the course of the next month. No public statement would, however, be made until the exchange had been effected.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.France.French naval vessels formerlyat Alexandria.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 79thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The War Cabinet were informed that certain French warships from the squadron formerly at Alexandria had arrivedat Dakar. Some of the crews had adopted an insolent attitudetowards General de Gaulle.The War Cabinet-Asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toencourage the French Committee of National Liberation, to take strong measures in regard to the crews of these ships.
Army.Minimum age for overseas service.(previous kef erence:W.M. (42) 157thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (43) 378) recommending that parliament should be asked to agree that the minimum age formilitary service overseas should be reduced from 19 to 18^ years.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that hewould be glad of an opportunity to discuss with the Secretary ofState for War the extent to which it might be possible to meet thesituation by other expedients.The War Cabinet-Deferred  consideration  of  this  Memorandum pending further consultation between the Minister of Labour and national Service and the Secretary of State for War.Italy.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 127thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The War Cabinet had under consideration two telegrams from Algiers (N.A.F. 409 from General Eisenhower, and 1812 fromthe Resident Minister at Algiers) about the position of the BadoglioGovernment.A decision was now necessary as to what our attitude shouldbe towards this Government. It was suggested in these telegramsthat, as Italy was now in a de facto state of war with Germany, weshould endeavour to take action which would strengthen its authority.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs circulated to theWar Cabinet a draft telegram to the Resident Minister at Algiers,setting out the action which could be taken with this end in view.The War Cabinet went through the draft paragraph by paragraph. A number of amendments were proposed, and suggestions made for modification of the terms of the draft.As regards procedure, it would, of course, be necessary to obtainthe assent of the United States Government before action was taken on the lines proposed in the draft telegram. The question was raised whether it would also be necessary to obtain the prior consentof the U.S.SR. and of the Dominion Governments.The general view of the War Cabinet, after discussion, was thatthese Governments had already assented to the conclusion of thearmistice with the Badoglio Government, and that the action nowproposed was only intended to strengthen the hands of that Govern-ment so as to enable them the better to comply with the armistice conditions. It was true that the draft applied the terms&apos;&apos; co-belligerent &apos;&apos; to the Badoglio Government. Nevertheless, itwas not felt that the step now proposed was one which need have the prior concurrence of the U.S.S.R. and Dominion Governments,although it would be appropriate to inform them of the action inhand and to say that we hoped that it would have their approval.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : (1) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was asked to revise the draft in accordance with the amendments suggested in discussion, in consultation with the deputy prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Air, andto arrange for its immediate despatch to the president and to the Resident Minister at Algiers, the latter beinginformed that he should not take action on the telegramuntil General Eisenhower had received instructions fromthe President.(2) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook toinform the Soviet Ambassador of the course proposed.(3) The Prime Minister undertook to send a personal telegram to Premier Stalin, in which he would set out the sequence of events; would explain the necessity under which we and the Americans felt bound to act promptly in this
matter, by virtue of the effect which this action wouldhave on the course of military events; and wouldconclude by saying that we trusted that this action wouldhave Premier Stalin&apos;s full approval as a matter ofmilitary diplomacy.(4) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was authorisedto inform the Dominion Prime Ministers of the course ofaction proposed.7. The War Cabinet considered a Note by the Lord Privy Seal(W.P. (43) 400) covering a Memorandum by the Colonial Officeregarding the compulsory recruitment of civilian labour for essential war work in East Africa.It was explained in the Memorandum that the application ofindustrial conscription for essential civilian purposes in East Africahad been severely criticised in Parliament; and in July 1943 theSecretary of State for the Colonies had informed the Governors of tanganyika and Kenya that, in view of the improvement in thegeneral strategic position, it would be necessary to show thatcompulsion was used only for strictly essential war purposes- andwas effectively controlled.Application had now been made by the Tanganyika SisalGrowers&apos; Association for 16,000 conscripts, and the Governorconsidered that 11,000 were required in order to prevent a fall in output. It was stated in the Memorandum that, from the long-termpoint of view, the Secretary of State for the Colonies would beprepared to recommend that the risk of a temporary drop in pro-duction should be accepted, in view of the serious effect of making available conscript African labour for private employers. he recognised, however, that the Supply Departments might feel unableto accept any risk of decreased production in critical industries, suchas sisal and pyre thrum. If, therefore, the War Cabinet should be unwilling to authorise the complete abolition of industrial conscrip-tion for war production in East Africa, he suggested (i) That all applications for the use of compulsory labour in east Africa should be submitted for prior approval bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies. A statement would be made, locally in East Africa but not in thiscountry, that the use of compulsory labour would infuture be limited to urgent work falling within certain specified categories,(ii) That, as regards the particular application in respect ofsisal in Tanganyika, the Governor should be authorisedto conscript not more than 11,000 Africans for a periodof six months; and should at the same time be instructedto report what alternative measures could be applied.In addition, an officer might be sent out from this countryto investigate the position on behalf of the Secretary ofState.In discussion, the Prime Minister said that there was no reason why labour in East Africa should not be subject to the same degreeof compulsion, during the war and for war purposes, as had beenaccepted by the people of this country, provided always that thesame safeguards were available to prevent the possibility ofexploitation for private profit. It was pointed out that the safe-guards available here, through the limitation of profits and thecontrol of prices, were not available in East Africa, and probablycould not be made available without radical alteration of the systemof taxation, &amp;c, obtaining in those territories.The general view of the War Cabinet was that a determined effort should be made to provide in East Africa such safeguards against exploitation for private profit as would enable us to justify
Mr. J.McGoYern, M.P.Visit to Eire.(previous reference:W.M.,(43) 92ndConclusions,Minute 1.)8. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityrecalled that it had been decided in July that Mr. J. McGoverri,M.P., might be given an exit permit for Northern Ireland, but thatthis should be granted on the understanding that he did not visitEire. In the event, Mr. McGovern had proceeded to Eire in breach of this understanding.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatin these circumstances he now proposed to inform Mr. McGovernthat he would not feel justified in granting any future applicationwhich he might make during the war for an exit permit to leave thiscountry for any destination.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the proposal of the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1;20th September, 1943.the application in those territories of the same degree of industrialconscription for the purposes of war production as was applied inthis country.The War Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Governor of Tanganyika should beauthorised to arrange for the compulsory recruitment of11,000 men to be employed, for a period of six monthsonly, in the sisal industry.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to arrangefor a thorough investigation into the application of the.principle of compulsory labour for war production in east Africa, preferably by the despatch of some person or persons from this country. The object of this investi-gation should be to ascertain how far it would be practicable to devise such safeguards against the exploi-tation of compulsory labour for private profit as would justify the application in East Africa of the same degreeof compulsory direction of labour to war production as has been applied in this country.

Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W-1.- MOST SECRET -W..M.  (43)  129.20 th September,    1945.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat Tie had now been informed by M. Molotov that theJapanese had made a very tentative approach to theRussian Government offering mediation between theRussians and the Germans.   The Russians had turneddown this offer definitely.The Foreign Secretary said   that, while we hadbeen careful to communicate to the Russians all thepeace feelers which had been made to us, this wasthe first occasion on which the Russians had made asimilar communication to us .   He had thanked theRussian Government for the&apos;information.
