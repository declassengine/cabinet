Naval, Militaryarid air operations.(previous kef erence:W.M. (43) 129thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Mediterranean.naval operations.Shipping Losses.Italian Shipping., 1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious eight days.Bomber Command had made three big attacks, two on Hanoverand one on Mannheim, dropping nearly 7,000 tons of bombs. Minorattacks had also been made on Oldenberg, Darmstadt andBrunswick. Coastal Command had made twelve attacks on U-boats,two of which had possibly been successful. One 6,000- and one,500-ton ship had been hit off the Dutch coast. Our losses duringthe week had been 97 bombers, 8 Coastal Command aircraft and,including United States aircraft, 36 fighters. Enemy losses,including those claimed destroyed by the United States Air Force,amounted to 137 destroyed and 60 probably destroyed.United States aircraft had attacked airfields and depots inNorthern France and enemy shipping at Nantes.  ,The high degree of the Allied air superiority in Italy had been maintained. Twenty-six enemy aircraft had been destroyedevacuating troops from Corsica. Total enemy losses had been48 aircraft as against 38 Allied.Confirmed and unconfirmed shipping losses by enemy action for the previous eight days amounted to 45,000 tons.Home Waters.SpitsbergenAtlantic.Military-OperationsItaly.2Egean.Pacific.Russia.The Prime Minister asked that a report should be submittedto him by the First Lord of the Admiralty, in consultation with theMinister of War Transport, about the proposed utilisation of italian merchant ships surrendered or seized in the Mediterranean.During an engagement off the Essex coast on the night of the24th-25th September our coastal forces had sunk one and damagedtwo E-boats and taken sixteen prisoners.  We had lost one trawler.The Tirpitz and Scharnhorst were still in Northern waters, butthe Lutzow had returned to the Baltic.Reinforcements had been sent to Spitsbergen following theGerman attack on the 8th-9th September.During the previous week, in the attack on the Atlantic convoy,4 U-boats had been claimed as sunk or probably sunk and5 damaged. These claims had not yet been assessed. Our losses amounted to 3 escort vessels and 2 merchant ships sunk and2 merchant ships abandoned. A further 2 had been abandoned but were still salvable.On the Salerno, front the 10th Corps were encountering very heavy German opposition, but had made some progress. The6th Corps had advanced about 15 miles on a 25-mile front. On theEast side of the peninsula the 13th Corps had advanced about70 miles in the past week. The 5th Army had been hampered intheir administrative arrangements by the lack of port facilities.The Germans had. destroyed the Apulian Aqueduct, whichcarried the water supply for the whole of the South-East corner ofItaly. Unless and until some emergency repairs could be made, itmight be necessary to import water into this area.All the German forces in Sardinia had been evacuated, mainly-through Corsica. The German withdrawal from Corsica was continuing, not without loss; and it was likely that this islandwould be completely cleared before very long.Detachments of British troops had been landed in the islands of Stampalia and Nicaria.A successful landing had been made at Finschhafen; and itwas believed that the Japanese in this area had been surrounded.The Japanese forces retreating from Lae had split up into smallparties, which were being separately pursued.The Russians had continued to make progress on all sectors of the front. The most important advances were those in theneighbourhood of Kiev. It was reported that the Russians had crossed the Dnieper at this point and had entered the suburbs ofKiev. To the South of the Dnieper bend German resistance hadbeen specially strong, probably in defence of the railway to theSouth, with a view to covering the withdrawal of their forces fromthe Crimea.[26165] . b 2
The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Shipping 2.   The Prime Minister said that he would be glad if theMinister of War Transport would prepare a statement showing the changes in the volume of shipping entering the main ports on theEast and West Coast (and in particular the Port of London) sincethe cessation of heavy air attacks on this country; and the extentto which it had been possible to resume coastwise shipping, moreparticularly on the East and South Coasts.German Long- 3.   The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidRange Rocket, that he thought the time had arrived when the Press should be givenclear guidance regarding reports which were now being receivedfrom foreign countries of a German long-range rocket. before taking any action, he would consult the Minister of Information andthose responsible for the collection of secret information on thissubject, and would.report to the Prime Minister what action he proposed to take.:The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.4. Some discussion took place about the agreement which hadbeen arrived at between Admiral Cunningham and the Italian naval commander-in-Chief regarding the treatment of Italian warshipsnow in Allied hands.The War Cabinet-Instructed General Ism ay to draw up and submit to thePrime Minister a statement of the events leading up to the signature by Admiral Cunningham of the agreement withthe Italian Commander-in-Chief as to the disposal of theItalian Fleet, with particular reference to the extent towhich (a) Admiral  Cunningham had been authorised tomake this agreement; and(b) the terms signed differed from those recommendedby the Chiefs of Staff.Italy.Surrender of the-Italian Fleet.british prisoners of Warin Italy.(previous reference:-W.M. (43) 127thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Secretary of State for War said that a relatively small proportion of the British prisoners of war in Italy who had been released by the Italians from prisoner-of-war camps had as yetmade their way into Switzerland or reached our lines. It was believed that some had been recaptured by the Germans and takento Germany, but that considerable numbers were still at large. TheGermans had issued a statement that all escaped prisoners of war should now report to German military authorities, and that thosewho did not obey this order and were subsequently captured witharms in their possession would be subjected to martial law.The Secretary of State for War read out a draft statement which he proposed should be issued, to the effect that any of our prisoners who were recaptured in Italy were entitled to be treated in all respects under the Prisoners-of-War Convention, and that any german officer who disregarded this Convention would be heldpersonally. responsible for his actions in this respect.
italy &apos; 6.   The War Cabinet were informed that the King of Italy(Previous had sent, through General Eisenhower, a message to His MajestyEeference:        The King and President Roosevelt (telegram N.A.F. 379) urgingW.M. (43) 129th the importance of securing that the largest possible area of ItalianConclusions,       territory should be freed from the Germans and, in particular, that minute 6.)        Allied troops should reach Rome at the earliest moment.   Mean-while, the request was made that the Badoglio Government shouldbe allowed to extend its jurisdiction over all those parts of Italy,including Sicily, which were occupied by the Allies.   It was alsoK asked that the Allies should fix for Italy a rate of exchange morefavourable than that which had been adopted in Sicily.The War Cabinet considered the draft of the reply which itwas proposed to recommend His Majesty to send to this message.This stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to agree,on a provisional basis, to the suggestion that the jurisdiction ofthe Badoglio Government should be extended to Sicily, and subse-&apos;quently to other areas on the mainland of Italy as they were clearedof the Germans, the authority of the Italian Government beingexercised under the supervision of the Allied Governments. At thesame time, it was made clear that this would not imply any recogni-tipn of the Badoglio Government as an Ally; nor would it restrict, : the freedom of the Italian people to choose after the war the form&apos; of democratic government which they preferred.   The opportunitywas taken to repeat the hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government that allanti-Fascist elements throughout Italy would range themselvesround the King and the Badoglio Government and that a coalition government, including all patriotic groups, would be formed withthe object of carrying on the struggle against the Germans with the; maximum force of the Italian people.As regards the rate of exchange, it was stated in the draft thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to consider the possibilityof an alteration, though there might be serious difficulties in theway of any such change.On this point the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that therate of exchange between the lira and the   sterling (400 lire tothe. ), fixed at the time of the invasion, of Sicily, had been a roughestimate. No adequate economic grounds had then been availableto determine what the rate should be; nor were there adequateeconomic grounds on which to base a variation of the rate thenfixed. It followed that any change in the rate now decided uponmust be determined by political considerations. It was likely,however, that the value of the lira would depreciate, particularly ifthe fighting in Italy were heavy and prolonged; and, in the Treasury-view, it was possible that before long conditions might arise inwhich even the present rate would be too favourable to the Italians.We might, therefore, put ourselves in a somewhat embarrassing position if we were now to increase the value of the lira.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that we should be open,to criticism if the rate fixed put our troops in an unduly favourable position in their purchases from the local inhabitants.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to provide thePrime Minister with a note of the Treasury view on this point, for communication to President Roosevelt.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the terms of the draft reply to the message fromthe King of Italy.The War Cabinet-Agreed in principle to the issue of a statement on theselines, subject to the terms being agreed between theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretaryof State for War.
(2) Iiivited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toarrange that the Governments of the United States andthe U.S.S.R. should be given an opportunity of com-menting on the terms of the draft reply, on the basis that, unless we heard to the contrary within five days,we should assume that they had no objection to ourrecommending His Majesty to reply to&apos;this message in.the terms proposed.ExpeditionaryForce Messages.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 118thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The War Cabinet reviewed their decision of the 23rd August&apos;that E.F.M. messages should be suspended for all countries for threeweeks over the Christmas period.When this decision had been reached, it had been contemplated that it would not be announced until November. The War cabinet were now informed that it was necessary that an announcement should be made in the near future. Its terms would: be so framed asto make clear the reasons why, on the experience of last year, it hadbeen decided to impose this restriction, which was necessitated bythe limited facilities for sending telegrams from this country to our troops overseas. Attention would also be drawn to the various alternative services available.The Secretary of State for War said that, following the^previous discussion in the War Cabinet, it had been arranged thatduring the Christmas period five extra letter-cards should be^allowed free of charge to members of the Forces serving overseas.Unless adequate air transport was available to carry these extraletter-cards, there would be considerable discontent.The Secretary of State for Air thought there would be nodifficulty in carrying all the airgraph traffic. Owing to weather conditions, however, it would be impossible to give an absoluteguarantee in regard to the carriage of air letters. He suggestedthat the only way of making sure of delivering this Christmas trafficAvould be for the Admiralty to make available a fast ship. Thiswould be of particular help as regards the carriage of the traffic between this country and Gibraltar.The Secretary of State for War agreed that, while this mightbe of value as an insurance against a breakdown in respect of theheavy Christmas traffic, he could not regard it as constituting an.adequate substitute for the provision of sufficient aircraft to carry the airgraph and air-letter traffic for troops abroad.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Postmaster-General and the Secretary of Statefor   War.   in   consultation,   to  make   the  necessaryannouncements in regard to the suspension of the E.F.M. &apos;service  for  all countries  for  three weeks  over  the christmas period.(2) Invited the First Sea Lord to investigate whether a fast,ship could be made available to assist in the arrange-ments for the carriage of the additional Christmasair-mail traffic for the troops overseas which wouldresult from the temporary suspension of the E.F.M.service.        _&apos;__t_South-East Asia 8. The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of a Memo-Command, randum by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence as to the(Previous organisation of Command, in India and South-East Asia (W.P. (43)Reference: 414). This-Paper superseded the proposals circulated in an earlierW.M. (43) H8th Paper (W.P. (43) 253), which had been revised in consultation with.Conclusions, the various military and civil authorities concerned.Minute 3.) Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,28th September, 1943.
