The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.The operations in the attack against Sicily were described.Air Operations. The preparations for the air attack on Sicilyhad begun immediately after the capture of Pantelleria, and arising scale of attack had reached its height during the previousweek. This had very greatly reduced the enemy s strength ofserviceable aircraft, in Sicily itself and in Southern Italy. Theairborne assault, despite adverse weather, had been very successful.The British airborne troops (in gliders) had landed North-West andSouth-West of Syracuse, and the American (parachute) troopsbehind the coast defences which they had to assault. During theactual landing from the sea the air opposition had been very light,but had increased somewhat during the 11th July. The air positionwould be difficult until we could operate fighters from the capturedaerodromes. ., Sea Operations. -The passage and arrival of British and american troops off the Sicilian beaches had gone as planned,although the weather, on which so much depended, had at the last moment become unfavourable. Most of the parties were landed atthe exact place and hour, except for a few which had been one hourlate. The weather affected the landing of the Americans more than ourselves, but fine seamanship had enabled the difficulties to be overcome. No enemy opposition had been experienced from surface craft. One hospital ship (which had been snowing lights) and oneUnited States destroyer had been sunk, and four other ships hadbeen lost on passage.Military Operations.,-^-The landings had been carried outaccording to plan, and with only slight casualties. All the first,and some of the second, objectives had been secured. Among ther towns and forts now in our hands were Syracuse, Pachino, Gela,Licata, Avola, Noto and Scoglitti. The morale of the Italian troopswas reported to be indifferent, and 6,000 prisoners had been taken up to date.During the next phase the major problem was likely to be thatof landing munitions and supplies sufficient to enable our forces tomaintain their operations. This task would, of course, be faciliated by the capture of Syracuse.During the previous week bad weather. had interfered withBomber Command operations. Cologne and Gelsenkirchen had been attacked. We had lost 21 bombers, 2 Coastal Command and 9 fighter aircraft. . .Enemy air losses up to the previous Friday had been 184aircraft destroyed, with 22 probably destroyed and 60 damaged-Allied losses had been 61 aircraft.Shipping losses by enemy action during the -previous week,. including belated reports, amounted to 135,000 tons. This figuredid not include two ships, one of 16,000 tons and another of20,000 tons, which had since been sunk by aircraft off cape finisterre. . Some discussion ensued as to whether ships in this area should be routed further away from land.In a night action in the Kula Gulf on the 5th July american naval forces claimed to have sunk 4 Japanese cruisers and driven1 cruiser and 5 destroyers ashore. United States submarines had sunk 9 enemy supply ships in this area. -The Russians continued to hold the German attacks in the area between Byelgorod and Orel. During the last few days the intensity of the attacks had apparently abated to some extent; but it was likely that this was only a temporary phase. It was to be expectedthat fierce fighting would continue in this sector for some time.The War Cabinet : Took note of these statements.[25749]
fJ^teimfc &apos;    &apos; 2.   The Se&amp;rei&amp;ty 6f(Previous&quot;       progress had been made hi; forming, a^newiPol^Reference:       following the death of General Sikorski.   M. Mikolajczyk. had;M(49)^ general conclusions.) -.&apos; S^nkowski as- Conunander-ih-Chief. There were,: however, some difficulties which had not yet been overcome- The main! issues were  -(a) M. Mikolajczyk maintained that the Commander-in-Chiefshould be subject to the directions of the Government. and not responsible only to the President.(6) The Prime Minister also considered that the Commander-in-Chief should not have a right of succession to the presidency in the event of the Presidents death. Thisarrangement had been acceptable to a majority of Poleswhile General Sikorski was Commander-in-Chief; but* there was no sufficient reason for conferring a similarright on his successor.(c) M. Mikolajczyk wished to have an assurance that he wouldin no circumstances be dismissed from office by thePresident.(d) At present the control of the Polish secret organisationsrested partly with the Polish Home Secretary and partlywith the Commander-in-Chief. M. Mikolajczyk desired that all these organisations should be brought under thecontrol of the Government.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadbeen asked for his views on these points. He had expressedsympathy with M. Mikolajczyk&apos;s views on the points mentioned at-(a) and (b); he had indicated that we should not feel able tosupport the Prime. Minister in his attitude on (c); and, asregards id), he had said that he would have thought that some suitable arrangements could be come to between the polish authorities.In discussion, it was suggested that it was most desirable thatthe British Press should avoid dwelling on the domestic difficultiesof the Polish Government; and the Minister of Information was invited to consider what.he could do to influence the newspapersin this matter.The War Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.Funeral ofGeneralSikorski.(previous reference:W.M.(43)94thConclusions,Minute 4.)3.. The Secretary of State for War drew attention to thefailure of the Great Western Railway to make satisfactory arrange-ments for the reception at Paddington Station of the coffincontaining General Sikorski&apos;s body.The War Cabinet-Asked the Minister of War Transport to take this matter up with the railway company.Casualties and damage.; [ ;^Previous ..Reference:W.M.(43)85thConclusions,Minute 3.)4., The Home Secretary and Minister of Borne Securitysaidthat during the afternoon of the 9th July ten enemy aircraft had made low-nying attacks,, in cloud, on Croydon, Orpington, Hastingsand East Grinstead. Two of these aircraft were destroyed. Thetotal casualties were 83 killed and 56 seriously injured.The most; serious incident was at East Grinstead, where heavy casualties were caused by a direct hit on a cinema.It was pointed out in discussion that the distress caused by such an incident as this, in a small and compact town like EastGrinstead, was disproportionate to the actual number of casualties.;
The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement, and invited the lH6me; Secretary and Minister of Home Security to considerwhether a message of sympathy might not be sent to theChairman of the Urban District Councilof East Gr insteadon behalf of the War Cabinet.Basic English. 5.   The Prime Minister referred to the advantages whichmight follow if Basic English were widely used as a means ofinterchange of thought throughout the world. He suggested thatthis matter might be the subject of preliminary examination in itsbroad aspects by a Committee of Ministers.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet appointed aCommittee comprising The Secretary of State for India (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The President of the Board of Education,The Minister of Information,The Secretary, Department of Overseas Trade,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Parliamentary Secretary, Board of Education,     -to consider whether action should be taken to promote the spread of basic English, and, if so, to recommend a programme of action.It should be open to the Committee to consider alternatives to basic English, such as &quot;Essential English.&quot;Parliament.Motion in theHouse of lords on Armament ofBomberAircraft.(previous reference erence:W.M. (43) 16th.Conclusions,Minute 10.)6. The Lord Privy Seal said that Lord Mansfield had putdown a Motion to ask His Majesty&apos;s Government whether they were satisfied with the defensive fire-power of our heavy bombers.Lord Mansfield had not accepted a suggestion that he should take this Motion off the Paper, and the Lord Privy Seal proposed toinform him that if the matter was debated it would have to be in secret Session. In accordance with the arrangement made inJanuary last, he asked that the War Cabinet should endorse thisdecision. -The War Cabinet-Approved the course proposed.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,12th July, 1943.
