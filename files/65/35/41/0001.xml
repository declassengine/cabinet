Shipping. 1.   At their Meeting on the 4th August the War Cabinet hadIndian grain considered the request of the Government of India for the shipmentrequirements, of 500,000 tons of wheat between September 1943 and February(Previous 1944 to relieve the acute shortage of food in India; and hadEeferenee: authorised the Minister of War Transport to arrange for w.M. (43) 111th 100,000 tons of barley to be sent to India from Iraq and for conclusions 50,000 tons of wheat to be sent from Australia to Colombo to awaitMinute 1.) &apos;     instructions there.The War Cabinet now considered Memoranda by the Chiefs ofStaff and the Secretary of State for India (W.P. (43) 407 and 411)asking that the position should be reconsidered in view of thecontinued deterioration of the food situation in India.The Chiefs of Staff endorsed the view of the Commander-in-Chief, India, that it was of the highest importance, from the strategical point of view, that the Government of India shouldreceive all possible aid in dealing with the food situation; and pointed out that, if the position continued to deteriorate, the efficient prosecution of the war against Japan by forces based on india would be gravely jeopardised.The Secretary of State for India in his Memorandum said thatfamine conditions, were developing in the industrial areas in India,particularly in Bengal. He outlined the long-term measures whichwere being taken to deal with the unsatisfactory economic positionin India; but he explained that these could not take effect in timeto mitigate the difficulties which seemed certain to arise before theend of the year. These could only be met by the early despatch ofadditional supplies of food grains to India, and he urged the WarCabinet to review their earlier decision and to give, a firm assurance that 500,000 tons of cereals&apos; would be shipped to India before march 1944. .The Viceroy-Designate supported the request made by theSecretary of State for India. He said that more than a year ago,when Commander-in-Chief in India, he had found it necessary tomake the strongest representations on the Viceroy&apos;s ExecutiveCouncil regarding the need for increasing the supplies of foodavailable in India. The shortages had been such that it had been necessary to reduce the rations of the Indian Army and the Army&apos;sfood reserves had at one time fallen to a very low level. Theposition appeared to be even worse at the present time; and therewas a grave risk that military operations would be jeopardised ifsufficient food were not made available, not only for the Army, butalso for the industrial populations, on whose efforts our militaryoperations depended.The Minister of War Transport said that, although theshipping situation generally had been eased by the recentdiminution in sinkings, this did not make it easier to relieve India&apos;s immediate needs; for it would not be possible to work additionalships into positions from which they could lift grain for deliveryin India before the next Indian harvest. The 50,000 tons of wheat which the War Cabinet had previously authorised him to move toColombo was already being loaded; and shipment of the 100,000 tonsof barley from Iraq could begin at the rate of 20,000/30,000 tons amonth, as soon as the Ministry of Food had finally determined theprice. (The Minister of Food indicated that this would be settledwithin the course of the next few days.) The only means by whichhe could make additional supplies available was to ship a further30,000 tons of barley from the stocks which were being built up inthe Middle East with a view to supplying the irregular forces operating against the enemy in the Balkans, and to divert another30,000 tons of wheat and flour which was now being sent to theMiddle East to augment those stocks. If these additional measures were authorised, he would be able to ship a total of 210,000 tons offood grains to India by the end of the year. The result would be,however, to reduce substantially the stocks which we had been trying to accumulate in the Middle East for the supply of the Balkans;[26136] b 2
and he saw little prospect of being able to build up those stocksagain before the end of the year.In discussion, attention was drawn to the disadvantages ofdiminishing the stocks which were being accumulated for possible use in the Balkans, since these were already far smaller than wecould wish. At the same time, it was recognised that India&apos;s needswere urgent, and there seemed to be no other source from which theycould be supplied. It was felt, however, that not more than amaximum of 50,000 tons should be withdrawn from these stocks.The Secretary of State for India pressed that some assuranceshould be given to the Government of India regarding shipments inthe first quarter of 1944.The view of the War Cabinet was, however, that at this stagewe should concentrate on shipments up to the end of 1943, andshould review the position again in the light of the Indian harvests.Meanwhile, any further supplies that might become available shouldbe shipped only as far as the Middle East. From there they couldeither be sent forward to India, or stored for use in the Balkans,according to the relative needs of the two areas at the end ofthe year.The War Cabinefs Conclusions were as follows : (1) The Minister of War Transport should aim at shipping atotal of 200,000 tons of food grains to India by the endof 1943. This would be made up of the 150,000 tonsauthorised by the War Cabinet at their meeting on the4th August and a further 50,000 tons to be withdrawnfrom the stocks already accumulated in the Middle East,or en route for the Middle East, for the supply of the balkans.(2) The position should be reviewed again at the end of the year in the light of the Indian harvests.(3) Meanwhile, the Minister of War Transport should take any opportunity that offered of shipping further suppliesof food grains to the Middle East so that they would beavailable in 1944, either for onward shipment to Indiaor to augment the supplies which were being accumulatedfor the Balkans.(4) The Secretary of State for India should inform the Govern-ment of India that it would be out of the question forus to arrange for the import of anything like1,000,000 tons of food grains annually into India. Everyeffort must therefore be made to remedy the long-termsituation by internal measures in India.India. 2.   On the 30th August the War Cabinet had invited theInternal Minister of War Transport, in consultation with the Secretary of transportation. State for India, to arrange for an enquiry to be made into the(Previous internal transportation position in India, as recommended in reference- paragraph 14 of the Sixth Report of the Shipping Committee.wi\/T (A%\i9c\th The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theConclusion^ Secretary of State for India (W.P. (43) 405) setting out the minute 5) &apos; suggestions which had been put to the Viceroy to implement theseinu e Conclusions, and the Viceroy&apos;s reply.   The Viceroy agreed to theproposal that two railway experts should go to India, but made certain alternative suggestions for the Committee which it was proposed should report on the availability of Indian exports for shipment.The War Cabinet (1) Took note that the Viceroy had welcomed the proposal that two railway experts should go to India, who would put their experience and advice at the disposal of the Indianauthorities, and of whom one would be an American
expert, and authorised the Secretary of State for India,in consultation with the Minister of War Transport, totake urgent steps to give effect to it.(2) Approved the Viceroy&apos;s suggestion, described in para-graph 4 of W.P. (43) 405, for the preparation, by aSub-Committee of the Government of India&apos;s CentralPriorities Committee, of an estimation of the quantityof Indian exports which could be brought to seaboard,subject to detailed consideration, in consultation withthe Viceroy, of the points mentioned in paragraphs 5and 6 of W.P. (43) 405.Food Production 3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thein Liberated Minister of Economic Warfare (W.P. (43) 401) stating &apos; thatEurope. hitherto, in pursuance of our policy of reducing the foodstuffs(Previous        available to the enemy, our propaganda had exhorted people in reference:      occupied Europe to take all possible steps to prevent agriculturalW.M. (43) 63rd products from reaching the Germans.   In view of the present foodConclusions,     conditions in enemy-occupied Europe, and the limited possibilitiesMinute 5.)      of making good European food deficiencies after the war, theMinister invited the War Cabinet to consider whether we shouldnot now reverse our policy and expressly deprecate the destructionof crops in occupied Europe, except in the last resort.The War Cabinefs Conclusions were as follows : (1) The time had now been reached when we should cease propa-ganda directed to discouraging sowings and encouraging the destruction of crops in occupied Europe.(2) For the present our propaganda should be silent on thissubject. It would be undesirable that we should nowspecifically encourage additional food production in enemy-occupied Europe, but the matter should be further considered before the spring sowings.(3) The Minister of Economic Warfare was invited to arrangefor the issue of specific instructions in the above sense.Four-Power 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theDeclaration. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (43) 412) reporting(Previous the amendments suggested by Dominion Governments to the termsReference: of the Four-Power Declaration proposed by the United StatesW.M. (43) 124th Government. The correspondence with the Dominion GovernmentsConclusions, was set out in the Annexes to the Memorandum.Minute 3.) The main point dealt with in discussion was the australian government proposal that &quot; The British Commonwealth ofNations should be named and treated as one of the four great powers.&quot;The view was generally expressed that the attitude of canada and South Africa made this impracticable. Moreover, we could not undertake a formal commitment that on every occasion action mustbe held up until complete agreement had been reached with each ofthe Dominions.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to settlewhich of the suggestions of the Dominion governments could be accepted, and to concert the terms of the replies to be sent to the Dominion Governments, without further reference to the War Cabinet.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,. 2Ath September, 1943.
