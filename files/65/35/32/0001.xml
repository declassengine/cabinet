The War Cabinet considered the latest developments of theiPrevious        Italian position.Reference: . . .....W.M.(43) 121st The discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded in conclusions,     tne Secretary&apos;s Standard -File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Minute 2.)Anglo-Soviet- 3.   In reply to messages sent to him by the Prime Minister and american President Roosevelt at the outset of the Quebec Conference,Conference. Premier Stalin had said that, while (the military situation on the(Previous Eastern Front made it impossible fbr him to leave Russia at the reference: present time to attend a meeting with President Roosevelt and theW.M.(43) 114th Prime Minister, he thought it desirable that there Should be an conclusions, early meeting of responsible representatives of the three StatesMinute ,2.) in order that^questions of common interest might be examined and proposals submitted for the approval of the three Governments.Premier Stalin had been informed that the Prime Minister and president Roosevelt accepted in principle this proposal for aConference of Foreign Secretaries, and would submit detailedsuggestions for such a meeting as quickly as possible.The War Cabinet now. considered the following telegrams on-    this subject: - -r Concrete No. 692, dated the 2nd September, from the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs to the Prime Minister.Welfare No. 582, dated the 3rd September, from the PrimeMinister to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.       -In his telegram the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had suggested that the best place of meeting for the proposed conference would be in London. There was reason to believe that both M. Molotov and Mr. Hull might be willing to come to London;and, even if Mr. Hull were unable to make the journey, the UnitedStates Government could be represented by Mr. Winant. It wouldprobably be inexpedient for us to show too much eagerness to go to moscow. London was a convenient half-way house between moscow and Washington; and on the whole it seemed preferable that theConference should be held there.The Prime Minister in his telegram, which had been despatchedbefore he received the telegram from the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, said that President Roosevelt, while not opposedto a meeting in London, was inclined to favour a meeting at someplace in this country outside London.The view of the War Cabinet was that, if the Conference Wereto be held in this country, the balance of advantage lay in holdingit in London.As regards the Agenda, the Prime Minister had  jointed outin his telegram that it would, be difficult to discuss military questions at this Conference. On this point the view of the War cabinet was that, while it would be preferable that military questions shouldbe reserved for Staff conversations, the Soviet Government were likely to resist any attempt to exclude military questions entirely from the Agenda of this Conference. It would be undesirable toallow the arrangements for the Conference to break down, or strongSoviet resentment to develop, by opposing too persistently a Soviet
W.M. 122 (43).suggestion that military questions should not be excluded from thescope of the Conference.The Prime Minister had suggested in his telegram that themain business of the Conference should be to discuss four or fivemajor issues of policy in connection with the post-War settlement,e.g., the fate of Germany. He thought that some of these subjectsmight be suggested by ourselves and others by the United StatesGovernment, and that Premier Stalin should be invited to suggestothers.These suggestions were endorsed by the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in thelight of the discussion, to send a further telegram to thePrime Minister developing the arguments in favour of holding this Conference in London, and explaining theWar Cabinefs views on the suggestions made in para-graphs 4-7 of the Prime Minister&apos;s telegram WelfareNo. 582. ..Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,3rd September, 1943.
