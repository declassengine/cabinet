Educational i   TJie War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the reform. President;Of the Board of Education (WP. (43) 299) covering the(Previous draft of a White Paper setting out his proposals for post-warReference:      educational reform.W.M. (42) 150th      It was explained in the Memorandum that these proposals had conclusions,    been considered by the Lord Presidents Committee* and had their minute 3.)      support. Substantial progress had been made with the preparationof the necessary legislation; but it was thought preferable that thegeneral scheme of the proposed reforms should be presented toParliament and the public, in the first instance, in the form of a white Paper, and that an opportunity should be given for public discussion and the formation of public opinion before the Bill was finally completed and introduced.  It was therefore proposed that,if its terms were approved by the War Cabinet, the White Paper.    should be presented to&apos; Parliament on the 16th July, but that the Billw -.:       should not be introduced until the next Session. .The War Cabinet were informed that there would be a general desire to debate these proposals in the House of Commons before theend of the present Session-. The intention was to offer facilities fora debate,, if necessary over two days, about a fortnight after the presentation of the White Paper.It had been suggested that the President of the Board ofEducation should give a broadcast talk on his proposals on the dayof publication of the White Paper. It was, however, the general feeling of the War Cabinet that, as there was to be a full debate inthe House of Commons, the President should make his first publicexplanation of his proposals on that occasion.In.paragraph 3 of the Appendix to the White Paper it was. explained it was not proposed to introduce any of these proposals&quot;until the end of the war in Europe.&quot;   The Chancellor of theExchequer suggested that the words &quot;in Europe&quot; should be omitted from this sentence.  This suggestion was approved.The Prime Minister asked what progress had been made in the.use of instructional films in the schools. The President of the Boardof Education undertook to send the Prime Minister a memorandumon this question.The War Cabinet-. &apos;    (1) Endorsed the proposals for educational reform set out in; the draft White Paper annexed to W.P. (43) 299; and approved the terms of that draft subject to the amend-ment suggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(2) Authorised the President of the Board of Education topresent the White Paper to Parliament on the 16th july and took note that arrangements would be made for theseproposals to be debated in the House of Commons beforethe, end of the present Session.Parliament.redistribution of Parlia-mentary seats.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 89thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. In his Memorandum (W.P. (43) 274) the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security had suggested that the proposed legislation providing for the immediate appointment of a Commis-sion to recommend a scheme of redistribution should also createpermanent redistribution machinery on the lines recommended inthe Report of the Departmental Committee on Electoral Machinery.At their meeting on the 28th June the War Cabinet had asked that this suggestion should be considered in the first instance by the ministerial Committee on Electoral Machinery.The War Cabinet now had before them a further Memorandumby the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P.(43) 304) reporting that.the Ministerial Committee fully endorsed the suggestion which he had put forward in his earlier Memo-randum. He therefore sought authority to make ah early statement in the House of Commons, in the terms of the draft annexed toW.P. (43) 304, announcing the Governments intention to introduce legislation making permanent provision fpr adjusting constituencies-cies to future changes in the distribution of population.* L.P. (43) 46th Meeting.
149W.M. 98 (43).The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said, that,when this: matter had been before them on the previous occasion,the &quot;War Cabinet had been anxious to ensure that Parliament would retain control over all measures of redistribution. The Bill whichhe now proposed would set out the general principles on which any scheme of redistribution should; be based, and would provide forthe appointment of a standing body of Boundary Commissionerswho Would keep the state of the constituencies under review andwould be in a position to prepare schemes of redistribution whenoccasion arose. The Commissioners would not, however, beempowered to make recommendations for redistribution until theyhad been authorised by Parliament on any particular occasion todo so, and the schemes which they prepared would have to be presented for approval by Parliament. It was not the intention thatthese reviews should take place at frequent intervals as a rule itWould not be necessary to hold more than one such review in thenormal lifetime of &amp; Parliament and under the arrangements proposed complete control over all measures of redistribution would remain, with Parliament. . &apos;&apos;The Secretary of State for Air said that, as mentioned inparagraph 4 of W.P. (43) 304, a number of Members of parliament had tabled a Motion urging the appointment of a representativeconference to consider the question of electoral reform. In anyDebate on this Motion there would certainly be raised the questionof proportional representation, which, if accepted, would affectredistribution; and he therefore suggested that the Governmentshould not commit themselves as regards redistribution untilParliament had been given an opportunity for such a Debate.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securitysaid thatthis point had been considered by the Ministerial Committee on electoral Machinery; and the majority of the members of that committee had felt that Parliamentary discussion of proportional representation or other measures of electoral reform could not be prejudiced by an early announcement of the Governments intentionto make permanent provision for redistribution. If at some later stage it were decided to introduce some measure of proportional representation, a major Bill would clearly be necessary, and anyfurther amendments then required in respect of redistribution couldbe incorporated in that Bill. If this point were raised in parliament on the occasion of the proposed statement about redistribution, itcould be made clear that this proposal would not prejudicesubsequent discussion of electoral reform.The War Cabinet-    &apos;(1) Approved the proposals in W.P. (43) 274 and 304 for theintroduction of legislation making permanent provisionfor adjusting constituencies to future changes in thedistribution of population.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary and Minister of home security to announce this decision in the House ofCommons in the terms outlined in the Appendix toW.P. (43) 304.Post-Was?CM!        3.   The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that aait iransport. reply had now been received from the Canadian Government to the(Previous       telegram addressed to them on the 30th June (No. 114).    TheyReference:      thought that it was inadvisable to hold a meeting between nationsW.M.(43)88th of the Commonwealth prior to a meeting with the United States,Conclusions.)   since, in their view, this would lessen the chances of gettingsubstantial international agreement.   The Canadian government therefore regretted that they could not participate in meetings withrepresentatives of other nations of the Commonwealth in advanceof the proposed international meeting with the United States.  The
Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.nth July, 1943.Canadian Government also made clear that ;they had intended thatthe: preliminary talks at Ottawa should be restricted to Officials, andshould not be on the Ministerial level.The view expressed by the War Cabinet was that we could notacquiesce in the position that there was anything objectionable inpreliminary consultation between members of the British Common-wealth and .Empire, before international discussions with othercountries. One solution of the difficulty might how be that, in lieu of the Canadian Government- issuing invitations to a Conference at ottawa, we should issue invitations to a Conference to be heldelsewhere.It was proposed that our next step should be discussed at anearly date by the Ministerial Committee on Post-War Civil air transport. &apos;The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.
