toXt&apos;.&apos;;T;hey War Cabinet had before them.a Memorandum by theSecretary &apos;bf State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (43) 286) recom-&quot; mending that a declaration should be made by the Governments ofneutrak not to ajj the United Nations solemnly warning neutral Governments notMf^;^^10&apos; to afford asylum to enemy leaders and war criminals. The Secretary(Previous Qf State for Foreign Affairs sought authority to invite the Govern-reference: ments of all the United Nations to participate in a declaration in w.M. (42) 131st tjje tgj-jQs 0f the draft annexed to his Memorandum.Conclusions, The War Cabinet also had before them a Memorandum by the minute 7.) Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (W.P. (43) 293) commenting on the proposals in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.      &apos;The main point dealt with in discussion was whether it waspremature to make a declaration in the sense proposed at this, juncture. It wais stated that this course would probably befavoured by several of the Allied Governments, who were interestednot so much in what would happen to a limited number of outstanding enemy leaders (in whose case public trial was unlikely to be a suitable procedure*), but rather in regard to crimesri committed by enemy nationals other than the outstanding leaders;for example, German officers who were known to have taken a prominent part in maltreating Allied nationals in concentrationcamps.The &quot;War, Cabinet were also reminded that Lord Vansittart hadthe following Motion for discussion in the House of Lords : &quot;To ask His Majesty&apos;s Government, whether they havetaken, or intend to take, any steps to ensure that no German. criminal shall find asylum in any neutral country; and to movefor Papers.&quot; ..&apos;* On the other hand, it was urged that there was no immediateneed for action on the lines proposed, and that action in this matter would be more effective if it was taken nearer the time when theenemy&apos;s resistance was finally breaking.The War Cabinefs decisions were as follows :-(1) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was asked tobring his Paper again before the War Cabinet in threemonths&apos; time. In the meantime, he should consult the sUnited States Government informally, and ascertain whether they would prefer that the proposed warning to neutrals should be delivered publicly or. privately.. : (2) Lord Vansittart Land others who were interested in thismatter could be informed privately that we were in communication with other Allied Governments on thisI..v- subject, but that we thought that a public statement onthe matter at this juncture would be premature. -2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of Statefor India (W.P. (43) 267) pointing out that there had been severalrecent indications that the Chinese Government intended to presstheir claim that Tibet was part of China, and that the point was likely to come up when any question affecting Tibet was underdiscussion with the Chinese Government: The approval of the WarCabinet was therefore sought to the line which it was proposed thatHis Majesty&apos;s representatives and others concerned should take inthis event. Briefly, it was proposed^-    \ -(a) that they should avoid committing us to recognition of-        Chinese suzerainty over Tibet unconditionally andindependently   of   China&apos;s- acceptance, of . Tibetan&apos;. autonomy; and &apos;* See W.P. (42) 264, paragraph 7.t
(6) that, if necessary, a warning should be added that, if theChinese attemptedtoupset Tibetan autonomy, we shouldhave to consider withdrawal of our recognition of chinese suzerainty.The War Cabinet-Agreed that guidance should be given to His Majesty&apos;s. . representatives, and others concerned, on these lines;NortbecnMr. Maybank.(previous reference.erence:W.M. (42) 76thConclusions.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (43) 264) informing them of recent developments with regard to the detention and deportation-tion of Mr. Maybank, late General Secretary of the Northern Rhodesian Mine-Workers&apos; Union. The General Council of theTrades Union, Congress had asked the Secretary of State to reopen the case on the grounds that the Governor had acted in a high-handed manner and that Mr. Maybank had been deported becauseof his Trade Union activities. Both these suggestions wereunfounded and there could be no question of altering the decision which had been taken. The Secretary of State therefore proposedthat Sir Walter Citrine should be informed that the Governor ofNorthern Rhodesia had acted with the full support of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and that, in the absence of any new facts, there was no ground for. reconsidering the decision taken.The War Cabinet-Agreed to the course proposed.Funeral of 4.   The War Cabinet agreed that facilities should be given toGeneral the Polish Government to organise a public funeral for GeneralSikorski. Sikorski in this country. -The War Cabinet-&apos; Asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toarrange for an Inter-Departmental Committee to be set- up, with representatives of the Foreign Office, the HomeOffice, the War Office, and other interested Departments.This Committee should be charged with making all thenecessary arrangements, reporting as need be to the secretaries of State for-Foreign Affairs, for the Home.,Department and for War.FaspigaadaPolicy.(Previous .reference:W.M. (43)93rdConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a telegram received from the President (No. 304) saying that he was in entire agreement with the telegram despatched after this matter had beenconsidered by the War Cabinet on Monday, and proposing that thedeclaration should be sent out over the names of the President andthe Prime Minister, but not until after initial success had been assured.-The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that a reply hadbeen sent agreeing to this course and making the necessary* amendments in the terms of the draft declaration. ,Offices of the.War Cabinet, S.W. 1,7th July, IMS.
