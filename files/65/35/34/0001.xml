(43) 123rd -;- ---Conclusions, -Minute 2.)FoutvPowev 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theDeclaration.      Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (43) 389) containing the draft d  a Four-Power Declaration handed to him by Mr. Hullin Quebec, together with a copy of a telegram which he (theSecretary pf State for Foreign Affairs) had sent to the Prime-&apos;Minister on the 3k* september&apos;w^v&apos;cojKba^ing - his- comments on this
document. Copies were also attached of two previous telegrams to Quebec, containing the preliminary observations of the Foreign Office.

The discussion in the War Cabinet centred round the following words in paragraph 4 of the draft declaration. ...based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all nations ... The view was expressed that this phrase might be taken to imply that each nation&apos;s voice should carry equal weight in the proposed general international organisation for the maintenance of international peace and security. The phrase might therefore lead to misunderstandings, and it might be desirable to substitute some other words. One suggestion made for meeting this difficulty was the reinsertion in this paragraph of the words open to membership by all nations. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that he had proposed the omission of those words lost they might be regarded as applicable to the enemy Powers immediately on the conclusion of hostilities.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he thought the best plan would be that he should send a further telegram to the Prime Minister setting out the doubts which had been expressed, in the War Cabinet in regard to these phrases, and perhaps suggesting an alternative form of words.

As regards procedure, it was contemplated that after the Prime Minister had communicated with the United States Government, on the receipt of the War Cabinet&apos;s View, the United States Government would send the draft officially to ourselves and to the Russian Government, and that at this stage the draft declaration would be communicated to the Dominion Governments.

The War Cabinet--

Took note of these statements and invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to proceed as at "X."

Russian Delegation to the Trade Union Congress.

4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs invited the attention of the War Cabinet to the Statement in the Press that an important Delegation from Russia, headed by M Nicolai Shvernik, had arrived in this country to attend the Trades Union Congress at Southport. He thought that it might be useful that some of his colleagues should see the leader of the Delegation, and also that the Government should invite the Delegation to an official lunch. 

The War Cabinet--

Agreed with the course proposed
