Parliament.Business ofthe House.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 128thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The War Cabinet were informed that many labour members were concerned at the growing unrest in the coalfieldsand were reluctant that Parliament should disperse for theremainder of the Recess without a full Debate on the coal mining industry. At a meeting of Labour Members held that morning ithad been decided to ask that Parliament should meet during thefollowing week for the purpose of such a Debate.In discussion it was pointed out that the only urgent question was that of the direction of surface workers to underground workin the mines; and that this matter could properly be discussedduring the general Debate on Man-Power which was to be held onthe two following clays. Other questions relating to the Govern-ment&apos;s control over coalmining operations were less urgent and couldbe discussed in a subsequent Debate on the work of the Ministryof Fuel and Power which could be held after the ParliamentaryRecess.The Minister of Fuel and Power saw advantage in separatingthe two issues.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : -Those Labour Members who were anxious for a debate should be informed through the normal channels that thequestion of directing surface workers to work undergroundcould properly be discussed during the course of the forth-coming Debate on Man-Power; and that the Government wouldbe prepared to give facilities for a full day&apos;s discussion of other questions relating to the mining industry on the first day afterthe Parliamentary Recess (i.e., 12th October). If in spite ofthis explanation the request for an earlier Debate were pressed,the Labour Members should be told that the Government were willing to give facilities for a Debate on the coal mining industry at a special sitting to be held either on the day afterParliament was to have adjourned (i.e., Saturday, the25th September) or on the day before it was to havereassembled (i.e., Monday, the 11th October).Meeting of 2.   In April the War Cabinet had invited the Secretary ofDominion State for Dominion Affairs to ascertain whether it would bePrime practicable to hold during the summer a Meeting of Prime MinistersMinisters. or other Ministers representing the Governments of the British(Previous Commonwealth and Empire. It had not been found practicable to reference: arrange for such a Meeting to be held at that time. On theW.M (43)49th 8th September the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs had,Conclusions, at the Prime Minister&apos;s request, sent a further invitation to minute 1.) Dominion Governments&quot;with a. view to a meeting of Dominion PrimeMinisters in London in November.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (43) 404) to whichwere annexed the replies received to this further invitation. It was recommended in the Memorandum that every effort should now bemade to ensure that such a meeting took place at the earliest opportunity. A stage had now been reached at which it was essential that there should be a full discussion between the Headsof the constituent States of the British Commonwealth on post-war policy and on the machinery whereby, in collaborating with the major Allies, the Commonwealth would be enabled to express a united view. For this purpose we should press for a meeting not later than January 1944.The Prime. Minister endorsed the above proposals, which wouldnot, however, interfere with the earlier arrivaf in this country ofField-Marshal Smuts.The Secretary of State for India suggested that the Governmentof India should also be invited to send representatives. Most of thematters which would be discussed were of vital interest to India,
and many of them were matters which fell within the recognisedjurisdiction of the Government of India. He drew attention to thefact that in 1921 a conference, specially designated as one of PrimeMinisters, was also attended by Indian representatives, and that since the last war the position of India, both at all Empire meetings and at Geneva, had been assimilated to that of the Dominions.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theposition had, of course, been altered by the Statute of Westminster.Further, the meeting now proposed was a meeting of PrimeMinisters, and there was no one who was in a position to representIndia at such a meeting.The War Cabinet accepted the view that India could not participate on equal, terms in a meeting of Prime Ministers.At the same time, it was recognised that India ought to berepresented in the discussion of some of the problems whichwere likely to come under review. The difficulties of this situation could best be overcome if Representatives of India at the WarCabinet were already in this country at the time when theConference was held. It could no doubt be arranged that theseRepresentatives of India should be invited by the Prime ministers to take part at some of their discussions.The War Cabinet  &apos;(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to urge the Dominion Prime Ministers to do their utmost toarrange to attend a Meeting of Prime Ministers inLondon in January 1944.(2) Agreed that the question of Indian representation at thisMeeting could best be dealt with on the lines suggested at &quot;X&quot; above; and invited the Secretary of Statefor India to arrange for the Indian Representatives atthe War Cabinet to pay a further visit to this country,arriving in advance of the elate proposed for the Meetingof Prime Ministers.Ireland. 3.   The   War   Cabinet   had   before   them   the   following(Previous Memoranda regarding the communication which PresidentReference: Roosevelt was thinking of sending to Mr. de Valera regarding theW.M.

(43) 409 by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security.The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion of the issues raised by these Memoranda.
