Otaio (10,298 tons), which had dispersed from anOperations.       outward-bound convoy, had been torpedoed and sunk.   The totalShipping Losses, shipping losses in August so far reported were about 96,000 tons.Military The Russians had lost much ground during the last week and operations. the position in the Leningrad and Southern Sectors must now be.S.S.E. reckoned as serious.In the Karelian Isthmus the Russians were back at their oldfrontier. In Estonia the Germans had taken Tallinn (Reval). it looked as though the communications of Leningrad might besevered within the next few days.On the Gomel sector the Germans were developing a strongarmoured thrust to the south-east.They were believed to have established a bridgehead across theRiver Dnieper at Dneipropetrovsk and were fighting for othercrossings on the Southern Dnieper, particularly in the Berislavarea. The report that the Russians had destroyed the Dnieper Damwas believed to be correct.There was no sign whatever of the Soviet Government giving up the fight.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Authorised the Permanent Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to instruct Sir Stafford Cripps to impress upon the Soviet Government the vitalimportance of sinking the Russian Baltic Fleet in theevent of Leningrad and Kronstadt falling.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M.

The Prime Minister said that it was clear that, thisMeeting would be mainly concerned with long-term requirements.He very much hoped that the Minister of Supply would see his wayto heading our Delegation to Russia. An announcement on thismatter would have to be made in the near future. As to date, weshould say that our delegation was ready to start as soon as theUnited States Delegation reached this country. Our delegation should be ready to leave at the end of the present month.The War Cabinet approved the above arrangements, andthe Minister of Supply expressed his willingness to under-take this Mission.Munitions 3   The chief 0f the imperiai General Staff referred to theProduction.       capture of German 7 - 92-mm. lachrymatory armour-piercing bullets.7 * 92 m xxiLachrymatory ^ar Cabinet invited the Secretary of State for WarBullet to consult with the Minister of Supply regarding themanufacture of a similar bullet.United States ofAmerica.Public opinion and supplies.(previous reference:W.M.

(41) 208).The Prime Minister explained that, in the circumstances, hethought that the best solution would be for Mr. Fadden to send tothis country either a special envoy or perhaps a Mission toascertain our views regarding the use of Australian troops in the.Middle East and the position in the Pacific. If and when such a mission arrived, it could meet the Chiefs of Staff and certain ministers, when our views on these two subjects could be explained.The War Cabinet warmly endorsed the terms of this telegram.Persia.(previous reference :W.M.

The Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs saidthat instructions were being sent to our Minister in Tehran that theGermans in Persia were to be prevented from leaving the countryand handed over to our authorities. We could then settle how theyshould be disposed of.Discussion followed as to whether the staff of the GermanLegation at Tehran should also be removed. -It was pointed outthat, when we had asked for the expulsion of Germans from Persia,we had said that the German Legation could remain. The position,however, was now altered, and we were entitled to take a new view.There was a difficulty, however, inasmuch as the Germans had asked

The War Cabinet were informed that General de gaulle had now arrived in England.The Prime Minister said that, in view of General de Gaulle&apos;sdisturbing behaviour in recent weeks, Departments should for thetime being adopt a cautious and dilatory attitude towards allrequests made by the Free French.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of these instructions.(ii) Invited the Minister of Information to take steps toprevent General de Gaulle from delivering a broadcastthat evening, as part of a programme arranged underAmerican auspices of speeches by the heads or represen-tatives of Allied Powers.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the milk for Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P.

Theyhad said they could only supply 231,000 tons, and this figure had now been reduced to 175,000 tons.(2) The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s general view was that toHallow milk for children through the blockadewould probably, in the long run, help to sustain morale;but he felt that it was difficult to make a concession forunoccupied France and not to make a similar concession to Belgium and Greece, where food conditions were asbad, if not worse.(3) The Minister of Economic Warfare deprecated thesuggestion that the American proposal to allow throughthe blockade supplies of milk for children inunoccupied France should be linked up with the widerquestion of food supplies to the people of the occupiedthe Turks to take over their interests in the occupied areas. Wehad protested against this, but, if the German Legation were removed, there was a risk that we should find ourselves in constantdispute with the Turks over German interests.The Secretary of State for the Colonies asked the Foreign Officeto consider making a request to the Persian Government that the mufti should be handed over to us.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
territories. To allow any food to enter occupied terri-tories was inconsistent with the basic principle that theGermans were responsible for feeding the people of thecountries which they had overrun. Further, there was reason to believe that the Germans would never allow the United States Branch of the Red Cross to operate in occupied territories, and it was undesirable that our reply to the United States should make reference to acondition which we (and they, too, probably) knew couldnot be fulfilled.(4) The Minister&quot; of Economic Warfare reminded the WarCabinet that, although this matter had been raised sometime ago by the United States, all that they had donehad, in fact, been to send two ships to unoccupied france in March and April, last. He did not think that weshould concede more than to allow an occasional ship toproceed to unoccupied France.The War Cabinet-Instructed the Permanent Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to send a reply, emphasising on thelines brought out in discussion the difficulties of making any concession. The reply should conclude by indicating that we would not object to the admission through theblockade of a very occasional shipload, containing suppliesof milk for children in unoccupied France, to be distri-buted under proper supervision. The reply should not linkup this concession with the position in enemy-occupied territories.The War Cabinet approved the proposals contained in andum by the Home Secretary (W.P*. (G) (41) 84), namely : That a Bill should be introduced to extend the duration ofthe present Parliament for a further year.That the assurance given in the Debates on the Bill of 1940might be repeated, to the effect that an opportunitywould be given for discussion of questions connectedwith changes in our electoral system before a GeneralElection took place. ...Parliament. 10.Bill to extend   MemoraiDuration of thepresentParliament.(previous reference:W,M.

The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary (W.P. (G) (41) 83), towhich was attached a revised draft of a Bill for conferring british nationality on certain classes of French citizens.The Home Secretary said that he was not enthusiastic aboutthe proposed Bill, but that, in view of the assurances given, therewas no doubt that action on the lines proposed would have to betaken in due course.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that, as there was no strong pressure for the bill at the present time; its consideration should be deferred for the present.Great George Street, S.W. 1,September 1, 1941.

PERSONAL SECRET AND PRIVATE

I ought to tell you that there has been a wave of depression through Cabinet and other informed circles here about President&apos;s many assurances about no commitments and no closer to war etc. I fear this will be reflected in Parliament. If 1941 opens with Russia knocked out and Britain left again alone, all kinds of dangers may arise. I do not think Hitler will help in any way. Tonight he has 30 ?-boats in line from the eastern part of Iceland to northern tip of Ireland. We have lost 25,000 tons yesterday 27th and today 28th, but he keeps clear of 26th meridian. You will know best whether anything more can be done. Should be grateful if you could give me any sort of hope. Persia was okay. K? regards. WSC. 28.8.41
