Naval, Militaryand Air rOperations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 77thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.;ave the following information inloom Records Nos. 702-704: 1.   The Chiefs of Staffamplification of Cabinet WarSummary of aircraft losses since&quot; the 4th August: Home Theatre Enemy 6 destroyed.2 probable.2 damaged.Our Own 4 Fighters.22 Bombers.2 Coastal Command.Overseas Theatre Enemy 15 destroyed (11 on the ground).7 probable.13 damaged.Our Own 1 destroyed.During the previous three days our aircraft had hit three enemy merchant vessels and three reporting vessels in Home waters and two merchant vessels and one schooner in Oversea waters.Naval During the previous three days 20,000 tons of shipping had operations.       been lost.   This figure included four ships sunk in a Sierra LeoneShipping Losses, convoy which had been attacked by about ten U-boats, of which itwas hoped that we had sunk two and possibly three.The Tirpitz had been located at Kiel on the previous night.It was feared that six ships (totalling 8,700 tons) out of sevenships carrying coal which had been driven ashore owing to heavyweather on the Norfolk coast on the previous day would prove to betotal losses.A sharp encounter had taken place with the enemy on the3rd August, in which German identifications had been obtained,and heavy losses had been inflicted. There had been continuedindications that the Germans and Italians in the Tobruk area were suffering from acute shortages (due to distribution difficulties) of bombs and aviation spirit.There had been no marked change on the Russian front. the threat towards Odessa had developed and the railway runnirignorth-east from that city was now threatened.A letter had been received from General MacFarlane, who hadnot yet been allowed to visit the front, but had reported the infor-mation given to him by M. Stalin, whom he had seen. GeneralMacFarlane had gained the impression that the battles now inprogress were on a tremendous scale, that the Russians were fighting extremely well, and that the Germans had made little progress on most of the fronts during the past week, with theexception of the Odessa thrust. Stalin had seemed quite confidentof being able to hold up the German attacks this autumn withoutlosing Leningrad, Moscow or Kiev. A large measure of the Russiansuccess had been due to the fact that the Air Force had beenemployed almost entirely in direct support of the Army, while thetechnical efficiency of the Army had been much greater than hadbeen expected.The. War Cabinet took note of the above statements.MilitaryOperations.Tobruk.U.S.S.R.[22796]
Foreign Affairs.U.S.S.R. andBelgium.Turkish StagTalks.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 73rdConclusion,Minute 2.)Thailand.,, 2- The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave thefollowing information :  gt    , 7&apos;*The representatives of the Russian and Belgian Govern-ments had met that morning at the Foreign Office and had agreed to resume diplomatic relations.It was regrettable that the plans for staff talks with turkey had fallen through. The Foreign Secretary said thathe hoped as much information as possible would be sent to theTurks through the channel of our Service Attaches. He hadbeen pressing the Russians to give some assurances to turkey and gathered (see telegram No. 928 from Moscow) that theymight be disposed to do so.The situation in regard to Thailand gave cause for concern.The War Cabinet agreed that this matter should bediscussed at a Meeting of the Defence Committee(Operations) that afternoon.AerodromeConstruction.3. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries (W.P. (41) 185) and the sites for Future Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (41) 187) on the question of sitesAerodromes.      for future aerodromes.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that the AirMinistry required another 126 aerodromes over and above those under construction. Obviously, the land must be provided, but thequestion was &quot; which land? &quot; At present, although he was entitledto raise objections to sites which meant the loss of valuable agricul-tural land, the final decision as to which sites should be used lay with the Secretary of State for Air. He (the Minister of Agricul-ture) now suggested that, where agreement could not be reached, thematter should be submitted for settlement to a War cabinet minister.The Secretary of State for Air feared that this suggestion would result in delay in the preparation of aerodromes. The AirMinistry was most sympathetic to the demands of agriculture andin a number of cases had examined alternative sites. If we wereto obtain overwhelming air superiority by the autumn of 1942, itwas essential there should be no delay in the selection and prepara-tion of the sites of these 126 aerodromes which were required.The Secretary of State for Scotland instanced a case in whichthe Ministry of Aircraft Production was alleged to have requisi-tioned agricultural land without due notice. He was taking thematter up with the Minister of Aircraft Production.After some discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows :  (a) A representative of the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries should be invited to take part in the pre-liminary inspection of aerodrome sites.(b) The Secretary of State for Air was invited to considerwhether a representative of the Ministry of Agriculture:. and Fisheries could^be^made a member of the Aerodrome; 0     Board.(c) The procedure under (a) and (6), by ensuring the associa-tion of a representative of the Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries in the selection of sites at an early stage,should save time and should go far to ensure a satis-factory settlement of these questions. If, however,difficulties were still encountered, the matter should again be brought before the War Cabinet, and furtherconsideration would be given to the suggestion that
difficulties which could, not be settled by discussion between the two Ministers concerned should be referredto a War Cabinet Minister.(d) The procedure followed by the Ministry of Aircraft Pro-duction in acquiring agricultural land for aerodromesites should also be modified so as to include provisions on the lines of (a) and (&amp;) above.(e) In Scotland similar arrangements should be made with theDepartment of Agriculture for Scotland.Japan.BunkeringFacilities forJapanese Ships.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 73rdConclusions,Minute 4.)4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of War Transport(W.P. (G) (41) 73).   This Memorandum set out the facilities atpresent afforded for bunkering Japanese ships, and dealt with thesuggestion that such facilities should be denied altogether.The War Cabinet-Approved the recommendations in the Memorandum,namely, that (a) Restrictions on bunkers for Japanese ships should not proceed beyond those already in force until it was known whether the United States Government wereprepared to impose control on supplies by UnitedStates Companies.(&amp;) Complete denial of bunkers to all Japanese ships should only be instituted in pursuance of a policyof &apos;&apos; parallel action&apos;&apos; with the United States tomeet some new development.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (G) (41) 74) recommending that subject to the requirements of the work and to fresh emergen-cies Departments should be authorised to grant a further week&apos;sleave to their staffs (making two weeks in all) before the winter.The view was generally expressed that the adoption of thisproposal was in the public interest. Attention was drawn to thetendency of sickness rates to rise, more particularly among womenstaffs, and to the strain under which many Civil Servants were working.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, if a second week&apos;sleave was granted to Civil Servants employed in munition factories,including, for example, certain inspectorial staffs, this might giverise to difficulties in respect of the work-people and staffs employedin such factories.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal that Departments should beauthorised to grant to Civil Servants a further week&apos;sleave, making two weeks in all, before the winter, subjectto further consideration being given by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, in consultation with the Supply Ministers,to the question referred to at &quot; X.&quot;U.S.S.R. 6.   The Paymaster-General, as Chairman of the Committee for supplies from the Co-ordination of Allied Supplies, informed the War cabinet united States of of the recent developments in this matter. The main point at issueAmerica. was a proposal to constitute a Committee of Three in WashingtonProposed to deal with Russian requirements.   The details of this proposalCommittee of were set out in telegrams Nos. 3610, 3668 and 3669 from three in Washington.  It was proposed that the Committee should consistWashington.      of Mr. Hopkins (or, in his absence, General Burns), M: Oumansky,the Russian Ambassador in Washington, and Mr. Purvis, on behalfof this country.Holidays.Civil ServiceLeave.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 32ndConclusions,Minute 6.)
Our objections to this procedure had been notified to our ambassador at Washington.*A first meeting of the Committee had been held, attended byM. Oumansky, General Burns and M. Monnet (in Mr. Purvis&apos;sabsence), at which M. Monnet had pointed out very forcibly theobjections to the procedure proposed.On the other hand, it was suggested that there was the risk that, unless we agreed to the proposed Committee of Three, aircraft might be allocated to the Russians by the United States authoritieswithout consultation with us.The Paymaster-General handed round a draft telegram toLord Halifax. This took the line that, while we would with drawour opposition to the Committee of Three, as it was already at work,we could not empower our representative to agree to decisions whichentailed reductions of deliveries from the United States to our own forces except after reference to London.In discussion, strong objection was taken to the proposed plan for a Committee of Three in Washington, on the following grounds : (1) To set up a Committee and give them particulars of theorders which we had placed in the United States would only invite the Russians to put in claims to aircraft which we had ourselves ordered many months ago andhad in many cases already paid for.(2) The diversion to the Russians of aircraft on order by thiscountry would be a crippling blow to the R.A.F.(3) There was no reason to give the Russians particulars ofUnited States production unless they gave corres-ponding information from their side.(4) If it was necessary to set up such a Committee in washington, the Heads of the three British ServiceMissions should be empowered to attend it.(5) It was wrong to agree to set up a Committee and decide onits functions afterwards.(6) There was no clear evidence that President Roosevelt waskeen on the establishment of the proposed Committee.The War Cabinet-(i) Invited the Paymaster-General to prepare a revised draftof the telegram to Lord Halifax, in the light of thediscussion. The revised draft should make it clear thatthe War Cabinet had not assented to the establishmentof the Committee, and could not do so without consider-able further information as to how the Committee wouldfunction.(ii) Agreed that the telegram should also summarise, for lord halifax&apos;s information, the objections to the proposal,and should point out that it was undesirable to reach any final settlement of this matter in the absence from washington of Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Purvis.* Telegram No. 873 to Moscow,, repeated to Washington as telegram No. 4212.Home Defence,PreparednessagainstInvasion.(Previous.reference:W.M. (41) 65thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Lord Privy Seal reminded the War Cabinet that atthe meeting on the 4th July instructions had been given, that &quot; allpur defences were to be brought to the very highest state of anti-mvasion efficiency by the 1st September.&quot;. TM Chiefs of Staff, had now reported to the Prime Ministertnatthe chances of any attempt at. invasion in a. month&apos;s- time wereremptf. They had pointed put that, while there should be no relaxation-;fripn Otpur preparations fop defence, unless the existing instructionsere somewhat modified Departments might begin to take action
which was not justified, and which might have an adverse effect onour war effort. (For example, it had been contemplated that theoverhauling and refitting of warships should be postponed inorder that the maximum forces should be available from the1st September onwards.)The Chiefs of Staff had therefore recommended that theDefence and other Services should be informed that they might expect, from now on, to receive one month&apos;s notice of impendinginvasion. It followed that any anti-invasion measure which couldbe carried out in a month, but which might tend to impair our war effort in other ways,, should not be proceeded with until this one month&apos;s warning had been given.The Lord Privy Seal said that confidential instructions in this sense had already been issued to the Defence Departments, and thePrime Minister had directed that the decision should also bebrought to the notice of Ministers in charge of Civil Departments,who should be asked to take parallel action.The War Cabinet-Invited all Ministers to bring this instruction to the noticeof those concerned.Great George Street, S. W. 1,August 7, 1941.
