Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 98thConclusions,Minute 2.)American helpin convoys.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 94thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Secretary of State for Air said that our bombing operations on Stettin on the night of the 29th/30th September were reported as having been very accurate.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that two ships in outward-bound convoys had been torpedoed in the North Atlantic.He had had an opportunity of speaking on the previous day with the Commodore of the first convoy which had come over witha United States escort. A very favourable impression had beenreceived of the escorfs work. He was proposing to send a shorttelegram to Colonel Knox.The War Cabinet approved this proposal.Palestine. 2.   The Prime Minister said that two Papers had been preparedGeneral Policy   for circulation to the War Cabinet dealing with and Eecruitment . .   T     . . - ,. ..of Jewish Units.        (a) Jewisl? policy generally.(previous ^ Recruitment of Jewish Units for General Service in thei *previous British Army.Reference: JW.M. (40) 269th These papers raised difficult issues, which might involve fairlyConclusions, lengthy consideration. The Papers would be circulated to the WarMinute 5.)        Cabinet and a date fixed for discussion.In the course of preliminary discussion, the following points were made : (1) The Prime Minister said that, if this country and theUnited States emerged victorious from the war, thecreation of a great Jewish State in Palestine would inevitably be one of the matters to be discussed at thePeace Conference.(2) The Colonial Secretary said that Dr. Weizmann, and othermembers of the Zionist organisation, were makingincreasingly large claims as to the possibilities of jewish immigration after the war. Dr. Weizmanh had recentlysuggested that at least 3 million Jews should be absorbedcomparatively quickly into Palestine. This was impracticable, and he thought that the time had come when we should say something to prevent our silencebeing taken as evidence of assent to these increasingclaims.(3) The Prime Minister was disposed to doubt the need for apublic reply to these claims, but thought that perhaps aprivate warning might be given.(4) The Minister of Labour and National Service said that, ifan autonomous Jewish State could be set up, the questionof regulating the flow of immigration thereto would bea matter to be settled,by the authorities of that State.This would greatly ease our difficulties in the matter.No decision was recorded, and the War Cabinet deferreddiscussion to a later date.U.S.S.R. 3.   The attention of Jhe War Cabinet was drawn to telegramsWithdrawal of Nos. Il70fl214?and 122rfrom Sir Stafford Cripps referring to thecertain members Russian request that three members of our military mission should of the Military be withdrawn owing to indiscreet Conversation in an anti-SovietMission. vein.[22982] b 271   CffasA ad^&amp;L**Af.
The Prime Minister said, that it was most&apos; undesirable that-members of our missions should talk politics in Russia. He thought,that we should tell the Russian Government that the withdrawal ofthree officers had been requested, but that, as no charges had been. ,, j formulated against them, it was therefore impossible for us to make&apos; any enquiry. It should be added that in this instance we wereprepared to withdraw the three officers, but that in any future cases that might arise definite charges must be made so that they could be investigated.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty to draft a reply on the linesof &quot; A &quot; above, for submission to the Prime Minister.U.S.S.R.Proposed Dele-gation from theTrade UnionCongress.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 95thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet that theT.U.C. Delegation had been asked to postpone their visit to Russiaso as to avoid clashing with the Moscow Conference. Now that theConference was almost at its close, there was no objection to theT.U.C. Delegation leaving forthwith. Meantime, however, a report had been received from the pilot of the last Catalina which had done the journey by air, stressing the dangers of the air journey owingto weather conditions. We had undertaken to provide means toenable the Delegation to visit Russia, whether by air or by sea. Hethought that the Secretary of State for Air should consider thematter and decide whether the risks of the air journey were such asshould be accepted, and should then see Sir Walter Citrine and inform him of his conclusion. He (the Prime Minister) was disposed to deprecate the party going by air. If a decision was reachedagainst the party going by air, it would then be for the First Lordof the Admiralty to consider what arrangements could be made forthe journey in a Naval vessel for example, in a destroyer.The War Cabinet-iInvited the Secretary of State for Air and the First Lordof the Admiralty to proceed on the lines proposed by thePrime Minister at &quot; X.&quot;United States of 5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was aAmerica. strong feeling in Washington that the size and composition of ourPersonnel of numerous Missions in the United States needed urgent examina-Rritish Missions. tion. Lord Halifax had spoken to him on this question andMr. Morgenthau had drawn attention to the high cost of theMissions that fell on our slender dollar resources which we were asking the Americans to build up. In his (the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s) view, the staffs needed overhauling in the interests of efficiency as well as of economy, and he proposed that Sir WilliamDouglas should proceed at once to Washington to consult with the heads of our various Missions in the United States, with a view to making such adjustments as might be found desirable.The War Cabinet-Approved this proposal, and recorded the view that everyeffort should be made to reduce the size of our Missions inthe United States by a substantial percentage.
Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 85thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Secretary of State for Home Affairs and the Ministerof Home Security reported that on the night of the 30th&apos; September /1st October a sharp attack by enemy aircraft had been made overTyneside. About 20 aircraft had been engaged in this raid and considerable damage had resulted. The approximate casualties hadbeen 52 killed and 122 seriously injured.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Minister of 7.   The Prime Minister said that the Minister of State wouldState. have started back for Cairo before their next Meeting.   He knew that the visit had been of great advantage and had facilitated thesettlement of a number of important matters. The Minister ofState would take back with him the warmest wishes of all hiscolleagues.Great George Street, S. W. 1,October 2, 1941.

R. 10.40 p.m. 20th September, 1941.0:0:0:0:0IMMEDIATEI handed to Stalin last night Prime Minister&apos;s messagein your telegram No. 1291 for which he expressed thanks.2^   I then gave him memorandum on difficulties experienced by Military Mission in securing co-operation. from Soviet General Staff. Text and full report on the&apos; interview follows by air mail to-morrow.     Memorandumreferred to long delays in arranging meetings, inability of even the highest Soviet officers to decide even the smallestpoint without reference, failure to provide any informationof practical planning value for the forthcoming conferenceand complete lack of reciprocity as regards -operationalinformation and exchange of technical military secrets*It made due allowance for difference in Soviet staff organisation and pre-occupation of Soviet Staff with theconduct of the war, and emphasised that we had never heldout for exchange of information on a bargaining basis.Nevertheless Soviet failure to reciprocate, which seemeddue either to the unwillingness of. individual members ofthe Soviet Staff on technical grounds or to definitepolitical directive, was a very serious matter from the pointof view of our co-operation as. a whole and I was anxiousto ascertain reason before the conference opened.3.   In reply, Stalin assured me that the soviet authorities did desire full co-operation.   Staff in Moscowwas [grp. omitted] reduced to a minimum and greatlyoverworked.    Russian lack of method was also, he admitted,a contributory cause   On the other side of the picture&quot;not all members of the British Military Mission conductedthemselves as they should&apos;1&apos;.   (He mentioned reports which Iam investigating of a British officer at Sebastapol havingspoken in an anti-Soviet vein to Soviet naval officer).General MacFarlane and I intend to get to the bottom ofthis unpleasant accusation which he believes unfounded.4. Again, operational information supplied by theBritish Mission had not always proved reliable.    We hadpredicted that the main German thrust in the north wouldbe somewhere between Leningrad and Moscow and in the southagainst the Crimea with an attempted landing from the sea.Whereas the real concentrations had been against moscow and KieVo   Some Soviet agents in Germany had been found tobe working for both sides and perhaps this was true of ouragents also*   Anyhow, supply of this unreliable information had had adverse effect on Soviet Staff.   General MacFarlaneis/
is sending his&apos; comments by bag.   He does not accept &apos;\Stalin&apos;s criticism.5.   As regards supply of operational intelligenceby the Soviet side, there had been much &quot;reorganisation in  %Germany since the war began and a good deal of their information was believed to be out of date.   their inability for this reason to supply more may&apos;have causeddisappointment..       ,     -6.   As regards exchange of military secrets, Stalinseemed unaware that&apos;.we-&apos;held given any and I undertook tosupply him with list mentioning one in particular that wehad&quot; supplied and one which we had failed to-obtain fromthe Soviet side following repeated requests over a periodof six weeks. .- Stalin asked whether it was proposed to exchange all State secrets:;-so far there was no agreement to do so.-   I told him that I believed that we had alreadydisclosed everything likely to assist&apos; them With theexception of certain -things which we could- not risk falling into enemy hands.    (This point he fully appreciated).With regard, to the particular matter-bn which;,we had pressed for details&apos;, we had been informed; here thatGermans had already found out all about it...&apos;  This,,Stalindenied; . Germans; were not using invention; themselves andwere offering rewards for information&apos; about how it. worked.But he promised to let [grp. omitted ? me];&apos;:have, an answer-m a day or two;   adding that as regards.Germantechnical - developments Soviet authorities had noticednothing of outstanding interest,,        i:  .;    .7.   Stalin-was&apos;somewhat pessimistic, about Americanhelp v/hich, he said,, had so far been .on a very.. small scale.8.   Meeting [grp unuec- ? cordialT but my&apos;Impress ionwas that lack of co-operation was partly due to the factthat. Soviet Staff are still doubtful as to the degree towhich we intend toiielp them and under-estimate what wehave already done0

R0 3,15 a.nu   1st October, 1941.////Confidential.My telegram No. 1170 paragraph 3,As a result of my insistence on knowing which membersof the Military Mission Stalin had in mind, 3 names weregiven me on September 20th.2.   I then said that I must have full particulars of circumstances in which words complained of were spoken.   Tothis I have received reply from Molotov dated September 26thsaying &quot;Soviet Government had and has no intention of con-ducting an enquiry into the activities of these Britishofficersc    By present letter I wish to confirm that SovietGovernment cannot treat these officers with confidence any longer.     It is left.to your discretion to draw the con-clusions hero from that you consider necessary&quot;.3.   I have replied that I cannot possibly make the investigations I had promised, without information askedfor.   As a result of Iolotov!s letter the matter has assumeda most grave aspect and I cannot accept the letter as finalwithout first explaining to him what extremely serious re-percussions will be caused by the attitude which the SovietGovernment has adopted.    Neither I myself nor the military mission nor the British public will be able to understand therinciple on which the officers are virtually turned out of.S.S.R. without grounds given or opportunity of meeting thecharges.    I have added that I shall not discuss the pointwith Molotov until the conclusion of the conference hut thatthis delay which is matter of practical convenience in no way detracts from the seriousness of the matter.

VFROM MOSCOW TO FOREIGN OF?I(Sir ?A0?ripps D. 10.59 p..m. 30th September, 1941.No. 1321. r.   2.45 a.m. 1st p6t\ber? 1941.30th September, 1941.IMMEDIATE.SECRET.JJJJJMy telegram No. 1214.As I have to raise this question strongly as soon as theconference is over, and as I am most anxious that it should doas little harm as possible I should be grateful if you would consider the following in conjunction with Chiefs of Staff.2.   Assuming Soviet Government persist in their view andrefuse to alter it, then it will be necessary for me to sendback the 3 officers in question.3.   We could not allow this to pass without a good dealof action on our part and it seems to me and to Admiral Milesthat the only possible and almost inevitable action wouldhave to be the&quot;withdrawal of the Naval Mission in Moscow andfrom the Black Sea, on basis &quot;chat we could not expose them to  &apos;further risk of anonymous accusations and consequent action by soviet Government.4.   This would of course very much endanger our otherrelations and^u-bl-jroly [sic ?off act ] Sweden - and- v/ould be littleshort of disastrous.5.   I cannot approach Molotov straight off with such a threat and if I wait till he has said that the Soviet government cannot alter their opinion then it will be too late to do anything about it.6.   Would it not be possible for you to convey this to theSoviet Ambassador at once so that before I approach Molotov hewill have been warned of the risk and will be able to get outof the situation without undue loss of face?7.   I cannot delay long after the conference is finished butI will await your reply before doing anything further at this end.8.   The reason why I refer to Admiral Miles above is that I now believe that the Second Officer, whose name was spelt in russian character, was intended to be Lieutenant CommanderFawkes and not Captain Fox.   In that case all officers areNaval Officers and the most important have been at Sebastapol.
