-The War Cabinet had before them Telegrams Nos. 753, 754,755 and 756&apos;ffrom Sir Stafford Cripps at Moscow.The main point in these telegrams was that Sir Stafford Crippshad seen M. Stalin, who had thanked him for the Prime Minister&apos;personal message/&quot;and had broached the question of the conclusionof an agreement between this country and the U.S.S.R., under twoheads: &apos;(1) Mutual help, without any precision as to quantity orquality.(2) Neither country concluding a separate peace.It was generally agreed that it was most important that this advance should meet with an immediate and generous response.Discussion turned mainly on the question of form. Should weconfine ourselves to an exchange of Notes? Should there be aDeclaration or Agreement? or should there be a formal Treaty of mutual Assistance ?General agreement was expressed with the view that an exchange of Notes was not adequate. On the other hand, the signature of a Treaty might have a somewhat unfavourable reactionon public opinion in certain countries. M. Stalin had not asked fora Treaty, but for an Agreement. In substance an agreed Declara-tion was as binding as a Treaty.The Foreign Secretary said that he had had a preliminary discussion with Mr. Winant on the subject, and the latter had expressed the personal opinion that, if an exchange of Notes wasconsidered to be not enough, a Declaration would be preferable toa Treaty, from the United States point of view.The War Cabinet agreed that it would be desirable that theimmediate response should take the form of a message from thePrime Minister to M. Stalin.Some discussion followed as to whether the Prime Ministersmessage should include any reference to the settlement of frontiersat the Peace Conference, and the right of the ethnographical unitsthen established to choose their own form of government and systemof life. After some discussion, in which it was pointed out thatthis might make difficulties for the Poles in their negotiations withthe Russians, it was generally felt that the wisest course would beto limit the answer to the two points covered by M. Stalin&apos;s proposal.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a message from the Prime Minister to M. Stalinshould be despatched forthwith.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toarrange for the Dominions to be consulted in regard tothe proposed agreed Declaration.(3) Agreed that, pending the receipt of the reply from theDominion Governments, the text of the agreed Declara-tion should not be communicated to M. Stalin, but shouldbe sent to Sir Stafford Cripps for his information.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Polish Govern-ment of the position at an appropriate moment, but not too far in advance of publication.The text of the Prime Ministers message to M. Stalin and ofthe proposed agreed declaration are contained in the telegram toHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, annexed to these Minutes.Great George Street, S*W, 1,July 9, 1941.U.S.S.R.(PreviousUef erence:W.M.

Stalin :-&quot; Ambassador Cripps having reported his talk with you and havingstated the terms of a proposed Anglo-Russian agreed declaration under twoheads, namely: &quot; (1) Mutual help without any precision as to quantity or quality; and&quot; (2) Neither country to conclude a separate peace,I have immediately convened the War Cabinet, including Mr. Fraser,Prime Minister of the Dominion of New Zealand, who is with us now. Itwill be necessary for us to consult with the Dominions of Canada, Australiaand South Africa, but in the meanwhile I should like to assure you that weare wholly in favour of the agreed declaration you propose. We think itshould be signed as soon as we have heard from the Dominions and publishedto the world immediately thereafter.&quot;2. For your own information, what we have in mind is declaration in following terms : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Govern-ment of the U.S.S.R. have agreed and declare as follows :-&quot; (1) The two Governments mutually undertake to render each other assistance of all kinds in the present war against Germany.&apos;&apos; (2) They further undertake that during this war they will neithernegotiate nor conclude an armistice or treaty of peace except by mutual agreement.&quot;3. As Dominion Governments have to be consulted, you should not yetcommunicate actual text to Stalin. But it will help to show you what we meanand to give him any explanations he may require.f4.

MOST SECRET.Your telegram No. 74 L.I delivered message personally to Stalin at 1.50 to-day. he saw me alone, without Molotov, in his own room.   We talked for an hour.   He expressed his thanks for message and when I explainedits very confidential nature he remarked humorously he hoped itwould not get out through some press man in London, I hope sotoo.   He stated he would send reply.2.     He then broached the question of some agreement betweenthe two countries, without which in his opinion co-operation wasnot possible.   It was necessary to clarify the position and tocreate a basis for our joint effort.   He stressed this point very strongly.5.     I repeated to him what I had said to Molotov (see my telegram. No. Qn5 Noveiriber 19th paragraphs 2 and 5) and then asked him what sort of an agreement he had in mind.-4.heads:He stated one of a purely general nature under two(1)   Mutual help without any precision as to quantity orquality,(2)   Neither country to conclude a separate peace.He said, without this, Russia felt isolated in view of all theagreements which Germany had against her, and he thought thatwould be most valuable for the morale both of U.S.S.R, and ofGreat Britain.5.     I told him I had misunderstood Molotov1s request as i thought he had intended something much more specific as regardsour political interests vis-a-vis other countries. I pointed out to him that though His Majesty&apos;s Government were wholly deter-mined upon both these points it was not necessarily easy oradvisable to reduce them to a formal agreement at this early stage.   Both in Great Britain and in America there were stillelements of public opinion which needed converting to this idea.6.     I suggested that there might possibly be an exchangeOf......
2. ii of notes on this basis and that I would recommend this tomy Government.   He said that in his - opinion an agreement would he much more valuable&quot;, &quot;hilt such an exchange of noteswould he something.7.     He asked, if convenient to His Majesty&apos;s Government,   Inegotiations should he carried Dut in Moscow, if they tookplace.8.    My own very strong recommendation is that we should-seize this opportunity without any delay in order to hind the-Russians to continuing their resistance.   I can see no possibledrawback to our stating our determination to do so and a verygreat advantage in getting them publicly committed before theirown people and world.9.     I should personally prefer an agreement in form.But if you consider this for any reason inadvisable, then Ithink a formal exchange of notes would be sufficiently satis-factory, though it lacks - a little in its impact on world opinion. &apos; .10,,    : Perhaps the two ideas could be combined in animmediate exchange of notes with an understanding that thesubstance would later be reduced -to the form of an agreement,See my immediately following telegram,,
 This telegram is of particular secrecy and should &quot;beretained by the authorised recipient and not passed on].IMMEDIATE. /Molotov sent for me tonight to question ine afterconsultation with Stalin in order to clarify the attitudeof His Majesty&apos;s Government.He wanted to know:(1) Pegree of co-operation which we proposed.(2) Whether it included political co-operation.(3) Whether we were prepared to conclude a political agreement to define the basis of co-operation.This third point was obviously the really important one so far as the Soviet Government were concerned andexplains his desire, expressed this morning, to limitpublicity.I told him(1) Economic - the maximum possible in view of limited meansof transport.    Militarily - advice and technical help.But we had no men or materials to spare.(2) This was highly desirable in the Middle East and far east and our common aim should be to keep Germans and anyof their Axis partners out.(3) We did not contemplate any political agreement at thisstage.     We suggested that political basis was the commonenmity against Hitler but while this was sound basis formilitary and economic co-operation it was not a satisfactory basis for a political agreement.     Our new relations had only existed since last Sunday and it was better to wait[?till] we had learnt to trust each other over a period ofmilitary and economic co-operation before trying to putour political relations into the form of a writtenagreement..    I hoped that this would follow at a future date probably at Peace Conference if we were victorious.Molotov said  he would report to his Government and let meknow in the morning.I propose to remain completely firm on this subject andshall insist on co-operation without any political agreementsI told him that we were not like Hitler who entered into agreements only to break them when convenient.     I also asked him how the war was proceeding.    He explained that itwas early days and that though Soviet military authorities[Cypher]WAR CABINET DISTRIBUTION.FROM SOVIET UNION.FROM MOSCOW TO FOREIGN OFFICE.D. 12.50p\ .2a^June, 19V1R.   5.50 p.m^?Bth June, 194-1Sir S.

He asked me what I suggested.2.   I told him that we were aware of these dangersand had already made representations in Tehran about them.But I thought a concerted demarche by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and Soviet Government might have some effect.With this he agreed.     I told him that this would have tobe arranged by you in London but I would ask you to do something along these lines if you thought it possible,,concerting it with the Soviet Ambassador, to whom he issending instructions.3.   I said I was without information as to thesituation in Afghanistan, but no doubt you would check upon this and see if our information coincided with theirs,in which case you would perhaps take similar joint actionin Kabul.4.   He stated that no doubt the Shah, whose,unpopularity he appreciated, would attempt to play eachof us off against the Germans and that therefore some form of combined action was necessary.     He thought therewas now a chance of such action succeeding but that if theoccasion&quot; were missed the chances would be much less favourable later.See my immediately following telegram.

We are all very glad here the russian armies are making such strong and spirited resistance to theutterly unprovoked and merciless invasion of the Nazis.   Thereis general admiration of the bravery and tenacity of thesoldiers and people.   We shall do everything to help you thattime, geography and our growing resources allow.    The longerthe war lasts the more help we can give.   We are making very heavy attacks both by day and night with our Air Force upon all German occupied territory and all Germany within ourreach.    About 400 daylight sorties were made overseasyesterday.    On Saturday night over 200 heavy bombers attackedGerman towns, some carrying three tons apiece, and last night nearly 250 heavy bombers were operating.    This will goon.   Thus we hope to force Hitler to &quot;bring hack some of hisAir power to the West and gradually take some of the strainoff you.    Besides this the Admiralty have at my desireprepared a serious operation to come off in the near future in the Arctic, after which I hope contact will be estahlishedbetween British and Russian Navies.    Meanwhile by sweepsalong the Norwegian coast we have intercepted various supplyships which were moving north against you.We welcome arrival of Russian Military Mission inorder to concert future plans.We have only got to go on figting to heat the lifeout of these villains.

On the other hand an exchangeof notes as you suggest would be inappropriate and inadequateas a method of recording what is a decision of high policy,I should prefer a joint and formal declaration by the twoGovernments,     It was this method that we employed with theFrench when agreeing in March 1940 not to make a separate peace (absit omen).If as the result of Stalin&apos;s reception *of PrimeMinister&apos;s messaged you have any fresh suggestion to make asto form of our understanding please inform me immediately.
