(G) (41) 96) pointing out thatthe pits. miners returning to the pits would, at the end of September, still(Previous fall short by 5,000 of the 720,000 men required to meet the needsReference:       of war-time consumption.W.M. (41) 75th The Lord Presidents Committee had come to the conclusionConclusions, that it was necessary that the full 720,000 should be made availableMinute 12.) by the middle of October. In order to attain this aim, they were satisfied that there must be some modification of the limitationshitherto placed on the withdrawal of men from industry. Whileit was not proposed to withdraw fully-skilled men from the excluded industries unless the Supply Department concerned had agreed and arrangements had been made for replacement, they recommended that men engaged in unskilled or semi-skilled work inany of the excluded industries should be made available forimmediate withdrawal without consultation, on the understandingthat the Minister of Labour and National Service would do his utmost to replace such men as quickly as possible, and that, whereconsiderable numbers were employed in one establishment, theywould be withdrawn gradually.The Lord President of the Council said that, while the numbersconcerned were not large, his Committee was satisfied that, if wewere to get through the winter without serious trouble, it would benecessary to recruit up to the figure of man-power now proposed.The President of the Board of Trade explained that the coal production Council had asked for 50,000 men to be returned to theindustry, but had abated their demand to 30,000. The numberproposed represented the absolute minimum. Moreover, it was essential that the full number should be returned not later than themiddle of October.The Minister of Supply expressed his grave reluctance to any arrangement whereby men were taken away from establishmentsworking for the Ministry of Supply without prior consultation.He instanced a number of establishments, engaged on vitalmunitions production, where the withdrawal of miners woulddislocate the production of essential munitions.The First Lord of the Admiralty also attached greatimportance to consultation before men were taken.After further discussion,. the War Cabinet agreed asfollows : *(1) In principle; the proposals in the Lord Presidents paper were accepted, on the understanding that the Ministerof Labour and National Service would take steps to, ensure that the power to withdraw men was not exercisedharshly or without discrimination.at the present time would add nothing to the Prime Minister&apos;broadcast statement of the 24th August, and might even detractfrom its force.The War Cabinet-Accepted the policy recommended in this Paper. It was,however, important that the United States Governmentshould be given no grounds for thinking that we had not taken action in this matter fully corresponding to theirown. The communication to the United States Govern-ment might therefore take the form of saying that, if they thought that we could usefully make any further state-ment, we would do so; but that, in our own judgment, itwas undesirable to add anything at this stage to the PrimeMinisters broadcast.
(2) Any Minister aggrieved by the exercise of these powers would, of course, have the right of appeal to the WarCabinet, or to such other authority as might be deter-mined for hearing appeals.(3) In cases where appeals were made, withdrawal should be deferred for a week, to enable the appeal to be heard.(4) The Secretary of State for War was instructed to take steps to ascertain that there were no miners employedin occupations in the Army which would lend colour tothe suggestion that the attitude of the Government tothe release of men for the colours was unreasonable.Great George Street, S.W.1,September 18, 1941.
PRIME MINISTER&apos;S PERSONAL TELEGRAM 

SERIAL No T591

PRIME MINISTER CHURCHILL TO PRIME MINISTER STALIN

Personal and Secret 18.9.41

Many thanks for your message. The Harriman Mission has all arrived and is working all day long with Beaverbrook and his colleagues. The object is to survey the whole field of resources so as to be able to work out with you a definite programme of monthly delivery by every available route and thus help repair so far as possible losses of your munition industries. President Roosevelt&apos;s idea is that this first plan should cover up till the end of June but naturally we shall go on with you till victory. I hope the Conference may open in Moscow 25th of this month, but no publicity should be given till all are safely gathered. The routes and method of travel wiil be signalled later

2. I attach great importance to opening the
 through route from Persian Gulf to Caspian, not only by railway but by a great motor road, in the making of which we hope to enlist American energies and organisation. Lord Beaverbrook will be able to explain the whole scheme of supply and transportation; he is on the closest terms of friendship with Harriman.

3. All possible theatres in which we might effect military cooperation with you have been examined by the Staffs. The two flanks, North and South, certainly present the  most favourable opportunities. If we could act successfully in Norway the attitude of Sweden would be powerfully affected but at the moment we have neither the forces nor the shipping available for this project. Again in the south the great prize is Turkey; if Turkey can be gained another powerful army will be available. Turkey would like to come with us but is afraid, not without reason. It may be that the promise of considerable British forces and supplies of


technical material in which the Turks are deficientwill exercise a decisive influence upon them.    we will study with you any other form of useful aid,the sole object being to bring the maximum force against the common enemy.4. I entirely agree that the first source fromwhich the Russian fleet should be replenished shouldbe at the expense of Germany.    Victory will certainlygive us control of important German and  Italian naval vessels and in our view these would be most suitablefor repairing losses to the Russian fleet.
