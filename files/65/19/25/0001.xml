The Chiefs of Staff gave,the following information in amplification of, Cabinet War Room Records Nos, 7.30-732.Summary of aircraft losses since the 1st September: Home Theatre-Enemy-5 destroyed.1 damaged.Our own 1 Fighter.13 Bombers;3 Coastal Command Aircraft.On the night of the 2nd September we had lost 16 aircraft,returning from successful raids over Berlin and Frankfort, throughcrash landing due to fog, but the crews of 14 machines were safe.Overseas losses had been On a small scale.An optimistic report (Which should perhaps be treated withsome reserve) had been received from Moscow. A Russian Colonelhad said that the output of new Soviet aircraft and of trainedcrews was considerably in excess of losses from all causes.In answer to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff said thatour bombing policy at present was to devote most of our effort toattacks on targets in Germany &quot;which were centres both of communi-cations and of industry; and, when the weather was suitable, to bomb Berlin. The bombing of oil targets had been suspendedpending further consideration.No shipping losses had been reported during the last three days.   One ship of 1,000 tons had been damaged at Alexandria.On the 2nd/3rd September .Swordfish aircraft from Malta had attacked a south-bound convoy under escort. One enemy vessel of9,000 tons had been blown up, a second of 9,000 tons had been damaged and two other vessels had been hit.There had been little change on the Russian Front during thelast three days. No information had been received to confirm the accounts in the Press of strong Russian counter-attacks in theSmolensk and Gomel sectors. The whole of Estonia, with theexception of the islands of Dago and Oesel, were in German hands.Leningrad was almost encircled and cut off from Moscow. In theSmolensk sector the Germans had made no further progress towardsMoscow. The German thrust south-east from Gomel had made further progress. The last direct railway line connecting KievWith the east ahd north-east was now threatened. In the Ukrainesector the Germans were fighting hard to widen the bridgeheadover the Dnieper at Dniepropetrowsk, and the bridgehead atKremenschug was in their hands. ; There had been indications of preparations in Bulgaria for combined operations.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Persia. 2.

atlantic charter.interpretation of Point III.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 84thConclusions,Minute 1.)Royal Navy.Revision ofSubmarineProgramme.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 43rdConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (41) 200) proposing a revisionof the submarine programme as follows : &apos; - - .1940 and 1941 sup-supplementary   Pro-gramme ...      Revised Programmenow proposed  ...s.Class.3022T.Class.2730u.Class.1224Mine-layers..   ,5..Total.74None    763. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theSecretary of State for India and Burma, and by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (W.P. (G.) (41) 85 and 89) about Point iii of the Atlantic Charter. This Point had been fastened on by theBurman Ministers as an argument for a promise of full self-government immediately after the war. The Governor-General ofIndia was also anxious as to the meaning which would be given toit by Indian politicians.The Secretary of State for India and Burma had thereforesubmitted a draft statement to make it clear that the atlantic charter was a general affirmation of the principles for which wewere waging the present war, and that it in no way modified the declarations already made as to Constitutional advance in Indiaand Burma.The Secretary of State for the Colonies, in his Memorandum,pointed out that we could not admit the right of unfetterred choiceto those who, in the words of the League of Nations Covenant, were&apos;&apos; not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditionsof the modern world.&quot;The Secretary of State for India handed round a telegram fromthe Viceroy, dated the 3rd September (No. 2151 S), commenting onthe second paragraph of the formula proposed in W.P. (G) (41) 85,and also handed round two amendments to the formula in his paper.The Secretary of State for the Colonies expressed doubts as tothe wisdom of using the words &quot; development of self-governing institutions.&quot; Unless this phrase was qualified, he feared that itmight be interpreted as meaning self-government in the full sensewithout any qualification, i.e., something in the nature of dominion status.The view generally expressed in discussion was that it was clear that the Atlantic Charter, being a document agreed betweenthe Prime Minister and President Roosevelt, was directed to thenations of Europe whom we hoped to free from Nazi tyranny, andwas not intended to deal with the internal affairs of the BritishEmpire, or with relations between the United States and, forexample, the Philippines. It was also clear that one party to theagreement could not issue an authoritative interpretation orexplanation of the Charter. The Prime Minister could, however,properly deal with the matter in an exclusive sense, i.e., by making clear to what Point III of the Declaration did not refer.The Prime Minister said that a Parliamentary Question onthis matter had been addressed to him for answer on the first dayof the Session. He thought that the best plan would be that heshould draft a somewhat shorter statement, on the lines of the draftby the Secretary^ of State for India and Burma, which he could usein reply to this question. He would submit this draft to the WarCabinet at their Meeting on the following Monday.The War Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to proceed accordingly.
The effect of the revised programme would be to lay down two more submarines than were contemplated in the original pro-grammes. Moreover, by increasing the proportion of smaller andmore easily constructed vessels, we should in many cases obtainearlier delivery, varying between three and twelve months.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal in W.P. (41) 200.The War Cabinet Approved the proposal of the Lord President of theCouncil (set out in W.P. (G) (41) 87) that; the existingFire Prevention Executive should be dissolved as soon asthe new National Advisory Council for Fire Prevention,under the Chairmanship of the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security, could be set up.Civil Defence.Proposeddissolutionof FirePreventionExecutive.(previous reference:W.M. (40) &apos;311thConclusions, ----Minute 3.)Mr. Mackenzie 6.   The Prime Minister said that this was the last meeting ofKin - the War Cabinet which Mr. Mackenzie King would attend on this(Previous visit. They all regretted that circumstances had made it impossibleReference: for.Mr. Mackenzie King to make a long stay in this country. TheW.M. (41) 85th War Cabinet had derived great encouragement from his presenceConclusions,      at their deliberations.Minute l.) They realised to the full the magnitude of the effort in man-power, in material and, in financial assistance which Canada was now putting forth. The Canadian effort in the last war had alreadybeen exceeded. It gave them the greatest confidence to know thata statesman of Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s experience and clear visionwas at the helm in Canada.The Prime Minister expressed the hope that Mr. mackenzie king would be able to pay them another visit before long. He stillhoped that it might be possible to bring about a meeting in thiscountry of all four Dominion Prime Ministers.Mr. Mackenzie King thanked the Prime Minister warmly for what he had said. Great Britain could rely on Canada for an ever-increasing war effort. Canada would fight with us to the end. Hewas most grateful to the Prime Minister and his colleagues for all their help. Relations between the two countries could not be morecordial.*ade . 7.   The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that theisputesAet. question of the Trade Disputes Act had been raised at the TradesUnion Congress at Edinburgh. After discussions with variousMinisters concerned, the following inessage had been sent on the2nd September from No. 10 Downing Street to Sir WalterCitrine :-&quot; It is understood question of Trade Disputes Act will be debated to-morrow. Lord President has ^explained to youprovisional vie^: of members of, Government who have been considering this matter. If, however, you. and colleagues feelimpossible await, as suggested, result of appeal.now pending,which may be expected to clagifyj^xis^ing,position, arrange-&apos;ments can be made for explbratdry &apos; discussion of natureproposed by you when &quot;deputiatioh waited on Prime Minister.On learning numbertof .repre^enj;aiiyes of T.U.G. who will take part, equal number *of representatives of Conservative party will be nominated.&quot;
Trades Unions. 8.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum on thisEefusal of matter by the Lord President of the Council (W.P. (G) (41) 88).Firms on It was explained that difficulties were developing owing to theGovernment refusal of certain firms to accept the recognised practice ofWork to negotiating and discussing labour questions with Trades Unionsnegotiate. representing their workpeople.  These difficulties had become acutein certain cases, in which the firm had maintained its refusal, inspite of recommendations made by courts of enquiry. It was pro-posed that, when difficulties of this kind arose, the Minister shouldcontinue his practice of first trying to reach a settlement by wayof conciliation. If this failed, he would consult the Supply Depart-ment concerned before appointing a court of enquiry. On receiving the court&apos;s findings, he would again consult the Supply department concerned and see whether action to give effect to those findingscould be secured on a voluntary basis. If, however, the two ministers agreed, after consultation, that the findings must been forced compulsorily, a direction would be issued to the firm. Inthe event of disagreement between the two Ministers, the matter would be referred to the Lord Presidents Committee before any direction was issued. The directions would be given on behalf ofthe Government by the Minister of Labour.In discussion, it was urged that to make an Order-in-Councilon the lines proposed at the present moment might give rise to difficulties. Although there was perhaps no direct connection, itwould be thought that there was a connection with the questionsunder discussion about the Trades Disputes Act. It was thereforeurged that action on the lines proposed should be postponed.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the Supply ministers were in agreement with the course proposed, and that the Ministerof Labour and National Service was placed in a most embarrassing position if no action was taken, on recommendations made bycourts of enquiry, by firms to which he was compulsorily directingthe transfer of workpeople who might be members of trades union with which the firms in question refused to negotiate. Itwas also pointed out that the course proposed was intended as awar-time measure only.The view generally expressed was that, if serious difficultiesarose, action would have to be taken on the lines proposed in theMemorandum. Some doubt was expressed, however, as to whetherthe difficulties which had arisen so far were sufficiently serious tomake it necessary to take action at once on the lines proposed;The War Cabinet-Decided to defer consideration of this matter for a week.Great George Street, S.W. 1,September 4,1941.The points which it was desired to discuss related to Sections 5and 6 of the Act, which dealt with the position of Civil servants and the employees of public utility undertakings.It had now been agreed that discussions should take place between seven members of the T.U.C. and seven representatives ofthe Conservative Party. The object of these discussions was to see whether any recommendations could be made to which effect couldbe given without in any way impairing the unity or strength of our war effort.The position of the Liberal Party in this matter was con-sidered. It was agreed that the best plan would be that the liberal party should not take part in these discussions, but should conferseparately, if necessary, with the Trades Union Congress on thematter.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of these arrangements.
