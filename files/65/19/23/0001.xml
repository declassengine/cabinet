Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 86thConclusions,Minute 2.)Air Operations.naval operations.shipping losses.MilitaryOperations.Persia.U.S.S.R.RussianShipping in theBaltic.1. The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 723-725 : Summary of aircraft losses since the 25th August, 1941: Home Theatre -Enemy 14 destroyed.5 probable.8 damaged.Our Own 17 fighters (3 pilots safe).16 bombers (444 sorties made).3 Coastal Command aircraft.Owing to bad weather, eight of our bombers had crashed inthis country on the previous evening, but all the&apos;crews were safe.Overseas Theatre Enemy 10 destroyed.3 probable.7 damaged.Our Own &apos;6 destroyed.During the previous three days our aircraft had hit sevenenemy ships, of which two were claimed to have been sunk.During the previous three days three ships, totalling15,000 tons, had been sunk. These ships had been in the outward-bound Atlantic convoy which had been attacked on the night of the26th/27th August. Details were given of the convoys now on their way to this country, and of the measures taken for their protection.As a result of attacks by Hudson aircraft, a U-boat in theNorth Atlantic had surfaced and surrendered; The Prime ministers aid he would discuss with the First Sea Lord later the desirabilityof taking steps to prevent this U-boat being scuttled.No serious opposition had so far met the advance of our forcesin Persia.Attention was drawn to the importance of making contact withthe Russian forces at the earliest possible moment. The PrimeMinister said that he proposed to telegraph to M. Stalin on thispoint.Heavy rain was now hindering the German movements. TheRussians claimed air superiority in the Central Sector; this wasattributed to German petrol difficulties. On the Ukraine front thesituation had deteriorated, and the German thrust south-east fromGomel had now reached the Bryansk-Kiev Railway, thusendangering the Russian forces in the Kiev Sector. In the dnieper bend the Germans had seized the west bank of the river and had established a bridge-head at Dniepropetrovsk. TheGermans claimed some 85,000 prisoners and 475 guns in the Dniepersalient. In Finland the Finns were approaching the MurmanskRailway, and on the Baltic front the Germans claimed to be close to Tallinn. On the Leningrad front the Germans were close toLyuban, some 50 miles south of Leningrad on the Moscow Railway.The Prime Minister said that it was important that theGermans should not obtain Russian ships in the Baltic. It was forconsideration whether we should give the Russians any under-taking in regard to replacement after the war of any shipping(including naval vessels) which they destroyed in order to preventits falling into the hands of the enemy.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements..

Syria. 2.   The Prims  Minister  said  that  General  de  Gaulle&apos;general behaviour in recent weeks had been very disturbing.  He was nowde Gaulle. on his way back to this country, and had made some extraordinary(Previous statements in an interview at Brazzaville, of which a censoredEeference: version had appeared in that morning&apos;s issue of the DailyW.M. (41) 77th Telegraph. If these statements were confirmed, we might have to conclusions,      modify our attitude to General de Gaulle.minute 2.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was invited to circulate the uncensored account of this interview to theWar Cabinet, and the Minister of Information to reportin what form the interview had appeared in the UnitedStates.Policy in Syria. In discussion, it was pointed out that the Free French policyin Syria had been, from some points of view, an embarrassingcommitment. If we could take a new view of the position in Syriawe might be able to reach a general settlement with the arab countries, including a settlement of the Palestine question, whichwould bring us increased support throughout the world.The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary explained thatour policy in this matter was as follows : (1) Our policy in regard to Syria would be guided by thefollowing two principles : (a) Syria for the Syrians;(b) That so far as any European nation had privilegesin Syria, that country would be France.(2) Negotiations in regard to the settlement of Syria would betaken in hand as soon as possible and would not be leftover till the end of the war.(3) The question of asettlement of the Arab question generallyraised far more difficult issues, and it would probablybe premature to attempt to deal with it at the presenttime.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the Jewsshared the opinion that it would be premature to attempt to dealwith these wider issues at the present time, as the Arabs were stillof the opinion that we should not win the war.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Mexico.Proposedagreementbetween british oil companies and mexican government,and resumptionof diplomatic relations.3. The Foreign Secretary reminded the War Cabinet that,when the Mexican Government had torn up the agreements withthe oil companies, we had broken off diplomatic relations withMexico. These relations had never been resumed, largely becausethe oil companies had feared that to do so might induce the Govern-ments of Venezuela and Persia to break the agreements with the oil companies operating in their territories.The United States Government were now pressing theAmerican oil companies to come to an agreement with Mexico. Inthese circumstances, the Foreign Secretary thought that we oughtnow to persuade the British oil companies to come to an agreementwith the Mexican Government on broadly the same terms as thosewhich were negotiated by the American oil companies. We shouldalso aim at resumption of diplomatic relations with Mexico.The War Cabinet approved the course proposed.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad received a telegram from Sir Stafford Cripps (No. 1037)pressing for a decision as to the date on which the Anglo-American-Russian Conference on supplies should be held.The Minister of Supply said that his information from theUnited States was to the effect that the United States authorities would not be ready to hold the Conference before the 15th October.The Prime Minister thought that this was too late. Hesuggested the 30th September.The War Cabinet authorised the Foreign Secretary to reply on the lines that it was for the Americans ratherthan ourselves to fix the date.The Prime Minister said that he had asked the Chiefs of staff to examine the proposal that 200 Hurricane aircraft should be sentto Russia. He would also be glad if they would consider a Russianrequest for engines for E-boats.Persia. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that draft(Previous terms for presentation to the Persian Government had been drawnEeference: up (Telegram No. 575 to Tehran), and that M. Maisky had.W.M. (41) 86th telegraphed these to Moscow asking for the Russian reactions to conclusions,      them at the earliest possible moment.Minute 4.) The next royalty payment by the Anglo-Iranian petroleum company was due at the end of the month, and steps had beentaken to block payments from this country to Persia.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Dominions. 6.   The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs reminded theEepresentation War Cabinet of recent events in Australia. Mr. Menzies had putof Dominion forward a proposal to the Labour Party that a Government shouldGovernments be formed in which the Labour Party would have half the portfolios,in London. and that it should be left to the Australian House of Commons to(Previous choose a Prime Minister.  The Labour Party had turned down thisEeference: proposal, on the ground that the troubles of Mr. Menzies&apos; Govern-W.M. (41) 84th ment were inherently due to difficulties with his own supporters.Conclusions The Labour Party had then suggested tha,t Mr. Menzies&apos; Govern-Minute 2.) &apos;      ment should resign, but he had rejected this suggestion.Early that morning a Press report had been received that astatement had been issued in Canberra to the effect that the UnitedKingdom and Australian Governments had agreed that an australian Minister, other than the Prime Minister, should be sentto London as soon as possible. We had not, of course, agreed to anysuch course. Indeed, on the 19th August, after discussion in theWar Cabinet, the Prime. Minister had sent a telegram toMr. Menzies making it plain that it would not be possible for a dominion Minister other than the Prime Minister to sit in the WarCabinet, as this would entail representation of all four Dominions,which would involve too large a permanent addition to their numbers.In discussion, Mr. Mackenzie King said that the present system had the great advantage that the communications between theUnited Kingdom and the Canadian Governments were on recordin writing, and there was no possibility of any misunderstanding.No difficulty of any kind had arisen since the outbreak of the war.If at any time a point arose which could not be settled by eorres-pondence, then some Minister could, of course, at once&apos; fly over.
The absence of a Canadian Minister from London meant, in effect,that the Canadian Government were satisfied with what was being-done.Mr. Mackenzie King deprecated strongly the suggestion thatthere was a collective Dominion point of view as opposed to thepoint of view of the Mother Country. Each of the Dominions had its own problems and its own point of view. Each Dominion wasa separate State, with its own access to the Crown.In further discussion, the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs said that the discussions which had taken place in thiscountry about changed methods of representation of dominions were rather unreal and lacked backing. But it must be rememberedthat there was a genuine feeling in Australia in favour of some change in the system of Dominion representation. If a demand forchange was put forward by the Commonwealth of Australia, hethought that it should not be flatly refused.The Prime Minister said that, if such a demand was made, hethought it should be answered on the lines that we should ask whatpowers an Australian Minister in London would have to commit theAustralian Government, and would say that we wished to consult the other Dominions on the matter.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toissue a statement on the following lines to the Press : &apos;&quot;&apos; It was learned in official circles that no confirmationcould be obtained of the report that an agreement hadbeen reached between the United Kingdom and australian government that an Australian Minister, other than thePrime Minister, should proceed to London as soon aspossible.&quot;Turkey.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 86thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The War Cabinet approved a Report by the Chiefs of Staff(W.P. (41) 205) dealing with the suggestion made by the foreign secretary at their previous Meeting that we should be rather more specific than contemplated in the previous instructions as to theextent of the fighter support which we could make available to turkey.

(W.P. (G) (41) 81).The War Cabinet-Gave general approval to the proposal that a full british delegation should be sent from this country. The arrange-ments for the transport of the Delegates should bediscussed inter-departmentally.The Blaok-Out. 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinistry of Minister of Supply (W.P. (G) (41) 76), and a Joint Memorandum bySupply the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security and the vehicles Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (G) (41) 78).and Factories.
In discussion, considerable objections were raised to theproposal in the Minister of Supply&apos;s Memorandum that vehiclesengaged on work for the Ministry of Supply should be permitted to carry headlights from the 15th September throughout the winter.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security pointed outthat the concession could hardly be confined to vehicles in the serviceof one Department, and that a similar claim would be made by theother Supply Departments, and on behalf of other vehicles engaged on vital national work. Further, it was thought that delays wouldbe involved as a result of inspections by the Police to satisfy them-selves that vehicles making use of headlights were entitled to do so.The Prime Minister suggested that advantage should be taken of the present period, in which we were almost entirely free fromnight air attack, to have adequate lighting on vehicles engaged on war work, including, in particular, vehicles used for such purposes has the transport of workers engaged in filling factories. We might thus secure a considerable improvement in our war effort. Iffrequent night air attacks started again, we should have to revert to the regulations now in force.The following other points were made in discussion : (1) The Minister of Labour and National Service thought therewas much to be said in favour of using a light, indepen-dent of the normal headlights, which would give a lowillumination (like a fog lamp).(2) The Minister of Aircraft Production said that greatdifficulty was caused by lack of signposts.(3) The Minister of Supply said that the reference in his paper to the operation of factories after the black-out had been destroyed by blast was intended to refer to cases inwhich some small damage had been effected. He agreedthat it would be impossible to continue factories inoperation at night after the black-out had been entirelydestroyed.The War Cabinet-Decided that the issues involved should be referred to an inter-departmental Committee.The terms of reference to this Committee and its composi-tion are set out in the Minute by the Prime Ministerappended to these Conclusions.Approved the issue of the announcement proposed by theSecretary of State for the Colonies in his Memorandum(W.P. (G) (41) 82), to the effect that constitutional reformsin Ceylon could not be further considered until there hadbeen further examination and consultation, which couldnot be arranged under war conditions.Ceylon.Constitution.10.

ANNEX.(See Minute 9.)Black-out Restrictions.Minute by the Prime Minister.Ministry of Home Security.War Office.Air Ministry.Ministry of Labour and National Service.The Three Supply Departments.The Ministry of War Transport.1. Mr. Harcourt Johnstone will preside over an interdepartmental committee containing representatives of the Offices concerned (see above) for thepurpose of devising the best possible plan for relaxation of the black-outrestrictions during the present comparative lull in the enemy&apos;s Air attack (a) On vehicles required for vital war services, and(b) For factories and ports.The object is to secure the maximum of production for war purposes.2.   The Committee should consider inter alia (a) The categories of vehicles permitted to relax.(b) The subdued character of the lighting enabling them to proceed at areasonable speed.(c) The particular routes over which and areas in which these relaxationsmay be especially required by the Ministry of Supply, Ministry of aircraft Production and the Admiralty, and finally,(d) The means of speedy return to present style if and when this is rendered necessary by enemy action in any district or throughout the country.3. The Committee is to report in one week to the Prime Minister. all departments are expected to co-operate in the public interest to the utmost.The preparation of the best possible plan must be considered a technical study,and does not necessarily commit the ministerial heads of the Departmentsconcerned to its adoption. This may be remitted to a Committee of ministers on grounds of general policv.W. S. C.August 28, 1941.
- MOST SECRET, -ADDENDUM TO W.M.(41) 87th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 7.TURKEY. THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the revision ofparagraph 2 (f) of the instructions for the conduct ofthe Staff Conversations with the Turks, set out in theChiefs of Staffs * Report (W.P.(41) 205), met the point which he had made at the previous Meeting.   -THE PRIME MINISTER said that a plan was &quot;being prepared to send two more British Divisions to the middle east before the end of January, or earlier if possible,if shipping resources permitted.   The Chiefs of Staff andthe Ministry of War Transport were co-operating in working out the amount of shipping which would be required, andhe proposed to make a personal appeal to President Roosevelt.While this demand would, no doubt, involve difficulties forthe United States, he felt sure that they should be able to overcome them.   We already had 14 Divisions in the middle east, not counting the Indian Divisions in Persia.   FurtherIndian Divisions were forming in 1942.   Work was also beingcarried out in overhauling communications, and we could resonably hope to be able to form a front which would hold the enemy forces on the Caspian line.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the Staff Conversa-tions with the Turks had opened well.   The importance whichthey attached to Air support was shown by the fact that,while they were pressing to know what Air support we could give them, they had not as yet made any request to us inregard to land forces .   He asked at what date the Air forcesset out in the Chiefs of Staffs&apos; Memorandum could, be madeavailable, and whether it could, be improved on in 1942.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that his offer was based on the assumption that we had built up our airforces in the Middle East to 62f squadrons .   We had made noplans for building up our forces in the Middle East beyond,that figure.THE PR ME MINISTER said that the extent of the help which we could give to Turkey depended very largely on thesituation in Cyrenaica.   When -chat had been cleaned, upwe might be able to do more.   This matter should be examined at a smaller gathering.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY said that 100 A.A. guns hadbeen promised to Turkey.   Would it not be better to send them to Russia than to Turkey?THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he thought russia would, appreciate the need, for sending A.A. guns to Turkey.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Minister of Supply&apos;suggestion would, be considered.
