(41) 78thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave thefollowing information: As regards the Far East, there was nothing to add to theinformation contained in the telegrams. Mr. Menzies&apos;s state-ment in Australia regarding Japanese concentrations in indo-China seemed to be rather more alarmist than thesituation warranted.The Minister of Information was asked to take steps to ensurethat our press did not exaggerate the immediate seriousness of theposition.A discussion took place on the situation in Thailand, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.1.   The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records 705-708 : Summary of aircraft losses since the 7th August: Home Theatre Enemy 27 destroyed.18 probable.23 damaged.Our Own 23 fighters (2 pilots safe).9 bombers.2 Coastal Command.On the 7th August, when cloud had prevented observation, wehad probably destroyed more than the 4 enemy machines claimed.Overseas Theatre Enemy 2 destroyed.3 probable.6 damaged.Our Own 4 destroyed.2 damaged.During the previous four days our aircraft had hit two enemy merchant vessels and probably a third in home waters, and fourmerchant vessels in overseas waters, totalling 28,000 tons.Our air attacks had virtually brought to an end enemy shippingtraffic in the Channel.Night bombing operations had been hampered by bad weather.On the 9th August an enemy merchant ship raider had beenreported by a civil aircraft some 200 miles west of Brest. A search for this vessel was in progress.There had been indications that U-boats were now collecting onthis side of the Atlantic and more frequent attacks must now beexpected on Gibraltar and Sierra Leone convoys.During the previous four days reports had been received thatfive ships, totalling 12,150 tons, had been sunk.In Estonia the Germans claimed to have reached the sea coastnorth of Rakvere. East of Smolensk the situation had stabilised,but a German drive had started towards Bryansk. In the Ukrainethe Germans were on the outskirts of Kiev, but more important wasthe German drive towards Dnepropetrovsk and Nikolayev, whichhad assumed serious proportions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
U.S.S.E. and turkey.Persia.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 77thConclusions,Minute 5.)Prisoners ofWar.Transfer of germans to canada.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 161stConclusions,Minute 6.)Turkey and persia.Availability ofBritishTechnicians.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 73rdConclusions,Minute 6.)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theRussians had now agreed to the proposal that our Ambassador andthe Soviet Ambassador at Angora should make simultaneousdeclarations to the Turkish Government. The Russians had agreedthat these declarations should not only contain an undertaking to observe scrupulously the territorial integrity of the TurkishRepublic, but should also extend to rendering Turkey all help and assistance in the event of her being attacked by any european power.It was satisfactory that the Turks had wished this assurance to be published, although it was not yet certain whether theRussians would agree to this course.A further discussion took place on the measures proposed tobring pressure to bear on the Persian Government to expel theGerman community now in their country. A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (G) (41) 75) asking for authorityto take up with the Canadian authorities, in consultation with theDominions Office and the Ministry of War Transport, the questionof transferring an additional 2,000 German prisoners of war to canada.The Minister of War Transport said that, although shipping for this purpose was not likely to become available in the nearfuture, it was important that there should be no delay in obtaining the consent of the Canadian Government. Later on, shipping might become available suddenly, and it then would be necessary to take immediate advantage of the opportunity.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for War to proceed asproposed in W.P. (G) (41) 75.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (41) 188) about the recruitment of British technicians for service in Turkey andpossibly also in Persia.The Minister of Labour and National Service explained that not a large number of technicians were required. For Turkey thenumber was about fifty-three. While industry could make a contri-bution, he thought it was essential that the Service departments should be willing to supply a number of men.The Secretary of State for Air emphasised the difficulty whichwould be experienced in parting with any appreciable number ofR.A.F. technicians.In discussion, the view taken was that, if the policy of infiltra-tion was to be effectively carried out, the Services must make men available.   The numbers required were not great, and would, ofcourse, be replaced from industry.The War Cabinet--Gave general approval to the methods of recruitingtechnicians for service in Turkey (and, if necessary, alsoin Persia) proposed in W.P. (41) 188, on the understandingthat the numbers concerned were not large, and authorised the Minister of Labour and National Service to proceed accordingly, in co-operation with the other Ministers,concerned.)
