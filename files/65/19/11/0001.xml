The Gneisenau and the Prince Eugen were still there.The important supply convoy had successfully completed its passage to Malta.Grand Harbour, Valletta, had been heavily but unsuccessfully attacked by E-boats and one-man torpedo boats in the early morning of the 26th July. About 10 enemy boats and 3 escorting fighters had been destroyed by shore batteries and R.A.F. fighters; twentyprisoners had been taken.Two ships totalling some 4,000 tons had been sunk by sub-marines during the previous four days.   Belated reports of the sinking of vessels totalling 13,000 tons had also been received.Military The German advance had made comparatively little progressOperations. during the past week, except to the South and South-East of Kiev.U.S.S.R. There had been heavy fighting in the Northern Sector towardsLeningrad, and in the Smolensk Sector, where the enemy was making his principal effort; the situation was still confused, butGerman forces were well east of Smolensk, which was possibly intheir hands.There had been regular air raids of varying intensity onMoscow.   So far, the indications were that the morale of theinhabitants was good.Far Bast.   . There were indications of Japanese preparations for possible,, action through Manchukuo.&quot;&apos; The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
U.S.S.R.Supply of WarMaterial.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 74thConclusions,Minute 3.)Russo-PolishNegotiations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 74thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The War Cabinet were informed that an urgent requesthad been received from Russia for the supply of 10,000 to12,000 tons of rubber. An answer had been sent asking for further particulars and saying that we would deliver this amount of rubberas quickly as possible.The view was generally expressed that, if necessary, in orderto ensure speedy supply, we should send 10,000 tons of rubber fromstocks in this country.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Supply to consult on this matter with the Paymaster-General, who, as Chairman of theCommittee for the Co-ordination of Allied Supplies, hadbeen asked to deal with this request as a matter of urgency.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a polish Cabinet crisis had occurred on the question and three ministers, including the Foreign Secretary, had resigned. ThePolish President was also against the Treaty.Sir Stafford Cripps had, however, secured two helpful con-cessions from the Russians (Telegrams 859 and 860 from Moscow).He (the Foreign Secretary) was seeing the Poles again that evening,when he hoped that these concessions would resolve the Polishdifficulties. He also proposed to ask the Poles whether, in the lightof the modifications in the text of the Treaty made at Sir stafford cripps&apos;s suggestion, they would be ready to dispense with a note from ourselves saying that we did not recognise the territorialchanges affecting Poland made since August 1939.The War Cabinet took note of the above information.Iran (Persia).(previous reference:W.M. (41) 71stConclusions, &apos;Minute 2.)   *Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous kef erence:W.M. (41) 59thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theSoviet Government had now informed us that they were willing totake part with us in any military plans that might be necessary tosecure the expulsion of the large numbers of Germans from thatcountry. They agreed that a concentration of their forces and oursshould precede the presentation of our joint demands, and asked that the details of these military plans should be worked out in moscow. The Russians proposed to add a further demand, i.e., thefree transit of troops and raw material across Persia. He (theForeign Secretary) thought that, notwithstanding the Swedishprecedent, there might be some difficulty in linking up this seconddemand with the first.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should proceed, inconjunction with the Russian Government, to concertmeasures to enable military pressure to be brought to bearon Iran in order to secure the expulsion of Germans inthat country.No request for the free transit of troops and war materialsacross Persia should be made at this stage; but the matter could, if necessary, be raised later.5. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security that some sixty enemy aircraft had raided East and South london on the previous, evening. There had been a certain amount of damage to railway communications and house property.

The Far East.Japan.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 73rdConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that,following the freezing of Japanese assets and other measures takenby the United States, the Dutch, Dominion Governments and ourselves, in consequence of Japan&apos;s action in Indo-China, hethought that the suggestion should now be made to the UnitedStates Government that the same Governments should make joint, orparallel, representations to Japan, warning her that any further action inimical to our joint interests would lead to trouble. Actionon these lines afforded, he thought, by far the best chance of stopping a further Japanese movement. But the United states might be unwilling to make the proposed declaration in respect ofThailand.The Secretary of State added that the Chinese were of theopinion that Japan&apos;s next step would be to try to cut the burma road, in which case they would want assistance from us. Theviews of the Chiefs of Staff on this contingency would be welcome.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the action proposed by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.(b) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to report on what action theyadvised in the event of a Japanese attempt to cut the burma Road.Far East.defence measures in malaya.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 66thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theForeign Secretary (W.P. (41) 180) on certain defence measures in malaya.The point at issue was whether (1) Action for the time being should be confined to the removalof Japanese nationals from certain areas in Malaya,suggested by the Commander-in-Chief, Far East,including the Kelantan iron mine; or(2) Further action should be taken, including (a) the entire prohibition of all traffic of tugs andlighters between harbour mouths and foreign ships at anchor off the harbour; or(b) the prohibition of loading of foreign ships if morethan one was either at anchor or in sight.The Secretary of State for the Colonies thought that action should for the present be confined to the steps set out in (1).The War Cabinet-Agreed that for the time being action should be confined to that set out under head (1), but agreed that the foreign secretary should not hesitate to authorise the further stepsset out under (2) if and when he thought that the situationrendered this course advisable.The Far East.Cooperationwith theNetherlandsGovernment.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 72ndConclusions,Minute 10.)u xiT - Wa/* Cabmet a am had before them the Memorandumby the Foreign Secretary (W.P. (41) 168) which had been discussed at the meeting held a week earlier.-n-i a/ t discussion (which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard* lie. of War Cabinet Conclusions), the War Cabinet-(a) Agreed that this matter should stand over for. a furtherlb) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in his discussion with theUnited States representatives on Far Eastern matters,
to stress the point that the restriction on oil exports from the U.S.A. to Japan, following on Japan&apos;s actionin Indo-China, would increase Japanese pressure on theNetherlands East Indies.    .Blockade Polioy.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 53rdConclusions,Minute 3.)Scuttling.Treatment ofCrews whoscuttle enemy ships.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 62ndConclusions,Minute 3.)9. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda on blockade policy by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theMinister of Economic Warfare (W.P. (41) 175 and 176).The Foreign Secretary said pressure was being brought to bearby certain of the Allied Governments to allow food to be sent intothe occupied territories. The position was made more difficult bythe fact that our blockade of unoccupied France was ineffective,and that cargoes were being freely landed at Marseilles, most ofwhich was taken by the Germans. The greatest hardship was,perhaps, being experienced in Belgium. He suggested that weshould indicate that, if it was possible to arrange for supervisionin Belgium by the United States branch of the Red Cross, we wouldbe willing to give consideration to allowing a certain amount of milk, &amp;c, to be sent into the country, to be issued under their control. As at present advised, it seemed unlikely that the germans would agree to allow the United States Red Cross to operate in belgium.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that the fact that wehad been unable, owing to the preoccupations of the Navy, toprevent a leak in the blockade through unoccupied France was noargument why we should ourselves make another hole elsewhere.He emphasised the difficulties of keeping within limits any con-cession granted, however small that concession might be at the outset. He asked that no decision should be taken until there hadbeen time to study the report he had submitted as to the food position in Europe. In any case, the harvest would now shortly begathered in, and there could be no question of acute shortage forsome little time.The Prime Minister emphasised the importance of maintaining the position that the Germans were responsible for the feeding ofthe people whose countries they had overrun. He was not aware of any great pressure on the matter from the United States ofAmerica, and thought that it would be wrong to make any concession at the present time.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed to the importance of maintaining the principle thatthe Germans were responsible for feeding the people ofthe countries which they had overrun.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in his reply to the represen-tations which had been made to him, to stress this principle, and to state that, in the opinion of the WarCabinet,&apos; this was, in any case, an inopportune moment to consider the requests which had been made, seeing that the harvests which would shortly be carried mustsurely meet any immediate necessities.10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W;P. (41) 178).The War Cabinet-Concurred iii the view set out in this; Memorandum,; namely, that it would be undesirable to issue a statement to the effect that we should ho longer rescue crews whichscuttled enemy merchant, ships.    -
Man-Power.Miners andA.D.G.B.(PreviousEeferenceW.M. (41) 71stConclusions,Minute 6.)12. The Lord Privy Seal said he had been informed that anumber of miners were employed in searchlight units of A.D.G.B.He asked whether the decision that miners should not be released from the Army to return to the mines covered men serving in these units.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that the registration of miners now in other occupations had been carriedout very swiftly. 23,000 men had volunteered to return to the mines. He hoped that 25,000 men would return to the mines withina fortnight. He also referred to a Minute from the Prime Minister,dated the 27th July, indicating that the total requirements of man-power for the Army might have to be increased above the figure of2,195,000, and calling for a report on these additional requirements and the measures necessary to meet them. In the circumstances, hesuggested that the right course would be to adhere to the ruling thatno miners should be released from the Army, but to deal with therelease of miners from searchlight units, and their replacement by women, as part of the general problem of the Army&apos;s man-power requirements.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the suggestion made by the Minister of Labourand National Service at &quot;X,&quot; and invited the Secretaryof State for War to submit a special Report as to the steps which could be taken to comb out able-bodied men fromsedentary occupations in the Army (including searchlightunits of A.D.G.B.). This Report should be taken intoconsideration as part of the general enquiry into theArmy&apos;s additional requirements of man-power called forin the Prime Minister&apos;s Minute.Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 28, 1941.Lighting 11.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theRestrictions. Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (G) (41) 71)Improved Street on the question whether an attempt should be made to obtain anLighting. improvement in street lighting in the forthcoming winter.(Previous The w     Cabinet-Keterenee:W.M.
