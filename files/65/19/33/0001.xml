(41) 19thConclusions,Minute 2.).MilitaryOperations.Libya.U.S.S.R.1. The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 751-753 : Owing to weather conditions there had been little activity inthe Home Theatre. One German aircraft had been damaged; wehad lost two coastal command aircraft; one enemy merchant vesselhad been hit.Overseas we had destroyed one German aircraft for the lossof four of our own bombers, and had hit three enemy merchantvessels.During the previous three days we had lost four ships totalling15.000 tons; three ships had been damaged totalling 17,000 tons.Several of the supply vessels now on the way here from america had rifles on board.There was nothing to report at Tobruk, although an enemy attack was expected.There was no real change on the Russian Front. Leningradcontinued to put up a stout resistance. The enemy had reached apoint on the coast west of Leningrad 8 miles from the town. Theenemy had effected a landing on Dago Island. Fighting continued in the pocket of Russian resistance left after the fall of Kiev. TheRussians were believed to have extricated some of their forces out.of the pocket. In all probability the enemy claims greatlyexaggerated the number of prisoners and weapons they had captured in the Kiev sector.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for War to make special arrangements for the speedy reception and distributionof the small arms now arriving from the United States.Production.Allegations ofInefficiency.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 73rdConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to threearticles in that morning&apos;s newspapers making allegations ofinefficiency in production matters : (a) An article in the Daily Mail, entitled &quot; Valley of Chaos.&quot;This was believed to refer to the Stroud Valley.(6) An article in the Daily Herald about a factory at Erith.(c) A report in The Times of a speech by Mr. Gordon England,Chairman of the Engineering Industries Association.The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord President of the Council to convene ameeting of the Ministers concerned to investigate these-allegations.[22953]b 2
Parliament.Next Sitting ofthe House ofCommons.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 96thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Prime Minister said that, as Parliament wouldprobably sit for two or three weeks, there was no reason to have aSecret Session as soon as Parliament reassembled. He proposed,therefore, in the following week to make a public statement only.If it became clear that it was necessary to give Parliament a full statement of the position in regard to aid to Russia, arrangements would be made for a Secret Session in the following week.InternmentCamp at Peel,Isle of Man.Riots andEscape ofInternees.4. The Home Secretary made a report on the escape andrecapture of three internees from the Internment Camp at Peel,Isle of Man. The men had been put in detention after theirrecapture and some rioting among the other internees had followed.An enquiry was in progress and he would take any necessary actionon its report. He would probably transfer the ringleaders to prisonand use Police to control the internees. Nobody had been hurt inthe rioting and the whole business had been exaggerated by thePress. The internees at Peel were a mixed bag, including BritishFascists and British subjects of German and Italian origin.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Free France.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 96thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Foreign Secretary said that on the previous evening heand the First Lord had had long discussions with General de gaulle and Admiral Muselier. The result had been that the General andthe Admiral had agreed to continue in somewhat uneasy association.The Foreign Secretary added that the Minister of war transport was disturbed at the proposal that Admiral Museliershould have control of the Free French Navy and Mercantile Marine.He thought that the officers and men of vessels of the FrenchMerchant Navy now working for us would very much dislike being put under Admiral Muselier.The Prime Minister said that, of course, there was no intentionto give the Free French any increased measure of control, over and above what they already possessed, of French merchant ships orcrews. If there was any doubt on this point, the Foreign secretary should take an early opportunity of making this clear to the free french Headquarters.Discussion then followed as to whether we should now lift theban on an announcement of the setting up of the Free FrenchCouncil.The War Cabinet were informed that the general impression was that, with one or two exceptions, the members of the council were in effect nominess of General de Gaulle, who would echo his views.Some discussion ensued as to whether an effort should be madeat this stage to get further names added, but it was decided thatthe best plan would be to agree to the Council being announced inthe form now proposed.If need be, we could always ask for further names to be addedlater.The War Cabinet-Agreed that an announcement of the Council of FreeFrance might now be made in the Press, and invited theMinister of Information to use his influence with theEditors to secure that there was as little comment aspossible on the personnel of the new Council, having regardto the continued risk of controversy within the Free FrenchMovement.
57W.M. 97 (41).&apos;Syria. 6.   The Prime Minister invited. attention to recent telegrams(Previous from Syria, which revealed a disquieting position.  Shots had beenEeference: exchanged between a party of French officials engaged on collectingW.M. (41) 87th taxes and a party of Syrians.  He invited the Foreign Secretary to conclusions, hold a meeting with the Minister of State, the Secretary of StateMinute 2.) for the Colonies and the Secretary of State for War, in order to clear up present difficulties and define policy.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Allies. 7,   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMilitary Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (G) (41) 98) proposingConscription. that legislation should be introduced into Parliament by which(Previous Allied nationals in this country, who were not already in theirEeferenee:       national forces or reserved from military service because of theW.M. (41) 53rd  importance of their civil employment, should be given the free rightConclusions,      0$ option between joining their national forces or the British forces.Minute 2.)       This was in substitution for our previous undertaking to inviteParliament to pass legislation conferring authority upon the AlliedAdministrations in this country to call up their nationals formilitary service in accordance with their existing national laws.The War Cabinet Approved the proposal set out in this paper and invited theForeign Secretary to communicate with the Allied Govern-ments in the terms of the note attached to W.P. (G) (41) 98.Man Power.Liability to military Serviceof certain members of theOxford Group.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 95thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Prime Minister said that he had now received a furtherletter from the Free Church Federal Council asking him to receive a deputation, and enclosing a copy of a resolution to the effect thatthe Free Church Federal Council deplored the decision of theMinister of Labour. It was, of course, most unfair to attribute tothe Minister of Labour a decision taken by the whole Cabinet. Inhis (the Prime Ministers) opinion, the previous decision on thismatter should be adhered to. Should the matter be raised inParliament and a motion put down, then the Whips should be puton and a division taken.The War Cabinet agreed with the view expressed by thePrime Minister.Wheat. 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum cir-Draft culated by direction of the Prime Minister, and a copy of a letterInternational from the United States Ambassador to the Secretary of State for agreement.       Foreign Affairs (W.P. (G) (41) 99 and 100).The main point in the Memorandum circulated by direction ofthe Prime Minister was that the proposals before the international wheat Advisory Committee at Washington for restriction of outputwere capable of being represented by the enemy as an intention onthe part of the United States and ourselves to force the peasantpopulations of Europe to reduce their crops. Such representationsmight ^go a long way in consolidating public opinion against an anglo-Saxon victory and in favour of tne,German &quot; New Order.&quot;In discussion, there was general agreement that this was a very real danger, and that we must guard against it. This point of view had, however, been taken into account in the previous discussions of the draft Agreement on the Lord Presidents Committee.
The present position in regard to the negotiations was explained to the War Cabinet. We had made it clear that the draft agreement which had emerged from the discussions in Washingtonwas unacceptable to us and would require substantial modification.New instructions were being prepared for our Delegates, and steps were being taken to strengthen our Delegation in anticipation ofa resumption of the discussions in Washington in the middle ofOctober.The War Cabinet-(1) Recorded the view that we should not enter into any agreement which was open to the interpretation thatthe United States and this country intended to forcerestriction of wheat crops on the peoples of Europe afterthe War.(2) Asked that the revised Instructions to our Delegates to theInternational Wheat Advisory Committee should besubmitted to them.Great George Street, S. W. 1,September 25, 1941.
