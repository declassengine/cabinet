The War Cabinet had a short discussion, which is recorded and Turicey.      in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.U.S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M.

Maisky, which hadbeen attended by the First Sea Lord. The main points in discussionare recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to arrange for a discussion between Lord Hahkey and General Gblikov in regard to supplies of war material beforie the latter went to the United States.Tfie PHme MiMster said that he Was most ahxious that wesnbtild do all we could to help,the Russians. He asked whether some of the Tomahawk aircraft assigned to us could tie madeavailable.The Secretary of State -for. Air said that this matter was nowunder discussion-, lie undertook to inform /the Prime Minister assoon as possible of the decisidh feachefcl.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements......:X-   The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 688-690 :-Summary of aircraft losses since the 2lst JulyHome Theatre^Enemy 25 destroyed.4 probable.19 damaged.Our Own 23 Fighters (6 pilots safe).8 Bombers.Overseas Theatre Enemy 1 destroyed.Our Own Nil.On the 22nd July Blenheims had successfully attacked anenemy convoy southbound from Pantellaria, sinking three medium-sized merchant ships and damaging one and one escorting destroyer.It was believed that the Sehamhorst had received a direct hitduring an attack made on her at La Pallice on the previous evening.Particulars were given of the Italian air attack on ahimportant convoy from Gibraltar to Malta which had taken placeon the previous morning. H.M.S. Manchester and ELM. destroyerFiredrake had been damaged and H.M. destroyer Fearless had been sunk. One of the ships in the convoy had been hit by a torpedo, but had not been sunk. These, so far, had been the only casualties, andit was hoped that the convoy would make Malta without furthermishap during that day.No ships had been damaged or sunk by enemy action duringthe previous four days, but one ship of 6,000 tons had been slinkfrom other causes and one of 4,000 tons damaged.It seemed clear that Russian forces were still holding Smolensk,but that there were German forces to the.east of the town.The Germans were perturbed at-the strong Russian resistance.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
Indo-China.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 72ndConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thattelegrams Nos. 3409 and 3410 from Washington showed that, on the seizure by Japan of bases in Indo-China, the United Statesproposed to freeze Japanese assets in the United States, to make allimports from Japan subject to licence and to restrict exports ofpetroleum products. It seemed unlikely, however, that they would put these measures into operation for two or three days. In viewof the importance of keeping in step with the United States, theForeign Secretary proposed not to make any immediate announce-ment of the action which we proposed to take. As soon as it wasopportune, he would announce, first, the denunciation of the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty; secondly, the freezing of japanese assets. On this latter point we were in communication with theDominion Governments, but had not yet obtained their approval.The War Cabinet-(i) Approved the course proposed by the Foreign Secretary,(ii) Invited the Admiralty and the Ministry of War transport to consider whether steps could be taken to denybunkering facilities to Japanese ships.Syria.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 66thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Prime Minister referred to the very difficultdiscussions which had taken place between the Minister of Stateand General de Gaulle. The former had handled the situation well.It was to be hoped that General de Gaulle would soon return to thiscountry.Turkey andIran.Availability ofBritishTechnicians.6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theForeign Secretary (W.P. (41) 177) on the steps to be taken to providea number of technicians for work in Turkey, and possibly also inIran if the Government of that country agreed to rid themselves of German technicians.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s suggestion that a specialeffort should be made to provide the technicians now required, and those who might be required by Iran, andthat the Heads of the Departments concerned theMinistry of Supply, the Admiralty, the War Office, andpossibly the Air Ministry should now give directionsthat the men should be made available.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service toco-ordinate action in this matter.Production.forthcoming debate.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 72ndConclusions,Minute 11.)7. General discussion took place on the line to be taken in theforthcoming Production Debate.No doubts were entertained of the soundness of our generalproduction organisation, and there was no support for thesuggestion of a single War Cabinet Minister exercising supervisorypowers over all the Production Departments. The success whichhad attended the allocation system might well be stressed in the debate, and also the extent to which the capacity of particularfactories was allocated to particular Departments, thus limiting thefield in which there was scope for competition between Departments.As regards the output of labour, the case should not be pitchedtoo high. On the one hand, there were many favourable features inthe position for example, the absence of trade disputes or of anyspirit of ca&apos;canny; while the numbers who had come forward for
voluntary transfer to the coal-mines, to shipbuilding and repairingwork, or to the Mercantile Marine were very striking. At the sametime, it was felt that a general improvement in output could be looked for.There had probably been some decline from the very high rateof endeavour reached in the Dunkirk period. In part, this mightbe due to the continued dilution of labour and to the fact that thenew hands had not had time to get fully trained. But the lull in air attacks, and the fact that we had no big land forces continuouslyengaged in heavy fighting and suffering casualties, probablyaccounted for some falling off. This was a psychological point which the Minister of Information might perhaps bear in mind,not in relation to industry only, but to our whole war effort. Again,the food restrictions had probably produced some lassitude, moreparticularly among workers carrying out very heavy processes.There was also some evidence that the women&apos;s health had been affected by bombing. This might account for some of the heavyabsenteeism among women workers.It was also important that the reason for the delays, e.g., in the arrival of fabricated materials, which led to men standing idle inthe factories, should be better understood. At present this often ledto widespread complaints.The War Cabinet took note of this discussion.Great George Street, S. W. 1,July 24, 1941.
