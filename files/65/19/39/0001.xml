War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (41) 241) and theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (41) 240) in regard to our policyin Ethiopia.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, duringthe Minister of State&apos;s visit to this country, a Meeting of ministers had been held at which various Conclusions had been reached on future policy (see Annex to W.P. (41) 240). The main point hadbeen that Ethiopia should be treated not as a Protectorate, but asan Independent State, subject to the necessary safeguards and provisions. It had been agreed to await the observations ofGeneral Platt as regards military requirements. He (the foreign secretary) was strongly of opinion that, if we embarked on a course which was tantamount to administering the country ourselves, wewere bound to land ourselves in serious trouble.In discussion, these views met with general approval.As regards procedure, the Foreign Secretary thought that, after certain broad issues of principle had been decided, the conduct ofthe negotiations for an agreement should be entrusted to theMinister of State, with such assistance as he might ask for.The Secretary of State for War said that his advisers held thatthe course proposed by the Foreign Secretary would result in theadministration of Ethiopia breaking down, and that this wouldinvolve us in a serious military commitment. All he asked for atthe moment, however, was that Sir Phillip Mitchell should bebrought home in order that his advice might be sought before any final decision regarding the administration of the country wastaken.The War Cabinet agreed as follows(1). The Foreign Secretary was invited, in consultation with theSecretary of State for War, to send a telegram to theMinister of State on the following lines : -(a) It was the intention of the War Cabinet that theMinister of State should be charged with the negotiation of the Agreement with the emperor of Ethiopia, after decisions in principle had beentaken in this country.(b) Before final instructions were sent to the Ministerof State as to the terms of the Agreement to be negotiated, they would be glad to receive an expression of his (the Minister of State&apos;s) viewson the position, after he had discussed the matterwithSir Phillip Mitchell and his other advisers.
Parliament. 7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theApplication to   Home Secretary on the question whether special exemption shouldMembers of       be granted to the Members of both Houses of Parliament from theRegulations      Regulations controlling traffic to Ireland (W.P. (G) (41) 112).controlling In discussion, it was pointed out that the restrictions on travelTraffic to Eire, to Northern Ireland were based partly on the limited travel facilities available, and also on Security grounds, since anyone couldpass from Northern into Southern Ireland. The case, therefore,was somewhat less strong than as regards access to the variousrestricted areas.Nevertheless, there was general support for the HomeSecretary&apos;s view that no concession should be made in this matter to Members of Parliament.The Prime Minister suggested that the matter might be dealtwith on the basis that, while Members of Parliament rightly hadmany privileges, they would not be well advised to claim any specialprivilege, not possessed by civilians generally, in regard to thisparticular matter.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the Home Secretary&apos;s view as set out in his memorandum, namely, that the objections to granting to members of both Houses of Parliament special exemption from the Regulations controlling traffic to Ireland out-weighed the advantage of any concession, and agreed thatthe present position should therefore be maintained.Great George Street. S.W. 1,October 16, 1941.(c) It was also desired to give Sir Phillip Mitchell anopportunity of expressing his views before theinstructions were finally issued. The WarCabinet therefore asked that he should return tothis country as soon as possible for a short visit.(2) The War Cabinet took note of a statement by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs that it would be desirableto keep Field-Marshal Smuts informed of whateverdecisions were reached.
