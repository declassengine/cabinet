1. Reference was made to the result of the Wrekin by-election,in which the Government candidate had had a small majority.The Prime Minister said that such results might well give anentirely false impression to public opinion abroad of the degree of support which the National Government had in the country. Forthis reason it was important that the Government case should be strongly represented at by-elections, and that Government speakersshould go down to the constituencies in which by-elections werebeing held.The War Cabinet endorsed this view.2. The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 754-757 : Summary of aircraft losses since the 25th September : Home Theatre Enemy 22 destroyed.13 probable.17 damaged.Our Own 15 fighters (3 pilots safe).6 bombers.Overseas Theatre Enemy 6 destroyed.8 probable.38 damaged.Our Own 11 fighters (6 pilots safe).1 damaged.Russia (Murmansk Area) Enemy 12 destroyed.2 probable.Our Own 1 fighter.Thirty of our machines had bombed Genoa on the previous night, but five had crashed on return.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to look into the possibilityof dispelling fog on aerodromes by heat or by other means.The Air Force had co-operated in the protection of the convoywhich had arrived at Malta on the previous day by attacking enemy aerodromes. Thirty-seven machines had been destroyed or damagedon the ground and five in the air.Our aircraft had hit three Flak ships, two tankers and oneminesweeper in home waters and three merchant ships in theMediterranean.Naval Eight out of the nine ships in the important convoy carryingOperations. personnel and stores from the United Kingdom through the StraitsThe Malta of Gibraltar had arrived at Malta on the previous day. One ship,Convoy. the Imperial Star (12,427 tons) had been lost.   Aircraft fromArk Royal had been ordered to attack units of the Italian Fleet, butit was not yet clear with what success. Air reconnaissance that day had reported one Italian cruiser being towed into Messina and a destroyer disabled.[22959] b 2Parliament.By-elections.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M.

Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.U.S.S.E.Libya.East Africa.The homeward-bound Gibraltar Convoy had been repeatedlyattacked by U-boats and had been reduced from 24 to 15 ships.The homeward-bound Sierra Leone Convoy had also been attacked and had been reduced from 11 ships to 4. An enquiry was beingmade into the attacks on these convoys in, order to ascertain the best method of frustrating the latest U-boat tactics. consideration would be given to the possibility of giving our merchant ships onthis route extra endurance.Since the previous Cabinet we had lost 54,000 tons of shipping.This included 12,000 tons of marine casualties.A successful local Russian attack had been carried out against german forces attempting to reach Murmansk. In the Leningradand Central Sectors no material change had taken place. german forces would probably be occupied for some time in mopping-upoperations in the Kiev area. The German advance to Kharkov fromthe Poltava area had met with strong resistance. In the Crimeaarea heavy fighting was in progress, but the Germans had madelittle progress. There was as yet no sign that the expected combined operations against the Crimea had begun.There were signs that an enemy attack on Tobruk might takeplace at any moment.The Italian garrison at Wolchefit had surrendered and was believed to have consisted of some 3,000 white troops and 2,000natives. Three thousand white and 5,000 native troops were estimated to be still in this area.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Middle East.MilitarySituation:australian troops.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 94thConclusions,Minute 2.)U.S.S.R.MoscowMeeting.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 95thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The War Cabinet were given certain further information which is recorded in the Secretary^ Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.4. The Prime Minister said he had received a telegram fromthe Minister of Supply stating that he had arrived in Moscow onthe previous day and had already had a satisfactory meeting, atwhich M. Stalin, M. Molotov and Mr. Harriman were present.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Persia.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 95thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that therewas evidence of some disorder in parts of Persia, and that theSoviet Government did not show interest in seeing that the PersianCivil Administration continued in being.The Foreign Secretary said that our anxieties on this matter had been put to M. Maisky by Sir Alexander Cadogan on Saturday.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff added that the Shahof Persia was now on his way to Mauritius via Bombay, and that470 male Germans had reached Basra from Persia.
Turkey.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 91stConclusions,Minute 3.)X&quot;The Press.Attitudetowards theGovernment.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 95thConclusions,Minute 7.)The Foreign Secretary said that the terms of the proposed treaty between Russia, ourselves and Persia had been sent to theSoviet Government and to Sir R. Bullard. He hoped to learn theSoviet Governments comments on the proposed terms fromM. Maisky that evening.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it looked as though matters were going rather better for us in regardto the pressure which Germany was putting on Turkey to sellchrome to her.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that four destroyers and four submarines, for which Turkey had placed orders in thiscountry, would soon be ready for delivery. We badly needed these vessels ourselves. The position, however, had been complicated bythe fact that Admiral Kelly, Special Representative at Ankara ofthe Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, had, on his own responsi-bility, put forward a proposal that these vessels should all be sent tothe Eastern Mediterranean, that one destroyer and one submarineshould be delivered to Turkey immediately, and that we should keepthe remainder of the vessels for six months, at the end of which time we should hand them over to Turkey.The Prime Minister expressed doubts whether we should deriveany benefit from allowing these vessels to be handed over to Turkey,comparable with their fighting value to us.On the other hand, the view was expressed that it would bedifficult to recede at this stage from the proposal put forward by admiral Kelly. Further, we had had to refuse a number of requestspUt forward by the Turkish Government, and the negative effect of retaining all these vessels for our own use would probably be unfortunate.The Foreign Secretary added that he proposed to instruct our ambassador that we should find it difficult to go back on the offer made by Admiral Kelly. It should be left to the Ambassadorsdiscretion whether to confirm this offer now, on condition that theTurkish Government refuse chrome to Germany, or later as areward for refusal.The War Cabinet-Agreed that this matter should be dealt With on the lines proposed by the Foreign Secretary at &quot;X.&quot;7. A short discussion took place in Which several Ministersexpressed their sense of dissatisfaction with the attitude adoptedby certain newspapers Which appeared to seize every opportunityof representing the Governments actions in an unfavourable light.The attitude was probably encouraged by the absence of air attacks on this country.the Prime Minister said that it was his intention to take apretty firm line with the Governments critics in his statement inthe House of Commons on the following day.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Air Policy. 8.   A short discussion took place on our policy in abstainingThe Bombing of from bombing Ronie. We had let it be known that we held ourselves.Rome. free to bomb Rome if Cairo were bombed.   The Italians had(Previous bombed the outskirts of Cairo.

(41) 229) about politicalFactories and    meetings in factories and in Government offices.Government The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply saidOffices. that his Department had taken the line that no meetings sponsored by political parties could be allowed in the factories under their control.The War Cabinet-Approved the recommendations in W.P. (41) 229, and inparticular (a) That it be made a definite policy that no politicalmeetings of any kind shall be held in government offices or in factories or other establishmentsdirectly under Government control; and(b) That, as regards factories under private management,the Trade Union Congress and the british employers&apos; Federation should be informed of thisdecision.The action under (b) above should be taken by the Minister ofLabour and National Service.Production.Allegations ofInefficiency.(previous reference:W.M.

(G) (41) 103) on the allegationswhich had appeared in certain newspapers as to inefficiency in production matters.The Secretary of State for Air drew attention to the proposal that the Air Ministry Accounts Office, now in the Stroud Valley,could be accommodated at Malvern. Three hundred out of the800 staff of this office were locally recruited, and it might benecessary for the Minister of Labour and National Service to directthese employees to continue to serve in the office after its removal.The War Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Report by the Lord*        President of the Council (W.P. (G) (41) 103).China.Delivery ofLease-LendAircraft from india.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 71stConclusions,Minute 7.)11.   The War Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (W.P. (41) 227).Great George Street, S.W.September 29, 1941.1,The reasons for still abstaining from bombing Rome were (1) It was doubtful whether we could argue that the town ofCairo had, in fact, been bombed.(2) So long as we held back, the danger of Rome being bombedmight deter the Italians from carrying out a seriousattack on Cairo.(3) Our bombers had more attractive targets to attack thanRome.The Prime Minister said that he would consult with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the desirability ofreferring to this subject in his statement on the following day.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
