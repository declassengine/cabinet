121W.M. 66 (M)*Naval, Militaryatad AbbOperations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 65thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations/1. The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Boom Records Nos, 670-673: Summary of aircraft losses since the 3rd July :-Home Theatre Enemy 38 destroyed.17 probable.25 damaged.Our Own 12 Fighters (1 pilot saved).18 Bombers.2 Coastal Command.Attacks onBrest.naval operations.Shipping Losses.S.5! St. Didier.MilitaryOperations.U.S.S.R.East Africa.Overseas Theatres Enemy 9 destroyed.8 probable.Our Own 6 destroyed.1 damaged.In the last four days we had made very successfuFair attacks on shipping. Direct hits had been obtained on 23 ships, 5 othershad probably been hit, and 5 had been damaged by near-misses.These figures included 7 enemy ships sunk that morning in theChannel.That morning 8 heavy bombers with a strong fighter escort had made a bombing attack on a factory at Albert. Three enemy fighters had been shot down.There were special reasons why Brest had been attacked on two nights recently. Our main night bombing effort would fall on bigGerman industrial centres.During the previous four days two ships had been sunk by submarine, two by aircraft and one mined, totalling 12,500 tons.7,000 tons of shipping had been damaged. Belated reports had beenreceived of 19,000 tons of shipping sunk.The Vichy French supply ship St. Didier had been located in turkish territorial waters and had subsequently been sunk by naval aircraft in Antalya Harbour. It was agreed that we must continueto attack such supply ships. Should territorial waters be infringedin the process, suitable apologies would have to be made to Turkey.The German attacks had resulted in considerable advances, butthe Red Army was still fighting better than we might have hoped.The Germans were believed to have had heavy losses. Besides themain offensives directed towards Moscow via Smolensk and Kiev, athrust from the south towards Leningrad had now begun. In theUkraine the Germans had reached NovogradVolinsk. Tarnopol andStanislavov had both fallen. This operation Was probably intendedto turn the Dneister position.Much would depend on the next fOw days, and it Was uncertain whether the German forces had been halted by the stout russian resistance Or had paused for maintenance purposes. It was important that the&quot; Russian Air Force was still fighting.The Italian forces in Ethiopia had been cleaned up, with the&quot;exception of those in the Gondar area.  Owing to the rains, whichlasted until the end of August, it might not be possible to clean up this/ fttfce within; the&apos; next few1 weeks.   We should hot, however&apos;;;retain any large1 forces for this purpose.[22693]b 2
Syria.A number of tanks had. been sent to Syria and the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, had been told of the importance of a speedyend to operations.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Syria.[Relations with free French.(previous reference:W.M.

The Prime Minister read to the War(2368 Twist^he had sent to a telegram (No. 1 Twist)from the Minister of State in Cairo regarding our relations with theFree French in Syria and the administration of that country.The War Cabinet approved the policy suggested in these telegrams.ar Cabinet the replyo. 1 Twist) * receivedIceland (G).(previous reference erence:W.M.

As soon as they had arrived, President Roosevelt would make an announcement to congress.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, whilst itwas most desirable that the arrival of these United States Marinesshould receive wide publicity, emphasis should be laid on the factthat the Americans were undertaking this operation more for thesecurity of the Western Hemisphere than to help us.The Foreign Secretary added that, in view of this development,the visit of the Duke of Kent to Iceland (C) had been postponed.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The middle east.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 64thConclusions,Minute 2.)(previous reference:W.M. (41) 32ndConclusions,Minute 1.)4.   The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the telegram from Field-Marshal Smutscirculated under cover of W.P. (41) 153.(ii) Invited the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to consultGeneral Auchinleck with regard to paragraph 3 of theabove telegram.(iii) Took note that a report of the fighting at Agheila duringthe German offensive in the Western Desert in March-April 1941 had now been received and would be circulated.foreign information.Russo-PolishRelations.RussianRequests forBritish military action.5.   The Foreign Secretary gave the following information: After separate interviews had taken place, since the last meeting of the War Cabinet, with representatives of the Poles and russians, a meeting had been held between M. Maisky and GeneralSikorski and M. Zaleski. As the result of this meeting, M. Maiskyhad telegraphed certain proposals to his Government, and it was hoped that an agreement would be reached between the twocountries. From the Russian point of view, the most difficult itemwas perhaps the proposal that the large number of Polish prisoners in the Soviet Union should be released at once. General Sikorskihad shown a most admirable spirit in this discussion.The fact that these negotiations had taken place had become known, but it was hoped to avoid public discussion of the detailsthereof,The Foreign Secretary reported requests which had been madeto him by M. Maisky. He had informed the latter that theserequests would be reported to the Defence Committee.
German peace offensive.foreign secretary^Declaration.o123W.M. 66 (41).The Prime Minister invited attention to the important&apos;declara-tion made by the Foreign Secretary in his speech at Leeds on the5th July that we were not prepared to negotiate with Hitler at anytime on any subject. While this statement expressed the opinionof the whole War Cabinet, it was perhaps the most explicit public declaration on the subject which had been made. Such a declarationhad been necessary at this moment in order to forestall any peace offensive by Hitler in the near future.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of this declaration.Northern ,   6.   The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gaveIreland. an encouraging account of his visit to Northern Ireland.   In spiteVisit of Home of severe bombing, the spirit of the Belfast workers (e.g., at HarlandSecretary. and Wolffs) was admirable. The Northern Ireland Governmentwere anxious to be told of directions in which they could co-operate in the war effort. The new arrangement, whereby the NorthernIreland Minister of Commerce had assumed responsibility for theNorthern Ireland Area Board (of the Production Executive), seemed likely to prove a satisfactory arrangement.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Japan.JapaneseIntentions in indo-China.Strategic,Political andEconomicCounter-Action.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 19thConclusions,Minute 13.)7.   The War Cabinet had before them- (i) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (W.P. (41) 154) containing recommendations asto the strategic, political and economic counter-actionwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government might take in the eventof the Japanese seizing points oVappui in Indo-China.(ii) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (W.P. (41) 155) covering a Memorandum by theMinister of Economic Warfare, setting out the economicrestrictions against Japan which had been put into force as the result of decisions by the Far Eastern Committee.A comprehensive scheme of restrictions was now inoperation throughout the British Empire, with the collaboration of the Netherlands and the United states government.The Foreign Secretary asked for Cabinet authority to take themeasures set out in paragraph 5 of W.P. (41) 154 in the event offurther Japanese action in Indo-China. He did not at this stageask approval for the measures suggested in paragraph 6, which theNetherlands Government regarded as premature, before theJapanese had taken open action against British or Dutchpossessions.The Foreign Secretary also suggested that the DominionGovernments and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo, should be consulted as a matter of urgency as to whether they favoureddenunciation of the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911, soas to enable the Cabinet to take a rapid decision if the Japanesemoved in Indo-China.In discussion, it was agreed that the general situation did not justify us in taking strong deterrent measures to prevent furtherJapanese encroachments. Our. policy must therefore be, for thepresent, to take appropriate counter-action after each encroachment,calculated to play on Japanese reluctance to come into the war against an unbeaten and still formidable country.
As part of this policy, the Minister of Economic Warfare.suggested that the Far Eastern Committee should be instructed to intensify their study of possible economic restrictions against japan. .The War Cabinet-(1) Subject to the Chiefs of Staff notifying that they had noobjection, gave general approval to the line of policy outlined in W,P. (41) 154, and authorised the foreign secretary to proceed with the consultations outlined Qtherein, with the exception of the proposal in para-graph 6.(2) Took note, with approval, of W.P. (41) 155, and directedthe Far Eastern Committee to consider, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of economic warfare, the possibility of tightening - the screw stillfurther against Japan by means of increased economicrestrictions, even in the absence of further provocationby that country.Home Defence.ProposedLondon DefenceExercise.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 62ndConclusions,Minute 9.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Eeport from the HomeDefence Committee (W.P. (41) 152) setting out the implications andarrangements on the Civil side which the proposed London invasionexercise would entail.On the general question of the advantages to be secured by theexercise, it was explained that the Commander-in-Chief, home forces, was most anxious that the exercise should be held. he regarded the exercise as most necessary in order to test our arrangements and to gain practical knowledge of a number of points ofwhich we now had no experience. The Ministers in charge of theCivil Departments most concerned (the Minister of Home Security,the Minister of Health and the Minister of Food) supported thisview.On the other hand, it was urged that the scheme was open to considerable objections. The proposal to hold the exercise could notbe announced very far in advance, lest the enemy might takeadvantage of it. There was always a risk that the exercise mightbe mistaken for a real parachute landing and that casualties might occur. Again, the inconvenience caused would be very considerable and might well give rise to considerable dissatisfaction andcriticism. It was difficult to believe that the military authorities could not obtain adequate experience by a Staff exercise which wouldnot involve such widespread disturbance to the life of the metropolis.The following points were made in regard to the details of thescheme : (1) The Secretary of State for Air wished it to be recorded inthe Minutes that the scheme must not curtail the RoyalAir Force operational communication system.(2) The Minister of Health said that it Would be necessary tomake some special arrangements to ensure that hospitals1      got their milk supplies.The War Cabinet decided as follows: In view of the considerable volume of opinion against thescheme voiced in the War Cabinet, the matter should be examined at a Meeting of the Defence Committee (Opera-tions) which.. the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces,.        should be invited to attend.
125W.M. 66 (41).Pharmacy and 9.   Reference was made to this Bill, of which the SecondMedicine Bill.   Reading was to be taken on the following day.The Prime Minister asked whether consideration had beengiven to the inclusion in the Bill of a provision whereby the cost ofthe raw materials of patent medicines should be stated on the package.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and Minister of Healthexplained that the Purchase Tax on patent medicines brought in 3 million a year, and that the repeal of the stamp duties (whichwould cost  800,000) was inevitable. The scheme embodied in theBill had involved agreements with a very large number of authorities, and as a result it was hoped that the Bill would meet with little opposition. It was feared that it would almost certainly be impracticable to include in the Bill a provision on the lines suggested.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 7, 1941.

Very glad you have arrived safely.     Have talked toAnthony in Yorkshire about your No: 1 Twist.    You willalready have received War Office 76097 to Commander-in-chiefMiddle East which crossed yours.     Emyhasis of these two telegrams is somewhat different but we accept and indeedprefer yours.     Proceed accordingly in your relations with free French.2.     However you must not overlook the main point whichis to gain the Arab world by establishment and proclamationat earliest of Syrian independence in v/whatever form is most acceptable.    Your paragraph 3 of No: 1. Twist is far fromadequate.     Our policy is to give the Syrian Arabs independence,we are quite willing that the Free French should representthe interests of France and prove that among the nations ofEurope France is the favoured and privileged power in Syria.O-^r only British interests except ordinary trade are tokeep the Germans out and win the war.5.     From this point of view the Arabs bulk far morelargely in our minds than the Free French and there can be noquestion of any lengthy delay in negotiating treaties whichsatisfy them and convince them they have not merely exchanpeedone set of Frenchmen for another.     Catroux&apos;s proclamation&quot;says &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.    This should mean that within afew days of the Vichy French surrendering prompt and vigorousnegotiations should begin, and be pressed earnestly andswiftly to a conclusion.4,     Nothing in the above of course affects Britishmartial law which we need to.defend the country and keep outthe Germans.I have.no doubt you have all this in your mind.[Copies sent to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,Secretary of State for War, C.N.S., GVI*G*S.,C.A.S., Major Morton, Major A.H.

[This telegram is of particular secrecy and should&quot;be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on].TENDED DISTRIBUTIONSWAR CABINET DISTRIBUTION,From:   EGYPT.From   CAIRO   To   FOREIGN OFFICE,Sir M. Lamps on no. 1 Twist6th &quot;July,11941,D. 1.40 p.m. 6th July, 1941,R,   2,13 p,m.   6th July, 1941,wwwMOST IMMEDIATE flTWIST,Following for the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs from the Minister of State,MOST SECRET. .War Office telegram No. 75858 of 3rd July.I have examined this question in consultation /withHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and General Headquarters, middle east, and have reached the following conclusions.1.    The Civil Administration of Syria cannot becarried out satisfactorily if at all without the active co-operation of the French Civil officials.2.    This practical point is reinforced because wesupported General Catroux&apos;s proclamation which provided for him to assume the powers, responsibilities and duties ofFrance in the Levant and we must honour our word,3.  . The treaties to be negotiated between the represent-atives of Syria and the Lebanon will no doubt include a modification of the status and function of the French civil authorities.4.    The interest of the Commander-in-Chief can, i suggest, only be to maintain complete military control in syria not only in the present operations but so as to provide against civil disorders or any future enemy attacks.   Thiswill be secured by the continuation of British martial law which will mean that the French Administration can take no action which may affect the military situation without theconsent of the General Officer Commanding in Chief Palestine.
5.     The General Officer Commanding must have the absolute right to decide how long the maintenance of martial law is necessary and if you agree I intend to leave no doubt in de Gaulle1s and Catroux&apos;s minds that we are to he the solegauges of how long martial law is to continue irrespective of the circumstances.   This may,   in due course,   lead to.a clash of views with Catroux hut the immediate need is tosecure his continued friendly collaboration and to induce him &apos;to honour the declaration of independence.   This willnot be possible if we try to hold back on the question ofcivil aaministration06.    Liaison between the General Officer Commandingand the French Administration should be maintained by onemission.    This can nominally be a branch of the SpearsMission,   On all matters of policy it would be responsible to the General Officer Commanding but would have the rightof communication to the Mission m London,However, I recommend liberal and not niggardly approach to the civil question whilst making the most stringentconditions td safeguard military requirements.If you agree to these conclusions I propose to inform general de Gaulle and the Commander-in^-Chief.   Pleasetelegraph urgently as de Gaulle is planning to leave forBrazzaville on Tuesdayc
