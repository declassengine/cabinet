And the bulk of the others either bought theirseats for cash or had them freely handed over for services rendered to a trade union.&quot;. The War Cabinet agreed as follows : (i) The Home Secretary should make enquiries whether thearticle constituted a breach of the Privileges of theHouse of Commons,(ii) The Home Secretary should report to the War Cabinetwhether the article offended against the Defence Regula-tions; and. in consultation with the Lord President ofthe Council and the Minister of Information, he should consider whether it would be desirable to obtain further powers to deal with articles of this description.
naval operations.Shipping Losses.militar-yOperations.U.S.S.E.In the attack on the homeward-bound Gibraltar convoy, theenemy had lost one U-boat for certain and another almost certainly.Of the escort vessels, we had lost H.M.S. Cossack. If the weathercontinued bad, we should have difficulty in getting H.M.S. Ariguanito port.During the previous four days about 10,000 tons of shipping had been sunk by enemy action, and 18,000 tons damaged by marinecasualties.On balance, the developments during the last four days werenot unfavourable. There had been no change on the northernsectors and little change in the Kalinin area, despite very heavy fighting due to strong Russian counter-attacks. The enemy had captured Kharkov and were within 12 miles of Rostov. their attacks against the Crimea had been held. Weather in all sectorswas making the main roads very difficult and other roads almostimpassable. This, combined with other maintenance difficulties, wasimpeding the Germans in their efforts to exploit their successes.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Germany.german atrocities.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 101stConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the statements made by the Prime Minister and president roosevelt on the 25th October, expressing horror and condemnationof the German executions of innocent people in France and elsewhere.In the circumstances, he thought it was unnecessary to proceedwith the proposal for a joint declaration, more particularly as itwould be difficult to get an agreed text. The Australian Govern-ment had already criticised our draft as too strong.If our Allies should wish to issue statements on their own account, either jointly or separately, we need not object.The War Cabinet-Approved the course suggested by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.6. Arising out of the previous Minute, the Foreign Secretaryreferred to General de Gaulle &apos;s broadcast to the French nation onthe 25th October. The Foreign Secretary said that, while our own policy was to do nothing to discourage individual acts by citizens of the oppressed nations against their German oppressors, weshould not take steps to prevent the Heads of the Allied Govern-ments in this country from broadcasting messages to their own countries discouraging individual acts of this nature. We should,however, ask to be informed in advance of the line which the AlliedGovernments proposed to take on these occasions.The War Cabinet-Approved the line of policy suggested by the foreign secretary.a 7-   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theRmTm^L Foreign Secretary circulating a draft telegram to Lord Halifax andjuramania. the Dominion Governments on the proposal that we should declare(Previous war on Finland, Hungary and Roumania, and asking for theirEeference: observations (W.P.

U.S.S.R.Aid to Russia.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 94thConclusions,Minute 3.)Air Bases in the pacific.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 105thConclusions,Minute 4.)8. Arising out of the previous item, the War Cabinet had a discussion on aid to Russia. A record of the discussion, and of theconclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thismatter had been discussed at an inter-departmental meeting on the25th October. The Service Departments were in full agreementwith what was proposed. It appeared that the Australian Govern-ment had already been approached, and had given their assent. Asthe matter had now been under discussknvfor a long time, he hopedthat we could now inform the United States Ambassador that thescheme was agreed in principle, and that negotiations with the localofficials in the territories concerned could proceed.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was invitedto send a telegram to the New Zealand Governmentinviting their agreement to this proposal.(2) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was authorisedto inform the United States Ambassador that we were favourable to the proposal and were consulting the NewZealand Government as a matter of urgency.Production. 10.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the priority Chairman of the Production Executive (W.P. (G) (41) 97) in regardMachinery.       to the issue of a revised Priority Direction.In discussion, it was explained that no dispute arose as to thesubstance of the revised Direction, but that objection was seen bythe Minister of Supply to the Direction being issued on behalf ofall the Ministers who were members of the Production Executive.The Minister of Supply explained that he saw some objectionto the Direction on priorities being signed by as many as sixMinisters, seeing that the essential interests in priority questionsaffected only the three Production Ministers.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the functions of theProduction Executive included &apos;&apos; the allocation of available resources of raw materials, productive capacity, labour, &amp;c, and theestablishment of priorities where necessary.&quot;European States. This was another strong reason against thecourse proposed.The Foreign Secretary said that he himself favoured meetingthe Russian wishes in this matter.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that telegrams should be sent to Lord Halifax andto the Dominion Governments as proposed in W.P.(41) 248.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform the soviet ambassador that we saw considerable disadvantages indeclaring war on these three countries; that we were only prepared to consider this course in view of theirstrong pressure; but that we had addressed enquiries on the matter to the Governments of the United Statesand of the Dominions.
The Prime Minister said that, if, as seemed likely, there was afurther production debate before long, he would like to be able tosay definitely that questions of priority and allocation were settled by the Production Executive, on which all the Ministers concerned were represented.Further, the procedure whereby the Direction was signed by allthe Ministers represented on the Executive went some way to meetthe criticism that inconsistent priority Directions were issued from different Departments.In deference to these views, and on the understanding that theexisting functions of his Ministry in regard to machine tools andsteel were unaffected, the Minister of Supply withdrew his objection.The War Cabinet-Accordingly endorsed the proposals set out in the Memo-randum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.Mechanised 11.   The Lord President of the Council referred to the positionTransport of the Mechanised Transport Corps.   The Corps, which was aCorps. private organisation, had done good work, but it was now competing with the Auxiliary Services. Now that the State required a largenumber of women to enter one of the Auxiliary Services, a changein the organisation and status of the Corps was called for. Negotia-tions had already been started with Mrs. Cook, and he was proposing to see her this week and explain the Governments general attitude. Broadly, the proposal was that the Mechanised TransportCorps should retain its separate existence as a body in which olderwomen, who were unable to leave their homes, could give part-time service.The Corps had a number of influential supporters, and hethought that it would be right that Ministers should be informedgenerally of the position.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of this statement.Great George Street, S.W. 1,October 27, 1941.
