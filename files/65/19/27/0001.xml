(41) 85thConclusions,Minute 2.)naval operations.Shipping Losses.1.   The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 733-736 : Summary of aircraft losses since the 4th September : Home Theatre Enemy 14 destroyed.12 probable.7 damaged.Our Own 13 Fighters (2 Pilots safe).31 Bombers.Overseas Theatres Enemy 18 destroyed.14 probable.18 damaged.Our Own 6 destroyed.11 damaged (10 of this number having been damaged&apos;on the ground).On the previous night we had made our heaviest raid so far on berlin. Of 198 aircraft despatched, about 150 had actually reachedthe objective. Of the 20 aircraft missing during the night&apos;s opera-tions, 18 had been detailed for Berlin. Our bombers had destroyed2 enemy fighters and probably a third. A new incendiary bomb hadbeen used for the first time with success.That morning 4 Flying Fortress Bombers had been despatched to attack the A admiral Scheer at Oslo. Unfortunately, three of these machines had been lost, two of them owing to enemy action, the thirdhaving crashed on landing. An investigation into the matter wasbeing made.During the night of the 6th/7th September, when the enemy had attacked Abu Sueir and Ismailia, our night fighters had destroyed two enemy aircraft, plus one probable and one damaged.In home waters our aircraft had sunk three merchant vessels and one flak ship, and in the Middle East five merchant ships andone destroyer.  An enemy submarine had also probably been hit.In answer to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff said that, inaccordance with the Cabinet&apos;s decision, instructions had been given that there should be no indiscriminate high-altitude bombing overenemy-occupied friendly countries.MilitaryOperations.U.S.S.E.During the previous four days 20,000 tons of our shipping hadbeen sunk, including 12,000 by enemy air action. Aircraft haddamaged 13,000 tons. 107,000 tons of shipping had been sunkduring August.An enemy submarine had been sunk by a destroyer in the atlantic that morning.H.M. Cruisers Aurora and Nigeria had had an action with enemy forces in a Norwegian fiord on the previous morning, sinkingthe Bremse, a small destroyer, a trawler and one other vessel.North of Kiev the German pincer movements south fromChernigov and north-east from the bridgehead near Garnostaipolwere closing, though the Russians might well have been able to[22901] b 2
Middle East.withdraw the bulk of their forces from this salient. On the Dnieperthe Germans were thrusting north from the bridgehead atKrementsehug in the direction of Lubni, and might join up withthe German forces pressing south from Obolonje. They might thuscut off Russian troops in the Kiev sector.Neither the War Office nor the Air Ministry had any confirma-tion of the statement made by M. Stalin in his telegram to the PrimeMinister, dated the 3rd September, to the effect that 30-34 freshGerman divisions and a number of tanks and aircraft had beentransferred from the West to the Eastern Front.There had been more evidence that the Germans were planning a combined operation in the Black Sea. Two new German divisions had reached the Balkans from Germany.It was thought that an additional Italian motorised division hand arrived at Tripoli. There had also been an unconfirmed reportthat a Lorried Infantry Regiment of the German 5th armoured division had been issued with tropical equipment.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.United States of 2. The First Sea Lord gave particulars of the attack by aAmerica. U-boat on the United States destroyer Greer on the 4th September.German attacks on UnitedStates Ships.The Greer.Steel Seafarer. The Foreign Secretary referred to the sinking of the SteelSeafarer by enemy aircraft at the entrance to the Gulf of Suez onthe night of the 5th/6th September. Air blockade was unknown to international law, and the United States Government would appearto have a good case for demanding redress.Middle East. 3.   The War Cabinet discussed the military situation in the(Previous        Middle East.Reference: A full record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;sW.M. (41) 73rd Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Conclusions, The Prime Minister suggested that the part played by minute 2.)       Yugoslavia, and in particular General Simovitch, in delaying theYugoslavia.       German plan and making the Germans fight for their success shouldnot be overlooked.Encouraging references about Yugoslavia should be made inthe Press from time to time, and we should do everything possibleto re-equip Yugoslav forces which were fighting on our side.Persia. 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theNegotiations     Persian Government had not yet sent a definite reply to our demandswith the Persianthat the German community should be handed over to us. It lookedGovernment as though they were making every effort to spin out the discussions,regarding the xt would be very unsatisfactory if only a limited number of Germanshanding over of were rounded up, and the rest got away.Germans. Attention was drawn to Angora telegram No. 2176, which(Previous reported a German-threat that, if we interned the Germans in reference: Persia, Germany would intern British subjects in the Channel&quot;W.M. (41) 89th Islands. Doubts were expressed whether it was necessary to payConclusions, much attention to this communication, so far as our Persian policyMinute 2.)       was concerned. ^A discussion followed, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.
U.S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 90thConclusions,Minute 3.)The PrimeMinister&apos;s replyto M. Stalin&apos;message.Supplies.Aluminium.Need forincreasedproduction inthe UnitedKingdom.The MoscowMeeting;,(previous reference:W.M. (41) 87thConclusions,Minute 4.)Discussions onStrategy.5. The Prime Minister read the message (telegram No. 1202to Moscow) which he had sent in reply to M. Stalin&apos;s personal message (telegrams Nos. 1091, 1092 and 1093 from Moscow)regarding the present position on the Russian front.On the question of supplies, the message stated that we had never thought of requiring payment from the Soviet Government.Any assistance which we could&quot;give had better be on the same basisof comradeship as the Lease-Lend Bill.The Prime Ministers message was unanimously approved.A further message would be required in reply to M. Stalin&apos;request for 30,000 tons of aluminium at the beginning of October.This request bore no relation to realities. We had to determine how much aluminium we could make available for Russia, having regardto our available stocks, to the requirements of the Royal Air Force,and to the shipping situation.It was agreed in discussion that the Russian need was sopressing that the matter could not be left over for decision at theforthcoming meeting in Moscow. It might be possible, at some risk to our own position, to make 5,000 tons of aluminium available for russia in October. After that a smaller amount could be madeavailable monthly for, say, six months. The message to M. Stalinwould have to bring out the limiting factors in such a way as to convince M. Stalin that we were helping him to the utmost of our ability.The War Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister, in consultation with theMinister of Supply, to settle the terms of the reply to besent to M. Stalin&apos;s request for aluminium.Now that we were committed to sending supplies on a large scale to Russia, it was essential for the Supply Ministers and theMinister of Labour and National Service to start forthwith a campaign for increased production in this country.   Both sides ofindustry would have to put forth an additional effort to fill the gap in the supplies required by our own Armed Forces.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to state in the Houseof Commons that no time had been or would be lost in the despatchof our Mission, but that it must await the arrival of the UnitedStates delegates. In the meanwhile, important supplies were being dispatched to Russia. He would add that the Minister of supply would take charge of all non-diplomatic Missions in Moscow.The Minister of Supply undertook to supply the PrimeMinister with a list of the personnel accompanying him to Moscow.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to moscow telegram No. 1109. It seemed undesirable to rule out inadvance all discussion of strategical matters at the Moscow Meeting.It was suggested in discussion that it would be unnecessary tosend special representatives, to Moscow to discuss strategy.  General.Ismay could refer home for instructions if the Russians raisedstrategical points on which he or our Mission in Moscow neededguidance. &apos;The War Cabinet-Agreed that strategical matters could not be ruled out inadvance from discussion at the Moscow Meeting, but that special representatives need not accompany, the Missionfor this purpose.
atlantic charter.Interpretation ofPoint III.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 89thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Prime Minister read the draft of the statement whichhe proposed to make on the first day of the Session on Point III ofthe Atlantic Charter.He undertook to consider certain further amendments suggested by the Secretary of State for India and Burma.The War Cabinet-Approved the general lines of the proposed statement.[A copy of the statement, as made by the Prime Minister in theHouse of Commons on the 9th September, 1941, is appended to these conclusions.]Mexico.(previous reference :W.M. (41) 87thConclusions,Minute 3.)Resumption ofDiplomaticRelations and settlement ofthe Oil Dispute.7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (41) 215) proposing that His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Washington should be instructed to inform the State Department that we were preparedto consider favourably the resumption of diplomatic relations withMexico. It was not considered practicable to make this step con-ditional on the British oil companies obtaining broadly the same terms as the American oil companies, but the Embassy would ask the State Department for the fullest possible information as to thekind of settlement which they were imposing on the american companies.The President of the Board of Trade and the Secretary for petroleum reminded the War Cabinet that our oil interests inMexico were three times as large as those of the United States.The United States settlement with Mexico would probably include a large loan, out of which the American oil companies wouldindirectly be compensated. As we could not give a similar loan, it did not look as though the American negotiations would be of muchuse to us. In these circumstances, ought we not to maintain ourpresent policy of making the resumption of diplomatic relationsdependent upon a settlement on lines reasonably satisfactory to ourselves ?The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that we ought not to sacrifice the British companies. The prospects of theirobtaining a satisfactory settlement ought to improve after we hadresumed diplomatic relations with Mexico, since we might hope to benefit by the good offices of the United States Government in ourown oil negotiations.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toproceed on the lines of paragraphs 3 and 8 of W.P. (41) 215,subject to its being made clear to the United StatesGovernment that, while hoping that we may count on theUnited States Governments assistance in our negotiationswith the Mexican Government, we will not necessarilyaccept the same terms as the United States oil companies.8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (G) (41) 90), in which it waspointed out that there was no legal sanction for the &apos;&apos; advice &apos;&apos; givenby the Petroleum Department that motorists receiving supplemen-holding Supple- tary petrol rations should keep a log of their journeys. &quot;The Lordmentary Petrol Presidents Committee recommended the making of an OrderRations. empowering the Minister to direct that specified classes of motoristsshould keep specified records. Some motorists were already keepinglogs, and the Petroleum Department had called on a percentage of applicants to produce their logs in connection with the issue offurther supplementary rations.Petroleum.Recording ofJourneys byMotorists
In discussion, the assurance was given that it was not intendedto create a new punishable offence. The requirement to keep a logwould not be universal. The police would have no authority to stopmotorists on the road and ask them to produce their logs.The War Cabinet accepted the recommendations of theLord Presidents Committee as set out in W.P. (G) (41) 90.The Blackout.Report of Inter -DepartmentalCommittee.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 87thConclusions,Minute 9.)Parliament.Detention of aMember underDefenceRegulation 18B.9. The War Cabinet approved the Eeport of the Inter-Departmental Committee (W.P. (G) (41) 91).10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (W.P. (41) 213) stating that he had received repre-sentations to the effect that there was a strong feeling in the Houseof Commons that, if a Member were detained under Eegula-tion 18b, he ought to be given a right to have his case investigated by a Committee of the House rather than by the existing AdvisoryCommittee.The War Cabinet-Accepted the recommendation of the Home Secretary(W.P. (41) 213) that the existing procedure should remain unaltered.Great George Street, S.W. 1,September 8, 1941.
APPENDIX.Point III of the Atlantic Charter.Extract from Statement by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons,September 9, 1941 (Hansard, Cols. 68-69).[See Minute 6.]THE purpose of the Joint Declaration, signed by President Roosevelt and myself on the 12th August, is stated in the Preamble to be : &quot; To make known certain common principles in the national policies ofour respective countries on which they base their hopes for a better future for the world.&quot;No words are needed to emphasise the future promise held out to the world by such a Joint Declaration by the United States and Great Britain. I need onlydraw attention, for instance, to the phrase in paragraph 6 &quot; after the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny &quot;to show the profound and vital character of the solemn agreement into which wehave jointly entered. Questions have been asked, and will no doubt be asked, asto exactly what is implied by this or that point, and explanations have been invited. It is a wise rule that when two parties have agreed a statement one ofthem shall not, thereafter, without consultation with the other, seek to put specialor strained interpretations upon this or that passage . I propose, therefore, to speak to-day only in an exclusive sense.First, the Joint Declaration does not try to explain how the broad principlesproclaimed by it are to be applied to each and every case, which will have to bedealt with when the war comes to an end. It would not be wise for us, at this moment, to be drawn into laborious discussions on how it is to fit all the manifoldproblems with which we shall be faced after the war. Secondly, the joint declaration does not qualify in any way the various statements of policy whichhave been made from time to time about the development of constitutional govern-ment in India, Burma or other parts of the British Empire. We are pledged bythe Declaration of August, 1940, to help India to obtain free and equal partner-ship in the British Commonwealth with ourselves, subject, of course, to the fulfil-ment of obligations arising from our long connection with India and our responsibilities to its many creeds, races and interests. Burma also is covered by our considered policy of establishing Burmese self-government and by themeasures already in progress. At the Atlantic meeting, we had in mind,primarily, the restoration of the sovereignty, self-government and national life of the States and nations of Europe now under the Nazi yoke, and the principles governing any alterations in the territorial boundaries which may have to be made.So that is quite a separate problem from the progressive evolution of self-governing institutions in the regions and peoples which owe allegiance to theBritish Crown. We have made declarations on these matters which are complete in themselves, free from ambiguity and related to the conditions and circum-stances of the territories and peoples affected. They will be found to be entirely in harmony with the high conception of freedom and justice which inspired theJoint Declaration.
