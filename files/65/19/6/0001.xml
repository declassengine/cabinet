The Future of The War Cabinet had a discussion on the future of thethe Railways, railways, and had before them a Memorandum by the lord president of the Council (W.P. (41) 158) summarising the issues which had arisen in discussions in the Lord Presidents Committee.The discussion was of a preliminary nature, and no final decisions were reached on the main issues raised in the lord presidents Memorandum. The general trend of the discussion, andthe procedure agreed upon for handling the issues involved, were asfollows: (1) The determining consideration must be to ensure the fullesteffort from the railways during the war.(2) The prevailing view was that a declaration at this stage infavour of unification after the war, if not immediatelyfollowed by steps to make it effective, would result in theState getting the worst of both worlds. Further, it was clearly undesirable to make any declaration in general terms in favour of unification until a specific scheme hadbeen worked out and approved.(3) The Minister of War Transport was invited to circulate tothe War Cabinet his proposals as already submitted tothe Lord Presidents Committee for a revision of theRailway Control Agreement.(4) The Minister was also invited to submit a Paper setting outthe proposed changes in the control and higher organi-sation of the railways. This Paper should deal with thefollowing points raised in discussion : (a) The extent to which, the scheme proposed would secure unified operational control during the war.(b) What steps would be taken to ensure that theRailway Managers regarded themselves as having an undivided responsibility to the Ministry ofWar Transport for the efficient functioning ofthe railways, in the interests of the State ?(c) What  functions  would  the  Board  of  RailwayDirectors perform under the Ministers scheme?Would they have any effective influence on day-to-day railway management ?(d) Was it clear that the Minister of War transport had all the powers required to ensure that therailways were operated in the interests of the, State, and to secure the maximum war effortduring the control period?Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 15, 1941.
