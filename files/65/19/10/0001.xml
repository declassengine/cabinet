The Railways.Control and higher -Organisation.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 70thConclusions.)1. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of War Transport (W.P. (41) 173) dealing with the points raised in the discussion at the Meeting noted in the margin.The following were the main points in discussions (1) Financial Issues. The net pool profit of the railways hadbeen  22^ millions in the first half of the year, notwith-standing that the Government had not agreed to anyrecent variation in rates, fares and charges to meetincreases in working costs arising from the war. this might make it more difficult to reach a settlement on thebasis set out in paragraph 10 of the Appendix to theMinisters Memorandum.(2) Promotions in the Railway Service. The Minister saidthat he did not propose to interfere with the present procedure. whereby the Boards dealt with promotionsor such matters as welfare. There was a provision whereby all senior appointments were submitted to theMinistry for approval before they were made, and couldbe varied if the Minister so directed. In the Minister&apos;view, there was advantage in continuing the present arrangement whereby the Boards dealt with thesematters. His (the Ministers) powers extended to super-vision of all promotions, if he thought fit. He could alsosecure the dismissal of any person from the railways,provided, of course, that there were adequate grounds.(3) Doubts were expressed by the Lord Privy Seal as to the wisdom of the Boards of Directors retaining anyfunctions other than those of allocating to the share-holders the sums derived from the proposed fixedpayment. He feared that the retention of any such functions would still leave the Railway Directors in theposition of serving two masters.(4) The Lord President of the Council said that, while therewas advantage in the Boards of Directors continuing todeal with permanent appointments, it was clear that theMinister must retain complete control over the postingsof all railway officials who filled responsible positions.There might be something to be said for introducing onthe railways the same practice as had been adopted inthe Civil Service, namely, that for the war all appoint-ments were on an &quot; Acting &apos;&apos; basis. So far, however, as permanent appointments by way of promotion continuedto be made, there was much to be said for not scrappingthe existing machinery.(5) The Minister of War Transport said that, while he thoughtit would be in the public interest to allow the Boards tocontinue to exercise duties in regard to promotions and welfare, if those duties were exercised in a way whichwas not consistent with the maximum war effort, hewould not allow the Boards to continue to perform thoseduties.(6) It was urged that, while the governing factor in deter-mining what measures should be introduced during thewar must be the maintenance of the maximum war effort,certain matters (which might in certain cases have been&quot; &quot; questions of Party political controversy) might have tobe dealt with during the war%as the basis for post-war reconstruction. One of these matters might be there organisation of our national transport system,includingroad: transport as-well as railways.   The
immediate decision should not prejudice the considera-tion of any scheme put forward on this basis as part ofthe problem of post-war reconstruction.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (I) The War Cabinet took note that the scheme for the organi-sation of the Railways during the war put forward bythe Minister of War Transport included provision forthe following points : (a) That the Ministry would possess all the powersrequired to ensure the operation of the railways in the interests of the State.(b) That the general managers would act as the agents for the Minister in a centralised system ofrailway operation under his general direction and control.(c) That, while it was proposed that the Boards of directors should continue to exercise certainfunctions in regard to, e.g., promotions and welfare, the Minister would exercise strict super-vision over all higher appointments, and, if itshould appear that the Boards exercised any oftheir functions in regard to personnel in a manner detrimental to our war effort, the system would be changed.(II) Subject to the above assurances, the scheme for the controland higher organisation of the Railways, set out in theMinisters Memorandum, was approved as an interimworking arrangement during the control period.(III) The War Cabinet agreed that this decision did not prejudice consideration by them, at a later date, of any scheme for the reorganisation of our national transport system (including the Railways) which might be putforward, either as a measure of reconstruction after thewar or as an essential measure which must be taken during the war, in preparation for reconstruction afterthe war.(IV) The Minister of War Transport was authorised to proceedwith negotiations with the Railway Companies for theconclusion of a new Agreement whereby the companies should be remunerated by a fixed payment. The amountof this payment should be determined On the basis of thefigures set out in paragraph 10 of the Appendix to his memorandum.Russo-PolishNegotiations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 72ndConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the WarCabinet the latest draft of the Polish-Soviet Treaty^and the accom-accompanying  Protocol?&quot; This draft had been agreed by the SovietGovernment, but had not yet been accepted by the Polish Govern-ment. He asked whether the War Cabinet would authorise him to write on their behalf to General Sikorski to say that, in their view,the conclusion of a Treaty on these lines would be in the interestsof Poland.If agreement was reached and a Treaty was signed, he also proposed to give to the Polish Government, at the time of signature,an assurance, for which they were pressing, that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment did not recognise territorial changes affecting Polandmade since August 1939. [This went no further than what we hadalready so often said, namely, that we did not recognise changes made by force.]r &apos;

PROTOCOL.

1) All practical questions concerning the release of the Polish citizens who are now detained on the territory of the U.S.S.R. will be considered in a positive spirit after the restoration of diplomatic relations between the U.S.S.R. and Poland.

2) The various reciprocal claims of a public, as well as of a private, nature will be considered in the subsequent negotiations between the two Governments.

3) The present Protocol comes into force simultaneously with the Agreement of the July, 1941.
