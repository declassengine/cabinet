Naval, Military 1.   The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in*w Air amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 768-771 :-Operations.Summary of aircraft losses since the 10th October : Home Theatre (previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 100thConclusions,Minute 3.)Air Operations.naval operations.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.U.S.S.E.Enemy 13 destroyed.3 probable.2 damaged.Our Own 2 Fighters.3 Coastal Command.23 Bombers.&apos;Overseas Theatre Enemy 1 probable.3 damaged.Our Own 7 destroyed.4 damaged.On the previous night we had sent over Germany a larger number of bombers than ever before. The bombing of Nuremberghad been particularly successful.Our aircraft claimed to have hit 9 merchant vessels, 4 flak ships and 1 auxiliary in Home Waters and 10 merchant vessels in theMediterranean. Out of one convoy in the Mediterranean our aircraft had claimed 2 ships sunk and 2 damaged. Threepromising attacks on submarines had also been made, and that morning a U-boat had been brought to the surface and was still under observation.During the previous four days a total of 13,000 tons of shipping had been sunk and 8,000 damaged.The Germans occupied a semi-circle around Leningrad about12 miles from the city. Their intention appeared to be to await the surrender of the city. In the Central Sector the Germans were making their greatest effort.  This effort was in three directions : (i) Immediately north of the road Smolensk-Moscow,(ii) From   Roslavl   towards   Vyazma thereafter   probablyMoscow,(iii) Glukhov-Orel-Tula.The attacks had already achieved considerable success. TheNorthern and Central thrusts had effected a junction north-west ofVyazma, and a further advance to Moscow had already begun. Thesouthern attack had now passed Orel, leaving behind it largepockets of Russians north and south of Bryansk. These pincermoves had by-passed large forces of Marshal Timoshenko&apos;s Armyand the Germans claimed 200,000 prisoners. In the Ukraine theGermans had occupied a large area north-west of Kharkov, and had made a new thrust towards Lozovaja. Further south they had reached the vicinity of Taganrog. In the Melitopol area theGermans claimed 60,000 prisoners. The German attack across thePerekop Isthmus had made no further progress.The Germans were now advancing steadily on most sectors ofthe front from Smolensk to the Black Sea, and it seemed that thenext few days might decide the fate of Moscow.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.[23010]
B.B.C. 2.   In connection with an inaccurate statement broadcast byProposals for the B.B.C. as lo the Moscow Conference (see Telegram No. 1279reorganisation, from Moscow^ the Minister of Information undertook to circulate(Previous to the War Cabinet a paper showing the present organisation ofEeference: the B.B.C. and what it would be after the intended reorganisationW.M. (40) 3llth had taken place.Conclusions,Minute 8.)Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 100thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Minister of Home Security reported that on theprevious night enemy bombing had been widespread in lancashire and Yorkshire, but not on a heavy scale. Thirteen people had been killed at Oldham and 200 rendered homeless. The total casualtiesreported for the night had been 18 killed and 123 seriously injured.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Parliament.Publicity inregard to th*time and placeof Meetings.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 245thConclusions,Minute 2.)Parliament.future arrangements.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 69thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. After a short discussion as to whether the time and placeof meetings of Parliament should be made public beforehand, theWar Cabinet agreed To adhere to the present practice whereby such informa-tion was not published in advance.5. The War Cabinet had a short discussion as- to whetherParliament should adjourn for a fortnight towards the end of thismonth.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that such an adjournment was most desirable, and took note that the Party Leaders would endeavour tosecure its ready acceptance.(2) Agreed that, in this event, the present Session should bebrought to an end on the 11th November and a new session begun on the following day.Palestine.Eecruitment of jewish units for Service inthe british army.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 99thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (G) (41) 105 (Revise)).The main points in this Memorandum, which set out the results of consultations with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, theMinister of State and the Secretary of State for War, were asfollows : (i) While the raising of Jewish contingents, partly in the, United States, would be open to some political objection,the matter should be decided on military grounds.(ii) The Secretary of State for War opposed the schemestrongly on military grounds, namely, that, in thepresent Supply situation, we could not spare equipment for troops of doubtful value.(iii) As   an   alternative   to   refusal,   we   might   acceptDr. Weizmann&apos;s offer if war service of a different kind could be substituted, e.g., technical personnel of various types for which there was an unsatisfied demand for war purposes.f    spy   adkt
U.S.S.R.The moscow conference.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 100thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Ministerof Supply, as Chairman of the British Mission to the moscow conference (W,P. (41) 238).The War Cabinet-(i) Took note, with approval, of the Report by the Chairmanof the British Mission to the Moscow Conference(W.P. (41) 238).The following were the main points made in discussion : (1) It was not possible to defer a decision again. Indeed,Dr. Weizmann had said that he would prefer a definiterefusal to further postponement.(2) It was, of course, open to Jews to enlist in American,Canadian or British Units, and many had done so. Butit was understandable that the Jews, who had been soharshly attacked by Nazi Germany, should wish to seespecifically Jewish units raised.(3) Although Dr. Weizmann and his supporters were not nowasking that the proposed Jewish Units should be stationed in Palestine, this demand was certain to comelater on. Some of Dr. WeizmamVs supporters, indeed,hardly, troubled to disguise the fact that a Jewish army would be useful after the war in securing a settlementof the Palestinian question on Zionist lines.(4) Nevertheless, on balance there was much to be said for meeting the present demand by increasing the enrolmentof Jews in Palestine. The Secretary- of State for theColonies said that the rule formerly in force, wherebyparity was maintained between Arabs and Jews in the recruitment of the Palestinian Forces, had been changed.No limit was now imposed. There were to-day 17,000Jews in the Palestine Police and Defence Forces.(5) To carry this process further would not involve us in anyserious political difficulties; it would save transporta-tion; and it had the strong logical justification that itwould be wrong to refuse the Palestinian Jews themeans to defend themselves if the war reached Palestine.(6) It must not be taken as certain that the recruitment of jewish Units for general service would meet with afavourable political reception in the United States. Inany case, the Palestinian Jews were a better field of recruitment.The War Cabinet-(a) Decided against the adoption of a scheme for the recruit-ment of Jewish Units for general service on the linessummarised in paragraph 3 of W.P. (G) (41) 105.(b) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to encourage the enrolment of additional Palestinian Jews up to, say,5,000 to 10,000 men, in the military and police forcesin Palestine primarily for purposes of local defence. if practicable, it would be desirable that a few purelyJewish units should be formed, provided that this couldbe done without undue publicity.(c) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, when com-communicating this decision to Dr. Weizmann, to inform him that the three Defence services in this country werein urgent need of skilled technical personnel, and thatwe should welcome the help to our war effort whichwould result from the recruitment of Jewish technicians.
(ii) Placed on record their gratitude to the Chairman and theother members of the British Mission for their successfulhandling of the negotiations.(iii) Invited the Minister of Supply and the Secretary of Statefor Air to consult together on the proposal made by theformer that an officer or officers should be sent out bythe Air Ministry to the United States to consult withthe United States authorities as to the type of bombers to be sent from the United States to Russia. [unless this course was adopted, there was a risk of renewedagitation for the despatch of heavy bombers from theUnited States to Russia.](iv) Took note that the Prime Minister would settle whether any modifications were necessary in the organisationrequired to co-ordinate the despatch of supplies toRussia.U.S.S.R.Anglo-SovietBelations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 67thConclusions.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto M. Stalin&apos;s statement during the Moscow negotiations that hewould like to see relations between our country and his placed on amore permanent and satisfactory basis.The War Cabinet-Took note that the Foreign Secretary would ask the soviet ambassador  to give us  a  clear  indication of  what. Stalin had in mind.Poland.Equipment of polish Forces inU.S.S.E.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 93rdConclusions,Minute 4.)9. The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that theSoviet Government had now agreed to General Sikorski paying a visit to Russia.The Secretary of State gave further information on the subjectof the equipment of the Polish forces in the U.S.S.R. (seeEnclosure VII to W.P. (41) 238).The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toinform the Soviet Government that, so far as GreatBritain was concerned, it would be easier for us to equipthe Polish forces if these were placed on the left of theRussian line, as near as possible to the Persian frontier.Fighting 10.   The Minister of Pensions referred to claims which hadServices. been put forward for increases in the pay of the Fighting Services.Pay and Investigation had shown that, while there was no general demandDependants&apos; for an increase in pay, concessions were needed to meet cases of allowances.       genuine hardship.(Previous It was accordingly proposed to recast the special allowancesReference:        known as War Service Grants.   The underlying principle of theW.M. (40) 251st revision was to fix a minimum standard of maintenance afterConclusions,      reasonable commitments had been met, below which a Service man&apos;sMinute 4.)        family should not be allowed to fall during his service.   The unitfor this purpose was 16s. for an adult and Ss. for a child.  A wifewith two children under school-leaving age would get two units, or32s. a week, after meeting reasonable commitments in respect of rent, rates, insurance premiums, hire purchase instalments, &amp;c.The maximum rate of grant was increased from  2 to  3, exclusive of any allowances paid by the Service Departments. under theirregulations.Under the existing rules for the assessment of war servicegrants, a member of the Forces was expected to contribute to his family a weekly sum which, during the earlier period of his service,
Man-Power.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 71stConclusions,Minute 6.)left him with little or no increase in the amount available for hisown use as a result of proficiency or promotion. The War servicegrant would in future be calculated on the assumption that the family received only the amount of the qualifying allotment laiddown for Army cases until the man&apos;s total pay exceeded 4s. a day,including his war pay of 6^. a day. Above that point it was reasonable that the man should contribute to his family 4/7ths ofany addition to his pay, retaining the remaining 3/7ths for his personal use.It was also proposed to make a concession in regard to free travel railway warrants for members of the Forces. At the presenttime there were four normal periods of privilege leave in the year.Service personnel received two free railway warrants. It was proposed to increase this to four free warrants for privilege leave a year. The cost of all these concessions represented about 10 millions a year.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe would like to consider whether this scheme would have anyrepercussion on Civil Defence personnel. The Chancellor of theExchequer thought that this was unlikely.The War Cabinet-(1) Gave approval in principle to the scheme outlined by theMinister of Pensions, and agreed that a White paper setting out the arrangements proposed should be pre-sented to the House in time for the Debate on Thursday,the 16th October.(2) Invited the Minister of Pensions to make a statement inthe House of Commons, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, in regard to the revised arrangements.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister had invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to consider whether some arrangement could be introduced in regard to service personnel, comparable to the arrangement whereby partof the Income Tax paid by workmen in munition factories earning high wages was set aside as a post-warcredit.11. The Prime Minister referred to the need for strongerpowers to secure the necessary women recruits for the Services.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he had it in mind to deal with this question as part of the general revisionof powers which would probably be necessary when the man-powersurvey had been completed.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Great George Street, S.W. 1,October 13, 1941.

Cripps.No. 127911th October, 1941.D. 12.25 p,m., 11th October, 194-1.R.     2.20 p.m., 11th october , 1941.3 5 5MOST IMMEDIATE.British Broadcasting Corporation at 6.15 G.M.T. thismorning Pacific transmission referring to return ofLord Beaverbrook and Mr. Harriman stated, on what appearedto be their authority:(a) that military supplies and raw material were&quot;being supplied to Russia on Lease and. Lend termsCb) that Great Britain and America were going tosatisfy everything asked for by Russians.2.    Both these statements are to the best of my&quot;belief quite false.    As to (a) raw materials are being paid for in full under the terms of the agreement ofAugust 6th,     As to (b) many demands could not he met infull and as to many more it was left to see what couldbe done after the return of the delegations.5.     Nothing could be more unfortunate than to make these exaggerated statements which are untrue.     Result ofthe conference was quite successful enough to stand onits own legs without these supports and I am at a loss to know how to explain these statements.4,     If I am askedf am I to say that raw materialwill in future be supplied on Lease and Lend terms orami to say that the statement given out was an unfortunate mistake and will be corrected?(individual)
