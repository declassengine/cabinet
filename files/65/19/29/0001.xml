precluded for varying periods, although rains and thaws in theautumn and heavy snowfalls in winter might stop operations insome sectors for three or four weeks at a time.Middle East. During the night of the 13th/14th September our patrols fromTobruk. Tobruk had intensified their activities and carried out a number of successful raids. In retaliation for these raids, a strong enemyforce, supported by a number of tanks, had overrun one of ourlistening-posts. Three German tanks employed in this operationhad been captured and the enemy concentration dispersed byartillery fire. In the frontier area two enemy columns, which contained armoured fighting vehicles, had carried out a recon-naissance, but had been engaged by our mechanised forces, whichhad inflicted considerable damage and loss upon them. . The enemycolumns had then withdrawn.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.U.S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M.

The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a personal message from M. Staling in reply to a message which he had sent tohim a week earlier.The message also dealt with the suggestion that compensation should be given to the Soviet at the end of the war if they had to sink their. Baltic Fleet.It was suggested that this might be dealt with by a transfer tothem of enemy vessels.The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to advise thePrime Minister as to the reply to be returned to this partof M. Stalin&apos;s message.3. A discussion took place, which is recordedSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.in  the4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatGeneral Sikorski had informed him that, during the Russianoccupation of Poland, the Poles had been very badly treated by theRussians while in prison. Since the Russo-Polish Agreement,which had led to their release from prison, the Poles had been very well treated by the Russians, who were now anxious to create a polish Army.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Persia.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (41) 92ndConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The War Cabinet were given the latest information as todevelopments in Persia and our future policy. This is recorded inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.
Afghanistan.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 71stConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theForeign Secretary (W.P. (41) 219) on the question whether weshould declare war on Finland, Hungary and Roumania. In his view, the arguments against declaring war on the last two countries were conclusive. As regards Finland, he recommended that weshould neither threaten nor issue a declaration of war unlessstrongly pressed by the Soviet Government.General agreement was expressed with the view that we shouldnot declare war on Hungary or Roumania at this juncture, as thiswould serve no useful purpose.As regards Finland, the Prime Minister thought that, by a threat of war, we might achieve something. He thought we should indicate to Finland that continued invasion of Russia by Finnishforces must inevitably lead to a declaration of war by us.The Foreign Secretary suggested that this might be donethrough the Norwegian Legation in Finland. But instead of simplythreatening to declare war, which would amount to nothing, itwould be more effective to tell Finland that we should also treat heras an enemy and ally of Germany when peace comes to be made.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that theSocial Democratic Party in Finland had been greatly affected bythe shooting of the Trade Union leaders in Norway. He suggestedthat it was important to make contact with the leaders of theFinnish Social Democratic Party, even if this meant sending aspecial emissary to Sweden for the purpose.The Prime Minister thought that we should follow up the linesof approach suggested by the Foreign Secretary and by the Ministerof Labour and National Service.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that we should not declare war against Roumaniaor Hungary at this juncture.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to convey to the finnish government, through the Norwegian Government, theview that, if they were to continue the invasion ofRussia, this, in the long run, could only lead to ourtreating Finland as an open enemy both now and at themaking of peace.Finland,Hungary and roumania.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 92ndConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Prime Minister referred to a telegram received fromHis Majesty&apos;s Minister in Kabul (No. 308 of the 11th September),and said that he thought more drastic action against the germans in Afghanistan should be taken than was proposed. Now was thetime to clean up the position.The Secretary of State for India said that there was no largenumber of Germans in Afghanistan and that the Afghan Govern-ment was favourable to us. Further, the telegram referred to from our Minister at Kabul had crossed a telegram sent from thiscountry giving the latest information available to us. Further, if our demands were not accepted, we only had it in mind to applyeconomic sanctions. In the circumstances, he suggested that theright course would be to defer a decision until (a) the views of theGovernment of India had been received on the telegram from Kabulof the 11th September; (b) His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul had had time to reply to our telegram giving him the latest information.The War Cabinet agreed to the course proposed by theSecretary of State for India at &quot; X.&quot;
(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consult with the Ministerof Labour and National Service as to means of makingcontact with leaders of the Finnish Social DemocraticParty.(4) Invited the Minister of Information to suggest to the TradeUnion Congress that, at their meeting to be held in thefollowing week, they should pass a resolution con-demning the shooting of Trade Union leaders in Norway.The western front.proposed publication ofLord Gort&apos;sDespatches.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 92nd.Conclusions,Minute 13.)8. The War Cabinet, after hearing the views of the ministers who had been invited to read the Despatches, agreed to theirpublication by the Secretary of State for War, subject to a shortinterval to allow a commentary on them to reach the DominionGovernments.The Minister of Information was invited to take steps to seethat the B.B.C. did not give undue prominence to these Despatches.Home Defence.ProposedLondon DefenceExercise.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 62ndConclusions,Minute 9.)9. The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet that inJune last the War Cabinet had considered the proposal for a large-scale Exercise to test plans for the defence of London against an air-borne attack. Doubts had been expressed about the scheme, anda decision had been deferred.The Chiefs of Staff no longer wished to hold the Exercise this autumn, but felt that the project should not be abandonedaltogether.The Prime Minister said that it should be an instruction to all departments concerned in the preparations against invasion thatour defences and preparations should continue throughout thewinter, and that Departments should be prepared to carry out alarge-scale Exercise in the early spring. He invited ministers concerned to give the necessary instructions to their Departments.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of this statement.Free France.General de gaulle.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 88thConclusions,Minute 7.)10. The Prime Minister said he had had a long talk withGeneral de Gaulle on Friday, the 12th September. He gave the WarCabinet a short account of the interview, a written record of whichwould be circulated. Perhaps the main point of interest was theproposal to form a Council for the Free French Movement.There could now be some relaxation in the attitude of cautionwhich had been enjoined upon Departments in their relations withthe Free French.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Great George Street, S. W. 1,September 15, 1941.
PRIME /MJNISTER^/^PER SOU A1 TELECRAMr GENERAL ISMAV. SERIAL No.......iXlXL^ S &apos; &quot;V force.O.S. Committee?)Personal Message.I. Stalin to Mr. Winston Churchill.In my last message I stated the viewpoint ofthe Soviet Government that the establishment of asecond front is the most fundamental remedy for improvement of the situation with regard to our common cause.   In reply to your message, in which you stress once more the impossibility of a second front at the present moment, I can only reiteratethat the absence of a second front simply favoursthe designs of our common enemy.I have no doubt that the British Governmentdesires to see the Soviet Union victorious and islooking for ways and means to attain this end.   If,as they think, the establishment of a second front in the West is at present impossible - perhapsanother method could be found to render to theSoviet ...

Soviet Union an active military help?It seems to me, that Great Britain couldwithout any risk land in Archangel 25-30 divisionsor transport them across Iran to the Southernregions of the U.S.S.R.   In this way there could he established military collauoration between theSoviet and British troops on the territory or theU.S.S.E,      A similar situation existed during thelast war in France.   The arrangement just mentioned would constitute a great help.   Itwould be a serious blow against the Hitleraggression,I thank you very much for your promise torender us assistance by the monthly deliveries of aluminium, tanks and aircraft,I can only welcome the intention of theBritish Government to render this assistance inaluminium, tanks and aircraft not on the usualcommercial basis, but on the basis of comradeshipand .,,

- - -and collaboration.   I hope the British Governmentwill have ample opportunity of being convinced thatthe Soviet Government understands how to appreciate the help received from its Ally.One remark in connection with the memorandumdelivered on September 12th to M. Molotov by theBritish Ambassador in Moscow Sir Stafford Crips,In this memorandum it is said: &quot;If the SovietGovernment would be compelled to destroy  its naval vessels at Leningrad in order to prevent their falling into the enemy hands, H.M.G. would recognise afterthe war claims of the Soviet Government to a certaincompensation from H.M.G. for the restoration of thevessels destroyed&quot;.The Soviet Government understands andappreciates the readiness of the British Government tomake partial compensation for the damaged sustained by the Soviet Union in case the Soviet vessels atLeningrad would actually be destroyed.   there could ...

Kremlin.1*3 o 9*41.could be no doubt that such a course will beadopted should the necessity arise.   However theresponsibility for this damage would be not Britain&apos;but Germany^.   I think therefore that the damageafter the war should be made good at the expenseof Germany.STALIN.
