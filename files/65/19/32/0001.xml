OFree France.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 93rdConclusions,Minute 10.)2. The War Cabinet were given particulars of certain diffi-culties which had arisen between General de Gaulle and Admiral Muselier. It was hoped that the matter had now been settled. Buta message, handed in during the Meeting, seemed to show that these difficulties had not been completely overcome.The Foreign Secretary said that General de Gaulle had now put forward the names of the proposed Council for the Free FrenchMovement. He now proposed to allot portfolios to the various members of the Council, which rather gave to it the appearance of aGovernment. This went somewhat beyond the suggestion made bythe Prime Minister in his interview with General de Gaulle.While the General had not included in his Council one or two peoplewhom we should like to have seen included, he thought that the list (which was read out to the War Cabinet) was a reasonable one and that we need not take exception to it.The Prime Minister emphasised the extreme importance of notallowing any public mention in the Press of differences in the free french Movement. The Movement was of the utmost importance,but its influence might suffer seriously if there was a split.The War Cabinet took note of these statements and invited (1) The Foreign Secretary to see General de Gaulle and admiral Muselier that night.(2) The Minister of Information to take steps to ensurethat no mention of these differences was made in thePress, and that the Council was not announced untilthe dispute had been settled.The Allies.Meeting ofAllied Repre-sentatives.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 94thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Foreign Secretary gave the War Cabinet an account ofthe Meeting of the Allied Representatives, which had taken placethat morning and afternoon and had passed off satisfactorily. TheDutch Government had taken some exception to the reference inArticle IV of the Atlantic Charter to &quot; due respect for theirexisting obligations.&quot; After consultation with the DominionGovernments it had been decided to say nothing on this point. Atthe last minute the Russian Government had declined to agree to our proposal to set up a Bureau under Sir Frederick Leith-Ross.Perhaps the most significant political point had been that the czech representative had made a declaration jointly on behalf ofthe Czechs and the Poles.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Middle 1.   The Prime Minister, on behalf of the War Cabinet,East. extended a warm welcome to the Minister of State, who was on aEeportbythe flying visit.  He thought it would be helpful to hear from him anMinister of account of how things were going in the Middle East, and of theState. directions in which Ministers could help him in his important task.The Minister of State then gave a general account of theposition in the Middle East, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.
Aid to Russia.Debate inParliament, andProductionCampaign.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 95thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Prime Minister said that he proposed, when Parliamentmet on Tuesday, to make a short statement in public, and later tomove the House into Secret Session, when he would give some information as to the extent of the aid which we are giving to Russia.General agreement was expressed with this procedure and withthe view that it was impossible to discuss this matter adequately in public.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he proposed, in a speech towards the end of the week, to strike the note of the need for a sustained effort in the factories, in order to meetthe requirements of Russia as well as of ourselves.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Lord Halifax. 5.   The Prime Minister said that Lord Halifax was leavingthat night to return to the United States of America. It had been agreat pleasure to them to have him among them once more. they wished to thank him for his exertions on their behalf, and to assurehim that he had their fullest confidence. They hoped that he wouldnot hesitate to return to this country again after a few months, to resume his duties as a member of the War Cabinet.Great George Street, S.W.1,September 24, 1941.
