The Russians did not seem tohave lost confidence, and their latest type of fighter had been doingwell. Sixteen German armoured divisions had so far been used against the Russians. The main German thrust was still astride the Minsk-Smolensk Railway towards Moscow.The War Cabinet took note Of these statements.The foreign and MilitarySituations.(previous reference erence:W.M.

The Foreign Secretary gave the following information : Turkey.There was reason to believe that the Turkish government still intended to base their foreign policy on the Anglo-TurkishAgreement.Japan.There was no reliable indication of Japan&apos;s future policy.U.S.S.R. 3   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the denial of oil to Minister of Economic Warfare (W.P.

Home Defence.PreparednessagainstInvasion.Production.Arrangementsfor forthcoming debate.the Russians the best method of denying Russia&apos;s oil resources tothe enemy and to report what offer, in his judgment, should be madeto the Soviet Government.The War Cabinet-While agreeing with the importance of this matter,decided that it would be preferable first to inviteSir Stafford Cripps&apos;s views as to how this matter shouldbe handled; and invited the Foreign Secretary, in consul-tation with the Minister of Economic Warfare, to telegraph to Sir Stafford Cripps accordingly. /4. The Lord Privy Seal informed the War Cabinet that thePrime Minister had decided that instructions should be issuedthat All our defences were to be brought to the very higheststate of anti-invasion efficiency by the 1st September. In themeantime, of course, no vigilance should be relaxed.Instructions had been issued in this sense by the Chiefs of staff to their Commanders-in-Chief, and the Prime Minister asked thatthis direction should also be brought to the notice of all civil departments.The Lord Privy Seal added that he understood that the PrimeMinister proposed to issue a suitable warning to the public before long.The War Cabinet-Invited all Ministers to bring this instruction to the noticeof those concerned in their Departments.In a short discussion it was explained that this directive wasnot intended to prevent the despatch of any necessary reinforce-ments to the Middle East.5. The Lord Privy Seal said that it was undesirable that this debate (which would take place on the 2nd and 3rd sitting days in the following week) should extend over a very wide range of subjects. It was proposed that it should cover matters arising onthe Votes of the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of aircraft production, and that the two Ministers should arrange on which of the two days the Minister of Aircraft Production and theParliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Supply should speak.Questions affecting man-power might well be raised, and a ministerial representative of the Ministry of Labour should.also beavailable.The War Cabinet-Expressed general agreement with these suggestions.Great George Street, S. W. 1,July 4, 1941.
COPY. 4(Cypher).SPECIAL ARFAB AND WAR CABINET DISTRIBUTION.To:    SOVIET UNION.Prom   MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC WARFARE    To   MOSCOW.No. 143 ARFAR MOSSY.8th July, 1941. D.    2.20 p.m.    9th July, 1941.SECRET.So soon as you can give us some indication of attitudeof Soviet Government to destruction of Caucasus oil-fields incase of necessity in order to deny oil to the enemy, we areprepared, if you recommend it, to examine what offer might be made to Soviet Government as regards our hearing partof the losses entailed.2.     You will recollect that when this subject was discussed with you in London it was agreed that it would be best to tackle the matter not by offering a money payment butby devising means of helping Soviet Government to replaceconsequent deficiencies both in home supplies of oil and inmachinery destroyed.3.     We should therefore be glad after question of destruction of oil-fields has been raised with Soviet Governmentto learn (a) what are in your view the prospects of soviet authorities taking effective action for the destruction ofthe oil-fields;    (b) whether you think offer on lines indicatedin paragraph 2 is likely to be (i) necessary (ii) effective;(c) nature and scope of offer which would have to be made inorder to produce necessary effect.4.     You should not at this stage make any proposals onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to Soviet Government, but,if it is clear that prospects of effective steps being takenare in fact dependent on some such inducement, you may, inorder to obtain sufficient indications of Soviet views to enableyou to provide us with information requested above, say to soviet authorities that, while you cannot say how matter wouldbe viewed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, yourare prepared to enquire whether there is any prospect of their being ready toassist in making good part of the losses entailed.9^Copies sent to Lord Hankey, Sir E.
