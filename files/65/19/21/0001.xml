He proposed to ask for further progress Reports later on, while monthly Reports from regional commissioners would be considered by the Civil Defence Committee.The main difficulty now being experienced was in regard to shortage of materiel and labour for the manufacture of equipment and appliances.In reply to a question, the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security agreed that in certain areas, particularly thosewhich had not experienced heavy air attack, local authorities were rather slow to respond. Additional powers had, however, beentaken, by which he (the Minister) or the Regional Commissionerscould give specific directions to local authorities.The War Cabinet took note of the Memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security.Great George Street, S.

In this case the fact that theDominions were so associated would, of course, bereferred to when the Resolution was introduced.
