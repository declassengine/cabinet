The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 674-676 : Summary of aircraft losses since the 8th July : Home Theatre Enemy 54 destroyed.18 probable.25 damaged.Our Own 27 fighters (9 pilots safe).28 bombers.2 Coastal Command.Overseas Theatres Enemy 13 destroyed.1 probable.11 damaged.Our Own 11 destroyed.5 damaged.The Prime Minister said that the pressure of our air attacks on the Western Front must be kept up, at any rate for the present,in spite of losses that might be sustained. It might, however, be undesirable to attack continually targets that had especially strong;A.A. defences. Alternative targets, not so strongly defended, couldbe selected.During the previous three days no ships had been sunk.Belated reports had, however, been received of four ships sunk,,totalling 17,000 tons.  One ship of 9,000 tons had been damaged.H.M. Submarine Tigris had sunk an Italian U-boat outward bound from Bordeaux on the 5th July.The French Forces were withdrawing to Aleppo and Horns.Our troops, who were still keeping up the pressure, in spite of thepossibility of an armistice, had occupied Damour and were workingtowards Beirut.Heavy fighting continued in three or four areas, specially atOstrov in the north. Although the situation was somewhat obscure,it appeared that the Russians had made a successful counter-attackat Vitebsk. No very definite German gains appeared to have beenmade during the last twenty-four hours.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Iran.2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatM. Maisky had told him that morning that his Government were anxious to clear up the position in Iran, where they believed therewere 5,000 or 10,000 Germans, and had asked whether we had any suggestions.The Foreign Secretary said that he was examining whateffective steps we could take if we asked the Iranian Government to turn these Germans out and they refused. It was also desirable tofind out, further, what the Russian Government had in mind.The War Cabinet-Recorded no decision, but expressed general agreementwith the desirability of eliminating German influence in...       Iran.[22712]
U.S.S.R. 3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that russian Military M. Maisky had stated that the Russian Mission had been pleasedMission. with the way in which they had been received and with the contactsmade with the Chiefs of Staff.The Minister of Information said that the question had been raised whether the Internationale should be played by the B.B.C.before the 9 o&apos; clock News on Sunday evening. He understood thatthe Russians had decided to use the Kutusoff March of 1812 as their war tune.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to ascertain whether theRussians would like the Kutusoff March of 1812 played bythe B.B.C. on Sunday evening, when the National Anthemsof our Allies were played.Playing of theInternationale.Chemical 4.   The Minister of Information said that a telegram, whichWarfare. would not be published, had been received from Reuter&apos;s Corres-correspondent in Moscow to the effect that the Germans intended usingpoison gas against the Russians. This message (which might havebeen inspired by the Russian Government) had suggested that, if wewould now announce that, if the Germans used gas against Russia,we should at once retaliate, this would prove an effective deterrent.The War Cabinet-(a) Agreed that it would be premature to give any undertakingon the lines suggested.(6) Invited the Secretary of State for War to report to thePrime Minister on the position of our gas stocks.(c) Invited the Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff toascertain to what extent the Russians were supplied withgas masks.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (G) (41) 64)proposing the establishment of a scheme of control over the recruit-ment of labour admitted into the United Kingdom from Eire. Itwas thought that the numbers involved might be of the order of30,000, besides some 10,000 to 15,000 men who would be broughtover for agricultural work this summer.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthe scheme of control had been drawn as tightly as possible, and hadbeen agreed with the Security Services and the other Departmentsconcerned. But 100 per cent, security could not be claimed for it.The Dominions Office had pointed out that the effect of the schemewas to apply to Irish labour conditions normally applicable to alienlabour. The restrictions proposed had, however, been informallymentioned to representatives of the Eire Departments concerned,without provoking any suggestion that they would embarrass the eire authorities, who had shown considerable readiness toco-operate.The Home Secretary undertook to consider the practicability of applying the restrictions retrospectively to labourers from Eire whohad recently arrived in this country.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals in W.P. (G) (41) 64 on the under-standing that considerable importance was attached to thethorough and efficient application of the scheme of controlsummarised in paragraph 4. The Home Secretary was authorised to include further restrictions in the scheme if&quot; improved security could thereby be secured.Eire.Arrangementsfor Control ofLabour admitted into the UnitedKingdom.
135W.M. 68 (41).Man-Power. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Paper by the MinisterBequirements of of Labour and National Service (W.P. (G) (41) 63) on the provisionthe Army.        of man-power for the Army.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 49thConclusions,Minute 6.)Requirements ofAerodromeDefence.Provision of men for general service.-Under the scheme set out in the Memorandum, 150,000 men would be called up in the last six months of the year.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he understood that at a discussion on aerodrome defence at the DefenceCommittee on Monday, the 7th July,* it had been pointed out that additional- man-power was required for the defence of aerodromes,and a suggestion had been made that this should be met by calling up the 18-year-old group. The present age of call-up was 19 years.To reduce this age by twelve months would involve serious difficulties. There was, for example, the question of apprenticeship.Again, the two other Services were anxious to obtain their fair shareof the 18-year-olds, and the Army wished to do more to bring home to young recruits the attractions of the Tank Corps.The Prime Minister explained that the Air Ministry, who were responsible for the defence of certain aerodromes of lesserimportance which had no troops stationed near them, had madeappeals for volunteers, hoping to get men who were too young ortoo old for ordinary military service. He (the Prime Minister) had felt that it was undesirable to make public appeals for volunteers for aerodrome defence. This had led to the suggestion that the18-year-old group might be called up, not for service on aerodromes,but in order to increase the number of men available for service inthe Army generally. This, however, had only been put forward forconsideration as one of the ways in which the shortage of men forthe Army might be met. He proposed that the issues involved should be discussed at a special Meeting of Ministers to be preside over by the Lord President.  This was agreed.Recruitment of women for the Auxiliary Services.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he hadtaken steps, in conjunction with the Secretary of State for War, to launch a campaign to recruit women for the A.T.S. About the sametime, however, the Air Ministry had launched a campaign for theW.A.A.F., notwithstanding that they had a waiting-list. He asked that there should be inter-Departmental discussion, at which his department would be represented, before such campaigns were launched.The Minister of Information referred to the part which hisMinistry could play in ensuring due co-ordination of the publicityarrangements for these campaigns, as the result of the meetings of departmental Publicity Officers over which he now presided.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (G)(41) 63).(2) Invited the following Ministers The Lord President of the Council (Chairman),The Minister of Supply,The Minister of Labour and National Service,The Minister of Home Security, andThe three Service Ministers,to consider in the light of the above discussion the best means of meeting the additional requirements of man-power for aerodrome defence which had recently been* D.O. (41), 47th Meeting, Minute 1.
made. Their report should be available for considera-tion by the War Cabinet on the 17th July.(3) Invited the Ministers referred to in (2), together with theMinister of Information, to consider what arrangements should be made to prevent overlapping and competition between the recruitment of women for the women&apos;services, and to secure a fair allocation of the availablewomen. A report on this matter should also be availablefor consideration on the 17th July.Great George Street, S. W. 1,July 10, 1941.
