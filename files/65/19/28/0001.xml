Man-Power. 1.   The Minister of Labour and National Service said thatLiability to some six months ago he had agreed that whole-time lay evangelistsMilitary Service should be treated as though they were ministers of religion. At theof certain time he had been strongly pressed to accord similar treatment to members of the certain members of the &apos;&apos; Oxford &apos;&apos; Group employed whole-time on&quot; Oxford &quot; its work, who claimed that they were indistinguishable from the layGroup. evangelists of religious organisations. He had not felt able to admitthis claim, and had called up the men in question, who had beenunder 30.He would shortly be calling up 11 men, aged between 30 and 36,who were employed whole-time on the work of the Group. He had again been strongly pressed to exempt these men. He had taken theline that he could not recognise a claim to exemption, on religiousgrounds, of members of this group. In view of the political pressure which was being brought to bear upon him, he would beglad to be assured that the War Cabinet supported the line whichhe had taken.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the action taken by the Minister of Labour and national Service, and promised their full support.Aircraft 2.   The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that theProduction. Sub-Committee on Air Services of the Select Committee on NationalComments of Expenditure had prepared a Report on the Albemarle Aircraft,the Select The main Committee, by a narrow majority, had agreed that theCommittee on Report should not be published, on the ground that this would beNational prejudicial to the public interest.  The Report had been sent to himExpenditure on  (the Prime Minister) as a confidential document,the Albemarle. The Select Committee had reached the view that the moneyexpended on the production of this aircraft had largely been wasted,and that its production should be stopped as soon as possible.The development of this type of aircraft, which was manufac-tured from steel and wood, had been started over three years ago asan insurance against shortage of aluminium. He thought theGovernment had a very strong case for the action which had beentaken.If the War Cabinet agreed, he proposed to inform Sir JohnWardlaw-Milne, M.P., that the Minister of Supply (who was veryfamiliar with this matter), accompanied by the Minister of aircraft production, would be prepared to give evidence before the membersof the Co-ordinating Committee and of the Sub-Committee on air services.The War Cabinet-Approved this course, subject to its being made clear thatit was the exceptional circumstances of the case whichjustified Ministers giving evidence before the Committeeon this occasion.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M.

In the circum-stances, he agreed to a suggestion made by the Chief of the ImperialOverseas Theatre Enemy 6 destroyed.Our Own 8 fighters.Six attacks had been made by aircraft on submarines, four ofwhich had been promising. On the previous night 76 aircraft had attacked Turin, and, although the weather had been bad, 60 percent, of them had bombed the target. Four large and severalsmaller fires had been started. Anti-aircraft fire had been ineffective-tive and there had been no night fighters.  We had lost 4 machines.During the previous three days our aircraft had hit two enemy merchant vessels and a flak ship in Home Waters, and fourmerchant ships in the Middle East.Our Hurricane Squadrons had been unable to go into action inthe attack against Murmansk made by the Germans on the previous day because the guns and ammunition which had been despatchedby a different route had not been delivered by the Russians.Naval It was now confirmed that H.M. Submarine Perseus had sunkOperations.       the Italian tanker Maya (3,867 tons) off the Dardanelles on the5th September.Shipping Losses.        A U-boat attack had been made on the previous day on a home-bound Atlantic Convoy off Greenland. Nine or ten ships, averaging3,000 tons, had so far been reported sunk.  Reinforcements for the escort of this Convoy had been despatched.Military A new and heavy German attack on the Murmansk front had operations. begun and some progress had been made. The situation gave causeU.S.S.R. for anxiety. The powerful German attack in the area of Gomel had also begun. If successful, its results would be serious, for Kievwould be threatened from both north and south. In the Leningraddistrict there was no change in the situation. There were furtherindications that a combined operation against the Crimea and/orthe north-western Black Sea coast was being prepared. SomeRussian divisions had been brought back from the Far East.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
General Staff that we could relax the preparations for our troops to be ready for an immediate further advance into Persia.Internment of The Foreign Secretary added that he had received a message,Germans. through the Swiss Government, that the Germans proposed, as areprisal, to seize and intern British subjects from the channel islands equivalent in number to the German subjects interned byus in Persia. Further, they would not grant a safe conduct to thiscountry to British subjects who had volunteered to fight in Finland.They would have to spend the rest of the war in Sweden.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.7. The Prime Minister said that, in view of the inadequacy of other routes, it was important to take all practicable steps toimprove routes through Persia. We must not be content withdeveloping the railway, but should also explore the possibilities of improving the roads and getting vehicles from the United States.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he hoped to let the Prime Minister have a report in the course of the day, inreply to a Minute which had been addressed to him on this subject.The Secretary of State for the Colonies suggested that pioneerbattalions could be raised in the British Colonial Empire and put to work on the Persian communications.The War Cabinet-Invited the Colonial Secretary to submit to the DefenceCommittee, after consultation with the Secretary of Statefor War, proposals for utilising the man-power of theColonial Empire on the lines suggested.U.S.S.R.Supply routesthrough Persia.(previous reference erence:W.M.

Food Rationing.       10.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theProposals for Lord President of the Council (W.P. (41) 216) containing theextension. recommendations of the Lord Presidents Committee, andi of the(Previous Minister of Food, for an extension of rationing.Reference: The Committee had considered two alternative systems: aW.M. (41) 26th &quot;group system&quot; and a &quot;points system,&quot; and had decided in conclusions, favour of the latter.Minute 3.) The recommendations in W.P. (41) 216 were as follows : (i) Rationing control, by means of a Points System, should beapplied as soon as the necessary administrative arrange-ments can be made to the group of commoditiesdescribed as &quot; canned meals.&quot;(ii) The Minister of Food should be authorised to extend thePoints System of rationing to the other foodstuffsenumerated in the Memorandum as soon as he feelsjustified in undertaking this extension in the light of experience gained in the operation of a Points Systemof food rationing.(iii) The Minister of Food should be authorised to undertakeat once the administrative arrangements (including the printing of coupons, &amp;c.) necessary to enable him toextend this system of rationing over the whole range of foodstuffs set out in the Memorandum.(iv) A system of group rationing of foodstuffs should not beintroduced unless experience shows that control over&apos;&apos; canned meals&apos;&apos; by means of a Points System has failed to achieve its object.The War Cabinet-Approved the recommendations in W.P.

(G)(41) 88).The Prime Minister said that certain sections of the Houseof Commons were reluctant to consider at this time, an amendmentof theTrade Disputes Act. In the circumstances, he would be glad if it was possible to postpone action on the lines proposed in this paper for, say, a month. He was anxious to avoid raising thismatter, in the immediate future, as an issue of principle. he accordingly invited the three Supply Ministers to consider, inconsultation with the Minister of Labour and National Service, theadoption of administrative measures designed to prevent difficulties arising out of the refusal of firms to act on recommendations madeby Courts of Inquiry into cases where those firms refused to acceptthe recognised practice of negotiating and discussing labour questions with Trades Unions representing their workpeople.The War Cabinet-Approved the course proposed by the Prime Ministerat &quot;X.&quot;
Civil Defence:Fire Prevention.CompulsoryEnrolmentOrder.12. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityraised the question whether an Order should be passed exemptingMinisters in charge of Departments, and Parliamentary Secretaries,from the requirement of the Compulsory Enrolment Order, wherebyin areas in which the Business Premises Order had been applied allmale British subjects between the ages of 18 and 60 had to registerfor compulsory Civil Defence duties.The War Cabinet-Decided that no Order should be made conferring exemp-tion on Ministers, and that the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security should take appropriateadministrative action to relieve Ministers of any obliga-tions under this Order which would interfere with the performance of their duties.Western Front. 13.   The Prime Minister said that this matter would be putPublication of on the Agenda for Monday&apos;s Meeting of the War Cabinet.  In theLord Gorfs meantime, he invited Lord Halifax, the Secretary of State for Air,Despatches. the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of(Previous Information to read the despatches, if they had not already doneReference- 80, in order to give the War Cabinet the benefit of their views atW.M.

TJMTTED STATESOf AMERICA.Help in ConvoyLatt ers .- MOST SECRET. -W.M. (41) 93, Minute 4,THE PRIME MINISTER said that we had now received information as to the areas in the Atlantic in respect ofwhich the United States Navy would assume responsibilityfor convoys other than troop convoys.   The line which hadbeen drawn by the President was far more favourable than had been expected.    It ran East of Iceland down the 10thMeridian to the Faroes, and then   across to the 25thMeridian to a point just West of the Azores.   The areatherefore covered nearly three-quarters of the north atlantic.   Any Axis ships West of this line would be attacked by U.S. Naval Forces.   Further, the Presidentproposed to convoy ships flying the American or Icelandicflag, and this protection would extend to any of our ships which cared to join these convoys.   For the present, theUnited States proposed to leave the slow convoys (in whichthere were no ships flying the U.S. or Icelandic flag) tothe care of the Canadian Navy, and to confine their protection to the fast Halifax convoys .The Prime Minister pointed, out that the recentattack on one of our convoys in Greenland waters had takenplace well within the area for which the United states would be responsible.   He thought that the dispositionsmade by the President must almost certainly lead toconflict with German U-boats, and that such conflict wouldresult in a rise in tempers.The Prime Minister said that he believed thatthe President would include in his broadcast that nightsome details of the above arrangement.   It was, however,of the greatest importance that there should be nospeculation in the Press indicating any fore-knowledge orexpectation of a statement on these lines.sat George Street, S.W.1,Hth September, 1941.
