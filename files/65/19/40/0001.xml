The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 775-778 : Summary of aircraft losses since the 16th October :  .Home Theatre Enemy 4 destroyed.damaged.4Our Own 1 Fighter.2 Bombers.3 Coastal Command Aircraft.Overseas the enemy had lost three machines with one damaged,as against two damaged of our own.Two armed trawlers had been hit by cannon gunfire in home waters and a 5,000-ton merchant ship probably hit by bombs. Inthe Mediterranean three ships of about 5,000 tons had been hit, oneof which had sunk. A U-boat had been attacked by a Catalinaaircraft 600 miles out in the Atlantic.During the previous four days 71,000 tons of shipping had been sunk and 25,000 tons damaged. Particulars were given of the heavy attack on a North Atlantic convoy on the 15th, 16th and17th October. There had also been U-boat attacks on shipping offAlexandria and Freetown, and two ships had been sunk by mine inthe Thames Estuary.The operation of reinforcing Malta with aircraft had been successfully completed.The Chiefs of Staff were invited to re-examine the position atSpitzbergen in view of the fact that the enemy had attempted toestablish a wireless station there.In the Northern Sector there had been no change. There were indications that fresh German attacks might be impending on theline Lake Umen and Lake Seliger, where German forces in theRzhev-Kalinin area already threatened the Russians. TheRussians were, however, counter-attacking strongly againstKalinin.In the central sector the Germans claimed to have annihilatedMarshal Timoshenko&apos;s Army, but Russian resistance continuedsouth and south-west of Moscow. There was no doubt that the advance on Moscow had slowed down, partly owing to the bad weather and supply difficulties, and partly to the stubborn russian resistance. Moscow had been declared in a state of siege and aspecial Commander appointed. A fresh attack was being made onKharkov, and the Germans claimed to have captured Taganrog.Odessa had been evacuated and the town thoroughly &quot; scorched.&quot;The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Air Policy.Enemy-occupied territory.(previous references:W.M. (41) 103rdConclusions,      &apos;Minute 4, andW.M. (40) 213thConclusions,Minute 8.)[23034]2. The Chief of the Air Staff said that the American Eaglesquadron had that day attacked and blown up a moving ammunitiontrain in Occupied France. This attack had been contrary to a WarCabinet ruling (laid down over a year ago) that no moving trains in occupied France should be attacked. This rule had been based onthe fact that in attacks by bombing aircraft from a high level it wasvery difficult to distinguish the type of train attacked.The War Cabinet- *(a) Agreed that in future fighter aircraft should be allowed toattack moving goods trains in Occupied France.b 2
(b) Invited the Chief of the Air Staff to submit a proposal inregard to the bombing of certain factories in OccupiedFrance known to be engaged in the manufacture of munition supplies for the enemy.Bombing Policy.        (c) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to consider whether the position(Previous in the Battle of the Atlantic called for a resumption ofReference: bombing attacks on ports used as submarine bases or for w.M. (41) 89th the manufacture of submarines.Conclusions,Minute 1.)The Dominions.Representationof DominionGovernments inLondon.(previous usReference:&apos;W.M. (41) 88th &apos;Conclusions,Minute 5.)3. The War Cabinet were informed that Sir Earle Page would arrive in this country in about a week&apos;s time.The Prime Minister said that, while Sir Earle Page should beinvited to attend a special Meeting of the War Cabinet, it wouldnot be appropriate to invite him to attend Meetings of the WarCabinet regularly while in this country.The question was raised whether some special steps should betaken to assist a truer appreciation by Australian public opinionof the war situation (e.g., a special return visit by a Minister).The War Cabinet decided to defer consideration of thisquestion until after Sir Earle Page&apos;s visit.Afghanistan. 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the(Previous Afghan Government had apparently made up their minds to sendReference: away all the non-official Germans and Italians now in their country.W.M. (41) 94th The plan was that these German and Italian subjects should be sentConclusions, to India in the first place, with a view to their eventual return to minute 4.) their own countries.   There might be some difficulty as to who should pay for the cost of their journey.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Treasury would,if necessary, find the money.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of the above.The Far East.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 103rdConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The War Cabinet were given further information as to thesituation in the Far East, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Finland,Hungary and roumania.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 93rdConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theSoviet Ambassador had brought him a message from M. Molotovasking that we should declare war on Finland, Hungary and roumania. The situation had changed since the War Cabinet had last considered this matter, and it might be that the right coursenow was to declare war on these three countries as a token of oursolidarity with Russia, although from the British point of viewthese declarations of war would serve no useful purpose.As regards Finland, the history of the negotiations made itnecessary that we.should consult with the United States government before taking any action.
The War Cabinet-(i) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to circulate a further Memorandum on this matter,(ii) Invited the Home Secretary to circulate a Memorandum onthe question whether the suggested declarations of war would inflict hardship on any considerable number ofnationals of the three countries now in the UnitedKingdom and friendly to this country.Egypt.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 59thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs as to the Egyptian Govern-menfs gold reserve (W.&apos;P. (41) 243).In discussion, the view was expressed that, although the goldwas in no danger, news of its removal at this moment might give riseto alarmist and defeatist rumours.The War Cabinet-Withheld authority for the proposal in this Memorandum,subject to further consideration in, say, a month or six weeks.The CommunistParty.(Previous(previous reference.:W.M. (41) 72ndConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum on theCommunist Party in Great Britain, prepared by the SecurityExecutive and circulated bv direction of the Prime Minister(W.P. (41) 244).Some discussion ensued as to the circumstances in which repre-sentations could properly be received from shop stewards. It wassuggested that, on rare occasions, it might be useful that a SupplyMinister should receive a deputation from the shop stewards in aparticular factory on matters not within the scope of the negotia-tions normally dealt with by Trades Union leaders.The War Cabinet was informed that the recognised procedure was that shop stewards should make representations to the manage-ment in any particular factory. If discussion between themanagement and shop stewards did not lead to a settlement of thematters dealt with, then the proper procedure was for the matter tobe reported to the Trade Union officials. Any question of Ministersreceiving deputations was a matter to be arranged with the Unionconcerned. If Ministers were to adopt the policy of dealing direct with shop stewards, the Trades Unions&apos; authority would inevitably be weakened.The Prime Minister said that, while this was not the occasion to lay down a rigid rule, great importance should be attached to theMinisters in charge of Supply and Contracting Departmentsfollowing the recognised procedure in regard to these matters.A suggestion was also made, and met with general approval,that the Minister of Information should take suitable steps toensure that undue publicity was not given to the series of meetings and conferences being held under the auspices of the Shop Stewards&apos;National Council and similar bodies.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Great George Street, S. W. 1,October 20, 1941.
