Naval, Militaryand air operations.^previous reference:W.M. (41) 69thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.U.S.S.R.1.   The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 681-683 : Summary of aircraft losses since the 14th July v Home Theatre Enemy 12 destroyed (1 A.A.).2 probable....5 damaged.Our Own 4 Fighters.6 Day Bombers.13 Night Bombers.1 Coastal Command.Overseas Theatre Enemy 10 destroyed.3 probable.Our Own 5 destroyed.During the last three days 25 enemy merchant ships, totalling120,000 tons, had been hit, and one probably hit. These figuresincluded a very successful raid on Rotterdam on the previous day,when 19 ships had been hit in a low-flying attack.Air photographs of the recent attacks on Aachen and Munstershowed that about 150 acres in each town had been totally destroyed.This damage was comparable with that suffered by Coventry.During the previous three days 41,000 tons of shipping hadbeen lost, including one ship of 5,000 tons sunk by a U-boat andtwo ships totalling 28,000 by aircraft. The latter figure, however,included the 27,000-ton Georgic, which had been destroyed in theMiddle East. 15,000 tons of shipping had been damaged. TheBaron Napier (4,000 tons), reported sunk last week, had now arrived in port.The German drive towards Leningrad had made some progress,but not at a very fast rate. Some German elements had been cutoff by the Russians. In the Smolensk area the Germans had madetwo drives. One to the South-West of the town had been stopped;but the other on the North-West had made progress. The german wireless that day claimed that their troops had entered Smolensk.German troops were North-West and South-West of Kiev, but hadnot yet entered the town. General Mason MacFarlane consideredthat the Germans would probably continue to drive the Russiansback, but only at the cost of much harder fighting than they had anticipated.There were indications that the German Air Force wasexperiencing difficulty in finding sufficient fighter protection fortheir bombers.  .The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Foreign Affairs.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 68thConclusions,Minute 3.)U.S.S.R.2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave thefollowing information : *M. Maisky continued to appeal to us to undertake operations.He (the Foreign Secretary) understood that possible action wouldbe considered at the Defence Committee (Operations) that evening.[22734]b 2
Russo-PolishRelations. -(previous reference:W.M. (41) 69thConclusions,Minute 3.)Afghanistan. .Iran (Persia).(previous reference:W.M. (41) 68thConclusions,Minute 2.)Czechoslovakia.Proposals for recognition.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 69thConclusions,Minute 3.)The negotiations between the Russians and the Poles had not made encouraging progress. At the moment the main obstacles were that the Poles wanted the Russians to reoognise their pre-warfrontiers, both in the east and the west. The question of Polishprisoners in Russia now offered rather less difficulty, the Russianshaving released a certain number.The Afghan Government had behaved badly in agreeing to theappointment of von Hentig as German Minister at Kabul. HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India were informing the Afghan Government jointly that we were compelled to takeaway certain facilities which we had given them. The intention was to increase the pressure until the Afghans got rid of theGerman Minister.Iran was harbouring a large number of Germans, estimated by us at 5,000. Here, too, we should have to apply pressure; andwe had told the Soviet Government that we were ready to act jointly with them in this matter.Russia had now concluded an agreement giving full recognition to the Czechoslovakian Government in this country. M. Benes was anxious that, when this agreement was published (probably on thefollowing day), we should at the same time give full recognition totheir Provisional Government. This would avoid undue emphasisbeing placed on the full recognition Of the Provisional government by Russia. The Dominions had been asked not to dissent from thisrecognition which we proposed to give, but no answers had yet beenreceived.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that it was very desirable that full recognition bythis country of the Provisional Czechoslovakian Govern-ment should be announced on the following day.(2) Asked that a further telegram should be sent at once to theDominion Governments informing them that, unless theynotified any objections to us by the following day, we proposed then to announce that we had given full recognition to the Provisional CzechoslovakianGovernment.Japan.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 66thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The War Cabinet were given the latest information inregard to probable Japanese intentions in Indo-China.A short discussion ensued as to the counter-measures which weshould take, and it was agreed that the matter should be further discussed at a Meeting of the Defence Committee to be held that night.United State ofAmerica.Mr. Harry-Hopkins.4. At the invitation of the Prime Minister Mr. HarryHopkins, President Roosevelt&apos;s personal representative, who had arrived by air that afternoon from the United States, made a short statement.The munitions programme of the United States had greatly improved in recent months. He gave as examples of this improve-ment the position in respect of merchant shipbuilding and aircraft and tank production.The p6litical situation had also greatly improved. Thus, thepeople of the United States had warmly supported the President&apos;decision to send troops to Iceland (C).
While it would not be true to say that the American people as a whole were anxious to enter the war, if the President decidedthat the time had come to make war on Germany, the vast majorityof the population, of all parties, Would endorse his action and accordhim their full support.[Mr. Hopkins withdrew after making his statement.]Later, the Prime Minister said that Mr. Hopkins had consented to a statement being published that one of his first actions onarriving in London had been to attend a meeting of the WarCabinet, which had been in session.Middle East.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 48thConclusions,Minute 2.)Man Power.Eequirementsfor AerodromeDefence.Recruitment forWomen&apos;services.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 68thConclusions,Minute 6.)China.international air Force.(previous reference:W:m: (40) 308thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. A short discussion ensued as to the military situation inthe Middle East.The War Cabinet-Accepted   the   recommendations   set   out   in   para-graphs 5 (i)-(v) and 6 (i)-(iv) of the Report by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (G) (41) 68).7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Burma (W.P. (41) 165).The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal in the Memorandum, namely, thatthe Governor of Burma should be given discretion, afterconsultation with Colonel Chennault and in agreementwith the Commander-in-Chief, Far East (a) To allow the aircraft to have their guns and ammu-nition fitted before starting on their flight from burma into China, if no other alternative, such asfitting the armament at a Chinese aerodrome such asLoiwing, appeared practicable;(6) To permit such instruction in the use and maintenanceof the aircraft while they were in Burma as mightbe decided to be necessary, and as might be practicable having regard to R.A.F. needs.India and.Burma., Proposal to post-pone elections to IndianProvincialLegislatures and burma House ofRepresentatives.8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India and Burma (W,P. (G) (41) 67).The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals in this Memorandum, which were as follows: (a) That the Government of India Act should be amended to postpone the date on which the presentProvincial Legislative Assemblies would be auto-matically dissolved until 12 months after the war,
India and theWar.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 58thConclusions,Minute 6.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (W.P. (G) (41) 69). To this wereappended certain telegrams from the Governor-General, namely,1649-S, 1655-S, 1656 and 1662-S.The point at issue was the threat by the Punjab Government to-resign if no Punjabi was added to the Executive Council.The Secretary of State for India explained that while, ofcourse, the Government of the Punjab had no claim on constitu-tional grounds to have a representative on the Executive Council,in view of their full support of the war effort and of the fact thathalf the Indian Army was drawn from the Punjab, their claim was most understandable.The proposal to add two seats to the Executive Council wasjustifiable on administrative grounds.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that the Punjabclaim was a strong one and should be met, and that it was important to meet Sikendar&apos;s point of view. Indeed, it wassuggested that the Punjabi attitude in this matter might well havebeen foreseen.The War Cabinet accordingly agreed to the following proposals : (1) That the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council should be expanded by the addition of 5 instead of 3 non-officialIndian members, in order to make it possible to include aPunjabi on the Council.(2) That the two extra Portfolios should be found byseparating Labour from Commerce, and by creating aseparate Portfolio for &quot; Indians Overseas,&quot; and shouldbe filled in the manner proposed by the Governor-General.Great ^George Street, S. W. 1,July 17, 1941.but to leave intact the Governors discretionarypower to dissolve before that date.(6) That an amendment to the Government of Burma Actshould be made on the same lines, hut that theGovernor of Burma should simultaneously announce that this did not necessarily imply that the Houseof Representatives would not be dissolved this year.
