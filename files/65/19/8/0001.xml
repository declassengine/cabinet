The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 684-687.Summary of aircraft losses since the 17th July : Home Theatre &apos;Enemy- &apos;19 destroyed.9 probable.5 damaged.Our dtvn^-iO Fighters.12 Bombers.3 Coastal Command.Overseas Theatre Enemy-3 destroyed.Our own 4 destroyed.Since the 17th July 15 enemy merchant ships totalling72,500 tons had been hit, of which eight had been claimed as total losses.During the previous 4 days 1 ship of 4,000 tons had been sunk by a U-boat, and belated reports had been received of 2 moretotalling 10,000 tons. 18,000 tons of shipping had been damaged.One ship, damaged in convoy, had shot down the Fokke-Wolfe whichhad attacked it.The German drives towards Leningrad, Moscow and to theSouth-East of Kieff continued. The situation at Murmansk was reported to be in hand. In the Baltic States there had been heavy fighting to hold the German thrust towards Leningrad. West of lake Ilman the Russian Command stated that 2 German armoured divisions had been surrounded and had had very heavy losses. InWhite Russia the situation in the Smolensk salient was confused.The Russians had counter-attacked on the Northern and Southernsides of the salient, but it seemed unlikely that the Russians still held Smolensk. In the Ukraine the German advance was mainly to the South and South-East of Kieff, which the Russians still held.Axis forces had reached the Dneister and had probably got one ormore bridgeheads across. Political Commissars had beenreappointed to the Russian Army.Large-scale mobilisation was in progress in Japan. the preparations included the taking up of shipping, calling up of reservists and the requisitioning of lorries, horses, &amp;c. A move tothe south against Indo-China seemed indicated.The activities of the Tobruk garrison had been worrying theGermans. An Italian motorised mobile column had been brought upto the forward area. This suggested that raiding action was contemplated.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.U.S.S.H.military assistance.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 66thConclusions,Minute 5.)2.   The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a telegram which he had received from M. Stalin, and the reply which he had sent after consultation with the Chiefs of Staff (Paper NoC.O.S. (41) 146 (0)). v   p        -The Foreign Secretary said that M. Maisky thought that theRussian Government would be disappointed with the PrimeMinister^ reply and would suggest that we should do more to help them by the supply of war material.[22746]b 2
Supplies of WarMaterial,including aircraft.Russo-PolishNegotiations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 71stConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that these negotiations were still proving difficult, the main trouble being the Poles&apos; wish toget from Russia an undertaking to restore their former frontiers.General Sikorski was having difficulty with some members of his cabinet for having gone some way to. meet the Russian pointof view.A revised draft of the Agreement had now been sent to Moscow.No-one could say whether it would be approved.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Spain. 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theAnslo-American Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (41) 174), together&quot; ..-i.-in....iPolicy.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 31stConclusions,Minute 3.)with the following telegrams :-Foreign Office to-Madrid No. 1063.  Madrid to Foreign Office Nos. 1095rand HOOrThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that general franco&apos;s recent speech seemed to show that he had ranged himself with Senor Suner, and that there was no question of his taking the lead in the defence of Spain against German invasion or penetration-tion. Looked at broadly, it seemed that we should have to decide whether we were ready to leave matters to develop until it suitedGermany to bring Spain into the war.The immediate issue was whether we should continue ourpresent policy of affording economic assistance to Spain and encouraging the United States to do likewise.The War Cabinet were informed that M. Maisky had presentedlarge demands for aircraft to the Secretary of State for Air, whohad told him that they could not be met.The Secretary of State for Air thought, however, that it mightbe possible to make a limited number of aircraft (some of Americanmanufacture) available to Russia without damage to our essential needs.The War Cabinet were also informed that the United StatesGovernment were about to make a certain number of aircraft, andalso other supplies, available to Russia by the Vladivostok route.It was recognised that it would be many months before aircraft dispatched by this route would come into action. Nevertheless, the encouragement to be afforded by this help was important.It was also felt that there would be advantage in jointdiscussion between the United States authorities and ourselves as tothe extent and methods of the material help to be sent to Russia.The War Cabinet-Took note that these matters would be discussed between mr. Hopkins or Mr. Harriman and the Paymaster-General,as Chairman of the Committee for the Co-ordination ofAllied Supplies, and asked that any matters requiringdecision should be reported to them by the Chairman ofthis Committee as a matter of urgency.
After discussion the Foreign Secretary suggested the followingmodification of the proposals in paragraph 12 of his Memorandum,namely : ;. (i) To say, in reply to any Parliamentary enquiries, that theunfriendly attitude adopted by the Head of the SpanishState made it extremely difficult for this country tocontinue further with its policy of affording economichelp to Spain.(ii) Not to press the United States to continue against theirwill to provide special facilities for Spain.The War Cabinet-Referred   this   matter   to   the   Defence   Committee(Operations).United States of 5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theAmerica. Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (G) (41) 70) containing the names of the invitation to members of a Mission, representing both the Management and theRepresentatives Labour sides of British Industry, which had been invited to make of British        tour of the Defence Industries in the United States.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of W.P. (G) (41) 70.(ii) Agreed that the visit of this Mission to the United Statesof America could be announced in reply to parliamentary enquiries. It should also be stated thatthe question of extending a reciprocal invitation to united States Industry was under consideration, inconsultation with the United States Government.Industry.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of a Memorandum by the Home Secretary(W.P. (41) 169) summarising recent information relatingto the policy of the Communist Party in this country,(ii) Reaffirmed their previous decisions not to allow the daily worker to resume publication.7. The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that a newol Governor of Bermuda was shortly to be appointed. Should we continue the practice of having a military officer who was a governor and Commander-in-Chief or appoint a civilian Governor? in bermuda the British Military Garrison now amounted only to one company. The United States Garrison would Comprise some,500 naval and 3,000 military personnel. It was believed that theBermuda legislature would agree to the appointment of a civilGovernor, notwithstanding that this would involve them in some extra expense, since part of the Governor &apos;s emolument would inthat event cease to be paid from Army Funds.The War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to proceedwith the appointment of a civil Governor at Bermuda.
Inoi^China.(previous references:W.M. (41) 66thConclusions,Minute 7, andW.M. (41) 71stConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The War Cabinet (who were informed that matters nowseeiheti to bl moving towards a Japanese act of aggression in Indo-China) had before them a Memorandum by tHd Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (W.P. (41) 172) on the economic action to betaken if Japan seized points oVdppui in Indo-China.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Endorsed the recommendations set out in paragraph 8 ofthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum.Anglo-JapaneseCommercialTreaty.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 66thConclusions,Minute 7.)9. In connection with the preceding item, the War cabinet had before them the following telegrams on the proposal that, inthe event of overt action by Japan to secure. bases in SouthernChina, we should give notice of termination of the Anglo-JapaneseTreaty of Commerce of 1911, the India and Japan CommercialConvention of 1934 and the Burma-japan Convention of 1937 : From the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth OfAustralia, No. 3769/and reply thereto, No. 497.rFrom the Government of New Zealand, No. 264.From the Dominions Office to the Governments of Canada,Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, and to the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in South Africa, No. 1617*From the Foreign Office to Tokyo, No. 861/After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the instructions which hadbeen issued in regard to this matter after consultation withthe Prime Ministers of the Dominions.The Far Sast.Co-operationwith the   -netherlands government.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 42ndConclusions,Minute 3.)10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (41) 168) asking for authority, after consultation with the Dominions, to make a communication to the Netherlands Government. This communica-tion would-(a) Give general approval to the recommendations resultingfrom&apos; the Anglo-Dutch-Australian Staff talks inFebruary and the British-Dutch Staff talks in april last, as the basis for the preparation of future plans.(b) State that the United Kingdom were prepared to join theother Governments concerned in a reciprocal agreement to co-operate to the full extent of their available resources if &apos;ahy &apos;6f them &quot;Were foroed to take military action to counter arhied Action by -Che Japanese forces against rts territory or mandated fleWitory.After-a discussion (the Jiain (points of which are summarised in.the Secretary&apos;s Standard .

Production.forthcoming debate.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 69thConclusions,Minute 6.)11. The Prime Minister said that, in view of the extent ofthe ground to be covered in the forthcoming Production Debate, hethought that it should be postponed from Thursday, the 24th, toTuesday, the 29th July. The demand for a second day&apos;s debate should, however, he thought, be resisted. He proposed to open the debate, and that the Minister of Labour and National service should wind up on behalf of the Government.The War Cabinet Approved these suggestions and agreed that arrangements should be made accordingly.Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 21, 1941.

It would on the whole be better that you should not ask for any explanation of unfriendly references to thiscountry, but rather maintain disapproving silence.5.   Meanwhile, I shall be obliged to make some statement in the House of Commons in reply to questions.     I proposeto give a factual account of the steps we have taken and theefforts we have made to secure for Spain supplies andfinancial assistance, which are needed for Spanishreconstruction.     His Majesty&apos;s Government had been preparedto continue their efforts in this direction.     They had however been compelled to review this attitude in the lightof General Franco&apos;s statement, and had concluded that theywere no longer prepared to continue the efforts in which theyhad been engaged to provide special facilities and assistance while the head of the Spanish State adopted sounfriendly an attitude to this country.4.   Please telegraph your views most immediately.5.   For your own information I consider it is essentialthat we should react positively to General Franco&apos;s speech,but what I have in mind at present is mainly negativeaction, i. e. that we should&quot; not make special efforts to give further assistance, whether financial or economic nor should we any longer press the Americans to give assistance ontheir side.OUTWARD TELEGRAM * &apos;[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should bekept under Lock and Key.]

R.   5.05 p.m., 20th July, 1941.19th July, 1941.IMMEDIATE.My telegrams Nos. 1086 and 1094.My talks at Franco&apos;s party last night confirmed the viewthat it is too early to form definite conclusions upon the speech.     Two contradictory opinions are held:   (a) that it isa statement of full Falangist creed given him hy the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs and intended to placate Germany rather than to declare any new policy;   (h) that it is a definite step towards joining the triple pact.      I have asked for an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the purpose of demandingan explanation of the passages which seem to refer to us.     As tofurther policy I would ask you to consider two possibilities:(1) the continuance of our present economic policy upon theassumption that at the &quot;best it may help us to encourage, and tokeep, our friends in Spain and at the worst give us more time.(2) withholding of trade facilities upon the assumption thatFranco has definitely aligned himself with our enemies.     It isclear from the economic discussions which are now proceeding thatthe main problem of the immediate future will be, not so much thesettling of ouotas, as facilitating supplies.     The discussions of the next few weeks are bound to show whether we intend tohelp or hinder in this respect.     It seems to me that our decision must depend upon our military requirements.     Only if we arestrong enough for a military breach with Spain, can we afford aneconomic breach.     If we cannot afford a breach now, when are welikely to be able to afford one?    If I knew that so many monthswere still required I would have a definite ohjective in playingfor further time.     It may well be that, supposing at any time we are militarily strong enough, it would suit the British policy to raise a clear and definite issue with Franco,Whilst I shall be reporting further on both reactions tothe&quot;speech and our economic plans, I shall be extremely gratefulif you can give me some guidance upon the military aspects ofthe problem.This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should be- kept under Lock and Key.]

Thiswill precipitate Franco into a definite German allianceas Minister for Foreign Affairs and his friends willeasily convince him that nothing is to be lost by-breaking with us;   the result will be the final breach&apos;that Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Germans desire.Whether or not we are militarily in a position to face thisbreach at the present moment only His Majesty1s Government,advised by the Chiefs of Staff can decide.   It was to obtainfuidance on this all important point that I sent myelegram No. 1095 which I am not sure you have received.If His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to face themilitary disadvantages of a belligerent Spain I have no suggestion to make as to the statement.   If, however,they are still anxious to play for time I would suggest a factual description of what we have done and an expression of surprise at Franco&apos;s criticism ending witha short paragraph saying that as to the future our action must depend on the action and attitude exhibited by theSpanish Government.   This paragraph should not in my view take the form of a threat against which all Spain,both friendly and otherwise, will instinctively react,but rather of an obvious statement of fact that ifeconomic arrangements are to succeed there must be goodwillon both sides and Franco&apos;s speech seems to show little evidence of goodwill on his side.
v&quot; I should add that subsequent reactions to the speech strengthen the view that critical referenceswere chiefly directed at the United States and not us. andthat the speech itself should not be regarded as adefinite declaration of any new policy.   I suggest thatit would in any case be unwise to&apos;assume that the attack was addressed principally at us.-Most Spaniards are convinced that it was againstAmerica.&apos;If you decide to modify your statement on the grounds&apos;that His Majesty&apos;s Government do not desire an immediatebreach. &apos; I&apos; suggest that you might perhaps reconsideryour views as to my asking for an explanation from theMinister for Foreign Affairs.   I had proposed confrontinghim with the actual statistics.   While on personal grounds-I never wish to see him again, I fear that if I keep away from him I may end in the same futile isolation from which theUnited States Ambassador has been unable to escape for months. ...I hesitate, to refer to internal movements that arenow being organized for getting rid of the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs as we have been often disappointed . .by their failure in the past,   I feel however, &quot;that theymust not be ignored.   According to my best information theyare slowly but surely gathering.force but at present not strong enough, chiefly owing to Russian reaction, to&apos;exploit any breach between Franco and His Majesty&apos;s Government. &apos; Fromthis point of view it would be wiser to leave the internaltrouble to develop without the intervention of a crisesthat might rally much [grp. undecjal feeling in Spain against us *I am not in the least desires   of counselling a weakpolicy in regard to Spain.

Your telegram No.3769 to Commonwealth high Commissioner.

We entirely agree that denunciation of Commercial Treaty might be interpreted in Japan as a reprisal, but we think it wise to avoid giving this as a reason for denunciation. The formula which we would use would be that owing to present conditions, the Treaty did not carry out the objects for which it was concluded.

2. We also recognise that commercially and economically this step will have little effect, but we are advised by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that psychologically the effect in bringing home to Japanese people the perils of bad leadership will be considerable. In this view we conour. Governments of Canada (which is a party to the Treaty), New Zealand and Union of South Africa have agreed to our taking this step. New Zealand Government have further informed us that they propose to take a similar step with reference to New Zealand Trade Agreement with Japan and effect should, moreover, be enhanced by the simultaneous denunciation of the Indo-Japanese Convention of 1984 of which the Government of India have authorised us to give notice.

3. We also agree as to desirability of following up denunciation of the Treaty by the tightening of economic restrictions. See my telegrams II No.155 paragraph 2 and II No.158 as to exchanges with United states Government. This will he easier in the case of restrictions of exports to Japan since such restrictions are already operating throughout the Empire and suitable machinery exists for increasing their severity. But, as you know, we are studying your proposals for restrictions of imports and have put the problem to the United States with a view to ascertaining whether and to what extent they would be prepared to contemplate action in this field. Meanwhile our information is that the most that the United States Government at present have in mind is embargo on exports to Japan of certain selected comodities but we hope to receive fuller indication of their intentions within the next day or two when we will at once telegraph further.

4. We gather from your telegram that in principle you agree to the deunciation of commercial treaty  at appropriate moment and are informing Dominion Governments that there is  now general concurrence in this proposal, see my telegram II No.161 of today, in which certain further possible measures are also indicated.

My telegram M No. 151. All His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions have now concurred in our proposal to proceed at appropriate moment with denunciation of Commercial Treaty. We are accordingly informing United States Government that we propose to take this step immediately there is any overt act on the part of Japan.

2. Commonwealth Government have stressed to us importance of following up above action with intensified economic restrictions. We fully agree with this view and hope to telegraph detailed proposals as soon as we have received further indication of United States Government&apos;s intentions; see my telegram M. No.158.

3. In the meantime certain further possible measures have also occurred to us. These are (1) closing of Japanese Consulate-General at Singapore (2) placing of Ishihara and Okara on Statutory List.

4. As regards (1) we have ample evidence of improper activities of Japanese Consul General to justify this action and do not consider  that it would lead to dangerous reactions in Japan. We are however as a first step obtaining views of Governor of the Straits Settlements. Subject to his raising no objection we would propose to include this in the list of measures to be taken in the event of a Japanese move.

5. As regards (2) Ishihara is connected specially with Japanese enterprises in Malaya, and has long been suspect. Okara has always had special connections with Germany and even though Vladivostok route is at present closed there would we feel be ample justification for placing this firm the Statutory List in view of its past behaviour. These firms are of course of much less importance than Mitsui, and Mitsubishi and action could we think safely be taken against them without risk of ? effect on Japanese  policy. We have not overlooked fact that when listing of Japanese companies was considered earlier in the year as a result of my telegrams D No. 182 and D No. 237 proposal was regarded generally with disfavour, but in view of developments since that date (and of desirability of adding weight to affect of proposed denunciation of commercial treaty) we hope that Dominion Governments will now be willing to agree to this action, which we feel would have a good effect in the United States.  We are consulting His Majesty&apos;s ambassador urgently on this suggestion and should be grateful for immediate telegram indicating whether if Sir R. Craigie&apos;s advice is favorable Dominion Governments would concur in our taking this step.
