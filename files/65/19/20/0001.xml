The Prime- Minister gave the War Cabinet an account^ofhis discussions with President Roosevelt ,and of his short visit toIceland on the return journey.The President had been overjoyed at the meeting. Thegreatest cordiality had prevailed, and&apos; the Americans had missedno opportunity of identifying themselves with our cause. TheAmerican NavaL Officers had not concealed their kee,nne,ss, to enjerthe war. While.he (the Prime Minister) had had discussions withthe President on political matters, Staff discussions had proceededsimultaneously. These had been most useful, and would be reported on on a later occasion.The following were the main points dealt with in the PrimeMinisters survey.:-i By the 1st September the American Navy would have a convoy system: in full. operation between their coasts and Iceland. Thiswould afford great relief to our Naval vessels engaged;on convoyduties. This procedtire would present the enemy, with a dilemma.&apos; Either he could attack the convoys, in which.ease his U-boatswould&apos; be attacked by the American Naval forces; or he couldrefrain from attack, which would be tantamount to giving us victory in the Battle of the Atlantic.The Prime Minister explained how the idea of a Joint Declara-tion had come about, and how keen the President had been on its immediate publication. The President had been very pleased withthe new paragraph dealing with social security, suggested by theWar Cabinet, but had been somewhat reluctant to agree to the modifications in the fourth paragraph, which, in its original form,might have ruled out the continuance of Imperial Preference. He(the Prime Minister) had been most grateful to the War cabinet for having met at 1-45 a.m. on the 12th August in order to furnishhim with their comments without delay.The Prime Minister drew attention to passages in the Declara-tion which were significant of the changed attitude as comparedwith that of 1917-18. Instead of saying that there would be no more war, . we aimed at adequate precautions to prevent warhappening again by effectively disarming, our enemies. Again,instead of trying to ruin German trade, we now took the view thatthe world could not afford to see any large nation unprosperous. Itwas also important that the President should have agreed to aDeclaration which in his (the President&apos;s) phrase referred to the&quot;final destruction of Nazi tyranny.&quot;. These had not been discussed in detail, but would be taken upby Lord Beaverbrook and Mi&quot;. Harriman. The broad picture wasthat American production at present was somewhat disappointing.American industry was working to supply: their own forces, our forces, and i now those of the Russians. There would have to be a review of United States programmes, and measures would have tobe taken which would involve restrictions on civil consumption.This was not easy to enforce on a nation not at war.i The; Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet information as to: the President^ reaction to the three matters referred to in the margin. -;The discussion and Conclusions reached are recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.
The Lord Privy Seal expressed the gratitude of the WarCabinet to the Prime Minister for all that he had done. His visitrepresented a great and notable achievement.The Dominions.proposed meeting ofDominionPrime ministers and Visit ofMr. Menzies.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 82ndConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The War Cabinet had before them copies of the telegramdespatched by the Lord Privy Seal to the Prime Minister on the14th August, and of the Prime Ministers reply received on the16th August.-/-In discussion, Mr. Fraser expressed doubts whether a meeting,of Dominion Prime Ministers, if hurriedly called, would serve anyvery useful purpose, especially in the absence of Field-marshal smuts. He was convinced that no single Dominion Prime minister could possibly represent all the Dominions in the War Cabinet,more especially now that each of the Dominions was a sovereign state. Further, the Prime Minister of one of the Dominions couldnot be a permanent or semi-permanent member of the War Cabinet,since he could not continue to exercise the functions of PrimeMinister during a long absence from his own Dominion. Neverthe-less, he would welcome any arrangements which might be made for closer co-operation between the Dominions. He suggested that consideration might be given to an arrangement for holding shortmeetings at stated intervals.The Prime Minister said that, if the Prime Minister of any ofthe Dominions came to London, he would at once be invited to attend meetings of the War Cabinet regularly. If all four dominion prime Ministers found it possible to be in London at the same time,then, of course, there would be no difficulty in arranging aconference of Prime Ministers.A different situation would, however, arise if four represen-tatives of the Dominions, who were not, in effect, active PrimeMinisters, were to come to London. To invite them to enter the WarCabinet would mean an addition to numbers which would presentconsiderable difficulty, and could not bs brought about without arecasting of the machinery of government. He did not see howMinisters in this position could be asked to attend meetings of theWar Cabinet as a permanent arrangement.In discussion, it was also pointed out that the inclusion ofField-Marshal Smuts in the War Cabinet in the last war had stoodon a different footing. General Smuts (as he then was) had beenappointed a member of the War Cabinet largely on the grounds ofhis high technical qualifications. He had not been appointed as arepresentative of the Union of South Africa, nor, indeed, had he atthat time been Prime Minister of the Union.The War Cabinet expressed general agreement with these views. Having regard to the uncertainty of the politicalsituation in Australia, the Prime Minister was invited tosend a telegram to Mr. Menzies explaining to him theposition as outlined above.&apos;*Haval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 83rdConclusions,Minute 1.)3.   The Chiefs of Staff gave recent operational information.The Chief of the Air Staff explained that the losses sustained by the bomber force in the recent neavy and sustained attacks on germany (107 machines lost since the beginning of the month) hadbeen partly due to treacherous weather. There was no doubt,however, that the enemy flak and searchlights had been strengthened.
Mr. Fraser. 4.   Mr. Fraser said that this was probably the last time onwhich he would attend a Meeting of the War Cabinet on his presentvisit. He wished to express his great appreciation of the privilege of attending Meetings of the War Cabinet and to thank mostheartily all the Ministers and Chiefs of Staff for the help whichthey had given to him.The Prime Minister, in reply, said that Mr. Fraser would take with him the warmest feelings of personal friendship from all members of the War Cabinet. They had been greatly pleased tohave him among them, and they had derived confidence fromknowing that he had examined matters for himself and had been satisfied with what he had found. He hoped that Mr. Fraser would let the people of New Zealand know how much we valued not onlythe valiant aid of their troops, but also the moral support of theirspontaneous sympathy.Great George Street, S.W. 1,August 19, 1941.The Prime Minister said that our attacks should not be pressedtoo hard if the weather was unfavourable. Consideration shouldalso be given to attacking the less heavily defended centres.The War Cabinet concurred in this view.

MOST SECRET -&apos;S PILE^office-,Y.WAR CABINET 84 (41).19th Augusts 1941, 11.50 a.m.THE PRIME MINISTER gave some more general informa-tion about his visit to the United States President,over and above what is recorded in the Minutes .The Prime Minister said that he had got on intimateterms with the President.   Of the six meals they had hadtogether, five had been on the President&apos;s ship.   ThePresident had shown great activity, considering hisphysical disabilities, and on one occasion had walked(every step causing him pain) a considerable distancein front of Marines drawn up on parade, notwithstanding that his own people had advised him against doing this .The Prime Minister said that the family influence on the President was great.   Both his sons were in uniform and clearly urged him that American assistance in money and materiel was not enough.The Prime Minister gave his impression of thePresident&apos;s attitude towards the entry of the UnitedStates into the war.   He was obviously determined thatthey should come in.   On the other hand, the president had been extremely anxious about the Bill for furtherappropriations for Lease-Lend, which had, only passedwith a very narrow majority.   Clearly he was skating onpretty thin ice in his relations with Congress, which,however, he did not regard as truly representative of tteecountry,   t-p^ imaeat11 ; fee put the issue of peace and war to Congress, they would debate it for three months.The President had said that he would wage war, but notdeclare it, and that he would become more and moreprovocative.   If the Germans did not like it, they

Pull agreement had now been reached on the schemewhereby the American Navy would have their convoy system in full operation between their country and Iceland bythe 1st September.   This would release no less than 52British destroyers and corvettes now based on Halifaxfor  .convoy duty on other routes .   Each of our north atlantic convoys would be escorted by 5 U.S. destroyers,together with a capital ship or a cruiser.   The Presidentsorders to these escorts were to attack any U-boat which showed itself, even if it were 200 or 300 miles away from   the convoy.   Admiral Stark intended to carry out this order literally, and any Commander who sank a U-boatwould have his action approved.   Everything was to be done to force an &quot;incident&quot;.   This would put the enemy in the dilemma that either he could attack the convoys, in which case his U-boats would be attacked by American naval forces, or, if he refrained from attack, this would be tantamount to giving us victory in the Battle of the atlantic.    It might suit us, in six or eight weeks&apos; time,to provoke Hitler by taunting him with this difficultchoice.The Prime Minister said that he had thought it right to give the President a warning.   He had tola him that he would not answer for the consequences if russia was compelled to sue for peace and, say, by the Spring of next year,hope died in Britain that the United States were coming into the war.   The President had taken this very well, and had made it clear that he would look for an&quot;incident&quot; which would justify him in opening hostilities.Dealing with supplies for Russia, the Prime ministers aid that we might have to make some sacrifices, but thiswould be well worth while so long as the Russian frontremained in being.   When Lord Beaverbrook returned tothis country he would have to go to Moscow.   If the Foreign&apos;    -2-

Secretary also thought of going to Moscow to deal withthe more general political issues, he was sure that nothing but good would come out of the visit.   Thetechnical aspects of supplies questions should, however,he thought, be handled by Lord Beaverbrook.Great George Street, S.W.1

MOST IMMEDIATE.Prom Lord Privy Seal.ABBEY NO.  46.1. Cabinet this morning considered question of anearly meeting of four Dominion Prime Ministers in london in the following circumstances.2..     Mr. MacDonald telegraphed yesterday that Mr.Mackenzie King, who has now postponed his arrival inEngland until 21st August, had suggested that it mightbe possible to hold such a meeting at the end of August.3.     Mr. Menzies has announced publicly that providedhe can secure concurrence of Labour Party in Australia he proposes, at the request of his Cabinet colleagues, toproceed to London at a very early date to deal with the major questions of Empire policy and strategy withparticular reference apparently to the Par East.4.     Mr. fraser had intended to return very shortly to new Zealand having regard to Par Eastern situation and toimpending General Election there hut has stated that ifthere is good prospect of arranging meeting with all fourPrime Ministers he would be prepared to stay here a little;&apos;longer notwithstanding the great inconvenience which thiswould cause him.     He was emphatic that meeting should notexceed two or three days.5. General Smuts arrived Cairo August 12th and isdue to return to South Africa in a fewy days&apos;  time.6,     As two Dominion Prime Ministers have suggestedConference Cabinet felt that possibility must again beconsidered notwithstanding the practical difficulties.7.      View of Cabinet was that while time has not come for a full Conference to discuss especially post-warproblems there is something to be said for a brief meetingfor purposes of general consultation as to the war position with particular reference to Par East.     Important effecton public opinion here and in Dominions of such a Meetingfollowing on your return from meeting with president roosevelt needs no emphasis.8.     Practical difficulty exists in the time factor.You are acquainted with local difficulties in South Africawhich prevent General Smuts from being&apos; away from there forlong.     Mr. Menzies could not hope to arrive in Englandbefore end of August so that General Smuts&apos; return to south Africa would in effect be delayed for at least three weeks.

9.      Notwithstanding these difficulties the Cabinetthought that it would be right to put the matter before you and to obtain your views as to whether an approach should at once be made to General Smuts in Cairo whoseposition is clearly the determining factor.      Cabinetfavour an immediate telegram being despatched to himexplaining the situation and asking whether he could seehis way to attend such a meeting towards the end of themonth without, however, putting undue pressure on him toattend against his better judgment.1656A/14.

IMMEDIATE.TUDOR No.  36.Prime Minister to Lord Privy Seal.    ReferenceABBEY 46.1.     Menzies has only recently returned Australia,and I cannot think we should be justified in summoning himhalf round the world by air for only 3 or 4 daysconference in a fortnight&apos;s time.     He would no doubtlike invitation to join War Cabinet but this raises manycomplications about other Dominions and size of the WarCabinet.Although he is unhappy in Australia there is noother man of comparable eminence and knowledge there.2.      I doubt whether Smuts can be away from SouthAfrica for so long, and also whether we should press himto dangers of flight through Mediterranean.3.     I hope to see Fraser before he leaves but I donot think he should be pressed to stay till end of month.4.     Is it not much better to let Mackenzie Kingcome alone treating him with all the ceremony extendedto Menzies and fraser-.5.     Delay in answer due to difficulty of breakingW/T silence with many U-boats about.
