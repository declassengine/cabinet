Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 76thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.MilitaryOperations.Syria.1.   The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 698-701: Summary of aircraft losses since the 31st July : Home Theatre Enemy 10 destroyed.1 probable.5 damaged.Our Own 6 Fighters (2 pilots safe).11 Bombers.2 Coastal Command.Overseas Theatre - Enemy 6 destroyed.2 probable.5 damaged.Our Own 6 destroyed.Bombing operations had been interfered with by bad weather,but the results of our attack on Berlin had been satisfactory.Two enemy merchant vessels had been sunk in home waters by aircraft and two in the Mediterranean since the 31st July.During the last four days reports had been received of57,900 tons of shipping lost and damaged. This figure includedbelated reports, and all but 10,000 related to July.Reconnaissances had shown that Bear Island and Spitsbergenwere unoccupied by the Germans except for a MeteorologicalStation, which had been destroyed.Air personnel which had been on board one of the ships whichhad become detached from the recent Malta convoy had now reachedMalta.On the previous day a naval aircraft from ELM. Catapult ShipMaplin escorting a homeward Sierra Leone convoy had shot down a Fokke Wolfe aircraft 500 miles west of Land&apos;s End. In the samevicinity the convoy escort destroyed one U-boat and perhaps asecond.H.M.S. Hermione had rammed an Italian submarine in theMediterranean.A German merchant ship trying to make a Bay of Biscay porthad been intercepted.The handing over of the weapons of the Vichy French forces was continuing.u-S.S.R. The Germans had made little progress except in the area southof Kiev. The Russians were still fighting hard and there were no signs of a collapse, but the Germans still held the initiative. The^Russians remained&apos; optimistic about the course of the war and claimed that heavy German attacks, starting at. the end of July,had been repulsed; -with heavy, losses, and considered that thesemarked the end of the second phase of the German operations. TheRussians stated that the Germans were now attacking with infantrysupported by tanks and dive-bombers and making no furtherattempts to break through with armoured motorised formationsonly.The main German thrust was still at Smolensk, but the thrustsouth-east of Kiev appeared more dangerous.  In the Baltic States[22789] b 2 &apos;
the Germans were within some 50 miles of Leningrad.   TheRussians were reported to be evacuating Odessa.Thailand. There had been indications that the Japanese were preparing to take action in Thailand. The Japanese general mobilisation had grown to large-scale preparations, and it looked as though, if the-Russians got into serious trouble, an attack would be made onVladivostok.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Syria. 2.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the(Previous situation in Syria was disturbing.  General de Gaulle had adoptedEeference: a very difficult attitude, and there had been signs of collusionW.M. (41) 76th between him and the Vichy French in Syria.   Efforts were nowConclusions, being made to induce General de Gaulle to return to England.Minute 2.)U.S.S.R.Supply of aircraft, &amp;c.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 74thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegram No. 505 Pursaffrom Washington, which reported that theUnited States Government had no spare parts, ground equipment or ammunition (-30 calibre) for the Tomahawk aircraft which wehad agreed should be made available to Russia. It would be most fortunate if this transaction was to fall through.The Secretary of State for Air said that there was a furthercomplication inasmuch as, while the Russians in London wanted allthese aircraft delivered to Archangel, the United States insisted that the 60 which were to go from the United States should be sentto Alaska. It was impossible for us to provide spares or ground equipment for these aircraft; nor were we in a position to spareany -30 ammunition. The position at the moment was that theRussian Mission here, through their Embassy in Washington andthe British Air Mission, were endeavouring to persuade the UnitedStates Government to change their attitude and&apos; to make spares,ground equipment and ammunition available for these aircraft.The Secretary of State for Air added that he would keep theForeign Secretary in touch with developments in this matter.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Portugal.(previous reference:W.M.

Aerodromes. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theDefence Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (41) 186) containing a copy of aArrangements. Minute from the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State&apos;s reply.(Previous In discussion, comment was made on the large number of RoyalReference: Air Force personnel employed on technical duties on aerodromesW.M. (41) 7lst who were still without arms of any kind.   The War Cabinet were conclusions, assured that the need for arming these men was fully recognised.Minute 6.) -^ar Cabinet took note of this Memorandum.Parliament. 7.   Discussion took place about the proceedings in the HouseDebate on the   of Commons on the 6th August.  The intention had been that thereWar Situation,   should be a statement on the progress of the war, followed by a debate.  A suggestion had been made that, as the Prime Minister(on account of his visit to attend Naval and Military exercises)would not be available, this programme should be modified.The War Cabinet agreed that, in view of the publicity alreadyf    .. given in the Press, the proposal that there should be a statement could not be abandoned-; and,, further, that, if a statement wasmade, it would be impossible to prevent some Debate taking place.Endeavours would, however, be made to prevent the Debate from becoming too protracted.The War Cabinet accordingly Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to announce in the Houseof Commons that he would make a statement on the war situation on the 6th August.Royal Ordnance 8. The Minister of Supply said that he proposed that the factories. Dalmuir Gun Factory, which was at present administered by hisDalmuir. t Department as one of the Royal Ordnance Factories, should infuture be administered by Beardmore&apos;s on an agency basis. Thisarrangement would, of course, be terminable at short notice. this measure would be advantageous, since the factory formed part ofa group of firms in Scotland engaged on the manufacture of guns.It would also, he thought, assist in securing increased output.The measure proposed was one which he could properly take onhis own responsibility, but he thought it right to mention it to theWar Cabinet, since the decision might be criticised in some quarters.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.United States of 9. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, now that a newAmerica. Lease-Lend Appropriation Bill was coming forward, the UnitedLease-Lend. States Administration were most anxious to forestall criticisms thatwe were abusing the Lease-Lend arrangements. In particular, they feared that we might be accused (a) of using leased-lent material, which was in short supply in the United States, for our export trade;(&amp;) of allowing our merchants to make undue profits in thedistribution of leased-lent goods.A campaign in America on the former point had not been com-pletely checked by a Press statement issued by our Embassy in washington. Mr. Winant had urged that, if the Lease-LendAppropriation Bill was not to be jeopardised, we must produce aconvincing statement of our policy.
Accordingly, he (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) had seen mr. Winant on the 28th July, with the Lord President of theCouncil, the Minister of Food and Lord Portal. As a result of thismeeting, a documenBliad been prepared which followed closelyMr. Winant&apos;s suggestions. On the export trade we had felt boundto agree, subject to certain exceptions, not to allow any furtherexports, in the normal course, of goods containing materials (suchas iron or steel) for which we relied in part on the United states for our supplies, but which were subject in the United States torestriction of civilian use. These exceptions included exports under existing contracts to countries other than Empire and allied countries. Exports to Empire and Allied countries, and in special cases to other countries, which were needed for the furtherance ofour war effort, could be continued.The policy outlined above had been set out in a memorandum which had been handed to Mr. Winant, who had expressed himself as content with the steps proposed.Executive action would be necessary to carry this policy intoeffect.   The necessary Orders were being prepared, but would notbe issued until we heard that President Roosevelt had accepted the&quot;Memorandum as satisfying the needs of the occasion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was sure thathis colleagues would feel that, in the circumstances, and havingregard to the extent to which we depended upon help from theUnited States, there had been no alternative but to act on these lines.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Great George Street, S.

R.11.35 a.m. 31st July, 1941APURS 486.We have discussed paragraph (a) with censor ofBum&apos;s office who informs us that the United StatesGovernment have no ammunition, spare parts* or ground equipment for these planes.     They could, however,probably provide technicians as far as required.All the 200 Tomahawks referred to have been or willhave been paid for by us in cash.

- &apos;- MEMORANDUM.-:-:-. \1.     All materials which we obtain under the Lend-LeaseAct&apos;1 are required for the prosecution of the war effort.     this principle governs all questions of the distribution and use ofsuch goods and His Majesty&apos;s Government have taken and willcontinue to take action to secure that these goods are not in-any case diverted to the furtherance of private interests.EXPORT POLICY.2.-   No lend-leased materials sent to this country havebeen used for export.3. .  For some time past, exports from the United kingdom have been more and more confined to those essential (i) for thesupply of vital requirements of oversea countries, particularlyin the sterling Empiroj    (ii) for the acquisition of foreign exchange, particularly in the Western Hemisphere,     His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will now adopt the policy summarised below:-(i)   In the future no materials of which the use is being restricted in the United States on the grounds of short supply and of which we obtain supplies from the UnitedStated either by payment or on lend-lease terms will beused in exports with the exception of the following special cases: -(a) Material which is needed overseagln connection with supplies essential to the war effort for ourselves and our Allies, and which cannot be obtained from theUnited States,,     This would enable us (i) to exportsupplies essential to the war effort to countrieswithin the Empire and to our Allies, and (ii) to export such articles as tinplate for canning to portugal and the Argentine for our food requirements&apos;    if such tinplate could&apos; not be supplied by the UoSVAi
. o(d)   Small ^quantitieso.  such material needed as minorthough essential components;of exports which otherwiseare composed of materials not in short supply in theUnited States. .(c)   Repair parts for British machinery and plant now in use,and machinery and plant needed to complete installationsnow under construction, so long as they have alreadybeen contracted for.Steps will be taken forthwith to prevent the execution ofexisting contracts for the export (except to Empire and allied territories) of such goods which do not come withinthe exceptions referred to in (a), (b) and (c) above,(ii) Materials which are not in short supply in the UnitedStates but which we obtain on Lend-Lease terms will not beused for export in quantities greater than those which we ourselves produce or buy from any source.DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM OF LEND-LEASES GOODS.k*     The general principle followed in this matter is thatthe remuneration received by the distributors, whatever themethod of distribution, is controlled and will be no more than afair return for the services rendered in the work of distribution,,The arrangements rigorously exclude any opportunity for a speculativeprofit by private interests from dealing in lend-leased goods.     Inmost cases, lend-leased supplies will be distributed throughorganisations acting as agents of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the strict sense of the term and not as principals.     Where forstrong practical reasons this cannot be done a full explanationwill be supplied to the United States Administration and their concurrence sought beforehand   in any alternative arrangements proposed.     The justification for retaining existing channels of distribution operating under strict Government control, is that thecreation of elaborate new organisations in their place would inevitably result in loss of efficiency and the wasteful use ofman-power, and retard the war effort.
5*     Food is a special case.     Only some 5 or 6% of thetotal British food supply will come from the United Statesand without great practical complications it would be impossibleto have a separate system for the distribution of lend-leasedfood.     Food distribution is carried out in the United kingdom by wholesalers, to whom the Government sells food as principals.In fact, the Ministry of Food has established a close controlover all distributive margins so that neither the wholesalersnor the retailers receive any greater remuneration than is adequate to cover the cost of the services performed.     No foodobtained on lend-please terms is or will be sold at uneon.trolledprices,     Thus the general arrangements as regards the issueof lend-leased food fit into His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policyof stabilising the whole price level of foodstuffs, a policy to which the Government contributes  100 millions a year,6*     In some cases direct free distribution is practicable and will be adopted^     For example, some millc products (includinglend-leased supplies from the U. S.) are distributed direct and free of charge to children and others in need through schools,clinics and hospitals.     The distribution is undertaken byState agencies and the cost of the distribution is borne bythe Government,bJuly 30th. 19U1.
