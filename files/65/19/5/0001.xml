Shipping.Publication ofShipping Losses.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 63rdConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the shipping losses for June to be published on the following day would amountto about 329,000 tons.The War Cabinet-Decided that the Press should be informed, when this statement was given to them, that it was proposed to discontinue the publication of regular monthly figures infuture, but that statements would be made from time totime.It was suggested that the Minister of information should use the German statement that our losses inJune had been 800,000 tons, to show the unreliabilityof German estimates.foreign information.ProbableGerman peace offensive.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 66thConclusions,Minute .5.)Russo-PolishRelations.(previous reference :W.M. (41) 66thConclusions,Minute 5.)Ozecho-SlovakGovernment.Proposals for recognition.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 192ndConclusions,Minute 11.)3.   The Foreign Secretary gave the following information: Telegram 127, Saving, from Washington, of the 2nd July,reported that much f riendty opinion in America was concerned withthe dangers which might result if Hitler started a peace offensiveafter crushing Russia. He asked his colleagues to bear this in mindin any speeches they might make in the near future.M. Maisky had shown him that morning the Russian draft ofa proposed Agreement with Poland. This draft contained four points : First, the Russo-German Agreement of 1939 was denounced,and Poland undertook to stop anti-Russian measures. (In fact,Poland was still in a state of war with Russia.) Second, thereshould be an exchange of diplomatic representatives. Third, a polish army should be constituted in Russia and should come underthe Russian High Command. Fourth, agreement for joint actionagainst Germany.The outcome of these negotiations was uncertain.Hitherto we had recognised the Czecho-Slovak Government asa Provisional Government. Now that Russia had given full recognition, the Foreign Secretary thought that we ought to do thesame, notwithstanding the fact that the Benes Government had notthe same continuity as the other Governments of States which hadbeen occupied by Germany and had taken refuge in this country.The Governments of both the Union of South Africa and theCommonwealth of Australia, however, disliked the idea of full recognition. Full recognition, of course, did not commit us to anyparticular boundaries.The War Cabinet-Recorded the view that full recognition should now be accorded to the Czecho-Slovak Government, and invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Dominion Govern-ments accordingly, with a view to our obtaining theirassent to this course.Blockade.Danger Zones.proposed extension inBay of Biscay.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lprd of the Admiralty (W.P. (41) 157) asking that theAdmiralty should be authorised to sink snipping at sight in allwaters of the Bay of Biscay East of 120 W. and between theparallels Of 49&quot; N. and 44&quot; 15&apos; N., and that this authority shouldbe given without notifying the area as dangerous to shipping.
141W.M. 69 (41).The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal of the First Lord of the Admiralty,but took note that the Royal Air Force could not undertaketo co-operate in the action proposed, owing to the difficultyof identifying Spanish vessels from the air.Parliament. 5.   The Prime Minister said that, if Parliament met on future Mondays during the immediately following weeks, it should beArrangements, possible to adjourn for four weeks about the 7th August. After thisadjournment, Parliament might meet again for two or three days-and then adjourn for another period of three or four weeks. Therewas ample precedent for the course proposed in the practice adoptedin the last war. If need be, Parliament could, of course, be summoned back at short notice.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of thissuggestion.Production.Debate of9th/10th July.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 65thConclusions,Minute 5.)6.   A short discussion took place on the course of this Debate.The Prime Minister said that he had arranged for the points made in the speeches to be analysed and sent to the Departmentsconcerned for their comments.Reference was made in the discussion to the stoppages in pro-duction which resulted from the change-over to the manufacture ofa new type of aircraft.The Prime Minister said that he had asked that enquiriesshould be made into the possibility of continuing for longer periodsthe production of aircraft which had reached their peak.It was also suggested that some reduction might be made in thenumber of types.The War Cabinet took note of this discussion.Civil Defence.Fire-Watching.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 5thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Lord President of the Council said that he hadpresided over Meetings of Ministers to consider this subject. Theconclusion had been reached that, to put the Fire-prevention service on a satisfactory basis, emphasis must be laid more strongly than inthe past on the conception of fire-watching as a universal obligation.This would mean organising the service to conform more closely withthe Civil Defence Service.A difficulty had, however, arisen from the fact that, at the outset, an obligation to organise efficient fire-watching in factories and commercial premises had been placed on employers. This had led to the terms and conditions of fire-watching, so far as suchpremises were concerned, being regarded as a matter for industrialnegotiation; and in recent discussions with representatives ofindustry the T.U.C. had shown a disposition to press for rates of allowance based on 5s. for each tour of duty with a saving for any higher rates that might be negotiated. Any such rate wouldconflict with and disturb the rate of 3s. paid to part-time membersof the. Civil Defence Services for comparable duties. The ministers concerned Were satisfied that the right course would be to adhere tothe 3s. rate, but they thought that the War Cabinet should be aware of the position, in case the T.U.C. raised difficulties.
The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthe representatives of the T.U.C. had stated that they had no authority to negotiate on this basis, and were seeking further instructions from their General Council. He wished to be free toproceed with the institution of the necessary new measures as soonas practicable, and he asked the War Cabinet to agree to the general principle that the allowance payable for fire-prevention duties mustbe on a parity with those authorised for part-time Civil defence services.The War Cabinet approved the course proposed.Great George Street, S. W. 1,July 14, 1941.
