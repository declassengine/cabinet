45 &apos; W.M. 95 (44).U.S.S.R. 1.. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a letter^datedMoscow the 21st September, which he had sent to M. Stalin, by the hand of meeting. the Minister of Supply, in regard to aid to Russia.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 94th __Conclusions,Minute 3.)U.S.S.R. 2.   The Prime Minister said that the Soviet Government had proposed Dele- responded favourably to a suggestion from the T.U.C. that a T.U.C.gation from the delegation should visit Russia. The T.U.C. wished to send their trade Union delegation at once. If so, its visit would coincide with the MeetingCongress. with the British and U.S.A. Missions.   He had suggested toSir Walter Citrine that it would be a good plan to postpone theT.U.C. visit for a week or so, but the T.U.C. were unwilling toadopt this suggestion. It would be highly inconvenient that thetwo visits should synchronise, and the Russians might try to playoff one British delegation against the other. Further, if the visitscoincided, the T.U.C. delegation might not receive the attentionwhich was its due.The War Cabinet-(i) Agreed in principle that it was undesirable that the T.U.C.delegation should be present in Moscow, at any rate,during the first week after the arrival of the British and united States Missions, and that the departure of theT.U.C. delegation should be deferred accordingly,(ii) Invited the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to convey this decision to the T.U.C. andthe Soviet Ambassador.Man-Power.Liability to military Serviceof certain members of theOxford Group.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 92ndConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Prime Minister said that there seemed to be oon-siderable opposition to the decision as to the liability to militaryservice of certain whole-time organisers of the &quot; Oxford &quot; Group.He saw no reason, however, to modify the decision reached. Heread out a letter from Dr. Scott Lidgett, written on behalf of theFederal Council of the Free Churches, and the draft reply whichhe proposed to send, to the effect that the matter had already beenconsidered with great care by the War Cabinet, who were unableto modify their previous decision.The War Cabinet, after a short discussion, invited thePrime Minister to reply to Dr. Scott Lidgett in the terms proposed.Man-Power. 4.   The Prime Minister read a letter from Lord RiverdaleResolution transmitting a resolution passed by a meeting of employers in thepassed by heavy industries in the Sheffield district, alleging that increasingSheffield disturbance was being caused to those industries by the conflictingEmployers. man-power requirements of Government Departments. LordRiverdale, in his letter, proposed that some person should becommissioned by the Prime Minister to visit Sheffield andinvestigate the matter.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that theresolution might be prompted by the efforts which he was makingto provide manrpower for an important Ministry of Supply gunfactory, now being established in Yorkshire, and for which it wasnecessary to draw on the Sheffield and Rptherham districts. Hewould be most unwilling to agree that the movement of skilled[22940] b 2
labour should be stopped, but he would be ready to send Sir william beveridge and two or three experts to Sheffield to enquire into thematter.The Prime Minister invited the Minister of Labour and national Service to prepare a draft reply for him to send toLord Riverdale on the lines proposed.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Trade disputes act.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 89thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Prime Minister referred to discussions which had been taking place between members of the T.U.C. and representatives ofthe Conservative Party about Sections 5 and 6 of the Trade disputes act. He had written to Sir Walter Citrine inviting him to havediscussions on the matter with the Secretary of State for Air, as leader of the Liberal Party. No doubt these discussions could takeplace between persons nominated on their behalf, but the liberal party should be officially associated with them.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of these arrangements.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 94thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.U.S.S.R.6. The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 747-750 : Summary of aircraft losses since the 16th September :-Home Theatre Enemy 60 destroyed.17 probable.28 damaged.Our Own 31 fighters (4 pilots safe).4 bombers.Overseas Theatre We had destroyed 4 enemy machines and lost 2.In addition to the above losses, some 15 bombers had crashedin this country on the night of the 18th September owing to wide-spread fog descending unexpectedly when 145 of our aeroplanes hadbeen air-borne.In home waters our aircraft had hit 9 enemy ships. Inaddition, on the 18th September successful attacks on Flak ships had been made by fighter aircraft, 6 being destroyed.In the Mediterranean our aircraft had hit three ships. Fiveattacks had been carried out against submarines, two of which hadbeen promising.During the previous four days we had lost six ships totalling35,000 tons. Belated reports had been received of the loss of three ships totalling 17,000 tons.The main development in the Russian situation had been thefall of Kiev. The enemy claimed the capture of 150,000 Russians,but Russian forces were thought to be still fighting in the Kievarea, although surrounded. To the East the Germans had capturedPoltava and were advancing on Kharkov. In Finland, german attacks on Murmansk had been held and the immediate dangerappeared to be averted. The Germans, claimed to be making progress on the north-eastern part of the island of Gesel, and had capturedMoon and Worms Islands. The morale of the garrison at Leningradwas high.  All land communications with the Crimea had been cut.
Aid to Russia.Debate inParliament.Attitude of thePress.7. The Prime Minister said that, when Parliament met, itmight be necessary to disclose in Secret Session the steps taken tosend supplies to Russia.The view was generally expressed that this would be desirable,even if not strongly urged. If the matter was discussed in secret session and Members were satisfied with the assurances given, thiswould have a favourable effect on public opinion generally.Attention was also drawn to a number of unfavourable articles in the Press, and to a statement made by Mr. John Gordon in a news-reel film.     vThe Minister of Information explained the steps which he hadtaken to bring pressure on the Cinema Company concerned to discontinue the undesirable statements made in this news-reel.As regards the Press, it was agreed that the Minister ofInformation should again see the Editors. The difficulty was,however, that one or two newspapers had deliberately adopted apolicy of attacking the Government, as they believed that such apolicy resulted in increasing their circulations.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Persia.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 94thConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Foreign Secretary said that the ex-Shah of Persia wason his way to India or to a port, and that the suggestion was thathe should then go to Mauritius.The Foreign Secretary read to the War Cabinet a statement,which he proposed to discuss with the Soviet Ambassador as to theterms of the Treaty of Alliance to be concluded between the UnitedKingdom, the Soviet Union and Persia, The draft covered thefollowing points : (a) An undertaking to respect Persia&apos;s territorial integrity and political independence and to protect her by all means at our command against aggression by germany or her associates.(b) Co-operation by the Shah of Persia and the Persian forcesin fulfilment of this undertaking.(c) The unrestricted right to the Allied Powers to use andcontrol means of communication through Persia.(d) The maintenance by the Allies of military forces in Persia,subject to withdrawal on the conclusion of the peace, ora year after the conclusion of ah armistice.(e) An undertaking  by the Persian  Government not tomaintain diplomatic relations with any State not indiplomatic relations with either of the Allied Powers.(/) The Allied Powers to use their best endeavours to provide some form of economic assistance to Persia.The War Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to proceed with discussionof a Treaty on the lines proposed.Libya. The object of the recent German &quot; reconnaissance in force &quot;into Egypt had probably been to discover the British strength inthe forward area and whether our armoured forces would be in aposition to intervene effectively in any attack on Tobruk. Therewere indications that the German and Italian forces were endeavouring to force the siege of Tobruk. ,The War Cabinet took note of these statements.0
U.S.S.R.Caucasian Oil.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 85thConclusions,Minute 7.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the paymaster-General (W.P. (41) 224).A record of the discussion and of the Conclusions reached is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Great George Street, S. W. 1,September 22, 1941.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether it wouldbe desirable in this case to adopt the procedure whichhad been adopted in the case of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty when both France and this country had signed separate Treaties with/Turkey.
21 Septembers 1941.My dear Premier Stalin,The British and American Missions have nowstarted, and this letter will be presented to youby Lord Beaverbrook.    Lord Beaverbrook has thefullest confidence of the Cabinet, and is oneof my oldest and most intimate friends.   He has established the closest relations with Mr.Harriman,who is a remarkable American, wholeheartedly0devoted to the victory of the common cause.They will lay before you all that we have beenable to arrange in much anxious consultation between Great Britain and the United States.President Roosevelt has decided that our proposals shall, in the first instance, dealwith the monthly quotas we shall send to you inthe nine months period from October 1941 toJune 1942 inclusive.    You have the right to

know exactly what we can deliver month bymonth in order that you may handle yourreserves to the best advantage.Hie American proposals have not yetgone beyond the end of June 1942, but I haveno doubt that considerably larger quotascan be furnished by both countriesthereafter, and you may be sure we shalldo our utmost to repair as far as possiblethe grievous curtailments which your wartheindustries have suffered through/Naziinvasion.   I will not anticipate what LordBeaverbrook will have to say upon thissubject.You will realise that the quotas upto the end of June 1942 are supplied almostentirely out of British production, orproduction which the United States would have

given us under our own purchases or underthe Lease and Lend Bill.   The united states were resolved Jso give us virtually thewhole of their exportable surplus, and itis not easy for them within that timeto%pen out effectively new sources ofsupply.    I am hopeful that a furthergreat impulse will be given to theproduction of the United States, and that by 1943 the mighty industry of Americawill be in full war swing.   For our part,we shall not only make substantially increased contributions from our ownexisting forecast production, but also try to obtain from our people an extra further effort to meet our common needs.   You willunderstand, however, that our Army and itssupply which has been planned is perhaps onlyone-fifth or one-sixth as large as that of

4- 173of yours or Germany1s.   our first duty and need is to keep open the seas, and our second duty isto obtain decisive superiority in the Air.   these have the first claims upon the man power of our44,000,000 in the British Islands.   We can neverhope to have an Army or Army munitions industriescomparable to those of the great Continentalmilitary powers.   None the less, we will do our utmost to aid you.General Jsmay, who is my personal representative on the Chiefs of the Staff*s committee, and asthoroughly acquainted with the whole field of our military policy, is authorised to study with yourCommanders any plans for practical cooperationwhich may suggest themselves.If we can clear our western flank in Libyaof the enemy, we shall have considerable forces,both Air and Army, to cooperate upon the southernflank of the Bus si an front.O

- 5 -It seems to me that the most speedy and effective help would come if Turkey could be induced to resist a German demand for the passage of troopsor better still, if she would enter the war on our side.    You will I am sure attach due weight to this.I have always shared your sympathy for theChinese people in their struggle to defend theirnative land against Japanese aggression.   Naturallywe do not want to add Japan to the side of our foes,but the attitude of the United States, resulting fromBy conference with President Roosevelt, has alreadyenforced a far more sober view upon the JapaneseGovernment.     I made haste to declare on behalf ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government that should the UnitedStates be involved in war with Japan, Great britain would immediately range herself on her side.     Ithink that all our three countries should, so far aspossible, continue to give aid to China, and thatthis may go to considerable lengths without provokinga Japanese declaration of war.

There is no doubt that a long period ofstruggle and suffering lies before our peoples, butI have great hopes that the United States will enter the war as a belligerent, and if so, I cannot doubtthat we have but to endure to conquer.I am hopeful that as the war continues, thegreat masses of the peoples of the British Empire,the Soviet Union, the United States and China, which alone comprise two-thirds of the entire human race,may be found marching together against theirpersecutors;   and I am sure the road they travelwill lead to victory.With heartfelt wishes for the success of theRussian Armies, and of the ruin of the Nazi tyrants,Believe me,Yours sincerely,(SB.) WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.His ExcellencyMonsier Joseph Stalin.

- MOST SECRET -W.M. (41) 95SWEDEN.(Reference:elegrams65, 567,568, 570,571 and 572from sweden to theForeignOffice.)THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat a scheme had been devised to repeat the coup carried,out some time ago when a number of ships had left Swedishports for this country carrying with them war material ofconsiderably importance to our war effort.   The GermanGovernment had become aware of the scheme, and threatenedSweden with the direst consequences if the ships were allowed to leave.   The Secretary-General of the SwedishForeign Office had. informed our Minister at Stockholm(telegram 568) that the Swedish Government were neverthe-less not prepared to yield to German threats in this matter.The question at issue, therefore, was whether we thoughtthat it was in our interest that the German Governmentshould declare war on Sweden as a result of these shipsleaving Gothenburg.A further consideration which must be borne inmind, was that while WIr Boheman, the Secretary-General, had made it clear that in his personal view no Swedish Govern-ment should yield to the German threats on this matter,the Swedish Government themselves might not adopt so firman attitude.    It was, therefore, undesirable that we shoulddelay an answer too long.   The question therefore arosewhat action we could take to help Sweden if war broke outwith Germany .THE PRIME MINISTER said that this was a matter which must be discussed by the Defence Committee and bythe Chiefs of Staff.   We should have to be in a positionto say what action we could take.   The matter must betreated with the greatest secrecy.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY agreed, and said that,apart from the Chiefs of Staffs aspect of the matter, itwould, be necessary to decide whether we intended, to proceedwith the project of these ships leaving Gothenburg.Great George Street, S.W.1,22nd September, 1941.
