It was thought that the canal and the port would both be out of action for vessels of any size forsome time.Wing Commander D. R. Bader, D.S.O., who had been reported missing, was a prisoner in German hands.During the previous three days 2,800 tons of shipping hadbeen lost.H.M. Submarine Regent had sunk by gunfire, south ofBenghazi, a schooner laden with petrol and stores, and hadbombarded Apollonia.The latest reports from Russia were not encouraging.

Vichy France. It was possible that the new disciplinary measures and other changes announced in Marshal Petain&apos;s broadcast were due to internal conditions in Vichy France and did not necessarily involve further steps in the foreign field, e.g., the cession of bases in north africa.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements,discussions between thePrime Ministerand president roosevelt.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 81stConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The War Cabinet were informed of the arrangements madefor the Lord Privy Seal to broadcast, at 3 p.m. that afternoon, theStatement agreed between the President of the United States andthe Prime Minister, and embodying the Joint Declaration?&apos;&quot;Mr. Mackenzie King had sent a telegram, asking whether a reference to his forthcoming visit to the United Kingdom could beincluded in the Lord Privy seal&apos;s broadcast.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to telegraph to Mr. Mackenzie King explaining that this wasimpossible, as the text of the Statement had been agreed between the President and the Prime Minister, butinforming him that a statement as to his visit would beissued for publication in Friday* morning^ Press.The Dominions.proposed meeting ofDominion PrimeMinisters.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 58thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs read to hiscolleagues a telegram from the United Kingdom High Commis-sioner in Canada (No. 1228). Mr. Mackenzie King had telephonedto the High Commissioner to say that the Prime Minister &apos;s talks with President Roosevelt had created a situation in which it mightbe of great advantage for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers tomeet in Imperial Conference, and suggesting that a meeting mightbe possible in London in the last week of August.A telegram had also been received from the United kingdom high Commissioner in Australia (No. 291) reporting thatMr. Menzies had announced publicly that, provided he could securethe concurrence of the Labour Party, he proposed, at the request ofhis Cabinet colleagues, to proceed to London at a very early date. -;.Field-Marshal Smuts had arrived in Cairo on the 12th august and was due to return to South Africa in a few days. In June hehad informed us that he did not see how he could be away from south Africa for long owing to the internal situation.Mr. Mackenzie King had now postponed his departure from canada to the 19th or 20th.Mr. Fraser said that he had planned to catch the &quot; Clipper &quot;from Los Angeles on the 23rd August on his return journey to NewZealand, but he had hoped so to arrange matters that he could see Mr. Mackenzie King and also the Prime Minister before leaving.In view of the Far Eastern position, he was anxious to return to new Zealand as soon as possible. There was also the complicationof the forthcoming election, which could not be postponed. Never-theless, if it was the general view that it would be desirable thatthere should be a meeting of the Dominion Prime Ministers, hewould be; prepared to stay here longer, notwithstanding the personalinconvenience. He was emphatic that any meeting held should notexceed two or three days.* Altered to Saturday after the conclusion of the meeting.Xnd  -fiuic 7^ Uy rf  Arid
War Cabinet.future arrangements.5. The Lord Privy Seal proposed that provisional arrange-ments should be made for a Special Meeting of the War Cabinet tobe held on Tuesday, the 19th August, at 5 p.m., to hear the PrimeMinister^ account of his discussions immediately on his return.The time of this Meeting might, of course, have to be altered.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Great George Street, S.W. 1,August 14, 1941.It was agreed that the determining factor was whether Field-Marshal Smuts could find time to come to this country.In further discussion, Mr. Fraser referred to the article inThe Times of the 13th August, putting forward the view that atleast one front-rank statesman from the Dominions should beincluded in the War Cabinet. He did not see how the PrimeMinister of one of the Dominions could enter into any arrangement which would involve so long an absence from his own Dominion.If there was occasion for so long an absence, some other minister would have to be chosen.Mr. Fraser also said that he thought no single Dominionstatesman could adequately represent all the Dominions. Theposition would not, in his view, be accepted in the Dominions.Indeed, the inclusion in the War Cabinet of a single Minister fromthe Dominions might give rise to difficulties.In further discussion, the view was generally expressed thatit would be a pity to arrange for the four Dominion Prime ministers to come to London for a meeting unless there was adequate material for discussion. It was felt, however, that the Prime Ministersconversations with President Roosevelt offered a notable occasion for such a meeting, and that there was much to be said fordiscussion with the Dominion Prime Ministers at this stage of thewar situation generally, with particular reference to the Far East.It would, however, be better to describe the meeting as a &quot; Consul-tation of the Dominion Prime Ministers &quot; and to avoid the term&quot; Imperial Conference.&quot;The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to send atelegram to the Prime Minister setting out the views ofthe War Cabinet. The telegram should indicate that thebalance of opinion was in favour of an immediate invita-tion being sent to Field-Marshal Smuts explaining theposition, and asking whether he could see his way toattend such a meeting, but without putting undue pressure on him to attend such a meeting against his betterjudgment if it would involve him in serious difficulties,having regard to the political situation in South Africa.

Text of The Lord Privy Seal13 broadcast on 14th August. 1941.mI have come to tell you about an important meeting betweenthe President of the United States and the Prime Minister whichhas taken place and of a declaration of principles which hasbeen agreed between them.     Here is the statement which theyhave agreed to issue:-The President of the United States and the Prime Minister,Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty&apos;s Government in UnitedKingdom, have met at sea.They have been accompanied by officials of their two Governments,including high-ranking officers of their military, naval and air services.The whole problem of supply of munitions of war, as providedby the Lease-Lend Act, for the armed forces of the United Statesand for those countries actively engaged in resisting aggressionhas been further examined.Lord Beaverbrook, the Minister of Supply of the BritishGovernment, has joined in these conferences.     He is going toproceed to Washington to discuss further details with appropriateofficials of the United States Government.     These conferenceswill also cover the supply problem of the Soviet Union.The President and the Prime Minister have had several conferencesThey have considered the dangers to world civilization arisingfrom the policy of military domination by conquest upon which theHitlerite Government of Germany and other Governments associatedtherewith have embarked, and they have made clear the steps which their countries are respectively taking for their safety infacing these dangers.I will now read to you the joint declaration which they haveagreed upon.     It runs as followsThe President of the United States and the Prime Minister,Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make knowncertain common principles in the national policies of theirrespective countries on which they base their hopes for a betterfuture for the world.First, their countries seek no aggrandisement, territorial orother.Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do notaccord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned.Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose theform of Government under which they will live;    and they wish tosee sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who havebeen forcibly deprived of them.Fourth, they will endeavour, with due respect for theirexisting obligations, to further the enjoyment by all States, greator small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to thetrade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed fortheir economic prosperity.Fifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field, with the object ofsecuring for all, improved labour standards, economic advancementand social security.Sixth, after the final destruction of Nazi tyranny, they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations themeans of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries, andwhich will afford assurance that all the men in all the lands maylive out their lives in freedom from fear and want.Seventh, such a peace should enable all men to traverse thehigh sease and oceans without hindrance.

Eighth, they believe all of the nations of the world, forrealistic as well as spiritual reasons, must come to theabandonment of the use of force.     Since no future peace can bemaintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be employedby nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside oftheir frontiers, they believe, pending the establishment of a widerand permanent system of general security, that the disarmamentof such nations is essential.     They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armament.
