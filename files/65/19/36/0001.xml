The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 761-764 : Summary of aircraft losses since the 2nd October : ;Home Theatre Enemy 11 destroyed.3 probable.4 damaged.Our Own 7 Fighters (1 pilot safe).1 Bomber.2 Coastal Command.Overseas Theatre Enemy 1 destroyed.5 damaged.Our Own 6 destroyed.4 damaged.Since the previous Cabinet 25,000 tons of shipping had beenreported lost, of which half represented belated reports.A tanker had been mined and sunk in the Suez Canal, but the canal had only been partially blocked. Our submarines had carriedout a successful attack on a convoy west of Sicily.In the north the Russians were satisfied with the situation, butthe Murmansk railway had been cut at Petrozavodsk. On the leningrad sector there bad been no important change. In thecentral sector a drive against Moscow had begun. The three mainthrusts seemed to be (a) East or North-East of Smolensk;(b) East of Roslavl; and(c) Towards Orel.The German attack towards Kharkov was meeting with strongresistance. Further South there were indications of considerableGerman advances east and south-east of Dniepropetrovsk.The Polish Commander-in-Chief, General Anders, had painteda serious picture of the general Russian situation, and said that marshall Budenny had been relieved of his command.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.U.S.S.R. 2.&apos;   The Prime Minister read a telegram from the Minister of moscow Supply  (No.  39,  Linen/ giving  the  results  of  the  MoscowMeeting. Conference, which must be regarded as highly satisfactory.  It was(Previous clear that, from the Russian point of view, the only thing which reference:        counted was the early arrival in Russia of supplies under theW.M. (41) 98th  Agreement.

A short discussion took place, and is recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.4. A discussion took place, and is recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave thefollowing information: Owing to delays on the Russian side, no progress had been madewith the Anglo-Russian Treaty with Persia. Now that the moscow conference was over, he looked for an improvement.Our relations with Switzerland threatened to deteriorate owingto our recent blockade measures, and to the R.A.F. nights over thecountry. Was it necessary to fly over Switzerland in order to bombGenoa ?The Chief of the Air Staff said that he was taking measureswhich he hoped would minimise the latter cause of friction.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 99thConclusions,Minute 6.)Parliament.By-elections.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 98thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Minister of Home Security reported that there hadbeen a sharp attack on Tyneside on the night of the 2nd-3rd October. Some damage had been done to shipbuilding and otherindustries and about seventy people had been killed. There hadbeen other minor coastal raids.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.7. The Prime Minister referred to the statement made at theCabinet a week earlier that it was important that government speakers should go down to the constituencies in which the by-elections were being held. He thought, however, that it was important to maintain the normal rule whereby War cabinet ministers, and other Ministers of Cabinet rank in the peace-timesense, did not make speeches at by-elections.The War Cabinet endorsed this view.TheSenussi. 8.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (41) 232).The Chief of the Imperial General Staff doubted the wisdom of the proposal to transfer two battalions of the British Senussii Force for service in Syria.   The Foreign Secretary said that hewould look into this point. - A
The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal that an early declaration should bemade to Saiyid Idris in the following sense : (1) His Majesty&apos;s Government welcome the association ofhis forces with their own in the task of defeatingtheir common enemies.(2) At the end of the war he and his followers will in no circumstances   be   again   placed   under   Italiandomination.Germany. 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theProposed Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (41) 233) proposingdeclaration that this country and the Allied Governments should issue a formalregarding collective  declaration  concerning  German  action  in  occupiedGerman territory.atrocities. The view generally expressed in discussion was that, if adeclaration on the lines proposed was made, it should lead up to a somewhat more definite conclusion. For example, it might end bya statement that we did not believe that the world in general would allow those who were responsible for these atrocities to gounpunished. Steps were therefore being taken to compile carefullists not only of the leaders who were responsible, for German policyin this matter, but also of those who were foremost in aiding andabetting them in these atrocities. People in the enemy-occupied countries were being asked to take steps to forward these lists tothis country by such means as were available.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to redraft the declaration in the light of the discussion which had taken place, andto circulate it to the War Cabinet.Wheat.DraftInternationalAgreement.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 97thConclusions,Minute 9.)10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (G) (41) 107), to which was attached a summary of revised instructions for the United kingdom delegation and a note on Consideration under the Lease-Lend Act.The main point raised by the Lord Presidents memorandum was whether we should now go forward with an attempt to concludean Agreement dealing separately with the single problem of wheat,or whether we should seek to persuade the Americans that thenegotiations for a Wheat Agreement should stand over until further progress had been made in settling the general lines of anglo-American co-operation over the whole field of post-war economic problems.In discussion it was urged that, while there was much to besaid in favour of the latter course, it might seem to the Americansa sudden reversal of policy, and might give rise to serious misunder-standing. The Foreign Secretary suggested that it might bedesirable to sound Lord Halifax before any communication on theabove lines was sent to the United States.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : -(1) The Chancellor of the Exchequer was invited to collaborate with the Foreign Secretary and the Minister without portfolio in preparing a draft letter on the following lines :-(a) We were anxious to conclude an Agreement forth-with about a Belief Pool for post-war relief.
(b) As matters had developed, it would be better toreach some agreement on the general framework of Anglo-American collaboration in regard to post-war economic problems generally beforeattempting to reach conclusions on the treatmentof particular commodities. The negotiations onthe Wheat Agreement should be handled on thisfooting.(c) We saw grave political difficulties in any proposal which looked like imposing restrictions on wheatproduction in European countries as the price of immediate post-war relief.(2) This draft should be submitted as soon as possible to thePrime Minister, who would then take an early oppor-tunity of discussing the matter with Mr. Winant, andwould consider whether Lord Halifax should be consulted before he sent a personal communication onthese lines to President Roosevelt.(3) In the meantime, action should be suspended on the issueof revised instructions to the United Kingdom Dele-gation.Parliament.Proposeddebate on production.11. The Prime Minister said that suggestions had been made that another Debate on Production should take place in about afortnights time. This was much too soon after the last Debate.The reply to these, and similar representations, should be that theGovernment deprecated the suggestion that there should be anotherDebate so soon. If, however, the proposal for a Debate was pressed,then the reply should be that we should not, of course, object to a debate taking place, but that Government representatives wouldnot be able to take any strong part in it.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of thissuggestion.Parliament.Bill to extendDuration of thepresentParliament.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 87thConclusions,Minute 10.)12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (W.P. (G) (41) 106). The Memorandum dealt witha number of points which might be raised on the Second Reading ofthe Prolongation of Parliament Bill, 1941. 1&quot;The Home Secretary explained that some of the points dealtwith in the Memorandum were likely to be ruled out of order. Themain point likely to be raised was the state of the register, theshifts of population, &amp;c. He thought that there was much to besaid for setting on foot an Inquiry as to the possibility of devisingmachinery which could be used quickly if and when a GeneralElection became imminent.In discussion, the view was expressed that it would be undesirable to have a General Election immediately after fightingceased and before the Peace Conference had been held. There would thus be time to deal with these questions of electoral reform afterthe war.On the other hand, it was urged that meanwhile circumstances might arise in which it would be embarrassing to be in a positionin which it would be impossible to have a General Election becausethe machinery requisite for this purpose had not been examined.The War Cabinet decided as follows : (1) The Home Secretary should confine any assurances givenin the Debate on the Bill as nearly as possible to what had been said in the Debate on the 1940 Bill.
(2) After the Bill had been passed, the Home Secretary shouldtake steps to institute an Inquiry into the machinerythat would be necessary if circumstances should renderan early Election desirable. This Inquiry should,however, be carried out with the minimum of publicity.Armistice Day.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 272ndConclusions,Minute 6.)13. The Home Secretary reminded the War Cabinet that ayear ago there had been no Two Minutes&apos; Silence on Armistice Day.Poppies had been sold on that day, and a few wreaths had been laidofficially on the Cenotaph.A suggestion had been brought to his notice that, besidesobserving the Two Minutes&apos; Silence this year in this country, weshould endeavour to secure its observance by as many as possible of the peoples of the enemy-occupied countries. While he waspersonally doubtful of the wisdom of this suggestion, he thought heshould bring it to the notice of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet decided against this suggestion, and agreed that the procedure on Armistice Day, 1941, should follow the procedure of a year ago.The Home Secretary was invited to make the necessary arrangements accordingly.international labour conference.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 87thConclusions,Minute 8.)14. The Prime Minister said that the International LabourOffice Conference which was to be held on the 27th October wouldbe attended by President Roosevelt. In view of the importance of theoccasion, he proposed that the Lord Privy Seal should represent HisMajesty&apos;s Government. The Lord Privy Seal could take this opportunity of giving an explanation to President Roosevelt ofcertain criticisms, which had been brought to the Presidents noticeby American representatives who had visited the Middle East, inregard to our arrangements in that area. The Departmentsconcerned should co-operate in providing the Lord Privy Seal withthe fullest information on these matters.The War Cabinet-(1) Noted the arrangements proposed with approval, and invited the Prime Minister to announce the appointmentof the Lord Privy Seal as the representative of HisMajesty&apos;s Government at the International LabourOffice Conference on the following day, in reply to aPrivate Notice Question.(2) Agreed that it would be desirable that the Lord Privy Sealshould also pay a short visit to Canada, but that no announcement should be made on this point until shortly before his departure.Great George Street, S. W. 1,October 6, 1941.

LORD BEAVERBROOK (NOCOP).FROM BRITISH SUPPLY MISSION MOSCOW TO FOREIGN OFFICE.Lord Beaverbrook.No. 59 LINEN.3rd October, 19V1.MOST IMMEDIATE.D.   1.06 a.m. &amp;tli October,19^-1.R.   1.10 a.m. Ith October, 1941.wvvvvvFollowing for Prime Minister from Lord Beaverbrook.MOST SECRET.I have signed as chairman of delegation of Great Britaina document entitled &quot;The confidential protocol of theConference of Representatives of Great Britain, United States,and U.S.S.R.11    Others have signed too.The document provides for a contribution of supplies&quot;which will be made available at British and American centres of production&quot;.&quot;Great Britain and the United States will give aid totransportation of these materials to the Soviet Union and will help with the delivery&quot;.Document provides for almost everything that has beenagreed to heretofore, and in addition 200 Bren carriers mountedwith machine guns.    The 25 pounders, the Bren guns and theSten guns have been eliminated, and there is no mention of the20% of the anticipated production to be expressed in actualfigures.     The fate of the 23,000 Tommy guns promised byAmerica out of our allocations remains in doubt.    These arenot mentioned in the agreement.Several promises are made to conform with the possibilityof providing other supplies, but these can be dealt with on myreturn.7/e are permitted to supply as much as 50% of our tanks inthe form of light tanks.In raw materials the only commitment not previously madeis 1,500 tons of zinc which would have been agreed to in any event.    The United States promised to provide half, subjectto the consent of their Government.    Electrolytic copper is increased by 2,000 tons but delivery has been spread over the nine months instead of one delivery of 25,000 tons.The effect of this agreement has been an immense strengthening of the morale of Moscow.    The maintenance of this morale will depend upon delivery.     If there is a heavy failure in Octoberthen the situation will in our opinion deteriorate.     In thisview .....Y&quot;

view I am supported by Captain Balfour. General Ismay,General Macready and Sir Archibald Rowlands.   Now will youplease direct that a continuing flow of tanks and aircraftreach Archangel early in this month of October.     It will be satisfactory if first monthly 200 Hurricanes, some of themwith cannon guns, reach Archangel and another 200 tanks inaddition to everything that has gone before.    Arrival isthe only test.     Despatch means nothing to Russians.     It isclear that the Americans will be delayed on account of thelong transportation.     But Harriman is sending telegrams tothe President and to Hopkins explaining the situation and inexactly similar terms.I do not regard the military situation here as safe forthe Y/inter months.     I do think that morale might make it safe.Shipping instructions excluding tanks and air planes willbe sent to the Ministry of Supply and the War Office direct.It is essential that the fact that we have not increased the contributions agreed on before the Mission \ia.s formedshould not become the subject of comment.     The Russians are under the impression that we have done the very biggest thingfor them which could be imagined and we hold to the sane view.Any writing down of this optimistic opinion in Britain willdamage the framework of our agreement, which is Russian morale.The newspapers should help us.v

PROLONGATION OP PARLIAMENT.Speaker1s ruling.(See Minute 12.)The Prolongation of Parliament Bill doesnot provide an opportunity for discussing the functicof Parliament, or the record of this Parliament inparticular, or the relations between the two Houses,or redistribution, Electoral reform or a newSpeaker&apos;s conference,  (all of which were attempted tobe raised in the debate last year).      But it doesgive an opportunity of calling attention to the stateof the register, shifts of population etc. which affect by-elections, and the representative characterof the existing House of Commons.
