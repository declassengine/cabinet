NwaMlilitar, 1    The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in operations.       amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos 712-715 :-Summary of aircraft losses since the 14th August :-(previous reference:W.M. (41) 82ndConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.U.S.S.E.Home Theatre Enemy 42 destroyed.8 probable.19 damaged..Our Own 12 fighters.31 bombers.2 Coastal Command.Overseas Theatre Enemy 1 probable.5 damaged.Our Own 9 destroyed (of which 4 were destroyed on theground).A discussion took place on our recent losses of bomber aircraft.The War Cabinet called for a report from the Secretaryof State for Air and the Minister of Aircraft production on the number of bombers available for service and thepresent rate of bomber production.Investigations had been ordered into the two recent disastersto Trans-Atlantic aircraft, in the second of which Mr. Purvis had lost his life.During the previous four days our R.A.F. and F.A.A. aircraft had hit three enemy vessels at home and eight in the Mediterranean.One of the vessels hit in the Mediterranean was an Italiandestroyer, which had almost certainly been sunk.The Italian s.s. Stella had been captured in the CentralAtlantic by ELM. Armed Merchant Cruiser Circassia and was beingtaken in to Bermuda.The German s.s. nor deney had been intercepted in the CentralAtlantic, but had been scuttled.Two of our corvettes had been in action against U-boats. Inthe first case, the corvette had been sunk. In the second case, theU-boat had been sunk.During the previous four days 2,700 tons of shipping had been lost.There had been heavy fighting on the northern and centralfronts, but little movement. On the southern front the germans had made considerable progress and looked like overrunning all theterritory west of the big loop in the River Dnieper. Nikolaev wasin German hands and Odessa cut off. Kiev was still held by theRussians. The Germans had reached Krivoi Rog, which producedabout 60 per cent, of all Soviet iron-ore.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
Blockade.Proposed Inter-eeption ofKseortedFrench Convoy.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War Cabinetinformation as to the orders issued, after consultation with theForeign Secretary, with a view to intercepting an important VichyFrench convoy which might be escorted by a cruiser.The orders to our vessels were only to take action if we were inoverwhelming force.The War Cabinet took note with approval of the issue ofthese orders.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (41) 75thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Minister of Home Security said that there had been afew minor raids over this country during the last few days. minor damage had been done at Broadstairs and Lowestoft on the night of the 16th August, and at Hull on the night of the 17th August.He enquired whether it would be possible to provide increasedfighter protection for our coastal towns during the autumn and winter.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to look into this.Foreign Affairs.Vichy France.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 82ndConclusions,Minute 2.)Persia.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 82ndConclusions,Minute 2.)The Far Bast.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 81stConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave thefollowing information: It was still thought that internal difficulties were responsiblefor the recent decisions announced by Marshal Petain, and thatthere was no immediate danger of the cession to Germany of bases in North Africa. It seemed, however, that the Vichy Governmentwere mainly influenced by fear of public opinion in France. Theywould therefore try to obtain concessions from Germany, and it looked as though there was some danger of a Franco-German Treatyof Peace within the next few months. The Vichy Parliament hadbeen called for the end of September.The British and Russian Ambassadors in Tehran had now presented their Memoranda to the Persian Government, who had agreed to answer within three days.The Defence Committee (Operations) had been considering that afternoon the instructions to be given to His Majesty&apos;s Minister in tehran in the event of the Persian reply being unsatisfactory. no final decision would be taken until His Majesty&apos;s Government had had time to consider the Persian reply.If it became necessary to take strong measures against Persia,a further reassuring message would be sent to the TurkishGovernment.The War Cabinet took note of certain further information relating to the position in the Far East. This is recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.5.   Mr. Fraser referred to the importance of doing all in our power to give Air help to China.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that we had done a great deal in agreeing to the release of American aircraft.A demand had now been made by the Chungking Government that.M. (41) 71st we should send them pilots.   This request, he thought, we mustConclusions,      certainly refuse.  The most helpful thing that we could do would minute 7.)       be to take steps to hasten the arrival in China of, the american aircraft.Clhina.international air Force.(PreviousHeference
The Allies. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theProposed Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (41) 195). * TheMeeting on Memorandum proposed that a Meeting should be held towards thePost-War end of August, to which representatives of all the Allies should beEuropean Needs, invited, and to which a Resolution should be submitted for formalapproval, inviting them to co-operate in measures to secure suppliesof foodstuffs and raw materials for post-war needs.In discussion, it was pointed out that the Resolution referredto the territories of the Allied Governments. Clearly, each of theGovernments concerned must put forward its demands on somespecific basis, which could only be its pre-war territories. At thesame time, it was undesirable to include in a public Resolutionphrases which might be interpreted as implying a commitment to restore the pre-war boundaries of each of the Allied Governments.Hitherto we had avoided any such commitment.To meet this point, the Resolution might be amended asfollows : (a) Paragraph   1. For   &quot;their   territories&quot;   read   &quot;thecountries liberated from Nazi aggression.&quot;X&quot; I        (b) Paragraph 2. For &quot;territories&quot; read &quot;peoples.&quot;(c) Paragraph 4. Delete &quot; for the reprovisioning of itsterritories.&quot;The question was also raised whether a Meeting of the AlliedGovernments, if held so soon after the Prime Ministers return fromhis discussions with President Roosevelt, should be limited topassing a Resolution dealing with the reprovisioning of Europeafter the war; or whether it should not also have before it aResolution associating the Allied Governments with the joint declaration made by the Prime Minister and President Roosevelt.The War Cabinet-(1) Gave general approval to the proposal to hold a Meeting ofAllied Governments at an early date, at which a Resolu-tion would be passed dealing with the supplies of foodstuffs and raw materials for post-war needs.(2) Approved the terms of the draft Resolution as set out in w.P. (41) 195, subject to the amendments at &quot;X&quot;above.(3) Agreed that, before the arrangements for the Meeting were finally settled, the Foreign Secretary should consult thePrime Minister as to the matters to be dealt with at theMeeting.\The Chief of the Air Staff said that the instructions given bythe War Cabinet had been interpreted somewhat narrowly by theauthorities on the spot in regard to the extent to which operational training could be carried out in Burma. The Chiefs of Staffproposed to recommend a relaxation which would permit this.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
Oil.Miri (Sarawak)and Seria(Brunei) DenialScheme.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 21stConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies setting out a revised scheme for putting in force the Oil Denial Scheme (W.P. (41) 193).The revised scheme was a thoroughgoing scheme of demolition.Complete discretion was given to the Commander-in-Chief, China,to put it into effect on his own responsibility at any time if, in hisopinion, Japanese actions in the neighbourhood made this advisable.If it was necessary to authorise the scheme to be put into forcebefore the issue of the warning telegram, the Colonial Secretary,after obtaining the concurrence of the Admiralty, would seek theauthority of the Prime Minister. If it was necessary to sendinstructions after the issue of the warning telegram, these would beissued without further reference to the War Cabinet or the PrimeMinister, but with the concurrence of the Admiralty.The War Cabinet-Approved the revised scheme set out in the Memorandum(W.P. (41) 193).Great George Street, S.W. 1,August 18, 1941.
