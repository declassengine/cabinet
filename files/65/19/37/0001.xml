Parliament. 1.   A short discussion took place arising out of the Debate onDebate on        Man-power in the House of Commons on the previous day.Man-power. ^he Minister of Labour and National Service said thatconflicting claims had made the calling up of further man-power sodifficult, that he thought it would be worth while to take the Houseinto the Governments confidence in the matter and to give them the picture in broad outline in Secret Session. For example, they mightbe given the totals employed in the three Services together, on munitions, on Civil Defence Services and on such vital services asrailways, the mercantile marine and the docks. Useful comparisonscould be given, with corresponding figures at the end of the last warand at the beginning of the present war.General agreement was expressed with this view.The Prime Minister asked the Minister of Labour and NationalService to send him a short note, giving an analysis of the man-power position under, say, 12 or 15 heads.The Press.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 98thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. Reference was made to a recent article in the Daily Mirrorwhich contained a violent attack on Spain.The Prime Minister said that it was clearly contrary to thenational interest that articles which increased the risk of Spaincoming into the war against us should be published. If persuasionwas useless, we must arm ourselves with the necessary powers.  &apos;It was suggested that to obtain the necessary powers wouldmean making a new order under the existing Defence Regulation.The War Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, the Minister of information and the Home Secretary to consult together on this matterand to report to the War Cabinet.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M.

The Prime Minister said there were indications that public opinion in Ireland would be gratified if some action was taken which acknowledged the considerable help which we were receivingby the enlistment in our forces of volunteers from Southern Ireland.He had asked the Secretary of State for War to consider the forma-tion of an Irish Brigade. He would be grateful if the Home and dominions Secretaries would examine,. from their -points of view,the position il men from Southern Ireland, who enlisted in this&quot;Brigade, took the Oath of Allegiance.
(previous reference:conclusions minute 9.)Germany. 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theGerman Foreign Secretary (W.P. (41) 235) containing a revised draft of theAtrocities.        declaration which it was proposed should be made.The Minister of Economic Warfare suggested! that in the las&quot;tsentence but one should be included an explicit reference to theW.M. (41) 100th fact that lists were being compiled of those who were guilty of thesebrutalities.The Foreign Secretary said that he would much prefer in thedeclaration not to include a reference to the compilation of lists.But he had no objection to reference being made in our propaganda to the fact that the compilation of lists was being encouraged andundertaken.This was agreed to.The War Cabinet-Approved the draft declaration, subject to minor drafting amendments, and authorised the Foreign Secretary toarrange for its circulation to the Dominion and AlliedGovernments.The Blackout.LightingRestrictionsand ShoppingFacilities.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 91stConclusions,Minute 9.)10. In the course of a general discussion, the Prime minister referred to the importance of securing all possible easements whilethe present relative immunity from air attack continued.The War Cabinet were reminded that an announcement hadbeen made, some two weeks earlier, on the steps taken to improve the lighting of certain vehicles. As regards street lighting, the HomeSecretary had explained to the House that morning the reasons whyno return to a modified pre-war system of street lighting was practicable.The hours of closing of shops had been very carefully considered. The decision reached had been based largely on the traffic problem. Shops in certain central urban areas might be closed early when local circumstances required such action in orderto leave the transport facilities free for the workers. Considerablediscretion had been left to the authorities in the matter and localconsultation would precede any such action. When no trafficproblem was involved shops would in general close at 6 p.m. and at-30 p.m. on the late night with a possibility of local variation.No formal conclusion was recorded. The upshot of thediscussion may, however, be summarised as follows: There was no reason to suggest that the conclusions reached on the above matters should now be reconsidered.But we must be ready to adjust our policy to meet thesituation as it exists from time to time, and the position must be kept under review. All practicable steps should betaken which would make the general conditions less onerousfor the people of this country during the following winter.Great George Street, S.W. 1,October 9, 1941.

AnyWheat Agreement capable of this construction would in ourview be dangerous in the extreme.     It would supply Nazipropaganda with a weapon which it would hot be slow to use.It would arouse widespread suspicions as to the spirit inwhich the United States and the United Kingdom mean to use their power when the war is over and would confuse anddishearten the elements in Europe now hoping and working forthe defeat of Germany.     We regard it as essential therefore,to remove from the draft agreement all provisions implyingAnglo-American interference In European Agricultural policy.The relation of Russia to any agreement also raises a difficulty,    Russia was still a neutral at the time when thearrangements&quot; for the Wheat Conference were made.     But, as things are now, It appears to us virtually out of the questioneither to conclude an agreement which may seriously affecther interests without consulting her, or to approach her onsuch/
such a matter: at a time when she is engaged in a life anddeath struggle, and when her richest wheatfields are in the battle area,,We have been considering what instructions we can give to our delegates, who are now on their way to Washington,with a view to meeting these difficulties, but we have notbeen able to find a really satisfactory solution consistent with the present framework of the draft agreement.    Considerablerevision would certainly be required;   and we are alive to thedanger, which we are anxious to avoid, of protractednegotiations which might lead to a breakdown.     For our part,we welcome the proposals for establishing a pool of wheat for post-war relief.    There are other important features of theagreement, which do not prejudice, or which could easily begiven a form which would not prejudice, the interests ofunpresented countries,.e.go the agreement of the fourexporting countries represented as to the ratios of theirrespective export quotas., and the provision for an &quot;ever-normal&quot; granary..The other issues of policy might usefully be exploredby the Conference with a view to preparing the ground for later decisions;   but it seems to me that we should be.ill-advised to attempt to reach definite conclusions about thesenows    Apart from the fact that important countries not represented at the Conference are affected, there seems.to be advantage in trying to fit these questions into the largerdiscussions on Anglo-American collaboration in regard to post-war economic problems generally which,.as Lord Halifax will be.able to explain more fully, we hope to be able to begin atan early date.If.you agree generally with my view, I will instructour delegation accordingly.individual.
