They had met with considerable opposition.

The record is - contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The German thrust into the bend of the Dnieper had nowsecured all territory west of that river, with the exception ofOdessa, where Russian sailors had been putting up a strong;defence.  Kherson had fallen.   So far as was known, the Germans/had not yet succeeded in establishing bridgeheads on the east banl&amp;of the Dnieper.  Further to the north the Germans, striking south-wards, had cut the Briansk-Brest-Litovsk Railway at Gomel andwere endeavouring to cut off the Russians in the Gomel-Kerosten-Kiev salient.   Should this thrust succeed, the Germans would alsoprobably capture Kiev, besides turning the Dnieper and preventingany possibility of a Russian counter-attack against the germans in the Dnieper bend.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.[22849]The War 1.

The Minister of Supply gave the War Cabinet an accountPublic Opinion   of the impressions which he had formed, during his recent visit toand Supplies.     the United States, of the attitude of that country to the war, andof the supply position, fLord Halifax also gave the War Cabinet his views on publicopinion in the United States.In the discussion which followed, the view was generallyexpressed that public opinion in the United States was ratherstatic, and that, failing some new development, the position inregard to supplies to this country from the United States mightnot develop favourably.Preliminary consideration was given to the question whether there was any action which we could take to bring about a develop-ment of events in the United States of America more favourable to ourselves, but no conclusion was reached.foreign information.Persia.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thePersian Minister had been to see him that morning, and had putforward the suggestion that the Persian Government should expelall foreigners from certain Provinces to be selected by us. He (theForeign Secretary) had replied that he could not discuss the matter further with the Persian Minister, and that he should advise hisGovernment to accept the terms which would be offered that day after our forces had entered Persia.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it was clear that Germany intended to exercise the maximum pressure on Turkey during the next few weeks. Our Ambassador at Ankaraproposed to ask for an interview with the President, in the courseof which he would make use of a Memorandum prepared by theChiefs of Staff, dealing with the military situation generally.The Foreign Secretary thought that it would be of advantage if, in the Staff talks with Turkey which were to be conductedthrough our Attaches, we could be rather more specific than hadbeen contemplated in the previous instructions, as to the extent ofthe fighter force which we could make available to Turkey. he asked that this point should be considered by the Chiefs of Staff.The War Cabinet invited the Chiefs of Staff to consider this point.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theRussians had indicated that, while they were in general agreementwith the Joint Declaration by the Prime Minister and president roosevelt, they wished to have some discussion with us about it before associating themselves with it publicly. In the circum-stances, he (the Foreign Secretary) had decided that the Meetingof the Allies provisionally arranged for Wednesday, the27th August, should be postponed for a fortnight.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.U.S.S.R.proposed mission to moscow todeal with supplies.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theRussians were anxious that the Meeting in Moscow of representa-tives of Russia, Great Britain and the United States decided upon in the conversations with President Roosevelt should be held assoon as possible. The 15th September was suggested, but it seemeddoubtful whether the United States representative would beavailable as soon as that date.
Censorship.United StatesCorrespondents.The War Cabinet-Agreed with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal that heshould consult Mr. Winant on this matter, should explain that the Russians were pressing for the date to be fixed,and should invite the views of the United StatesGovernment.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that some difficulty had arisen over the week-end in regard to statements, castin the form of speculation, sent to the United States by an AmericanPress Correspondent in this country purporting to report what had passed between President Roosevelt and the Prime Minister as to persia and Indo-China.The question at issue was whether the Censorship Regulationsdealing with speculations on the part of Press Correspondentsshould be tightened up, or whether the matter should be dealt withby the Minister of Information taking steps to have messages fromthe particular individual concerned specially watched.The War Cabinet favoured the latter course.The Far east the BurmaBoad.(previous reference erence:8. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff setting out what action they advised in the event of a japanese attempt to cut the Burma Road (W.P. (41) 131).The Secretary of State for Burma said that the developmentof the North-West route into China via Digboy, referred to in w.M. (41) 75th paragraph 4 of the Report, would take years to complete, and would conclusions,      then only be suitable for pack transport.

(41) 74thConclusions,Minute 1.)10. The Minister of War Transport reported that the negotia-tions with the Chairmen of the four Main Line Companies and ofthe London Passenger Transport Board had now reached a conclusion. The Chairmen had now agreed to recommend to theirBoards, at meetings called for Thursday, acceptance of a revisionof the existing settlement on the lines set out below.The first Agreement had provided for a minimum guarantee to these five Undertakings of  39-4 millions per annum, with fullprofit participation thereafter up to  43 millions, and fifty-fiftywith the Government beyond this figure.
It had also provided that fares and charges should be advanced to cover increasing costs, and, because these had not been able to be sanctioned by the Government, following the Chancellor&apos;s firstannouncement on stabilisation, the railways had a claim for a&quot; lag &quot; up to the end of 1940 of some  13,000,000.The special war damage compensation in the present Agree-ment would also have to be withdrawn, and the Governments war damage scheme, as applied to public utility undertakings generally,substituted therefor. - This was much less satisfactory to theRailway Companies, and they estimated the adverse difference tothem at not less than  2^ millions annually.In place of all the foregoing, the Companies had now agreed toaccept a fixed annual payment of  43 millions as from the1st January, 1941, subject to confirmation by their Boards. Thiswas Exclusive of the interest on capital issued or redeemed since the base period.The War Cabinet were informed that the Lord presidents committee had considered this settlement, and were of opinion thatit was a very satisfactory achievement to have secured that theRailway Chairmen should recommend to their Boards acceptanceof these terms, rather than, as had been their first intention, thatthey should ask that these terms should be imposed upon them.The War Cabinet-Took note with approval of the settlement reached in thismatter.Great George Street, S.W. 1,August 25, 1941.
W.M.UD 86. Minute 525th August, 1941.At the request of the Prime Minister, $HE MINISTEROP SUPPLY gave the War Cabinet an account of his impres-tions in the United States.On the political side, he said that he did notthink that there was much chance of the United Statescoming into the war in the immediate future.   There wasno doubt that the whole Administration were in favour of going to war, and were committed to help and support us .They were, however, waiting on the temper of american public opinion.   The Republican Party was voting againstthe A Ministration, and he feared that this attitudemight, result in a situation in which they voted againstentry into the war.As regards the supply situation, he thought that production generally in the United States was on a goodbasis, but that it would need a very considerabledevelopment before any great increase could take place.One point which required constant watching was thetendency of the United States authorities to divertelsewhere supplies of munitions resulting from orders which we had ourselves placed before the Lease-LendAct had been passed.   There was no prospect of obtainingany appreciable volume of supplies under the Lease-Lendprocedure in the near future.   The immediate task was&quot;to obtain delivery of the material ordered by us undercontracts which we had placed before the Lease-Lend Acthad. been introduced.   There were several recent cases in which such supplies had been diverted to China orto Russia.   Allocation of supplies was entirely the concern of the President, but he had to contend withthe demands put forward by the United States Army,

which resisted allocations being made to us until theythems elves were properly equipped.As regards food supplies, the Department ofAgriculture in the United States was not very forthcoming,and required guidance from the President.   As a result ofthe   rise in wages, consumer demands in the United states were growing, and there was a grave risk that it might affect the supply .of food to this country.LORD HALIFAX sai-* that there was not much which heneed add to the Minister of Supply&apos;s statement.   He agreedthat the President and all the principal members of theAdministration were anxious to come into the war, andwould be relieved if some incident, such as the torpedoingof an American ship, precipitated this event.   He thought,however, that latterly public opinion in the States hadbeen largely static.   A small proportion, say 10 or 15&amp;,had been anxious to enter the war at once.   At the otherend of the scale, another small proportion, say 10 or 15^,never wished to come into the war.   The middle block ofopinion was tired of the endless discussion and was prepared to follow any strong lead.    It was significant that the occupation of Iceland had not resulted in any criticism worth speaking of.   Lord Halifax thought thatthe President was perhaps unnecessarily prudent aboutnot putting too great a strain on American public opinion.He had, however, handled the situation so well that itwould be a mistake to criticise him.Lord Halifax said that the procedure of making available to this country supplies by means of Appropria-tions under the Lease-Lend Act had. been upset by thedemands of the American Services for their own needs .This could^only be overcome by action taken by thePresident or by Mr Harry Hopkins.

Lord Halifax paid a tribute to the excellent work done by Sir Arthur Salter, who had been greatly supportedby the Maritime Commission.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed his anxieties aboutthe position.   The United States public was being calledupon to put up with all the inconveniences of war withoutthe stimulus of being at war.   He sometimes wondered whether the President realised the risk which tiwy were running by keeping out of the war.    If Germany beatRussia to a standstill ano the United States had made nofurther advance towards entry into the war, there was agreat danger that the war mierht take a turn against us.While no doubt we could hope to keep going, this was avery different matter from imposing our will on NaziG ermany.THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY thought that it was important that some steps should be taken to resolve the presentdeadlock.    In his view we should not hesitate to takedrastic action to resolve the present impasse..Mr MACKENZIE KING said that in estimating theposition it must be borne in mind that the President hadall along taken the line of telling his people that hewas doing his best to keep them out of the war.   Evenhis statement to Japan had been based on the protectionof U.S. interests.   President Roosevelt had the supportboth of those who wanted, to get America into the warand those who wanted America to keep out.   It would therefore be very rash for us to attempt action in orderto force American public opinion.In the discussion which followed, various sugges-tions were made as to possible courses of action whichmight exercise a favourable influence on American publicopinion.   One such suggestion, put forward by

Lord Halifax, &quot;was that the Prime Minister should saydefinitely to President Roosevelt that we saw no prospectof being able to crush the Nazi regime unless Americacame into the war.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had said thisquite definitely to President Roosevelt on several occasions.   He had told him that he had rather theUnited. States came into the war now^ and^we got no moresupplies1 from the United States for six months, thanfthat supplies from the United States should be double **the U.S.A. kept out of the war.LORD HALIFAX then suggested, that the Prime minister might ask President Roosevelt privately whether he would welcome a public statement being made to this effect bythe Prime Minister.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had. in effect already said this publicly.   He recalled a declaration that there could be no satisfactory peace unless the United states was a party t o it.In discussion, it was pointed out that American opinion was perhaps apt to attach particular importanceto the Prime Minister&apos;s statement &quot;G-ive us the tools and we will finish the job&quot;.LORD HALIFAX added that the Prime Minister&apos;sstatements had as much, if not more, effect in theUnited States, as those made by the President.The War Cabinet were reminded by the PRIME MINISTERof the arrangement whereby the United States was to takeover thejirork of patrol and escorting our convoys as faras Iceland.   This might bring about developments whichwould affect the position materially.Another point of view put forward by THE SECRETARYOF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS, was that while publicopinion   generally in this country was most anxious that

America should, enter into the war, there was aconspiracy of silence for fear of hurting Americansusceptibilities.   Would it not be worthwhileconsidering whether there could not be some discreetand. partial relaxation of this self-imposed ban?The view generally expressed was that this wouldrequire to be done very judiciously, or it would befraught with danger.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL suggested thatthe anxieties of the supply situation, voiced by theMinister of Supply, might make a convenient starting-point for an approach to the President, and might be linked up with the line of approach suggested by lord halifax.A suggestion was also made that an approach mightbe made on the Labour side, an* the Minister of Labourand. National Service might go and see Mr Lewis.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR referred to the arrangementsfor Labour Day on 1st September, which might resultin great support for our war effort.Finally, a suggestion was made that any kind of approach on the lines suggested would come more easilyfrom one of the Dominions, particularly Canada, than from this country.THE PRIME MINISTER said he thought that the matterrequired considerable further reflection, and that noconclusion should be reached, that day by the War CabinetGreat George Street, S.W.I.
