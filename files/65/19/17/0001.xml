discussions between thePrime Ministerand president roosevelt.Proposed draft declaration.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 80thConclusions.)1. The War Cabinet resumed discussion of the terms of theproposed Joint Declaration, and had before them a further telegramfrom the Prime Minister (Tudor No. 20)f This telegram, whichhad crossed telegram Abbey No. -31, said that the President had accepted the amendments proposed by the Prime Minister in his telegram Tudor No. 15.Discussion turned mainly on the terms of paragraph 4 of thedraft Declaration. The War Cabinet had before them three texts of this paragraph : (a) The text in Tudor No. 16, as amended in Tudor No. 15.(b) The text in Abbey No. 31 drafted by the War Cabinetearlier that morning at a Meeting at which, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade had not been present.(c) The following text put forward by the Chancellor of theExchequer: &apos;&apos; Fourth. They will endeavour, with duerespect to their existing obligations (or engage-ments), to further, within the limits of theirgoverning economic conditions, the progressiveattainment of a well-balanced internationaleconomy, which would render unnecessary policies of discrimination and other impediments to thefreedom of trade.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to the words&quot; without discrimination&quot; in the Presidents draft. when mr. Keynes had been in the United States he had had two or threeinterviews with President Roosevelt, when they had discussedstatements on &quot; consideration &quot; in respect of supplies to us underthe Lease-Lend Act. It appeared that the United states authorities had not proposed to ask for any payment for articlespassing to us under the Lease-Lend Act. This, however, had beencoupled with a provision &quot;against discrimination in the UnitedStates of America or the United Kingdom against the importationof any produce originating in the other country.&quot;The Chancellor referred to conversations which Mr. Achesonhad had with Mr, Keynes. The former had expressed a personal view that a continuance of Imperial Preference would be incom-patible with an undertaking of this kind. Mr. Acheson had saidthat it was not clear whether the undertaking would rule out import and exchange control. He had thought that these technical matters were probably not present to President roosevelt&apos;s mind.Since Mr. Keynes&apos;s return to this country he (the Chancellorof the Exchequer) had had discussions with a number of theMinisters concerned. He read to the War Cabinet an extract froma letter from the Secretary of State for India, which stressed theimportance of not permitting any doubt as to our right and deter-mination to pursue a policy of inter-Imperial preference.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that thegreatest danger of all was the American desire to stop this countrymaintaining exchange control after the end of the war.The War Cabinet reached the following Conclusion : A reply should be sent to the Prime Minister stating thatthe War Cabinet preferred the alternative draft of para-graph 4 set out in Abbey No. 31, and giving their reasons. If,however, the Prime Minister would find great difficulty inobtaining acceptance of this revised draft, the War cabinet were prepared to accept the President&apos;^ draft, subject to thePrime Ministers amendments.6 .f.0*) toj.b 2ttjf   tu

(41) 79thConclusions,Minute 2.)Great importance was attached to the new paragraph,dealing with social security, for insertion between paragraphs 5 and 5.These views are embodied in telegram Abbey No. 35?*The War Cabinet had before them telegram Tudor No. 18/*&quot;The Foreign Secretary said that, while he was not altogetherhappy about this proposal, he thought no action was called for bythe War Cabinet in regard to it.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The War Cabinet had before them telegram Tudor No. 19f&quot;together with a telegram from Mr. Menzies (No. 553), repeated tothe Prime Minister as Abbey No. 34.&apos;The War Cabinet expressed cordial approval of the advancemarked by this telegram.  They agreed (a) That the substance of the first four paragraphs should besent to the Dominion Prime Ministers.(&amp;) That no action should be taken at present to inform theDutch or Soviet Governments,(c) That the Prime Minister should be informed in the abovesense.Holidays.Civil ServiceLeave.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 78thConclusions,Minute 5.)&apos;X&apos;*2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to the difficulty which had been mentioned at the meeting referred to in the margin,that, if a second week&apos;s leave was granted to Civil Servantsemployed in munition factories, including, for example, certaininspectorial staffs, this might give rise to difficulties in respect ofthe work-people and staffs employed in such factories. He had beenin consultation with the Supply Ministers. The Minister of supply had seen objection to granting a second week&apos;s leave to these CivilService staffs; none of the other Supply Ministers anticipateddifficulty in dealing with this matter.The Chancellor said that the Treasury proposed to deal withthe point in a circular which had been prepared for issue to Depart-ments in the following way : &quot; The position of non-industrial Civil Servants employed in munition, &amp;c, factories will require special consideration by theDepartments concerned. Generally speaking, non-industrial staff employed in industry should not be given leave in excess of that given to the non-industrial staff in private employment in the sameestablishment. In the case of Government establishments whichare primarily industrial, the further week will be given within the discretion of the Department.&quot;The War Cabinet agreed that this difficulty should bedealt with as proposed at &quot; X.&quot;Ao3*
