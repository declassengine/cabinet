Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 75thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.Shipping Losses.Northern waters.MilitaryOperations.U.S.S.E.1. The Chiefs of Staff gave the following information in amplification of Cabinet War Room Records Nos. 695-697 : Summary of aircraft losses since the 28th July: In home theatres our fighters had probably destroyed one enemy aircraft; we had lost 11 bombers.Overseas Theatres Enemy 39 destroyed on the ground (confirmed by photo-graphs).7 probable.7 damaged.Our Own 2 fighters.Five small enemy vessels, totalling 6,000 tons, together with a mine-sweeper and a trawler, had been sunk by air action.During the last three days we had received particulars of two ships, totalling 4,000 tons, which had been sunk, one by submarine and one by aircraft.It was also known that a convoy had been attacked on the29th July in the South Atlantic. Full details had not yet beenreceived. The Germans claimed to have sunk l7 ships, and it wasfairly certain that 10 had been sunk, mostly of small tonnage.The Prime Minister said that this attack on the SouthernAtlantic route would almost certainly be followed by others. Assoon as American plans matured, we should bring back destroyers and corvettes now based on Halifax to protect this route.Aircraft from H.M.S. Victorious had carried out an attack onKirkenes on the previous evening. Two hits had been claimed onthe Bremse, a depot-ship with four 5-inch guns. Four merchant ships had also been hit. At the same time aircraft from.M.S. Furious had attacked Petsamo, but had found little hoattack there. In these two operations we had lost 12 torpedoaircraft and 4 fighters.These losses were probably due to the Swordfish aircraft havingcome up against fighter opposition.The First Lord of the Admiralty was invited to report onthe steps being taken to provide fighter aircraft with adequate performance for use on aircraft-carriers.The following information had been supplied to General MasonMacf arlane by the Russian General Staff: in the Murmansk area the Germans &quot;were being easily held, and the situation at lake ladoga was under control. The general Russian position was con-sidered to be strong and the Germans had suffered heavy casualtiesas a result of Russian counter-attacks. According to other sources,however, the Russian counter-attacks had died down. although there were German forces North-East of Smolensk, some russian forces were still holding out in Smolensk itself. The only region inwhich the Germans were making steady progress was the drive ina South-Easterly direction South of Kiev.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.[22775]
Middle East. 2.   General Auchinleck and Air Marshal Tedder gave to the(Previous War Cabinet an appreciation of the military and air situation in reference: the Middle East. A record is contained in the Secretary&apos;s StandardW.M. (41) 73rd File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Conclusions,Minute 2.)--- :-U.S.S.R.Supply of WarMaterial.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 75thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a telegram which he had despatched to M. Stalin, informing him that steps were being taken to send 10,000 tons of rubber to Russia from thiscountry.The First Sea Lord was invited to make suitable arrange-ments for the escort of the convoy carrying this rubber.Russo-PolishAgreement.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 75thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The War Cabinet congratulated the Foreign Secretary onhis part in having brought about the conclusion of this Agreement,which had now been signed. The Polish Foreign Secretary, whowas violently anti-Russian, had resigned, and it seemed that thePresident might adopt the same course.Iran (Persia). 5,   The War Cabinet were informed of the measures proposed(Previous to bring pressure to bear on the Iranian Government to expel the reference: German community now in their country.    The discussion revise.M. (41) 75th recorded in  the  Secretary&apos;s  Standard File  of  War  cabinet conclusions, Conclusions.Minute 4.)The GermanCommunity.Oil requirementsof the Iranian government.&apos;A&quot;The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to TehranTelegram No. 471, reporting that the Iranian Ministry of War had ordered the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to deliver them 2 million gallons of petrol, at the rate of 400,000 gallons a week, with priority over all other orders. This would seriously interfere with thebuilding up of a reserve by the British authorities in Iraq.The Foreign Secretary said that, acting under instructions from the Foreign Office, the Headquarters of the Company inLondon had telegraphed to their officials in Iran that the Iranianauthorities should not be supplied without approval from london with quantities which would interfere with British service requirements.In discussion, it was pointed out that this would only lead tothe issue being raised almost immediately between the Governments.Our right course was to gain time. The Company should take action which would gain time, e.g., by allowing &quot;the IranianMinistry of War to have certain small supplies, which the lattermight take as an earnest of our intention to comply with their demand.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to ask the Anglo-iranian oil Company to act oh the lines suggested at &quot;A.&quot;
The Far East.Japan.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 75thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that,although, at the outset, the United States had taken a firm line infreezing Japanese assets, there were now indications that, whilebringing to an end special trade and war supplies, they mightintend to allow normal trade with Japan to continue.The Foreign Secretary thought that it was both dangerous andunwise to follow a bold decision by feeble and ineffective action.We, at any rate, should enforce the freezing Order strictly, and onlygrant licences in the exceptional cases where it was in the interestsof our war effort to do so.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the Far EasternCommittee to proceed on this basis, and to give an intima-tion of our views to the United States authorities.The Far East.Co-operationwith the UnitedStates ofAmerica.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 75thConclusions,Minute 6.)Thailand.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad further considered the line of approach to be made to theUnited States Government. He thought that it should include two points. First, whether the United States, Government would under-take that, if we or the Netherlands Government became involvedin war with Japan, they would come to our aid. Secondly, whetherthe United States, the Dutch, the Dominion Governments and ourselves should make representations, joint or parallel, to Japan,warning her that any further action inimical to our interests would lead to trouble, and including aggression against Thailand withinthe scope of this declaration.The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to discuss thismatter very frankly with the American Ambassador that evening,and, if he agreed, to make an immediate approach to the UnitedStates Government on the lines suggested.The War Cabinet approved the course proposed.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, now that the Japanese menace was drawing nearer, the Thai Govern-ment were snowing signs of turning to us for help, and asking what we could do for them if they resisted Japanese pressure.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should reply on thelines that, while at the present moment there was littlethat we could do directly to help the Thais, we were inconsultation with other Powers, notably the United States,as to joint measures to restrain any further Japaneseencroachments.Great Georae Street, S.W. 1,July 31, 1941.
