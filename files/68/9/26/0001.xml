1 0 1 &amp; 0THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1942.SECRET.W.P. (R) (42) 26.May 26. 1942.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 1942 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.General Position.DURING the early part of April Indian affairs occupied a considerable proportion of the attention of Canadians. The complexities of the Indiansituation were only gradually appreciated : once they were, criticism gave wayto approval of the United Kingdom Governments proposals and to exasperationwith the Indians. Prominence was given to the intervention of the United States,and the presentation of news oscillated between hope and despair until the finalbreakdown of negotiations. It was thought that nothing had been lost bySir Stafford Cripps&apos; mission, and many newspapers were of the opinion that india had lost &quot; a great opportunity &quot; by turning clown the United Kingdomproposals.   After the breakdown of negotiations interest soon died away.2. Agitation in favour of a &quot; second front&quot; has tended to increase. Theraids on St. Nazaire, Narvik and Boulogne were welcomed, although they were regarded as insufficient. The visit of Mr. Hopkins and General Marshall to thiscountry led to the belief that an aggressive policy was favoured by theUnited States, which would be adopted by the United Kingdom. IncreasedR.A.F. raids, together with the continued Russian&apos; advances, produced a feeling of confidence which fostered the demand for such a policy. Lord Beaverbrook&apos;sspeech was widely endorsed, and it was felt that the Allies must attack soon inorder to relieve the Russians and preserve their striking power. Some sectionsof the press deplored the tendency to discuss high strategy in public, and emphasised the need for a secure Atlantic route as a supply line before anyinvasion of the Continent was undertaken.3. The United Kingdom budget aroused general admiration, and there was much praise generally for the United Kingdom war effort as reflected in thebudget; several editorials eulogising the &quot; arsenal of resistance &quot; which &quot; savedthe world.&quot;4. With the return to power of Laval, France formed the main topic ofinterest for a time. Almost all press comment was gloomy, with the exception ofsome French-Canadian newspapers, which Avere optimistic over the composition of Laval&apos;s Cabinet, and thought that collaboration with the Axis would belimited. Most of the French-Canadian press, however, expressed sympathy forthe French people.[23852] copy No.71
5. The position of the Free French is gradually improving, and somenewspapers, hitherto relatively neutral in the matter, are now actively supporting the Free French Committee in Canada.6. The plebiscite (see report for March) which was held on the 27th April,was the main item of local interest during the month. The campaign wasacrimonious, and there was much confusion over the actual issues involved, inspite of the efforts of the Canadian Government to keep the public mind clear onthe question at stake. The result of the plebiscite was a large majority in favourof releasing the Government from its pledge in eight Provinces, in Quebec,despite the appeal of Mr. St. Laurent urging all French Canadians to vote &quot; yes &quot;and to abandon the illusive dream of a French State in America, there was a72 per cent, majority for &quot; no.&quot; The net result was an all-over majority for&quot; yes &quot; of about 63 per cent, of the votes cast.7. There is no exhilaration among most of the &apos;; yes &quot; voters in their victory;rather, they are appalled at the difficulties of the situation now facing them.Already some sections of the press have broken their temporary truce witnAir. Mackenzie King, and are heaping violent recriminations on him for havingcaused the plebiscite to be held. In view of the conflicting statements made by cabinet Ministers and others during the campaign, the public regards it as an open question whether the vote should be interpreted as a vote of confidence inthe Government. This situation remains, in spite of a statement by Mr. mackenzie king on the eve of the poll that he would not regard the verdict as such a vote.8. The Acting High Commissioner, in summing up the situation which has arisen as a result of the voting, fears that the forecast for the Parliamentarybarometer is stormy. The French press, and the citizens of Quebec Province,rightly or wrongly, regarded the vote as one for or against conscription, and thePrime Minister will have to exercise all his ingenuity to allay the discontentwhich has arisen in Quebec at the prospect of action following the plebiscite vote.9. A few strikes, fortunately of brief duration, occurred during April, themost important dispute being in the shipbuilding industry.Naval, Military and Air Activities.10. During March. U-boats continued their attacks on unescorted shippingalong the Atlantic seaboard, particularly in the vicinity of Cape Hatteras;approximately fifty ships, of which about half were tankers, with a total tonnageof about 320.000. were sunk in the Western Atlantic, as against 57 ships, witha total tonnage of 307.405. in February. As FJ-boats have continued to concen-trate their attacks almost entirely on unescorted ships, few anti-submarinecounter-attacks were reported.11. The King and Queen inspected the 5th Canadian Armoured Divisionon the 24th April.&apos;The 2nd Canadian Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment was in action againstfour enemy aircraft at Newhaven on the evening of the 23rd March; there were no Canadian casualties.12. The only R.C.A.F. squadrons which did not take part in operations during the month Avere two army co-operation squadrons and two others whichwere not yet operational. The R.C.A.F. fighter squadrons were repeatedlyemployed in escort duties and sweeps over enemy territory, but no enemy aircraft were definitely accounted for. Bomber squadrons 408 (Hampdens), 419 (Welling-tons) and 428 (Hampdens) all had a busy month. They took part in several raiclsover the Ruhr and in all the important and successful attacks, including those on Rostock and the Paris factories; they also carried out sea mine laying. three aircraft of 408 Squadron and two of 419 Squadron were lost during April.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.General Position.13. Indications that the Japanese are preparing to strike next at Indiarather than at Australia have led to a feeling of relief, which is in danger ofturning into complacency. The continued R.A.A.F. raids on New Guinea, thesuccessful defence of Darwin against air raids, and the confidence inspired by
the presence of United States troops have all, in fact, combined to produceoptimism. The United States air attacks on Japan were received with delight,and have encouraged the feeling that the tide has turned and that the Allies have begun to take the initiative in the Pacific. The press has tried to discourage thisoptimism, and has criticised Cabinet Ministers for exaggerating the militarysignificance of the United States raid on the Philippines. Though the situationirTBurma is regarded with grave anxiety, even this has not prevented a feelingbordering on complacency.14. The events leading up to Sir Stafford Cripps&apos;s mission to India were followed with interest, but, in view of the complexities of the situation, withimperfect understanding. The Indians were criticised for lacking realism, andfor their incapacity to unite in the face of danger. The final breakdown of negotiations was regarded as disappointing, and it was generally felt that theUnited Kingdom Government had clone all in their power by making a generousoffer, which Indians of all classes would have been wise to accept.15. Though the carping criticism of the United Kingdom has by no meansdied down, articles on the United Kingdom war effort have done much to repairthe damage caused by the reported ineffectiveness of British strategy in the far east, and the tone of the press has, on the whole, been friendly recently.Mr. Curtin was praised for his attempts to arrest the campaign against thiscountry, his broadcast speech being thought to &quot; bring out the essential unity ofthe English-speaking world,&quot; and as giving Australia &quot;a model on which tobuild its defence.&quot; The Melbourne Herald, however, featured an articlecriticising the way in which the Commonwealth Government have conducted their overseas relationships, and stating that &quot; the ground lost can be regained by national Goveimments of broader vision and experience.&quot;16. R.A.F. raids on Germany and German-occupied territory were regarded as encouraging, and, together with General MarshalEs visit to thiscountry, led to speculation about the opening &quot;up of a &quot;second front.&quot; Therehas been considerable demand for such an attack in order to relieve Russia, whofor nine months has held the main enemy. The press, however, has maintaineda cautious attitude on this, and reaction to Lord Beaverbrook&apos;s speech was somewhat puzzled.17. The return to power of Laval was regarded with anxiety, particularly with regard to the disposal of the French Fleet, and there was some criticism of Allied diplomacy.18. Political tension and intrigue has returned now that anxiety aboutthe war in the Pacific is lessening. The continued strike of coal miners has beenthe principal domestic issue, and criticism of the Government for their inactionhas been widespread. The drastic new regulation making it illegal for coalminers to absent themselves, under pain of immediate call-up for militaryservice, was suspended while the Minister of Labour toured the coal-mining areas to try and persuade the miners to return. The Government have been criticised for throwing the blame on the mineowners, and there has been considerabledemand for the resignation of the Minister. His administration of the man-power regulations was severely criticised, and there is a widespread fear that war conditions are being used to further, party politics. Mr. Curtin has sinceannounced that, if the strike is not settled, action will be taken under the regulation to draft the recalcitrant strikers into the army or into essential war industries.19. The Premiers&apos; Conference has rejected the Commonwealth Govern-ment&apos;s proposal, made during April, to make the income tax burden uniform forall parts of Australia. In spite of the unified opposition of the States, it isunderstood that the Commonwealth Government intend to carry out the proposalunder a National Security Act.20.   There are signs of growing political tension, and press reports indicatethat the Government may well be facing difficulties which may lead to a crisis,fhe Government rely for their majority on two independent members, and whilepublic support is generally given to the Prime Minister, who is thought to have[23852] B 2
shown courage and decision sadly lacking in previous Administrations, there are signs that a move may be made to defeat the Government and restore Mr. Menziesto power.Naval, Military and Air Activities.21. Units of the R.A.X. were employed on escort duties off the east coast of Australia. H.M.A.S. Vampire was lost by enemy action. Three new mine-sweepers were commissioned during the month.22. Australian and Dutch troops are still maintaining guerrilla operations against the Japanese in Timor. A number of Australian Service personnel havebeen successfully evacuated from New Britain.23. Out of some 2,000 German machine guns in Australia, trophies from thelast war, 600 have already been converted to - 303 armament and are being issued to coast defence units, garrison battalions, &amp;c.24. There are at present 372,887 Australian troops serving in Australia,of which 106,839 belong to the Australian Imperial Force. There are 48,256A.I.F. serving overseas and 11,324 in transit.25. During air operations over Northern Australia, and Japanese-occupied territory north-east of Australia, 54 enemy aircraft were destroyed, 26 probably destroyed, and 44 damaged during the month. R.A.A.F. losses were 23 destroyed and 9 damaged.NEW ZEALAND.General Position.26. Attention continues to be focussed on the situation in the Pacific.Relief at the apparent lessening of the danger to Newr Zealand, and the occupa-tion of the Japanese elsewhere, has resulted in a measure of complacency, but,generally speaking, public opinion realised the importance of the situation in burma, and has never discounted the possibility of a simultaneous attack by theJapanese on India and on countries in the South-West Pacific. The air attacks on Japan and on the Philippines had an encouraging effect, but have not by any means removed the despondency wdiich is felt at the apparent naval and air superiority of Japan. Anxiety was evident at the report of the exclusion of NewZealand from the command of General MacArthur, though, in deference to service opinion, the decision will be loyally supported. It is felt, however, that australia, wdio has not conscripted her soldiers for overseas service, and who haswithdrawn her expeditionary force from abroad, has been accorded far bettertreatment, and has been reinforced, while New Zealand has been left compara-tively undefended. On the other hand, keen satisfaction was expressed at theestablishment of the Pacific War Council in Washington, which would give anopportunity for New Zealand to make her views on the war situation effectivelyknown. For this, gratitude is showm to the Commonwealth Government, and, inparticular, to Dr. Evatt, whose advocacy was thought to have been decisive.27. Much criticism of the attitude of the Australian press and Governmentcontinued, although it was admitted that Australians belated all-out war efforthad produced remarkable results. The Newr Zealand Newspaper Proprietors&apos;Association expressed its dissatisfaction with the Australian Associated press in its handling of news about United Kingdom w^ar conditions, and has decidedto strengthen its representation in Sydney in order that material may be more carefully filtered and the more obnoxious reports avoided. At the same time,comment such as &quot; What has the United Kingdom done for the Commonwealthor New Zealand ? &apos;1 occasionally appears.28. Interest in India appears to have been limited. All sections of the presscriticised the Congress party and placed the responsibility for the breakdown of negotiations on the Indians themselves.29. R.A.F. raids on Germany have been welcomed and prominently reported,but have given rise to some criticism of the policy of bombing and doubts whetherthe best use is being made of Allied air strength. The New Zealand public, too,is beginning to contrast the effectiveness, and low aircraft losses, of the Japaneseattacks on shipping, with those of the R.A.F.!
30. The possibility of opening a &quot; second front &quot; has been discussed wrclelyin New Zealand, as elsewhere, and Lord Beaverbrook&apos;s speech receivedconsiderable attention.31. The appointment of Mr. Langstone as High Commissioner for NewZealand in Canada has been unanimously deplored as inspired solely by the desire(o &quot; find a job for a discarded Minister.&quot; Much more importance is attached tothe desirability of New Zealand representation in Australia at the present time.32. The preliminary platform of the Opposition for the election, due at theend of the year, has been published. A general election is considered inevitableif the Labour party persist in rejecting a Coalition Government, and the PrimeMinister has been criticised for his failure to give a strong enough lead to theLabour party in support of a coalition.Sarah Military and Air Activities.33. Units of the Royal New Zealand Navy were engaged chiefly in escort duties in the North Tasman area covering the passage of United States convoys.Steamship Asccmia left Auckland on the .20th carrying New Zealand service personnel to Fiji.34. Commodore Sir Atwell Lake, R.N., arrived at Wellington on the10th April and assumed the duties of Chief of the Naval Staff and First NavalMember of the New Zealand Naval Board in succession to Commodore W. E.Parry as from the 1st May.35. One battalion of the Tank Brigade has now a full complement of infantry tanks and is being trained in conjunction with infantry. New engineerand bomb-disposal units are being formed.36. Voluntary enlistment of approved aliens for service overseas or in NewZealand with Army and Air Force has been approved. An AdministrativePlanning Committee, comprising Works Officers of the three Services and repre-sentatives of the United States Services, has been set up to undertakepreparations for the arrival of United States forces and to co-ordinate their requirements with those of the local Services.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.General Position.37. In the Union, as elsewhere, the progress of Sir Stafford Cripps&apos; mission to India was followed with interest, coloured by the Afrikaners comparison ofthe position of South Africa with that of India under British rule. TheTransvaaler held that the policy of the United Kingdom had been to keep botheountries dependent, and the Afrikaner Nationalist therefore concludes that hisopinion of the United Kingdom coincides with that of the Indian. TheAfrikaner may look with disfavour on Indians in South Africa, fearing as he does the intervention of the Indian Government in Union affairs, but he holds adifferent attitude regarding Indians in India, and sympathises with the Indianview of the English as a &quot; foreign element &quot; there. All pro-Government papersabsolved the United Kingdom Government from responsibility for the breakdown in the negotiations. The Opposititon press had all along described the situation as &quot;unpromising,&quot; and Die Burgher made much of the supposed difference ofopinion between the Prime Minister and Sir Stafford Cripps on the Indianquestion.38. There was renewed interest in Vichy in the early part of April, and theGovernment press recommended a &quot; ceaseless vigilance.&quot; The view was widelyheld that appeasement of Vichy had gone too far and that the time had come total her political bluff. Neither Government nor Opposition circles had anyillusions about the significance of Laval&apos;s return to power. It was generally feltthat any atttempt to draw France back into the war on the Axis side was a matterof close concern to the Union because of the possibility&apos; of hostile control ofMadagascar and Dakar. There was much comment about this time on the linesthat the Union and the United Kingdom should have ignored Vichy&apos;s assurances&apos;itid should have taken Madagascar while there was still time.   Rumours of
impending Allied action against Madagascar were, in fact, in circulation in theUnion towards the end of April. The termination of diplomatic relations with vichy was accepted by Government followers as an unhappy necessity, but onelong overdue.39. The progress of the Japanese attack has produced confusion in the mind of the general public as to the likelihood of attack on the Union of South Africa.Government speakers have made much of the Japanese menace to South Africa,while the Nationalists continue to deny its existence, although they are clearlyfeeling the embarrassments involved by such a claim. Even General Smuts hasbeen accused of inconsistency on this point, and the press has reflected the desire of the public to know whether there is or is not a Japanese menace. Publicopinion in coastal areas continues to be much perturbed at the alleged inadequacy of defences and there is a general expectation of hit-and-run raids.40. There has been some criticism of continued complacency in the Union,and dissatisfaction has been expressed at the fact that no steps are being takento put an end to the widespread hoarding being indulged in and that norationing scheme has yet been introduced. There has, however, been no sign ofany slackening in support of the continued participation of the Union in the war.The increased air attacks on Germany and German-occupied territory have beengreeted with enthusiasm and the eclipse of the Luftwaffe forecasted. Whileagitation for a &quot; second front has continued, the pro-Government press hasmaintained a cautious line, and has expressed doubts as to the possibility of a successful invasion of the Continent.41. At the annual meeting of the European Trades and Labour Council, thePresident commended the restraint of the Government in its use of emergency powers and reaffirmed the Trades Unions&apos; support for the war. The alliance withRussia was said to have removed the gap between the Labour Party and trades union on the one hand and the Communists oh the other, and a common policyin support of Russia was urged.42. Mr. Fas;an. the Nationalist Member for Stellenbosch. attracted con-siderable attention by a letter which he wrote to Die Burgher emphasising theneed for the Nationalist party to distinguish itself from the revolutionary ossewa brandwag. If the party was to be fit to form an alternative Administration, itmust desire to further the welfare of the whole people, white and coloured, andnot merely of one section. This attitude is regarded as significant of the growingrevolt against the narrow &quot; Afrikanerism &quot; expressed by the Opposition party leaders.43. In eleven by-elections for vacancies in Provincial Councils and oneParliamentary vacancy, the continued participation of the Union in the warformed the central issue. Government speakers dwelt mainly on the menace of japan, while Nationalist candidates concentrated, with some success, on arousingracial fears and passions with reference to the Government policy of arming the natives. The Nationalists retained the Parliamentary seat of Riversdale, but, ofthe 11 by-elections, 8 were won by the United Party, 2 by the Nationalists and1 by the Dominion Party. The result was a great disappointment to the nationalists, who seem to have gained little more than a handful of seceders fromthe United Party as a result of the declaration of war. The Nationalist failurein three almost wholly Afrikaans-speaking Transvaal constituencies is regardedas specially significant.Naval, Military and Air Activities.44. An Order has been issued that all officers and men of &quot; A &quot; medicalcategory and under 35 years of age who are (a) serving with Defence Headquarters,(b) serving on Command Staffs, or(c) serving on staffs of Officers Commanding troops would be transferred to a unit in the field by the 1st May, 1942. As far aspossible, posts hitherto held by &quot;A&quot; category men under 35 will be filled bymembers of the W.A.A.F. and W.A.A.S. organisations.
45. About 1,000 German prisoners, among&quot; them General von Ravenstein&apos;21st Armoured Division, and General Schmitt. have arrived in the Union;another batch of about 1,000 is expected shortly. All the prisoners will be sentto Canada as soon as shipping can be arranged. 5,000 Italian prisoners of war, atpresent in camp, are to be sent to the United Kingdom.46. Two S.A.A.F. officers have arrived in England to attend the first course at the newly organised R.A.F. Centra! Flying School. This policy is heartilywelcomed in the Union, and it is hoped that the S.A.A.F. will be allotted vacancieson subsequent courses.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.Naval, Military and Air Activities.47.   The latest strength return of the total military forces serving outsidethe borders of the Colony is as follows :  Officers. Other Ranks.Middle East       ......... S5 539East Africa        ......... 245 976West Africa       ......... 119 123United Kingdom          ...      ... 18India       ...      ......... 9 29Grand Total        ....    ... 458 1.68548. Lieutenant-General Sir William Platt, G.O.C. East African Forces,visited Defence Headquarters during February and inspected various units.EIRE.49. The supply situation is giving rise to increasing anxiety in Eire andthere is little of interest to report for the month of April apart fromannouncements of further restrictions on consumption.50. On the 7th April it was announced that owing to the impossibility of importing rubber and the need for conserving stocks of tyres, three leadingtransport firms were about to introduce severe restrictions on road transport services in Eire. It wTas announced that still more drastic reductions wouldtake place before the beginning of May.51. Mr. Lemass, the Minister for Supplies, warned the people of Eire that unless severe restrictions were observed lack of transport caused by the shortageof rubber and fuel might lead to conditions of famine in Eire. The only possiblesource of additional supplies of rubber was that which might be washed up onthe coast, and Mr. Lemass appealed to the people to report all rubber that theymight find there. He said that if the present limited stocks of rubber were usedup, motor transport would cease completely and he expected further reductions in petrol and oil imports.52. On the 5th April, Mr. Hugo Flinn, Parliamentary Secretary to the ministries of Finance and Local Government, stated that coal stocks were nearlyexhausted and that none was available for domestic consumption in any partsof Eire. Imports of coal this year would fall by many hundreds of thousands oftons and might cease altogether. All available excess turf which could be transported would be required to provide a miniimum ration of fuel for congestedborough areas.53. Restrictions in the use of paper for the production of newspapers, otherthan morning or evening newspapers, came into effect under a new EmergencyTowers Order as from the 4th May. This measure will affect directly the greatmajority of the provincial newspapers in Eire. Restrictions affecting the size ofmorning and evening papers have been in operation for &quot;several months. the cut in Eire newspapers will be 15 per cent, of the newsprint used eight months before the outbreak of war.   The Order also prohibits the publication without
authority of any newspaper or periodical not in publication during 1940 or thepublication of any newspaper or periodical at more frequent intervals thanthose at which it was published during 1940.54. Speaking in the Dail at the end of April during a debate on the central bank Bill. Mr. de Valera said that the methods used by other Central Bankswould not be effective in this case, the difficulty being the volume of sterling-assets in liquid form immediately available to be turned into cash. &quot; It was wrong.&quot; he said, &quot; to say that they were handing over their sovereignty. Therewas nothing in the Bill which would deprive Parliament of the power to deal withthe banks. That was always in reserve, but the exercise-bf the power affectingreserves of credit was largely a matter for experts and the power could not beleft in the hands of a Minister without check.&quot;INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political Situation.55. The proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the closer associationof Indians in the conduct of the Government of India during the war and forthe revision of the Indian constitution after the war were made public on the30th March. The discussions with the Indian leaders were prolonged by sir stafford Cripps for another fortnight, in connection with the problem of defence.At one time it seemed as if agreement with Congress could be reached on a divisionof responsibilities between the Commander-in-Chief and an - Indian DefenceMember; but the negotiations broke down when it transpired that, notwith-standing His Majesty&apos;s Governments promise that no major constitutional change was possible during the war, Congress would be satisfied with nothing-less than a fully powered &quot;National Government,&quot; responsible only to itself.56. The breakdown was in appearance and in fact with Congress : but when it was known that Congress would not accept His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsscheme the Moslem League announced their rejection of the proposals, ostensiblyon the ground their interests were not adequately met by the post-warprovisions. Other parties the Hindu Mahasabha, the Sikhs, the depressed classes had already pronounced the proposals unacceptable as being detrimental to their particular interests. To some of the Princes at least the failure of thenegotiations came as a relief. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that, althoughthe mission of Sir Stafford Cripps did not achieve its immediate purpose, it hasprepared the ground for future agreement between the conflicting elements inIndia and by demonstrating the sincerity of His Majesty&apos;s governments intentions has improved relations between India and Great Britain.57. During the rest of the month party leaders made various pronouncementswhich, Avhile critical of His Majesty&apos;s Government and disclaiming any intentionto co-operate, nevertheless reaffirmed antagonism to Nazism and Fascism. Theonly political development of note, however, was the defection from the All-india congress Committee at the end of April of one of its prominent leaders,Mr. C. Rajagopalachariar, former Congress Prime Minister of ^Madras, who refused to submit to the condemnation by the All India Congress of his action insponsoring resolutions passed by the Madras Legislature Congress Partyadvocating, in the interest of joint action in face of the common danger,recognition of the Moslem League claim for separation, if ultimately persisted in, and association with the League in a popular Government. It is not yetclear whether Mr. Raj agopalachariar is prepared and able again to form aMinistry in Madras.58. The Indian coast-line had its first enemy visitation on the 6th April,when the ports of Vizagapatam and Cocanada were bombed by Japanese aircraft operating from a powerful naval force which inflicted considerable damage on shipping in the Bay of Bengal. Extensive evacuation of the.non-essential panof the population from Calcutta and Madras has been encouraged and assisted by Government.   A false alarm that Madras was immediately threatened with
invasion led the authorities in the middle of April to carry out an extensivedislocation of the harbour and railway facilities in the city; but normal services are being quickly restored, and the essential portions of the Secretariat have beenbrought back. Morale generally is not too satisfactory: the imminence of dangerhas caused widespread anxiety for the safety of person and property, butco-operation with Governments preparations to resist the aggressor has been disappointing. The Viceroy and Provincial Governors are doing their best tosteady morale and encourage resistance to the enemy by vigorous promotion of aNational War Front.Indian States.59. Deterioration in morale and the circulation of false and mischievousrumours are reported in the States as well as in British India but are being actively resisted by the authorities. Satisfactory contributions have been madeby the States in manpower for the Assam Road. Cochin alone producing 10.000men.Foreign and Frontier Relations.60. (a) Afghanistan. There was little to report from Afghanistan during april. The Afghan Government have now agreed to exchange MinistersPlenipotentiary with the United States of America. Allied stock was reportedto have gone down considerably during the last weeks partly owing to Japanesesuccesses and partly to doubts as to Russia&apos;s capacity to withstand the expectedSpring offensive. Reaction to the failure of constitutional discussions in india was one of sharp criticism of Great Britain inspired partly by the feeling thatif the Indian people were behind the Indian army there would be more chanceof the Japanese advance being halted far from the borders of Afghanistan. Alack of rain during the last few weeks may have an adverse effect on crops.(b) North-West Frontier. In Waziristan symptoms of tribal unrest werediscernible in numerous minor incidents; though in Mahsud territory theGovernor, touring solely under tribal protection, interviewed a Mahsud Jirga and found their attitude one of unprecedented friendliness. An Afridi Jirga alsopresented the Governor with 5,000 rupees for the War Purposes Fund.In Madda Khel country air action had to be taken against the village ofthe leading hostile Malik, and near Jandola the scouts, with co-operation fromthe air, dispersed a hostile Lashkar led by the Din Faqir. the principal instigatorof opposition to the defence works. These offensive actions by Government had achastening effect and it is reported that several hostile leaders were killed. TheFaqir of Ipi persisted in attempts to fine Wazirs engaged at defence works andthreatened contractors with religious sanctions.A serious raid occurred in the Dera Ismail Khan district which resulted inthe looting of three lorries, the kidnapping of three persons and the murder of aconstable.   Another raid was repulsed by the Frontier Constabulary.Following upon the negotiations with Sir Stafford Cripps influences were at work to interest tribesmen in the Pakistan ideal and to arouse apprehensionat the possible transfer of power from British to non-Muslim hands.(c) The United, States of America, and China. Colonel Johnson, the presidents personal representative in India, arrived at Delhi on the 3rd april and presented the Presidents letter of introduction to the Viceroy. The Chineserepresentative, Mr. Shen Shih-hua, reached Delhi a week later.(d) The Persian Gulf. Early in the month the Sheikh of Koweitwasreportedto be dangerously ill with thrombosis. A later report, however, showed that his health had since much improved. In Bahrain arrangements are being examined by the Bahrain Petroleum Company to block a number of their wells in such a manner as to prevent hostile forces in temporary occupation from making use ofthem or destroying for ever the resources of the oilfield. The programme contem-plated will not seriously affect production. Steps are being taken by the political resident to issue a regulation requiring employees of the Oil Companies (otherthan Americans) operating in Bahrain and Koweit to remain-at their occupation.Economic and Finance.61.   Nothing to report.. [23852] c
Naval. Military and Air Force Activities.62. The Sloop Indus was bombed and sunk by enemy action in the Bay of bengal.63. Large shipments of engineer and other stores continue to be made from india to theatres overseas. In December 1941 55.265 tons of engineer stores were despatched.64. An intensive programme of aerodrome construction is being carriedout work is proceeding on a 24-hour basis.65. No major troop movements have taken place since those detailed in the march report.66. In view of the new problems affecting defence on both the East and Westfrontiers, internal security, civil defence, &amp;c., it has been agreed that the Armyin India should be reorganised into three operational commands and a centralcommand which will relieve operational commands of a large internal securityarea and a considerable block of administration and training.67. The expansion of the Indian Army has called for a large increase inthe number of officers. It was estimated in November 1941 that up to the end of1942 the requirement would be approximately 12.000. Half of this number willbe supplied from officers commissioned in the United Kingdom and it is theintention to train the balance at Officers&quot; Training Schools in India. There arenow four of these schools : Capacity.Cadets.Bangalore...............      1,200Mhow..................        800Indian Military Academy, Dehra Dun    ... 600Belgaum        &quot;.....&apos;    .........        200At these schools British and Indian cadets are trained together. The majorityof the British cadets are selected and sent out by the War Office from units in theUnited Kingdom.68. In addition up to 230 Indian States Forces cadets are trained yearly atthe first three of the above schools for commissions in Indian States Forces.69. After basic training at these schools cadets for the Indian ArmouredCorps and R.I.A.S.C. undergo specialist training at the Fighting Vehicle School,Ahmednagar. and the R.I.A.S.C. School, Cbaklala. Cadets for Indian Artilleryare trained throughout at the School of Artillery (India) Cadet Wing, Deolali.and cadets for Indian Engineers at Bangalore. Roorkee and Kirkee. the HQ.of the three corps of Sappers and Miners.70. By February 1942. when 2.165 officers were under training, in India, atotal of 6.245 officers had been commissioned in India since the outbreak of war.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Military.71. During April our forces in Burma were forced to continue their withdrawal northwards. The Japanese advance, which up to the present had followed the course of the Sittang and Irrawaddy rivers, developed during thelatter half of the month into a triple drive. The object of the latest drive throughthe Shan States via Loilem, was evidently to cut the Burma Road at Lashio, andin this the Japanese have been successful.72. On the Sittang and Irrawaddy fronts severe fighting took place andthe enemy advance was stubbornly contested. The oilfields at Yenangyaung weresuccessfullv destroyed before evacuation.
73. By the 30th April the Japanese had reached the line running approxi-mately north of Kyauk Padang and Pyawbe, and the fighting on these frontsthen developed into a battle for Mandalay.Internal.74. The Governor and the remaining Ministers stayed at Maymyo until about the 25th April, when the Governor moved to Myitkyina and the Premierand another Minister flew to India. The other Ministers had departed into the jungle before this.75. During April there wras little or no improvement in the internal situation.   Communications of all kinds were seriously disorganised.76. A policy was adopted of bringing administration progressively undermilitary control and of proclaiming martial law in war areas. By the 21st april the operation of all the principal services had come under military control, andall civilian officers in the area between the front line and Shwrebo were placed under General Alexanders orders.77. The evacuation of Indian and other refugees remained one of theadministration^ most acute problems. At one time some 75,000 were concentrated in camps round Mandalay awaiting an opportunity to leave by road or by air.i hough the few aircraft available were being- used mainly for wounded.External.78. From the 6th to 9th April General and Madame Chiang Kai-shekvisited the Governor and inspected Mandalay, which had been heavily bombed onthe 3rd April. The meeting was friendly, but their dissatisfaction at the lack ofair support was evident.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &apos;&apos; Colonial Governors &apos;&apos; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)(i) Economic Affairs.The Anglo-United States Caribbean Commission.79. The Anglo-United States Caribbean Commission met in Trinidadduring the course of the month. The British members were Sir Frank Stockdale,the Comptroller for Development and &quot;Welfare in the West Indies, Sir RupertBriercliffe, his Medical Adviser, and Mr. Caine, Head of the Economic Depart-ment of the Colonial Office. From the reports which have so far been receivedit appears that the Conference devoted itself entirely to the question of food supplies for the Caribbean area. It recommended that stocks should be kept upto a three months&apos; level, as opposed to the 40 days&apos; level, which is the War Officedesideratum for the area. An attempt has been made to secure the necessary food-stuffs to build up stocks accordingly under Lease-Lend, but the case has been declared ineligible by Olla. It is hoped that this decision may be reversed later on. but in the meantime it is expected that it will be necessary, with Treasuryeonsent, to make cash purchases amounting to $H million on behalf of Jamaica,Trinidad and British Guiana alone.Sh shipping Difficulties.80. On account of shipping difficulties the position regarding the transportof goods from this country to certain parts of the Colonial Empire, notably Ceylon,East Africa and West Africa, is becoming more serious. Preliminary considera-tion is about to be given, in consultation with the East African Governments,to the possibility of instituting a shipping programme for East Africa, some-what on the lines of that administered for Middle East territories through theMiddle East Supply Centre.[23852] d
Rubber Tyres.81. During the month under review, amongst goods in short supply nonelias been so much in evidence as tyres. The shortage of these both in the UnitedKingdom and in the United States is, of course, fully appreciated in the ColonialOffice, but it is hoped that it will be possible to allocate sufficient supplies to meetthe essential needs of the Colonial Empire, especially West Africa.West African Railway Requirements.82. Urgent consideration is being given to the question of meeting thedemands for additional locomotives and rolling stock for the Nigerian, Gold coast and Sierra Leone railways. These demands arise in part from military needs and in part from the greatly increased exports of raw materials which it is hoped to secure from the West African Colonies. So far as is possible standardspecifications will be adopted, and it is hoped to secure the bulk of the require-ments from the United States under Lease-Lend.Labour.83. The Colonial Labour Advisory Committee has now been formed.Chairman, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (ex officio). Membersinclude the Deputy Under-Secretary of State, my Labour Adviser, the officer inthe Social Services Department responsible for labour questions, Sir FrederickLeggett (Chief Industrial Commissioner, Ministry of Labour), Sir John ForbesWatson (Director. British Employers&quot; Confederation and a member of theGoverning Body of the International Labour Office), Mr. Joseph Hallsworth (amember of the Trades Union Congress General Council, and of the Governing-Body of the International Labour Office), Mr. Cecil W. Murray, who has hadwide experience of employment in the West Indies and who was suggested-by theBritish Employers&apos; Confederation, and Mr. Arthur Dalgleish, a prominent tradeunionist suggested by the Trades Union Congress, who was a member of the Corn-mission which investigated the 1940 Northern Rhodesia Copper Belt disturbances.84. Sir F. Leggett. Sir J. Forbes Watson and Mr. Ffallsworth have for manyyears been respectively the British Government. Employers&apos;and Workers&apos; delegates at the International Labour Conferences, and attended the recent InternationalLabour Conference in New- York in those capacities.Colonial Development and Social Services.85. In paragraph 8 of the statement of policy on Colonial Development and welfare (Cmd. 6175), issued in February 1940, it was stated that it was-proposedto set up a Colonial Research Advisory Committee whose functions would includeadvising on the allocation of the sum of  500,000 a year, for which provision has since been made by the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1940, for thepurposes of Colonial research. In May 1941, owing to the turn then taken in thewar situation, it was decided to defer the setting up of this Committee. various proposals in the field of Colonial research are, however, now being put forward,and I am satisfied that they ought to be considered without undue delay. I have,therefore, decided now to set up the Advisory Committee contemplated in 1940.and Lord Hailey has agreed to act as chairman. I propose, for the present, to start with a small committee, which can be expanded later on whencircumstances permit.(ii) Defence.Manpower.86. G.H.Q., Middle East, have informed the War Office that they are inurgent need of 130,000 additional men for service in non-fighting capacities,e.g., on garrison and pioneer duties and in skilled trades, such as motor driving.Various Colonial Governments have been asked what contributions they can maketowards raising this total, having regard to local military and production requirements, if necessary by extending existing conscription measures. Replies so farreceived indicate that the African territories, and particularly Nigeria and theGold Coast, may be able to make an appreciable contribution, given the necessaryrecruiting and training facilities. The whole question is to be discussed withthe Deputy Adjutant-General, Middle East, who is returning to this country.
West A frica.96. The construction of a deep-water quay at Freetown, on a site recentlyselected by the Consulting Engineer to the Colonial Government, is to beundertaken by the American authorities as part of a Naval &quot; task.&quot; Thequestion of constructing a deep-water quay at Bathurst in the Gambia is alsounder examination.97. The congestion of shipping in the harbour at Freetown, due to the inability of shore facilities to cope with the greatly increased volume of traffic,is engaging the very serious attention of authorities in this country and inthe Colony.*Civil Defence.87. Most Colonial Governments have been asked to submit, as from the1st May, monthly progress reports on civil defence measures. These reports willbe examined in consultation with the Inspector-General of the Ministry of home security in this country. A number of additional experienced A.R.P. officers have been selected for appointment in certain Colonies.Reports on Individual Colonies.Palestine.88. There has been no Arab political activity of importance during the past month. Dissension in the Jewish community is more pronounced than usual andthe Agency has been increasingly criticised by moderate and responsible Jews, bythe German-Jewish community and by Jewish Communists for indulging in party politics to the detriment of legitimate Jewish interests and the war effort.89. On the question of Jewish defence, the Agency, while not giving up thehope that a Jewish army will subsequently be conceded, is concentrating inPalestine on measures to achieve the maximum results within the existing frame-work of enlistment in the Palestine Buffs and the police.90. The Governments further measures to ensure supplies and reduce thecost of living are sustained by all communities. The decision that there shouldbe Government monopoly of the purchase of the coming cereal crop, surplus to theneeds of cultivators, is recognised as being in the public interest, and there hasbeen less criticism than might have been expected.91. The practice of bands of Jewish youths wandering through remoteArab areas either on walking expeditions or for illegal military training is givinggrounds for concern to the authorities. One of these expeditions was the occasion for an accident which caused the death and injury of a considerable number ofthe participants. On the 22nd April attempts were made in Jerusalem toassassinate the Inspector-General of Police and one of the two assistant inspector-generals by means of bombs. There is strong presumption that these attemptswere the work of the Stern Group in revenge for successful police action taken against this band of Jewish terrorists.92. The recent visit to Amman by General Auchinleck gave great pleasureto the Amir. The King of the Hellenes also visited His Highness. The PrimeMinister of Transjordan recently paid an informal visit to Egypt, in the courseof which he conveyed the Amir&apos;s personal greetings to Nahas Pasha.Ceylon.93. The labour situation shows improvement. Broadcast appeals by theCommander-in-Chief and the Governor to workers not to desert their posts andan announcement that absentees will be summarily dismissed has had a satis-factory effect,94. Movement of Indians to India continues, but the institution of an exitpermit system for essential workers is being urgently discussed with Governmentof India.95.   Recruitment for essential services and labour battalions is proceeding
98. The labour situation in Freetown is serious owing to the almost complete lack of discipline among locally recruited labour. A system of registration of labour has been approved and will be introduced shortly togetherwith an amendment of the Essential Works Order which will make it moredifficult for labour to drift from one job to another.East Africa.99. An important step has been taken in East Africa to ensure that co-ordinated action can be taken in case of emergency. The Governor of Kenya,in his capacity as Chairman of the East African Governors&apos; Conference, has hadconferred upon him the power to give directions to the Governors of Uganda and tanganyka and the British Resident, Zanzibar, in all cases in which, uponrepresentation made to the Chairman by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, urgent military necessity requires such directions to be given, and in all matters affecting the common interests of East Africa in the prosecution of thewar where reasons of special urgency render immediate action imperative.100. The Chairman has also been empowered to give directions similarlyto the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyrasaland in matters of communi-cations (other than railways) and movement of tihe civil populations within east african territories in the event of military necessity on representations by theGeneral Officer Cominanding-in-Chief requiring such directions to be given. Thearrangement is a temporary one to meet the present emergency and, unlessprecluded by urgency, the directions given by the Chairman in exercise of these powers will be based upon prior consultation with the Governors concerned orthe British Resident. When the Chairman deems it necessary to override theviews of Governors or the British Resident, they will have the right to appealto the Secretary of State, but on all urgent matters they will first have to complywith the Chairman&apos;s instructions.101. Special defence areas are being declared in the coastal districts of kenya and Tanganyika in whidh certain powers under Defence Regulationsnormally exercised by the Governors are being delegated to the General OfficerCommand ing-in-Chief.102. A Kenya and Uganda Civil Defence and Supply Council has beenformed, whose primary object is to provide for the consideration and co-ordinationof civil defence, supply and production problems by an authoritative body repre-sentative of the departmental activities concerned and therefore competent totake decisions. The Chairman is the Governor of Kenya, and the members, whoinclude both officials and unofficials, have each been assigned a special sphere ofwork. Each member has been seleeted for his personal suitability or previous experience of the duties with which he has been entrusted, and not on the basisof any sectional or racial representation. No constitutional change is involved.Care has been taken to safeguard the interests of Africans, in the sphere in whichthey are most affected, by the appointment of the Attorney-General as Directorof Civil Emergency^ Services and Man-Power. This officer has in turn set up aCommittee to advise him, of which the Chief Native Commissioner is a Member103. The Government of Uganda has two representatives on the Council,which also includes a Military and an Air Force representative. The chief secretary to the East African Governors&apos; Conference attends meetings of theCouncil to ensure co-ordination with the other East African Territories wheneversubjects affecting them arise.
