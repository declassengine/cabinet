S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1942.EGRET. Copy No..p. (R) (42) 22.april 25. 1942.YJAB. CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH 1942 FOR THE DOMINIONS.INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.(1) General Position.PUBLIC attention throughout March was focussed mainly on India, theUnited Kingdom, and local domestic policy, rather than on events in the Pacific.The progress of the negotiations between Sir Stafford Cripps and thevarious parties in India was closely followed, and the differences of opinionwithin India were acknowledged. Early widespread demands in the Canadianpress for freedom, liberty, and independence for India gave way, as time wenton, to a realisation of the many complexities of the situation. Sir stafford cripps was regarded as an admirable choice, and there was great faith in his power to effect a settlement. The general feeling was that, although the UnitedKingdom Governments proposals might fall short of full independence incertain respects, the right course for India was clearly to accept the proposals.Mildly sensational press comment on the likelihood of Sir Stafford Crippsbecoming Prime Minister of the United Kingdom produced the inevitablereaction, and complete faith in the continued leadership of the present PrimeMinister was announced.The sympathy and concern expressed by Canada for the dangerous positionin which Australia had been placed by the Japanese aggression gave place toresentment at criticisms made in the Commonwealth that she was not receivingenough Canadian war material. Australian affairs figured prominently in thelews with the announcement of General MacArthur&apos;s appointment, which was&quot;reefed by the Canadian press generally with enthusiasm. In this connexion,one newspaper commented: &quot; It would be reasonable to suggest that the Caseyaffair and the MacArthur appointment are but external manifestations ofhanging circumstances which will take Australia out of Britain&apos;s sphere ofnfluence, and within the orbit of America.&quot;The press also defended the United Kingdom Government war policyigainst criticisms made in the United States, and the speeches by Mr. Attlee,and by Lord Halifax on United Kingdom war production, received wide publicity. Great interest was shown in Canada over the further restrictions and sacrifices which are being imposed on the people of the United Kingdom,and they were recognised as being very much more severe than anything yetxperienced by Canadians.[23736] B
Although the bombing of the Paris factories produced a disagreeableimpression among French-Canadians, the general feeling, expressed even inthe French press, was that Paris must now be considered German territory, andthat the United Kingdom Government had acted rightly.The &quot;Dominion Plebiscite Act, 1942.&quot;&apos; was passed after a comparatively short debate. The Governments policy in seeking, by means of a plebiscite,the release from its.pledges on the subject of conscription for service overseas,has been criticised as weak, and a waste of public time and money. The mainopposition to action under the Act is centred in Quebec, where a vociferouscampaign has been organised against the possible introduction of conscription.The opening of this campaign in Montreal by M. Bourassa resulted indemonstrations, some street fighting, and damage to property, but there was nophysica I violence.Polling day for the plebiscite has been fixed for the 27th April, and thequestion on which the public will be asked to vote takes the form : &quot;Are you in favour of releasing the Government from any obligationarising out of any past commitments restricting the methods of raisingmen for military service?Mr. de Valera&apos;s continued harping on the partition of Ireland led to ascathing editorial, in connexion with his St. Patrick&apos;s Day broadcast, by the montreal Star, under the heading &quot; How De Valera Helps Hitler.&quot;Continued demands for the opening up of a second front have appeared.&quot; It is a good sign that there is an increasing manifestation of an offensivespirit in the United Nations.&quot; In this connexion, however, Genera!MacNaughton&apos;s warning against premature action had a salutary effect.Universal horror was expressed over Mr. Eden&apos;s revelations of Japaneseatrocities at Hong Kong, where many Canadians were prisoners.The Canadian public has become disillusioned over the prospect of furtherco-operation with Vichy, and it is evident from the tone of the press commentthat an eventual break with Vichy is thought to be almost inevitable.(2) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Lieiitcnant-General A. G. L. MacNaughton returned to the United Kingdomafter a brief visit to Canada.Canadian Corps Headquarters were visited by Commander-in-Chief,Home Forces, on the 14th March.There are now 7.370 officers and 118.198 other ranks serving in the UnitedKingdom.No. 402 (Fighter) Squadron, after changing over from Hurricanes toSpitfires, again became operational towards the latter part of the month.No. 409 (Night Fighter) Squadron shot down one enemy aircraft. Nos. 405.408 and 419 (Bomber) Squadrons all took part in the attack on the Renaultworks ami also carried out raids on North-West Germany. Nos. 405 and 419each went to Essen four times. No. 407 Squadron, which has been especiallysuccessful in attacking enemy shipping, spent the month mainly in training and reorganisation. No. 413 (Catalina) Squadron has left for the indian ocean area.   No. 420 Squadron carried out several sea-mining operations.(3) Economic Activities.The War Appropriation (United Kingdom Financing) Act, implementing the &quot; Billion Dollar gift,&quot; was passed this month.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.(4) General Position.Public opinion in the Commonwealth during the month has passed throughmany phases. At the beginning of March there was some deterioration in morale,caused by the growing despondency over continuing Allied disasters in the Pacific,and by the feeling that, as soon as Java was under control, Australia would beinvaded.   These shocks, coupled with the lack of visible aid from the United
Kingdom, and the comments of returning war correspondents and refugees from malaya, brought about a sharp renewal of criticism of the United Kingdom(government, and at the same time a gradual turning towards the United states-,,,. the material aid so clearly essential for the defence of Australia.The Press devoted considerable space to an attempt to build up public confidence, but the first signs of real improvement came with the very successfulR A.A.F. raids on Japanese bases in New Guinea. Mr. CurthVs broadcast and,later, the announcement of his telegraphic appeal to President Roosevelt, coupledwitli the arrival of a Lease-Lend Mission, made it clear that a growing volume of help from the United States might be expected.The announcement of the presence of United States troops in the Common-wealth had an electrical effect on the public, and for several days the Pressfeatured this news to the exclusion of all else. General Mac Arthur&apos;s subsequentarrival and his appointment heightened public confidence, and a deep sense of grattitude to the United States was felt. The return of the A.I.F. completed this change in public opinion, and the despondency which had led to bitter criticism of the United Kingdom also vanished. Press articles paying a generous tribute to the long stand which the United Kingdom had made alone, and giving an assurance that, although the Commonwealth had turned to the United States for help, there was no lessening of the ties and affection felt for the Mother country,appeared. In this connexion, although the conduct of the Australian troops in malaya had provided almost the sole bright spot in an otherwise dark picture,the widely quoted despatch from the Singapore correspondent of the Times was criticised&quot;in Australia as being based on &quot;necessarily hasty observations,&quot; andthe correspondent5s remark that Australia felt that it was at America&apos;s siderather than at BritaiiCs that she was now fighting, drew the acid comment: &quot; Itis remarkable that such an influential newspaper should publish such hastyconclusions and false impressions.&quot;Criticism of the United Kingdom was. however, renewed with the controversyover the appointment of Mr. Casey as Minister of State, though not-to any largeextent. The telegrams concerning the appointment were published in full, andevoked considerable feeling for a short time. The controversy was, however,generally deplored, though surprise was expressed that the proposal should havebeen pursued in the face of the obvious unwillingness of the commonwealth government to release Mr. Casey. References were made to the &quot; untimelytransfer,&quot; and the general feeling was that the offer should not have been madeto Mr. Casey and that he should not have accepted it. It was strongly emphasised in some sections of the Press that Mr. Casey could not be regarded as in any wayrepresenting Australian interests in his new post.Mr. Evatts&apos; mission to Washington was followed with interest, and the setting up of a Pacific Council in Washington was regarded as the first resultof the mission.In this connexion the Commonwealth Prime Minister said on the 31st March :&quot; The fact that Australia would now have a direct voice m the higher directionof the war in the Pacific, was a deep source of satisfaction.&quot;Impatience has continued to be expressed at the lack of action on the partof the Commonwealth Government. The administrative machinery has been working badly, and the delays and congestion were contrasted with&quot; the speedyeffectiveness of Japanese methods. The continuance of labour disputes,particularly in the coalfields, and the peacetime habits of the Service and otherDepartments, led to a demand for more vigorous compulsory methods rather than&quot; appeals &quot; by the Government,The Australian Press took a realistic line over the United Kingdom Govern-menCs proposals to India, which were commented on as being &quot; on liberal, evenmagnanimous lines,&quot; by remarking that &quot; this was not the moment to attempt a constitutional revolution.&quot;The Roman Catholic press showed embarrassment at the appointment of a japanese Envoy to the Vatican, and was hard put to it to defend the appointmentat the present time.Commenting on Mr. Edeifs disclosure of Japanese atrocities, the SydneyMorning Herald said that &quot;the disclosure will&apos;galvanise the United Nationswithin inflexible will.&quot;Throughout Australia&apos;, all men between the ages of 45 and 60 must nowregister for compulsory military training.[23736] &apos; b 2
(5) Naval, Military and Air Activities.II.M.A.S. Perth and H.M.A. sloop Yarra were presumed lost in East Indieswaters at the beginning of the month.H.M.A.S. Adelaide, Hobart and Westralia were employed on escort duties with the Anzac Squadron. H.M.A.S. Manoora arrived at Melbourne fromColombo to join the Anzac Squadron.Strength of the Royal Australian Navy on the 28th February was : On active service    ...       ...       ...      ...        7,821Reserves       ................      13,190Total ............      21,011General MacArthur lias supreme command of all sea. land and air forces inhis area of responsibility, which includes the whole of Australia.General Sir Thomas A. Blarney returned from Middle East and hasbeen appointed Commander-in-ChieL Allied Land Forces in Australia. his command comprises First Army (Lieutenant-General Lavarack) coveringNorthern and Eastern Commands;&apos; Second Army (Lieutenant-General Mackay)covering Southern Command; Western Command (Lieutenant-General GordonBennett): Northern Territory (Major-General Herring); New Guinea (Major-General Morris),The name Army Headquarters disappears and is changed to General Head-quarters. The Military Board has disappeared and its collective responsibilityis now vested in the Commander-in-Chief. Lieutenant-General Wynter has beenappointed General-in-Charge of administration. Lieutenant-General Sturdeeremains Chief of the General Staff and represents the Commander-in-Chief atthe War Cabinet and Advisory War Council.The 7th.Division and 6th Division (less two brigade groups in Ceylon) areequipped and trained and have war experience. In addition, five infantry divisions are reasonably well equipped as regards artillery and automatic w-weapons,but are about 25 per cent, deficient in M/T. Training of the remaining two infantry divisions is hampered by shortage of equipment.The Armoured Division can only operate at present on a carrier basis. Tanksare beginning to arrive and it is hoped that 1st Armoured Brigade may be readyto operate with tanks by May.Apart from returned A.I.F. units, the Field Army has no heavy or lightanti-aircraft regiments, but they are being formed as equipment becomes available.The principal United States Army units in Australia on the 28th. march were: Headquarters Supreme Command, South-West Pacific; HeadquartersUnited States Army Forces in Australia; two Anti-Aircraft Regiments; twoAnti-Aircraft Brigades; two Field Army Regiments, less one battery; twoEngineer Regiments; one Engineer Battalion. A United States Division is beginning to arrive.Up to the present, 43,8S6 troops, 5.360 vehicles. 144 guns and 25,532 tons of equipment and stores have returned from the Middle East.On Western front. No. 455 (Bomber) Squadron took part regularly in night-bombing operations over enemy territory. No. 460 (Bomber) Squadron, whichhas only recently become operational, also participated. Nos. 456 (Night Fighter)Squadron and 457 (Spitfire) are also operational squadrons.In South-West Pacific Area several enemy air raids took place on Darwin,Broome and Wyndham. R.A.A.F. aircraft, together with United StatesFortresses, carried out many attacks on Japanese bases in Timor, New- Guineaand New Britain.NEW ZEALAND.(6) General Position.The naval losses in the battle of Java were a severe blow for which theNew Zealand public was entirely unprepared. The nap id&apos; deterioration in thesituation in the Pacific was interpreted as a growing threat to New Zealand, andthe Government based its plans on the assumption that the &quot; Anzac &quot; countries
would be attacked next. There was considerable criticism of the handling of(he Malayan situation, and the critical articles of Australian correspondentswere featured. Considerable enthusiasm was expressed at the news ofGeneral MacArthur&apos;s appointment, and the press generally made much of the strong United States convoys reported to be. on their way to the Soudi-west pacific. The Royal Australian Air Force&apos;s vigorous action in the bombing of japanese bases in New Guinea likewise gave encouragement and increased public confidence. . ,Towards the end of March, when Japanese progress southwards seemed tobe halted, New Zealand eyes turned towards Burma, India and events in Europe,and it was appreciated that, after all, the next Japanese move might not be inthe direction of New Zealand. Hope was expressed that India would accept theUnited Kingdom Governments constitutional proposals, which were well received in New Zealand as being, for all practical purposes, an offer of full political independence.Interest in the Russian successes continued. M. Maisky&apos;s statement on thenecessity for a supreme effort in 1942 was given prominence, and evoked renewedinterest in the possibilitiy of opening a second front this year.Reports featured in the New Zealand press of slackness, luxury andinefficiency in the United Kingdom have produced a widespread and mischievouseffect on public opinion in New Zealand. As one result, a press censorship (whichwill cover articles from the United Kingdom) has now been introduced in orderto check irresponsible criticism and misrepresentation.Labour unrest, typified by the strike and subsequent imprisonment sentenceon 300 freezing workers, is causing much concern and, in a confidential talk withthe United Kingdom High Commissioner, the Prime Minister announced that,if he is not assured of full support for his policy by the Industrial Labour Party,lie will resign.(7) Naval, Military and Air Activities.The Anzac Squadron was operating in the North Tasman area. The cruisersAchilles and Leander were engaged mainly on escort duties covering UnitedStates convoys; the armed merchant cruiser Monowai also carried out escort andconvoy duties.Work is proceeding steadily at Port Chalmers and Wellington onconstruction of steel mine-sweepers.Reinforcements totalling 1,027 all ranks reached Fiji during March,completing the proposed extension of the Fiji force, which is now officially knownas &quot; Pacific Section of 2nd N.Z.E.F.&quot;Women aged 20-21 and men aged 46-50 have been required to register andmay be drafted to essential wTork. Naturalised British subjects are required toenrol for military service. Medical examination and drafting of 17,570 men called up on the 25th March is proceeding. Authority is being taken to makeservice in the Home Guard compulsory.No. 75 (New Zealand) Squadron, R.A.F.. took part regularly in night-bombing operations over Germany and German-occupied territory.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.(8) General Position.During March there was a steadily increasing realisation that the war is nolonger a matter of academic interest for the Union. The danger from Japanhas become the dominant political issue, and the series of Allied reverses duringthe month led to bitter Opposition attacks on the United Kingdom Governmentand on the Union Government as their henchmen.The debates on the Budget and, more particularly, on.the Prime Ministersvote in Committee of Supply, reflect a deplorable further deterioration in thespirit of the Opposition as shown in the House of Assembly. The Prime Minister,with much self-control,.nevertheless showed great anger at the Opposition tacticsof placing obstacles in the way of the Government carrying out its duties at thismost critical time.   The United Kingdom High Commissioner considers that
much of ilie bitter opposition is probably due to an uneasy conscience over their refusal to join in the defence of South Africa, the psychological way out beingfor the Opposition to attack Britain for &quot; letting the Allies down.&quot; The growingJapanese menace thus produced a confused political picture, and refusal toco-operate in the war effort, coupled with a realisation of the present danger tothe Union, has. in fact, put the anti-war Opposition into an untenable position.Dr. Milan, the leader of the Nationalist Party, advocated once again that theUnion should withdraw from the war and devote her efforts to the defence ofhei own borders. If the Japanese menace is so great, he asked, why has notGeneral Smuts withdrawn Union troops from North Africa? Opposition attack?on the Budget were coupled with gibes at the lack of defences in the Union,despite the vast expenditure set out in the war budgets.General Smuts defended the United Kingdom Government on the wide-spread and well-worn charge of having left her Allies in the lurch, and, in replyto questions regarding the Union Governments policy on Madagascar, statedthat they were on friendly terms with the Vichy Government and that there wasno intention of making any change in respect of Madagascar so long as it didnot become a danger to South Africa.The Prime Ministers statement that, if necessary for defence, he would armthe natives in order to stem any Japanese attack, aroused considerable feeling,and has increased the embarrassment of the Nationalist Party. Such a policy isregarded by many in South Africa as suicide for the wdiite race, and there isa growing feeling (largely unexpressed as yet) among Nationalists that somehelp for the war may have to be forthcoming from them to avoid calling uponthe natives for aid.The divisions between the various factions which go to make up theOpposition have become even wider, but the Opposition continues to place even-possible obstacle in the way of the Union Government. Mr. Pirow and Dr. vanRensburg, the leaders respectively of the New Order and Ossewa Brandwaggroups, have declared openly that they are staking all on a German victory, andare shaping their policy on the assumption that their hopes will be realised.General Hertzog&apos;s appeal for Afrikaner unity produced an inconclusive state-ment of policy at the subsequent meeting of the Afrikaner Party. While adhering to its former attitude to the war. it states that &quot;it is not blind to internationaldevelopments, and will always adapt itself to what is in the interest of SouthAfrica.&quot;For the Herenigde Party, the largest of the Opposition groups, Dr. Malanfound occasion to comment on Sir Stafford Cripps&apos;s position in the UnitedKingdom as the *&apos; beginning of Bolshevism.&quot; Pro-Government papers, for their part, welcomed the announcement of the Mission to India as proof that a great&quot; liberal experiment &quot; is to be made. The granting of anything like dominion status to India w^ould mean the recasting of die South African attitude to India,and the time is thought to be ripe for giving to the Indians in South Africa some form of political representation.There is a general expectation that the end of the present session will see cabinet changes in the Union. Pressure is being put on the Prime Minister to choose parliamentary secretaries from among the younger members of Parlia-rnent. The Minister for Commerce and Industries and the Minister for agriculture are expected to resign on grounds of ill-health or age, and. althoughnames such as that of Mr. Colin Steyn are being spoken of as possible PrimeMinisters, there is a clear belief that General Smuts must remain Prime Ministerfor the duration of the war.(9) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Tt has been decided that all anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft searchlightsallotted to the defended ports will in future come under the direct control of.and be manned by, the S.A.A.F. &apos;South African Coast Defence Corps Battalions have nowr received armoured cars. Bren guns and Vickers, and are receiving training by qualified instructors-A fresh drive to release more so-called &quot; key-men&quot; for active service has begun, and all employers of labour are urged to review the position in essentialtrades, replacing men by women wdierever possible.
(10) Economic Activities.Widespread drought conditions have led to a shortage of cereals in SouthVfrica and have had an adverse effect on agricultural prospects generally.   Iner to meet this situation the Union Government have appointed the Ministerfor Agriculture as Food Controller with wide powers to regulate consumptiona.nd distribution.(11) EIRE.Speaking in Cork on the 6th March Mr. Cosgrave said that the Eire Gaelparty recognised that neutrality was the best means of preserving their nationalexistence. But this did not mean that his party would accept the role of passiveand silent admirers of the Governments fickle and varying policies. They hadnot only a right but a duty to discuss Government policy and administration.In his St. Patrick&apos;s Day broadcast, Mr. de Valera said : &quot;If we areaitacked we mean to resist, and our resistance must be no token resistance. Weowe it to our children and our childrerfs children, as well as to the deadgenerations, to preserve what we have won.&quot; Referring to the partition question,Mr. de Valera said : &quot; This unnatural dismemberment at once stands in the wayiif the most effective defence of this island a unified defence organised by thosebest fitted to defend it, the Irish people themselves and in the way also of thatfail friendship with the people of the neighbouring island, which it is their interest, as it is ours, to secure and to foster.&quot;Also on St. Patrick&apos;s Day Mr. de Valera signed the Constitution in its final form. Since it was approved by a plebiscite on the 1st July, 1937, it has beenpossible to amend it by means of ordinary legislation in the Dail. Now it cannotw amended save by a plebiscite.In the Dail on the 5th March, Mr. Cosgrave asked whether there was no possibility of a trade treaty between Eire and the United Kingdom. Mr. 0&apos;Kellyreplied that the Eire Government were not afraid or ashamed to meet british ministers and discuss their problems. They had brought home something ofbenefit and value to the country in the shape of the trade treaty of 1938, whenthey had made a bargain which had enabled Eire to be neutral in the present war.On the 25th March the Dail debated the second reading of the Central BankBill. This Bill provides for the establishment of a bank to be the principalcurrency authority in Eire, to dissolve the Currency Commission, and to transferits powers and duties (with certain modifications) to the bank.The general reaction in Eire is that the Bill only involves a change ofmachinery, without entailing any change in existing financial policy.In opening the debate in the Dail, the Minister of Finance dealt with thequestion of the link with sterling. He pointed out that it could be broken at anytime by a one-clause Bill. The attitude of Government supporters of the Billseems generally to be that the Bill is a move in line with the nationalist trend,and that it provides machinery which inter alia would be useful if it were decidedlater that a break with sterling should be made.At the end of March it was decided by a Divisional Court, presided over bythe Lord Chief Justice, that Eire citizens domiciled in the United Kingdom areliable to military service under the National Service Acts.Michael Murray, an Eire citizen, had been fined by the Leicester Magistratesfor not submitting himself for medical examination, and he had put forward anappeal against this sentence on the ground that he was an Eire citizen andtherefore not a British subject. The appeal was dismissed. The Lord chief justice, in a judgment which dealt at length with the constitutional position,held that there was nothing in United Kingdom legislation which could operate to deprive persons who are British subjects by birth of such status. no action amounting to secession from the British Commonwealth had been taken bylire, though even had Eire taken such a step it could have-had no legal effectsince it had not been recognised by the United Kingdom. Murray&apos;s argumentwas based on the fact that he was domiciled in Eire and therefore an Eire citizen.has argument, however, was not valid in law and he had not lost his status asa British subject on this ground.
Mr. de Valera lias already made a public protest to the effect that the IrishActs detenuine the national status of all persons born in Ireland and of Irishparentage and. in so far as the British Act of 1914 is applied by British courts to Irish citizens, it runs counter to all recognised international principles governing such matters.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.(12) Political Situation.1. The political scene was altered by the Prime Ministers announcement on the 11th March that His Majesty &quot;s Government had agreed upon conclusionsfor present and future action, and that Sir Stafford Cripps would visit India for personal discussion with representatives of the various political interests in orderto satisfy himself that the conclusions would achieve their purpose. Theannouncement was generally received with approval, and political leaders in themain acceded to the Prime Ministers wish that the success of the mission shouldnot be endangered by premature criticism. Sir Stafford Cripps reached india on the 22nd March, and at once entered on his consultations with the Viceroy andhis Executive Council, Provincial Governors, the leaders of the principal political parties and representatives of the Indian Princes. The discussions were still inprogress at the end of the month.2. The tide of alarm and defeatism in India was kept at a high level by thefailure of the Allies to check the Japanese, and by the influx of thousands of refugees from the Far East and Burma. The tangible effect on the war effort is said not to be great, and the morale of the army remains good, but there isdecreasing confidence in the power of Government to keep the enemy away from india and to maintain normal conditions of life and public order. So far.however, public order has been well maintained, the only exceptions beingdemonstrations in some Punjab cities against a sales tax. a riot in a Madras mill,and a series of outrages in outlying parts of Sind perpetrated by the fanaticalfollowers of a Moslem chieftain, the Pir Pagaro. who was himself arrested and placed under detention last October. Local shortages of wheat have caused some anxiety.(13) Indian States.Anxiety, pessimism and a certain lowering of morale has been noted, but thesituation is at least not worse than in British India, and the Chamber of Princes,meeting in the middle of March, passed a resolution reiterating its full supportof the war effort and its confidence in victory.(14) Foreign and Frontier Relations.1. Afglianistan. The Government of India have had under consideration the means by which effective aid could be rendered to Afghanistan in the economicfield, as being the most practical method of maintaining the stability of thepresent Government, and with it the peace of the frontier, and also ofpredisposing the Afghan Government and people towards a co-operative attitudeduring the critical months ahead. Briefly, they propose, while not pressingassistance on the Afghans, to meet any requests for assistance which they maymake in regard to the marketing of their primary commodities. As regardsAfghan imports, they are impressed with the necessity for doing everything possible to maintain the economic life of Afghanistan at a reasonable level, andare therefore prepared to rank the needs of Afghanistan with the operationalneeds of India.   They propose to institute a quota system for imports.The cost of living has been rising rapidly in Afghanistan, and the Govern-ment has found it necessary to fix prices for piece-goods and other commodities.As the result of the severe winter, there has been a shortage of food and fuel, andthere has been a good deal of suffering among the poorer element of the citypopulation.
The fall of Singapore came as a considerable shock to the Afghan Govern-ment and its supporters. Irresponsible elements in Kabul are credited with thehope that further Japanese successes will lead to the invasion of India, with consequent confusion and unprecedented opportunities for looting. On the otherhand&apos;, Japanese domination of Malaya is reported to be the cause of much concern to Muslims in Afghanistan, wdio fear that the Hindus in India will side with theJapanese if India is invaded. There are signs that the Afghan Government are considerably&apos;perturbed by the Japanese advance in Burma, and it is reportedthat they have been trying through the United States Military Attache in Kabulto persuade Washington to make lease-lend facilities available to them for their defence.Sir Francis Wylie has had conversations with Afghan Ministers on thesubject of the post-war constitution in India. While they expressed concern asto the treatment of the Muslim minority in India and as to their relationship with a self-governing Indian Government, the Afghan Prime Minister, at anyrate, made it clear that he sympathised with Indian aspirations for freedom,and he emphasised that point that for the successful defence of India it was essential that the interests of the Government and the people should be united,as they had been so successfully in China. If India were put into real shape todefend herself, Afghanistan would, he said, if necessary resist Axis aggression by all means in her power, but if India were divided against herself, there was little that Afghanistan could do in the face of a German threat to her independence.2. North-West Frontier Province. There has been further trouble inconnection with defence works, and the intervention of troops was necessary inthe Tochi Valley. On the 7th March the Bannu Brigade attacked a hostileconcentration, inflicting heavy casualties. The Rajputana Rifles lost six killed and sixteen wounded. The Bhitanni Jirga, on the other hand, has firmly refusedan attempt to force them to desist from co-operation in defence works in their territory.Gangs of hostiles have been active on the Isha-Razmak road, where amilitary convoy was ambushed, and there have been small raids in the Dera IsmailKhan district, where two Hindus were kidnapped. Elsewhere the frontier has remained quiet.&apos;3. Nepal. His Highness the Maharaja was gazetted an honorary general in the British Army, and his son. General Bahadur, an honorary Lieutenant-Colonel on the 17th March. The Maharaja has lately been worried by the receiptof threatening letters, which suggest the possibility of a recrudescence of themovement against the ruling family, which had to be firmly dealt with about ayear ago.4. Sinkiang. The Consul-General has received a reply to his request for permission to visit Urumchi to discuss matters affecting British subjects. TheTupan, while professing the friendliest sentiments, has regretted that his hearttrouble makes it impossible for him to receive Mr. Ship ton at present. He has instructed the Commissioner at Kashgar to settle all oases brought to his noticesatisfactorily and promptly. This attitude, as the Government of India pointout. is typical of the Soviet-dominated Sinkiang Government. Pressure against our interests has. if anything, been intensified since the alliance with RussiaTrade is at a complete standstill, and everything possible is being done to getfid of the remaining Indian merchants.5. United States. The President has appointed Colonel Louis Johnson,Chairman of the Technical Mission to India, as his personal representative inIndia. Colonel Johnson will detach himself from the Technical Mission, andMr. Wilson, the present United States Commissioner in India, will be transferredelsewhere, the post of Commissioner being held in abeyance for the time being.6. China. The Government of India have nominated Sir Zafrulla Khan,for some years a member of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council, and now a puisnejudge of the Federal Court, to be their representative in Chungking. TheChinese representative in India is to be Mr. Shen Shih Hua.(1-5) Economic.Nothing to report.[23736] c
(16) Finance.Indian Budget-The Indian Budget was passed by the Indian Legislaturetowards the end of March.  The main figures are as follows : Revised Estimate Budget19^1-42 1942-43  million   millionRevenue     ............            97.2 105-0*Expenditure Civil   .........   33-3 40-5Defence         ......   76-8 99-8110-1 140-3Deficit.........   12-9 35-3*(* On the basis of existing taxation.)A fall of  6 million in Customs receipts is expected as a result of the warwith Japan.Out of the proceeds of Income Tax the Provinces will receive in 1941-42 5-i million, a record figure, and it is estimated that in 1942-43 they will receivethe still higher figure&quot; of  6J million. The Governor-General exercised theemergency power conferred on him by the Government of India Act to suspend the reduction which would otherwise &quot;have taken place in the sum to be retained by the Central Government out of the proceeds of taxes on income.The Railway contribution to general revenues in 1941-42 is estimated at 14-3 million compared with  7-6 million in the Budget estimate for the year.The estimate for 1942^13 is  15 1 million.Defence expenditure by the Government of India is estimated at practically 100 million for 1942^13. which compares with about  35 million in the lastpre-war year. In addition, a much larger sum, estimated at  290 million, willbe expended for war purposes on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government (andrecoverable from them) under the Defence Expenditure Agreement.Of the prospective deficit of  35-3 million in 1942-43, about  9 million isbeing met by additional taxation. An emergency surcharge of 20 per cent, is imposed on almost the whole range of customs import duties; this should yield 4.&apos;; million. The Central surcharge on taxes on income is raised from 33  percent, to roughly 50 per cent., and a small charge of Income Tax is imposed on incomes between  113 and  150 per annum which were previously exempt,Excess Profits Tax remains at 665 per cent. These measures (after allowing forthe concessions mentioned in the next paragraph) should yield increased revenue of  4 million. Increases in the charges for postal services are expected to yield f million.The Budget also embodies measures designed to stimulate lendina. Oneof these is on lines familiar in this country: a portion of the increased IncomeTax Surcharge paid on incomes between  150 and  400 will be funded forthe assessee&apos;s benefit, and repaid to him after the war. There are also twoexpedients (one of them applicable to the small incomes which now becometaxable for the first time, and the other to payers of Excess Profits Tax) which do not impose compulsory lending, but enable a person to secure relief from a smaller amount of taxation (in the case of a small Income Tax payer, the whole amount), by depositing on loan not repayable till after the war a largeramount.(17) Naval. Military and Air Force Activities.1.   General Wavell re-assumed the appointment of Commander-in-Chief.India, including Burma and the Indian Ocean Islands 011 the 2nd March.2.   Royal Indian Navy. The Sloop Jumna reached Indian waters safelvfrom Java, having accounted for four enemy bombers in the Sunda Strait.The number of R.I.N. ships now in service and under construction is : In Service : Five sloops approximately 1,200 tons each.One Survey vessel.One Corvette.Forty   Local   Naval   Defence   vessels   (trawlers,   motor   mine-sweepers, &amp;c).
Under Construction : Four sloops (in United Kingdom).Ten corvettes (eight in United Kingdom, two in India).Nineteen Trawlers (four in Australia, fifteen in India).Fourteen Motor Minesweepers (in India).Two Trawlers and seven Motor Minesweepers, four of the latter on order forshe British Government, under construction in Burma have been towed fromRangoon to India.The strength of the R.I.N. has increased from 198 officers and 1,778 ratingson the 1st October, 1939, to 649 officers and 6,735 ratings on the 1st October, 1941.3. Owing to the Japanese threat to North-East India certain troop movements have taken place. One British and two Indian Infantry Divisions(each less one Infantry Brigade Group) and four Independent Indian infantry brigades have moved or are moving into this area in addition to internal security Battalions.The Army Tank Brigade and Indian Armoured Division (less one Brigadein Iraq) have not yet been fully equipped with tanks.The Ceylon Garrison of one Indian Division (less one Infantry Brigade)has been reinforced by one British Brigade Group, two Australian BrigadeCroups and one East African Brigade Group.4. No estimate can yet be given of detailed casualties by categories in malaya or Burma.5. A squadron of the Indian Air Force has taken an active part in theoperations in Burma with considerable success.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.(18) Military.1. During the month of March increased and continuous enemy pressurehas caused our forces to withdraw from Southern Burma, and Rangoon wasevacuated on the 7th March in order to avoid the possibility of our forces in this area being cut off. Our troops were successfully withdrawn northwards and, inco-operation with Chinese forces, reorganised themselves on the general lineProme-Toungoo.2. Lieutenant-General the Hon. Sir H. R. L. G. Alexander assumed theappointment of General Officer Commanding, Burma, on the 5th March.General Stillwell, of the United States forces, has taken over command of theChinese 5th and 6th armies now operating in Burma.3. Prior to the evacuation of Rangoon our land forces were reinforced bythe arrival of the 63rd Indian Brigade Group from India, and the 1st IndianField Regiment.(19) Internal.1. From the beginning of the month the Governor and the Defence Councilconducted administration from Maymyo. It is understood that demolitions were successfully carried out in Rangoon by civilians, who then got away by sea andlanded safely in Calcutta.2. With the progressive deterioration of the military situation the tendency of the Burmans to go over to the Japanese side became more marked. The Premierand the majority of the ministers remain loyal, but Saw Pe Tha, the Karenminister, is reported to have turned Quisling, and two others appear to be doubtfulquantities. At the beginning of the month the Governor visited the Shan Statesand found the attitude of the Chiefs disappointing and their morale not very high. As regards officials, Anglo-Burmans and Anglo-Indians have behavedvery well as this community almost invariably does in a tight corner whilethe reactions of Burman civil officers have varied from excellent to very bad[23736] d &quot;
with every possible gradation. It has been found necessary to strengthendistricts where Burman officers were in charge.Although there has been no recognisable rebellion against the British,considerable elements of the population in Lower Burma have sided with theJapanese. So far as present information shows, members of the Extremist ThakinParty are the ringleaders in this movement. Daeoits and bad characters, who areplentiful in peace time, are also always ready to take advantage of disturbedconditions. But the main stimulus to the movement is no doubt our reverses inthe further East and in Burma itself. The Burmese does not take long views andwould thus be the more easily influenced by Japanese successes and promises, whichwould be taken at their face value. While troops recruited from the mountainoustribal areas. Chins and Ivachins, have done quite well, the Karens settled inthe plains have been disappointing, and the Burmese have done so badly that many have had to be disarmed. There has been a number of desertions from the burma Rifles, chiefly of Burmese and Karens.3. The large Indian population in Burma (in peace time about 1 million)has caused a serious problem. The Japanese do not appear to have ill-treatedIndians in occupied districts, but there has for a long time been ill-feeling betweenBurmese and Indians, and the withdrawal of British administration has in places resulted in the Burmese turning upon the Indian population and lootingIndian property. There has. in consequence, been a considerable movement of refugees to India first by sea and. with the closure of the sea route, by the difficult land routes. This large-scale evacuation has created a very difficult taskfor the authorities.(20) External.1. Work is continuing on the road between India and Burma from Imphalto Kalewa. It is not yet open to traffic and is not expected to be ready for transport on a considerable scale until September, though it is hoped that somequantities of goods will be coming in over it before then.2. It has been agreed with the Chinese that the new route from Assam to china should, in the first instance, consist of a 6-foot track via the HukawngValley suitable for American Jeep trucks.3. A proposal that work on the Burma-Yunnan Railway should temporarilybe closed down in view of the urgent need for labour and materials on other projects has been approved.(21) Economic. .1. Before the war with Japan agreement had been reached in principlethat His Majesty&apos;s Government would bear all Defence expenditure in Burma,Burma contributing in each year what, having regard to her political and financial circumstances, she could reasonably be held to afford. Up to the end of Januaryshe contributed under this agreement provisionally, in respect of 1941-42, at therate of  4-2- million a year.Consequent on the Japanese invasion the Governor reported that Burma wasno longer able of herself to bear the cost even of a very reduced civil administration, much less make any contribution to Defence expenditure,, andthat the ways and means position would shortly be acute. Pending a more permanent settlement His Majesty&apos;s Government have undertaken to guaranteeadvances from the Reserve Bank of India to the Government of Burma to meetthe essential needs of the Administration.2. The main oil refineries were situated south of Rangoon, and in viewof the threat to that city it was suggested at the end of January that sparerefinery equipment should be collected and sent to the oilfields with a view to increasing the output of motor spirit and perhaps of aviation spirit; on the12th March the Governor telegraphed that the current production of the oilfields&quot;plant was 1 million gallons of motor spirit a month, and that additional plant and equipment was under transfer from Rangoon to produce another million gallons a month within two months, with possible further increases. The successof the project depended on the stability of labour, which was doubtful. Thegreater part of this motor spirit will be required by the British and Chineseforces in Burma, but it is thought that a small surplus should be availablefor China.
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.(22) Production in the Colonies.1. Colonial Supply Liaison, Washington.Mr. S. Caine. who was until recently head of the Economic Department, isnow in the West Indies, where he is attending the Anglo-United States CaribbeanConference. Before returning to this country Mr. Caine will pay a visit to washington, where he will examine the working of the Colonial Supply Liaisonwhich has been established there since September last. The Liaison has provedof the utmost value, but an increasing amount of work as regards both Colonialrequirements and Colonial exports has been, and is still being, thrown upon it,and it is desirable that it should be reviewed.2. Cotton Piece-goods.Considerable anxiety has been felt as regards the supply of cotton piece-goods for Colonial markets. Fortunately, India will be able to export more tothe Colonies than was originally expected, but, nevertheless, the position,especially in the West African Colonies, has given cause for concern. Activesteps are being taken to speed up and extend production of various kinds in WestAfrica, but if production, and particularly peasant production, is to reach and maintain its maximum, it is essential that a flow of consumption goods should besecured sufficient to absorb some substantial part of the African&apos;s spending power. Otherwise, there is a real danger that the wage incentive will not of itself be sufficient to call out his maximum effort. Textiles are traditionally theprincipal consumption goods in the West African Colonies, and it is of real importance, therefore, that their supply should be maintained at the highest level that is possible in present circumstances.3. Rice.The cessation of rice exports from Burma is also causing some anxiety. TheGovernment of India has undertaken to treat Ceylon on an equality with her ownprovinces in the matter of rice, and the Colony of Mauritius has at presentreasonably adequate reserves. The problem of maintaining rice supplies, however,in the future, will be a difficult one for these and other Colonies, especially as there is generally no near source for the most obvious substitute, namely, maize.4. Finance.   Currency.The circulation of notes and coin in several parts of the Colonial Empirehas temporarily expanded, generally as the result of troop movements, and inthe case of the West Indies as the result of the construction of the United StatesBases. Some difficulty has been experienced in supplying currency in sufficient quantities, owing to the demand for both metal and paper for other purposes.This question is now being considered with the other Departments concerned.Defence.(23) General.Ascension Island.His Majesty&apos;s Government have given permission to the United StatesGovernment to construct an aerodrome on Ascension Island to be used as a stagingpoint on the air route for the ferrying of aircraft across the South Atlantic andalso as a base for operational aircraft.[23736] d 2
It has been decided on the recommendation of the Combined Chiefs of Staffin Washington that the United States will be responsible for the local defenceof the island during the present emergency. The present British garrison ofone officer and forty-two other ranks will be withdrawn, and the coast defenceguns, accessories and ammunition will be handed over to the Americans. TheAscension Island Volunteer Defence Force, which consists of employees of cable and Wireless (in peace time the sole occupants of the island), will remain theonly British force and will be under the operational control of the United StatesCommander.The United States advance construction party has now arrived at the island.An administrative officer has been appointed and is being sent out fromhere as the representative in Ascension Island of the St. Helena Government.The United Kingdom Government will have the right to use the facilities ofthe air base for British Commonwealth air units and to instal equipment and storage facilities required for the operational use of British forces, provided thatthis does not interfere with the primary United States activities.Caribbean.(a) General Defence Arrangements. The Caribbean is an American defencezone and the United States look to us to provide defence forces in the colonies and islands where there are no United States Bases, on a scale sufficient to engagethe enemy until American reinforcements can be sent. The defence forces inthese territories are being reorganised accordingly. In the Base Colonies, defence arrangements are governed by the Defence Agreement concluded with the UnitedStates dated the 30th August, 1941, and plans are being drawn up between theBritish and American local authorities concerned.(b) Enemy Submarine Activity. The increase of activity of enemy sub-marines in the Caribbean has drawn attention to the possibility of enemy raidingparties on British Colonies in that area. A company of British troops has beensent to the island of New Providence in the Bahamas to protect Nassau, the seat of government, against such an attack. Attacks have been made on shipping in the harbours at Trinidad and St. Lucia, in both of which Colonies there areUnited States Bases.Falkla nd I si a n ds.The entry of Japan into the war has increased the possibility of enemyraiding parties and of one or more of the islands being used as an enemy submarine base. It is, therefore, very desirable that the garrison should be reinforced. Canadian troops are not available and it has been decided not toask for United States troops as this may involve the participation of theArgentine in the defence of the islands, which would be objectionable in viewof the Argentine claim to the Falklands. The War Office have been asked tosend a British battalion.Christmas Island, (Indian Ocean).An enemy landing was reported during the 30th/31st March from twotransports covered by a force of three light cruisers and four destroyers. Theenemy flagship was hit by a torpedo from a United States submarine.Cocos-KeeUng Islands.The enemy has not yet tried to land on these islands, nor has any further report been received of enemy shelling.The Cable and Wireless manager has reported that the population of 1.500,whose main diet is rice and fish, have rice stocks to last until November, but thatthe need for sailcloth and fishing line to maintain the supply of fish is becomingurgent. There are medical supplies for two months, but a shortage of certain essential items. Stocks of other foods, tobacco, clothing and materials areexhausted. The community should be able to manage for some time before the lack of fishing gear vitally affects the food supply., The ad ministrative officer who was designated for duty in these islandshas arrived at Colombo, but it has been decided that in present circumstances he should not go to the islands.
Fiji and Western Pacific.(a) Fiji and Tonga. The United States authorities are developing Fijiand Tongatabu for advance bases from which the United States Pacific fleet and Anzac forces can operate and are stationing United States forces in bothplaces. The Queen and Government of Tonga, who had previously agreed tothe use of Tongatabu aerodrome by United States aircraft, have welcomed thefurther measures now proposed for the defence of Tonga.(b) British Solomon Islands Protectorate. Raids from enemy aircraft were made on the Tulagi-Gavutu area on the 18th, 19th and 20th March.Damage and casualties were slight.(c) Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony: Ocean Island. Europeans and chinese have now been evacuated with the exception of a. few Europeans, viz.,an administrative officer, a wireless officer, a British Phosphates Commissionlabour inspector, one other B.P.C. employee and Father Pujubet. a roman catholic missionary. Otherwise the only persons now on the island are the(Jilbertese and native Banabans. Food supplies are expected to last until aboutmid-August. Wireless communication is still maintained with the island.Kverything (except buildings) of possible use to the enemy has been destroyed,and arrangements have been made for demolishing wireless equipment, policeaiins and ammunition and limited remaining stocks of fuel in the event of anenemy landing.Gilbert Group. On the 18th March a small motor vessel arrived in Suva,Fiji, blunging 32 Europeans from the area in the Northern Gilberts at present occupied by the Japanese. These included government, mission, and tradingfirms&apos; personnel, and also 19 survivors from two American ships torpedoed inthat area. A wireless officer and dispenser remain on Tarawa, headquarters of the Northern Gilberts, and the former will continue to supply informationas to Japanese activities there. One missionary with wireless facilities remains at Beru, headquarters of the Southern Gilberts district, in charge of a largemission boarding school which it has been possible up to the present to evacuateonly partially. Notwithstanding this completion of the evacuation of administrative personnel from the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony with theexception of the officers mentioned, communication is still maintained by wireless with twelve coast-watching stations scattered throughout the Group.Single Japanese planes dropped bombs on Beru on the 18th and 21st March.The former raid was directed against the Government Station, on which threebombs fell, one of wdiich did not explode. On the 21st March bombs damaged the London Missionary Society&apos;s school and headquarters on the Island. Therewere no casualties on either occasion.(d) Fanning Island.. Seven European and Chinese women and childrenstill await evacuation, as shipping difficulties have so far rendered a call atthe island impossible.(24) Aviation.Approval has been given to free grants from the Colonial development and Welfare Vote for the construction of landing grounds in Grenada, St.Lucia, St. Vincent, Antigua and St. Kitts, with a view to the extension tothose islands of the air service at present operating between Trinidad, Tobagoand Barbados.(25) Wireless.At the request of the United States Government approval has been givento the opening of direct wireless circuits between Bermuda and the UnitedStates and between British Guiana and the United States. The circuits, whichwill be for the period of the war only, will be used for Government messagesand not for commercial purposes. The United States Government alsorequested the opening of similar circuits between Accra and Bathurst in WestAfrica and the United States, but the equipment required for the operationof these circuits is not at present available in West Africa.Reports on Individual Colonies.(26) Ceylon.Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton has been appointed Commander-in-Chief, andall naval, military, air, and civil authorities in the area, including the Governor
and the civil administration, are subject to his directions. The civil administra-tion will continue to function as long as it can operate effectively. The arrange-ments for consultation and co-ordination between the various civil and militaryauthorities have been reorganised and the War Council reconstituted to includethe heads of the services and the Board of Ministers.Indians, mostly of the shopkeeper and trader class, continue to leave Ceylonfor India. As regards the supply of labour in the harbour, the latest information is that it has been maintained and that there is no serious exodus of estatelabour.Civil defence measures of all kinds are being proceeded with urgently.Provision has been made for the setting up of war zone courts if necessary.Arrangements have been made for certain categories of persons, including women and children and others who are not residents of Ceylon or engaged in essential war work, to leave the Island.The State Council have passed a resolution requesting that Sir stafford cripps should visit Ceylon, or receive in India a Ceylonese deputation, to discussDominion status for the Island. A reply has been sent stating that sir Stafford Cripps&apos;s visit to the East is confined to India, and renewing the pledge that the question of constitutional reform in Ceylon will be taken up assoon as victory is won.(27) Malta.The attack on Malta by air has increased in intensity during the past month.During the month ended 20th March there were 255 alerts, including 74 raidsby day and 56 raids by night. Casualties were 122 killed, and 175 seriously injured. Buildings destroyed or damaged numbered 622, including threechurches.A supply convoy reached Malta from Alexandria during the month. the convoy and its escort were heavily attacked during the voyage, and of four supplvships one was sunk and one disabled before reaching Malta.(28) Cyprus.Greek refugees are reaching Cyprus from Greece in considerable numbers.Those of military age are being drafted to the Greek Forces in Palestine.(29) Mauritius.Much attention is being given to the defences of Mauritius. Apart fromplans for strengthening the garrison which are being prepared in this country,a local Home Guard has been formed, and Civil Defence Services are being reviewed and strengthened. The supply position has been reviewed and arrange-nieiits are being made for the production of locaily-grown food-stuffs on a large scale.(30) Palestine.During the past month there has been no overt political activity on the Arabside. The violent attacks on the Palestine Government by the Jewish organisa-tions and press following the Stntma disaster, evoked a rather self-consciousrally of Arab opinion in support of the Administration. The main interestamong the Arabs is in the effect of the war on supplies and the cost of livingrather than on the progress of the war itself. There have, however, been signsof anxiety on the part of educated Arabs regarding rumours of Russianpenetration in Persia. Enemy broadcasts have been working both themesvigorously.In both communities there is a very real concern about the supply position.The appointment of a full-time Food Controller as part of a more extensive andstringent system of control was very well received by the public and the press.Other measures include the taking of powers by certain municipalities to fixprices: control by licence of yarns; placing on the market of standard shoes togovernment specifications and at fixed prices; and the introduction of two meat-less days a week. Action has been initiated to ensure that the government securescontrol of the. coming cereal crops.
The Jewish campaign against the Palestine Administration, launched afterthe sinking of the motor vessel Struma on the 24th February, continued through-out tiie month. Public opinion was from the outset fanned by pamphlets andmanifestos mostly virulently abusive and often hysterical. The main objects of jewish propaganda have been to secure the modification of the existing lmmigra-tion policy, and the pinning of responsibility for the disaster to the Palestineadministration by a spectacular marshalling of Jewish public opinion, not onlyin Palestine, but also in the United Kingdom and in the United States.(31) West Indies.A communique has now been issued regarding the setting-up of the joint anglo-United States-Caribbean Commission, which was mentioned in the reportfor December. It is expected that the first meeting of the Commission will takeplace shortly in Trinidad.At a Press Conference subsequent to the issue of this communique, thePresident of the United States took the opportunity to state categorically thatthe United States has no intention to seek sovereignty over the British colonies in which United States bases had been established. The Governors of two of theColonies concerned had reported that there were fears on this score among theinhabitants.At the suggestion of the United States General in Trinidad a road under construction in that Colony is to be called the Churchill-Roosevelt highway.
