I9k2.

MONTHLY REPORT.U.S.A.  and Latin America,,Following the lead given by Mr. Sumner Welles, the RioConference passed a Resolution recommending the severanceof all economic relations between the Western Hemisphereand the Axis Powers, and the suppression of enemy economicactivities in the American Republics,   Although no detailedmeasures of economic warfare were adopted, it is hoped that,with the help of U.S. pressure, effective action will betaken by most Latin American States,   Extensive reservations,however, were made by Chile and the Argentine to theresolution, and it seems unlikely that the latter will take any action at all.Satisfactory arrangements have been made with the U.S.Authorities for the future operation of the navicert system and the coordination of the Statutory and Proclaimed Lists,French Colonies.Vichy have approached the.U,S.Government with tentativeproposals for an agreement on.Madagascar similar to thatconcluded for the French West Indies.    The blockade&apos; ofGerman Europe would be strengthened if it could be arranged for the United States to purchase the total Madagascaroutput of mica&quot;, graphite and. hides in return for limitedsupplies of goods to be consumed on the island.    But theproposals involve a recognition of the political status quoof the island, and this aspect of the matter is, therefore,being considered by the Foreign Office and the Chiefs of \Staff.Spain.The United States authorities maintained their refusal to allow oil to be sent-to Spain from North and south american ports.    In addition to the obvious political dangers of a,transport breakdown in Spain, there is also apossibility that unless they receive oil soon, the Spaniardswill obstruct the-pre-emptive purchases, which we are nownegotiating.The Spaniards have agreed to supply us, over thenext six months, with goods, not normally bought in Spain,to the value of  3,000,000.      This is a good start, andwill enable us to buy useful amounts of wool, skins andwolfram, but it covers only a part of our programme.    Moreover,the Spaniards have made the condition that we should supply them with 2,000 tons of rubber and 600 tons of tin,   - .Portugal,The Portuguese Government have issued a decree establishing a government -monopoly for the purchase of Portuguese wolfram,and fixed-a minimum price far beloy/ the present level.    Theywill probably allot quotas to purchasing countries.    H.M.Ambassador has pressed strongly for a satisfactory share..-fthe available supplies, and&apos; we are hoping that the Americans .will back our claim as vigorously as possible. &quot;Meanwhile,- it -our/
our purchases .of wolf ran in January continued&apos;&quot;at a satisfactorylevel, though prices remained, very high. ySweden. .   .   .Because of the shortage of supplies, we suspendednavicerts for South&apos;American hides.to. Sweden. &apos;-.,The Swedesobjected strongly on the grounds that the Hides were alreadybought, the -quota agreed on only last month, and theconsignment urgently required for Army &quot;boots.    We have,however, maintained our position, and explained that, we cannotgrant navicerts until the hides position has &quot;been surveyed bythe U..S.  authorities and ourselves.    This is the firstimportant occasion on -which we have had-to use. the machinery ofthe &quot;blockade to reduce shipments to neutral countries inEurope from neutrals overseas, &quot;because of our supply difficulties,TurkeyThe Turkish Government have agreed to provide valuable assistance in transporting chrome to ports accessible tothe Allies.They are hoping to arrange to deliver 20,000 tons a month to such ports.    They have also brought under Government controlall ships over 50 tons, thus frustrating German attempts to purchase&apos;, and have stopped all sailings to foreign portsexcept with Government permission.    The Black Sea shippingService has, in consequence, been drastically curtailed, andwe hope that the tonnage released will be partly employed forour purposes.    At the same time, we have been asked forlorries, locomotives, railway wagons, and wagonettes to helpin the lifting and transport of chrome ore.-   The Turks have agreed to prohibit the re-export of allpacking materials of allied origin to German Europe, and abandoned, for the moment, at least, their plan to buy the iraqi cotton crop.    But they refused, our request to controltransit trade from Syria and Iraq, from which countriessmuggling over the frontier to Turkey and thence to Europe still continues.ReliefArrangements for the supply and shipment of the 8,000tons of wheat, which His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed to send to greece are being made by the Minister of State in Cairo, Inconsultation with the International Red Cress.    The wheatwill probably be sent from Haifa.The Swedish ship &quot;Hallaren&quot; is to go to the mediterranean to help carry foodstuffs from Turkey to Greece.&apos;Progress has been made with a plan for evacuatingchildren from Greece.&apos; The Italians have agreed to let thechildren go, and there are good prospects of organising transitthrough Egypt and Syria, but it is difficult to find enoughreception places.
