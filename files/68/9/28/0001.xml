A proposal has been put forward to re-open certain quotas while inviting the Portuguese to make a similar gestureby prohibiting the export of products similar to the commodities involved,for the period of the negotiations.

In the mean-while, emergency shipments have continued and two further cargoes of wheatamounting to over 6,000 tons were shipped from Haifa in the last ten days of May.     It has also been agreed that a small shipment of foodstuffs shouldbe sent to the Aegean Islands under the auspice&quot;3 of the Turkish Red Orescentor International Red Cross.      In view of the Gorman objection to the in-clusion of the islands in the relief scheme, this shipment is experimental.
