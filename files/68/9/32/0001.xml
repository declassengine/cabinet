ihzSPAM AND PORTUGALDetailed supply-purchase programmes, mainly covering raw materials, have been drawn up in co-operation with Mr.   Butterworth, who has been deputed by the U. S. -authorities to advise on U.S. economic interests in Spain and Portugal.     The U.S.Government have agreed to the Portuguese programme and will, it is hoped, approve the Spanish programme before long.     Both programmes would leave a considerable financial balance against us and it is proposed that we should increase the pricesof a number of the more inportant commodities in order to narrow the gap.     Thiswould, however, still leave an adverse balance, at any rate in the case of Portugal,so we hope that both the United Kingdom and the United States will be in a positionto allow exports of manufactured goods of high value and little potential danger,in addition to the commodities specified in the programme.The wolfram negotiations with Portugal have continued, but no agreement has yet been reached.     This has prevented any progress in the War Trade Agreement andin the absence of any agreement on wolfram the supply-purchase programme has notbeen presented to the Portuguese Government.FRSNCH NORTH AFRICA.The resumption of shipments from the LT.S.  to French North Africa is onee moreunder discussion and, to render the position of the American observers less insecurewe have agreed to a preliminary shipment of consumption goods consisting mainly ofcotton goods, sugar and fertilisers.     Certain North African products, includingolive oil, will be sent in return.     We have informed the U.S. Government of ourview that regular shipments should only be resumed on the basis that goods valuablefrom the supply and economic warfare points of view should be exported from north africa in return.     In particular, the danger of the supply of oil has been stressed.RELIEF.Assurances have now been received from the Swedish Government that all our original five conditions for the operation of the Swedish scheme for Greek reliefhave been accepted by the enemy powers.     The condition protecting Greek nativeproduce from forced export has been accepted with the additional assurance that allfoodstuffs produced in Greece will be reserved exclusively for the Greek population and that any surplus which may be exported will be entirely offset by other im-ported foodstuffs.     The Swedish Government are now asking the enemy governments for safe conducts for the first three ships to sail to load-wheat.     The scope ofthe/
the concession is limited to 15,000 tons of wheat a month, and does not oxtto other commodities.     In addition, 4,000 tons of-wheat are shortly to be shipped from Haifa.An application from the Belgian Government for permission to ship limited quantity of milk products through trie blockade for the relief of belgian children has been refused.
