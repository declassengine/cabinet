THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1942.*SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (R) (42) 38.August 25, 1942.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JULY 1942 FOR THE-DOMINIONS.INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.General Position.ALTHOUGH at the beginning of July attention was focussed on Egypt,the stabilisation of the position there and the general feeling thatGeneral xAuchinleck had the battle &quot;in hand&apos;&quot;&apos; allowed interest to turn to thewar in Russia, which has since held first place in the interest of the public, sofar as events outside Canada are concerned. There has, however, beensurprisingly little comment on the battles in Egypt and Russia, and, until thevery end of the month, the majority of newspapers persisted in featuring head-lines of unreasoned optimism, which produced an inaccurate picture of theprogress of the Allies in both these theatres of war. Demands for a second fronthave come from many quarters, and full reports have been given of the publicclamour in the United Kingdom, United States and U.S.S.R. for such action.Despite the seriousness of the war situation, a state of mind approachingcomplacency still seems to persist. The sinkings in the St. Lawrence have donelittle more than cause a mild flutter of demands for stronger defence of the river.2. The attitude towards India has, generally, been one of angry impatiencewith Congress and the Indian leaders, who are thought to place their own interestsbefore the safety of India, but there has been little constructive criticism of thesituation.3. The celebration of the 14th July brought forth many articles both in english and French newspapers expressing affection for France, despite itsignominious record of the last two years. There was general praise forGeneral de Gaulle.4. In domestic affairs, the most important event has been the passage through the House of Commons of the National Resources Mobilisation ActAmendment Bill with a majority of 96 on third reading. Public reaction to theBill has been mild; Quebec has taken comfort in the Prime Ministers statement that he will seek a Parliamentary vote of confidence before conscription for overseas service is imposed. This statement has, of course, irritated the extremeConservatives, who are impatient at the Government&apos;s delays in enforcing suchconscription.5. Industrial unrest continues. The dispute in -the British Columbiashipyards still drags on, but the Unions have agreed to give a thirty days&apos; trialto the Department of Labour&apos;s plan for continuous production. Elsewhere therehave been strikes of short duration, but, though the workers have returned, it is realised that a permanent settlement has not been reached.[24241] b
Naval. Military and Air Activities.o. The latest report on activities of the Royal Canadian Navy covers the months of May and June. During these months, U-boats, concentrated their attacks on unescorted shipping, although the system of shadowing ocean convoys and attacking at night was responsible for the loss of a number of vessels. 122ships were sunk in the North-Western Atlantic during the five weeks from29th May to 2nd July, as compared with 77 ships during the previous four weeks,but trans-Ocean sailings from Atlantic coast ports during June showed aconsiderable increase over May.7. One corvette, one mine-sweeper and seven Fairmile motor launches werecommissioned during May. On the 30th June the Royal Canadian Navy had in commission three auxiliary cruisers. 13 destroyers and 77 corvettes, besidesnumerous smaller craft; the active service strength of the Royal Canadian navy and reserve forces was 4.207 officers and 32.808 ratings.8. Merchant shipbuilding. There are now in Canada 40 berths large enoughto build 10.000-ton freighters, five of them having turned over to naval building.The type of nf.000-ton ship which is being built is based on an English designwith very few modifications, and differs only very slightly from the corresponding-United States &quot; Liberty &quot; vessel. The English design is the product of pooledexperiences of British designers. At the present time, one 10.000-ton ship isbeing launched every four days; up to the present, the shortest lime which has elapsed between laying of the keel and launching of a 10.000-ton ship is 77 days;ships have been delivered ready for service 35 days after launching. There areat present on the building berths 33 ships of 10,000-ton dead-weight capacity,several of them almost completed. 17 in the water being fitted out. and 20completed and loading or already at sea.9. The completed cargo ships are 95 per cent, constructed with Canadianmaterials and labour, whereas in the last war a large proportion of the steel,engines and auxilary machinery had to be imported.10. All R.C.A.F. squadrons working in combination with the R.A.F. were very active during the month with the exception of the two Army Co-operationsquadrons.11. No. 402 Spitfire squadron took part in the rescue operations for wing commander Finucane by providing defensive patrols over the sea rescue boats.During these operations the squadron was attacked by enemy fighters and losttwo aircraft, but in its turn destroyed at least two enemy aircraft.12. No. 406 night fighter squadron destroyed 4 enemy aircraft in one nightduring the month.13. No. 405 Halifax squadron flew nearly 400 hours operational flying in nine long-range bombing operations from which 5 aircraft failed to return.14. No. 419 Wellington squadron took part in several long-range bombing raids and lost 3 aircraft; their Commanding Officer, Wing Commander Fulton,D.S.O., D.F.C., A.F.C., was missing on one of these occasions.15. No. 420 Hampden squadron carried out bombing sorties, mining sorties,sea sweeps and reconnaissances, entailing about 450 hours operational flyingby the squadron, during the month.16. No. 413 Catalina squadron is now serving in Ceylon and No. 417 fighter squadron in the Middle East; both are working in combination with the R.A.F.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.General Position.17. The progress of the battle in Egypt was the main topic during the early part, of July. The reverses suffered produced a great volume of criticism of theconduct of the war, but, when it became evident that the Eighth Army had made an effective stand, tributes were paid to General Auchinleck and the British forces and especially to the work done by the R.A.F. The announcement thatAustralian troops were taking part in the battle produced lavish articles in thePress, but the hysterical attitude indulged in by some newspapers was not shared by the general public. The stabilisation of the situation produced a feeling ofcautious relief; the British were considered to be taking the initiative once more,and attention was diverted to the battle in Russia.
18. The seriousness of the position in Russia was not denied by the press,but confidence was expressed in the power of the Russians to continue their defence until winter should come to their aid. As the German advance continued,attention was turned more and more to the desirability of forming a second front. The immense problems involved by such action were realised by the press,but the general opinion expressed in editorials was that, despite the difficulties and the cost, a second front was essential for the preservation of the Allies.Public opinion, however, has not responded to the agitation, and it is generallyrealised that this is not a matter for public clamour.&quot;19. The Japanese raids on Townsville and Darwin and the landings inPapua reawakened the sense of clanger. This renewal of Japanese activity &quot;cameas a timely tonic for the complacent attitude towards the war which appears inAustralia whenever there is a lull. Demands were immediately made for offensive action to be taken against Japan, and. in fact, for a world-wideoffensive &apos;&apos; action.20. Among domestic affairs, much attention has been paid to the Govern-men&apos;s proposal to limit profits to 4 per cent. A storm of criticism came fromthe Opposition that the war effort would be weakened by the confiscation of thesurplus needed for reserves, and that incentive and efficiency would be lost. TheGovernment decided to abandon their proposal in view- of the complexity of theproblem and the almost certain prospect of the defeat of legislation inParliament,21. There is widespread concern regarding excessive drinking; the general feeling is that liquor restrictions will have to be imposed.22. The coal position is still very serious and demands for effective actioncontinue to be made on the Government. The Government is said to be contem-plating a course which might lead to Government control in order to put an end to the stoppages in the coalfields. Arrangements have been made between theGovernment and the miners&apos; leaders for the application of the National SecurityRegulations to strikes not authorised by the Miners&apos; Federation. The powerthus given to the miners&apos; leaders is criticised by the Opposition Executive in itspublic statement attacking the Governments war policy and emphasising itsown democratic principles.Naval, Military and Air Activities.23. In the Middle East the 9th Australian Division were located on theright of the British position in the locality forward of El Alamein. On the 10thand 11th July the Division attacked and captured the Tel El Eisa position, and during the 12th, 13th and 14th successfully repulsed determined enemy counter-attacks, supported by tanks. On the 16th they succeeded in taking the Tel ElMakh Khad position and pushed on to capture Sanyet El Miteiriya, but thefollowing day, after counter-attacks by enemy infantry and tanks, withdrew&apos;from the latter position and consolidated at Tel El Makh Khad. On the 22ndthe 9th Division again attacked in the Tel El Eisa and Tel El Makh Khadlocalities but met strong opposition, and, after registering a slight advancewere driven back by a counter-attack to their original positions. On the26th/27th a limited offensive was carried out in the wdiole of the Northern sector;the Australian troops on the right gained their first objective at Sanyet ElMiteiriya by first light, but were later strongly counter-attacked and forced backto their starting-point; further south our attack met with no better success, andfrom then until the end of the month the situation remained more or lessstabilised.24. Units of the Royal Australian Navy were operating throughout themonth with Task Force 44.25. Three minesweepers were commissioned during the month. Additionalstorage capacity for fuel oil has been completed at Sydney (12,000 tons) andFremantle (24,000 tons). During July off the Australian coast two UnitedStates and one Greek ship were torpedoed and sunk by enemy submarines, an australian ship was torpedoed but reached port in tow, and another Australianship was shelled by submarine but sustained no casualties or damage.26. In New Guinea on the 22nd July Australian patrols were in contact inthe Kokoda area with advanced elements of a Japanese force which had landed in the Gona-Buna area.   Successful Commando raids in the Salamaua-Lae area[24241] e 2
at the beginning of the month inflicted casualties on the Japanese and damage to their installations.27. United States forces in Australia at the end of July exceeded 92,000.including about 62.000 ground troops.28. It has now been established that M. 3 medium tanks, subject to minor adjustments, can be carried on all railway systems in Australia.29. Air reconnaissances and attacks were continued during the periodthroughout New Guinea, Solomon Islands, New7 Britain and Timor area; protec-tive patrols were also provided for overseas and local convoys and over coastal shipping; anti-submarine patrols were also carried out regularly.NEW ZEALAND.General Position.30. In the early part of the month the reverses in Libya resulted in pressreferences to bungling in supply and leadership and even the most staunchsupporter of the United. Kingdom, the Wellington Evening Post, wrote of theneed for army reform and even of army purge. These criticisms later slackenedoff, and the feeling in the press is that the British forces have averted disastersthat at one time seemed to be threatening, and that a defeat of Rommel is. after all, still possible. The battle is being closely followed., emphasis being laid on theexploits of the New7 Zealand Division which is viewed with pride and. is receiving-great publicity. The military set-backs have, however, resulted in a generalbelittlement of the United Kingdom war effort. United States troops in NewZealand tend to act as carriers of. anti-United Kingdom propaganda and anepidemic of anti-United Kingdom talk was reported to be sweeping through theDominion, despite restraint shown by the press.31. The seriousness of the situation in Russia is realised, and press commentis increasingly anxious and gloomy. There is considerable discussion about thepossibility of forming a second front; and the opinion is widely held that itshould be opened, regardless of the cost, in order to keep Russia fighting.32. Mr. Eraser, the Prime Minister, visited Australia during July, and metGeneral Mac Arthur, who impressed him strongly. While he was in Australia,Mr. Fraser made a speech in which the importance of the Pacific war was emphasised. The renewed Japanese activities have reawakened the sense ofclanger, and Mr. Fraser echoed Dr. EvatUs call for offensive action against Japan.33. The proposal to extend the life of Parliament for the duration of thewar and twelve months thereafter has been amended to provide for an annual review in the House of Representatives, and. this amendment has caused general satisfaction. The operation of the non-party &quot; War Administration,&quot; side by side with the Labour Cabinet, is thought to be responsible for delays that have occurred in reaching decisions on important questions. The division of executive authority between the War Cabinet, the War Administration and the previous cabinet has produced severe criticism; the arrangement is alleged to sacrificeefficiency to party politics.Naval, Military and A ir A activities.34. The 2nd New Zealand Division, forming part of 13th Corps, were inthe Centre of the El Alamein position and were heavily engaged with the enemy on several occasions.35. On the 3rd the Division repulsed an attack near El Qattara, capturing300 Italian, prisoners and 28 guns; having followed this up by a limitedadvance next day they again attacked on the 5th, cleared an area of the enemy and inflicted heavy casualties, with slight loss to themselves. At 2 p.m. onthe 9th the enemy made a dive-bombing attack on the El Qattara locality, whichwas followed up by an assault with tanks and lorried infantry and resulted inthe enemy reoccupying the position. After considerable activity in this sectorfor the next few days the enemy was reported on the 12th to be on the defensive,but strongly established with an anti-tank screen,36. On the 15th the 2nd New Zealand Division attacked and capturedRuweisat ridge in co-operation with the 5th Indian Infantry Division on their right, but the same evening the enemy counter-attacked heavily with tanks and artillery support and succeeded in reoccupying part of the ridge; the New Zealand
Division was well supported by 1st Armoured Division throughout these operations and 1,600 enemy prisoners were taken during the day. Heavy lightingfor the ridge continued on succeeding days, during which the New Zealand division repulsed several attacks and held their ground while inflicting heavy losses on enemy artillery.37. On the 22nd. 5th and 6th New Zealand Brigades, under command of 5thIndian Division, attacked enemy positions South of Ruweisat ridge with heavyartillerv and air support. In face of severe opposition limited progress wasmade, but heavy enemy counter attacks involving severe casualties, particularlyin 6th New Zealand Brigade, caused a withdrawal to our original positions.These were maintained- and the end of the month found the situation stabilisedwith Ruweisat ridge in our possession except for the Western extremity.38. H.M.N.Z. ships Leandcr, Achilles and Monowai were engaged withTask Forces in the South Pacific area.39. Five new anti-submarine/minesweeping vessels en route to New Zealandleft Suva on the 28th.40. General Beightler, United States Army, assumed Command in Fiji onthe 18th. The relief of the 3rd New Zealand Division by United States forces is proceeding; about 5,500 New Zealand troops had returned to New Zealand bythe end of the month.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.General Position.41. In the Union, as elsewhere, the reverses in Libya produced stridentcriticism of the United Kingdom Government and its conduct of the war.Bumours casting doubt on the loyalty of General Klopper in connexion with thefall of Tobruk gained such wide currency that many newspapers came to hisdefence, and the statement by the Minister of Information was welcomed by allpro-Government papers as a final refutation of a Nazi-inspired libel, althoughNationalist papers professed to be suspicious of this supposed flattery from a united Kingdom Minister.42. The rapid progress of the Germans in Russia, the gravity of which isnot disguised, aroused increased interest in the possibility of opening a second front. Government papers weighed the arguments for and against such action,and emphasised that it was a decision which should not be forced by popularclamour. Opposition papers are sceptical of the ability of the Allies to undertakean invasion of the Continent.43. India has been a topic of much interest. Pro-Government opinion is increasingly critical of Gandhi and his leadership of Congress, while Oppositionarguments run along the usual lines, and describe British Imperialism as responsible for the unhappy state of Indians and Afrikaners alike. They doubt the sincerity of the interest the United Kingdom Government professes to feel inthe welfare of the Indian people, and the keynote of British rule is said to bestill &quot; divide and rule.&quot;44. The progress.of the war has produced a feeling of general depressionamong Government followers, and doubts are beginning to be expressed as to the wisdom of holding a general election next year. Criticism of the Cabinet,excluding the Prime Minister, is growing, but General Smuts&apos;s difficulty is that until a General Election brings new men into Parliament he has a poor field of choice. A decision on the Election is, however, unlikely to be taken until early next year.45. Dr. Malan has summoned the Congress of the Nationalist Party to meet at Pretoria in the middle of September in the hope that this timing will coincide with shattering Allied reverses. The Nationalist Party have intensified theircampaign against the Ossewa Brcindwag, and there are signs that the latter&apos;sdecline has been accelerated by revulsion against their violent methods.Dr. Malan hopes to be able to convince Germany of the power of his party, andthus to counter their evident partiality for the Ossewa Brandwag-Pirowcombination, who have openly proclaimed their desire for German domination.46. Two of the three men charged under the Emergency Regulations withcausing the bomb explosion at Benoni in May were sentenced, to death &quot;early inJuly.   The Opposition Groups took up their case with vigour, and the question
became a serious political and racial issue. The Ossewa Brandwag admitted thatthe men were members of the Party, but condemned the Nationalist Party&apos;campaing as political opportunism. The announcement that the death sentencehad been commuted was made by the Government immediately after the appeal court had confirmed the sentence and before the Nationalist agitation could reach its peak. There is general agreement that the Governments decision iswise, but that the capital sentence was a salutary warning to saboteurs.Naval, Military and Air Activities.47. The 1st South African Division, forming part of the 30th Corps, werelocated in an area to the South-East of El Alamein echeloned back between the9th Australian Division on their right and the 2nd New Zealand Divisionforward and further South on their left. On the 10th they supported theAustralian Division in their attack on Tel El Eisa. On the night of the15th.16th South African raiding parties carried out a successful operation,inflicting about 150 enemy casualties at a cost of 40 of their own. On the 22nda battle group of the Division made a limited advance in conjunction with anattack by the 9th Australian Division. Latei on, in the early hours of the 27th,two battalions of South African troops lifted enemy mines and succeeded inmaking a gap for the passage of the 69th Infantry Brigade in connection withour general attack in the Northern sector. 1st South African Division assisted69th Infantry Brigade during their subsequent withdrawal and later withdrewthemselves to their original locality. The front then became stabilised, and nofurther moves or operations of any importance were carried out by the 1st SouthAfrican Division for the rest of the month.NEWFOUNDLAND.48. The Commanding Officer of one of the two Newfoundland ArtilleryRegiments serving here as part of the United Kingdom Forces has proceeded toNewfoundland with a view to stimulating interest in the provision of furtherrecruits for the maintenance of these units. Preliminary press reports indicatethat his visit has been greatly appreciated, and that it is proposed to hold aspecial recruiting campaign in the last week of August.49. There has been agitation in Newfoundland for raising the rate of pay,pensions, &amp;c, of the members of the units to the Canadian scales. In order tomeet the local feeling on the subject, the Newfoundland Government have nowannounced that a credit of 30 cents a day will be paid to Newfoundlandersenlisted in the United Kingdom Forces on their discharge, These payments,which will be made from Newfoundland funds, will be in addition to the post-warcredit of Qd. a day payable from United Kingdom funds.EIRE.50. Speaking in the Dail on the 22nd July, Mr. de Valera dealt at some length with Eire&apos;s economic conditions and prospects. He said that the hardshipswhich a considerable section of the people were suffering were relatively smallcompared with those they might have expected. There was no need for rationing of food if the people set out to provide the food that could be produced inabundance. He asked for the co-operation of all, irrespective of politics. Itwas wrong to say that they were getting nothing for the goods they exported, andit was nonsense to say that they had not tried to reach some understanding withthe British. The British programme did not altogether fit in with theirs, andthe cost of production in Eire was higher than in the countries from which theBritish were buying similar goods. The Government had been criticised for notforcing the situation. There was no use in doing that unless they were preparedto go the whole way, and he did not know if that would he wise at the moment,51. Speaking of defence, Mr. de Valera said that the problem of NationalDefence came first and foremost, and the danger was that the people were not as much alive to that matter as they had been at the beginning of the war. Thedanger had not passed. It was going to remain and, no matter what turn thewar took, that danger was likely to become more and more grave.52. . At the meeting of the Irish Trade Union Congress held at Bundoranat the end of July an interesting debate took place on a motion, sponsored by
the Belfast Trades Council, expressing irrevocable opposition to Fascism.  Dublinrepresentatives professed to scent Fascist tendencies in Eire, where certain,influential politicians and newspapers inclined to a mild type of authoritarianisminspired by admiration of the Salazar regime in Portugal.53. The general view of the meeting was apparently that the motion was anattempt to win a declaration of sympathy with the anti-Fascist Powers and toimperil the strictly neutral attitude of the Congress by a resolution couched inideological terms.   The motion Avas finally defeated by 47 votes to 43.54. On the 15th July Mr. Lemass. the Minister of Supplies, stated in the dail in the debate on the estimate for his Department that, although Eire had suffered less than any country in Europe up to the present, the position was deteriorating and would continue to do so. He said that attention was being given by the Government to post-war planning. A list of industries suitable forencouragement was being drawn up, although the Government would rely on private enterprise rather than on starting industries itself. Mr. Lemass alsoexplained the situation in regard to coal. He said that the Government had started two mineral development companies but had encountered unforeseendifficulties. The total output of the coal mines in Eire was only about one-tenth of the minimum requirements of the country, and it Avas absolutely essential that imports should be obtained at whatever cost. He said that he aa-as perfectlyconvinced that the difficulty of getting coal from Great Britain Avas. the result ofthe shortage of coal in that country.55. The Eire Government have been officially informed of a considerable reduction by the United Kingdom Government in the export of cotton goods from great Britain to Eire for the period July-September, and that no more rayonpiece-goods or Avoollen fabrics aauII be exported for the present. Hitherto Eirehas been allocated 20 per cent, of its normal requirements of piece-goods and10 per cent, of full requirements of cotton yarn. Under the neAV allocation and taking home production into consideration, no more than 30 per cent, of thenational demand can be met.56. On the 1st July Mr. Lemass informed the Dail that Eire&quot;s home-produced stock of newsprint Avas almost exhausted. He said that many Aveeklyand other publications are on the point of ceasing publication. &quot; Last Decemberthere was hope that a home mill would produce hundreds of tons of neAvsprintfrom a Avreckecl vessel off the Donegal coast, but only a proportion of this materialAvas recovered OAving to bad weather and the submerging of the wreck. home production for many months had been almost negligible/&apos; It has subsequently been learned that the Eire Government have made arrangements for some neAvs-print to be carried in a SAvedish ship from SAveden to Lisbon, where it will bepicked up by Eire A7essels. It is possible, hoAveArer, that these Eire a7essels willbe fully occupied in bringing aarheat from Lisbon until the Eire harA^est becomes available.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Politico.I Situation.57. This month witnessed the groAvth of a major political crisis, whichpromised to culminate in open Avar betAveen Government and Congress. TheWorking Committee met on the 6th July, and their discussions lasted nine days.They produced tAvo resolutions. The first dealt with the acquisition of land formilitary purposes, the requisitioning of boats and vehicles, &amp;c, and advisedresistance to military requirements unless full compensation were granted inadvance. The second demanded the immediate withdrawal of British rule witha view to the establishment of a provisional Government, but adA^ocated theco-operation of such a Government with the British, as allies, in the task of meeting aggression. If the appeal for withdrawal were not met, Congress wouldbe compelled to launch a Civil Disobedience campaign. The latter resolution Avasremitted for ratification to the full meeting of the All-India Congress Com-mittee early in August. It represents a compromise between Mr. GandhFsoriginal policy of complete evacuation by the British and Americans (on theground that this would remove any incentiAre the Japanese might have forinvading India) and the more realistic policy of Mr. Nehru, who is concerned to oppose the inevitable Japanese aggression, and is ready to use the British and americans for the purpose provided they become allies of a free India.
58. The resolution obtained no support outside Congress circles. Mr. Jinnahstated that a most dangerous and serious situation had been created : Moslemsshould keep clear of any Congress movement and await a lead from the working committee of the Moslem League, which would shortly meet. Other party leadersurged the objections to a civil disobedience campaign at this juncture. the adverse American comments were given wide publicity. Enthusiasm among the rank and file of Congress was not apparent.59. Mr. RajagopalacharPs efforts at Hindu-Moslem reconciliation made no progress, and. disgusted with the defeatism and lack of realism among hisformer Congress colleagues on the Working Committee, he resigned from Congressearly in the month.60. The expansion of the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council (to 14members, apart from the Viceroy and Commander-in-Ghief. including 11Indians, one of them in charge of a new7 &quot; Defence Department.&quot; on the linesenvisaged in the Cripps discussions) was announced at the beginning of themonth. It was coldly received in Nationalist circles as being a negligible step towards full self-government, but seems nevertheless to have made someimpression.61. The Duke of Gloucester^ three weeks&apos; tour throughout India was agreat success, in spite of its unfortunate coincidence with the political crisis,and must have done much to hearten loyal elements.62. The ban on the Communist party of India was removed on the23rd July, in view of the party&apos;s decision to support the war effort. The decision was well received, though generally regarded as belated.63. General morale (as foreshadowed last month) reacted badly (but not too badly) to events in Libya and Russia, and British military prestige sank toa newr low level. But the difficulties caused by local shortages of food-stuffs andthe general rise in prices are beginning to overshadow, in the ordinary man&apos;mind, the remoter war news.Indian States.64. The Jodhpur agitation mentioned last month generally failed to receivepublic support. Congress has. however, been active behind the scenes inHyderabad and in some States of Western India. But the prospect of active support for Congress in the usually vulnerable Eastern States is regarded asdoubtful. High prices and shortages cause local anxiety, as in British India.General opinion is depressed but not demoralised, and the National War Fronthas made some progress.Foreign and Frontier Relations.65. .4 afghanistan. The general reaction to the Anglo-Soviet Treaty wasthat it was all well and good provided it w7as in fact implemented. There was.how7ever, some apprehension that if Russia takes too prominent a part in the defeat of Germany, she will emerge from the war more aggressive and more powerful and covetous than ever before, while Great Britain and America mightnot have the will or power to resist her, particularly Great Britain, if her positionin India were weakened as the result of political reforms granted to that countrv.To the Russian Ambassador the Prime Minister said that he approved of thetreaty as being a powerful contribution to the peace in the post-war world. Hethought that the joint undertaking not to seek territorial aggrandisement and tofollow7 a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States wasexcellent,66. Further representations were made to the Afghan Government by HisMajesty&apos;s Minister on the subject of the participation of their tribesmen in the hostilities in Waziristan, in the course of which he also reminded them of thepart played by the Axis Legations in collaboration with the Faqir of Ipi instirring up trouble of this kind. The Afghan Government protested that theyw7ere doing, and would continue to do, everything in their power to control theirtribesmen and to maintain strict neutrality.67. North-West Frontier. The situation at Datta Khel remained unchanged and the post was still isolated by hostile gangs and subjected toineffectual shelling. As the tribes, though well-disposed, were disinclined to take action against the hostiles without the support of a military column, it was
decided to despatch a column with the necessary air support. An appeal by theFaqir of Ipi for reinforcements met with scant response from North Waziristan.none from the South.68.   Elsewhere the frontier remained quiet.69. Sinkiang. Mr. Gillett, the new Consul-General at Kashgar, arrived atUrumchi on the 23rd July. It is hoped that Mr. Shipton. the out-going Consul-General. will be able to meet him there in order to discuss with the Tupan matters relating to the treatment of British subjects in Sinkiang.70. Tibet. The Chinese Government accepted without trouble the Tibetans&apos;exclusion of munitions from the goods to be carried through Tibet by pack trans-port, but they expressed a desire to place Chinese Supervisory Officers at placesalong the route. The Government of India regarded this proposal with misgivingas being likely to endanger the whole scheme, and suggested to the Chinese repre-sentative in India that all that would be necessary would be joint intervention inLhasa by the British and Chinese representatives there in case unexpected political or other difficulties should occur. Meanwhile a further report was awaited from our representative in Lhasa, who was instructed to consult the Tibetan Govern-ment as to the most suitable route and as to the organisation of the necessary arrangements.71. It is now clear that the Chinese Government are averse from thesuggestion made to them that, in order to ease difficulties with the Tibetans, theyshould make a public declaration of their intention to respect the autonomy ofTibet, and, as the negotiations with the Tibetans have made satisfactory progress,it is not proposed to press the matter further.72. Persian Gulf. (i) Muscat. A request was received through the UnitedStates Commissioner in India that an approach should be made to the Sultan of muscat on behalf of United States Government for the grant of facilities toPan-American Airways for the duration of the war on the lines of those alreadygranted to the R.A.F. These facilities are required in connection with the ferryservice between Khartoum, and Karachi, and include the use of aerodromes by aircraft under the jurisdiction of the United States Army and the landing of personnel to service aircraft and to operate weather and radio stations. TheUnited States authorities agreed that all personnel permanently based in Muscatterritory should be military. The Political Agent, Muscat, was instructed to approach the Sultan accordingly.73. (ii) Under the direction of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, oilwells in Koweit and Qatar, where production has not yet started, are to beplugged. In Bahrein the first stages of a plugging programme have been carriedout. Wells which are producing are being left to operate for the time being, sothat the Shaikh&apos;s revenues will not at present suffer any diminution.Finance.74. Sir J. Raisman&apos;s Visit to London. Sir Jeremy Raisman, the FinanceMember of the Government of India, arrived in London by air on the 20th July,on a brief visit for the purpose of discussing, in particular, certain problems arising out of the working of the Financial Settlement relating to war expenditure. Discussion of these matters is proceeding,.and the Finance Memberis expected to leave this country again about the 11th August. The EconomicAdviser to the Government of India, Sir T. Gregory, arrived at the same timefor a slightly longer visit. He is mainly concerned to establish and maintain thenecessary contacts with a view to the due co-ordination of Indian financial andeconomic policy with that of this country.Economic.75. Import ControL-Seiore the 1st July the operation of Indian import control was confined very largely to securing economy in the use of &quot; hard currency.&quot; Imports from the United Kingdom and the sterling parts of theEmpire were freely permitted, apart from a relatively small number of items inthe control of which from the supply point of view import licensing was a necessary&apos; piece of machinery. This was good enough so long as shippingremained on the whole adequate to transport whatever volume of goods could bebrought forward for shipment, having regard to increasing limitations on thesupply side. Now, however, shipping has established itself as the supremelimiting factor, and it has become imperative that the volume of imports shall be[24241] &apos; c
restricted and regulated so as to fit the reduced tonnage available, and to ensurethat this tonnage is used to the best purpose. With this object in view all imports into India from whatever source are now being subjected to licensing.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.76.   Royal Indian Navy. Two Minesweepers (Bangors) sailed from UnitedKingdom for Indian waters and one was commissioned.Four Trawlers (Bassets) were commissioned in India.One Minesweeper (Bathurst) was completed in Australia in June, but has notyet sailed for India.A torpedo school is being formed in India.77. Army and Air Force. Ground patrolling on and beyond the frontier of burma has been continued. Air bombing of steamers and barges and of japanese troops and rebel Burmans has been frequent in spite of monsoon conditions. one infantry Brigade has been moved to the Chittagong district where steps are beingtaken to counter Japanese activities on the Arakanese coast and attempts by themto win over the local Muslims by promises of Pakistan. Of the Chinese troopsreported last month to be in the neighbourhood of Fort Hertz a portion is reportedto be moving towards China, and the remainder were expected to arrive at Ledoby the end of the month.78. The situation in the Datta Khel area of the North-West Frontier is unsatisfactory. Two additional Indian Infantry Brigades have been senttemporarily to Waziristan to take part in an operation for the reinforcement ofDatta Khel post and the improvement of road communications.79. The operations against the Hurs in Sind are progressing satisfactorily.One Company of Indian Paratroops carried out a successful air-landing operation in co-operation with ground forces. This is the first time that paratroops trained in India have been operationally employed. The training of a Brigade of Para-troops is proceeding, but owing to certain difficulties in the provision of equipment, particularly aircraft, they cannot yet be employed as a formation.80. The Australian troops in Ceylon have been replaced by an IndianDivisional Headquarters and two Brigade Groups.81. Reports go to show that relations between the troops and the civilpopulation, in places where troops have not been previously stationed, are now generally satisfactory.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.-General.82. The Governor, Sir R. Dorman-Smith, has completed a visit which hewas invited to make to this country for consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and is now returning to India, where the Government of Burma istemporarily established.Conditions in Burma.83. According to Japanese broadcasts, a puppet government has been setup under Dr. Ba Maw (a former Premier of Burma, who had been imprisoned for:sedition in 1940). The other members are for the most part persons of littleconsequence, being members of Dr. Ba Maw&apos;s party and the Thakin party. The-Japanese Military Administration is to continue to control Defence, ForeignAffairs and&apos; the Budget and other particularly important problems. TheAdministrative Chief of the new Government is a Japanese.84.   The Japanese are appointing Burmese District Commissioners, and alsoBurmese Judges for civil and criminal cases.85. The enemy make no secret of their intention to obtain large quantitiesof raw materials from Burma, and have given prominence to ambitious schemesfor extending railways so as to link Burma with Indo-China, and long-rangeplans for hydro-electric development inside Burma. These projects, however, are quite probably of a propaganda rather than practical nature. There are somegrounds for believing that the Japanese are forcing Burmese to work for them.
Evacuation.86. Some 500,000 Indians have been successfully evacuated from Burma,and the stream of evacuees has now greatly decreased, though small parties arestill making their way through and are being provisioned from the air. It isbelieved that the great majority of Europeans, official and non-official, wereevacuated.Civil Servants left in Burma.87. It has been decided that Government servants in Burma (Burmese and indian), who carry on their normal work under the Japanese with loyalty to us and in the interests of the local population, should be credited with their fullpay. and those who are unemployed with leave pay. Publicity is being given tothis decision in broadcasts to Burma in order to encourage such civil servants toremain loyal.Civil Administration in Unoccupied Burma.88. A start has been made in the building up of a civil organisation to administer certain frontier tribal areas not occupied by the enemy, obtain information regarding conditions in Burma and prepare the ground for co-opera-tion with the military when reoccupation begins. Under this scheme civilofficials will work under the direction of the appropriate military commanders,subject to the control of the Governor of Burma as regards general policy. Civilofficers will also be appointed to important military headquarters as liaison officers.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted, sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident. Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.89. (a) Food Supplies in general. For some time there has been an inter-departmental review between the Colonial Office and the War Office at regularmonthly intervals of foodstuff stocks in the Colonial Empire. The scope of this review has now been extended in view of the increasing difficulties which besetmany colonies in maintaining their essential supplies.90. (b) Food sii.ppli.es in the West Indies. Conversations have been proceeding both in America and in this country in order to secure an adequateshipping service to carry supplies of foodstuffs and other essential commodities from Canada and the United States to the West Indies. The position ispotentially grave, but, with the help.of a schooner pool for distribution of require-ments from the main islands, it is hoped that an adequate line of supply can bemaintained.Defence.91. Indian Ocean Command. The military command of Mauritius andRodriguez (a Dependency of Mauritius) and of Seychelles will be transferred from Commander-in-Chief, India, to General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, EastAfrica, on the 1st September or a subsequent date to be mutually arranged between Commander-in-Chief, India, and General Officer Commanding-in-Chief.East Africa. The air command of these Dependencies will be similarlytransferred to Air Officer Commanding 207 Group, Nairobi, under the generalauthority of Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Middle East, except thatoperational control of flying boat squadrons in the area will remain with air officer Commanding. Ceylon, under the direction of Commkncler-in-Chief. EasternFleet.92.   Fiji and Tonga. (a) The change of command from the New Zealand Tei. n0.26Sto the United States military authorities was effected on the 18th July. w^Pac10&apos;&quot;93.   (b) The United. States Government have not accepted the proposal thatthe terms and conditions on which they are to exercise responsibility for defence should be based on the existing agreement between the New Zealand and Fiji24241 r,
Governments. They have submitted a counter proposal for a new agreement,the principal effect of which would be that the main West Indian Leased BasesAgreement of 1941 would, be applied so far as practicable and subject to such modifications as should be agreed between the Governor and the United StatesCommanding General. The Americans have been informed that, subject to a fewminor amendments, we accept their proposal for a new agreement the currency of which is to be limited to the period of the war and six months thereafter.Ms. Nos. 270, 94.   British, Solomon Islands Protectorate. Considerable Japanese navalfronf&amp;Cr&apos;3 activity was reported early in the month and on the 6th July twelve warships,w. Pac. including two cruisers and two transports, were seen anchored at Lunga Roads.The Japanese appear to have been consolidating their position at Guadalcanaland installing anti-aircraft and machine guns, and at the same time maintaining their defences at Tulagi. Reports of conversations between the natives and theJapanese, passed on by the Resident Commissioner, suggest that their object in establishing bases at Guadalcanal may be to attack Vila. Allied planes have continued to carry out reconnaissance and bombing raids. The resident commissioner remains in regular contact with the Intelligence Centres at Vilaand Townsville and the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific has takenenergetic action to bring the possibility of recapturing Tulagi before the AmericanCommanders in the New Hebrides and New Caledonia.95. According to a further report received on the 29th July some 3.000Japanese are stationed in the Lunga area of Guadalcanal and 1,600 in Tulagi.At Lunga the defences include forty-six machine guns mounted on trucks, othersalongside the shore and at least twelve anti-aircraft guns. There are outposts withanti-aircraft guns and machine guns at Cape Hunter, Cape Esperance and nearTaivu. Aola was occupied on the 26th July and posts are being established inMarau Sound. In Tulagi anti-aircraft and other guns have been set up and largedug-outs constructed. There are aircraft bases and outposts at Sandfly and theeast end of Nggela. Enemy ships have been using the Protectorate waters freely :4 warships were sighted off Ramos on the 25th July. Tatamba, Ysabel. was occupied in the middle of July and 4 enemy ships have been sighted in PiekataBay.West Indies.96. (a) Defence Arrangements. The Defence Agreement with the UnitedStates relating to the Bases Colonies provides that certain matters shall bereferred to the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry and the Colonial Office.The responsibilities of the four departments under this Agreement haA7e beendelegated to the Joint Staff Mission in Washington for the period of the war.97. (b) Control of Local Forces. In view of the importance of raising theefficiency of the local forces to enable them to play their part in the generaldefence arrangements of the Caribbean, it has been agreed with the War office that the control of local forces should be transferred to the War Office from theColonial Office.  Proposals have been telegraphed to the Governors concerned.98. Falklands. -The advance part of the British battalion has arrivedsafely in the Colony.99. Ascension Island,. The aerodrome constructed by the United states authorities has now been brought into use as a staging point on the air route forthe ferrying of aircraft across the South Atlantic.100. General. All Colonial Governors have been asked to review the local defence Regulation equivalent to the United Kingdom Defence Regulation 18.B.and to make any changes necessary to bring it into line with the latter.Reports on Individual Colonies.Palestine.101. Our reverses in North Africa have naturally caused considerableapprehension, particularly amongst Jews, Christians, Arabs and those Moslemswho have openly sided with the Government during recent years. On the whole,however, all communities remained commendably free from panic, notwith-standing the disconcerting effect of the sudden arrival of train-loads of personstemporarily evacuated from Egypt. These included not only Allied diplomats,foreign nationals in special danger, and families of foreign and British subjects,but also the staffs of certain British civilian departments and military organisa-tions.   The successful stand and counter-strokes by our Forces in the WesternTel. No. 302from H.Cr.W. Pac.
Desert have done much to restore confidence in the immediate future. TheGerman drive towards the Caucasus has. however, caused concern.t102. As regards the Arabs, it is a matter for satisfaction that so far thestories, so often put about, that they were planning serious trouble for us should we be sorely pressed, have proved totally unfounded. It is true that the fellaheenare busy with the harvest, and no one can foretell what Arab reactions would beto a nearer threat to Palestine, but this recent experience has not beendiscouraging. There are, of course, individuals who would welcome oureviction, in the belief that Haj Amin would come into his own. and they would naturally gloat over our reverses. There is also the lawless element, endemic inPalestine for centuries, which would take advantage of any weakening of ourhold on the country, but it is neither numerous nor organised. The Arab popula-tion in general, and the peasantry in particular, want no more upheavals, and thenear approach of the Axis Powers brings a realisation of what enemy dominationwould mean. There is reason to believe that certain former leaders who have beenbitterly opposed to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the past were considerably alarmed by the prospect of Axis forces overrunning Egypt andreaching Palestine.103. Alarm prevalent amongst the Jews has largely subsided, although keptalive to some extent by talk (politically inspired by Jewrs themselves) of thepossibility of an Arab rising following any further Axis expansion in Egypt.The understandable apprehensions of the Jews have given a stimulus torecruiting. The drive to secure army training of maximum numbers of thecommunity continues unabated. Lack of arms, instructors and equipment impedesintensified training and arming of existing formations.104. The question of what further steps could be taken to meet the persistentJewish demands to be more closely associated with the defence of Palestine wasunder urgent consideration at the close of the month under review.105. The price situation continues to show a satisfactory trend. Stocks of imported wheat are practically nil, and the fact that there will be hiatus between their exhaustion and the time when cereals from present harvest are under government control is causing anxiety. The high Syrian prices have complicatedthe position in Trans-Jordan, so that this Government has not yet been able toenter the market there.106. Jewish recruiting figures continue to improve; the great majority ofenlistments are in the &quot;Services &quot; (R.A.S.C., R.A.O.C., A.T.S., &amp;c.) and not inthe Buffs.  Arab recruiting is still at low seasonal level.107. In Trans-Jordan the Amir, who has been seriously perturbed by ourreverses in Libya, has now recovered from the shock in consequence of thereassuring influence of the more recent news from the Western Desert. ThePrime Minister has been excellent. The population is less perturbed than that ofPalestine.Ceylon.108. The harbour position at Colombo continued to be satisfactory thoughit was somewhat affected by extraneous causes, viz., lack of shipping or transport movements.109. An agreement on Defence expenditure has been reached between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Board of Ministers under which the ceylon government will make a contribution of 27 million rupees per annum from the31st October, 1942, until the armistice in respect of defence to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and His Majesty&apos;s Government will assume responsibility for thecost of the Ceylon Defence Porce. Under the arrangements proposed, which arebeing submitted to the State Council, the Ceylon Government will, remain responsible for the cost of the Ceylon Naval Volunteer Force and for allPassive Defence Services.West Africa.110. Lord Swinton arrived in West Africa on the 11th July and took up his headquarters at Achimota in the Gold Coast,111. An African Committee of the Cabinet has been set up under lord Cranborne&apos;s Chairmanship.
