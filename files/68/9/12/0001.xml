- FEEDING-STUFFSMilk contd.      (iv) Total stocks&quot; of condensed milk amounted to 109 thousand tons at end-January and it is expected that end-Marchstocks will be at about the same level.     Shipments of&apos;   Lend/Leo.se processed milk hove &quot;been suspended during february/April..Fresh fruit &amp;   (i) Of a&apos;; &quot;total shipping programme of 15 thousand tons ofVegetables; Spanish bitter oranges 10.7 thousand tons had arrived upto end-January.(ii) Supplies of green vegetables and, to a less.extent,  ofroot vegetables were reduced by adverse weather conditionsin January and there was some increase in prices.(iii) Sales of carrots for human consumption through the. &apos; ,      : National Vegetable Marketing Company remain low.Arrangements have been made for sales of carrots forstockfeed at 50/- per ton.SweetPreserves:Dried Fruit;OTHERCOMMODITIESTea;-Cocoa:Beer jStarch:The ratio of syrup to jam in the sweet preserves ration willremain at 1:3 until May 4th,&apos;after which it will revert to1:5.Total stocks rose to 57 thouand tons at end-January and arcexpected to increase tc about 05&apos; thousand tons at end-March.The future position, however, is affected to some extent bythe uncertainty of shipments from the U.S.A.Arrivals in January were the highest for any month since theoutbreak of war. and there wasvan increase of over 20 thousand tons in total stocks.     The seasonal rise is expected tocontinue until March.Total stocks rose to 97 thousand tons; at.&quot; end-January and areexpected to exceed 120 thousand tons at end-Ma.rch.It is likely that the danger of a labour shortage in themalting industry will be .averted but supplies of malting..barley are,below requirements.,Almost all .imports- in 1942 will have to, come from TJ. S.A.Immediate .shipping prospects are.such that&apos; allocations to manufacturers are to be reduced.,.., There is little, margin between cereal feed requirements and estimatedsup-plies in February/April, apart, from the reserve of maize.     Milling offals,calculated at 75$2 extraction, represent about 50/ of total estimated cerealfeed supplies in the period. . &apos; &apos;        * &apos;VI.DISTRIBUTIONRetail prices:&apos; The Ministry of Labour&apos;sv index of&quot;reta.il food prices stood at163 on 31st January, the same level as a. month earlier.

Food Offices. :.(iv) The reduction In the ordinary cheese ration from 3 ozs.2 ozs. which v/as due to take place on 9th February, hasbeen postponed-(i) The number of establishments registered for prioritysupplies of unrationcd foodstuffs:had risen to 20,579 at.6th January.
