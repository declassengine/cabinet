THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (R) (42) 48.November 27, 1942.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 1942, FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.GENERAL.Informal Discussions on Post-War Economic Questions.AS a step preparatory to the opening of the conversations with the UnitedStates on post-war economic questions in accordance with Article VII of the mutual Aid Agreement, a series of informal discussions with representatives ofthe Governments of the four Dominions and India was held at the Treasuryfrom the 23rd October to the 9th November. High officials concerned with financial and trade policy came to London from several of the Dominions for thepurpose of these discussions, which were of an informal and exploratory nature and did not commit the Governments concerned in any way. The general result was very satisfactory. Among the subjects discussed Avere plans for the establish-ment of an International Clearing Union, and for the regulation of primary products, post-war commercial policy and post-war relief. The Dominion and indian representatives expressed great interest in the proposals put forward by the United Kingdom representatives, and there seems reasonable ground forhoping that, when the time comes to seek the formal concurrence of the empire governments in post-war economic plans, their response will be the morefavourable as a result of the full exchange of views which has now taken place.Discussion of these questions with the United States authorities should also be facilitated by the knowledge obtained of the views likely to be held by empire governments.commonwealth Supply Council.The. first meeting of the Commonwealth Supply Council was held on the28th October. The Council has been formed under the chairmanship of theMinister of Production to co-ordinate the arrangements for supply throughoutthe Empire. It includes representatives of the United Kingdom, the Dominions,India and Southern Rhodesia. Canada, because of her special position in relationto North American production, will not take a direct part in the work of theCouncil, but will keep in touch with its proceedings. The detailed work of theCouncil will be carried out through committees of officials which will include representatives of oversea Governments.[24660] B
CANADA.General Position.I. During the early part of October the opening of a second front in europe was the main topic of discussion, public interest reaching a peak with thepublication of M. Staling letter. Reactions to this letter varied from sympathyto anger. Stalingrad continued to be a main feature in the news, and enthusiasmfor the Russian stand was higher than ever before.2. The opening of the Eighth Army&apos;s campaign in Egypt was greeted withsensational headlines, a.nd public interest was intense. Comment on the campaign in the Pacific was slight and cautious.3. The German manacling of British prisoners was treated sensationallyin the press, and aroused great indignation, but, after the first angry reaction,considerable opposition arose to the United Kingdom Governments retaliatorymeasures. The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party sent a formal protest to Mr. Mackenzie King against the chaining of German prisoners. l&quot;imes&apos;story on riots of German prisoners at Bowmanville was generally considered asan act of treason; being an exaggeration of the truth, it was calculated to bringharm to Canadian prisoners of war.4. Canada recently extended her diplomtic representation in foreigncountries to the U.S.S.R.. and the first Russian Minister to Canada, M. Gusef,has arrived in Ottawa. Mr. L. D. Wilgress, at present Deputy Minister of Tradeand Commerce, is to be the Canadian Minister to the U.S.S.R.5. Several new Cabinet appointments were announced on the 6th October,three new Ministers (all French-Canadians) being appointed. There appears tohe little enthusiasm at the appointments except that English-speaking canada is pleased at the appointment of Major-General La Fleche to be Minister of WarServices, as he has a record of having consistently urged total war measures,including conscription for overseas service.6. M. Maxime Raymond officially launched in a broadcast a new movement,the &quot; Bloc Populaire Canadien,&quot; the main object of wdiich is the greatest possibledegree of provincial autonomy for Quebec. It intends to act both in the Federaland Provincial political fields, and there is the possibility that the &quot; League forthe Defence of Canada &quot; will submerge itself in the new Bloc. The French-Canadian press is in favour of the new movement, but the English pressunanimously disapproves.7. Mr. Mitchell Hepburn, a constant critic of Mr. Mackenzie King and theCanadian war effort, resigned the Premiership of Ontario on the 22nd October.The reasons for this sudden decision are not entirely clear, but the announcementcaused a great stir in Canada. Mr. Gordon Conant, Attorney-General, acceptedthe Premiership, upon which Mr. Nixon, the Provincial Secretary, resigned,followed a few days later by Mr. Oliver, Minister of Public Works.Naval, Military and A ir A activities.8. It has now been learned that during August ships of the royal canadian Navy helped in escorting 679 ships in ocean convoys and escorted901 ships in coastal convoys.9. H.M.C. Auxiliary Cruisers Prince *David, Prince Henry and PrinceRobert, together with H.M.C. Corvettes Dawson and Vancouver, have been placedtemporarily under the operational command of the Commandant, North-WesternSea frontier, for special duties.10. Strength of the Royal Canadian Navy and Reserve forces at the endof August was : Officers 4,504, and ratings 37,272 : total, 41,776.II. Activities of R.C.A.F. squadrons working with the R.A.F. were some-what curtailed by weather. 425 French Canadian Squadron became operationalon Wellington Ills on the 1st October. The principal exploits of R.C.A.F.squadrons wrere as follows : 401 (Spitfires) escorted bombers, chiefly U.S., on several daylight raids, other fighter squadrons constantly carried out diversionarysweeps, attacks on locomotives&apos; and other minor military objectives, coastalpatrols, &amp;c. 405 (Hal if axes) took part in several bombing raids on Germanyand also went to Genoa; six aircraft of this squadron were lost during the month.419 (Wellington Ills) carried out similar operations and lost three bombers. Theether R.C.A.F. bomber squadrons lost no aircraft against the enemy.
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.General Position.12. Until the opening of the Eighth Army attack in Egypt public atten-tion was focussed mainly &quot;on the Pacific, and the final outcome of^ the battles-taking place in the Solomon Islands was awaited with anxiety. Early in themonth, when the Allied advance in New Guinea was meeting with little Japaneseresistance, a mood of cautious hopefulness about this theatre of war prevailed,but the change in Allied command recently announced and the belated news of losses in earlier action produced a feeling of uneasiness. There was - generaldisquiet about American conduct of the campaign in the Solomons, and relationsbetween Australia and the United States have become somewhat strained and arepassing through a crisis. In both countries suggestions have been made that political considerations have affected General MacArthur&apos;s decisions.Mr. Curtin denied this charge, and General MacArthur himself issued astatement (generally felt to have been prompted) that he had received completesupport from the Commonwealth Government, and applauding the Australianwar effort. It is, however, well known that relations between General MacArthurand the Australian army chiefs are strained. The Australian war effort has been criticised for its inadequacy in the United States press, and for its attitude inregard to conscription for overseas service. The Government has beenembarrassed by the increasing attention paid to the fact that two armies are maintained by Australia, part of one of which cannot be sent outside the country,and the political considerations which have produced this situation arecondemned by the United States press and by certain sections of the Australianpublic as having no place in the present war.13. The continued resistance of the Russians has produced growingconfidence in their ability to retain Stalingrad.14: An exchange of Ministers between Australia and the U.S.S.R.,announced on the 12th October, aroused great interest, and was generally welcomed. The Australian Minister is Mr. William Slater, Speaker of theLegislative Assembly,&quot;victoria, and the Russian Minister Mr. A. P. Vlasov.15. On the 1st October a Bill was introduced to amend the CommonwealthConstitution, in order to give the Government exclusive powers over &quot;war aims and post-war reconstruction.&quot; There was considerable comment in the press,mostly deploring the Federal Governments action as savouring too much ofpolitical opportunism. The Bill will be referred to a Committee, consisting of six Ministers, which will meet in November to make suggestions. The publicshowed little interest either in this Bill or in the Bill introduced by Dr. Evattfor the adoption of certain sections of the Statute of Westminster. Their inime-diate interests are the shortage of various commodities and the new taxation.Naval, Military and Air Activities.16. H.M.A.S. Stuart and Arunta towards the end of October embarked 306troops and left Milne Bay for Goodenough Island; the troops were landed and made contact with a Japanese force reported to have arrived there from Buna.The main body of the enemy escaped, after suffering a number of casualties.17. On the 23rd October the 9th Australian Division was holding theright sector of the El Alamein position between the 1st South African division and the sea. At 10 p.m. both divisions attacked and the Australians rapidlygained their first objectives and had reached their final objectives by morning.The following evening the enemy launched a counter-attack against the leftbattalion of the&apos;division; this attack was repulsed. On the night 25th/26th the26th Brigade, on the extreme right, made a successful local attack in a northerlydirection and inflicted considerable casualties on Germans. During the day ofthe 27th and that night the front of the division was counter-attacked on two occasions; both attacks were repulsed with loss and without difficulty. At 10 p.m..on the 28th the 9th Australian Division again attacked on a two-brigade front;on the left all objectives were reached in one hour, but on the right strongresistance was met, and the forward elements were counter-attacked early thefollowing morning : artillery fire broke up the enemy attack.18.   At 10 p.m. on the 30th the right brigade of the division made a most successful attack north-eastwards towards the sea and cut off several enemy[24660] .  b 2
positions. In spite of enemy counter-attacks, during which some German tanksfinally managed to break through and join the isolated detachment, all the enemy positions were mopped up in the course of a few days.19. Lieutenant-General E. K. Smart, D.S.O., M.C., has taken over theappointment of Australian Army Representative in the United Kingdom.20. General Smart will be responsible for advising the AccreditedAustralian Representative on army matters and will work under the latter&apos;general direction; he will also take over control of all Australian armyactivities in the United Kingdom, including the Military Liaison Office and staff.21. At the end of July there were 492 operational tanks in Australia,composed as follows :  Matilda (Infantry)     ...       ...       ...       ... 148M-3 Light       ............      ... 80M-3 Medium    ...........:       ... 262Australian A.C.1............. 222. At the end of September a United States infantry regiment startedmoving by air from Townsville to Port Moresby at the rate of about 400 per day.23. At a prisoners-of-war camp in Victoria on the 21st September the 800Germans refused to attend an early morning roll call. Their camp leader wasordered to parade them at 9 a.m., at which time a party, consisting of 3 guardofficers and 40 other ranks, entered the compound for the purpose of checkingthe numbers of Germans present and of searching certain hutments. As the.guard cordon was formed the Germans broke their ranks and rushed the guard.Warning shots were fired into the ground by the guards, but as the prisoners ofwar continued to advance further shots were fired, and eight Germans werewounded.   One has since died.   There was no further trouble.NEW ZEALAND.General Position.24. The battle in the Solomon Islands held the attention of the NewZealand public during October, and the gravity of the threat to the Pacific supplyline and to the security of New Zealand were emphasised. Some anxiety was expressed regarding American, conduct of the operations, and their navalcommuniques are viewed by many with scepticism as being too optimistic. Presscriticism in the United States and in Australia has been echoed in the New Zealandpress, and fear is still felt that the gravity of the situation is not fully realised in the United States and in the United Kingdom. There is, too, some uneasinessover the Government&apos;s policy of retaining so large a proportion of the armed forces outside New Zealand. It is felt that the fighting in the Pacific may develop into fighting for New Zealand itself, and that home defence should beregarded as more important than defence of the Middle East. Even that bodyof opinion which approves of the maintenance of a full division in the middle east feels that mobilisation has been pushed further than is practicable, havingregard to the size of the community.25. The defence of Stalingrad continued to be headline news, and thestruggle is represented as vital to the security of New Zealand. Stalin&apos;s letterregarding the opening of a second front evoked a spirited defence of Allied policy.It is reported that, generally, there has been some reaction against the constantcriticism of the United Kingdom war effort, and at a lunch given by the British-American Co-operation Movement, the Prime Minister devoted a large part ofhis speech to the defence of the United Kingdom against the charge of&quot; Imperialism,&quot; and also paid warm tribute to the United Kingdom war effort.26. At the opening of the campaign in Egypt, confidence was expressed inthe British command, and there has since been much jubilation over the news ofthe Eighth Army&apos;s progress, and pride in the achievements of the New Zealandtroops.27. In local politics press comment was fairly evenly divided regardingthe action of the Opposition representatives in resigning from the waradministration. A statement by the Minister of Mines that, if the coal strike had continued for another week, all industry in the North Island would have
closed, has reconciled many people to the Governments concessions to the miners,and led to criticisms.of the Opposition for disrupting the joint war administra-tion. On the other hand, Mr. Coates is criticised in some quarters for remaining in the administration. The activities of the New Zealand Parliament are,however, reported to arouse little enthusiasm among the people of NewZealand. They are apathetic, and, until recent events in Egypt changed the picture, this attitude extended in some measure to the general progress of thewar. There is, however, too much complacency and insufficient realisation ofthe dangers and difficulties ahead.Naval, Military and Air Activities.28. Among the preliminary movements concerned with the preparations forthe battle of Egypt was the withdrawal of the 2nd New Zealand Division to areas area to be embodied in the 10th Corps, which was being specially formed for exploiting the anticipated penetration. After a period of intensive training the division moved up to a locality close behind the front, and on the 24th Octoberentered into the battle; by 10 p.m. that night one brigade had passed throughthe enemy minefields and had deployed beyond with the 9th Armoured Brigadein support. Our initial successes, however, led to heavy German/Italian counter-attacks and a period of bitter fighting before the enemy&apos;s prepared defences were finally penetrated and his armour sufficiently weakened to allow the 10th Corpsto pass through into the open with full freedom of manoeuvre. During thisinterim period, actually on the 27th, the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn into close reserve, and it was not until after the close of the monththat it was able to pass through finally and form the spearhead of the8th Army in its pursuit.29. Total New Zealand casualties from the start of the war until the30th September, 1942, as recently published in New Zealand, are as follows : Killed and died of wounds Army...............       ...      2,492Air Force       ...      ...      ...      ...       ...      1,054Navy    ...      ...      ...      ...      ...       ...        218Total       ......    .....      ...... 3,764Wounded Army.................. 7,139Air Force       ............       ... 67Navy.................. 26Total       .............      ... 7,232Missing and Prisoners of War Army    ...      .......      ......... 8,383Air Force       ............... 614.

General Smuts&apos;s visit to the United Kingdom was received with thegreatest enthusiasm in Government circles, and it was generally agreed that his visit was connected with plans for offensive action by the Allies. On theannouncement of the visit, the Opposition press, on the other hand, began a campaign of virulent depreciation of General Smuts, whose great reputationin the United Kingdom they described as merely a manufactured press reputation.His visit could have no other effect in their.view than to bind South Africastill more firmly to the &quot; Imperial war chariot,&quot; and Mr. Strydom, the Nationalistleader in the Transvaal, repudiated General Smuts, who, he said, did not representthe Afrikaner people.31. The news of the battle in Egypt was given principal place in the press of both Government and Opposition.  Opposition papers made little comment, but
concentrated on the officially admitted difficulties that faced the British forces.Government papers described the opening phase as satisfactory if not spectacular.32. The defence of Stalingrad, and the magnificent resistance of theRussians, continued to hold a prominent place in the press of both sidesthroughout the month. M. Stalin&apos;s answers to the question asked by an Americancorrespondent aroused much interest and comment, and the statement was generally thought to have brought to a head an acute controversy. The Oppositionpress cite the disagreement over the trial of Hess as yet another example of the growing division between Russia and her Allies.33. Dr. Van Rensburg has admitted in a speech a decline in the membership of the Ossewa Brandwag, which he attributes to defamatory stories spread abouthimself. The Afrikaner party, however, under the influence of Mr. Conroy, itsParliamentary Leader, is reported to be moving steadily towards an openalliance with the Ossewa Brandwag and Mr. Pirow, though Mr. Havenga issaid to have no part in this development.34. The Opposition press is strongly critical of the Governments decisionto give citizenship to aliens wdio enlist in the armed forces.Naval. Military and Air Activities.35. At the beginning of October the 1st South African Division was stillin the 30th Corps in the Northern half of the El Alamein position with the9th Australian Division on its right. The month passed quietly with no opera-tions beyond active patrolling until the 23rd, although a considerable amount of useful mine-lifting was done. The Division attacked at 10 p.m.. the 23rd in con-junction with the Australians and with complete success. All objectives wererapidly gained at slight loss. As a result of this attack a salient was formed intowdiich the 10th Corps was thrust, thus separating the South African division from the Australian Division. The South Africans hereafter found themselves on the Southern face of the salient (or corridor as it became later) in touch withthe 4th Indian Division on its left. Although for a time the German armourswung towards this Southern flank it Avas later diverted Northwards to counter the main threat, and it was at the apex and on the Northern face of the salientthat the heaviest fighting took place. The 1st South African Division, however,had its full share of bitter fighting in the initial stages and fully carried out its essential task in the battle.36. The European strength of the Union forces at the beginning of Octoberwas : 16,326 officers and 186,086 other ranks, of whom 1,910 officers and 54,341other ranks are on part-time service.NEWFOUNDLAND.37. The Newfoundland ferry steamship Caribou, which runs between NovaScotia and Newfoundland, has been sunk, as a result of a U-boat attack, with a heavy loss of life, amounting to 137 persons.38. Figures furnished by the United States and Canadian contractorsregarding employment on defence Avorks in NeAvfoundland indicate that, at theend of September, 6,700 men aarere working on the Canadian and 13,400 on theUnited States Avorks. It is expected that there will be a large reduction in this number after the end of this year and that by next spring the total employed will only be about a third of the present number.39. Mr. Emerson, the Commissioner for Defence and Justice, has been on a visit to this country Avith a vieAV to seeing the NeAvfoundland forces here,EIRE.40. There is hoav every indication in Eire that the general election duenext year will not be postponed by agreement among the parties. Speakingon the 23rd October, Mr. Boland, the Minister of Justice, said that there wasno sign of its being deferred after June. All the signs were that there Avouldbe one before. Fie said that Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s recent speech indicated preparations for an Election and the Labour Party seemed to want one too. Fianna Fail,,therefore, required to tighten up its organisation and he felt sure that FiannaFail Avould again form a Government.
41. Mr. Boland was the first member of the Eire Government to make any definite statement on the prospects of a General Election, but what the IrishTimes describes as a &quot; frankly electioneering speech &quot; was made by Mr. Lemass,Minister for Supplies, at a Dublin meeting a few&apos; days later. Ostensibly theoccasion was intended to mark the reorganisation of the Fianna Fail party which, Mr. Lemass said, was necessary because in the national interest Partyactivity had for some time been relaxed and in consequence the Governmentsadministration had been menaced. He thought that it was preposterous tosuggest that because neutrality was supported by all sections, people need notbe concerned as regards their political allegiances.42. At a mass meeting in Dublin on the 4th October, representatives ofthe Labour Party condemned the failure of the Government to provide adequate supplies of essential food and fuel at prices within the means of consumers.The resolution also demanded the restoration of the workers&apos; right to conduct negotiations with employers through collective bargaining. Mr. Norton, the leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party, said that the workers were determined that the Orders removing these rights must go, and if necessary, theGovernment should go with them. At this same meeting, Mr. Norton took theopportunity of remarking  hat &quot; Neutrality was not an issue in any electionthat might take place. Any Government that tried to press the Irish peopleinto the war would not last 24 hours.&quot;43. It has been decided to issue an Order under the Defence Regulationsinstituting a system of control over persons entering Northern Ireland whetherfrom Great Britain or from Eire, whereby all persons not resident in NorthernIreland on the 1st January, 1940, who wish to remain there for more than six weeks are required to obtain a special permit. Though primarily intended todeal with war conditions, the measure may be used when the time comes forreinstating demobilised volunteers from Northern Ireland in employment afterthe war.Commenting on this scheme, the Irish Times of the 10th October, aftercriticising those who were guilty of bomb outrages in Northern Ireland, says :&quot; They are playing into the hands of those who are determined at all costs toperpetuate the partition of this little island; and the mere fact that visitorsfrom the south must now obtain a special permit if they wish to stay for morethan six weeks in the northern area ought to be sufficient proof of the damage which has been done of late to the cause which every decent Irish citizen oughtto have at heart.&apos;&apos;44. Mr. Lemass, announcing a national transport plan in the Dail in themiddle of October, said that Eire was facing a transport problem which mightbe the greatest problem which the war had presented. They had not succeeded in any month of 1942 in bringing petrol consumption below the allocation forthat month. There was an obligation on the Government to see that in each areathere was an organised transport service for carrying necessaries and he hintedthat they would have to reduce the number of lorries on the road by 50 per cent.They had reached a situation now where they had to consider whether the petrolsupplies should not be retained for the use of public transport services ratherthan go out to private owners. &quot;At any moment,&quot; he said, &quot;it is possiblethat we might find ourselves without petrol at all.&quot;45. The much debated Central Bank Bill has now passed through theReport and Final stages in the Senate.46. In order to ensure, as far as possible, that excessive rates of freightshall not be paid by Irish importers and that the most essential goods shall begiven priority when any foreign tonnage becomes available for bringing supplies to Eire, the Government has prohibited, except under licence, the chartering offoreign ships or the making of arrangements for the carriage of goods in such ships.   The Order does not apply to traffic between Eire and the United Kingdom.47. The return issued on the 28th October shows that in September,1942, Eire imports were valued at  3,050,255; as compared with  2,329,158 inthe same month in 1941. Exports also show an increase at  2,432 077 comparedwith  2,323,319 in September, 1941. The total trade for the month was 5,482,332 and the adverse balance of imports over exports was  618,178.48. The export of live animals in the month totalled  1,428,461 comparedwith  629,746 in September, 1941. There was a decrease in food, drink and tobacco exports from  1,464,805 to  801,590.
INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political Situation.49. The internal situation generally improved throughout October. Normalconditions have not yet been completely restored, but the disturbances and sabotage which have persisted here and there, particularly in Bengal and Bombay,have been for the most part on a minor scale. For the time being, so far as canbe judged, the danger of a mass movement has passed. There is, however, anunderground current of unrest and possibly of revolutionary activity which mightwell lead to mass disorder in the event of a serious enemy attack on India by landor air. Communal unrest is for the time being quiescent, and labour on the wholeis giving little trouble, except in Ahmedabad, where the cotton mills which closed down in August have not yet reopened.50. No significant advance has been made to a solution of the politicalissue. The efforts of the Hindu Mahasabha to promote agreement among theparties have failed (as was inevitable) to secure the support of the Moslem League,a fact pointed out by the Prime Minister in the acknowledgment sent on his behalfto a telegram addressed to him by the President of the Hindu Mahasabha, whoclaimed the existence of a &quot; national demand &quot; for the transfer of power to anational Indian Government, Later in the month some interest was aroused(possibly more in England than in India, where the reception is said to have beentepid) by proposals put forward by Mr. Rajagopalachari for the transfer of power except for the reservation to His Majesty&apos;s Government of the control ofdefence to a provisional Government in which the Moslem League would beallowed to nominate as many members as they wished to sit with five Congressmembers and three members representative of other interests. This ministry would be responsible to a new- Legislature indirectly elected by the provincial legislatures after the latter had been brought up to date by fresh general elections in the Provinces. The author of the proposals does not attempt to show howHis Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s control of defence would be effectively exercised, orhowr a Ministry would survive which would certainly not represent the politicalcomplexion of the new Legislature to which it is to be responsible. The proposals may well be mainly designed to discredit the Moslem League for rejecting whatpurports to be a constructive proposal to end the political deadlock.Indian States.51. It is reported that, generally speaking, disorderly activity has continuedto subside and depends mainly upon students, who are beginning to be regardedas a nuisance. Serious incidents were reported from Mysore and from two of theOrissa States, and, in addition, there were signs of communal friction inHyderabad, Kashmir and Jodhpur. Morale continues to be fairly firm andalarmist rumours have tended to decline.External and Frontier A fairs.52. Afghanistan. His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul had an inconclusiveinterview- with the Afghan Prime Minister on the 26th September which shedlittle further light on the latter&apos;s present attitude. Despite everything that sir F. Wylie could say, it was clear that the Prime Minister still thought thatthe Germans would penetrate the Caucasus in the spring and was pessimisticregarding the Indian situation, although he professed, not altogether con-vincingly, to believe that the United Nations would win the war. In response toSir F. Wylie&apos;s reminder that His Majesty&apos;s Government relied on him to live upto his assurance given in March 1941 that, so long as he was Prime Minister,Afghanistan would not be a source of embarrassment to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the war, he said (a trifle perfunctorily) that he had not changed his policy.The question has been considered whether we should take any further action toreduce the danger that the pessimistic views of the Mghan Government regardingthe war situation may lead them to collaborate with the Axis. It has, however^been decided, partly in view of the difficulty of taking effective action at themoment, to content ourselves with watching the position.
53. The main market for lambskins, which are Afghanistan^ most valuable export and the chief support of the conn try&apos;s economy, is the UnitedStates. Recent changes, however, in the United States import licensing systemintroduced a ban on the import of lambskins into the United States, and theState Department consulted His MajestyV Government on the question whether,in order to enable this ban to be got round, lambskins should be bought by theUnited States Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government or the Government ofIndia- As it is our general policy not to help the Afghan Government unless they seek our assistance, in order to emphasise their economic dependence, on us;as their general attitude is not entirely satisfactory (as is indicated above); andas there is a large quantity of Afghan lambskins already in the United Statesunsold, the United States Government were advised that it would be preferable to take no action for the moment.North-West Frontier. .54. Tribal territory has been generally quiet during October. It is now clear of Congress emissaries, who seem to have achieved nothing there.55. China.- The Chungking Government seem to have gone some way towards re-establishing their control over Sinkiang, and the Soviet Governmentare now said to deal with them regarding the Province instead of with theProvincial Government, as hitherto. Messrs. Shipton and Gillett, the retiringand incoming Consuls-General at Kashgar, met at Urumchi (the capital of theProvince) in September. They were very satisfied with their reception there, andbelieve that there are solid grounds for hoping for a real improvement in therelations between India and Sinkiang.56. The Government of India have agreed to participate in the conclusionof a Treaty with the Chinese Government for the surrender of extra-territorial rights, although it may be necessary to make some reservation on behalf ofIndia in respect of the article in the draft treaty which would give Chinesenationals rights in respect of travel, residence and trade in British territory. -57. The Chinese and American military authorities put forward proposalsfor a substantial increase in the 10,000 Chinese troops now under training atRamgarh, in India. There were some political disadvantages to this proposal,as a large body of Chinese troops might in certain circumstances prove embarras-sing guests in India and their participation in a reconquest of Burma might increase the weight of Chinese claims to a voice in the settlement of Burma&apos;future. There also seemed to be serious practical difficulties in the way oftransport by air from China of a large number of men. The rejection of theproposal, however, would have been taken very amiss by our Allies, and it wastherefore accepted in principle. Generals Wavell and Stillwell are examining thepractical difficulties, and the movement of troops has started.United States.58. In view of the danger that the United States Government might be led,by pressure of American public opinion and by lack of well-informed adviceregarding the Indian situation upon which they would be ready to rely, to take some unfortunate initiative in respect of India, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Washington, was asked, with the Viceroy&apos;s agreement, to inform the United StatesGovernment that we would welcome the filling of the post of United StatesCommissioner at New Delhi (which has been in charge of a Secretary for somemonths) by an officer of standing and experience who could give his Governmentreliable and objective advice regarding Indian political developments. lord halifax was asked to emphasise the dangers of an offer of mediation in india by the United States Government, and to say that for this reason a foreign service officer would be preferable to an active politician whose ambitions mightimpel him to interfere in Indian politics. Lord Halifax carried out these instructions on the 2nd October. His approach was well received and he was told that the President had under consideration candidates who fulfilled our wishes.The President has, however, still taken no decision in the matter.Economic and Finance.59.

Two mine-sweepers (Bangors) were commissioned in the UnitedKingdom and are undergoing trials.62. Military. As reported in the press, General Wavell made a tour ofcertain areas in Northern Burma during the month.63. There are indications that Japanese troops and hostile Arakanese areattempting to occupy the coast north of Akyab. The identification of Japanesein the Chin Hills points to a more aggressive policy in that region. The UpperChindwin is so far reported to be clear of the enemy, but they are in some strength in the Kalewa area. North of Myitkyina, .in the Hukawng Valley, hostileBurmans have shown activity. In view of the above, certain readjustments ofthe Eastern Army locations have been carried out. The reorganisation of thisArmy is making stead)&apos; progress enabling a general strengthening of ourdispositions to be made. Our troops and guerrillas have continued activepatrolling and minor clashes with the enemy have occurred, casualties beinginflicted. There has been a high incidence of a persistent type of malaria duringthe rainy season which has seriously interfered with preparations for active operations. Communication difficulties have interfered with hospital arrange-ments and ration supplies, but the situation, though still serious, is improving.64.   Air. -Improved weather conditions have permitted greater activity.65. Enemy reconnaissance of the Assam-Calcutta area has been increasinglymaintained and airfields in Northern Assam have been bombed. There has beenenemy activity round Akyab in support of shipping.66. Our forces have carried out extensive shipping escorts, A/S patrols,coastal sweeps and sea reconnaissances over the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengaland Ceylon areas. Attacks were made on two enemy mine-sweepers, one ofwhich was promising. In the area Chittagong-Akyab a number of fightersweeps and interception patrols were flown. *Successful attacks were made onAkyab, Yenangyaung oilfield, Kalewa, Pakokku and marshalling yards atYwataung.

The issue of Field Servicescales of rations (less cigarettes and tobacco) to all British troops has been sanctioned.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.69. A summary has been received from the Government of Burma of somereports about the early stages of the Japanese occupation. According to theseit seems that Dr. Ba Maw&apos;s administration under Japanese control and a japanese police force were set up to maintain order in opposition to &quot; FreeBurmese Administrations &quot; supported by the Burma Independence Army. Thelatter has been reorganised under the control of the Japanese military andrenamed the Burma Defence Army. The dacoity element in it has probably beenpurged and it may now mainly consist of the politically conscious yrouth, whoseloyalty to Japan will depend on the amount of freedom granted by the latter to Burma. Japanese propaganda plays up to Burmese self-esteem and sense of independence.70. In accordance with the proposal approved last August the Governmentof Burma have formed a department to study questions of reconstruction in burma after reoccupation.
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &apos;: Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is nsed to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.71. Reference was made in the May and June reports to the shippingprogrammes that were in preparation for East and West Africa. These are nowin operation.72. Details of cargo awaiting shipment are obtained and the more urgentgoods are being shipped to East Africa on the basis of priority markings on theimport licences, and to West Africa (in consultation with the West AfricanSupplies Committee) in the light of information given in periodical telegrams from the Colonies.73. Progress has been made in introducing shipping programmes for other areas. The West Indian Colonies were asked during October to prepareschedules of the goods that they needed to import from the United Kingdom upto June 1943. They are already giving similar information about their require-ments from the United States to the British Colonies Supply Mission in Wash-ington, and it has become necessary to obtain a complete picture of their needs for shipping space from all areas. Programmes of requirements have also beenreceived from Ceylon, Mauritius and Seychelles, and these are under discussionwith the Ministry of War Transport with a view to the provision of tonnage for essential requirements. With these programmes in operation it should be possibleto ensure that the more urgent commodities are shipped and that the accumula-tions of cargo for shipment to all these areas will be gradually worked off. Insome cases it will be necessary to cancel import licences for commercial ordersfor which there is no prospect of obtaining shipping space.Defence.Western Pacific.74. (a) Fiji and Tonga. Sir Philip Mitchell has recently paid a short but Tol.No.405very successful visit to New Zealand, where he discussed with the New Zealand ^Pp^ Cr&quot;Prime Minister, War Cabinet and Chief of the General Staff the proposals forthe expansion of the Local Defence Forces in Fiji and Tonga, which were described in paragraph 104 of the September Report. The New Zealand Govern-ment have agreed to provide the additional personnel required for the expansionof the Fiji Defence Force and to undertake responsibility for arranging for thesupply of new equipment. The proposals for expanding the Tonga Defence force are still under consideration locally.75. (b) British Solomon Islands Protectorate.

In agreementwith the three. Service Commanders he has made several recommendations regarding the air defence of West Africa both against land attack and againstsubmarine.Reports on Individual Colonies.77.   Palestine. There was no political activity among the Arabs.   Jewishpolitical activity continues. ,
78. Local purchase of cereals continues satisfactorily in Palestine, but ishanging fire in Trans-Jordan owing to extreme sensitiveness of the market. Theannouncement that the points system for essential food-stuffs will be introduced on the 1st November has occasioned some grumbling. This may be largely due tothe fact that many are unable to appreciate the ultimate advantages to themselves of the food restrictions. There is an unpleasant tendency in Arab circles tosuggest that this further complication in daily life has been imposed solely forthe benefit of the Jews. The tendency of Jewish criticism is to suggest that thescheme is for the benefit of the bourgeoisie at the expense of the workers.79. There has again been some improvement in Jewish recruiting, but little change in Arab recruitment.80. Northern Rhodesia. In the report for September reference was madeto the deterioration in the situation at the Copperbelt. Northern Rhodesia. Onthe 5th October the Governor, under the provisions of the Northern RhodesiaEmergency Powers Regulations, ordered the detention of three men who were engaged in subversive activities in the Copperbelt area. These detentions werenot attended by any untoward incident, work is proceeding normally, and therehas been no interruption of copper production.81.
