Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (R) (42) 10.February 23, 1942.WAR CABINET.REPORTS EOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY 1942 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA, AND THE colonies and MANDATED TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.(1) General Position.Mr. ChurchilEs Ottawa speech had a most enthusiastic press reception andthe French press was prepared to agree that the references to Vichy, though hard,were &quot; just.&quot; Newspapers showed great relief when the news was made public that Mr. Churchill had safely arrived back in the United Kingdom, and therewas further enthusiastic reference to his speech, and the Vote of Confidence, inthe House of Commons. The Allied agreements, and the appointment ofGeneral Wavell, both had a popular reception in Canada.The Canadian press has shown great concern about the position in Libyaand in the Far East, although the method of reporting has been somewhatinconsistent. Any cheerful news has been greatly magnified and over-stressed,and this exaggerated cheerfulness has alternated with moods of extreme pessimismand concern. It is obvious that Canadian public opinion has little confidence that Singapore can hold out, and no attempt is made in the press to prophesythe future developments in the Pacific war.In foreign affairs the notable Russian successes have been continuouslyfeatured, and the conferences between Mr. Eden and M. Stalin were given a goodpress, and regarded as most satisfactory. From several sources there has comea demand for closer relations between Canada and the Soviet Union.The Pan-American Conference was followed with much interest, but there&apos;has been no revival of the former demand that Canada should participate. Theattitude of the Argentine was condemned as short-sighted, and the agreementultimately reached had only a very tepid press.In domestic affairs the Canadian public as a whole approved of thearrangement for granting financial aid to Britain, and the grateful messagesreceived from the United Kingdom were noted with much pleasure. The maininterest during the month centred around the Government &apos;s decision to hold a plebiscite asking for a release from the undertaking given in 1940 regardingconscription. The Canadian political scene became disturbed, and there was some mild rioting in Quebec. Newspaper comment, so far, has been divided between those newspapers which believe that the present course is the only possible one open to the Government, and those which argue that the change inthe war situation since March 1940 is such that the Government is automaticallyreleased from undertakings then made. The Quebec newspapers have not yetmade up their minds, and apparently further elucidation by the Government isawaited.[23493] b
Mr. H. Mitchell, Chairman of the National War Labour Relations Board,has been appointed as the new Minister of Labour.Mr. Meighen, who accepted the leadership of the Conservative party, was defeated in a recent by-election.(2) Naval, Military and Air Activities.On the 1st January, 1941, 12 destroyers plus a few auxiliary craft comprisedthe total Canadian naval force taking part in the Allied war effort. At thepresent time, this force comprises three auxiliary cruisers, 13 destroyers,66 corvettes, besides a vastly increased number of auxiliary craft of everydescription. It is anticipated that the following additional ships will becompleted during the coming year : 2 &quot; Tribal &quot;-class destroyers, 15 corvettes anda number of mine-sweepers and motor launches. It is expected that the totalnumber of officers and men of the Royal Canadian Navy will reach 40,000 by march 1943.An increasing number of Canadian corvettes are taking their place withthe Newfoundland escort force as they are turned out from Canadian shipyards.Lieutenant-General H. D. G. Crerar, D.S.O., has assumed command of canadian Corps District.Corps Divisional and Brigade Headquarters took part in a tactical exereisewithout troops, conducted with the object of familiarising staffs with variousoperational duties.During January, extremely bad weather conditions seriously reduced boththe operational and training activities of the Royal Canadian Air Force squadrons. No. 401 (fighter) Squadron is now composed entirely of R.C.A.F.personnel, and Nos. 402 and 412 (fighter) Squadrons are completely Canadianas regards air crews. The Commanding Officer of No. 403 (fighter) Squadronwas awarded the D.F.C. during the month. No. 404 (fighter) Squadron wascredited with one probable and one possible enemy aircraft destroyed, in eachcase a Heinkel bomber. No. 405 (bomber) Squadron attacked Cherbourg,St. Nazaire, Emden and Bremen (twice). No. 408 Squadron raided Cherbourg(twice), Brest (twice), Wilhelmshaven, Hamburg, Dunkirk, Bremen and Emden.They were also engaged in mine-laying operations. Two aircraft were lost duringbombing raids. No. 419 Squadron was sent to Brest, Hamburg and Boulogne,and lost one aircraft. No. 420 Squadron carried out five sorties over Germanyand lost one aircraft. No. 413 Squadron (Catalinas) were engaged on convoypatrols and anti-submarine sweeps, and again experienced severe weather conditions. No. 407 Squadron (Hudsons) again had many successes against shipping; they were operating chiefly off the Danish coast, and several direct hits on ships of various sizes were seen.There are now twenty-one R.C.A.F. squadrons which are operational withthe Royal Air Force.(3) Economic Activities.Mr. Mackenzie King announced to the Canadian House of Commons on the26th January that the Canadian Government were proposing new financial arrangements to the United Kingdom Government.These fell into two parts. First, the Canadian Government had beenaccumulating large holdings of sterling to enable the United Kingdom Govern-ment to finance its purchases in Canada. The greater portion of these wouldhe converted into a loan of $700,000,000 free of interest during the war. TheUnited Kingdom Government would also carry a stage further the process of repatriation of Canadian securities to realise dollars by repatriating theremaining Dominion Government and Canadian National Railway Securitiesheld in the United Kingdom, amounting to some 1295,000,000.Secondly, for the future, the Canadian Government would ask Parliamentto make provision for meeting the United Kingdom&apos;s shortage of Canadiandollars by supplying free of charge and without obligation munitions of war, rawmaterials and food-stuffs up to a value of $1,000,000,000. This immense gift,the announcement of which has been well received in Canada, has exceeded allexpectations, and should meet our needs of Canadian dollars until early in 1943.Announcements were also made of a number of measures to reduce theconsumption of materials in short siipply.   The processing of rubber has been
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.(4) General Position.Relief and satisfaction have been expressed in Australia at the formationof a unified Allied command, and the Allied agreements. There has been a distinct tendency to make political capital out of these events by claiming credit for the Commonwealth Government for its share in bringing about these results,some sections of the press claiming that Mr. CurtinV declaration played a decisive part, and arguing that the results achieved in Washington would havebeen less satisfactory if the Commonwealth Government had adhered to thenormal methods of consultation. The Government and press have combined tobuild up in the public mind the idea that, partly owing to the inefficiency of theMenzies Government and partly owing to the United Kingdom failure properlyto appreciate the Far Eastern situation, Australia would have been left in thelurch, had it not been for the &apos;&apos; realism &apos;&apos; shown by the Curtin Government. the continuous spate of Allied reverses in the Far East naturally caused grave concern throughout Australia, and a growing fear that the Australian Continentwould itself be the subject of a Japanese attack became stronger as the monthprogressed. One result was tha,t urgent demands for further reinforcements for singapore and the Netherlands East Indies continued to be made. Muchsatisfaction was felt over the work done by the A.I.F. in Malaya, but once againthere has been lively criticism of the events which involved a heavy loss of australian life. As apprehension increased, so also did the clamour for australian representation in the War Cabinet.Interest in other foreign affairs has naturally been of secondary importance,although there has been whole-hearted admiration for the Russian victories andfor the successes of the Chinese armies.At home there has been an increasing demand for the amendment of theDefence Act to enable the Australian Militia to be sent overseas, although some sections of the press have taken the line that Australian forces in the middle east should be brought back to defend Australia^ &quot; Near North.&quot;In domestic affairs a coal strike at twenty-six New South Wales mines, in defiance of Union instructions, caused the Commonwealth Government muchtrouble. The Government invoked the National Security Regulations, whichwould have placed the mines under Government control, and this method yieldedsatisfactory results. Waterside strikes also caused trouble and much delayamongst the Allied shipping, and the Naval authorities were eventually ordered to handle the Allied ships waiting for unloading. The continuation of strikes and industrial trouble caused much public irritation, particularly as the Govern-ment has in general shown a singular ineffectiveness in dealing with thesestoppages of important work.For a short period, following changes in the Department of Information, a distinct anti-United Kingdom tone was noticed in the presentation of the newsby the Australian Broadcasting Commission, a fact which caused a certain measure of public disgust.  Recently there has been a considerable improvement.(5) Naval, Military and Air Activities.H.M.A.S. Australia, Canberra and Perth were engaged in escortingtransports in the South-West Pacific; H.M.A.S. Canberra and Hobart alsoescorted transports in the waters between the west coast of Australia and netherlands East Indies. H.M.A.S. Adelaide was employed in escort duty in theTasman Sea.Five mine-sweepers were commissioned and one mine-sweeper launched forthe Royal Australian Navy.The 27th Australian Infantry Brigade came into action in Malaya towardsthe middle of the month; the 22nd Australian Infantry Brigade was in action[23493] b 2placed under strict control with a view to reducing civil consumption by 50 percent. Unauthorised sales of tyres have been prohibited. The rationing of sugarwas instituted with effect from the 25th January. The allowance has been fixed at f lb. per person per week. It has been announced that petrol rationing willbe introduced on the 1st April.
a few days later, and thereafter the whole 8th Division A.I.F. was continuouslyengaged in heavy and bitter fighting.Outlying garrisons of the A.T.F. were also engaged against the Japanese inthe Ocean and Nauru Islands, at Rabaul and in the Solomon Islands.The field army in the Darwin area was strengthened during the month andwill gradually be built up to a total establishment of about 14,000.Armoured regiments of armoured divisions are being organised to operate as light armoured brigades on a carrier basis for home defence until tanks areavailable. .Australian Military Force units are steadily increasing in strength, and covering force units are at their battle stations. There are at present approxi-mately 217,000 Australian Military Force personnel called up on full-time duties,and these numbers are increasing daily.Aircraft of the R.A.A.F. in the Far East attacked enemy shipping in thevicinity of the Celebes and off Eabaul.NEW ZEALAND.(6) General Position.The increasing virulence of the war in the Far East naturally becomes amatter of the gravest concern to New Zealand, particularly as it is felt that new Zealand could fairly easily be attacked if Fiji were to fall to the invader.As the war in the Pacific developed, public anxiety increased, but there has been only a slight tendency in the press to blame the United Kingdom for the variousreverses. There is, however, a growing feeling that insufficient attention hasbeen paid to the Far Eastern theatre of war, and, in view of Russian successes,it is felt that the danger to the United Kingdom has decreased and that morematerial should have been made available for the defence of the South-west pacific. The stream of messages from Australian Ministers, fully reported inthe New Zealand press, has given the impression of great activity on the partof that Dominion and comparative lethargy on the part of the New zealand government.Mr. churchill&apos;s Ottawa speech, and the unification of the Allied command,and the appointment of General Wavell were all warmly welcomed; the appoint-ment of General Wavell being particularly popular. There has been no comment on Sir Earle Page&apos;s recommendation for improved liaison with United kingdon departments. The recall of Mr. Duff Cooper without the establishment of any new Allied Council for the Far East was deprecated.In Foreign Affairs Russian and Chinese successes have received continuousfavourable comment.In domestic affairs the chief concern during January has been over the growing crisis with regard to man-power. This was precipitated by the Govern-ment proposal to call up a further 2,700 men, as the shortage of men is beginning to be felt in industry. Labour leaders have agreed to longer hours of work ifsimilar burdens are shouldered by the whole community, but the protractedconferences between Trade Union leaders and the Government on this point donot point to a hopeful outcome. Powers have been taken to control the labour supply in specified industries. It has also been decided to compel service in theAir Raid Precaution Services.(7) Naval, Military and Air Activities.H.M.N.Z. cruisers Achilles and Leander were engaged on escort and convoyduties; the latter escorted ships carrying reinforcements and supplies to Fijiand is now operating with the Australian squadron.Married men without children between the ages of 18 and 45, inclusive, havebeen called up for military service. The second phase of mobilisation of theTerritorial Forces and National Reserve was carried out between the 10th and14th January.Reinforcements for Fiji have arrived safely.United States aircraft are now. operating in the Royal New Zealand AirForce in patrols from Fiji.
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.(8) General Position.In domestic affairs the principal features during the month have been (a) theever-widening rift between the various sections of the Nationalist Opposition,the decrease of Dr. Malan&apos;s authority within the party and the increase in strength of Mr. Pirow&apos;s &quot;New Order,&quot; now a frankly Nationalist party runentirely on Nazi lines of intolerance and racial hatred, and (b) the grave acts of sabotage which have disturbed Union political and industrial life.At the opening of the Parliamentary session Dr. Malan gave notice of a motion calling for the immediate establishment, of a &quot; Christian NationalRepublic &quot; divorced from the Crown and Empire. In the course of the debatewhich followed, the Prime Minister described the motion as &quot; purely academic.&quot;He exposed Dr. Malan&apos;s pretence that the rights of the English-speaking sectionwould be safeguarded.The considerable concern shown by the South African public at the revela-tions of subversive activities by certain sections of the Union Police Force was increased by the grave bomb outrages on the Rand, which have been fullyreported in the United Kingdom press. Emergency regulations have since beenpromulgated (on the 4th February) providing the imposition of the death penalty for acts of sabotage. Dr. Malan stated to his party that these acts only arousedthe repugnance of the great mass of Afrikaners, and had given the Governmentthe opportunity to impose further repressive measures against the Afrikanermovement as a whole.The struggle for power within the Opposition groups has involved areorientation of the various factions, and it looks as though a National Socialistfront may be formed by Mr. Pirow and his &quot; New Order &quot; followers, andMr. Van Rensburg of the Ossewa Brandwag, possibly under the nominal leader-ship of General Hertzog. Mr. Pirow has since introduced a motion for a selectCommittee to enquire into Communist activities in the Union, and it is evidentthat the Pirow Group will play on the genuine dislike of communism by arguing that it can only be countered by National Socialist methods and policy.The Opposition, for instance, has strongly criticised the Government^decision to accept a Soviet Consul.Mr. Havenga, who leads the remnants of General Hertzog&apos;s party, is trying to prevent the imminent split in his party, but shows no sign of changing hisanti-war attitude. There are signs of a desire to bring back Mr. Havenga intothe Government, owing partly to the growing unpopularity of Mr. Hofmeyrinside the United Party, but General Smuts has stood firm against this.In Empire affairs the pro-Government press have shown sympathy withMr. Curtin&apos;s demands for a greater Australian share in the framing of war policy, but some criticism of his methods, and assurance that the Union is satisfied with the present means of consultation. The Opposition press naturally mademuch use of Mr. Curtin&apos;s dissatisfaction, in order to work up feeling againstGeneral Smuts for sending South African forces out of the Union withoutdemanding a quid pro quo in the way of increased influence on war policy.The Alliedwar arrangements have given satisfaction, and Mr. Churchill&apos;sOttawa and Washington speeches were fully and enthusiastically reported.Emphasis was laid on the long-term importance of United States help, and thepresent importance of Russian victories. The Opposition press, on the otherhand, continued to emphasise the gravity of the Far Eastern situation, and has given much prominence to South African losses in Libya. A new propagandaline taken by the Opposition has been to point out that, whatever the outcome ofthe war, the centre of gravity of the English-speaking world will shift from theUnited Kingdom to the United States of America, and that South Africa mustbe able to stand alone, and not be &apos;: dominated &apos;&apos; by anybody.(9) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Troops of the 1st and 2nd South African Divisions were engaged in thefrontier area of Libya during the month. In conjunction with British tankunits, they captured Bardia by night attack on the 1st January with very slightcasualties, taking nearly 8,000 prisoners and releasing 1,150 British prisoners.
Sollum surrendered to South African troops on the 12th. when seven officers and275 other ranks were captured, and Half aya surrendered unconditionally on the morning of the 17th with 5,500 prisoners. During these two latter operationsSouth African casualties were again extremely light. South African armoured cars were also operating in the forward area. Subsequent to General Rommel1 scounter-attack and advance from the Agheila position to the area west of Gazala,the 1st South African Division moved up on the 28th January to theEl Adem(10) Economic Activities.A scheme of petrol rationing was introduced on the 1st February which it isestimated will effect a 25 per cent, reduction in consumption. Measures taken to economise in the use of rubber include the prohibition of sales of tyres and tubespending the introduction of rationing.(11) NEWFOUNDLAND.There have been no recent arrivals of military or naval recruits from newfoundland, but it is estimated that since the outbreak of the war nearly10,000 Newfoundlanders have left Newfoundland on various forms of war service, including those in the Merchant Navy and the Forestry Unit. this represents nearly a quarter of the male population between the ages of 20 and 40.The latest returns indicated that at the end of 1941 there were no able-bodiedmen in the Island requiring relief.The Newfoundland Government have announced that they propose to take steps to institute a system of free and compulsory education in the Island. Thiswill be an important stage in the reforms achieved since the establishment of theCommission of Government.(12) EIRE.The food situation in Eire has been causing anxiety to the Eire Government.On the 7th January Mr. Lemass stated that in all probability it would benecessary shortly to ration bread. Later, in appealing to the farmers to releaseat once all the wheat they can possibly spare, he said that, if this should happen to a sufficient extent, the rationing of bread might possibly be averted. He alsoannounced that ration books were being prepared so that they could be available at short notice should conditions show that rationing should be applied quicklyto other commodities. On the 10th January Mr. Lemass and Dr. Ryan bothspoke on the shortage of wheat, tacitly implying that the farmers were with-holding supplies. Mr. Lemass said that a wheat deficiency in Eire was inevitablethis year, and that, even after allowing for increased imports and possibly latedeliveries from the Irish farmers, there would still not be sufficient wheat.As to the supply position generally, Mr. Lemass said it was not as bad as last year because they now had a number of ships. He denied that he had saidat any time that they were being blockaded by Britain. He did not attribute anymotive to the British Government. No doubt the British Government were taking urgent necessary steps to safeguard their own supplies, &apos;&apos; but when aBritish Government Department made an Order prohibiting the export of goods to this country, that action was taken by design. Up to then there had been ageneral export licence for exports to Ireland, but this had been cancelled.&quot;Dr. Ryan, speaking in Mullingar on the same day, appealed to every farmerto look carefully into his stocks of grain and to deliver any surplus as soon aspossible to authorised buyers. &quot; I would appeal to him to put every additionalacre he can under the plough in the coming year; to sow kail the wheat he can atonce, and when the Spring comes to sow more wheat, more potatoes and morebarley and oats. The farmer&apos;s duty is to see that we have all the food we require.&quot;Speaking at Navan on the 12th January, Mr. de Valera referred at length toattacks on Eire in what he called the &quot; foreign press.&quot; He said : &quot;I know ofthe attacks upon this country. Now. we have no need to excuse ourselves-, toanybody. What we are doing is our God-given right to do. We have laid downour policy very clearly from the beginning, and that is that we intend not to enterinto this war if we can possibly avoid it, and we will avoid it, please God, unless
we are attacked. If we are attacked, we have to take it as God&apos;s will and sellour lives, if we have to sell them, as dearly as we can.&quot;The earliest intimation of Mr. de Valera&apos;s attitude to the landing of american troops in Northern Ireland came in the form of a statement issuedthrough the Information Bureau on the 27th January, in which he raised theissue of partition. Mr. de Valera complained that he had not been consultedeither by the British Government or the United States Government in regard tothe coming of the American troops to the Six Counties. He said : &quot; It is our duty to make it clearly understood that, no matter what troops occupy the six counties, the Irish people&apos;s claim for the union of the whole of the nationalterritory and for supreme jurisdiction over it will remain unabated &quot;Exports for 1941 were  31,835,599 as against  32,973,772 in 1940 imports were  29 536,674 as against  46.790,207. &apos;As from the 26th January cattle could be exported to Northern Ireland from eire without an Export Permit. The ban on the export of store cattle to britain was also removed as from the same day.&apos;  INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.(13) Political Situation.1. There was no significant change during the month. The All-india congress Committee met in the middle of January and confirmed the resolution passed by the Working Committee at the end of December. None of thepronouncements made by Congress leaders during the month revealed any sign of genuine readiness to co-operate with the present Administration. The Congressdemand continued to be for complete independence, in the absence of whichCongress appears unwilling even to resume the responsibilities of government inthe Provinces. Meanwhile, there has been no apparent change in the attitudeof the Moslem League, who profess willingness to co-operate in the defence ofthe country either singly or with other parties, but in the latter case on terms which would be Wholly unacceptable to Hindus. An appeal sent to the PrimeMinister when at Washington by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and twelve other representatives of &quot; moderate &quot; opinion, calling for complete Indianisation ofthe Governor-General&apos;s Council and other measures for the enhancement ofIndia&apos;s external status, internationally and within the Commonwealth, arousedsome public interest, though none of the leading Indian parties has given it anysupport. The Prime Minister&apos;s reply was still under consideration at the endof the month.2. The course of the war in the Far East is being followed with increasedanxiety. Exaggerated fears for the safety of India&apos;s eastern coast have drivenmany thousands of people from Calcutta and other cities; fantastic rumours havebeen current; the weakness of the Far Eastern defences, especially in Malaya, hasshaken confidence; and the arrival of Indian refugees from Burma and beyondhas shocked the complaisance built up by generations of security. But the danger is reported to have done some good in bringing home the urgent need of prepara-tion against attack, and has quickened a desire to assist in A.R.P. and civil defence; and it is felt that where symptoms of defeatism have appeared they arelikely to be allayed when the Allies can check and hold the Japanese assault.(14) Indian States.It is reported that general apprehension, sometimes amounting to pessimism,has been prevalent since the entry of Japan into the war. State governments have, however, taken action to steady opinion. There has been some labourunrest, but not on a serious scale.(15) Foreign and Frontier Relations.1. Afghanistan. At an interview with the Prime Minister on the15th January, when the atmosphere was not altogether satisfactory, HisMajesty&apos;s Minister discussed the question of material assistance to Afghanistan,
of which he had given a hint during the negotiations for the removal of the AxisNationals. The Prime Minister explained that the Cabinet felt that the offerhad come too soon after the expulsion of the Axis Nationals for them to be ableto accept it, lest they be accused of receiving a previously arranged consideration.What they would like, however, was a &apos;&apos; credit &apos;&apos; of unspecified amount against which they could purchase arms. The Prime Minister went on to take the line that if the aggrieved public in Afghanistan was to be prevented from criticisingthe&apos;Government of India, both the Afghan Government and people must getwhat they want in the way of assistance instead of which at present everydifficulty was being placed in their way. Sir Francis Wylie pointed out that this statement was quite unfounded, and the Government of India had in fact onlyrefused export licences for goods destined for Afghanistan in very few cases.In the case of petrol supplies, moreover, they had only asked the AfghanGovernment to accept the same reduction as they had imposed on their own public. He promised, however, to report what the Prime Minister had said tohis Government, and, as the question of the supply of certain classes of goods to afghanistan might very shortly assume an acute form, he would ascertain theviews of the Government of India in the matter during his forthcoming visit toDelhi. This question will have to be further considered in the light of theGovernment of India&apos;s views after discussion with Sir F. Wylie, but it is unlikelyin any case that arms could be made available in present circumstances. It is ofsome interest in this connection that the Prime Minister has requested AbdulMajid. the Commerce Minister, to return to Kabul from Switzerland, where hehas been since his operation.Major Gordon Enders, the newly-appointed United States Military Attache,has been in Kabul since early in December, but his position has been difficultbecause the Afghans have questioned his status, and the Foreign Minister hastold him that he should be considered as a guest only until the appointment ofa United States Minister to Kabul. The Prime Minister has refused him an interview, and he is not allowed cypher facilities. It appears that the UnitedStates Government had been considering appointing a Minister Resident inKabul, but the Afghan Government are not content with this, and are holding-out for a Minister Plenipotentiary. Sir F. Wylie considers that the appointmentof a United States Minister to Kabul would be a great advantage from our pointof view, and would enormously strengthen the Allied diplomatic front there.2. North-West Frontier. The frontier has remained generally quiet.There has been a certain amount of hostile activity in tribal areas, though thiswas kept in check during part of the month by exceptionally severe weather.The Frontier Constabulary had a brush with a strong gang in the AhmadzaiSalient on the 5th January and caused some casualties, and on the 24th Januarypart of a gang of hostiles was surrounded in Kurram Garhi village and lost12 killed and 5 captured. South Waziristan Scouts surprised and engaged agang which had been looting Agency convoy lorries. Five hostiles were capturedand most of the looted property recovered. In North Waziristan a reconnaissanceparty, including the Resident and the District Commander, which was visitingthe Khaisora Valley in connection with defence works, were forced to turn backby hostiles with some casualties. This attack was, however, resented by theTori Khel, who, next day, invited the party to Biche Kashkai, picketing the routein force and displaying the greatest goodwill. The Resident and other officers have since toured extensively under tribal protection and have been well received.- The frontier tribes&apos; sentiment towards the Japanese is hostile. They are regarded as a debased kind of Hindu, and are blamed for increasing the dearthof cheap goods.3. Nepal. The Maharaja has expressed a desire to retire some time in theautumn of this year. In view of the value to us of Nepalese assistance and thewhole-hearted support which has been given by the Maharaja, the Viceroy iswriting personally to him to urge him to defer his retirement for the time being and if possible until the end of the year.(16) Economic., Nothing to report.
(17) Finance.Nothing to report.(18) Military Activities.1. The Command of Burma passed to the Commander-in-Chief, South-west pacific, on the 10th January. ^The Command of Iraq and Iran passed to the Commander-in-Chief, middle east, on the 12th January.2.   The following reinforcements have been despatched to Malaya :    &apos;100 Light Tank Squadron.5 Light A.A. Battery.44 Indian Infantry Brigade.45 Indian Infantry Brigade.2,100 Infantry reinforcements.3.   The following reinforcements have been despatched to Burma:  Headquarters 17 Indian Division.2 W. Yorks. Regiment.46 Indian Infantry Brigade (1.7 Division).48 Indian Infantry Brigade (19 Division).28 Squadron, R.AP.1 Squadron, I.A.F.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.(19) Military.During January the Japanese progressively occupied the Tenasserim Coast,and at the end of. the month our forces had withdrawn to the West of theSalween River. Tavoy was evacuated about the 20th January and Mergui somedays later. Moulmein was evacuated on the 31st. The Japanese had superiority in numbers and air strength. They also seem to be more skilful at jungle warfarethan our troops, and there is evidence that in Southern Tenasserim they havebeen aided by a &quot;Fifth Column&quot; in Burma in the shape of the Thakins, apolitical organisation of revolutionary tendencies, who are reported to have led the Japanese around our forces at Tavoy and to have assisted them by creatingdisturbances within the town.Efforts were made to remove tin, wolfram and rubber stocks from Tavoy,but much material of economic, value has fallen into enemy, hands. Furthermore,the loss of Tavoy and Moulmein provides the Japanese with two more aerodromes and greatly weakens the effectiveness of the Rangoon Air Raid Warning system.In Mergui demolitions and denials were carried out by the army.About the 23rd January two ships were sunk by enemy submarine off Bassein.During the month the war in the air was continued with marked success bythe combined R.A.F. and American Volunteer Group Pilots. Continuous raids were made against Rangoon, being directed principally .at the aerodrome atMingaladon. Two particularly heavy raids were made on the 23rd and24th January. Of 70 bombers wnich took part in the first raid, 19 were certainlydestroyed with 7 probables for the loss of two Allied aircraft with one pilot safe.On the 24th January 7 Japanese bombers operated with an escort of 20 to 30fighters; all 7 bombers were destroyed with 3 fighters certain and 3 probable andno loss to&apos;the Allies. By the end of January the Allied Air Forces had certainlyaccounted for over 100 enemy aircraft. Hardly any damage was done to Rangoonitself, though some was inflicted on Mingaladon aerodrome.The Land Forces in Burma were reinforced by two Indian Brigades, thesecond of which arrived safely in convoy from India on the 30th January. Theywere also reinforced by the Fifth and Sixth Chinese Armies which are moving[23493] c  .    .
into the Shan States. The R.A.F. were reinforced by some Hurricanes andBlenheims, and by two Army Co-operation Squadrons from India, but theauthorities in Burma were dismayed by the threat that the A.V.G. would be withdrawn to China, which would have left them at the end of the month, asfar as offensive planes were concerned, with six Hurricanes, four Buffaloes and six Blenheims. This question was taken up through the joint Chiefs of Staff in washington, and it was hoped that the A.V.G. will not be withdrawn:(20) Internal.The arrest of U Saw caused surprisingly little unrest. A new ministry was formed under Sir Paw Tun, the former Acting Premier, and all the other ministers of IT Saw&apos;s Government have remained in Office. Sir Paw Tun isco-operating loyally and energetically with the Governor, and in general theMinistry&apos;s conduct is satisfactory, though one or two of the Ministers who werepolitical supporters of IT Saw are suspected to be not free of his leanings towardsJapan-or rather, perhaps, to the victor if that should prove to be Japan. Withthe continued success of the Japanese there was some tendency towards a morepro-Saw move towards the end of the month, but this does not appear to be serious. The Governor is taking strong measures against the Thakins, whosedisloyalty was mentioned above, and at the end of the month the Home Ministerproscribed the whole party.At the beginning of the month the labour situation improved for a period,but there was a fresh exodus on the 13th January, when between 5,000 and 10,000Indians left Rangoon by road apparently because of a rumour. Steps were takento deal with this, however, and by the end of the month the labour situation had greatly improved. Arrangements were made for a Chinese Labour Corps, ofwhich the first batch arrived on the 22nd January. This meant that there wereavailable in the Docks about 4,000 workers, including military, convicts andreliable Chinese, who would be available whatever happened. On the advice ofhis Ministers the Governor promulgated on the 29th January the Labour and wages Ordinance, making provision for the prevention of strikes and for the setting-up of a Board to deal with questions of wages and labour conditions. TheGovernor commented on this that, for the first time, Rangoon labour would havea chance to get a square deal, and that, if the Board worked well and quickly,they should be able to do more to retain labour at work than any amount ofcoercion. ,(21) External and Economic.The Rice Control Scheme is now in full operation, and information has beenreceived that the Government is buying paddy through the&apos; medium of localmerchants.Attention is being given to the development of wolfram production fromareas in the centre of Burma which so far have been unexploited.Previous estimates of an early cotton crop of 55.000 bales and a late crop of15,000 bales were confirmed. Most of the early crop has been purchased by theGovernment, but it has succeeded in selling only 9 000 bales, and, unless furtherquantities can be sold to the United Kingdom, 50.000 to 60,000 bales of a valueof Rs. 40 lakhs are likely to be left on Burma&apos;s hands.Owing to the needs of the Government for railway and river transport forwar purposes, the volume of China traffic is likely to decrease until the militarysituation is clearer. For the same reason the Governor was doubtful whetherwork should be continued on the Burma-Yunnan Railway, and suggested that all available resources might be directed towards maintaining and improvingcommunications in Burma and constructing a land-link with India. It has,however, been decided that work on the Burma-Yunnan Railway should not be discontinued, and that, at the same time, communication between Burma andIndia, probably by road only, should be established as soon as possible. Work onthis road from the Indian end has already begun.Complete reports for traffic on the Burma Road for the month of Januaryare not available; but statistics received for the first two weeks show that tonnagepassing over the Burma-Yunnan Border was well up to recent levels.
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note.--In this report &quot; Colonies&quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.(22) Supplies to the Colonies.Steel.The prospect of obtaining supplies of steel for the Colonies from the UnitedStates under Lease-Lend has now improved) as the American authorities have accepted a blanket requisition for the supply of 10,000 tons a month for therequirements of all Colonies except Malaya, which is being treated separately.This is expected, to cover all Colonial requirements from the United States whichare likely to meet the high standards of essentiality to the war effort necessaryto render them eligible for Lease-Lend supply. It does not render possible any relaxation in the general policy of restricting supplies to the Colonies to thoseabsolutely necessary for war purposes.Cotton.Partly as a result of the very small quantity of raw cotton which theProduction Executive has felt able to allocate for United Kingdom exportsoverseas, grave anxiety is felt as to the cotton piece-goods situation in the colonial empire. Arrangements are in hand for the available exports of India and theUnited Kingdom to be equitably distributed amongst the various consumingEmpire countries, but, eA^en so, with the disappearance of Japan as a source ofsupply and other factors, the maximum that can be hoped is that Colonies willbe able to import about 50 per cent, of their normal requirements; and this may prove to be an over-optimistic estimate. Particular anxiety is felt over theposition in West Africa, as cotton piece-goods there are not only needed as essential articles of apparel, but are required, as objects upon which the West-African producer can spend his purchasing power. It is feared that, if noconsumption goods are available for the African producer to buy, he may refuseto work for money which he cannot spend, and this would be particularly unfortunate at the present time when we are relying to so large an extent onWest Africa for oil-seeds. The whole question is being discussed with the otherDepartments concerned.(23) Production in the Colonies.Rubber and Tin.Vigorous action is being taken to reach the maximum possible productionof rubber and tin in Colonial territories outside Malaya in view of the events in the Far East. Various practical measures to assist production are underdiscussion with the Ministry of Supply.Sisal.An agreement has been signed for the purchase of 23,000 tons from BritishEast Africa by the United States for a stock pile, and discussions are proceeding with regard to the equitable sharing of available supplies.Oil-seeds.Negotiations are proceeding between the High Commissioner for the western pacific and the Canadian Government regarding the sale of the whole outputof that area to Canada. It is proposed that the Canadian Government shouldbe the sole buyer, and that if urgent needs arise for supply to the United States(of which there are some indications) or to the United Kingdom itself, those needsshould be met by arrangement with the Canadian Government.With growing jeopardy to Netherlands East Indies supplies of copra, itis proposed that the East African output should be shared by the Ministry ofFood and the Middle East area, under arrangements still under discussion.[23493] d
%Graphite.Negotiations with Ceylon have not reached a conclusion owing, in the main,to the extortionate price demands of the (Sinhalese) producers and, in part, toshort-sighted buying and the inflated current prices by United States privatebuyers.West African Products.Events in the Far East and other developments have greatly increaseddependence on West African sources of supply of, e.g., oil-seeds and certainminerals. Close attention is being paid to the co-ordination of policy necessaryto secure maximum production there, including the maintenance of supplies of imported goods used in production or necessary for the consumption of labourersand the organisation of adequate resources in both European and Africanpersonnel.(24) Financial.Currency Hong Kong.It was arranged that Hong Kong notes should be. encashed in unoccupiedChina up to the 31st January, but not after that date.War Risk Insurance and War Damage Malaya.Strong representations have been made by interests connected with the malayan rubber and other industries regarding the exclusion from cover underthe local Commodity War Risk Insurance scheme of the risk of loss by seizureas a&apos;result of enemy occupation. This and connected problems of compensationfor damage to and loss of property raise wide and complex issues which are still under consideration with the interested Departments, including the treasury and the Board of Trade.Defence.- (25) General.(a) Scorched Earth Policy. -Instructions have been sent to all Coloniesdrawing the attention of Governors to the military importance of the denial ofvaluable resources to the enemy in the event of invasion, and requesting themto prepare plans for their Territories in consultation with the local MilitaryAuthorities and representatives of the companies and other interests concerned and to forward reports to the Secretary of State. Detailed guidance has been givenregarding the types of resources and installations which should be denied andthe methods which have been found most effective in planning denial schemes.(b) Anti-gas measures. A circular telegram has been sent to all Coloniesrequesting Governors to telegraph up-to-date statements of the preparationswhich have been made in their Territories against possible gas attack and of thesupply of respirators and protective equipment at present available or on order.It is proposed to review the position generally on receipt of the various repliesand to consider what further measures are required.(26) Far East War.(a) Malaya. The remainder of the Malay States were invaded by theJapanese in the course of January, and on the last day of the month our Forceswithdrew from the Peninsula to Singapore Island. The. causeway connectingthe Island with Johore has been cut. No general attack has yet been made uponthe Island by the Japanese, but there have been constant air raids both by day and night in the course of which many civilians have been killed and injured,the total fatal casualties for January being 1,494.The withdrawal of our Forces down the Peninsula does not appear to havebeen accompanied by any appreciable transfer of the Asiatic population.Normally, on notice from the military authorities, the civil administration havegiven warnings in each area from which withdrawal was about to take place that women and children or men not required for defence services should leave ifthey wished. In general only European women and children left on thiswarning. Most of the Asiatic population preferred to stay or went to up-countryrural areas.
Simultaneously the evacuation of &apos;&apos; useless mouths &apos;&apos; from Singapore hasbeen expedited. By the end of January 7,174 European, 2,305 Indians and460 Chinese had been evacuated. There were difficulties in finding destinationsfor..the Chinese, but the Australian authorities have now agreed to admit 5,000and the Ceylon Government 500. The Netherlands East Indies Government havenot yet agreed to take more than 500. The rate of departure of Chinese seemsalso to have been influenced by the policy of the Chinese Government, which apparently was, at least until recently, opposed to the evacuation. In general,the Asiatic women and children have not been willing to leave without their men,and the destination difficulty has not so far held.up the departure of those whowere willing to leave.The food position in Singapore is reported recently to be satisfactory;rationing of food and water supplies has been introduced.(b) North Borneo and Sarawak. In the course of the month both these territories were occupied by the enemy. Most of the British Officials are nowin Japanese hands, and so far no news of them has been received.The Rajah of Sarawak has established himself with a quorum of the supreme council of Sarawak in Australia, and proposes to conduct any necessary affairs of the Sarawak Government from that base.(c) Western Pacific. There has been no change in the position of the Gilbertand Ellice Islands Colony; there have been further Japanese visitations to theNorthern Gilberts, but so far no permanent occupation appears to have takenplace. Concern has been caused by the position of the population on Ocean island in view of the difficulty of communication and the fact that existing food supplies will be exhausted by the end of March. It is now hoped, however, that theAustralian Government will be able to arrange for the evacuation of the europeans and Chinese and convey further food supplies for the Gilbertese andBanabans (the latter being the indigenous inhabitants).There has been some enemy activity over the British Solomon Islands, mostlyreconnaissance, but at certain points bombs have been dropped. The european population is being evacuated and the Commonwealth Government have beenasked to make similar arrangements for the Chinese.European women and children have been evacuated from Tonga and asimilar scheme is under consideration for the New Hebrides.(d) Hong Kong. -Information on conditions under Japanese occupation arerather conflicting, but recent reports from Macao are disquieting, and suggest a deliberate Japanese policy of humiliating and contemptuous treatment of europeans.(27) Social Services.Health.An inter-departmental Committee on Yellow Fever Control has made anumber of recommendations which are of considerable importance in view of thepresent volume of service and ancillary air traffic across Africa. these recommendations are being brought to the notice of the British and foreignauthorities concerned.Reports on Individual Colonies.(28) West Indies-United States Bases.Contrary to expectation, there were no incidents between the American forces and the civil population in Antigua during Christmas and the NeW Year. Thesituation in this Presidency seems to have improved&quot;.(29) Palestine.Public interest during the past month has tended once again to concentratemore on the cost of living and the supply situation than on purely military aspects of the war. The institution of municipal courts for food control offenceshas been widely welcomed as a practical step to protect the public.
The death of Pinhas Rutenburg on the 3rd January deprived the jewish community of an outstanding figure. He had tirelessly striven to influence his people to place the war effort above politics and to moderation- and unity in internal affairs.  His untimely death is a great loss to Palestine.The criminal activities of a Jewish pseudo-political terrorist gang knownas the Stern Group has disturbed and unsettled the Jewish urban communities in Palestine. Its activities during the month included two robberies, oneaccompanied by murder, and the carefully planned murder of the officer-in-chargeof the police in Tel Aviv and his principal assistants. The motive.of the robberieswas apparently to replenish the group&apos;s &quot; war-chest,&quot; which finances inter aliaan anti-British broadcasting station. The murder of the police officersapparently had the object of easing the pressure of pursuit of members of thegroup both by eliminating the principals and by intimidating other personnel.
