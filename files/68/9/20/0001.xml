The obstacles in the way of an improvement in our economic re-Spain have now been removed      These were the suspension of petroleum shipments from the U.S. and the uncertainty as to the possibility of meeting Spanishdemands for rubber      Tne Americans have arranged a temporary programme of oilshipments and the Combined Raw Materials Board have agreed to the release of2,000 tons of rubber in quarterly instalments.As a result we have been promised 300 tons of wolfram before the end ofJune, export licences for our pre-emptive purchases of woollen manufactures andthe rest of our supply purchase programme,     American representatives have visitedMadrid to concert plans with our representatives and the Reconstruction finance corporation will be permanently represented in Madrid.     It is -oroposed that tLcost of pre-emption shall be shared and the Americans will workou?1neir^ownsupply purchase programme tc cover the period up to the end of June, after whichthere will probably be a common programme. 5 nionPORTUGAL.Economic relations with Portugal are passing through a most difficult phase,partly because of the wolfram situation and partly because world shortages ofcertain goods, shipping difficulties and the inflationary movement caused by thewolfram situation have brought it home to the Portuguese that neutrality does not mean immunity from the effects of war.     Colonel Fernandez, Economic Adviser tothe Portuguese Ministry of -Foreign Affairs, has visited London to negotiate andhis visit disclosed certain fundamental differences of opinion, in particularregarding the export of indigenous produce similar to goods imported throughthe blockade, and the Portuguese claim that imports from their Atlantic islandsshould be outside the scope of the ration and navicert system.     The one concreteresult of the discussions with Colonel Fernandez was a declaration by thePortuguese that, in accordance with our desire, they would no longer permit there-export of &quot;pre-blockade11 stocks.SWITZERLAND.Swiss Trade Delegation has arrived in this country to negotiate.     the swiss have indicated that they have reason to believe that the enemy would agreeto exports of priority materials to the Allies to the value of some 2* millionSwiss Francs per month if we in return will guarantee the supply of certain specific raw materials to an equivalent value and will re-open the Swiss rationsfor industrial raw materials.     This offer has been adopted aa a basis iornegotiation.m FRENCH NORTH AFRICA.The Vichy Government are in active negotiation with the U.S. Government andhave already given certain assurances which will probably Justify the sailingof two ships from New York in the near future.     Only the single voyage would,he approved and the sailing of those ships would not necessarily mply the re-sumption of the full North African traffic.TURKEY.Subject to the consent of the Turkish Government, their requirements, bothcivil and military will, in future, be notified to a Co-Ordinating committee attogora, on which the U.3. will be represented.     The Committee will not itselfdecide the applications submitted to it but will pass them on to London orWashington with its recommendations.m    There have been developments in the proposed U.S. pre-emption programme inT*key.    Tho u.S. authorities contemplate an extension of their present purchas-lng Programme and also a lonr-term policy to counter the advantages Germany nasgamed by her long-term commitments.     While insisting that all decisions aboutJ&apos;S. participation must be taken in Washington the U.S. authorities have agreedthat discussions about the Turkish programme shall take place in London.RELIEF/
