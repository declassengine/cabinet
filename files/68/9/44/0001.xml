The Portuguese counter proposals to the supply-purchase programme have nowbeen received.     They are in the main reasonable, but some of the increases askedfor in iron and steel manufactures and sulphate of ammonia are impracticable on supply grounds.We finally agreed to the signature of the sardine contract as Dr. Salazarhas given a verbal assurance that even if the supply-purchase programme were to&quot;break down this contract would bo implemented.     Wo have since heard that after our decision was notified to the Portuguese Government a now allocation wasmade to the Germans which will involve reductions in the quotas for the U.K.and U.S.     H.M. Ambassador at Lisbon is boing instructed to protest.FRENCH NORTH africa the cargoes of the next two ships to sail from the U. S. to North Africahave been approved and will consist mainly of sugar, cotton textiles, clothing and green tea.     A full tanker of kerosene has also been approved.turkey in spite of assurances that no chrome would bo supplied to Germany unlessGerman obligations under the Clodius Agreement were fulfilled, it appears almost certain that as part of the German-Turkish arms agreement now under negotiationthe Turks intend to supply chrome to the Germans in 1943 and 1944 and that someof this chrome will be drawn from stocks outstanding on January 8th which H.M.Government are entitled, and intended, to purchase under the Anglo-Turkishagreement.     H.M. Ambassador at Angora has informed the Turkish Government thatwe intend to exercise our rights and buy up all stocks outstanding on January8th next, and that we are ready to pay for those stocks and for all new chromemined between now and January 8th at the enormously inflated price offered bythe Germans on condition that the Turks will, during 1943-44 supply us withchrome pari passu with the Germans and will reserve for us any chrome over and above the quantities which they have undertaken to supply to the Germans.     Wehave also offered to take the whole Turkish output for three years from January1945 or for the duration of the war and for one year beyond, whichever is the shorter.RELIEFTwo further ships carrying wheat from Canada have arrived at the Piraeus.Three more ships whose departure had been delayed at the request of the SupervisoryCommission have now sailed.The French ship carrying milk and infants&apos; clothing for unoccupied france has reached Marseilles;   her arrival does not seem to have given rise to anypublicity either here or in France.
