WAR CABINET.REPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER 1941 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.(1) General Position.IN spite of the growing probability of war in the Pacific, the Japanese attackon the 7th December came as a great shock to the Canadian public. One of thefirst reactions of the Canadian press to these events was to note with satisfactionthe unifying effect of war on the people of the United States, and to find comfortin the fact that emergence of the United States as a belligerent could not be interpreted even by the most ill-disposed isolationists as being due to Britishmachinations. .mr. churchill&apos;s speech on the 11th December was soberly treated in the press,and public opinion had already been damped down by the news of the loss of the prince of Wales and the Repulse. These losses were the subject of some adversecomment, but criticism was generally restrained. This comment also applies tothe Canadian reaction to the loss of Hong Kong. Indeed, press comment ingeneral on all the quick Japanese gains has been mild in tone. It was felt thatthe despatch of Canadian troops to Hong Kong had been fully justified, and therewas no evidence of any recrimination.The arrival in Washington of the United Kingdom Prime Minister causedmuch excitement throughout Canada, and the news that he would visit Ottawahad an extremely popular reception. The press has naturally been full ofspeculation about the conversations proceeding at Washington; this speculationranged over all aspects of the war. Particular emphasis has been laid on the merits of a unified command, and the need for joint Allied strategy of a far-reaching and far-seeing kind.Mr. Curtin&apos;s article was fully reported in the Canadian press, but editorsappear to have been shy of making anything more than non-committal comment;.With regard to foreign affairs, there is nothing outstanding to report, aspractically the whole of Canadian public interest has been centred on the events in the Pacific. However, there has been a marked public interest in, andadmiration for, the continued Russian successes, and considerable speculation onthe future course of Russo-Japanese relations. The reasons for the presentRussian neutrality vis-a-vis Japan appear to be appreciated. &apos;i[23379] . -..  BPrinted for the War Cabinet.   January 1942.SECRET. ^ Copy ^      ?3W.P.

It was thought that Canadian opinion might have welcomed Admiral Muselier&apos;s coup at St. Pierre and Miquelon, but, in face of the United states attitude of disapproval, the press, somewhat bewildered, showed a distincttendency to sit on the fence. However, the neAvspaper Action Catholique reportedthat &quot; basically, probably everybody is pleased, because these French islands might easily have passed into enemy hands.&quot; This attitude appears to have been general. -.     :In home affairs there has been a continuance of interest in the conscriptionissue, and sections of the press are urging with increasing vigour the necessityfor conscription for overseas service.Mr. Louis St. Laurent has been appointed as Minister of Justice in succession to the late Mr. Lapointe. The new Minister, who has not hitherto been active in politics, is a leading lawyer from Quebec.(2) Naval. Military and Air Activities.The mobilised strength of the Royal Canadian Navy and Reserve forces on 18th December, 1941, was 3,233 officers and 24,185 ratings. 36 officers and354 ratings had been killed on active service.There are 13 Royal Canadian Naval destroyers at present acting as convoy escorts both locally and in the Atlantic; in addition, there are 57 corvettes acting as convoy escorts in the North Atlantic.His Majesty&apos;s Canadian corvette Wind-flower, while on convoy escort duty,was sunk by collision in fog on the 7th December. One officer and 47 of the crew were rescued.The strength of the Canadian Army Overseas on the 12th December, 1941,was 121,140; the strength in Canada of the active army on this date was 122,493.The Headquarters Canadian Corps and 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian divisions were visited on the 8th December by Lieutenant-General B. C. T. Paget,Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces.Lieutenant-General H. D. G. Crerar arrived at Headquarters CanadianCorps on 27th December to take command, in the absence of General McNaughton(sick).During the month Royal Canadian Air Force squadrons have continued totake part in a number of offensive and defensive operations with the RA.F.No. 401 squadron (Spitfires) destroyed a German fighter and damaged 4 otherswithout loss to themselves. No. 405 squadron (Wellingtons) took part in raids onHamburg, Emden, Ostend (twice), Dunkirk (twice), Wilhelmshaven (twice) andLie Havre. All their aircraft returned safely. Notification of the award of theDistinguished Flying Medal to three sergeants of this squadron was received.No. 408 squadron (Hampdens) took part in raids on Cologne, Le Havre and Kieland lost three aircraft. Other R.C.A.F. squadrons have been regularly engagedfh routine operational flying duties, often under very bad weather conditions.21 R.C.A.F. squadrons have now been formed in the United Kingdom;i&apos; -   &apos; &apos;&apos; COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.(3) General Position.i v  All other news during the month was overshadowed by the outbreak of warin the Pacific.   The effect on the public mind appears to have been much akinto the effect on the United Kingdom public of the fall of France.  The Australianreaction to the loss of the two battleships in Malayan waters was, in the firstplace, one of surprise and amazement that these great ships should not have been adequately protected from the air.  From this point onwards the press in, general has attacked the United Kingdom and Australian Defence authorities andSir Earle Page for misleading the public about the situation in the Pacificgenerally, and in Malaya in particular.   Among the remedies which have beensuggested is one that there should be greater unification of strategy; that thereshould be an increase of Australian influence in the higher direction of the war;;kind that military, naval and air co-operation should be more effectively practised.Quick Japanese successes in Malaya had a most disturbing effect in Australia,. and the prevailing tendency has been to throw the blame on the United Kingdom-for complacency and un pre pa redness.   The press has .steadily been building-upa case for blaming the United Kingdom for all that has gone wrong in the far east, and this tendency was strengthened when Mr.  Curtin&apos;s New Year
statement was published. This statement, and the subsequent press comments,,created something of a sensation in Australia, and Mr. Cur tin&apos;s statement&quot; j$\reported to have been resented by the majority of intelligent Australians, who, at.the same time, tend to hope that the United states may be flattered by the&apos;,references to Australians inter-dependence with the United States. The press&quot;;generally supported the demand for a more direct voice in the higher directionof the war.The Rajah of Sarawak, who is at present residing in Sydney, wasprominently featured in all sections of the Australian press when he attacked theUnited Kingdom military and political leadership in the Far East. Anotherindication of public opinion was seen in connexion with the reports of the landing in Portuguese Timor of Australian and Dutch forces, a move which was generally believed to be the result exclusively of Australian and Dutch initiative. ,Until a change of command was made in Libya, even that campaign wassubjected to acid press comment, which tended to stress the slowness of the advance and to accentuate early mistakes.Russian successes have been very well received by all sections of the public^and M. Litvinoffs statement on his arrival in the United States quietened anyapprehensions about the soviet&apos;s policy vis-a-vis Japan. Australians are clearlyhoping that Russia, in view of her Western successes, may be able to assist in theoperations against Japan. -The war in the Pacific had a marked effect upon the Australian domesticscene. Emergency measures were introduced to provide for lighting restrictions,and for the registration of all married men up to 35 and single men up to 45.There is to be a revision of reserved occupations, and a 20 per cent, cut in thepetrol ration as from February. Some evacuation of civilians from the northern and coastal regions has taken place, the natural anxieties of the public havingbeen heightened by the somewhat hysterical tone of a section of the press.Much publicity has been given to the new conscription measures in the UnitedKingdom and, following the outbreak of war in the Pacific, recruiting inAustralia has greatly improved. j(4) Naval and Military Activities.H.M. Australian cruisers and escort vessels were employed in escort duties to transports and ships carrying reinforcements and supplies to various outlyinggarrisons in South-West Pacific.Two minesweepers and a boom defence vessel for ELM. Royal AustralianNavy were commissioned during the month and 2 minesweepers were launched.The numbers borne on the strength of H.M. Royal Australian Navy at the30th November were: Active Service 7,776, Reserve 12,402; total 20,178.The Commonwealth of Australia is now finding garrisons for : Ambon,Koepang, Port Moresby, Rahaul, Solomon Islands, New Hebrides, New Caledonia,in addition to its forces in Malaya.Latest total enlistments in the A.I.F. are 191,034, of which 121,797 are serving overseas or are on their way.Considerable progress has been made in tracing members of the A.I.F. postedas &quot;missing.&quot; On the 21st June, 1941, casualty returns gave: Missing 6,522,Prisoners of War 295, whereas on the 15th November, 1941, they gave : Missing1,487, Prisoners of War 5,096.NEW ZEALAND.(5) General Position.All other events have been overshadowed by the outbreak of war with Japan,which, in spite of the warnings for many months past, has come as a great shock to the New Zealand public. The alarmingly successful demonstration of japanese sea power, and the apparent unreadiness of the United States causedmuch anxious surprise. The news of the United States and British naval lossesled the press to adopt a much less confident tone than was evident at first, theloss of the Prince of Wales and the Repulse being described as &quot; one of the worst[23379] B 2
disasters in British naval history.&quot; The reaction of the public has been to show considerable anxiety regarding the security of New Zealand, which had previously been thought to be secure from anything other than &quot; hit-and-run&quot; raids.Towards the end of the month the press gave prominence to the Rajah of sarawak&apos;s attack on &quot; Singapore incompetents&quot; and to reports from London ofanxiety and anger in the United Kingdom about the campaign in Malaya, whileprominence was given to the view of the Singapore Associated Press correspondentthat Malaya and Australia had been &quot; let down.&quot; But, on the whole, the NewZealand press has taken a more restrained line than the Australian, and therehas been no evidence of panic and only a small and understandable degree ofrecrimination. Mr. Curtin&apos;s statement that Australia looked to the United Statesrather than to the United Kingdom in the Pacific area caused something of asensation in New Zealand. One newspaper commented : &quot; There is no questionof letting Australia or New Zealand go, but Japan has so disturbed the centralgravity, that in 1942 we may suffer a small proportion of the Motherland^ ordeal.Britain has been, and is, the spearhead of Empire defence in Europe, and hasbeen, and is, the backbone of all Empire defence.&quot;Mr. Churchills speech to Congress was warmly praised, and his referenceto programmes for 1943 and 1944 was specially noted.Early in the month the public showed disappointment at the toughness ofGerman resistance in Libya, and sections of the press maintained that the mistakeof underestimating the enemy had again been made. Appreciation was thereforeshown for Mr. ChurdhiH&apos;s review of the Libyan situation, as it had been felt that early reports, particularly those of the B.B.C., had been over-optimistic, and thatthere was really no hope of an early decision. The Russian successes have beenprominently reported, and, whilst there is nothing approaching a press campaign in favour of a Russian declaration of war on Japan, it has been stated that, with russian aid, the war against Japan would be ended in a matter of months.The New Zealand Trade Union application for a general increase in wage rates has had an unfriendly reception, and the Court arbitration award rejecting the application has had a particularly good press from the papers representingthe business interests.The announcement of the exchange of Ministers with the U.S.A. has beena subject of interest and approval. The new New Zealand Minister to washington is Mr. Walter Nash.(6) Naval and Military Activities.H.M. New Zealand cruisers Achilles and Leander were engaged on escortand patrol duties. H.M.N.Z. armed merchant cruiser Monowui completed herrefit at the end of the month.Mobilisation of tJhe territorial forces and national military reserve will becompleted in January.As soon as the reinforcements, at present decided upon, have arrived, therewill be about 8 New Zealand battalions serving in Fiji.In addition to the construction of minesweeping craft, the New ZealandMunitions Industry now manufactures 3-inch mortars, ammunition carriers,universal carriers, hand grenades, small arms ammunition, ammunition cartridgeclips, steel helmets, water bottles and mess tins.   .UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.(7) General Position.i. In South Africa the first reaction to the war with Japan was a realisationthat the danger to the Union sea routes was much increased, and there was anoticeable feeling that even South African isolationists could. no longer allegethat the war was no concern of the Union. The Opposition press neverthelesscontinued to denounce the Government policy of war with Japan. No attempt&apos;was made by any section of the press to minimise the seriousness of the loss of theWo United Kingdom battleships, or of the events in Malaya and in the Pacificin general. In pro-Government circles Mr. Churchill&apos;s speech to the UnitedStates Congress won warm praise, as did also the news of inter-Allied co-operation
at Washington. The Opposition has interpreted Mr. Churchill&apos;s visit to washington as indicating the increased subservience of Britain to the UnitedStates.In foreign affairs, pro-Government opinion has shown much relief over theGerman reverses in Russia, which have been interpreted as the first major defeat of the German army. .    ,v .In internal affairs, the dissensions within the various branches of theNationalist opposition have increased. Dr. Malan rejected General Smuts&apos;s appeal for national unity, and stated that the Japanese bogy would not movehis party from opposition, claiming that Russia was a greater danger to theUnion. The Opposition press took the line that Nationalists would in no circumstances follow the line of the United States Isolationists and support theGovernment. They gave much prominence to the Australian dissatisfaction withthe Far Eastern position.No progress has been made in the negotiations between Drs. Malan andVan Rensburg for the formation of a united National Committee. Dr. Malanwrote to Van Rensburg saying that South Africa&apos;s most critical hour might beat hand, and if the Nationalist force were divided &apos;&apos; nothing except disaster and perhaps total ruin could be expected.&quot; Van Rensburg replied coolly to thisoutburst, and refused Dr. Malan&apos;s invitation to establish contact with the new order Group. Subsequently all attempts at negotiations and agreement broke down, and the various groups are now at loggerheads with one another. one member of the Afrikander (Hertzog) Party has resigned from that party andhas joined the Government party.   It is expected that others will follow.o: (8) Naval, Military anal Air Activities.The strength of the Union forces on full time service at the end of the year was 11,642 officers and 118,799 other ranks.;, . The 1st South African Division, less the 5th Brigade reforming at MatruhVwas still in the forward area of Cyrenaica at the beginning of the month and took part in the capture of El Adem. ;The 2nd South African Division took over the Halfaya-Capuzzo area on the5th December. Troops of this Division occupied Bir Ghirba on the 11th and captured the Omars a few days later. On the 31st the 2nd Division started itsattack on Bardia, which was captured early on the 2nd January.South African armoured car units were actively engaged throughout themonth in mobile columns and long distance patrols; one regiment formed partof the force which captured Jalo and later moved on to join up with our forcesin the Jedabya area.The latest strength of the South African Air Force is given as 3,177 officers,and 23,477 other ranks; there are also 695 officers and 8,932 other ranks serving with the R.A.F.(9) NEWFOUNDLAND.The seizure of St. Pierre and Miquelon by the Free French has been welcomedin the Newfoundland press and the view strongly expressed that the islandsshould not be returned to the control of the Vichy Government.Arising out of the discussions regarding the question of the command of theland forces in the Colonial Dependencies in which United States bases are being-established, the Newfoundland Government have indicated that they regard it as important to secure the appointment of a Canadian Officer to command the land forces in Newfoundland. Mr. Mackenzie King subsequently informed the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in Canada that the Canadian Government were making arrangements for: a Canadian Officer of rank adequate to be Commander-in-Chief in Newfoundland; to proceed there.Newfoundland exports for the financial year ended the 30th June lastexceeded 36 million dollars, this being the second highest figure on record.(10) SOUTHERN RHODESIA. ;The latest strength return at the 25th October, 1941, of the total militaryforces serving inside the borders of the colony, gave officers 215, other ranks 2,688.
(11) EIRE.The question of recruitment for the Eire Army and the Local Defence force was still prominent during the last month. On the 3rd December Mr. de Valerainformed the Dail that it was not proposed to introduce conscription in Eire.The response for volunteers for the Defence Force had not been unsatisfactory,but there was still a number of physically suitable men who had refrained fromoffering their services.In reply to the discussion of Eire&apos;s position which has arisen in the American&apos;press following upon the United States entry into the war, Mr. de Valerareaffirmed on the 14th December Eire&apos;s policy of neutrality. After emphasisingEire&apos;s. close contacts with and friendly feeling for the United States, he said :&quot;. We can only be a friendly neutral. From the moment this war began there,&apos;was for this State only one policy possible neutrality. Our circumstances, ourhistory, the incompleteness of our national freedom from the partition of our country, made any other policy impracticable. Any other policy would havedivided our people, and for a divided nation to fling itself into war would beto commit suicide.&quot;At a party meeting in Dublin on the 12th December Mr. Lemass utteredgrave warnings on Eire&apos;s supply problem. He referred to the steps taken to getemployers not to dismiss their workers, even if they had not full employment forthem, but added that it must be clear that the policy of keeping as many workers1in employment for as long as possible had an adverse effect on prices. It meant that production costs would be higher than they otherwise would be. Eire had;now reached a position so serious that they must rely entirely on the farmers to produce enough wheat next year or a shortage of flour would be inevitable.The possible course of the war or its effects on the availability of Americansupplies of the goods bought there this year was very uncertain.In answer to a question in the Dail, Mr. Lemass said that a census of thepopulation had been taken with a view to the introduction of a national schemeof rationing, should such a course be necessary. He appreciated that it wouldtie contrary to the public interest to publish in advance any indication of whatcommodities would be rationed. :The steamship Irish Point, one of the vessels which was recently acquired by Irish Shipping, Limited, arrived at Dublin on the 11th December with7,000 tons of wheat.On Christmas Eve Mr. de Valera made his usual broadcast to the UnitedStates. The speech was little more than a reiteration of Eire&apos;s determination to remain neutral. He said : &quot;I have to remember that I am speaking from a neutral country to a people actually engaged in the war, and I can no longerspeak as freely as before. You who know Ireland will not need to be told thather path is bound up with the maintenance of the present policy of theGovernment. To-day we are a people united as perhaps never before in ourhistory. Unless we are attacked any change from neutrality would destroy thisunity.&apos; It is our duty to Ireland to try to keep out of this war, and with God&apos;shelp we hope to succeed. If we are attacked our people and our friendseverywhere in the world will already have known of our determination to resist,and that to the utmost of our power. By voluntary recruitment we quickly built up a considerable defence force, which, though we would wish it better armedjjis now capable of making any attack on us a costly adventure.&apos;&apos;INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.(12) Political Situation.1. The decision to release the Civil Disobedience Prisoners was announced on the 4th December. Mr. Gandhi&apos;s comment was that &quot; so far as I am concerned)the Government of India&apos;s decision cannot evoke a single responsive orappreciative chord in me.&quot; Nehru, who was released on the 5th December, soonissued various statements of which the following is typical: &quot; If asked with whommy sympathies lay in this war I would&quot; nnhesitatingly say with Russia, China,America and England.   But despite my sympathy for the group there is no
question of me going to help Britain.&quot; The more moderate leaders, such asKajagopalachari, spoke in terms of the possibility of giving aid in the warprovided the Government of India is fully transferred at once to a provisionalform of National Coalition Government. A meeting of the Working Committeetook place in the last week of the year. The Moslem League Working Committeeand the National Liberal Federation also met in the same week. Despite theJapanese entry into the war immediately before these meetings, they were mainly concerned with domestic issues, and Indian political opinion generally seems tohave taken this development calmly.2. The CongTess Meeting ended in a compromise between Gandhi, Nehru,and the moderates. Non-violence as a creed was formally dropped but mr. Gandhi is at liberty to continue his non-violent campaign, including CivilDisobedience. Congressmen in case of air raids must avoid conflict with theauthorities, but must work in their own organisations. As regards the war as ;a.whole, Congress reaffirms its previous attitude. It sympathises with the peoplesfighting for freedom, but cannot help Britain so long as India herself is notfree.&quot;   The release of political prisoners &quot; has no significance or importance.&quot;3. The Moslem League reaffirmed its readiness to &quot; shoulder the burden bfdefence&quot; if given a real share in the Government; warned Britain that any departure from the declaration of August 1940, with the object of appeasingCongress, would be a breach of faith with the Moslems; and added that any declaration &apos;&apos; affecting the Pakistan demand or proceeding on the basis of india as one single unit and Moslems as an All-India minority would be resisted byMoslems with all the force at their command,&quot; even if it meant impeding the war effort.4. The National Liberal Federation called on Government to rally Indiaagainst imminent danger by creating a new atmosphere, and reaffirmed the policyof the Bombay Conference of March 1941, viz., a completely Indianised ExecutiveCouncil functioning as a Dominion Government, a firm promise of completeDominion status two years after the war ends, an Indian Defence Member andIndianisation in all grades of all branches of the Defence forces.5. The Hindu Mahasabha had also arranged a meeting for the last week of&apos; the year, but fell foul of the Governor of Bihar, who objected to the place and date arranged, as it would immediately precede the Muslim Id celebrations and cause communal trouble. Mr. Savarkar refused to alter his arrangements and both he and his fellow-leaders were arrested : there was considerable excitementfor a time but no serious trouble. The Mahasabha issued their resolutions to thepress reaffirming their policy of organising Hindus on a military basis to ensuretheir own protection.It will be observed that the attitudes of the various political bodies remainunyielding and mutually antagonistic.6. The Assam Ministry lost its majority during the month, and afterunsuccessful attempts to find a stable Ministry the Governor was compelled on christmas Day to assume the government of the province under Section 93 of theAct.  He hoped this would only be temporary.7.   The Bengal Ministry has suffered for some time from internal dissensionsamong the Moslem Ministers.   It finally resigned early in the month and wasreconstructed by the Premier, Fazl Huq, who quarrelled with Jinnah and the moslem League in the process, but managed to secure a Coalition with hopes ofmaintaining a majority.(13) Indian States.Condemnation of the Japanese aggression has been universal. There hasbeen no panic, though reactions have varied from enthusiasm for A.R.P. work in western India to consternation in certain Eastern States.-  - (14) Military Activities.1. The Commander-in-Chief in India assumed command of all our forces in-Burma on the 15th December. The 16th Indian Infantry Brigade Group arrived-in Burma.  - - ; &apos; . .     --
s2. The Divisional Reconnaissance Regiments for the 6th, 8th andXOth Indian Divisions arrived in Iraq. The 1st Armoured Brigade in Iraq isnow complete in units. The 1st Bn. South Wales Borderers and 1st Bn. duke of Cornwall&apos;s Light Infantry arrived in Iraq from India to be incorporated in10th Indian Division. Three British Battalions from Middle East wereincorporated in 8th Indian Division in Iraq.3. 45th Indian Infantry Brigade Group of 17th Indian Division sailed from india for Malaya. .;(15) Foreign and Frontier Relations.1. Afghanistan. There is little to report from Afghanistan during thelast month, but reports from Herat, Farah and Kandahar Provinces indicate thatthe proceedings of the Loe Jirga have enhanced the prestige of the ruling family.The Queen Mother died on the 13th December and an appropriate message ofcondolence was sent from His Majesty.2. North-West Frontier Province. The frontier generally has been quiet.The Faqir of Ipi has remained at Gorwekt, where he is said to be collectingsupplies and planning operations for next month. A Mahsud Jirga presented the Governor of the North-West Frontier Province with 21,000 rupees towardsthe purchase of aeroplanes, and assured him of their loyalty in the war. the governors announcement that Afridis will be enlisted in the Army has givenmuch satisfaction. The entry of Japan into the war has been received withindifference by the frontier tribes.In the districts there have been incidents caused by hostile gangs. In one case a lorry was held up in the Kohat District, 4 passengers being killed and4 others kidnapped. In another case on the 21st December raiders held up anunarmed military lorry on the Hangu-Thal road. One British officer, his servantand 4 Indian other ranks were killed and 2 more wounded. Four Indian other ranks were kidnapped and one only escaped.3. Sinkiang. The latest import from the Consul-General at Kashgarexpresses disappointment on the unfriendly and unhelpful attitude of membersof the Soviet Consulate, who appear to assume that their political and commercial interests are necessarily opposed to ours. His impression is that the Russiansdo not wish to weaken the general anti-British sentiment by any display ofco-operation.   He suggests that this policy is locally inspired. :4. Goa. -The Consul at Nova Goa has reported that the occupation ofTimor has caused a considerable sensation, the initial trend of opinion showingnervous anxiety that this will afford Germany with a pretext to overrun Portugal.The crews of the German ships in Marmagao are reported to have given out thatthey expect to be interned at any time and hint at a British occupation.(16) Economic.Nothing to report. -;(17) Finance. &apos;%1. Repatriation of sterling debt. -The report for February 1941 recordedthe repatriation of the bulk of the &apos;&apos; dated&apos;&apos; sterling stocks. The co-operationof the Treasury was secured, and by the use of their special powers theyrequisitioned such holdings of the stocks as were owned by persons resident inthe United Kingdom, which they thereupon sold at the same price to the Govern-ment of India for cancellation. Out of a total of about  84 million (nominal)approximately  61 million was so cancelled at a cost of about  66 million, and about  10f million was cancelled in India under a similar measure taken there.The stock cancelled in India was paid for in rupees or by the issue of rupee stock.Further large accretions of sterling balances have&apos; now made possiblefurther measures of sterling debt repatriation; and two further large-scale operations, comprising the &apos;&apos; undated &apos;&apos; sterling stocks, were announced on the23rd December. First, the 2^ per cent, stock (1926 or after) and the 3 per cent.. stock (1948 or after) were subjected to the same process of requisitioning andcancellation, by virtue of a Vesting Order passed by the Treasury on that day.Secondly, it was announced -that one year&apos;s notice would be given of the
repayment on the 5th January, 1943, of the 3^ per cent, stock (1931 or after).The particulars in respect of the several stocks are as follows   .  .Nominal Amount     Estimated -Acquisitionoutstanding on      Amount of Price perStock. Sept. 30, 1941. Cancellation. Cent.  million. .   million.      s.    d.2i per cent.......        11-0 10 78   2   53 per cent.......        70-7 64 90 16   13-1 per cent. ...       ...        78-6 The whole     To be redeemedat parThus the total amount of the further reduction of Indian sterling debt whichresults from the two operations may be estimated at approximately  151 million!At the end of 1935-36 the sterling debt was about  376^ million. By theend of 1940-41 it had been reduced to  255f million. In the ensuing half yeara further reduction of about  12f million was effected. The combined effect ofthe operations now under review will still further reduce it to something like 92 million, or about a quarter of the figure at which it stood in March 1936.Reduction of external debt is always welcome to the debtor. In this case there is the additional advantage to India that the large sterling balances, whoseexistence makes the operation possible, have mainly to be invested in short-termsecurities, earning very low rates of interest, and thus substantial gain is secured by using them for the cancellation of borrowings bearing much higher rates.From the standpoint of this country, or of general imperial interests, theoperations may also be justified on broad grounds by the fact that the embarrassing-rassing accretions of Indian sterling balances arise from India &apos;s co-operation in the war effort, and that any measure of relief is therefore not of purely domestic concern to India. There are also considerations of a financial character. First,the existence in the hands of the Indian authorities of such great masses of sterling has tended to accentuate the Indian demand for the acquisition of moregold, and there is hope that any inconvenient pressure to this effect can be stavedoff by their utilisation for the repatriation of sterling debt, a purpose intrinsicallypopular. Secondly, it is expected that many of those whose holdings are vestedor redeemed will use the proceeds for investment in British Government DefenceLoans.It should perhaps be added that, from a wider political standpoint, andlooking ahead, there is immense advantage in thus clearing away the bulk ofIndia&apos;s sterling debt. However beneficial to India and to her material develop-ment her ready access to the London market may have been, it is an unescapablefact that the existence of a large sterling debt has come to be regarded as a symboland symptom of India&apos;s supposed bondage to the United Kingdom.2. Measures against trafficking in Bank of England notes. The importa-tion into India in common with other parts of the sterling area of Bank ofEngland notes is already prohibited. In order to strengthen the measures againstprofitable smuggling into India, for sale, of such notes obtained from enemysources, the Government of India have issued an Order under the Defence ofIndia Rules requiring holders of Bank of England notes to present or send themto the Reserve Bank of India before the 4th December, 1941. Notes notsurrendered by that date become liable to confiscation. Travellers passing throughIndia are exempted from the Order; as also are authorised dealers and moneychangers, from whom travellers to the United Kingdom will be able to buynecessary quantities of such notes.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.(18) Military.The first Japanese move against Burma, which took place about the14th December, was in the direction of Victoria Point. The aerodrome therewas demolished by the garrison, which was then evacuated to Mergui. Apartfrom the capture of Victoria Point, the only land operation by the Japanese was an attack on Bokpyin, south of Mergui, which was occupied by them, butsubsequently evacuated on the 29th December.[23379] c
On the 23rd December the Japanese made their first air raid on Rangoonwith a force of 60 bombers, escorted by fighters. Although the harbour was attacked, their main objective was apparently the civilian population. Littlematerial damage was done, though some 15 fires were started, with which the municipal fire services were unable to cope. Casualties, however, were heavyowing to the people not taking shelter; 1,500 were admitted to hospital andthe number of fatal casualties was about 1,000. The Japanese lost 10 planes,the A.V.G. 3 and the RA.F. none.The second raid took place on the 25th December, and comprised 80 bombers and about 20 fighters. The objectives were Mingaladon aerodrome and Rangoonpower station. Some damage was done to the aerodrome, though most of the bombsmissed the runways. The power station was not hit. Civilian casualties wereslight, only 50 cases being admitted to hospital. The Japanese lost certainly 20,and possibly about 27; planes, the A.V.G. 2 and the RA.F. 6, including 2destroyed on the ground. After visiting Mingaladon aerodrome the Governorreported on the 28th December that he did not like the situation, as, although the pilots&apos; morale was high, ground staff seemed depressed owing to the exodus ofmenial labour and to the lack of protection against parachute troops. (Thequestion is under examination by the G.O.C.)The Japanese successes and their occupation of Thailand have created amilitary situation in which Burma&apos;s existing forces are inadequate in strength.Before the outbreak of hostilities Burma&apos;s land forces consisted of an infantry division and some odd forces intended mainly for internal security. She has nowbeen reinforced by the 16th Infantry Brigade, which has been sent from India,and further reinforcements are contemplated. In the air Burma possessed onefighter squadron of the R.A.F. (Buffaloes), while there were also stationed in burma several formations of the American Volunteer Group (Tomahawks), andon the outbreak of war one of their squadrons was allocated to the defence ofRangoon. General Wavell pressed at Chungking for the loan of one or two moresquadrons of the A.V.G., but could get no decision, though at the end of the month the depleted squadron at Rangoon was relieved by one up to strength.The Governor was very anxious to have permission to use for the defenceof Burma certain lease-lend material on its way to China. Negotiations about this took place both with the Americans and the Chinese, but before agreement was reached Sir R. Dorman-Smith, on his own responsibility, unloaded a ship,the Tulsa, and subsequently borrowed some anti-aircraft and Bren guns. Thisquestion is still under discussion.(19) Internal.The population of Rangoon took an anti-Japanese line from the first: therehas been no internal trouble apart from a few seditious posters, and the attitudeof the press is satisfactory. The Governor is particularly gratified at the behaviour of the Ministers who have given him complete support and have madeuseful pronouncements. The Premier, U Saw, is still on his way back to Burmafrom the United States.The severest test of internal morale has, of course, been the raids on Rangoon.These did not apparently cause panic but a disturbing feature was that large-scale evacuation of the labouring population (mainly Indian) which took placeimmediately after the first raid giving rise to difficult problems in connection withthe port, transport undertakings, food supplies, sewage disposal and the treatmentof casualties and the disposal of corpses. These problems were, however, tackledvigorously. Labour was collected into camps and reliable Indians were sent out to talk to the labourers and endeavour to persuade them to return to camps roundRangoon whence transport facilities would be provided to take them to work.On the 31st December it was reported that 50 per cent, of the dock labourershad returned and that trains were working in the dock area. Municipal foodshops were being opened.Convicts were imported to clear up the city and deal with the residue ofcorpse disposal.. Medical arrangements were the worst problem as the exodusof menial and nursing staff made it very difficult to cope with the large number of serious casualties in the first raid. The Governor is trying to evacuate casualties to convalescent camps.
(20) External and Economic.The vice and paddy markets are at a temporary but complete standstill andas an internal security measure the rice Controller has commenced buying paddyin small quantities sufficient to create a market for forced sellers.During November the daily average of lorries crossing the Chinese frontierwas 284 outwards and 237 inwards. 24,085 tons of Chinese Government goods were exported, of which 16,470 were petrol.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.(21) Supplies in War Areas.The Governments of all Colonies which are likely to become a war area havebeen for some time sending telegrams at frequent intervals indicating the amountof their reserve stocks. These are examined in consultation with the War Office,and so far as possible comments and advice are given upon any points that may arise.Plans for the provisioning and supply of Singapore in the event of beleagure-ment are under urgent review.i (22) Supplies from United States.Some anxiety is felt at the apparently little progress which is being madein procuring supplies from the United States for the Colonies. There seems tobe some tendency for consignments, both those under Lease-Lend and thoseobtained by cash payment, designed for the Colonies, to be delayed as comparedwith consignments required for the United Kingdom and the Dominions. Thequestion is under consideration in consultation with other Departments concerned.(23) Commodities.Rubber.Recent events in the Far East have threatened the Allied supplies of rubberfrom Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies. While strenuous measures arebeing taken to get out from the ports in that area existing stocks and to main-tain production, shipping is a great difficulty. Every effort is being directed towards the expansion of production to the maximum in other colonial territories,British and Allied, but potential production in those areas is very small. TheUnited States will no doubt be asked to exploit to the full the rubber suppliesof the Amazon Valley.Tin.For the same reason tin supplies are precarious, and in this case the only other source of supply in the Colonial Empire is Nigeria, where the mines arealready working at maximum production.Sisal.An agreement is about to be signed for the acquisition by the United Statesof a stock pile of 23,&apos;000 tons of sisal from British East Africa, and a furtherpurchase to bring the stock up to 100,000 tons is contemplated. Having regard to united Kingdom and Dominions requirements it is doubtful whether as much as this can be made available, but production in East Africa could, it is thought,[23379] c 2
be increased to 140,000 tons annually from the present authorised figure of115,000 tons, and the Governments concerned have been requested to take stepsto ensure the maximum production.Oilseeds and Vegetable Oils.Developments in the Far East have made it necessary to explore all possibili-ties of increasing supplies from Africa, including East Africa as well as theWest African Colonies, on which we are already heavily relying. In West Africaan advance has been made in the price of palm kernels in the hope of increasingproduction, but it is at present uncertain whether this will be effective, and othersteps may be necessary, including possibly increased allocation of cotton piece-goods and other manufactured articles for sale to the native producers.Ceylon Graphite.Negotiations are proceeding for the purchase by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentof the entire output of Ceylon for the United Kingdom and the United States.These supplies will be allocated between British and American needs by agreementbetween the two Governments.(24) Currency.Hong Kong.Consideration has been given to the position of Hong Kong bank notescirculating in China. There is a danger that these will go to a discount, and temporary measures have been taken to ensure their encashment for the timebeing through the Central Bank of China in Chungking. There are, however,many practical objections to any such arrangement as a permanency, and thefuture policy is under active consideration.(25) Labour.The Governor of British Guiana has decided that it would be advisable tosplit up the present conjoint Department of Labour and Local Government andto establish a separate Labour Department in charge of an experienced officerfrom this country.A Trade Unionist has now been offered and accepted appointment as DeputyCommissioner of Labour, British Guiana, in charge of the latter Department.As was announced in Parliament last month, it has been decided to establish a Colonial Labour Advisory Committee. This body will consist of theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State (ex o-fficio), as chairman, an assistant under-Secretary of State, my Labour Adviser, and the officer in the social services Department responsible for labour questions; a member of the Ministryof Labour; two members representing employers and two members representingworkers. The British Employers&apos; Confederation and the Trades Union Congresshave been asked to suggest candidates for the last-mentioned vacancies.Defence : Far East War.(26) Preparatory Measures.Telegrams were sent to the Governors of all Colonies situated in the far eastern and Indian Ocean areas, warning them that the situation vis-a-vis japan was deteriorating, and requesting them to consider the introduction forthwith,if necessary, of any measures which would normally be taken only after receiptof the &quot;General Warning&quot; or &quot;War Inevitable&quot; telegram. Replies to these telegrams indicated that the Colonies most nearly affected had placed themselvesin &amp; state of readiness by such measures as the mobilisation of local naval andmilitary forces and of Air Force volunteers, the posting of guards at vulnerable points along the coastline and the institution of a watch for enemy aircraft.Instructions were sent to the Governor of the Straits Settlements on the7th December to arrange, in co-operation with the Commander-in-Chief, far east, for the immediate completion of the Sarawak oil denial scheme. It waslearnt three days later that -the necessary action had been taken.
Ail Colonial Governments were informed on the 8th December that hostilitieshad broken out with Japan and that all security measures appropriate for thewar stage should be taken forthwith. On the 9th December they were notified of the existence of a formal state of war between His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand Japan.(27) Outbreak of War.With the outbreak of war with Japan, Hong Kong and Malaya were immediately involved in hostilities. Islands in the Western Pacific were also attacked, and Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo were later affected. Thefollowing is a brief summary of events in these territories, without, however,purporting to give a detailed military appreciation.(28) Malaya.The States of Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu, Pahang and Perak havebeen invaded by the Japanese land forces. Our own forces, fighting a series ofdelaying actions, have retired from the north-west of the Peninsula, evacuatingPenang, and also southwards from Kota Bharu, which was occupied by the enemyearly on. Isolated landings have been attempted at various points in Trengganuand Pahang on the east coast. Air raids have been carried out on the principalcentres of population, including Singapore, Penang and Kuala Lumpur.The Rulers of Perlis and Kedah left for Perak and Penang respectively onthe Japanese advance. The Ruler of Kelantan resolved to leave his capital, KotaBharu, but to stay in State territory and hand over administrative powers to theBritish adviser. Messages in appropriate terms were sent from the Secretary ofState for the Colonies and the High Commissioner for the Malay States at the timeof the invasion to the Rulers affected. A further message was later sent, conveyingthe Prime Ministers personal concern over the trials which the Rulers and theirpeoples had been called upon to bear, and requesting the High Commissioner togive every assurance on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Rulers and state Governments that their rights will be restored in the final victory. In theFederated Malay States the Federal Council passed a resolution on the21st December expressing the desire of all peoples in the Federated Malay states to associate themselves with the Rulers in reaffirming their unswerving loyalty to His Majesty The King, and their unshakable determination to prosecute thewar to a successful conclusion. A warm acknowledgment of this resolution was sent on The King&apos;s command.A scheme is being undertaken with the co-operation of the Netherlands east indies Authorities for the evacuation of &quot; useless mouths &quot; from Singapore to theNetherlands East Indies, without discrimination of race.In order to allow of the proclamation of martial law in any areas where itis thought desirable, legislation has been passed suspending Habeas Corpus inrespect of offences tried by military courts. It is intended that all offences notarising out of the war and less serious war offences shall still be tried by civil courts.A rigorous &quot; denial&quot; policy is being followed in Malaya. Instructions havebeen sent to destroy tin dredges, rubber stocks and factories and coagulants andall other materials of value to the enemy, including the Government stores offood (but leaving stores for native subsistence), motor and rail stock and alsoroads, bridges and river transport.In the evacuation of Penang on the 18th-19th December the denial action was unfortunately not completed. This is now the subject of enquiry.Information so far received shows that the place had been subjected to severeair attack on the preceding days and very short notice of the order to evacuatewas given. There is reported to have been much confusion due to failure ofAsiatic labour and the strain imposed on Europeans in maintaining minimumessential services. It was also decided that destruction by fire and explosiveshould be kept, to the minimum in order to conceal from the enemy that evacuationwas in progress.(29) Sarawak.Warships and transports appeared off Miri on the 16th December and enemy forces were later landed at Miri. The situation is obscure, but the enemyappears to have strengthened his position and has occupied Kuching, the capital,which had previously been raided from the air.
(30) Hong Kong.Japanese forces crossed the land frontier into the New Territories on the8th December and Kowloon was raided from the air. Our forces withdrew aftercarrying out certain demolitions. On the 11th December the enemy forces were reported to have strengthened their positions, and our troops were withdrawnfrom the mainland, and Kowloon was occupied by the enemy. At this stageletters were received by the Governor from Japanese Commander-in-Chief asking him to enter into parleys for the surrender of Hong Kong. These requests werecategorically refused. Between the 16th and 18th December the island wassubjected to shelling and air raids. The enemy then succeeded in effecting a landing on the east side of the island, and made further landings at other points.The landing parties were engaged by our forces, but in the course of a week&apos;sstubborn fighting the enemy succeeded in consolidating his positions and graduallygained control of the greater part of the island, including the water supply. on christmas Day a telegram was received from the Governor reporting that he had refused a further request for surrender, but later in the day a further telegram was received fom the Governor, who reported that the military and navalcommanders had advised him that no further effective resistance could be made and that he was taking action in accordance with that advice. The Colonyaccordingly surrendered to the enemy in circumstances in which no other course was possible. Messages from His Majesty The King, the Prime Minister, theSecretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State for War were sentto Sir Mark Young at various stages of the defence, expressing the admirationof those at home for his own inspiring leadership and for the magnificent fightwhich was being waged by the Imperial and Local Forces against overwhelming-odds, and in a final message the thanks of His Majesty&apos;s Government wereconveyed to Sir Mark Young and all who had taken part in the defence of theColony.No news of conditions in the Colony has been received since it was occupiedby the Japanese. A number of naval and military officers and one Colonial officialsucceeded in escaping in small boats to the Chinese mainland.(31) Western Pacific.A Japanese landing has been made at Tarawa, a large atoll on which the headquarters of the Northern Gilberts district of the Gilbert and Ellice IslandsColony are situated. So far no permanent occupation seems to have taken place,but it is understood that the island of Makin (Butaritari) at the extreme north of the Gilberts Group, about 260 miles from the Japanese Marshall Islands, isbeing prepared by the Japanese for use as a base for seaplanes and surface craft.Ocean Island, the capital of the Colony, containing one of the world&apos;s richestphosphate deposits, has been bombed by enemy aircraft several times and theResidency practically demolished. No casualties were suffered. The demolitionscheme designed to prevent the Japanese from working the phosphate mines andloading gear for a considerable period has been carried out. It is believed thatsome Government officers have been taken prisoner.European women and children had been evacuated some weeks ago fromOcean Island, and all except a number of Roman Catholic sisters of the SacredHeart Mission were successfully removed from the islands now in japanese occupation.It is understood that the United States Government is making arrangementsfor the defence of Canton Island, the first port of call south of Honolulu for the pan-American Trans-Pacific Clipper service to New Zealand.A submarine has been reported at Nukufetau, in the Ellice Islands, some500 miles north of Fiji.(32) North Borneo.Jesselton wireless station was attacked on the 27th December with machine-gun fire from an enemy airplane; but no damage or casualties were caused. Upto the end of December&apos;no landings had been attempted.
Reports on Particular Colonies.(33) West Indies-United States Bases.An agreement has been negotiated with the United States setting out theprocedure for dealing with defence problems in the Colonies in which UnitedStates Bases have been established. This agreement provides inter alia fox the setting up of combined (British and United States) Defence Committees and itis now in operation.The United States have asked for more land in Bermuda. Owing largely tothe tactful handling of the matter by the Governor, this request has been receivedby the Bermudian representatives more favourably than was expected. It hasbeen agreed that the United States should take possession of the desired additionalareas immediately on short leases, and that the question of longer leases, togetherwith other questions arising out of the Bases, should be discussed with the state department by a Bermuda delegation in Washington early next year.The United States have also asked for additional areas in other Colonies for aircraft warning stations. Here, too, they have been granted permission totake possession of the areas without prejudice to the provisions and terms of theleases.The American soldier accused of murdering a coloured West Indian inTrinidad has been acquitted by a United States court martial. There is somedissatisfaction in the Colony at this verdict, as it is considered that on theevidence the accused would have been convicted in a Trinidad Court.A second native of Antigua has been shot and killed by an American soldier,and there have been other incidents in the Island between United States personnel and local inhabitants. The situation is giving cause for some anxiety. It isbeing brought to the notice of the United States authorities in Washington.(34) West Indies.A scheme has been agreed with the Ministry of Labour for bringing overto the United Kingdom 200 male West Indian workers for training in government training centres and subsequent employment in engineering trades. It is hopedthat the first batch will be brought over by about the middle of February.2. Proposals are under discussion with the Government of the United states for the setting up of a Joint Anglo-United States Commission in the Caribbeanarea for the periodic interchange of views regarding measures for the improve-ment of agriculture, education, public health, housing, and other welfare matters.It is proposed that there should be two co-chairmen, the United states representative being Mr. Taussig and the British, Sir Frank Stockdale,Comptroller for Development and Welfare in the West Indies. There willprobably be two other representatives on each side, but the details of the proposalhave not yet been settled.(35) Gold Coast.At the end of November about three hundred men employed by the gold coast Government Railway at Takoradi came out on strike. A number of claims for improvements in conditions of service had been put forward by the men. TheGovernment was unable to approve all of these, and the points in dispute hadbeen referred to arbitration. Before arbitration could be initiated, however, themen came out on strike. The strike spread to Kumasi, Sekondi, Accra and other places. The Committee which had been appointed in October to investigate therise in the cost of living, made an interim recommendation for the grant of atwenty per cent, cost of living bonus to all Government labour receiving wagesnot exceeding two shillings and sixpence per day. This was accepted by theGovernment, and the strike ended on the 10th December.(36) Palestine.No events of special interest occurred during December.The Arabs generally regard the accretion of strength to the Allied Causethrough the entry of America into the war as likely to be ultimately decisive; itis recognised, however, that Japan&apos;s offensive may lengthen the war, and there is some anxiety lest it may affect supplies to the Middle East. On the whole theJews take a gloomier view of the recent extension of the war than the Arabs.Allied successes in Russia and Libya have had a very heartening effect on bothcommunities.
