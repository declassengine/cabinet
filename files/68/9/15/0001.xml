(this document is the&apos;property op his britannic majesty1s^ government)NoSP EETW.P. (R) 0&amp;) 1515th March, 19&apos;;2.i attach, for the information of my colleagues,hrief report for the month of Pebruary, 1942&apos;.

SWEDEN/The Latin American countries are beginning slowly to carry out theeconomic warfare recommendations of the Rio Conference.     The attitude ofArgentina has heen unsatisfactory and that of Chile hesitant,SPAINThe U.S. Authorities have agreed to release tankers for Spain, andare understood to have worked out a provisional programme to cover Spanishrequirements for the next two months.     Their programme envisages the closing of the Spanish refinery in Teneriffe, to avoid the wastage of tankerspace which results from the carriage of crude oil instead of refined products.     This will have the additional advantage of stopping illicitexports of aviation spirit and of making possible a much more accurate check on Spanish imports and consumption.The U. S. Government have decided to take part in preemptive purchases in the Peninsula   as well as making supply purchases of their own, and have sent over a representative of the Federal Loan Agency with instructions to cooperate closely with the TJ.K.G.C.     We have recommended a jointprogramme for Spain including preemptive purchases of wool and woollenmanufactures, skins, wolfram and olive oil, at an estimated expenditure of 15 to  17 millions.     Meanwhile our own purchases of these goods in Spainare held up by the refusal of the Spanish Government to grant export licences unless we allow them 2,000 tons of rubber, the supply of which has there fore become of great importance.     With the concurrence of the Ministryof Supply, the Combined Raw Materials Board in Washington have been stronglyrecommended to agree.PORTUGALThe Portuguese authorities have postponed the introduction of controlover wolfram, as the administrative machinery was not ready.     Meanwhile., wehave been exercising strong pressure, in cooperation with the U.S., tosecure a more satisfactory division of the market between the Allies and the axis,     The Portuguese have so far refused to budge and seem disposed to makea political issue out of our demands.     They may have already undertakendefinite commitments to Germany in return for guaranteed supplies offertilizers, iron and steel etc, -The Portuguese oil situation remains serious and stocks are nowapproaching exhaustion.     Negotiations have, however, been virtuallycompleted for the time charter of ono Spanish tanker;   one, and possiblytwo more are to be chartered for single voyages, and it is now reportedthat the Armistice Commission have agreed to the charter by the French to thePortuguese of two French tankers now in the Mediterranean.FRENCH colonies at the beginning of February H.M. Ambassador at Washington was asked to urge that future supplies to French North Africa should be basedpreferably on a barter deal involving the whole of the exportablesurpluses of this territory which are at present going to France or the enemy or, failing that, at least on the stile to the U.S.A, of important commoditiessuch as cobalt, manganese, molybdenum and wool, and if possible theunshipped balance of the rubber carried by the blockade runner &quot;FrancoisL.D.&quot;     All discussions have, however been suspended by the U,S.Government pending the receipt of satisfactory assurances from Vichy aboutsupplies sent from or via French North Africa to enemy forces in Libya whichhave included A,000 tons of petrol.     For the same reason the question ofan arrangement regarding Madagascar similar to that proposed for French north africa and including the preemption of graphite mica and hides has not yetbeen pursued.     The South African Government were in any case opposed to aneconomic agreement with the Madagascar! authorities&apos;.
For political and other reasons, wc decided, with the concuvrcro/- -,fthe U. S. Government to grant havicerts for hides, wool and dynamite givrpv.!already bought by the Swedes but which had been held tip because of our gv^idifficulties.     We also allowed the Swedes to import 400 tons of nibber&apos; 4^had been loaded on a Swedish ship on the understanding that it would beunloaded at a British port if we so demanded.     The principle that even veryscarce materials should be allowed,to neutrals in order to gain importanteconomic or political advantages, was thus, established,TURKEYThe U.S. Government have begun to take a welcome interest inpreemption in Turkey,     We have impressed on them tho importance of avoidingconfusion and competitive buying and have urged that any purchases should bemade through the U.K,C,C,RELIEFDuring the month arrangements were practically completed for the shipment in the s.s, &quot;Radmanso&quot; from Haifa of 7,000 tons of the 8,000 tonsof wheat which H.M.G, agreed in January to send tb Greece,     Progress wasalso made with plans   for the Swedish s,s, &quot;Hallaren&quot; to sail from the-Baltic to Greece,     She will pick up at Lisbon 4,500 tons of wheat from Swissstocks and 250 tons of Portuguese salted fish, and will later.be put into service between Turkey and Greece,,Shipments from Turkey have been resumed, and it is hoped that they willcontinue at the rate of 4,000 tons a month at least until the end of April,A plan for the institution of regular, supplies of wheat to Greece hasbeen approved by the British and U,S, Governments.    It provides for shipment to be effected in Swedish ships now available in the Baltic and for measures of control to be applied in Greece by a Swedish Commission.     this plan has been sympathetically received by the Swedish Government but hasnot yet been submitted to the enemy powers.     It must be emphasized thatshipments through the blockade are being allowed to Greece alone, andconsist only of cereals or similar products which correspond to Greece1 sessential deficiency.The.plan for the evacuation of Greek children has suffered a set-baekon account of premature and unauthorised publicity, and because theItalian Government raised objection to the reception of children in partsof the British Empire,     No publicity has been given to these difficulties,which it is&apos;hoped will be overcome.
