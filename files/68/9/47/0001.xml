THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1942.SECEET. Copy No.W.P (R) (42) 47.October 26, 1942.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 1942, FOR THE DOMIN-IONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.General Position.1. Public attention in Canada during September was not diverted by any new major war development from the theatres of war on which it was concentratedlast month. Unbounded admiration was expressed for the defenders of stalingrad, the headlines being alternately hopeful and depressed. Second frontagitation increased again with reports of Russian dissatisfaction at the failureof the Allies to create a diversion in the west.2. The publication of casualties suffered in the Dieppe raid proved some-thing of a shock and created some bewilderment, the general feeling being that,whatever was learned, the cost was high. Considerable dissatisfaction has been expressed at the treatment given to the raid by United States newsreels, whichemphasised the part played by United States soldiers at the expense of the canadians.3. Mr. Arthur Meighen, the Leader of the Canadian Conservative. Party,has announced that a Party Convention is to be held, probably in November, toconsider the leadership of the party. There has been considerable agitationwithin the party against the leadership of Mr. Meighen (who is without a seat inParliament), and early in September an unofficial Convention of Conservativeswas held in Ontario, to which Mr. Meighen and other regular leaders were notinvited. The statement of aims and objectives produced was disavowed, by theRight wing element in the party, and it is likely that the forthcoming Conventionwill witness a strong attempt by the more progressive section to gain controlof the party.4. A series of Orders in Council on man-power regulations were issuedduring September, the aim being to concentrate control of all movements oflabour in the hands of the National Selective Service Department. amongst other things, the regulations prohibit any worker from seeking new work withouta permit from a National Selective Service Officer.5. Labour unrest continues. The most serious dispute is in the steelindustry, where the Unions are pressing for wage increases. A strike has been averted by the creation of a Commission to review the situation. It is regarded in the nature of a test case to see how rigidly the wages &quot; ceiling &quot; is to beapplied. The annual Convention of the Trades and Lcibour Congress which met in Winnipeg has condemned the administration of the wage ceiling policy andthe Government&apos;s failure to safeguard collective bargaining rights.s[24526]&apos; b
Naval, Military and Air Activities.6. A Canadian Joint Staff in Washington has been formed, to representthe Canadian Chiefs of Staff. The members of the Joint Staff are Major-general maurice A. Pope, M.C., Chairman, Rear-Admiral Victor G. Brodeur, R.C.N., andAir Vice-Marshal G. V. Walsh, M.B.E.7. H.M.C.S. Huron has been launched; she is the third Tribal classdestroyer to be launched in Great Britain for the Royal Canadian Navy.8. H.M.C.S. Preserver, the first to complete of two base supply ships, wascommissioned in July. Three minesweepers and one corvette were alsocommissioned.9. A Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron and a Fighter Squadron of theR.C.A.F. are in Alaska operating under United States Command. A/A Units ofthe Canadian Army are also in Alaska.10. Major-General G. R. Pearkes, V.C., D.S.O., M.C., relinquishedcommand of 1st Canadian Division with effect from the 1st September, and wassucceeded by Major-General H. L. N. Salmon.11. Major-General C. B. Price relinquished command of 3rd canadian division with effect from the 8th September, and was succeeded by Major-GeneralR. F. Keller.12. R.C.A.F. fighter squadrons claimed two enemy aircraft destroyed, threeprobably destroyed and six damaged. Pilots of these squadrons were awardedone bar to D.F.C. and five D.F.Cs. during the month. Night fighter squadronsclaimed two enemy aircraft destroyed, one probably destroyed and one damaged.Bomber squadrons took part in all the major raids of the month except for408 and 420 Squadrons, which were re-equipping, the former with Ffalifaxes,the latter with Wellington Ills. Two R.C.A.F. bombers were lost. The D.F.C.was awarded to two pilots of 405 Squadron. No. 418 Intruder Squadron destroyedone locomotive, disabled three and damaged six during night hunts over occupied territory; two aircraft were lost. No. 407 (Hudsons) continued their attacks on shipping and claimed several direct hits and near misses. No. 422 general reconnaissance Squadron was in the process of changing over from Catalinasto Sunderlands, and consequently was struck off operations.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.General Position.13. Despite the efforts of the press and the Government to bring home tothe Australian public the real seriousness of the war situation, it has succeeded in taking the people out of their mood of complacent acceptance only for short periods. Thus,, when the Japanese were making rapid progress in New Guineathere were alarmed comments and criticisms of the conduct of the campaign, butfaith in the prowess of the Australian soldier and news of the Allied offensivedispelled much of the anxiety, and the main preoccupation of the public appearsto be the restriction of racing and the austerity campaign the latter beingsupported by the press, but showing few results so far.14. The defence of Stalingrad received headlines full of admiration, and press comment aimed at showing that even if it fell (which was regarded as inevitable) the Russians would still be able to carry on the war. The continuedfailure of the Germans to occupy the city has, however, produced a wave ofoptimism, and faith in the &quot;Red spirit&quot; and the approach of winter hassomewhat blinded the public to the magnitude of the struggle and the importanceof the outcome. There has been a certain amount of discussion on reports thatthe Allies and Russia do not see eye to eye on the conduct of the war, andMr. Wendell Willkie&apos;s statements reawakened calls for the early opening of asecond front.15. The National Security Regulations establishing a Women&apos;s Employ-ment Board were disallowed by the Senate, the Opposition^ criticism being thatit was an attempt to override the Arbitration Court. The Government, therefore,introduced legislation to deal with the matter and indicated that any use ofthe Opposition majority in the Senate to prevent the Bill becoming law wouldprecipitate a general election, since government could not be carried with a hostile
Opposition. The political crisis, however, now seems likely to pass, owing tothe reluctance of the Opposition to force matters to such a point.16. Legislation has been introduced imposing drastic penalties for blackmarketing and making the penalty of imprisonment compulsory. The business community regard these measures&apos;as &quot;window dressing&quot; and as part of theGovernments aggressive policy towards private enterprise.17. The Attorney-General stated that a Bill was being introduced adoptingSections 2-6 of the Statute of Westminster.Naval, Military and Air Activities.18. H.M.A.S. Voyager grounded heavily in Betano Bay, Timor, on the 23rd.She was subsequently attacked by aircraft and became a total loss. The crew were rescued and returned to Australia.19. The 9th Australian &quot;Division was holding the Northern sector of theEl Alamein position; the sector remained quiet throughout the month and activity was limited to patrolling.20. New Guinea. The Japanese forces which landed on the Northernshores of Milne Bay on the 26th August have now either withdrawn or beeneliminated.21. In the Port Moresby area the Australian troops were forced to with-draw under Japanese pressure from the Kokoda area to positions on the Imitaridge, where they were reinforced. Lighting was at times severe and often bitter.The Australians have since resumed the offensive, recaptured the Ioribaiwa ridge,and at the end of the month were still advancing. 25-pdr. field artillery was recently employed for the first time with considerable effect. The strength of theJapanese forces forward of Buna is estimated at 8,000 combatant troops.22. The 1st Australian Armoured Division and the 1st and 2nd AustralianMotor Divisions are to be reorganised on Middle East establishment as 1st, 2ndand 3rd Australian Armoured Divisions respectively. Reorganisation is expectedto begin towards the end of October 1942.23. A total of 127 separate Allied air attacks were made on selected areasin enemy-occupied territories, principally in the New7 Guinea area. Aerodromes,grounded aircraft, naval vessels, transports and landing barges were attacked and enemy troops at Milne Bay were machine gunned. Results achieved in most cases were satisfactory.24. During the period under review reconnaissances were conductedthroughout the New Guinea, Solomon Islands, New Britain, Timor, Koepang,Buna and Gona areas, protection provided for overseas and inter-State convoys,and protecting patrols afforded to shipping in local areas.25. A total of ten enemy air attacks were carried out, four being upon port moresby, five at Darwin, and the remaining one at Fall River. Slight damage was sustained as a result of several of these attacks.Economic.26. The Commonwealth Government concluded with the United StatesGovernment on the 3rd September an Agreement relating to Reciprocal Aid, which follows fairly closelv the lines of the United Kingdom-United States Agreement(Cmd. 6389) of the same date.NEW ZEALAND.General Position.27. During the early part of September the New Zealand public grewoptimistic about the prospects of the war in the Pacific, its optimism being-strengthened by the statements of Mr. Wendell Willkie, General Wavell and thePrime Minister of New Zealand, all of wrhom gave the impression that theJapanese threat was receding. In an attempt to stem this wave of unfoundedoptimism, the Acting Prime Minister published a statement that the danger hadby no means passed and that &quot; a great show-down in the Pacific &quot; must beexpected. The enemy advance in New Guinea was interpreted as evidence of japan&apos;s intention to continue the drive southwards, and, with Allied difficulties,the tone of press comment became more anxious.[24526] b 2
28. News from the Middle East did not receive a prominent place and reports of British successes there were treated with caution. To New Zealand thedefence of Egypt appeared to be unimportant compared with the defence of theSolomons.29. Second Front agitation seems to have remained slight; the fail of stalingrad was regarded as inevitable, and the prospect of an early decision tothe war vanished. Hopes for the salvation of Russia were placed in the earlyonset of winter.30. The most important domestic event during September was the illegalstrike at Waikato, North Island, of 1,200 coal miners, against the recommenda-tion of Union leaders, and the political repercussions that took place. despite the sentence of a montlrs imprisonment imposed on some 180 miners, the strikecontinued, and ended only after the Governments decision to assume control of the mines concerned for the duration of the war, after which they are to be returnedto their owners. The Governments handling of the situation aroused strong publicdissatisfaction, and the suspension of the imprisonment sentences was regardedas yet another surrender to the miners. The Leader of the Opposition,Mr. Holland, announced that the Opposition caucus had decided that six repre-sentatives of the Opposition in the War Administration and War cabinet should be withdrawn as a protest against this capitulation. It is reported thatthe Opposition have for some time felt that Mr. Holland made a bad politicalbargain in consenting to enter the War Administration, and this opportunity of breaking away has been seized. Mr. Coates (Minister of Armed Forces) andMr. Hamilton (Associate Minister of Supply and Munitions) have, however,accepted the Prime Minister&apos;s invitation to rejoin the War Cabinet, though not as representatives of the National Party, and they have expressed their disappointment -proval of the Opposition resignations and of the demands by the Leader of theOpposition for a general election. It is now considered that the Prime minister has once again out-manoeuvred his opponents.31. Some improvement is reported in the presentation and content of newsabout the United Kingdom, the newspapers being less exclusively devoted to articles reprinted from United Kingdom papers criticising or ridiculing theUnited Kingdom Government.Naval, Military and Air Activities.32. H.M.N.Z.S. Achilles is undergoing a refit at Auckland. H.M.N.Z.S.Leander was on duty with the United States naval forces in the South Pacific,and H.M.N.Z.S Monowai (armed merchant cruiser) was also doing duty in theSouth Pacific area.33. The 2nd New Zealand Division in Egypt was relieved by the 44th(United Kingdom) Division on the 10th and moved back into a support area. Itis still in I3tn Corps, 8th Army.34. The strength of the New Zealand forces in the Middle East is now31,612 with drafts of 4,555 men waiting to be sent there.35. Arrangements have been made to send an aerodrome construction unitto New Caledonia.Economic.36. The New Zealand Government concluded with the United StatesGovernment on the 3rd September an Agreement relating to Reciprocal Aid,which follows fairly closely the lines of the United Kingdom-United StatesAgreement (Cmd. 6389) of the same date.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.General Position.37. Opinion on war news continued to be clearly divided between Govern-ment and Opposition followers, the latter following their customary arguments for the withdrawal of the Union from the war. The continued resistance of theRussians at Stalingrad has been given prominent treatment, even in theOpposition press. Government papers are beginning to display cautioushopefulness, but devote considerable space to the need for the opening of a second front by the Allies.   Mr. Wendell Willkie&apos;s statements were quoted in support
of their arguments on the necessity to relieve pressure on Russia, whatever thecost. ,38. Government supporters welcomed the renewal of activity in Madagascarand expressed relief when it was announced that all the harbours and the capitalwere in Allied hands.   Opposition papers refrained from comment.39. Satisfaction was expressed in the Government press about the improvedposition in Egypt, and, in a speech at Pretoria, General Smuts stated that asa result of the steps taken after he and Mr. Churchill had discussed the middle east theatre of war, the danger was less, and the situation was improving,though the Allies would have to make bigger efforts than before.40. The Union-wide Congress of the Nationalist party at Pretoria opened.on the 16th September. It ended in an atmosphere of anti-climax with nothing-achieved but a reaffirmation of the Republican programme and an expression of approval for Dr. Malan&apos;s attacks on rival Afrikaner groups. An attempt tobring the Opposition leaders together was made by a self-appointed &quot; co-operativecommittee.&quot; Dr. Van Rensburg, Mr. Pirow and Mr. Havenga appeared at themeeting place, but Dr. Malan refused to attend and is now consequently beingcriticisea for hindering one more attempt to establish &quot;Afrikaner Unity.&quot;The rank and file of the Opposition are showing increasing impatience at thequarrels of their leaders, who seem unable to subordinate ideological and personalrivalries to the attainment of unity.41. The Deputy Prime Minister, in the course of a speech on the5th September, announced that no matter what the result of a general electionmight be, the Government was not going to hand the country over to people who would make peace with Germany. The Opposition has reacted violentlyagainst this statement, and, despite an assurance by the Government that the deputy Prime Minister spoke without authority, there is still much feeling.42. The time needed for the re-delimitation of constituencies makes itimpossible for a general election to be held before next June at the earliest.Naval, Military and Air Activities.43. The 1st South African Division remained in the same sector of theEgyptian battlefront as reported last month; there were no major operations and activity was confined to patrolling.44. The total European strength of Union forces as at the end ofSeptember was 16,326 officers and 186,086 other ranks, of whom 1,910 officersand 54,341 other ranks are on part-time service.45. There are now five S.A.A.F. fighter squadrons, four light bomber squadrons and one Army co-operation squadron serving in the Middle East.Economic.46. Mr. Sturrock, the Union Minister of Railways and Harbours, remained in London throughout September and continued his talks with United kingdom ministers and officials on shipping, supply and financial questions. He returnedto the Union early in October.NEWFOUNDLAND.47. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, accompanied by his parliamentary Private Secretary, Mr. Arthur Jenkins, M.P., paid a short visit to Newfoundland and Canada in September. Arriving at the Gander airportin Newfoundland on the 14th September, Mr. Attlee first spent some days at st.. John&apos;s, during which he visited Bell Island and some neighbouring outposts,and then made a tour of inspection of Grand Falls and Corner Brook. In thecourse of his stay in Newfoundland Mr. Attlee went over the new United Statesbase at Fort Pepperell, St. John&apos;s, and also inspected the headquarters of theCanadian Naval Administration and St. John&apos;s harbour and dockyard. he left Newfoundland for Canada via Port aux Basques on the 25th september and, after three days in Ottawa, arrived back in this country on the30th September.
EIRE.48. Speaking at Kilmore on the 27th September Cardinal MacRory madea sharp attack on the &quot; injustice of partition.&quot; He said &quot; Partition is a grievousinjustice against our whole nation. It is an intolerable injustice against Catholicsdoomed to live in the narrow and unjust domination of the Belfast Parliament.When I read in the press that this war is being fought for the rights andliberties of small nations and then think of my own corner of my country overrunby British and United States soldiers against the will of the nation, I confessI sometimes find it very hard to be patient. I have more than once kept quietwhen I could have wished to give a lead, but I desire to say that my own action was due to the fear that my intervention might do more harm than good.Clerical interference is not much appreciated in the Six Counties, and I wouldbe sorry to give offence to any of my countrymen of any denomination unless could not avoid it.&quot;49. Towards the end of the month wide publicity was given in the UnitedKingdom press to alleged United States complaints that Nazi spies from Eirewere mixing with genuine workers at United States bases in Northern Irelandand were causing the United States counter-espionage agents a serious problem.50. The final results of the local elections in Eire showed successes by theLabour party and Independent groups. In the County Councils Fianna Fail(Government party) won 166 seats; Fine Gael, 84; Labour, 96; Independent, 121;Farmers, 74; other groups, 91. The Corporation results were : Fianna Fail, 27;Fine Gael, 26; Labour, 38: Independent, 43; other groups, 27. The UrbanCouncil results were: Fianna Fail, 53; Fine Gael, 17; Labour, 89;Independent, 100; other parties, 119.51. It is reported that 2,516 comjpensation claims for bomb damage,amounting to  415,000,&apos;have been made to the Eire Government&apos;. These include164 claims for personal injuries.52. At the end of September the Central Bank Bill came before the Senate.In the debate many speakers devoted their speeches to the activities of thecommercial banks, which they blamed for the depression in agriculture, forunemployment and for inability to develop native industry. Replying to the debate Mr. O&apos;Kelly, Minister of Finance, said that power to alter the rate ofexchange was too grave to give to anybody but the Government. The link withsterling was an arrangement deliberately entered into by the elected representa-tives of the people, who could break it off any day they wished on twenty-four hours&apos; notice. There was no national or business humiliation in associatingthemselves with sterling. Mr. 0&apos;Kelly thought it was a dangerous policy to suppose that a Central Bank could solve all social problems, particularlyunemployment. Its chief function was to safeguard the integrity of the nationalmonetary unit. From 1939 to the end of July 1942 excess of imports over exportswas  30 million, and these goods, said Mr. 0&apos;Kelly, had been bought by their sterling assets, which were not to be despised, although he would be happy ifthey were getting more capital goods. Inflation had gone on to a certain extent,despite their efforts to prevent it, and he was afraid it would continue. TheBill passed into Committee, despite a Labour party challenge, by 32 votes to 5.53. Eire imports for August totalled  2,856,270, an increase of  84,842on August 1941. Exports totalled  2,310,056, an increase of nearly  37,000 onAugust 1941. Live animals increased from  518,645 to  1,459,027. Exports offood, drink and tobacco decreased by over  500,000.54. The outward balance of Eire trade in August was  546,214 as comparedwith  1,170,488 in July.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.The Political Situation.55.   Internal affairs remained the chief centre of interest.  The disturbancesand the campaign of sabotage and violence which broke out after the arrest of theCongress leaders on the 9th August had considerably diminished by the end ofthat month, and. although fresh outbreaks occurred in various places throughout-September, mainly in the north-eastern area of India, there was no co-ordinated
attempt to launch a widespread campaign of civil disobedience and steady progress was made in the restoration of communications and of normal conditionsgenerally in the areas which were affected most badly in August those in thenorth of Bihar and the east of the United Provinces. Nor was there any notablerecrudescence of the student activities that were so prominent in August.Although far from feeling, at the end of September, that the trouble could beregarded as finally scotched the authorities could feel that the back of the revolthad been broken and that the future could be faced with confidence.56. The estimate at the end of September of the casualties resulting fromthe numerous occasions when the police or the military were obliged to open fireplaced the number of deaths at 786, of wounded at 1,376. The police suffered34 fatal casualties. 45 cases of derailment occurred, and 276 railway stations were attacked and damaged or destroyed. 36 post offices were destroyed and367 seriously damaged. 180 other Government buildings were destroyed. Therewere some 6,000 cases of damage to telegraph or telephone systems. These figures will help to illustrate the seriousness of the situation which the civil and militaryauthorities had to deal with. A consoling or significant feature of the disturbances was that the Moslems and. the Depressed Classes nearly everywheretook no part; nor wTas there serious unrest among the labouring classes exceptfor the strikes organised by leaders for political motives.57. For the political problem there is still no sign even of a temporary solutionor of a compromise between the political parties on which a solution can alone bebased. The efforts of Dr. Mookerjee and others to mediate such a compromisedo not promise to be successful. There is little hope that the external threat toIndia&apos;s safety will promote the internal unity needed to face it; the general attitude to the war seems to be one of fatalistic acquiescence. Price levels andshortages of commodities are the main source of anxiety among the people; whileeducated opinion, soured by political, frustration, is said to be increasingly anti-British, though not yet pro-Japanese.Indian States.58. There is little of special importance to be reported among the States.Congress agitation, which did not in any area assume the serious proportions ofthe agitation in British India, declined steadily during the month. War rumourswere still numerous, but morale generally continued to be well maintained.Foreign and Frontier Relations.59. Afghanistan. His Majesty&apos;s Minister was instructed to take a suitable opportunity of speaking to the Prime Minister on the war situation generally,with the object of reassuring him as to the strength of the Allies&apos; position, and ofgathering, if possible, some idea of the Afghan Government^ intentions andtendencies, in view of recent indications that they might be endeavouring, in thelight of German progress in the Russian campaign, to reinsure themselves withthe Axis. A recent report from Sir Francis WTyiie stated that the continuedresistance of the Russians, coupled with the firm control by the Government ofIndia of their internal situation, had caused an almost complete, if only-temporary, volte-face of opinion in Kabul.60. The Afghans&apos; claim for compensation for the bombing incident reportedin last month&apos;s summary, though on the high side, was accepted withoutargument, and Sir Francis Wylie was informed by the Afghan Government thatthey regarded the incident as closed. They also expressed their satisfaction atthe manner in which the matter had been settled.61. In order to improve their commercial representation in Kabul, theGovernment of India had intended to replace the present Indian Agent by an indian Trade Commissioner, but preliminary soundings of the Afghan Govern-ment disclosed, somewhat unexpectedly, that they would prefer the appointmentof a Commercial Attache. The Government of India have therefore put forward proposals for the appointment of an Indian in this capacity.62. North-West Frontier. The column despatched to the Tochi Valleywithdrew without opposition, and North Waziristan has since enjoyed a periodof repose, apart from an attack by a hostile gang on road protection troops nearRazmak, which caused some casualties. Air action was taken against the tribesmen responsible, with good results. The Faqir of Ipi turned his attentionto South Waziristan, where a long-standing boundary dispute presented him
with the opportunity to make trouble. His efforts, however, have so far met with little success. Congress envoys to the tribes had a thoroughly discouragingreception.63. Tibet.-Little progress has been made in the negotiations over theTibetan pack route, owing to failure on the part of the Chinese to place theirrepresentatives in a position to take decisions.64.   Nepal. As a result of the Congress disturbances in Bihar, rail and telegraph   communication   between   Nepal   and   India  was   broken   on   the12th August and Raxaul fell into the possession of the Congress on the15th August.   A small detachment of troops  reoccupied Raxaul about the28th August, but rail communication continued to be liable to interruption.   TheGovernment of India, owing to the interruption of communications, were not aware of the situation until some letters got through from Katmandu on the28th August, when they at once made arrangements to establish an aeroplaneservice and to send up a wireless transmitting set.   By the 12th September,through rail and post communication to Raxaul had been re-established.   TheNepalese Government were clearly very much upset at the Government of India&apos;sfailure to safeguard adequately communications between India and Nepal, andin an interview with Colonel Betham, the Maharajah complained somewdiatbitterly that he had been cut off from the outside world for three Aveeks and thatno one in India appeared to care what was happening to him.   He interpretedthis as indicative of the degree of importance attached by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to Nepal which, he said, was looked upon as a minor Indian State, onlyuseful for the supply of Gurkhas for the Army.   The restoration of communi-cations, however, relieved the Maharajalvs mind, and Colonel Betham was ableto report on the 12th September that the atmosphere in Katmandu was 100 percent, and that he felt confident that the fullest co-operation in recruitment ofGurkhas and the prosecution of the wrar generally could be expected from Nepal.This confidence has been justified, as the Maharajah has again agreed to give full assistance towards obtaining our requirements (estimated at 26,000 recruits)for this winter&apos;s recruiting season.65. China. At an interview on the 23rd September, His Majesty&apos;ambassador discussed the Indian situation with the Generalissimo and againlaid stress on the necessity of an agreement between the Indian parties as anessential preliminary to any further progress. Subsequently General ChiangKia-shek also saw the Indian Agent-General, Sir M. Zafrullah Khan, who was able to give him a first-hand account of the position. Both Sir H. Seymour andSir M. Zafrullah Khan received the impression that the Generalissimo will be careful about intervening further. The question of the Chinese EducationMission&apos;s visit to India, which w?as postponed, is now likely to be raised again, but sir H. Seymour anticipates no difficulty in obtaining an assurance that theMission will avoid any undesirable activities of a political nature while in India.66. Sir M. Zafrullah Khan, who was appointed as Indian Agent-general for six months only, is returning to India, and the Agency-General will be left for the time being in charge of the Secretary, Mr. Richardson.67. Persian Gulf. The German advance in Russia caused some apprehen-sion generally early in the month, but the tenacious Russian resistance evokedgeneral admiration, and the general feeling gradually become more confident.Finance.-68. Finance of the war effort. At the commencement of the fourth year of war a brief account of the financial side of India&apos;s war effort so far may benot out of place. Such a summary must of necessity be on broad lines; and thereare many aspects of India&apos;s contribution to the prosecution of the war that arenot touched upon.A. Expenditure.69.   Apart from the cost of equipment supplied from England, India paysfor the full cost of the forces engaged in her local defence.70. The pre-war forces in India consisted of about 55,000 British and150,000 Indian troops. The strength of the British troops in India on the1st September, 1942, was approximately 160,000; and the Indian troops in Indianumbered about 988,000, whilst in addition 300,000 had been sent overseas.
71. The strength of the Royal Indian Navy has expanded (from 2..000 officersand men) to 11,000.72. There were 2,000 officers and men of the R.A.F. stationed in Indiabefore the war; the present strength of the Air Force, British and Indian, isabout 22.000, but a considerable addition to the number of R.A.F. squadronslocated in India is likely to take place in the near future.73. The Government of India has agreed to bear the cost of raising, training and equipping, so far as this can be done from Indian resources, all the additionalIndian troops raised since the outbreak of Avar so long as these are retained inIndia. When Indian troops leave India the cost of their pay and maintenanceis charged against His Majesty&apos;s Government. Similarly, when additionalBritish troops or airmen land in India the cost of their pay and maintenancebecomes an Indian charge. The despatch of additional British forces (ground and air) to India to counter the Japanese accordingly imposes heavy additionalcharges on India so long as they are there, and correspondingly relieves theBritish Exchequer!74. The comparative figures of cost to India of the Indian Defence Forces,pre-war and in the current year, are as follows :  Pre-tvar   1942-43 Estimate   million. million.R.I.N.............      ....         4*Army       ...............      3H 99&quot;R.A.F................       If 46*(Not allocated)    ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 55-133f 205*75. The main methods by which this enormously increased expenditure hasbeen met are indicated under B and C below.B. Taxation.76. Taxes on Income. The burden of Income Taxation is heavier in Indiathan in the United Kingdom up to incomes of about  320 per annum (or ifamounts withheld as post-war credit are not treated as tax, up to rather morethan  400). Above that it is heavier in the United Kingdom than in India. Asregards the higher ranges of income, an income of  10,000 pays in Income-tax and Super-Tax about 43 per cent, in India as compared with 68 per cent, in theUnited Kingdom, and an income of  30,000 pays about 61 per cent, in India ascompared with 86 per cent, in the United Kingdom. The taxation is more than50 per cent, above pre-war rates; and incomes between  112 and  150, whichwere exempt before the war, are now subject to a small tax.77. Excess Profits Tax. This tax was imposed, after the outbreak of war,at 50 per cent., and is now at the rate of 66-2/3 per cent.78. Customs and Excise. The Match Excise Duty has been doubled, andother Excise Duties increased by rates varying between 20 per cent, and50 per cent. The general level of Customs Duty, which was already high, hasbeen increased by 20 per cent.79. Posts and Telegraphs.

A volunteer Indian Medical officer with two orderlies and stores were dropped by parachute at Shingbwiyang to assist 2,000 Chinese troops andrefugees still held up in Burma. *88. Indian armoured divisions are being reorganised to bring them more in line with home organisation. Lieutenant-General G. le Q. Martel is on his wayto India to advise on armoured troops.89. Though there has been a considerable improvement in supply, india has not yet received her full requirements of tanks. Further, a number ofAjnerican tanks recently arrived damaged&quot; by sea water, and difficulties havebeen experienced in reconditioning them in the absence of skilled Americantechnicians.   Efforts are being made to remedy this.90. Two Indian infantry divisions have been reconstituted as lightdivisions with a view to their particular employment on the north-east frontier.91. Field Army formations and units have continued to be employed on internal security duties. This and the damage caused to communications bythe exceptionally heavy monsoon have imposed serious delays on preparations for active operations.92. Air. The diminished intensity of the monsoon has allowed greater flexibility of operations. Patrols, shipping escorts and reconnaissance havebeen carried out over the Bay of Bengal and from Ceylon. Akyab town andaerodrome, and shipping in the port have been successfully attacked on several occasions. Attacks were also made on Mandalay, Myitkyina, Yenangyaung and shipping on rivers. Supplies were dropped on the North Burma evacuationroute. In the early part of the month,a large number of internal securitypatrols were carried out.93. No enemy attacks on shipping have been reported. Enemy reconnais-sance over the Assam and Calcutta area has recommenced, and the enemy air strength in Burma shows some increase.94. General-Over 72,000 recruits were enrolled for the Army in August,despite the recent internal disturbances. Recruitment for the R.I.N. is alsosatisfactory, with the exception of artificers.95. The strength of the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Corps (India) is now 90 officersand 1953 auxiliaries. The auxiliaries comprise 761 Europeans, 256 Indians,830 Anglo-Indians, and 51 Angio-Burmans.* Up to July 31, 1942.
BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.96. Two Burmese of the Thakin party who have escaped from Burma have brought reports which, though too much importance should not be attached to themin isolation, are believed to be bona fide and may be significant of the increasingunpopularity of the Japanese. According to these Thakins, the treatment ofmonks by the Japanese has disillusioned many Burmese who were disposed to welcome them as co-religionists; their attempts to recruit Burmans for the &quot; FreeBurma Army &quot; are not very successful, labour conditions are unsatisfactory, andthere have been clashes between Japanese and Burmese owing to Japanese looting.97. The Governor reports a shortage of food in the frontier districts of burma not occupied by the Japanese owing to food stocks having become denudedto meet the requirements of the Chinese troops and others during the evacuation.He is very anxious that means should be found to supply the essential needs ofthe inhabitants of these areas, who may otherwise be driven by economic stressand hunger into the arms of the Japanese. Poor land communications and ashortage of transport aircraft constitute the principal difficulty in this matter.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the colonies.(Note, In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic A ffairs.98. Pyrethrum. A recent review of Allied requirements has revealed thatthey are far ahead of the visible Allied production, and the possibility is being-explored of extending production even in territories where pyrethrum has not hitherto been grown. This plant, which is used for anti-malarial purposes, is of growing importance owing to the expected stringency in the supply of quinineand other anti-malarial drugs, and to the presence of large number of troops inmalarial areas.99. Economic Situation in West Indies.-T\\e cumulative effect of an acutescarcity of import tonnage to the West Indies, and of decisions on supply grounds to curtail purchases of more and more of the exported commoditiesof the West Indies, has been to throw a severe and increasing strain on the economy and public finances, particularly of Jamaica. Measures have beenin force for many months for the control of the cost of living and for the relief of distress in the hard-hit industries, but the necessity is now being faced ofdealing with the problem on a much wider scale. So far as possible, it isintended to do so rather by steps designed to maintain the framework of existingindustries or to stimulate new production for local use than by relief works ordirect doles, but flexibility will be observed in dealing with particular problems.100. Colonial Costs of Production. With steady increases in costs ofmanufacture in the United Kingdom and the United States, and in freights and insurance, the landed cost of imported essential requirements and of many food-stuffs to the Colonies is mounting rapidly. This, in turn, affects the cost ofproduction of Colonial commodities, many of which are now in urgent demandfor the Allied war effort. As it has been found necessary in the interests of thebest distribution of Allied resources to arrange for the block purchase of theoutput of many commodities by one buyer, such as the Ministry of Food or theMinistry of Supply, on behalf of the Allies, the price of Colonial commoditieshas tended to become more inflexible, and the problem of relating these prices tofluctuating and rising costs of production has become correspondingly moredifficult, particularly since the price of goods exported from this country and theUnited States is subject to no effective control. Means of meeting these difficulties are being considered.[24526]      . D
101. Programmes of Colonial Requirements. Both the request from theUnited States Authorities (mentioned in my report last month) for estimates of colonial requirements over the whole range of exports from the United Statesand the increasing tightness of the civilian supply situation in this country makeit clear that, if proper provision is to be made for Colonial requirements, colonial governments will have to be asked to submit detailed estimates of their futureimport requirements item by item. This would, of course, involve colonial governments, of which many have very small staffs, in a great deal of work, and discussions are now proceeding between the Colonial Office and the Board of trade on the best means of obtaining these programmes with the least burden to colonial governments.Defence.102. Indian Ocean Command. As foreshadowed in paragraph 91 of the july report, the Military Command of Mauritius and Seychelles was transferred from the Commander-in-Chief, India, to the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, East Africa, on the 1st September.H^cSwfpEe 103.    Western  Pacific: (a) Fiji  and   Tonga.-Sir   Philip   Mitchell   has^Teis. 345 &amp; 346 addressed the Secretary of State in a series of telegrams on the subject of thefromGor.,Fiji. future role of the locai Defence Forces in Fiji and Tonga, their reorganisation and, particularly in the case of the Tonga force, their considerable expansion.His general thesis is that the United States assumption of responsibility does notrelieve us of the obligation to maintain local forces adequate to help the Americansas much as possible while they are there and to defend the territories againstraiders in the event of the Americans moving forward to the offensive. At thesame time he has represented the importance of giving some opportunity to thelocal forces of playing a more active role in the war.104. These proposals have been considered in detail by the interested Depart-ments of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and a telegram hasbeen sent to His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand expressing general con-currence in them and the hope that New Zealand may be able to provide thenecessary additional personnel and undertake responsibility for collating thedemands for new equipment. The High Commissioner has also been asked toarrange for the Tongan Government to be consulted regarding the proposedexpansion of the Tongan Defence Force, in view of the serious effect which undueexpansion would probably have on the internal economy of Tonga.105. (b) New Hebrides. An Agreement for the Use, Administration and operation of United States Naval and Air Bases in the New Hebrides has been drawn up locally between the United States Commander-General and the Britishand French Resident Commissioners and signed by them respectively on behalfof the United States and United Kingdom Governments and the Free french national Committee. The text of the agreement has just been received in Londonand is under examination.106. (c) Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony. On the 31st August the HighCommissioner for the Western Pacific informed the Secretary of State that theOfficer-in-Charge of Ocean Island had reported on the 26th August the approach of a ship towards the island and that since then the island radio had been silent.The United States Commander-in-Chief, Honolulu, informed the High Commis-sioner a few days later that he possessed convincing evidence that Ocean andNauru Islands were in enemy occupation and proposed the abandonment of the project of landing food at Ocean Island. The High Commissioner informed him,in reply, that he felt compelled to agree with his proposal in view of recent developments in the Gilbert Islands. These developments were that, on the1st September, the coast-watching station in Abemama Islando reported the approach of three ships escorted by a plane overhead and no further communica-tion was received from the island. On the 2nd September a report was receivedfrom Kuria Island that seven warships were seen east of Aranuka Island travel-ling north. Later that day Kuria reported six warships and one other large vesseloff the entrance to the passage into Abemama Lagoon and stated that planes wereheard continually all the afternoon. On the 3rd September the British Represen-tative on Tarawa reported the arrival of seven vessels, including at least two cruisers, at that island and the landing of many people with what appeared to becargo.  No further communication was received from Tarawa.Tel. 328from H. Cr.Tel. 335from H. Cr.
Reports on Individual Colonies.111. Palestine. The visits of the Minister of State and of Mr. Willkiew-ere appreciated as indicating that the importance of Palestine is not overlooked.112. There was no political activity amongst the Arabs, whose attitudetowards the war remains unchanged.113. Intense political activity has developed in the Jewish communitycentred in the Inner Zionist Committee, arising from the fear that more moderateZionists will secede from the extreme Nationalist movement sponsored by theJewish Agency and Histadruth.   The main developments have been : (1) Reports of a split between Dr. Weizmann and Mr. Ben Gurion in theUnited States because of the latter&apos;s intransigence which hasresulted in the withdrawal from him of the support of AmericanZionists.(2) The critical attitude recently adopted by an influential section ofZionists, hitherto solidly with the Agency, towards the Agency&apos;suncompromising policy regarding the fulfilment of maximumnationalistic demands.(3) A bitter and prolonged attack by the Agency and the press on the Ihudmovement founded by Dr. Magnes. This movement is essentiallyand genuinely in favour of collaboration with the Arabs, based on a federation programme which was outlined in a recent pamphletpublished by Dr. Magnes.107.   The following further message was received from the High Commis- J**^g Crsioner in a telegram dated the 29th September:  &apos; &apos;&quot;Japanese landed Maiana Island a.m. the 25th September; Baru and NonoutiIslands a.m. the 26th September. Kuria Islands reported a.m; the 28th Septemberapproach of enemy warships. Funafuti reported late p.m. the 27th Septemberho contact with Tamana Island station all day. If this means that Tamana nowoccupied by the enemy, the whole of the Gilbert Islands now enemy occupation.&quot;108. (d) British Solomon Islands Protectorate. A tribute has been paid bythe United States Commanders and their staffs who took part in the recent operations, which resulted in the re-occupation of many parts of the Protectorate, .to the part played by Mr. Marchant, the Resident Commissioner, and his smallband of District Officers.   These men have maintained the civil administration in the south-eastern islands throughout the Japanese occupation and were responsible for sending valuable intelligence reports prior to the operations.During the operations they played an active part.   Gratifying reports have also Tel. or 11/9been received showing the extraordinary loyalty of native civil servants and of the trom 1 OT   eb&apos;Islanders generally to the British administration.  Patrols into enemy-held terri-tory were carried out by native volunteers under Mr. Marchant&apos;s direction andresulted in information being brought back which proved to be of great value to T ,the Allied Command.   The people as a whole remained constantly loyal and gave from&apos; h. Cr.help to the invaders only under duress.   Japanese attempts to ingratiate them- Td 34gselves with the islanders and to arouse anti-European feeling entirety failed and from H. o.the natives repeatedly refused to reveal to the invaders the &quot;whereabouts of the europeans remaining in the islands.   Of many stories of individual heroism, the&apos;outstanding one is that of Sergeant-Major Vouza.   This man, whose exploit hasalready received some press publicity, was tortured by the Japanese and left fordead, yet refused to disclose information which he possessed regarding thenumbers and location of United States Marines.109.   S tchell has proposed that special powers should be given tothe Resident Commissioner to enable him to take action on his own initiativeor at the request of the United States Service authorities oh matters which would normally lie outside his competence. The best way of giving effect to this proposals is under discussion with the High Commissioner.110.   West Indies: Control of Local Forces.-The arrangements for transferof control to the War Office have been completed.   It will take effect from the&apos;1st October.
114. There has been a slight improvement in Jewish recruitment, but thefigures remain well below those of July. There is no change in Arab recruitment.Competing demands for labour by the Army and war industries musthenceforward increasingly affect recruitment to the Forces, as demands havenow passed the present available supply.115. The position as regards cereals has eased considerably and local crops are coming into Government stores more quickly than last month. approximately two-thirds of the estimated total for Government is now in Government hands.Government agents entered the Trans-Jordan market for wheat and barley andhave made substantial purchases as a beginning.116. Nigeria and Gold Coast. The appointment of Africans to theExecutive Councils of the Gold Coast and Nigeria has been approved. In theGold Coast two Africans are being so appointed, and in Nigeria two Africansand one European.117. Resident Minister. The Resident Minister has visited Nigeria, theBelgian Congo, and the Fighting French territories.118. Northern Rhodesia. There has been some deterioration in thesituation at the Copperbelt, Northern Rhodesia, during the latter part ofSeptember, and, as a precautionary measure, steps are being taken to reinforcetemporarily the troops stationed in the territory.119. West Indies. Sir Cosmo Parkinson, accompanied by Mr. P. Rogers,has left on a visit to West Indian Colonies as the personal representative of the Secretary of State, in order to discuss local problems with the Governors. SirCosmo Parkinson and Mr. Rogers arrived in British Honduras on the 17th ofSeptember.120. Ceylon. The Government of India have released, with effect fromthe 1st September, 1942, the ban on the emigration of unskilled labourers to ceylon, imposed in 1939, as far as it applies to labourers now in Ceylon, i.e.,such men will be able to pay visits to India without running the risk of having their return forbidden. The Government of Ceylon propose, if this results inan abnormal efflux of labour in essential services, to control exit by an orderbased on the United Kingdom Essential Work (General Provisions) Order.  &quot;121. An order has been made by the Governor to control the holding ofpublic meetings and processions in certain areas. The immediate cause of theorder was that a number of meetings were being organised in support of theIndian Congress party in areas in which there were a considerable number of indians engaged in essential services.122. The term of appointment of Sir Andrew Caldecott, as Governor of ceylon, which would normally expire this summer, has been extended indefinitely.
