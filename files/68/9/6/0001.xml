Canned fruitvegetables:Jam:About 30 thousand tons of canned fruit, 53thousand tons of canned tomatoes and 45 thousand tons of canned peas are available for distribution under the points scheme, Theirissue will help to conserve stocks of canned meat and fish.Difficulties in obtaining labour and packingmaterials are probably the principal causes ofthe decline in jam production in December.    Thesupply position for pectin has improved andfruit pulp stocks represent more than 6 months1supply.Dried fruit:Total stocks fell from-45-thousand tons at end-November to-39&apos;thousand tons at end-December but are likely to rise in January abovethe end-November level.other commodities-.Tea-:The increase in total stocks in December wasslight but there wj.il be a substantial rise inJanuary-March when arrivals reach their seasonalpeak.Cocoa:The&apos; downward trend in stocks of raw cocoa beansis likely to be reversed in January.Beer:The reduction of the average gravity&apos;of beer by a-:further 5fo,  15% in all, makes possible, a production of 30 million bulk barrels in-1942    -as compared with 26 million bulk barrels in1938/39 but this level can be attained only ifsufficient labour is available.pilMAhp!DIN&amp;TUFFSStarch: If the loss of Far Eastern supplies of tapiocaflour and sago flour is to be made good,  increased imports, of maize starch from TJ.S.A. will be. necessary.Stocks and prospective production of protein feeds appear ample tomeet ration demands in January and February.    The cereal feedposition is much weaker and there is little margin over estimated requirements. -VI.
