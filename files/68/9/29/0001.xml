Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (R) (42) 29.June 25, 1942.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF MAY 1942 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.General Position.IN foreign affairs the recent plebiscite vote, with its bearing on the FrenchCanadian attitude towards the war, the British naval and land operations inMadagascar, and Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s statement on Canadian relations with vichy France, all combined to keep alive an interest in Vichy France and formed the main topics of discussion during the month.2. The Madagascar action was interpreted as the end of appeasement ofVichy a policy of which the Canadian public was already weary and even the trench-Canadian press emphasised that Madagascar was to be held &quot; in trustfor France 5&apos; and that the United Kingdom had no territorial ambitions in that direction.3. Much disappointment and some indignation was expressed in the press at Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s statement that relations between France and canada would continue, as the breaking of relations had been widely and hopefully fore-cast despite the Prime Ministers revelation that the United Kingdom Govern-ment washed Canada to preserve the link with Vichy. On this subject the French-Canadian press was in agreement with the Canadian Government for the first time for many weeks. The later announcement that Vichy French consulatesand agencies were to be closed tended, however, to satisfy all but the most extremeopinion on either side.4. The course of the titanic struggle in Russia, which was invariablyreported in the press as being entirely favourable to the Russians, helped to stimulate the feeling that the United Nations had turned the corner and had at last taken the initiative. President RoosevelCs Maritime Day Speech, which contained warnings against over-optimism, was quoted in some editorials, buta mood dangerously near complacency was evident.5. In Empire matters, Mr. Churchill&apos;s broadcast and speech at Leeds wereuniversally acclaimed, and there was a feeling of high confidence towards the endof May, which shows that Canada has been enjoying the same mood of sanguineoptimism which has been evident in the United States, despite the sinking ofships within sight of the Quebec shores.6. The United Kingdom by-election results aroused considerable commentand were regarded as indications of a general desire for a more vigorous prosecu-tion of the war![23990]B
7. On the 18th May attention was focussed on the Air Training conference which opened at Ottawa. The gathering in Canada of the greatest Allied airexperts and technicians was regarded as a tribute to the notable work done by canada in air training.8. In domestic matters the Conference itself was made the occasion for apolitical truce, but this temporary measure could not hide the confusion which now exists in Canadian politics. The political scene is considerably disturbed by the reactions of the French-speaking Canadians of Quebec to the recentplebiscite (see last month&apos;s summary). The whole country has, in fact, beenbrought face to face with all the evidences of racial disunity, and in Quebecitself the Province is for the most part now militantly anti-conscriptionist. the plebiscite aroused in a dangerous form all the latent racial animosity, and oneof the tangible results has been the re-emergence into public life of M. MauriceDuplessis. the well-known Isolationist ex-Premier of Quebec. The conscriptionissue (for hardly anyone in Quebec or in any of the other Provinces treats the plebiscite vote as other than one for or against conscription) was discussed inthe Quebec Provincial Legislature, and a resolution, which was supported by thePremier, was. passed, urging the Canadian Government not to introduceconscription.9. Thoughtful people in Canada are undoubtedly very anxious about theeffect which the conscription question will have on Canadian unity, althoughM. Godbout and other prominent French-Canadians have done their best to stillthe troubled waters by stressing Quebec&apos;s loyalty and willingness to play her full part in the Canadian war effort on a voluntary basis.10. When Mr. Mackenzie King announced that as a logical consequence ofthe vote on the plebiscite &quot; he would ask Parliament to repeal the section of theNational Resources Mobilisation Act which forbids the conscription of Canadiansoldiers for overseas service,&quot; he precipitated the resignation of Mr. Cardin, theMinister of Transport, because the repeal of the Section was not, in his view,&quot; in accordance with the attitude taken and the views expressed in the speeches and declarations solicitating an affirmative vote in the plebiscite.&quot;11. The economic position in Canada is a strong one, and Canada isenjoying a boom induced by war production, the momentum of which has not yetbeen overtaken by the scarcities and restrictions on private consumption whichare now so familiar a feature in the United Kingdom.12. The labour position is obscure. On the one hand there are acuteshortages of industrial and agricultural labour, and, at the same time, reportsof munition plants turning off large numbers of workers. Compulsory employ-ment of all unemployed men between the ages of 16 and 60 is being enforced.13. The increased demand for the employment of women in some branchesof industry is reported to be unpopular in Quebec., 14. Agitation continues for the release of persons interned because of theirsympathy with Communism; the release of Browder in the United Statesincreased the demands for similar releases in Canada. The Canadian Communistparty, however, still remains an illegal organisation.Service Notes.15. * With the opening of navigation in the Great Lakes and St. LawrenceRiver new construction ships which have been building during the winter monthsare being commissioned. Two corvettes have been accepted, two others have been commisioned and six Fairmile motor launches, laid up for the winter in the GreatLakes, have been recommissioned.16. All R.C.A.F. squadrons on the Home front, both Fighter and Bomber,with the exception of the two Army Co-operation Squadrons, were constantlyengaged in active offensive and defensive operations against the enemy.17. No. 413 Catalina Squadron and No. 417 Spitfire Squadron have beenposted overseas and no reports of their activities have yet been received.
18. No. 421 Squadron was formed with Spitfires early in April and-becameoperational in the middle of May : No. 415 Hampdens also became operational asTorpedo-bombers during the month.19.   No. 406 Beaufighters destroyed three German night raiders.20. No. 407 Hudsons celebrated its first anniversary on the 8th May. Tliissquadron has done great damage to enemy shipping during the period of its existence and three members of the Squadron were recently decorated, one withthe D.S.O. and two with D.F.Cs. Seven members of this Squadron have now received decorations.21.   Three R.C.A.F. bomber squadrons took part in the big Cologne raid.22. There - are two more R.C.A.F. squadrons in process of formation,Nos. 422 and 423, the former is to be equipped with Catalinas, the latter withSunderlands.23. No. 405 have changed over from Wellingtons to Halifax II aircraft.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.General Position.24. Throughout May, attention was persistently drawn by the Common-wealth to the importance of the Pacific theatre of war generally, and to theposition of Australia in particular. The fear that the United Kingdom Govern-ment are unaware of the dangers which face Australia coloured all war comment.For this reason, Dr. Evatts visit to London and Washington has been followedwith intense interest; and his speeches and broadcasts have, to a certain extent,alleviated the anxiety of Australians. It is widely felt that his visit is responsible for the fact that the United Kingdom Government are now thought to be more alive to the situation as it affects Australia. Articles in the localpress pointing out to Australians that it is only through the determination andresolution of the United Kingdom during the last two and a half years that australia still exists unharmed, have appeared, and the call for unlimited aid from the United Kingdom and the United States has drawn attention to the inadequacy of the Commonwealths own war effort. The condition of industry,in particular, in the New South Wales coalfields, evoked demands that criticismshould not be levelled at the United Kingdom for faults and failures which existalso within the Commonwealth,, and, in general, the tone of the press commenthas of late been much more favourable to the United Kingdom than it was for thetwo months following the fall of Singapore and the Netherlands East Indies.25. The Coral. Sea action was at first hailed as an outstanding Alliedvictory, but was later treated more cautiously as an indication of the wide disposi-tion of powerful Japanese forces in the Pacific.26. The struggle in Russia is still being followed keenly. Though it is admitted that Russia forms the immediate front to which aid must be sent, thereare constant reminders in the press that the Pacific theatre of war is equally important, and there is a fear that too much material -especially United Statesmaterial-^will be diverted to Russia at the expense of Australia. As regards other theatres of war, the loss of Burma was viewed as a matter of grave concern,and the effect of such a loss on China&apos;s resistance emphasised. The operation atMadagascar was generally welcomed.27. Mr. Curthfs announcement that clothing would shortly be rationed ledto extraordinary scenes of panic buying, which resulted in the closing of someretail stores owing to the exhaustion of their stocks. Police had to be brought into control the crowds. This behaviour was generally condemned, and there wascriticism of the Government for making the announcement prematurely. In fact,the shortage of various commodities is causing considerable agitation, and ageneral system of food rationing which would ensure equitable distribution wouldbe welcomed. The Minister of Supply has stated that any apprehension over food supplies is misplaced, as ample stocks of food will be available.28.   The strike in the New South Wales coalfields was the main item of domestic interest during the month, and&apos; much impatience was shown overMr. Curtin&apos;s announcement that he would compel the miners to go back, since[23990] B 2
he has made this statement many times already. The Melbourne Herald, alarmedat the repetition of acts such as strikes, which prevent Australia from wagingtotal war, commented that &quot;underlying all of them there appears to be an organised and coherent purpose to sabotage the war effort.&quot;29. Evidence of the general public dislike of mere party politics increases,especially as the controversy over the Government policy in regard to the DefenceAct is thought to be organised largely for political purposes. The law forbiddingthe Australian Militia Forces to fight outside Australia is recognised in some quarters as unreal, especially when Australians are clamouring for United states citizens to come to their aid&quot; in their struggle against the Japanese.Service Notes.30. H.M.A.S. Canberra, having completed refit at Sydney, arrived atMelbourne and has been working up.31. One minesweeper was commissioned and three launched for the royal australian Navy, in addition two minesweepers were commissioned for the RoyalIndian Navy.32. At the end of May there were more than 81,000 United States troopsin Australia, of whom about 81,000 were United States Army troops.33. Australian Army personnel serving in Australia now total nearly390,000, of whom about 110,500 belong to the Australian Imperial Force; nearly48,500 A.IF. are still serving overseas as well as about 5,000 in transit on their way back.Economic.34. A request was recently put forward by the Commonwealth Government,through Dr. Evatt, for an increase of 22^ per cent, in the price paid by the UnitedKingdom for Australian wool. After discussions between Dr. Evatt and theChancellor of the Exchequer, it was agreed that the price should be increased by15 per cent., beginning with the next wool clip. An announcement to this effect was made on the 23rd May and has had a very good reception in Australia.35. It was also announced that the United Kingdom Government were ready to make a corresponding adjustment in the prices paid by them for NewZealand and South African wool. The value of this concession to the threeDominions is likely to be of the order of  11-12 million a year.NEW ZEALAND,General Position.36. Attention has been docussed mainly on the South-West Pacific, anddoubts have been expressed whether the danger to Australia and New Zealandis sufficiently appreciated in London and Washington, and whether the South-West Pacific area is receiving its fair share of equipment. Dr. Evatt, who isregarded as the champion also of the New Zealand cause, is reported by the pressas having discovered an amazing state of ignorance of the realities of the Pacifictheatre of war. There has, however, been recognition in some sections of the many calls that are being made on Allied resources, and the Chief of the GeneralStaff said in a public speech: &quot;New Zealand is reaping her reward for not asking for the return of her forces in the Middle East, the equipment receivedbeing far in excess of all hopes.&quot; The New Zealand Government have consistentlyrefrained from any criticism of the United Kingdom and United States Govern-ments, and, in the latter part of May, the main newspapers gave much praise tothe United Kingdom war effort. A strict censorship is being applied to prevent any press comment which might cause offence in the United States from beingcabled overseas.37. The Battle of the Coral Sea was at first hailed triumphantly, following the line taken by the United States communique, but the Commonwealth PrimeMinister&apos;s cautious statement produced more restrained comment, and eventuallyit was generally considered that the battle was merely the prelude to a Japanesemove on a larger scale.
38. The Madagascar operation caused great satisfaction, and wasinterpreted as a sign of Allied willingness and &quot;ability to take the initiative.Elsewhere, Russia has been the main war interest. Press reports emphasised theRussian success in the Kharkov area, and commented on the sldwness of theGerman advance in the Kerch Peninsula.39. Mr. Churchill&apos;s speeches have been received with the usual enthusiasmand have called forth renewed statements of confidence in his leadership.40. The United Kingdom Government fuel rationing scheme was considered to have led to the first political crisis in the United Kingdom since the beginning;of the war, and the controversy aroused by it is interpreted as evidence that theParty truce is under severe strain.41. The main item of interest in New Zealand home politics has been the manifesto of the Returned Soldiers&apos; Association, which advocates the reorganisation -sation of the War Cabinet &quot; on a true national basis &apos;&apos; by the inclusion of&quot; menoutside Parliament. This is felt by the Opposition, however, to be no more acceptable than a Coalition Government, since there would be no exclusion of thepresent Labour Party Ministers, and the new members would be chosen by theLabour Prime Minister. These objections are recognised, but the Opposition hasbeen criticised for precipitating the rejection of a proposal which might be theopportunity for a new approach to political problems.Service Notes.42. Vice-Admiral Ghormley, United States Navy, arrived at Aucklandtowards the end of the month to take over command of the South Pacific Area :Rear-Admiral McCain, United States Navy, has assumed command of aircraft in this area.43. H.M.N.Z.S. Achilles and Leander were engaged with task forces in theSouth Pacific Area.44. A new anti-submarine/mine-sweeping vessel arrived at Auckland fromthe United Kingdom on the 2lst May; five more similar vessels are on their way from Greenock.45. The Army proposes a large increase in recruitment of women, princi-pally for signal units, static A.A. and coast defence artillery : the programmeprovides for an intake of 6,000 w^omen.46. Major-General Puttick, C.G.S., has been appointed General OfficerCommanding, New Zealand Army, with temporary rank of Lieutenant-General;he continues to retain his former position.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.General Position.47. The occupation of Madagascar, which, according to sections of theOpposition press, was &quot;not unexpected,&quot; was welcomed by almost every sectionof the community, and general relief was felt that the operation had been under-taken in time. It has been emphasised, however, that this is not the end of thewar for the Union, but a signal for an even more intensive effort. But thesuccessful occupation of a part of Madagascar has resulted in a relapse intocomplacency, coupled with a false sense of security. Opposition newspapers,secretly relieved over the action, nevertheless tried to whip the British by comparing the occupation with the British occupation of the Cape in 1795.Opposition criticism of General Smuts followed the usual line that the union was being turned into a battlefield as a result of his war policy. The question was raised whether Union Forces had been employed, and, if so, how this couldbe reconciled with the &quot; Africa Oath.&quot; Relief that Japanese occupation of the island had been forestalled, coupled with the consequent removal of immediatefear of attack on South Africa, however, easily outweighed petulant criticism onthe part of the Opposition.48. Of operations in other theatres of war, those in Russia received mostattention during May.   The loss of the Kerch Peninsula was regarded as
inevitable almost from the beginning of the German attack. Although some sections of the press expressed disillusionment with the &quot; British propagandanews service&quot; when it became clear that the Russian advance was halted, the battle in the Kharkov area was interpreted by Government newspapers as at thevery least a local setback for the Germans which would seriously reduce theirstriking power. Statements made by Ministers in the United Kingdom havebeen welcomed as clear indications that Germany will not be allowed peace inthe West.49. &quot; Empire Day,&apos;&quot;&apos; and Mr. Gandhi&apos;s recent statement, have been occasions-for outbursts by the Opposition press on the dislike felt by all Afrikaners forBritish rule. They profess to believe that force alone holds them within theBritish Empire, and that Gandhi&apos;s appeal to the British to retire from india would be underlined by every Afrikaner in relation to South Africa.50. A number of further acts of sabotage occurred in the Union during themonth, despite the confident assertion of the Minister of Justice that the country was well under control. Bomb explosions and dynamiting caused considerable damage and some casualties. More serious sabotage offences will be tried by aspecial Court set up under the Emergency Regulations, which provide for theimposition of the death penalty for such acts.51. The conflict over the question of the arming of non-Europeans (i.e.,natives) is increasing in importance, and most of the Afrikaner section of the.Union is violently against such a course. Dr. Malan and the Nationalists continueto use this issue to stir up race passions. Dr. Malan has firmly refused to cometo terms with other sections of the Opposition, and he has reopened his campaign against the Ossewa Brandwag-Pirow combination, which he accuses of playinginto the hands of &quot; British-Jewish Capitalism &quot; by dividing the votes againstthe Government, in the recent by-elections.52. The Governments failure to introduce a comprehensive system of food rationing is causing dissatisfaction. Widespread hoarding is intensifying theshortage of many commodities. The feeling is growing, among all sections ofthe public, that many members of the Cabinet are generally incompetent, andthat some are unequal to their task. Any Cabinet reconstruction is, however,likely to be postponed until after next year, when it is possible that a GeneralElection will take place.Service Notes.53. H.M.S. Pretoria was commissioned on 8th May as combined anti-submarine/mine-sweeper vessel; she is the first vessel of this type in SeawardDefence Eorce.54. Under a new scheme of reorganisation of the Union defences, the union is to be divided into an Inland Command and a Coastal Command; the latter being taken over by Major-General de Villiers, who recently commanded the2nd South African Division in the Middle East, and the Inland Command by major-General Brink, who formerly commanded the 1st South African Division.They will be succeeded in the command of their divisions by Major-GeneralKlopper and Major-General Pienaar respectively.55. A significant step towards a complete man-power survey of the Unionhas just been gazetted. It is a war measure by which commercial and industrialinstitutions must send in returns of their staff to the Director of Recruiting.These returns cover (a) The number of men and women who have enlisted;(b) The number who wish to enlist but have been unable to for variousspecified reasons;(6&apos;) The number who do not wish to enlist.56. Recruiting during the first fortnight of April declined from; the peakfigure reached in February and March. The European figures, both part-timeand full-time, reflected this, but the non-Europeans maintained their steadyaverages. It is thought, however, that this is a lull and that the figures will creepup again with a decisive propaganda lead.
57. The financial position remains very buoyant: the revised estimate ofrevenue for the current financial year ending the 30th June amounts to approxi-mately $23,000,000, a figure which may be&apos;compared with a revenue of approxi-mately- $9,500,000 during the first year of the Commission of Government -(1934-35). The expected surplus is about $6,700,000. The new found land government have so far lent to the United Kingdom Government in the form ofinterest-free loans a sum of $3,800,000, of which $700,000 has been obtained through the sale of War Savings Certificates. It is thought that a reduction ofrevenue must be expected during the next financial year owing to a probabledecrease in the volume of imports owing to increasing difficulties of supply and shipping. The provisional advance Estimates for 1943-44 provide for a surplusof $650,000, after allowing for a considerable expansion of expenditure for various war purposes.58. A large amount of work is still being provided on the United Statesand Canadian bases, with the result that further recruits for service overseas areat present difficult to obtain.EIRE.59. In an address to the Local Volunteer Force at University College,Dublin, on the 23rd May, Mr. de Valera took the opportunity to repeat hiswarning of the danger of invasion, which, he said, was likely to increase as time went on. &quot; If we are fully prepared, other countries who would make an attemptto attack us must count the cost, and it is necessary for us to see that that cost will be as high as possible. This country will not be free from danger until thewar is over.&quot;60. Introducing the Budget in the Dail on the 6th May, Mr. O&apos;Kelly, theMinister of Finance, said that there was a gap of  4,558,000 between expenditure and revenue, and that there was &quot; no means of closing it.&quot; Taxation would not do it, nor was it feasible by economies. If Eire abandoned its neutrality, thesupply position might be eased, but who would counsel that they should do so?Since the last year before the outbreak&apos;of war expenditure on the Army had increased five times to over  6 million. There would be no fresh taxation, director indirect, and no increase in income-tax or surtax.61. It was announced on the 18th May that further drastic restrictions onthe use of electricity would come into force. These include the prohibition ofroom heating, a cut of 50 per cent, in electricity used for water heating, and of25 per cent, in current used for lighting, and a reduction of 10 per cent, in electricity used for motive power. It was intimated that if these restrictions were not sufficient, heavier restrictions would follow, as &quot; the coal to provide theelectricity was not there.&quot;62. Mr. Lemass, speaking in the Dail on the 12th May, said that transport difficulties might cause hunger in some districts in Eire, since there might be difficulty in moving the harvest.63. Speaking in the renewed debate in the Dail on the Central Bank Bill,Mr. de Valera said that, if there were a way of shielding Eire from the repercussions of events, say, in Britain, the Central Bank would be able to do that better than anybody he could think of. Speaking of the expansion of credit in britain, Mr. de Valera said that he believed that the power the Bank of england had of suspending credit would reflect itself in Eire ultimately only so far as thebuying value of the English monetary unit in terms of goods was changed. Achange would reflect itself in higher prices in Britain and in a short time therewould be higher prices in Eire. The actions of the Bank of England inappreciating or depreciating the unit in England would have a similar effect in eire in changing the value of the Irish unit in terms of goods.

INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political Situation.64. No important political development occurred during May. It hasbecome increasingly clear that the breakdown of the constitutional negotiations in April was due fundamentally to the lack of will on the part of Congress eitherto take part in the active defence of India or to make the necessary compromisewith the minorities. &quot;Non-violent non-co-operation &quot; is the weapon offered by congress for meeting the invader, and they have given no support toKajagopalachariar&apos;s campaign in Madras for the united participation of congress and Moslem League in the defence of India. Gandhi&apos;s utterances become increasingly dangerous. He is harping on the theme that British and american forces and British officials must withdraw completely from India and thereby,as he professes to hope, remove the motive for Japanese aggression. He recognises that anarchy and chaos would follow the British withdrawal, but he would prefer that to the present state of India. There were signs at the end of May that hewas meditating some widespread campaign, possibly mass civil disobedience, to terminate &quot; foreign domination,&quot; but it is not yet clear whether Nehru and otherCongress leaders are prepared to support such a plan.65. There is, in fact, widespread dissatisfaction with the sterile policy of congress. Student, left-wing and peasant organisations are beginning to adopta pro-war line, and there are signs of support for the war effort from the moslem league, the Hindu Mahasabha and the Sikhs. There is more active participation in A.R.P. measures, and there has been a distinct recovery in morale generally,which favourably impressed the Viceroy when in the middle of May he paid aflying visit to Madras, Vizagapatam and Calcutta.66. The flow of refugees from Burma along the difficult land routes intoIndia has continued throughout the month and has put a great strain on theofficial and non-official organisations which have been assisting them, but there is reason to believe that a most difficult problem is now, on the whole, in course ofbeing brought under control successfully.67. Internally, the country generally has been quiet, with the exception ofan area in Sind where the Hurs, a criminal tribe and followers of a local Moslemreligious leader, the Pir Pagaro (who was placed under detention last October),have committed a series of outrages against life and property. Military measures,which include the application of martial law to a large tract of Sind, have been undertaken to stamp out the trouble.Indian States.68. As the result of air raids the civil administration of Manipur, a Stateadjoining Assam and Burma, broke down, and the Maharaja and his Darbardisappeared, but British officials, including those assisting the stream of refugees from Burma, helped to restore order. Elsewhere, as in British India, a general improvement in morale has been noted, side by side with local manifestations ofnervousness and alarm.Foreign and, Frontier Relations.69. (a) Afghanistan. His Majesty&apos;s Minister reported a great improve-ment in his relations with the Afghan Government during the last two months.The question of reopening a Polish Legation in Kabul was discussed with theForeign Minister, who said that, while the Afghan Government had thefriendliest feelings for the Polish Government, they regretted that it was notpossible during the war to agree to a Polish Legation. The Foreign Minister,however, undertook to see that any representations which Sir Francis Wyliemight have occasion to make on their behalf would receive as much attention asif they had been made by a properly accredited Polish Minister. A protest wasmade to the Afghan Government in regard to the participation by Afghangangsters in hostile activities in Waziristan.
(b) North-West Frontier. In North Waziristan gangs which number about600 and consist of constituents of all tribes with a considerable element ofAfghans, have been giving considerable trouble near Datta Khel in the UpperToehi area, In the absence of local support they have been obtaining supplies from Afghanistan. Communication with the Datta Khel scout post has been cut by road blocks and the post is intermittently shelled. In an engagement wTitha scout patrol on the 12th May, the hostiles were armed with at least one Vickers-Berthier gun; one of our supporting aeroplanes crashed and the pilot died of hisinjuries, though his gunner was rescued by scouts. A blockade of the MaddaKhel and two other tribes, from whom the hostiles were obtaining food supplies,was declared on the 14th May. Two Hindus w-ere kidnapped in the Bannu districtby hostiles, wTho, however, sustained several casualties. Elsewhere &quot;the frontierremains quiet.A successful move to transfer the Kohat Pass tribal arms factories to british territory has resulted in the setting up of four factories employing 325 men inPeshawar. Only a small percentage of&quot; workmen employed in the pass factoriesstill remain there. The factories in Peshawar produced 339 rifles up to the endof last month, which are being used to arm the police forces.(c) Persian Gulf. The Sheikh of KuwaiCs progress towards recovery hasbeen satisfactory, although there will always be a danger of a second attack/(d) Russia.- The Government of India have agreed to receive in India arepresentative of the Soviet Tass Agency.(e) Tibet. A further attempt to persuade the Tibetan Government to permit the passage of supplies to China proved unsuccessful owing to their fear ofthereby becoming involved in the war. In view of the importance for psycholo-psychological  reasons of doing everything possible to open up routes to China, theGovernment of India propose to act in co-operation with the Chinese to put pressure on the Tibetans to agree, even though this may mean the abandonment ofour long-standing and valuable policy of supporting the maintenance of Tibefsautonomy against other Powers, in particular the Chinese. As a first step it isproposed to send up Sir Basil Gould, who is persona grata to the Tibetans, toLhasa to speak plainly to them, and to act in full co-operation with the Chineserepresentative. If Tibetan obstruction persists, it may become necessary to resort to some form of sanctions, e.g., the prevention of the import of Chinesebrick tea or refusal to allow the export of Tibetan wool.Economic.70. A number of tropical products are now in short supply, with the resultthat there is an increased demand upon India for those of them which she is ahleto provide. This has led to competition between the various would-be purchasersand to a consequent rise in prices. To meet this position schemes are in course ofbeing worked out to substitute public for private purchase and for co-operationbetween the various buyers. Commodities which are affected in this way includeshellac, tea, bristles, jute and jute goods, cotton, silk and mica.71. Purchase on public account tends to put the smaller trader out ofbusiness and this feature is most unwelcome to the Government of India, but itseems that short supply, especially when coupled writh transport difficulties, leadsinevitably to co-ordinated buying, and that the latter involves public purchasesooner or later. The Combined Raw Materials Board in Washington is beginning to take a hand.Finance.72.   Nothing to report.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.73. Royal Indian Navy. One anti-submarine corvette recently completed in United Kingdom was due to sail to Eastern waters at the end of May andanother in June.74. One corvette was due to be commissioned on the 29th May and anotheron the 17th June. The officers and crews for these ships are sent home from Indiato take over and commission them.[23990]c
75. Army. In view of the Japanese occupation of Burma and the conse-quent threat to North-East India the Eastern Army has been organised into twoCorps one in Assam and the other in the Calcutta area. Certain troop move-ments into Assam have taken place and our forces are now holding positionsnear the Assam-Burma frontier. Owing to poor communications in North-EastIndia, it takes about seven weeks to move a brigade from Orissa to the Assamfrontier approximately 600 miles as the crow flies. The 17th Indian division and the Burma Division are now being reorganized in the Manipur area.Approximately 10,000 guerrillas are being raised under Army auspices in North-Eastern India.76. Indian Armoured Corps. The situation regarding Armoured divisions in India is as follows :  One Armoured Division (less one Brigade already in Iraq), and oneArmy Tank Brigade to be ready for an operational role by August 1942.Second Armoured Division to be ready by October 1942. It is hoped thata third Armoured Division will be raised and available by early in 1943.The above programme is subject to variation in consequence of shipping-losses or delays.77. Indian States Forces. All Indian States Forces were placed at thedisposal of the King-Emperor on the outbreak of war, and the great bulk of these forces are taking an active part in the war effort. Units have been classified inthe following categories and a number of units placed in the first category are serving overseas : I. Field Service Units. For employment overseas or in the Field Army inIndia.II. General Service Units. For employment in British India for garrisonor internal security duties.III. State Service Units. Retained in the States as their standard oftraining and equipment does not at present permit their being employed elsewhere.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Military.78. The Japanese have virtually completed their occupation of Burma.Our forces successfully withdrew up the Chindwin Valley and have crossed intoAssam without undue loss.79. About 30,000 troops are now reorganising in the Imphal area. Thewithdrawal was not pressed after Kalewa, but the bulk of our transport, A.FVs.and guns had to be abandoned East of the Chindwin. The personnel of the burma Army and Burma Frontier Force which is included among the troopswithdrawn into India will be reformed into Burma units under the general administration of the Burma Government and the operational control of theCommander-in-Chief.80. While some 6,000 Chinese troops have returned westwards to link up with our forces on the Indian frontier, the bulk are finding their way back intoYunnan.General.81. On the 2nd May Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith received instructions atMyitkyina that he should leave Burma when he felt that his presence there would no longer serve any useful purpose. He left for India by air on the 4th May.His Premier and Finance Ministers had preceded him. The Government of burma is setting up offices at Simla to deal with those questions, chiefly financial or relating to the civil services or the administration of the Burma Army andFrontier Force, on which they can still function. A number of European officials and other civilians have been successfully evacuated.   Others are still making
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &apos;1 Colonies &apos;&apos; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)(i) Economic Affairs.West A frica: Produce Board.84. The West African Cocoa Control Board, which has successfully dealtwith the problem of surplus cocoa production in West Africa, is being reconsti-tuted as the West African Produce Control Board, and it is intended that itshould take over the purchase and marketing of palm products (palm oil andkernels) and such other products as may be deemed desirable from time to time.It is expected that it will thus be possible to introduce a greater measure ofco-ordination and flexibility into the buying and movement of these products, andto facilitate the solution of various difficult price and supply problems that arise as a result of the drive for increased production in West Africa.Programme of Shipping and Supply.85. It has been decided to introduce for British West Africa a system ofshipping programmes not unlike that already in force for the Middle East. It ishoped that this system, which should be in operation by July, will greatly help to ensure that essential cargoes of all sorts destined for British West Africa donot fail to arrive through lack of proper shipping arrangements. As stated inthe last report, consideration is also being given to instituting a shippingprogramme for East Africa,Oilseeds.86. Purchase arrangements have been completed for the Fiji output, and arein train as regards Ceylon and East Africa. Shipping difficulties are serious inthe case of Ceylon, and there have been some differences of opinion in East africa as regards The best machinery of purchase. Discussions on this point have been proceeding in Cairo, since the great bulk of the output of East Africa will go tothat destination.Cotton.87. It is hoped that the Government of India may be willing to participate in joint purchase arrangements covering East Africa, which normally sells muchcotton to India and which has suffered through disturbances in the Bombaymarket.Control of Cost of Living.88.   Measures are in hand in the West Indies, and are under discussion asregards other territories, to supplement the existing control of price-fixing&apos; by arrangements for the bulk purchase of essential requirements and their resale, if[23990] - D*their way into India from Burma across the hills. The Governments of Bengaland Assam have been giving all possible assistance by establishing camps andsupplying food along the routes. A large proportion of the Indian refugeepopulation has been evacuated.82. Little information is available as to conditions in Burma, Tokyobroadcasts have stated that certain prominent persons, including the remainingMinisters, had placed themselves under the protection of the Japanese Army (theGovernor reports that the persons named had interested themselves in the protec-tion of wealthy Burmese refugees from mob violence), and that the rulers in theShan States have promised loyalty and co-operation to the Japanese.83. The ex-Premier of Burma, U Saw, was transferred at the end of Aprilfrom Palestine to Bombo, Uganda, where he is interned under suitable conditions.
necessary, below the cost of acquisition. The more difficult question of dealingwith necessities not susceptible to this treatment has also been receivingattention.Colonial Products Research.89. It has been decided to set up a Colonial Products Research Council,with funds provided under the C-T). and W. Act, 1940. It is hoped that theCouncil will facilitate the performance of work both of direct and immediatebenefit to the war effort, and also, as its main purpose, of lasting value to Colonialpeoples and to their contribution to world trade.(ii) Defence.Man-power.90. The provision of additional numbers of non-Europeans for service in non--fighting capacities in the Middle East Command has been further considered in consultation with the War Office and the Deputy Adjutant-General, middle east. The net requirements of General Headquarters, Middle East, are approxi-mately 100,000 after allowing for units already being raised for the Middle Eastin East and West Africa. It has been decided, in the light of estimates receivedfrom Colonial Governments of the potential man-power available in the variousAfrican Territories, to ask West Africa to contribute 60,000 and East Africa40,000 towards this total. The allocation of these target figures as between thevarious African Dependencies which can contribute towards them is being leftto the West and East African Governors&apos; Conferences respectively. Methods of recruitment, whether by conscription or on a voluntary basis, will be decided by individual Governments.Civil Defence.91. As the result of their examination of the first batch of the monthlyreports now made by the Governments of those Colonies most exposed to attack,the Colonial Office Civil Defence Committee have formed the opinion that the fire-fighting arrangements in some Colonies are not entirely satisfactory incertain respects. The Colonial Governments concerned are being advised on thesematters and steps are being taken with a view to making good as quickly aspossible any deficiencies of fire-fighting equipment.Fiji and Tonga.92. The United States Authorities have requested the agreement of HisMajesty&apos;s Governments in the United Kingdom and New Zealand to theirassuming responsibility for the defence of Fiji and Tonga. This responsibilityhas hitherto been exercised by New Zealand. As Fiji and Tonga are in theUnited States strategic area and United States forces are being sent there, bothBritish Governments concerned have agreed to the United States request.93. The Americans have suggested that the terms and conditions on whichthey exercise responsibility should be governed by reference to the West IndiesBases Agreements, so far as these are applicable and subject to local variationsfound necessary and agreed between the Governor and the United StatesCommander. The Bases Agreements are, however, unnecessarily complicated forconditions in Fiji and Tonga and not very suitable for a purely war-time agree-ment. It is proposed, therefore, if the New Zealand and Fiji Governments agree,to make a counter-proposal to the Americans that the terms and conditions onwhich they exercise their defence responsibility should be generally similar tothose under which New Zealand has hitherto exercised the responsibility as laiddown by the New Zealand-Fiji Defence Agreement, subject to any modificationsagreed between the Governor and the United States Commander.&apos;British Solomon Islands Protectorate.94. In the early part of May Japanese naval forces were reported to be operating in the Tulagi area. The Australian Infantry Detachment and royal australian Air Force unit had previously been withdrawn. A large concentra-tion of enemy warships, including three cruisers, were reported to be in TulagiHarbour, but left within the next few days.   Bombing attacks have been made
by Allied planes. The Japanese have landed in a number of islands, and it was reported on the 17th May that they had established anti-aircraft batteries and oil dumps in several of the islands; also that six enemy flying boats based onTulagi were carrying out continuous reconnaissance.95. A few Europeans (including some Government officers) as well asChinese are still in the Protectorate. The Resident Commissioner has establishedhis headquarters in the most south-westerly island of the group. The HighCommissioner, who has authority to order the withdrawal of Government officerswhen no further purpose can be served by their remaining, has been asked forparticulars regarding the numbers and whereabouts of other Europeans and chinese, and whether they have boats available.96. The Japanese are reported to be spreading propaganda among the natives and endeavouring (in some cases successfully) to win over prominentnatives.Reports on Individual Colonies.Palestine.97. The only indication of political activity on the part of the Arabs hasbeen unimportant private discussions on the possibility of Arab political revivalin Palestine by a few individuals formerly prominent m local politics. They are mostly members of the Istiqlal party. So far they have failed to devise anyprogramme or formula.98. The main activities of Jewish official organisations continue to bedirected towards furthering enlistment of Jewrs in the armed forces and theestablishment of a local Jewish Defence Force. Opposition to the manner inwhich the Zionist leaders are directing Jewish affairs, mentioned in the reportfor the month of April, has crystallised in the formation of yet another political party. Promoters are Liberals of Central European origin, and they aim atobtaining the support of the majority of Central European Jews. The main points in programme are : (1) Greater support for Britain in the war effort.(2) Close co-operation in external and internal policy with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the democracies.(3) Abandonment of more chauvinistic Jewish aims and greater co-operationwith other communities in Palestine.(4) Fair representation in Jewish official bodies.. 99. The Government scheme for control of cereal crops has progressedsatisfactorily and without opposition. This, and other measures connected withfood supply, continue to have the support of the press and public. There hasbeen general fall in prices, partly seasonal, partly because would-be profiteersare rattled by prospects of further Government action.100. Trans-Jordan remains normal. The high Commissioner visited the amir on his return and found His Highness in very good heart.Ceylon.101. The labour situation was reported as &quot;normal&quot; on 15th May.Conditions at Colombo Harbour showed a noticeable improvement that appeared likely to continue, and difficulties in the handling of cargo, arising fromthe abscondment of skilled lightermen after the air raid of 5th April, arebeing overcome as new men are trained. All port labour is being registered and given a guaranteed basic wage in order to secure the maintenance of essential services.102. As regards other classes of the community, the Governor has reportedthat the intelligentsia, though not uncritical of British administration or defeatsin the Far East, realise the disastrous results of a Japanese victory for them-selves, and will gratefully collaborate with regular Forces in defence of the Island.The peasantry, though instructed to &quot; stay put,&quot; are likely to panic under attack.103. The rice situation can only be described as unsatisfactory. The Govern-nient of India promised to permit the export to Ceylon, through trade channels,of 38,000 tons monthly, mainly from Karachi and Madras, but these figures have
not been fulfilled, as stocks at Karachi are low and purchase in Madras is not satisfactory. The Government of India have been asked to vary present arrange-ments to permit of delivery of 30.000 tons a month, if necessary by directpurchase.   Existing stocks are estimated to last until beginning of August.Gold Coast.104. Approval has been given for the appointment of one or two Africansto the Administrative Service in the Gold Coast. This is of importance as an example of the steps that are being taken to weld together Africans and europeans in the Administrative machine.105. In April a certain M. Beretta was appointed by the Free French,without the consent of the British authorities, to the Free French Mission inthe Gold Coast. Ostensibly he was to look after the interests of Africans crossinginto that Colony from Vichy territory, but, according to His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General in Brazzaville, he also had secret instructions to examine the possibilitiesof forming armed bands, which might make raids into the Ivory Coast andDahomey. To avoid any danger of this M. Beretta was informed on arrival atAccra, on instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government, that he would have to confine himself to looking after Africans from Vichy territory seeking asylumin the Gold Coast and must not engage in any subversive activities. It is still under consideration whether M. Beretta should be allowed to remain in the gold coast, and in any case if he commits the slightest indiscretion an immediaterequest for his removal will be made to the Free French authorities.Gambia.106. Special attention is being paid to local food production, with referencenot only to difficulties in regard to the shipping of imports, but also to the largetemporary increase in population under war service conditions.107. A programme of road construction is being carried out in accordancewith military requirements, and the public works staff is being strengthened forthis purpose.108. The construction of a deep-water quay at Bathurst, in the Gambia,has been approved in principle. The work is to be undertaken by a MilitaryConstruction Unit.West Indies.109. Following the meeting of the Anglo-United States CaribbeanCommission in Trinidad in April, a joint food and shipping conference was heldin Jamaica in the middle of May between the officers of the British and AmericanCaribbean Colonies to discuss co-ordination of food supplies and shipping.Representatives of the Colonial Office and Mr. Wilgress. of the Canadian Govern-ment, were also present. A number of detailed arrangements for co-ordinationwere made and it is proposed that an organisation should be set up in Washingtonattached to the Office of Colonial Supply Liaison for the bulk purchase of food-stuffs on behalf of the West Indian Governments.110. A further meeting of the Commission itself took place in Washingtonat the end of the month, but no report of its conclusions has yet been received.
