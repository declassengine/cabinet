THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (R) (42) 49.December 28, 1942.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER 1942 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.General Position.1. Public attention during November has naturally been fixed chiefly onthe events in North Africa, and a strong interest has been shown in the reper-eussions of these events on French affairs. An almost morbid anxiety to refrain from over-optimism, in case of later disappointments, which characterisedcomment during the earlier part of the operations, gave place to great satisfactionand elation as the successful progress of both the 1st and 8th Armies was maintained. Comment on the United States campaign in the Solomon Islandshas followed a similar curve, moving from caution at the beginning of the month to increased confidence.2. Sympathy with General de Gaulle and the Fighting French, andsatisfaction at the severance of relations with Vichy are widespread. opinion has crystallised against Petain, and the necessity of the Allies&apos; dealings withDarlan has been viewed askance and with no little apprehension. PresidentRoosevelfs statement that agreement with him was a purely military and temporary matter was hailed with general relief. There is an almost universalsympathy with the French people, as distinct from their leaders, and confidence in French pro-Ally sentiment as a whole.3. The scorn with which Italy has lately been regarded is now giving place to some sympathy with her as Hitler&apos;s victim.4. Statements by Mr. Mitchell, the Canadian Minister of Labour, made onhis return from the United Kingdom, and Mr. Morrison&apos;s speech on the productivity of British war workers, have evoked tributes to the industrial war effort by the United Kingdom.Considerable interest has been shown in the first press reports of Sir william beveridge&apos;s proposals, and the United Kingdom has been given credit for thedetermined spirit in which matters of social reform are being investigated.Mr. Willkie came in for much adverse criticism after his speech at theHerald-Tribune forum, and his personal stock suffered a fall, but his laterspeeches, stressing the part the British Empire has played in the struggle,mollified the press critics.5. The United States elections aroused a good deal of interest. president roosevelt is very popular with the Canadian press as a whole, and Republicangains were viewed with misgiving. Interest has also been shown in theconscription issue in Australia, and in the relations of General MacArthur withthe Commonwealth authorities.[24802] .        B
(i. Major-General Odium, until recently Canadian High Commissioner inAustralia/has been appointed Canadian Minister to China. Mr. W.Chipman, K.C., becomes the first Canadian Minister to Chile.7. The influence of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party inCanada is growing, but there was little popular support for a proposal put bythe party to Mr. Mackenzie King, that Canada should take the initiative in pressing for the reopening of negotiations with India.8. Certain sections of the press have strongly opposed the new InternationalTin Agreement, which, it lias been claimed, is contrary to the terms of the atlantic Charter.9. There is still much unrest among the trade unions, and the canadian government have taken an unprecedented step in assuming control of the NationalSteel Car Corporation^ plant. The plant, which is making Lancaster bomberframes, is a long way behind its schedule. The workers had protested publiclyseveral times against the management, hitherto without result.10. Mr. Howe&apos;s appointment as a member of the Combined Production and resources Board in Washington has been welcomed as evidence of Canada&apos;sincreased world prestige and of her importance as a producer of war materials and munitions.11. The Victory Loan, which was launched on. the 19th October, with an objective of 8750,000,000, succeeded in raising 8970,000,000 in three weeks.12. The cost of living index remains fairly steady, and it can be said thatthe relative stability which it has shown since the introduction of a price ceilinga year ago is a tribute to the success of that policy.13. The resignation of the Premiership of Ontario by Mr. Hepburn, andhis replacement by Air. Conant, continue to provide speculations on Mr. Hepburn&apos;snext move. He is generally credited with plans for a spectacular return to powrerin the near future.Naval, Military and A ir A ctiviti.es.14. With the arrival in England of the 4th Canadian Armoured Divisionit was decided that a further Army Co-operation squadron should be allocated tothe Canadian forces. The three Canadian squadrons will be controlled by a newCanadian Army Co-operation Wing.15.. R.C.A.F. fighter squadrons accounted for one German fighter and several locomotives in occupied territory. The three night-fighter squadronshad no particular incidents to report. With regard to bomber squadrons,405 Squadron (Halifax aircraft) was lent to Coastal Command for anti-submarinework over the Bay of Biscay. No. 408 having recently changed over to Halifaxbombers was engaged&apos; in conversion training and therefore non-operational.No. 419 Wellington squadron raided Germany twice by daylight, but towards theend of the month was also withdrawn from operations for conversion toHali faxes. The other two R.C.A.F. bomber squadrons were regularly employedin night raids both over Germany and Italy. The Hudson squadron, No. 407,was used against shipping in the Bay of Biscay. On one occasion three of itsaircraft were attacked by three German float-planes, one of which was destroyed and the other two badly damaged : the three Hudsons all reached home safely,although damaged. No. 415 squadron, equipped with Hampden torpedo bombers,was also employed against enemy shipping in the Bay of Biscay, and on occasionsits aircraft attacked ships as far afield as the mouth of the Gironde.16. Five.new R.C.A.F. bomber squadrons, all equipped with Wellington Ills,were formed during the month and numbered 424 and 426 to 429 inclusive.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.General Position.17. For the first time for many months the main interest of the public hasbeen in a theatre of war other than the Pacific. News of the Allied landings in french North Africa was welcomed with enthusiasm, and the successful advanceof the 8th Army called forth tributes to British generalship which, subject asit has been during past reverses to adverse criticism, is now held to have been
amply vindicated. The dominant part played by United Kingdom troops andequipment has been duly recognised, though certain sections of the press haveshown a tendency to magnify Australian participation in the success of the eighth Army, and have even gone so far as to give Australia credit for anindirect contribution to the French North African operations owing to heragreement to forgo supplies intended for Australia.18. Sympathy for the problems facing the French nation as a whole hasbeen evident, but condemnation of Vichy has been general. Negotiations withDarlan have been viewed with uneasiness and distaste, but the United states policy, both previously, in maintaining relations with Vichy, and lately, in accepting Darlan&apos;s co-operation, is held to have been, on the whole, justified by events, and in this connexion President Roosevelt&apos;s statement was reassuring.In its anxiety to justify United States policy of co-operation with Darlan, the daily Mirror stated that General de gaulle&apos;s National Committee did not appealto Frenchmen, and that the General made a mistake in aspiring to be not onlythe military, but also the political leader of the French.19. The situation in Russia has given rise to increasing confidence in the ability of the Soviet Forces to maintain their magnificent resistance, but theNorth African operations by the British and American Forces are regarded as acomplete answer to alleged Russian dissatisfaction with the British and Americanwar effort, and also to those who have been pressing for an immediate openingof a &quot;second front.&quot;20. The American successes in the Pacific have naturally given rise to muchsatisfaction. Towards the end of November, however, the now familiar cry that,in so far as the Commonwealth was concerned, it was the war in the Pacific thatreally mattered, and that Australia was once more in danger of being neglected,was again heard.21. Mr. Morrison&apos;s October speech provoked discussion of the British war effort, and generous tributes were paid to United Kingdom achievements. In sofar as the United Kingdom Prime Minister is concerned, he has been given credit for the recent satisfactory developments in North Africa, and his prestige inAustralia is very high.22. Mr. Wendell Willkie&apos;s criticisms of the Empire were resented inAustralia, and in this connexion it is suggested that United Kingdom propaganda is dull and ineffective, harping always.on &quot; production,&quot; and failing to proclaimthe heroic and inspiring deeds of the front-line troops. The Sydney Bulletin,for instance, asked why the &quot; really great story of the convoys to Russia &quot; hadnot been told, and felt that even the heroic story of Malta was vague and obscure.&quot; If John Bull were not such a notoriously bad hand at booming himself, hecould silence disloyal complaints with a good blast or two.&quot;23. In home affairs, the launching of the new war loan evoked the press comment that the voluntary system was on its last trial, and that, if the loanwere unsuccessful, compulsion would be the Governments only alternative. Infact the loan appears likely to be subscribed, though the press has commented onthe reluctance of the small subscriber to take part.24. It will be recalled that a constitutional change of considerable importance to the future relations of Commonwealth and States was fore-shadowed by the introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament oh the1st October of a Bill to amend the Commonwealth Constitution so as to give theCommonwealth Government exclusive powers over &quot; war aims and post-war reconstruction.&quot; The Convention which was appointed to discuss this Billrejected it, but adopted the alternative of uniform legislation by all StateParliaments, by which certain important powers are to be delegated to theFederal Government for a period of five years after the conclusion of hostilities.These cover measures for dealing with the reinstatement of ex-members of theforces and dependants of the dead and disabled, employment, and organisedmarketing.25. In the Labour Party a crisis is developing over the proposed mergingof the Australian Imperial Forces and the Australian Militia Forces. The press,as a whole, realises the necessity of the merger, and backs Mr. Curtin&apos;s proposal.&apos;Previous reports have indicated the reluctance of the present labour government in the Commonwealth to take action to prevent strikes in industry,but Dr. Evatt is now reported to be taking a strong line in order to prevent[2480?^ B 5
hindrances in the war effort by the reduction in the output of coal due to thesestrikes. The Labour situation continues to be bad, despite the Governmentsattempts to bring about an improvement.26. The immediate establishment of a contributory employment insurancescheme has been urged by the Sydney Morning Herald.Naval, Military and Air Activities.27. 1T.M.A.S. Manoora was paid off into reserve at the end of October foruse as an Assault Ship.28. Military: Land operations: New Guinea. Australian units aftercrossing the Owen Stanley Range occupied Kokoda on the 2nd November. Bythe 13th November the Kumusi River crossing at Wairope had been secured afterheavy fighting in the Oivi-Gorari area, during which 900 Japanese were killed.The Australian Forces were then directed against Gona and Sanananda. Mean-while, a United States Army Force which had been transported by air to a concentration area South-East of Buna advanced on that place securing CapeEndaiadere by the 22nd November.29. By the 28th November the enemy was in control of only a narrowcoastal strip from Buna to Gona and was resisting strongly with well-placedmachine-guns, mortar and light artilleiy. Allied Forces gradually reduced theground held by the enemy, who suffered heavy casualties. Our troops were wellsupported from the air and by some 25-pounder field guns which had beentransported by air from Moresby.30. Australia. A further, stage has been reached in the reorganisation of 1st Australian Armoured Division and 1st and 2nd Motor Divisions as threeArmoured Divisions on the Middle East pattern.The present position is as follows :- (A) 1st Australian Armoured Division. This Division is being concentrated in Western Australia; its Motor Brigade is already there. the armoured Briga.de portion and Divisional troops are in process of moving from New South Wales to Western Australia by rail and road.(B) 2nd Australian Armoured Division. This Division will be concentrated in New South Wales. Its Armoured Brigade and Divisional troops are at present located in Victoria and will move to New South Wales.Units comprising the Motor Brigade of this Division are already in new South Wales.(C) 3rd Australian Armoured Division. This Division will be concentrated in Queensland. Its Armoured Brigade, formerly part of the original1st Australian Armoured Division is to move by rail and road fromNarrabri, New South Wales, to Queensland. The Motor Brigadeis already in Queensland and the Units comprising Divisional troops are in process of moving from New South Wales to Queensland.31. Air Operations. A total of 66 Allied air attacks embracing 270 sortieswas made on enemy-occupied territories. All these attacks were by R.A.A.F.aircraft and do not include United States attacks. In these attacks 545 tonsof bombs were dropped in addition to extensive shooting up of enemy groundinstallations and troops.32, In the North-Eastern area, attacks were divided between enemy shipping in the Rabaul, Buin-Faisi and Ffuon Gulf areas and enemy-occupiedaerodromes, installations and troops on the mainland of New Guinea Island, NewBritain and New Ireland.33. The attacks on shipping were successful, resulting in the sinking of destroyers, transport and cargo vessels.34. The attacks on ground installations, including aerodromes, were alsosuccessful, particularly in the confined Buna-Gona area, where enemy troops hadretreated owing to the successful land activities of the Australian troops in theirdrive from Kokoda to Buna-Gona area,35. Beaufighters and Bostons were primarily used in the low-level shootingand bombing attacks in these areas.36. In the North-Western area attacks were made by R.A.A.F. Ffudsonsand Beaufighters on enemy installations in 14 areas in Portuguese Timor and-?ih Penfoei aerodrome at Koepang in Dutch Timor.
37. Enemy air activity in the Lae-Salamaua area considerably increased in the latter half of the month, their fighter and bomber strength in this areanow being considerable.38. Six enemy air attacks were made against Allied aerodromes duringthe month; three upon Port Moresby, one upon Milne Bay and two upon Darwin.All these attacks were made in the early hours of the morning and very slight damage of a temporary nature was the only result.NEW ZEALAND.General Position.39. The recent operations in North Africa are considered as the fulfilment of the &quot; second front &quot; pledge to Russia, and United Kingdom troops and leader-ship have all been given praise for the successes in Africa. Tributes have alsobeen paid to the performances of the New Zealand division. There is strong-dislike of the Allied dealings with Darlan, who is generally regarded as anunprincipled traitor, and there are fears of the effects of the dealings with himon the Fighting French. It has, for instance, been noted as a setback to theircause, that they were given no part in the North African operations. Thescuttling of the French fleet at Toulon has been taken as an augury of theresurgence of the French spirit.40. Earlier misgivings about United States naval strength in the Pacificgave place during the month to high excitement at the news of the United states naval victory, and for a time even the sensational African news took second place.The New Zealand press, however, does not share Australian and United Statesoptimism regarding the prospects in the Pacific, and considers that the positioncannot be stabilised with the strictly limited Allied forces which are at present available. There is some criticism at the continued separation of the South-west and South Pacific commands, coupled with tacit satisfaction at the replacement of Admiral Ghormley.41. Tribute has been paid to the United Kingdom war effort, the daily herald expressing regret for the British tendency to understatement, which was thought to be misleading to overseas opinion.The Colonial system has been the subject of comment in the Christchurchpress, which stated that &quot; Japanese success was mainly due to the fact that thearea of Japanese conquests was an area in which the native people were under a colonial Government, towards which they -felt no strong tie of affection orloyalty.&quot;42. Further discussion of the man-power situation in New Zealand hasturned on the question whether the Dominion&apos;s commitments for the militaryforces are not excessive, and likely to react adversely on production. A campaignhas been in progress for the recall of the New Zealand division from the middle east, which it is feared may become involved in the struggle on the Europeanmainland, when it should be more properly employed in the Pacific against theJapanese, bearing in mind that the demand for men from the Commonwealth ofAustralia and New Zealand, for the war in the Pacific, may continue after theend of the war in Europe.43. The placing of New Zealand forces under United States command hasbeen accepted as a logical and necessary development. The view that it is better for New Zealanders to fight overseas in the Pacific, rather than await invasion athome, is general.44. A Bill has been passed to prolong the life of the present Parliament for another year.45. The New Zealand Government has withdrawn its recognition of the vichy Consul.Naval, Military and A ir A activities.46.   H.M.N.Z.S. Achilles completed refit at Auckland.Satisfactory progress is being made with the development of defences andshore facilities at the main ports; boom defences are in operation at Auckland;anti-torpedo nets have been received for Wellington and Lyttleton.
47. Part of the 3rd New Zealand Division has arrived in Noumea, thebalance is being despatched as shipping permits; this Division will eventually be supplemented by an armoured regiment, complete with tanks, from New Zealand.48. It has been decided to assist Fiji in expanding the local Defence force by sending 58 Officers and 250 Other Ranks from New Zealand; equipment willalso be sent and will be replaced later from the United Kingdom.49.   Middle East: At the very beginning of the month, on the night of the1st/2nd, the 2nd New Zealand Division again carried out an attack on the ElAlamein position, this time in conjunction with two United Kingdom infantry brigades, and succeeded in forcing a gap through which were passed twoarmoured car regiments, one United Kingdom and one South African.   In spiteof heavy Axis counter-attacks next day the gap was kept open, and by dawn on 3rd our armour started passing through.   It was then fiercely counter-attacked bythe Axis armour, chiefly German, and a violent tank battle raged all day, as aresult of which towards afternoon the first signs of an enemy withdrawal werenoticed.   The following day the 10th Corps passed through the gap into the open in full pursuit, with the New Zealanders directed upon Fuka, which wasreached on 5th.  Here the 2nd New Zealand Division found the escarpment heldby the remnants of the German .90th Light Division and the 15th and 21stPanzer Divisions, and vigorously attacked them, forcing the enemy to withdraw.Unfortunately, rain then intervened and slowed up the pursuit; nevertheless,by the 9th the New Zealand Division was in the Sidi Rarrani area and in actionagainst enemy rear guards at Maktila,   The following day the 2nd New Zealand division cleared Sidi Barrani and was in action at Buq Buq.   On the 11th theyjoined up with the 7th Armoured Division at Capuzzo, and together cleared theHalfaya pass, capturing many prisoners.   The following day Sollum and Bardiawere taken, together wdth more Italian prisoners.   By this time the 2nd NewZealand Division had in nine days advanced about 250 miles as the crow fliesin spite of delay caused by a short spell of bad weather.   From now7 onwards the pursuit was continued by smaller formations of more mobile troops, and the NewZealand Division remained in the vicinity of the frontier until the end of themonth.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.General Position.50. The successful operations in North Africa have given rise to great satisfaction and optimism amongst supporters of the Government. The way isthought to be opening for offensive action by the Allies on all fronts. Commentsobered down somewhat when the initial excitement engendered by the news hadsubsided and the real proportions of the task ahead of the Allies became apparent.The unification of the Allied command under General Eisenhower is&apos; regarded with general satisfaction. Some sections of the South African press point outthat the reopening of the Mediterranean, and the consequent decline in import -ance of the Cape route, will mean that South Africa&apos;s own role in the war will; infuture, be of considerably less importance, as she will no longer form part of themain life-line of many Allied fronts. There was some caustic comment on the reported account of General Montgomery&apos;s reception of General von Thoma.The rout of Rommel&apos;s army made a deep impression on the Opposition, which hastaken a fair and objective review of recent events.51. Opinion is divided over Darlan, the prevailing view seeming to be thatthe Allies cannot afford to pick and choose in accepting aid from any quarter.President Roosevelt&apos;s statement that agreement was but temporary w7as evidentlywelcome. All the same, dislike and distrust of the Admiral are too deeply-rootedfor pro-Allied opinion in South Africa to be entirely easy, and there has beensympathy for the position of the Fighting French, and for the difficulties of theFrench nation as a whole.52. Mr. Churchill&apos;s speech on the North African operations was reported at length in both the Government and the Opposition press; Government opinionwelcomed it as fitting that the Prime Minister, who had so often had disaster and difficulties as his topics, should now have the satisfaction of recording success.His references to the Empire were thought to be primarily for the benefit ofcertain sections of American opinion, but pro-Government papers did not fail topoint out their relevance for the Nationalist Party in South Africa.
53. The sudden death of General Hertzog upset plans which were on -footfor a combination, under his leadership, of the Ossewa Brandwag, the Pirowgroup, and the Afrikaner Party. It was also disconcerting for Dr. MalaivsNationalist supporters, who, up to the day before General Hertzog&apos;s death, hadbeen attacking him bitterly as the chief cause of Afrikaner disunity. The decline of the now notorious Ossewa Brandwag is being hastened by the events in north africa, and the Nationalists also have changed their previous tune and are nowopenly admitting the probability of an Allied victory. To strengthen theireventual bargaining position, they are making efforts towards a rapprochementwith the Labour Party, with a view to a post-war revival of the Nationalist-Labour Coalition of 1924. The Trades Unions show a growing tendency toaffiliate themselves with the Labour Party, who are at present out to exploit thedissatisfaction of the public with the voluntary system for the relief of soldiers7dependants.   Speculation about election possibilities continues.54. The Minister without Portfolio, in a public speech, strongly repudiatedallegations of bad behaviour on the part of United Kingdom troops in the Union.55. A statement by the Commander-in-Chief. Simonstown, explaining-Admiralty policy in regard to German U-bpat claims in South African waters,has been strongly criticised on the ground that it is not for the Admiralty to dictate policy to the Union on an important matter of this kind.56. &quot; America prods its leaders &quot; sums up the South African view of theresults of the United States elections. The swing in favour of the Republicansis taken to mean that there is to be no slackening in the determination to pursue the war to a finish.57. It seems clear that many South Africans viewed with pride the reportsof Field-Marshal Smuts&apos;s reception in this country, and his prestige has accordingly risen still higher.Naval, Military and Air Activities.58. In accordance with the recent announcement by Field-Marshal Smutsto South African troops in the Middle East, the Government of the Union ofSouth Africa has decided to withdraw forthwith the 1st South African divisionfor leave in the Union, where it will be reformed as an armoured division beforereturning to General Alexander^ command.NEWFOUNDLAND.59. The United States Government have applied to the new found land government, through the Consul-General at St. Johns, for the lease of certain additional areas (amounting to 11,000 acres) adjoining the United States bases in Newfoundland.60. The grounds for the application were stated to be the necessity forsufficient and suitable areas to ensure to the United States Government controlover such matters as water supply and the establishment of civilian communitiesnear the barracks, provision for training, target ranges and gun installations, andthe policing of posts in the immediate vicinity of the TJnited States bases. the newfoundland Government, while fearing that there may be some public criticism of their action, have decided to accede to this request except in respect of one area at St. Johns, where it was felt that the military necessity for its inclusion in the areas leased to the United States was not great enough to warrant incurringthe strong public disapproval which its alienation would be likely to provoke.EIRE.61. Speaking at Longford on the 8th November, Mr. de Valera dealt at length with the international position of Eire. He said: &quot;We wish ill tonobody, we want nothing from anybody but that for which we have fought inthe past, our freedom.&quot; As long as the war went on the danger to the country-would increase, and the things that counted most in preserving their freedom andtheir past were the determination of every man to give his life for them and themaintenance of the unity which they had at present. Mr. de Valera appealed to the young men of 18 and 20 to join the Regular Army and to every person inthe country to be as determined individually as the nation was as a whole tomaintain their freedom no matter against whom.   &quot; I sometimes think that we
hardly realise how we have been favoured by Providence in this country, when you think of the millions that have died on the Continent of Europe and themultitudes driven from their homes.&quot; So long as the war continued there wouldbe danger, and the more critical the phases of the war became the greater thedanger.   There should be no reason for complacency.62. Speaking on the same day, Mr. Lemass said that the Government wouldacquiesce in the postponement of a general election only if it was evident thatsuch a course had general agreement, &quot; The maintenance of neutrality,&quot; he said,&quot; the protection of vital national interests during the war, perhaps the verypreservation of our nationhood, depends on the unanimity of purpose and the mutual trust and confidence between Government and people.&quot;63. Besides Mr. Lemass&apos;s speech, there have been many utterances during-the last month by Eire politicians regarding the forthcoming General Election.Speaking again on the 30th November, Mr. Lemass said : &quot;It seems now certainthat a General Election will be held, which Messrs. Mulcahy and 0&apos;Higgins.are determined to force whatever the attitude of the Fine Gael Party as a wrhole.&quot;64. General Mulcahy, presiding at a Fine Gael Convention, \said thatFine Gael stood for neutrality and that it had laid the foundation of that policy.They stood for the maintenance of membership of the British Commonwealth ofNations and for international co-operation in the post-war world &quot;in all attempts to improve the conditions of the people. The future was what mattered, and aGovernment was wanted that would be a National Government and a parliament in which there could be full and free discussion.65. Mr. Norton, Leader .of the Labour Party, speaking on the29th November, said that a Labour Government would be the best guarantee that labour would follow the policy of neutrality.66. In a speech on the 29th November Mr. Aiken, the Minister of Finance,uttered a thinly veiled threat to the I.P.A. He said: &quot;Once decisions arearrived at, we cannot afford these days to have them disobeyed by a few. after all. in these critical situations we cannot afford violence of any kind against the institutions and Government which we have set up under our Constitution.Violence against the State from within even by a few must be resisted with thesame unity and determination as violence from without.&quot;67. Speaking in the Dail on the 19th November in reply to a request from two Members that the Government should give themselves local powers to issue,for the benefit of the people, money on the credit and security of the State,Mr. O&apos;Kelly, the Finance Minister, replied that Eire&apos;s currency arrangement with britain was entered into by their own choice and was an arrangement profitableto Eire. &quot; The countries,&quot; he said, &quot; in the pre-war sterling bloc had to acceptlimitations on their currency control. The amount of currency in circulationin Eire had been increased so as to provide for the needs of their country.&quot;68. Thirteen cases of typhus were reported on the 23rd November in county Galway, and persons arriving from Eire via Holyhead have, from the24th November, been liable to medical examination as a precaution against the disease being introduced into this country. In Eire 127 contacts have been dealtwith, and the authorities, who have closed the area, are hopeful of having checkedthe spread of the outbreak. It is understood that schools in an area of 175 square miles have been closed. The medical authorities in Eire are reported to have met with considerable local opposition in their campaign for disinfecting contacts.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political Situation.69. The most noticeable and welcome event in India during November wasthe consequence of events elsewhere the reaction to the news of the Alliedsuccesses in North Africa. Combined with the reports of the continued successof Russia&apos;s defenders a topic of prime interest in India the news acted as atonic on public opinion. The reaction from the previous feeling of depressionwas, indeed, so great as to cause for a time undue complacency. The politicalsituation ceased to hold the centre of the fHd and economic matters price increases, shortages of small coin and various commodities wrere the chiefconcern locally.
2Zi70. The internal situation remains quiet on the whole Instances^ of sabotage and other forms of lawlessness continue to be reported, from Bombayand Eastern India, but no fresh major outbreaks have occurred. A welcomeincident was the resumption, near the end of the month, ot work m theAhmedabad textile mills which had been idle for over three months.71 In the political sphere there is nothing of importance to report. Effortsby various public men-such as Dr. Mookerjee of the Hindu Mabasabha (whoduring the month resigned his appointment as Finance Minister in Bengal) andMr Rajagopalachari to promote a combination between the parties which wouldaive justification for the assertion of a &quot;national&quot; demand for the transfer of power have made no headway. Mr. Rajagopalachari. who had put forward ascheme of his own for the solution of the political deadlock, saw the Viceroy onthe 12th November and asked permission to see Mr. Ghandi in pursuance of his efforts at conciliation. The request was refused, since it was plain thatMr. Rajagopalachari represented no one but himself, and that his scheme had failed to elicit full support in any quarter. Thus the deadlock persists, andthere is no sign at present of that internal agreement on which alone any politicaladvance could safely be based.Indian States.72,   Some cases of arson and sabotage continue to occur, but generally thesituation is peaceful and there is nothing of importance to report.External and Internal Frontier Affairs.73. Afghanistan. There was little to report politically from Afghanistanduring the month. The eldest son of King Zahir Shah, a boy of about 9 yearsof age, died on the 26th November. The Vichy Governments Minister in Kabul,Chataigneau, who some time ago made it clear to Sir Francis Wylie that hewas in full sympathy with the Allied cause, openly declared himself as anadherent of General &quot;de Gaulle and informed the Vichy and Afghan Govern-ments accordingly. M. Chataigneau was Secretary-General to. the FrenchGovernment from&quot; 1937 to 1939, and his adherence to the Fighting French Move-ment should have considerable effect both in Kabul and in India.74. North-West Frontier. The Frontier has remained quiet. There havebeen important defections from the Faqir of Ipi, including his chief armourerand five other armourers. A representative Tori Khel jirga resolved to warn the Faqir that they desired to be at peace with the Government, and that theywould resist any attempt by him to make their country the base for operations against the Government.75. Tibet.- On the 13th November the Tibetan Kasihag sent a congratulate-latory message to His Majesty&apos;s Government on the victory in Egypt. Suitableacknowledgments were sent by the Government of India and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.The negotiations regarding the Trans-Tibet pack transport supply route for china made little progress, but the Chinese have now made it clear that theyobject to any form of tripartite agreements on this matter and desire tonegotiate direct commercial contracts between the Tibetan transport firms andthe Chinese authorities, which would subsequently be approved by the Chinese and Tibetan Governments. The Government of India were asked to instruct their representative at Lhasa to inform the Tibetan Government accordingly andat the same time to advise the Chinese representative in India that he or hisofficers should now enter into direct commercial negotiations with Tibetantransport firms at Kalimpong or Lhasa. It is not unlikely that the TibetanGovernment may stand out for a tripartite agreement of some kind as a sinequa non, if only to obtain a guarantee of payment by the Chinese Government,and the Chinese Government may find in that case that further progress isimpossible without the assistance of the Government of India,76. China. The Government of India reported on the 19th November thatthey had increasing evidence of Chinese political intrigues in India which involved a serious misuse of diplomatic privilege, the Chinese commissioner in India had been handing messages to the Indian press criticising, Governmenthandling of the Indian internal problem, while his Principal Secretary was known to have Congress connections and to be employing members of congress in his office. It had, moreover, come to light through a letter intercepted by the[24802] c
censors that instructions for political activities in India were being passed by departments of the Chinese Government through the Chinese Consul-Generalsbag in ! Calcutta.77. United States. The President has nominated Mr. Phillips, previouslyUnited States Ambassador in Tokyo and Rome, to fill the post of United StatesCommissioner in India with the personal rank of Ambassador. Mr. Phillips,who is now in this country, is expected to leave shortly for India by air. In a recent interview with the Secretary of State for India he expressly disclaimedany intention to attempt to mediate in the Indian situation, though he saidsubsequently that the President wished him to be as helpful as possible. It was explained to him that what was wanted was the presence of someone in Indiawdio could take a balanced view of the situation and could be relied upon to reportaccurately on the position to bis Government and act as a counter to thesensational and often misleading picture presented by the press.78. Persian Gulf. Our striking victory in Egypt had an excellent effecton public opinion in the Gulf, and the combined Allied successes in Africa, whichwere welcomed, encouraged the feeling that the tide has turned.Financed79.   Nothing to report.Economic.80. Wholesale Prices in India during the three months September to november 1942. The General Index figure of wholesale prices in India (base :August 1939 = 100), which had remained steady in the neighbourhood of 145between September 1941 and the end of April 1942. began to show: a further risingtendency in May. By the end of August it had attained to 161, and since then has risen to 178 at the end of the third week in November. Generally speaking, itcan be said that the second half of 1942 has witnessed the rise of prices in Indiato the high price-levels of the 192()&apos;s for the first time since the effects of the slumpbegan to be felt in India in 1930. This, however, dees not apply to certainindividual commodities, e.g., cotton and jute, which, although they have risensteeply in the last few months, are still below the pre-slump level.81. Outstanding features of the rise in prices since August are the increaseof 22 per cent, (from an index figure of 254 to 310) in cotton piece-goods,16 per cent, (from 175 to 203) in manufactures as a whole, 47 per cent, (from118 to 173) in raw jute, 15 per cent, (from 144 to 166) in raw cotton. On theother hand, the index&apos; figure for food and tobacco has gained only 13 points, or8 per cent., rising from 160 to 173, that of raw materials as a whole only6 points (from 162 to 168), or less than 4 per cent., while the figure for groundnutshas receded from 182 to 172. Although wheat prices have shown a small increase,from an index figure of 223 to 232, they appear to be stabilised at the latter levelthrough the control exercised fry the Central Government over this commodity.82. Food. Indian food problems hinge on supplies of grain, rice, wheat and millets in order of importance. The country is in normal times an importerof rice from Burma and an occasional exporter of wheat. The loss of Burmaleft India about 2 million tons short on her rice in 1942, though the home cropwas a fair one and the wheat also good. Early in this year a campaign forgrowing more foodstuffs was initiated. Transport difficulties, coupled with the merchants&apos; and peasant producers&apos; inevitable tendency to hold back supplies inview of external and internal troubles, produced local shortages in many places and made the provincial Governments reluctant to allow supplies to leave theirown   boundaries.    Hoarding   has  also  been ged   by  the   Congress.Meanwhile, the Central Government was called on to meet a heavy increase inthe supplies for the Army and to fill from Indians own reduced supplies theneeds of Ceylon and other colonies wdrose production of valuable export crops,such as rubber, tea and sugar, depends on imported food supplies normallydrawn from Burma and the Far East; some assistance has also had to be givento Persian Gulf countries, &amp;c. In facing these problems the Central Governmentin India found itself in considerable difficulty. Wheat and sugar controls were established, and later a control for other cereals, while all possible encouragementwas given, with sonic success, to the growing of more food in substitution forcotton, but the vastness of the problem- India&apos;s home cereal crop is 70 million tons and,the inevitable difficulty of dealing with the small-scale peasantproducer-consumer have made it necessary to resort to a new central organ and
a &quot;food Ministry has accordingly been set up at Delhi in the past few weeks underthe Commerce Member of the Viceroy&apos;s Council. Material results of this measurehave not yet made themselves apparent, but it appears that the first reaction hasbeen to bring to the notice of Government more clearly than before the dangers of the Indian food position and the possible insufficiency of her own resources,accentuated by destruction by a recent cyclone in Bengal and crop failures in theWest of India. The position is now under consideration by the Governor-general in Council and his conclusions are awaited.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.83. Royal Indian Navy. Gne minesweeper (lancaster/or) was commissioned inthe United Kingdom during the month and one sloop was launched.84. H.M.I.S. Bengal (minesweeper), of approximately 800 tons, in company with a Dutch tanker sank a i0,000-ton armed Japanese raider in the Pacific anddrove off another of 6,000-8.000 tons. Bengal was built in Australia and is a slightly modified type of the Bangor class being built in tins country. This typepossesses a high degree. of manoeuvrability, and the Commanding Officer usedthis to great advantage in evading action until he got close enough to match his12-pounder gun against the 5-7-inch guns of the raiders. It is believed that this action took place on Bengal-s maiden voyage from Australia to India.85. Some difficulty is being experienced in obtaining the number of officersrequired for the R.I.N.86. Military. The 4th Indian Division was engaged in the battle of el Alamein.87. The Japanese have made no attempt so far to advance North ofHaungdaw-Buthidaung, but some looting and burning of Moslem villagesNorth of Buthidaung has been carried out by irregular Arakanese forces.14th Division has carried out successful small patrol activities against theJapanese in this area. Reports of Japanese reinforcements and other prepara-tions in the Chin Hills indicate a possible move forward by them in this area.Bombing of Shingwiyang by the American Air Force has caused the Burmanrebels in this area to withdraw South.88. The malaria situation in Assam is improving, enabling preparations for active operations which were previously delayed to be continued actively. Thespirit of the troops remains good.89. Sabotage continues sporadically in Assam and the Bombay Presidency.It appears that further battalions will have to be allocated for the protection of railways.90. The operations against the Hurs in Sind continue, and it is probablethat troops will be required in that area for some months yet.91. 56,000 recruits were enrolled in September and 53,000 in October. Thefalling off from the August figure is to be attributed largely to seasonablereasons such as harvesting activities, an epidemic of malaria, the Ramzan andDussehra festiA-als, and to a limited extent to Congress propaganda. By reasonof the internal situation, it is probable that provincial Governments will requireto raise a large number of additional armed police. This may to some extentaffect recruiting for the army. \92. Relations between troops and the civil population remain good,although, as has been noted before, there is sometimes a certain amount ofapprehension when units first arrive in a district where troops have not previously been seen. Relations quickly improve, however frequently throughthe medium of games.93. 15,000 Chinese troops have now arrived by air from China and joinedthose which withdrew from Burma. They are being equipped and trained underAmerican direction.94. The supply of warlike stores to India has much improved in recent months, although of course there are still deficiencies in many items. Theshipping position seriously affects the rate at which these can be made good.95.   The necessity for building large numbers of aerodromes, communica-tions, bases, and advanced bases in Bengal, Assam and Madras Areas as well asto meet the requirements of accommodation for the expansion in men, ordnance[24802] c 2
stores and ammunition is throwing a very heavy strain on the transportationsystem ;;nd on the military engineering services.96. A if. The enemy has been inactive except for reconnaissance, but hecontinues to develop airfields, including one in the Andamans.97. Bombing by the R.A.F. and the American Air Force of Japaneseairfields within reach has been carried out both by day and night. It is difficultto assess the effect.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.t &quot;oriditioiis in Occupied Burma.98. Recently all political parties were dissolved and Dr. Ba Maw is nowhead of the one and only authorised Party. It appears that Japanese control is exercised solely through Ministers of the puppet Government and that DistrictOfficers consider themselves the servants of that Government and not of theJapanese Regime. The Budget is subject to the control of the Japanese, whoappear also to have taken complete control of railways, docks and customs.Education is conducted on Japanese lines. The conduct of Japanese soldiers isreported to be arrogant and it is estimated that of the Burmese population lessthan 10 per cent, is now pro-Japanese. Rather more than this percentage is saidto be definitely pro-British; the remainder is indifferent. It is thought that themajority of the population is convinced of an ultimate British victory and ofour reoccupation of Burma, and it is the considered opinion of the Governor of burma that the bulk of the population will offer no resistance to our return.Prices everywhere are high.Propaganda.99. (a) Ours. A series of illustrated propaganda leaflets has been dropped from the air. Recently United States aircraft dropped parcels bearing &quot; V &quot;signs and propaganda messages and containing presents of silk (rejected forparachutes). These parcels were described as a joint British and Americanpresent.100. (b) Enemy. The Japanese are playing up to the fear expressed byBurmans that reprisals will be taken on Burma when we return. There has beena recent intensive recruitment drive for the Burma Defence Army, which suggeststhat the old Burma. Independence Army has melted away and normal recruiting-methods have failed to supply deficiencies. Strenuous efforts are being made byradio and other means to increase cotton production.Frontier A dministration.101. A Civil Organisation has been built up to administer certain frontiertribal areas under the direction of the appropriate Military Commanders. Thereare now 33 officers for administrative duties along the frontier from the ChinHills in the South-west to Putao in the North-east, 6 civil police officers acting as intelligence officers, approximately 10 Public Works Department Officers,20 Medical Officers and 8 Supply Officers. As regards particular areas, in theHukawng Valley, Shinbwiyang, a village on the route to India, has been occupiedby the enemy, but has since been bombed and burnt out by our aircraft. All theevacuees in the Hukawng Valley have now been got out. In the Upper Chindwinthe Burmans are friendly and co-operative and a mild form of administration hasbeen set up in one valley. Salt is the main requirement of the civil population and arrangements are being made to send it in. In Northern Arakan a minorJapanese push has taken place and two townships, Buthidaung and Maungdaw,have been occupied by the enemy.General.102. A senior officer has been designated to examine, in collaboration withGeneral Headquarters, India, the problems of short-term reconstruction, such asthat of supplies required for the civil population in Burma immediately aftermilitary reoccupation.103. A separate Department for evacuees&apos; welfare.is being formed to keepin close touch on behalf of the Government of Burma with the working of theEvacuees&apos; Relief Scheme administered by the Government of India.
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note.; In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Programming of Import Requirements.104. In the September Report reference was made to the discussions then in progress on the above subject. Four telegrams have since been sent to theColonies; the two first explaining the purpose of, and urgent need for,programming, and asking the Colonial Administrations to make the necessary staff and organisation arrangements to meet these future demands for pro-grammes, and the two later telegrams asking for estimates of requirements for1943 and 1944 of 14 different articles.105. Early in the current month a new Section was set up in the EconomicDepartment of the Colonial Office to deal exclusively with programming. ThisSection, whose function it is to obtain and collate the estimates of import requirements of the Colonies, will work in the closest touch, in London, with theCommonwealth Supply Council (in particular the Non-Munitions Committee),and in Washington with the British Colonies Supply Mission. It will also bein close liaison with the various Supply Departments in London.Rubber.106. The rate of rubber production in Ceylon has given cause for uneasinessfor the past two months, and it is to be feared that the labour situation is such that a shortfall in the estimated production figure for 1942 is likely to occur.If adequate rice supplies do not arrive from India to provide sufficient for themaintenance of the present necessarily meagre rations, unrest amongst estatelabour must be expected. This will immediately have a reaction on rubberproduction.Sugar.107. Action to be taken regarding the production of sugar in the british west Indies and British Guiana in 1943 has been thoroughly reviewed in a seriesof discussions with British and American authorities in Washington duringSir George Gater&apos;s visit there, and with the Ministry of Food, Ministry of war transport and Treasury in London. The situation in all the Caribbean sugar-producing countries has to be taken as a whole, and the dominating factors arethe prospective large surplus of production over the amount which can be shippedto consuming countries and the necessity of - selecting the actual ports ofshipments with regard to the overriding necessities of shipping convenience.A telegram has been sent to the Colonies concerned giving the details of a programme of policy of which the principal features are :(a) Production of foodstuffs for local consumption must have absoluteprecedence over production of sugar for export wherever the twoobjects are in conflict.(b) Subject to that, the Colonies should produce next year all the sugarthey can.(c) While there is good reason to hope that the greater part of the production will be shipped, actual shipments must be governed entirely by considerations of shipping convenience, but in any event the whole ofthe production will be purchased by His Majesty&apos;s Government andin exceptional cases in which lack of shipping facilities and of adequate storage prevent the completion of the full crop, special schemes of assistance will be devised to enable the sugar cane to be cut and disposed of with the object of minimising the unemployment whichwould otherwise result.
Defence.Jurisdiction in respect of United States Forces.108. With reference to paragraph 93 of the August report an Order-in-Couneil was made at a meeting of the Privy Council on the 24th Novemberapplying to British Colonial Dependencies (other than the West Indian BasesColonies) the provisions of the United States of America (Visiting&apos; Forces)Act, 1942, which confers on United States Service Courts exclusive jurisdiction in criminal matters over members of the United States Forces.Civil Defence.109. The continued progress in civil defence arrangements generally is reflected in the further reports which have been received from several colonial governments. A.R.P. and Fire Officers from this country have now arrived insome of the Colonies and comprehensive schemes based on their knowledge and experience have been or are being drawn up. More are being sent out from here.In addition, some Colonies are sending local personnel to this country or Indiato undergo instruction in civil defence, Fire-fighting equipment is now availablein the Colonies and as a result it has been found possible to have local exercisesin civil defence some on a large scale in conjunction with the Services. , Theresults of these exercises have been carefully examined and obvious faults inschemes will be remedied. A further supply of fire-fighting equipment hasrecently become available and is being despatched to those Colonies to which itis allotted by the first available opportunity.A scension Island.110. With reference to paragraph 23 of the March report a detailed agree-ment has now been drawn up between the St. Helena Government representative in Ascension Island and the United States Commanding Officer regarding theterms and conditions under which the United States will operate their base and exercise defence responsibility for the duration of the war. The Agreement isbeing considered in London together with certain amendments proposed by theUnited States authorities in Washington and by the Governor of St. Helena.It is expected to come before the Combined Chiefs of Staff in Washington at anearly date.A den.ofelNov&apos; If2 Headquarters in the Middle East have recommended theto Aden&quot; reorganisation and expansion of the Aden Protectorate Levies with a view tothe formation of seven new companies (six rifle and one pioneer) for the defenceof airfields. The military authorities have undertaken to supply the necessaryBritish personnel (fifteen officers and fourteen N.C.Os.) as well as certainequipment. Confirmation is being obtained that the Governor has been consulted and agrees to these proposals, and it is being pointed out that, if the new units are to be a success it is essential that the officers and N.C.Os. should be very carefully selected and of the right type.Ceylon.112. A number of new military units have been recruited in recent months from local personnel. Additional Engineer and Transportation Units have been raised as part of the Ceylon Defence Force, and three independent GarrisonCompanies are now being raised as part of the same force. Three AuxiliaryPioneer Battalions have also been raised as Imperial units, but without theliability for service outside Ceylon. In accepting this arrangement regarding the pioneer Battalions it has been laid clown as future policy that all units raised in ceylon for local service only must be part of the Ceylon Defence Force, and thatno units will be accepted as an Imperial commitment without general liability for service overseas.Direction Island (Cocos).113. It has been decided that when the garrison, which at present consists of Ceylon Defence Force officers and men, is next relieved, it will be replaced by officers and men from India, since Ceylon cannot find further volunteers.
*British Solomon Islands Protectorate.114. With reference to paragraph 75 of the October Report, the BritishSolomon Islands (Temporary Provisions) Order-in-Council, 1942, was made onthe 24th November.115. A Military Labour Corps of Solomon (Malaita) Islanders is being Tel. No. 408formed by Air. Marchant, the British Resident Commissioner, under the authority forwCpac!of the United States General Vandergriff. 500 natives are being recruited as a first instalment. It is understood that they will be commanded by Australianofficers. The organisation of native guerilla bands is also being undertaken.Five United State marine officers and 12 N.C.Os. are being loaned for these bands,and available British Protectorate administrative and cadet officers are to be posted to them. The High Commissioner is flying to Guadalcanal to completeme organisation both of the Labour Corps and of the guerilla bands.West Indies.(a) Administration of Local Forces.116. Following the transfer of control of the local forces to the War Office,the D.Q.M.G., British Army Staff, Washington, has visited the Colonies con-cerned and reported on the administrative measures which are desirable toimprove the standard and training of the local forces. The report is under active consideration in the War Office.(b) Barbados....117. Further details have been received from the Governor of the enemytorpedo attack on shipping in Carlisle Bay in September. One of the twovessels in the anchorage was hit but did not sink. There were no casualties and the behaviour of the population during the attack Avas satisfactory. TheGovernor has urged the desirability of a permanent motor-launch patrol for theprotection of the anchorage, and this has been taken up Avith the Admiralty.Reports on Individual Colonies.Palestine.118. The British successes in the Western Desert and the Allied initiative in North Africa have made a deep impression, and aroused someAAdiat excessiveoptimism regarding the early end of the war.119. Arab enthusiasm oa^er Allied successes received a setback, eAren amongelements normally well disposed toAvards the Government, from statements byMr. Wendell Willkie and others on the anniversary of the Balfour Declaration,and the special prominence given to that occasion by the jewish communitythis year. These have aroused a fear that, so far as Palestine is concerned, an allied victory may benefit the JeAvs to the detriment of the Arabs. The result has been the revival of Arab political activity which has been markedly absentfor a long time. Particular notice has been taken of a message, reported tohaA-e been sent by Mr. Willkie to a mass meeting in NeAv York, opening Aviththe Avords &quot; The doors of Palestine must be opened to Jewish peoples of central and Eastern Europe after the Avar.&quot; This and other statements have evokedadArerse comment in the Arab press and numerous protests have been receivedfrom Arab bodies and individuals, including His Highness the Amir Abdullah.120. jewish politics remain confused. A major development has beenacceptance by the Inner Zionist Council of the Jewish Agency and theRevisionists of the maximalist &quot; Biltmore Resolutions,&quot; which Avere formulatedat the American Zionist Conference in New York in May 1942. The gist of themore important resolutions is as follows :  (a) Resolution 6 calls for an opportunity for Jews to build a JewishCommonwealth in Palestine and affirms &quot; unalterable rejection of theWhite Paper.&quot;(b) Resolution 7 calls for a Jewish military force, fighting under its oavuflag and under the High Command of the United Nations.(c) Resolution 8 urges that Jewish Agency be vested with control of immigra-tion into Palestine, and with the necessary authority for upbuilding thecountry and &quot; that Palestine be established as a jewish Common-wealth integrated in the structure of neAv democratic Avorld.&quot;
121. The Jewish Agency&apos;s relations with the Histadruth* remain obscure,and the attitude adopted by the latter has been responsible for two serious labour disputes affecting factories working for the Army. The introduction of the pointssystem for essential food-stuffs on the 1st November now seems to be accepted and recognised as not being as bad as the public expected it to be.122. There has been a further slight decline in Arab recruiting, and jewish enlistment also shows signs of dropping off again.J amaica.123. There has been some trouble recently between the Jamaica Governmentand the Jamaica Railway Employees&apos; Union. This Union, whose members consistof Government Railway workers, appointed as officers of the Union certain persons who were not Government Railway employees. These included personssuspected of subversive activities, and in the interests of public security theGovernor issued Defence Regulations excluding all non-employees from member-ship or office in a Departmental Trade Union, except with the Governorsauthority. After the issue of these regulations, however, evidence was secured ofthe subversive activities which had been suspected, and four persons, of whomtwo were officers of the Union, were detained under Regulation 18 (1) of theJamaica Defence Regulations, which is the local equivalent of Regulation 18bof the United Kingdom Defence Regulations. The Governor then cancelled thespecial defence regulations relating to Departmental Trade Unions.British Honduras.124. British Honduras was on the 8th November struck by a severehurricane. Belize, the capital, escaped with slight damage, but the NorthernDistrict and outlying islands received its full force. The loss of life is small,amounting, so far as is at present known, to only some twenty-five persons. the damage to private property, plantation crops, &amp;c, is, however, roughly estimatedat  1 million.Ceylon.125. The Government of India have agreed to the Ceylon government proposal that Sir Baron Jayatilake should be appointed as special representativeof the Government of Ceylon at New Delhi.West A frica.126. The Resident Minister has been concerned with our relations with french West Africa. He has had to handle several problems with the americans, including difficulties over the use of aerodromes in Liberia and anattempt by the Socony Vacuum Oil Company to secure long leases for sites whichit requires in connection with the provision of war-time facilities for theAmerican forces. Lord Swinton has urged the necessity for the appointment ofa high American personality as political representative in West Africa. the resident Minister has represented the very urgent need for railway equipment in British West Africa. He has worked out a scheme for a considerable reduc-tion in the gold mining industry. As a further step towards the elimination of racial discrimination in West Africa, arrangements have been made for theappointment of Africans as chaplains to the forces, with commissioned rank.General Federation of Jewish Labour in Palestine.
