(this document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;government).secret AW.P. (R) (42) i14th January, 1942.war CABINET.Economic Warfarei attach, for the information of my colleagues, a brief report for the month of December, 1941.II. d.14th January 1942.

MONTHLY BBPORT FOR DECEMBER, -1941.general,        The spectacular events of the month have not so far greatly affected the work, of M.E.W.     This is because: .. ,      .(a) Prior to the outbreak of war in the Far East, Japanese trade withthe U.S.A. and the British Empire had already been stopped forseveral months by the Freezing Orders.(b) At no time has the navicert system or effective contraband control been applied in the Pacific,(c) The U,S.A, had already, before December 7th, adopted manymeasures of economic warfare against the Axis.(d) The South American States have so far moved only a very littleway from their previous neutral attitude,2. The growing shortage of shipping and supplies, however, inevitablyinfluences our policy to European neutrals.     We need their productsmore than before, while they often find great difficulty, even when we grantnavicerts, in buying goods and obtaining export licences and shipping.     the trend, therefore, is away from the negative policy of import control alone and towards giving the neutrals supplies which can be spared, in return for adequate concessions.3. The weekly average for navicert applications rose to 1,800 inDecember, the highest for 1941.     Applications for mailcerts alsoreached a record level.  . Applications for certificates of origin on theother hand fell sharply because Japanese territory is, of course, no longeran acceptable destination,FAR EAST.A, On the outbreak of war with-Japan, the measures of economic warfarepreviously enforced against Germany and Italy and other enemy territories were at once applied to Japan and Japanese controlled areas.U.S.A. AND LATIN AMERICA.5. The U,S, Government arc pressing the Latin American Governments totake immediate steps against Axis economic activities.     they recommend;(a)-  the stopping of all economic transactions with, or for.thebenefit of, Axis countries or Axis controlled firms,  ..(b) the supervision of all business transactions of Axis nationals in Latin America, and(c) the arrest of Axis nationals engaged in activities dangerous &apos;to the defence .of the Western Hemisphere,They also hope that the Rio. Conference will agree to establish a&apos;uniform &apos;system of export licensing.     Failing this, they intend to press on with thepolicy of commodity control through purchasing agreements.6, There is some danger .that.the U.S. Government, may trust too much tothese agreements and too little to the physical control of&quot;the movements of ships by the exercise of belligerent rights and the denial of shipping facilities.   H,M, Embassy at Washington have there-fore been asked to discuss the whole question with the U.S.authorities before the Rio Conference,7o/
7*     The economic measures so far adopted by the Latin American countries are disappointing.    They are mostly of a financial character, and leavemany loopholes for enemy transactions.   The most effective action has, ofcourse, been taken by those States in or near Central America   who are actually at war with the Axis,8,     It seems that legislation, the Italian air line between Brazil and North Africa,has at last been forced by the combined action of the Ue S, and BrazilianGovernments to give up its services,.FRANCE AND THE FRFNCH COLONIES.9,     It has been agreed with the U, S, Government that   supplies front U, s, A,- to French North Africa., which were cut off after the dismissal ofWeygand, shall be resumed on a restricted scales   The French have beeninformed that two ships may sail for Casablanca, provided that two other ships leave North Africa simultaneously for the U0 S.*A,    Our proposal fora direct barter deal between the TJ, Ss and. North Africa was not regarded by theU.S. authorities as practicable at the present time .SPAIN a10B   Alarmed by rumours, none of which have been substantiated, that Spainwas re-exporting oil to Germany, and that Spanish tankers were fuellingenemy supply ships, the U, S. authorities imposed an embargo on oil shipments to Spain,   Latex&quot;, however, they stated that they would reconsider their decision if they were given the fullest information on the Spanish oil position,   We have impressed on the Americans the political danger of acomplete breakdown in Spanish oil supplies and have granted navicerts for shipment from South America of the balance of the authorised 1941 programme.We have undertaken, however, not to grant any further navicerts until we have,agreed with the U.S, a programme of future shipments,,118-   Proposals have been put to Washington for the purchase, by ourselves andthe U.S.A, of a largei&quot; volume of Spanish products in return for themaintenance of essential imports into Spain,SWEDEN.12.    The Swedish Government and H,.M, Government have accepted therecommendations of the Anglo&quot;Swedish Joint Standing Commission, wherebySweden stops the export to Finland of goods on List &apos;A&apos; (exports prohibitedto enemy territory) of the Anglo-Swedish War Trade Agreement, and includesfurther commodities in List &apos;A!j in return, Sweden&apos;s import quotas- of certain commodities are revised in her favour,,TURKEY.13a   We hope to extend our pre-emption programme in Turkey to include further substantial quantities of tanning materials, olive oil, lambs&apos; skins,wool and gum tragacanth.   The total expenditure planned now amounts to over 5 million.During the month of December a contract was concluded for the purchaseof all available Turkish chrome up to 8th January, 1943,
