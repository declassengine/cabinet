Misleading headlinesgiving the impression of sweeping Russian victories still relieve the gloomoccasionally, but editorials have attempted to see the war in its true perspective.Agitation for a second front has declined from the peak reached during July.2. The first Soviet Minister to Canada is on his way; the Canadian Ministerto the Soviet has yet to be appointed.3. Comment on Mr. churchill&apos;s visit to Moscow was somewhat non-committal and interest in it quickly disappeared with the Dieppe raid, whichwas greeted with enthusiasm and, as was to be expected, for some timemonopolised the news. The prevailing note was one of great pride in the&quot; 90 per cent. Canadians &quot; who took part.4. Affairs in India returned to the news during August. Opinion againstCongress has been hardening since the rejection of the United kingdom governments proposals, and the disclosures which followed the raid on theCongress Working Committee&apos;s offices brought criticism and suspicion of theleaders, including Gandhi, to a new high level. The arrest of Gandhi andNehru was, almost without exception, approved.5. Interest in the progress of the war in the South-West Pacific has beenmild, and comment on the battle in the Solomons slight. Criticism of theUnited States has for the first time for many months being voiced in the press and American aid to Australia has been called a &quot; trickle.&quot;6. Bill 80, releasing the Government from its pledge not to impose con-scription for overseas service, was finally passed and reached the Statute Bookon the 1st August. Feeling between French and English-speaking Canadiansaroused by the issue has died down considerably, but various &quot; incidents &quot;demonstrate the latent friction.7. The Report of the House of Commons Committee-on the Defence ofCanada Regulations included in its recommendations the lifting of the ban onthe Communist Party. The Government has been criticised for so far ignoringthis Report, and the expected debate has not yet taken place.[24374] this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.

8. The shortage of labour having become apparent, the public and pressshow signs of being acutely dissatisfied with the organisation of Canada&apos;s man-power. New man-power regulations proposed by the Department of NationalSelective Service have been widely approved but it is still uncertain whether theco-operation of the Service authorities will be forthcoming. The present lack of system has called forth a widespread demand for a statement of the Govern-ment&apos;s policy in this matter.Naval, Military and Air Activities.9. The 4th and 6th Infantry Brigades, together with some 2nd CanadianDivisional troops and the Calgary (Tank) Regiment took part in the Diepperaid on the 19th August.10. All R.C.A.F. fighter and Army co-operation squadrons were engagedduring the Dieppe raid and R.C.A.F. bomber squadrons took part in all the major bombing operations during the month.11. R.C.A.F. fighter squadrons were credited with 13 enemy aircraft destroyed, eight probably destroyed and 28 damaged for the loss of 12 fighters and10 pilots.12. R.C.A.F. bomber squadrons lost seven aircraft with crews. One&quot; intruder &quot; squadron was credited with one enemy aircraft and five locomotivesdestroyed and lost three aircraft with their crews. No. 407 (Hudson) Squadronscored direct hits on at least three merchant vessels.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.General Position.13. Apart from domestic affairs, events in the South-West Pacific theatre of war formed the main topic of sustained interest in Australia during August.The disquiet at the fact that the Japanese should have been allowed to occupymany strategic points, and concern at the situation in Papua, led to a statementauthorised by the Allied Command in Australia and confirmed by the PrimeMinister that United States aid to Australia had so far done little more thancompensate for men and materials sent overseas. The public had been led tobelieve that American aid had already assumed gigantic proportions, and this statement came as a great shock and produced an outburst of accusations thatthe United States had let Australia down, and that the United Kingdom andthe United States had relapsed into thinking of the Pacific as a mere sideshowin the war. Dr. Evatt publicly deplored this attitude, and repeated his assurance that the arrangements made during his visits to the United Kingdom and theUnited States were being fully carried out. He described as &quot; utter folly &quot; any suggestion that the Pacific theatre is not regarded by the United Kingdom andthe United States as of crucial importance in the conduct of the war.14. The attack on the Solomon Islands, coming at the time of this announce-ment, produced some bewilderment in the minds of the public as to whether or notthe official statement regarding the extent of United States aid should be believed.Comment was at first cautious, then joyful at the apparent victory over theJapanese, but the magnitude of the task was, in general, not lost sight of, and thegeneral situation in New Guinea and the threat to Port Moresby have remained a source of concern. The campaign in the Solomons is now generally viewed asa testing of Japanese strength.15. The gravity of the situation in Russia was fully realised, and, whilethe extent of German losses has been emphasised, there was considerable specula-tion as to the ability of the Russians to carry on the struggle if Stalingrad andthe Caucasus should be lost.16. The raid on Dieppe received great publicity, the general view being that its significance lies more in future developments than in the immediateperformance.17. The action taken by the Government of India in arresting congress leaders was unanimously supported in the Press. It was emphasised that theresponsibility of the United Kingdom to the United Nations, whose interests are closely involved in the security of India, and to the mass of Indians who areindifferent to Congress, make it impossible for control of Indian politics and defence to be given up.
18. Considerable interest in the Press and amongst the general public wasaroused by Mr. Hughes&apos;s attack on the &quot; gross acts of political censorship &quot;&apos;which he asserted had been carried out under the direction of, or at least withthe knowledge of, the Prime Minister, and had resulted in the excision ofimportant passages from his speeches featuring in despatches sent overseas bycorrespondents in Australia. Mr. Curtin denied that the matter had been referred to him. and political tension reached a peak when Mr. Curtin. in a speech at Brisbane, openly attacked members of the Opposition for &quot; sniping &quot;and &quot;obstruction.&quot;   Mr. Curtin was generally censured for this outbrust.19. In an attempt to induce the public to cut down their spending, whichcontinues at a high level, the Prime Minister launched an &quot; Austerity Campaign &quot;with a broadcast appeal. The campaign has been generally supported, but many people doubt whether the necessary results will be achieved without compulsion.The timidity of the Governments approach to this question was criticised. Thebudget was similarly criticised for its weakness and for its failure to imposeadditional direct taxation on the lower incomes where spending power is now saidto lie. Mr. Curtin described the  100,000,000 loan to be raised before the end ofthe year as &quot;the greatest challenge to sacrifice ever made to the Australianpublic.&quot; It was widely felt that the expectation that the public wouldvoluntarily cut down its spending in order to subscribe the loan representedunjustified optimism.Naval, Military and Air Activities.20. H.M.A.S. Canberra was sunk at about 2 a.m. on the 9th August in the solomon Islands area. Out of a total complement of 816, 10 died of wounds,74 are missing believed killed, and 109 wounded.21. Two minesweepers were launched and three were commissioned during august.22. One small ship was sunk and two others, one small and the other of9.000 tons, were shelled by Japanese submarines in Australian waters during themonth.23. Japanese forces, estimated at 3,400. which landed in the Milne Bayarea of New Guinea on the 26th August, were engaged and driven off by australian troops; at least 700 were killed, others were re-embarked and some are still being mopped up in remote outlying districts. Australian land forcesin New Guinea now amount to the equivalent of two divisions with supportingarms, and are commanded by Lieutenant-General S. F. Rowell. Commanding1st Australian Corps.24. Portuguese Timor. Following an increase of Japanese pressuresouthwards from Dilli, which began on the 16th August, the small Australianforces withdrew eastwards. Since the 23rd the Japanese forces, estimated at from 1,500 to 2,000, have withdrawn towards Dilli and have been followed upby Australian patrols.25. The reorganisation of divisions in the Australian Army, for the purposeof producing a more balanced organisation and one within Australian man-powercapacity, is nearing completion.   This reorganisation involves :  (a) The reduction of the number of infantry battalions by seven, theiridentity being retained by linking with other battalions.(b) The consequential reduction of the number of infantry brigade head-quarters by three and divisional headquarters by one.(c) The elimination of machine-gun companies from all infantry battalions,personnel and equipment being used to form two additional machine-gun battalions. The conversion of a machine-gun regiment to a machine-gun battalion.(d) The inclusion of an anti-tank platoon equipped with four 2-pounderanti-tank guns in all the remaining infantry battalions, including theAustralian Imperial Force.(e) The elimination of defence and employment platoons at divisional,brigade and L. of C. area headquarters.[24374] B 2
26. About 4,000 reinforcements for the Australian Imperial Force havebeen sent to the Middle East,27. United States forces in Australia now total over 99,000, of which about68,000 are ground troops.28. The 9th Australian Division in Egypt occupied the right sector of the30th Corps forward of El Alamein; its activities were mainly confined topatrolling, but on the night of the 7th/8th the El Makh Khad ridge wasreoccupied by a small Australian force, and on the night 31st/1st 100 german prisoners were captured in the course of a diversionary attack by the enemy inconjunction with his armoured movement round our southern flank.29. During the month of August 85 Allied air attacks were made on various objectives in enemy-occupied territories in the Solomon Islands. NewEngland Group. Portuguese Timor, New Guinea, &amp;c,; naval and merchantshipping was also attacked, with satisfactory results.30. Six air attacks were made on both Port Moresby and Darwin and one on Horn Island. In all cases damage was negligible. Successful interception by allied aircraft in most cases prevented accurate aiming by the enemy and causedhim losses in aircraft,NEW ZEALAND.General Position.31. Taking their cue from criticism by Mr. Hughes and other Australiansof the attitude alleged to be taken by the Allies to the Pacific theatre of war, andmessages from the United States on the danger of scattering forces, the NewZealand public became restive at continued Japanese progress in the South-west pacific. News of the Allied attack on the Solomons was therefore welcomed,though, in the absence of guidance from the United States, a very cautious view was taken of the prospects of the campaign. It was later hailed as a decisiveinterim victory for the Allies, and it was emphasised that the future security ofNew Zealand depends to a considerable degree upon the outcome of the navalbattles in the Solomons.32. During any lull in activities in the Pacific area, the Russian war hasmonopolised the news. Comment has been mainly gloomy and apprehensive,though high hopes are still entertained of Russian resistance. Second Frontagitation diminished considerably and it is now widely considered that it is nota practicable method of helping Russia. Great importance was attached to the moscow talks, which were regarded as evidence of close co-operation with Russia.33. Both in the New Zealand and Australian press a feeling of somebewilderment was expressed at the changes in the Middle East Command.34. The Dieppe raid received great publicity in the press. Some uncertaintywas evident as to the significance to be attached to the raid; in general, it washeld to have been a limited success.35. Affairs in India were fully reported. Press leaders approved the actionof the Government of India, and condemnation of Congress has persisted.36. The man-power problem has been the most discussed subject amongdomestic affairs. The publication of the heavy Middle East casualty figures pro-vided a reminder of the extent of New Zealand&apos;s man-power commitmentsoverseas. The view was widely expressed that the proportion of men sent outsideNew Zealand was excessive : it was pointed out that no other Dominion hadintroduced conscription for overseas service, and that the United Kingdom andother Dominions had given priority to home defence. The Governmentsannouncement of its man-power policy was therefore welcomed as a necessaryclarification of the issue. It was announced that Parliament had endorsed theWar Cabinefs decisions to provide reinforcements for New. Zealand&apos;s forceswherever they may be employed and. if necessary, to supply New Zealand forces for any other theatre of war in which they may be required. The calling up ofmen up to 45 years of age will continue. These decisions have been accepted,but critical press comment points out that the policy will be a grave strain on thecountry&apos;s resources and that there is a limit to what New Zealand can do.37. The New Zealand Parliament was to have reassembled on the 16th Sep-tember, but was recalled on the 18th August by the Prime Minister. Dissatis-faction wras expressed at the decision to hold a war debate in secret.
&quot;Naval, Military and A ir A cticities.38. H.M.i\&quot;.Z.S. Achilles and Leander and Fighting French ships Chev-reuil and Oiseait des lies were engaged with &quot; Task &quot; forces. Fighting Frenchship Le Triomphant is refitting at Sydney and Cap des Palmes is to be refittedand rearmed in the United States.39. The 2nd New Zealand Division remained in 13th Corps, holding thesouthern sector of the El Alamein position, with United Kingdom mobile forces on its left filling the gap between the New Zealanders&apos; position and theIT Qattara Depression. There was little activity and operations consisted mainly of patrolling. On the 25th/26th a successful night raid was carried out againstthe El Mereir Depression and some prisoners were taken.40. A redistribution of personnel has been started in New Zealand in orderto ensure that the 1st, 4th and 5th Divisions will comprise only Category A men.The 3rd Division, returned from Fiji, is being reorganised with a veiw to possible future employment overseas.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.General Position.41. The campaign in Russia continued to occupy a prominent place inthe news, opinion being divided between supporters of the Government, whowere cautiously optimistic regarding Russian ability to continue resistance,and Opposition followers, who prophesy a gloomy outlook for the Allies onceStalingrad has fallen and Russia has been forced to make a separate peace.42. Comment on Mr. Churchill&apos;s visit to Moscow was non-committal, thepiess generally being somewhat puzzled as to its significance. General Smuts&apos;meeting with Mr. Churchill at Cairo was prominently featured.43. Fantastic rumours reporting an Allied invasion of Europe werecurrent on the morning of the raid on Dieppe. Though welcomed as a sign ofbetter things to come, general disappointment was felt that more was notaccomplished.44. News of the battle of the Solomon Islands was received with caution,though pro-Government papers expressed satisfaction that it was possible to start a campaign in the Far East.45. Opinion about the action of the Government of India in arrestingCongress leaders was divided as usual between Government and Oppositionsupporters. The former gave full approval, while, the latter continue to linktogether the fate of Afrikaners and Indians under British rule and to expresssympathy with Indians in their attempts to rid themselves of the &quot; interlopers.&quot;Meetings of Indians at Durban and Johannesburg have expressed support forCongress&apos;s &quot;quit India&quot; demand, and &quot;detestation&quot; of the &quot;British reignof terror &apos;&apos; in India.46. South African politics are at present dominated by discussion aboutthe General Election, due next year. The Government have not yet decidedwhen it shall take place, and General Smuts, at a meeting of United Partyorganisers at Johannesburg, declared that he could not hold an election withouta considerable improvement in the war situation. The Government are decliningin popularity and criticism is increasing of the Cabinet, which is held, evenby the Government press, to be aged and inefficient. It is also realised by many Government supporters that time may be on the side of the Opposition,and that, since an improvement in the war situation is unlikely in the nearfuture, the election should be held as soon as possible.47. Dr. Malan and his Nationalists continue their struggle with theOssewa Brandwag. The latter have made clear their intention of putting up&quot; Independent &quot; candidates at the General Election in order to split theOpposition vote, their object being to demonstrate the weakness of the nationalist party and the futility of a Parliamentary Opposition and organised party politics generally. Dr. van Rensburg, Commandant-General of ossewa brandwag, and German broadcasts have shattered Dr. Malan&apos;s expressed belief that a victorious Germany would have no interest in affairs in South Africa,and the Nationalist Party is now fearing that if the war should progressfavourably for the Axis, many of their members might transfer to the ossewa brandwag camp.
48. Mr. Hofmeyr, Minister of Finance, speaking on the 25th August,praised the Union&apos;s sound financial state while bearing a defence expenditureof  80,000,000 a year. As a result of successful borrowing, the Government hadbeen able not only to meet internal requirements, but to proceed with the policyof liquidating external debt.  32,000.000 of Union stock held in London being acquired last year with the assistance of the United Kingdom Government.There were criticisms of Mr. Hofmeyr in some quarters for his failure toconscript idle bank reserves and to take sufficient steps to avoid inflation inthe Union where pseudo-boom conditions are being enjoyed.Naval, Military and Air Activities.49. The. 1st South African Division spent the month in the left sector of 30th Corps, roughly in the centre of the El Alamein position with the9th Australian Division on its right and the 5th Indian Division on its left.The month was uneventful, since no major operation took place although activepatrolling was constantly carried out.50. According to a British field censorship summary, the morale of theSouth African forces in the Middle East has not suffered to any appreciable extent in spite of the fall of Tobruk and the capture there of most of the2nd South African Division. References to blunders and criticisms ofleadership were noted, but these by no means represent the general feeling,which  was to accept our reverses and concentrate on throwing the enemy back.Fear that subversive elements in the Union would take advantage. of SouthAfrican reverses was expressed by some correspondents.Economic.51. Mr. Sturrock, the Union Minister of Railways and Harbours, accom-panied by Colonel Hamilton, the Port Director at Cape Town, arrived in Englandby air from South Africa on the 20th August. He came to discuss shipping and supply questions, and is having talks with United Kingdom Ministers concerned.He was joined in London by Mr. John Martin, the head of the Union PurchasingMission in the United States. The Minister is returning to South Africa towardsthe end of September.NEWFOUNDLAND.52. As a result of the visit to Newfoundland of the Commanding Officer ofone of the regiments serving here, referred to in paragraph 48 of the Report for july, arrangements were made for the despatch to this country of 100 recruitsduring September and a further 100 at a slightly later date. It is also hopedduring the winter months to secure recruits for oversea service at the rate ofabout fifty a month. A scheme of registration for national service has been instituted.EIRE.53. The chief matter of interest in Eire circles during this month has beenthe case of six young men aged between 18 and 21 who were sentenced to deathat Belfast for the murder of a police constable on Easter Sunday. The constablewas one of a number detailed to prevent I.R.A. demonstrations, and the six menwere all members of an armed gang and self-confessed members of the I.R.A.They waylaid a police car and fired on it. The police gave chase and the gang-fled to a house where the constable went to arrest them. As a result a gun battlefollowed, during wdiich he was shot. dead. The subsequent appeal of the six menagainst the sentence was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in belfast and leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused.54. Much interest in the case has been shown both in Northern Irelandand in Eire, and appeals and petitions for the reprieve of the men have beenforwarded both to the Northern Ireland Government and to the United kingdom authorities. Mr. de Valera himself appealed to.the United Kingdom government through Sir John Maffey, but the United Kingdom Government refused to inter-vene. Finally, acting on the advice of Northern Ireland Ministers, the governor of Northern Ireland reprieved five of the men, commuting the sentences of four of them to imprisonment for life and that of the fifth to fifteen years. The sixthman, Thomas Williams, who stated that he had fired the shot which killed thepolice constable, was executed on the 2nd September.
55.   Crowds assembled in Dublin on the day of the execution and enforcedthe closing of shops, &amp;c, but there do not appear to have been serious disorders.The announcement, on that day, of the discovery of arms in Northern Irelandand of the shooting by the police in this connection of a man armed with a tommygun appears to have done something to reduce sympathy for the six men.56. Addressing a general parade of the local Defence Forces at Ennis onthe 15th August, Mr. de Valera said that the Irish people would be very foolishif they allowed themselves to slacken in the slightest in their defensive prepara-tions. &quot; Some people,&quot; he said. &quot; might think that because the principal theatre of war is distant at the moment, it will remain so. One can never be sure of that.The Irish people must be constantly on the watch. Nowadays the first intimationof war might be the booming of guns and the bursting of shells.&quot;57. Mr. William Bullitt, former United States Ambassador to France, hada meeting with Mr. de Valera in Limerick on the 16th August. The mattersdiscussed were not disclosed.58. The local elections took place at the end of August, There was apparently a good deal of apathy on the part of the electors which may, of course,be partly explained by the lack of transport facilities. The outstanding feature of the elections was the success of Labour candidates. For example, in Dublin,Labour&apos;s total poll was 36,000 against 4.000 for all other parties. Most ofLabour&apos;s successes were won at the expense of Fianna Fail (the Governmentparty).59. An Order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce providesthat morning and evening newspapers in Eire may now use only eight tons of newsprint every fortnight, or 8 per cent, of the average quantity used eachfortnight in the first eight months of 1939. Mr. Lemass, announcing a campaign for the collection of waste paper, said that all imports of newsprint had. ceased fora considerable time, and that many weekly newspapers and all daily papers wouldbe forced to cease publication in the near future unless their meagre stocks canbe replenished. It is, however, known that, in fact, Eire has induced sweden to ship a quantity of newsprint to Lisbon in Swedish ships. The intention is tolift this newsprint from Lisbon in Eire ships.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political Situation.60. The German advances in Southern Russia were viewed with increasing-anxiety, but with Japan&apos;s continued inaction the external dangers of the war were not felt acutely and public attention, so far as it was not worried by rising-prices and the growing dislocation of normal economic life, was fixed almostentirely on the internal situation following the action taken against the congress party.61. Early in the month all eyes were turned on the preparations for the meeting of the All-India Congress Committee in Bombay on the7th August, and all indications pointed to the probability that theCommittee would endorse the threat of civil disobedience. Two or three days before the meeting the Government of India, with the object of influencing opinion inside and outside the party, published documents whichhad come into their possession last May relating to the discussion by theCongress Working Committee of a resolution published on the 1st May.These papers revealed the essential defeatism of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s outlook and madea deep impression on English and American opinion. But they had little influence on the rank and file of the All-India Congress Committee which at its meetingon the 8th August passed by an overwhelming majority a resolution calling forthe immediate transfer of power to Indian hands under threat of a mass civildisobedience movement. It was intended that Mr. Gandhi should forward theCongress appeal to the Viceroy and ascertain his attitude before the threat ofa mass movement was put into operation.62. The Government of India had already decided that this challenge totheir authority could not be tolerated, and they and the Provincial Governmentsput into execution the plans they had already prepared to strike swiftly and
firmly at the leaders of the Congress organisation before they could complete their&quot; preparations for mass civil disobedience. Gandhi and the members of theCongress Working Committee were arrested early on the 9th August; the All-India and the various Provincial Congress Committees were declared unlawfulassociations, Congress offices seized and prominent Congress organisers takeninto custody. There is no doubt that this prompt action scotched the movementat the outset and mitigated the seriousness of the outbreak of lawlessness which followed.63. As it was, a sufficiently grave situation developed, in several parts ofthe country and has not yet been entirely cleared up. It is impossible to give more than a summary description in this report. The news of the arrests wrasfollowed by a period of noisy and hooligan demonstrations in Bombay, Poona.Ahmedabad. Delhi and a few- other places. These were followed by more sinisteroccurrences which were known to be, in part at least, in accordance with Congressplans interruption of telegraphs and extensive sabotage of railways (notably in Bihar and. Madras), attempted seduction of Government servants followed byattacks on police posts and other Government buildings, accompanied in somecases by savage murders of policemen and others, while in the most seriously affected districts, chiefly in Northern Bihar and the eastern part of the united provinces, the administration was for a time completely overpowered and wasonly slowly being restored with military help. Part of the Central Provinceswas also seriously affected. But over the greater part of the country there was little or no disturbance; the Moslems kept aloof; the response of the police and therest of the civil administration to the heavy calls upon them was very satisfactory;and public opinion was shocked by the violent outcome of the non-violent doctrinesof Congress. Apart from the serious obstacles caused by the interruptions oftelegraph and railway communications, the war effort was hampered by strikes in mills and factories, mostly short-lived, though the most serious of all, a strike in the Tata steel works not so much of the ordinary worker as of the foremenand others more amenable to political pressure still persisted at the end of themonth.64. By the end of August the situation generally had much improved butthere was some cause for anxiety that September wrould see a renewed attempt ata widespread, challenge to Government and interference with the administration.65. In contrast to the foregoing it may be noted with satisfaction that inAssam it was found possible to resume ministerial government which was inter-rupted by the resignation of the. Assam Ministry last December. provincial governments are now being conducted by Indian Premiers and Ministers in fiveProvinces out of eleven Assam. Bengal, Orissa, Punjab and Sind.Indian States.66. Following the arrest of the Congress leaders disturbances also occurred,in a number of Indian States but were by no means general. In four States,Mysore. Baroda, Kotah and Sangli, they were serious enough to necessitate firing.Except in Mysore railway communications were undisturbed. Sabotage issuspected to have been responsible for the destruction by fire of a silk factory in Kashmir.Foreign and Frontier Relations.67. Afghanistan. An unfortunate case of violation of Afghan territoryoccurred on the 30th July, when three R.A.F. planes, engaged in operations nearDatta Khel, overshot their target in cloudy conditions and bombed, two villageson the Afghan side of the frontier, causing some fatal casualties and destroyingseveral houses. A protest was at once lodged by the Afghan Minister for ForeignAffairs, and when on enquiry it was found that the Afghan protest was justified,His Majesty&apos;s Minister was instructed, to make an immediate and unqualifiedapology to the Afghan Government and an offer to pay compensation. Though,for purposes of publicity, the Afghan Government issued an announcement inwhich reference was made to &quot; demands &quot; which had been made to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment for disciplinary action to be taken against those responsible forthe bombing and for a guarantee against any recurrence demands towhich, as was explained to them. His Majesty&apos;s Government could not accede the Afghan Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs both took up areasonable attitude in discussing this case with Sir Francis Wylie, and it is hopedthat with the payment of compensation the incident will be satisfactorily closed.
68. At a very friendly interview, on the 7th August, Sir Francis Wylie,found the Prime Minister gravely concerned over the present situation. He hadobviously made up his mind that Russia was finished and saw the war comingtowards&apos;him at a terrific pace. At the same time he was apprehensive of develop-ments in India, as the result of the Congress campaign, in view of the dangerfrom Japan, and. suggested that America&quot; should be called in as arbitrator. he also asked why the Allies did not open a second front. As regards his own internal situation, the Prime Minister professed to be easy in his mind, and he expressed confidence that he had the Axis legations, wdio had no funds at their disposal, taped. Sir Francis Wylie endeavoured to reassure the Prime Ministerabout the Indian position and the war situation generally, but it is clear from thisinterview that the Afghan Government has been badly frightened by recent events, and this being &quot;their state of mind it wemid not be surprising if theyattempted to reinsure themselves by closer collaboration with the Axisrepresentatives in Kabul.69. In a written communication the Prime Minister asked Sir FrancisWylie to convey to His Majesty&apos;s Government an expression of his sincerecondolence on the death of His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent, His letter saidthat the tragedy had been a cause of genuine sorrow to the entire Royal Familyof Afghanistan. The King of Afghanistan telegraphed personally to HisMajesty.70. The North-West Frontier. In North Waziristan, the continuedisolation of the Datta Khel post in the Tochi Valley necessitated the despatchof a relief column supported by aircraft. Surprised at the strength of theGovernment forces, the hostiles dispersed, and the column, aided by the localtribes, reached its object with negligible opposition. Advantage was taken of thepresence of troops in the Tochi Valley&apos; to assist the frontier tribal leaders toreassert their authority and to obtain a satisfactory settlement with these tribes,some of whose members have assisted the hostiles. The roads to Datta Khel fromMiranshah and Gardi were opened and repaired. Tribal reactions to efforts to enlist their support for the civil disobedience campaign have been altogethersatisfactory. * . .71. Tibet.&apos; Negotiations with the Chinese and Tibetans on the trans-Tibet pack transport scheme have continued. The Chinese have apparentlyagreed to give up the jclea of placing supervisors along the route, but haveexpressed a desire to send transport experts to Lhasa, to take part in the negotia-tions. They also propose to raise with the Tibetans the question of using two other routes as well as the northern route to Jyrekundo already agreed upon. TheBritish representative in Lhasa has been instructed to inform &quot;the. Chinese andTibetans that he is now in a position to enter into discussions of the details ofthe necessary agreements for the scheme, which it is proposed should betrilateral. Difficulties may arise over the financing of the scheme, owing to theprobable tendency of the Tibetans to look to us for payment rather than to theChinese.72. Sinkiang. Air. Shipton, the outgoing-Consul-General at Kashgar, has met his successor, Mr. Gillett, at Urumchi, where they were to have discussions with the Tupan.73. China. In an interview with His Majesty5s Ambassador after the arrest of the Congress leaders in India, General Chiang Kai-shek said that he hadnot expected such rapid action by the Government of India, and explained at length his own attitude towards the Indian problem. He urged that a peaceful solution should still be sought, for if the question at issue with Congress couldbe settled, other aspects of the Indian question could be solved without much difficulty. He said that China could not assume a policy which would estrangeIndian feeling, and that, it was important that Indians should feel that one member, at least, of the Allied nations was in sympathy with them, or they wouldbe driven into the arms of Japan. He suggested that the only hope of a solutionwas through mediation by the United States, who should guarantee the carrying-out after the war of Sir Stafford Cripps&apos;s proposals for the grant of independence.74.   Simultaneously, the Generalissimo asked that personal messages from himself should be delivered to the Indian leaders under arrest.  The text of thesemessages was : &quot;lam deeply concerned over your arrest.   Please take good care[24374] &apos; c
of yourself for your country&apos;s sake.&quot; This request was refused by the Viceroy,who. in a personal reply to the Generalissimo, explained the impossibility in thecircumstances of agreeing to the communication of such messages to leaders underarrest for illegal activities.75. The officially inspired Chinese Press also took the line that &quot; appease-ment &quot; of Congress was essential, while in a public statement Dr. TsiangTing-fu, the head of the Political Affairs Department Executive Yuan, who hadbeen chosen to head a Chinese Education Mission on a visit to India at the invitation of the Viceroy, expressed the hope that even at this late hour some method would be found to improve the situation in India, and declared that ifthere was anything China could do they would be glad to do it.76. Against this background His Maiesty&apos;s Ambassador was instructed torepresent strongly to the Generalissimo that attempts by the Chinese Govern-ment to communicate directly with the Congress leaders of publish statements in China displaying sympathy with the Congress party must, in the existingcircumstances, seriously handicap the effort of the Government of India tomaintain law and order, and fill with misgiving the Indian statesmen on theViceroy&apos;s Council who had taken a courageous and patriotic stand against anattempt to weaken the war effort. His Majesty&apos;s Government also had to bearin mind the possible reactions of the Muslims to these approaches to congress and the risk&apos; of adding communal disorder to our difficulties. He was alsoinstructed to inform the Generalissimo that it would be convenient if Dr. Tsiang&apos;mission to India could be postponed for the time being in view of the fact thatdisorders in India had centred generally on the university cities.77. Subsequently, a reasoned reply to General Chiang Kai-shelCs viewswas telegraphed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador for use at his discretion. Thisemphasised how unfounded was the Congress claim to speak for India as a whole and how essential it was to the success of any solution that it should satisfy all communities and all classes. An agreement between the Government and congress would not solve the problem. Indeed, it might have the contrary effect and cause an outbreak of communal civil war. since what His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are in effect now asked to do is to &quot;throw over the other communities and letBritish troops be used as mercenaries of a Hindu Raj. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould not accept the suggestion for mediation by the United States. Moreover,there is no prospect that the Congress leaders would co-operate actively in thewar effort, even assuming that their political demands could be met.78. Nepal. On the 7th August the Maharaja called unannounced on HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, and said that on the eve of Civil Disobedience in India he came as a friend with a warning. While His Majesty&apos;s Government could count on him and his Government as a friend through thick and thin, steps must betaken to prevent Gurkhas from being contaminated by the same poison that hadinfected Indian politicians, whom he described as nothing but friends of the axis. He stated that he had heard from his officers in Eastern Assam that theIndian Army there was by no means sound, and that some of them had beengot at by the Japanese through Fifth Columnists.&apos; He had also heard thatGurkhas in Burma were being enrolled in the Japanese Army and all possible steps were being taken to undermine their loyalty. He suggested that all Gurkharefugees now in India should be collected in one camp &quot;at Motihari, where aneye could be kept on them.79. Colonel Betham was instructed to thank the Maharaja for his views and advice and to assure him of His Majesty&apos;^ Government&apos;s determination to tolerate no activity by any party in India designed to impede the war effort.As he was no doubt aware, the Government of India had at their disposaloverwhelming forces consisting both of troops, well equipped and reliable, andof police whose general loyalty and morale has been above reproach, and although there had been ugly incidents in India, at no time had the situation got outof control. As regards the morale of the Gurkha troops, the Maharaia&apos;opinion might possibly have been coloured by what he had heard shortly afterthe withdrawal from Burma, where the Gurkha troops had fought with theutmost courage and with excellent morale. Any disorganisation resulting fromthe difficult conditions of the withdrawal through the Assam Hills was beingrapidly put right by rest, good food and re-equipment,80. The Persian Gulf. Public opinion has been impressed by the speed of the German advance in the Caucasus.   The arrest of Congress leaders in
India was welcomed. In Muscat, the Political Agent approached the Sultanin regard to facilities desired in his territory for elements of the United states air Forces. The Sultan has agreed to grant the necessary facilities on certain conditions wdiich are generally reasonable, and are designed to place the UnitedStates Air Force on the same footing as the R.A.F. He has intimated, thoughwithout making it in any way a condition, that he would like to be supplied in return with certain quantities of rifles, machines guns and ammunition, andsome medical stores.Economic and Finance.81.   Nothing to report.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.82. Royal Indian Navy. One minesweeper (Bangor) commissioned in Julyhas sailed from the United Kingdom for Indian waters. Another has been commisioned and is undergoing her trials.One trawler (Basset) has been completed in India.83. Military. Normal ground patrols on and beyond the Burma frontierhave been continued. There has been no enemy ground activity west of the chindwin except at Kalemyo, while activity on the east bank has been confined to rebel Burmans. Two thousand Chinese troops of the 5th Army arrived atLedo early in August. Flood and landslides in Assam and sabotage in Biharare delaying movements of reinforcements, stores, &amp;c.84. The Datta Khel operations on the North-West Frontier mentioned lastmonth have been successfully completed, and the troops have withdrawn.Opposition was negligible.85. Units from field formations have had to be used on internal securitytasks in connection with the recent disturbances. In general the situation isin hand, but certain, districts of Bihar and the United Provinces are stilldisturbed.86. Air. Weather conditions have restricted operations. Offensivereconnaissances were carried out in the Kalewa-Kelemyo area. Supplies were dropped along evacuation routes in North Burma, The Bay of Bengal hasbeen patrolled to locate and attack enemy naval units reported as likely to enterit, and to prevent repetition of attacks on merchant snipping made by enemyflying-boats. In India internal security reconnaissances have been carried out and mails carried.87. General. The intake of recruits for the Army in July was approximately 75,000, which is a new record.There is an acute shortage of doctors and nurses. All efforts to obtainin India the numbers necessary have failed. Consequently present and futurecommitments must be met from the United Kingdom. A number of hospitalsare now inadequately staffed, as many have expanded as much as fourfold with no corresponding increase in personnel. There is an adequate supply of medicalstores and equipment.Recruiting for the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Corps (India) is satisfactory. by mid-July over 1,000 women had been enlisted in forty platoons locatedthroughout India. Personnel are mostly engaged on clerical duties. others are employed in the Observer Corps, in A.A. rooms and in signal units.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.88. The Burma forces which were evacuated to India are being reorganisedas two Brigades under a Major-General.89. From Japanese broadcasts it appears that they have continued theirpolicy of fostering the notion of &apos;&apos; Burma for the Burmese &apos;&apos; by appointing moreBurmese to posts of district officers, but that the salaries of Government officialshave been reduced to a half or a third of their former rates, and the Burmese arebeing told to work harder and to learn to regard Japan&apos;s war as their war if they wish to attain the goal of independence, which, however, they are being warned,cannot be expected in war time.[24374] d
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.90. Supplies to Colonies from the United States. The United states authorities have asked, in connection with their own plans for the concentration of United States industry, for estimates of future Colonial requirements overthe whole range of exports from the United States. The nature of colonial government organisation makes it impossible to supply documented estimatesat short notice except in the case of a few important requirements, but the natureof the provision which should be made to cover Colonial requirements is beingworked out by the Colonial Office with the Board of Trade and other interested departments.The officer in charge of the Colonial Supply Liaison in Washington,Mr. E. Melville, is now in the United Kingdom for consultation with the ColonialOffice on this and other matters affecting supplies for the Colonies from theUnited States.91. Reciprocal Aid in the Colonies to United States Forces. instructions have been issued to the Governors of all Colonial territories in which UnitedStates Forces are stationed, or are expected to be stationed, that they should follow the same principles as have been adopted in this country in furnishingsupplies and services to such Forces without charge to the United States Govern-ment. The cost of such supplies and services will, with certain unimportantexceptions, be reimbursed to the Colonial Governments concerned by the UnitedKingdom Treasury.92. Supplies of Oil to the Caribbean Colonies. The British Colonies inthe Caribbean area are having to suffer, in common with other areas in theWestern Hemisphere depending on tanker-borne oil supplies, including theEastern Seaboard of the United States, a reduction of 60 per cent, in their supplyof all oils imported by tankers, other than oils required for essential purposes.These essential purposes have been somewhat narrowly defined by the controllingauthorities in Washington. The Colony principally affected is Jamaica (other british Colonies normally import oil in drums and are less directly affected), andthe cut in supplies in Jamaica is expected to have serious effects on the main-tenance of certain local industries which have not been classified as essential,including the sugar industry. Serious apprehension is felt that the consequentunemployment may precipitate political trouble, but the Governor has been promised all assistance in dealing with the unemployment situation and giving any necessary financial relief. Advantage was taken of the presence in london of the British Ambassador to Washington to mention this matter to him, andLord Halifax undertook to see what steps he could take on his return to theUnited States.Defence.93. Jurisdiction in respect of United States Forces. Arrangements are in train to apply the provisions of the United States of America (Visiting Forces)Act, 1942, to the British Colonial Dependencies (except Base Colonies in theWest Indies) by an Order-in-Council which will make the adaptations and modifications of the Act necessary in these Dependencies.Tel. No. 539 94.   East Africa. Arrangements have been made to carry out an emergencyfrom E.A.G.C. training exercise involving the Navy, Army and Air Force and all the civil defence Services throughout Kenya, Zanzibar, and the portion of Tanganyikaeast of the Great North Road. The exercise wras planned for the last week inAugust and was to last for some days.95. Fiji and Tonga A agreements tvith the United States. Separate agree-ments for Fiji and Tonga determining the conditions under which the United$tates will exercise defence responsibility in those territories have now beenapproved by the Combined Chiefs, of Staff in Washington. The agreements are for the duration of the war and six months thereafter.
While these agreements were being negotiated a local agreement in respectof Tonga was entered into between the Tongan Government and the United StatesCommander in Tonga and was signed by the British Agent and Consul onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. This agreement,which still awaits the formal sanction of His Majesty&apos;s Government, will betreated as subordinate to the principal agreement concluded in Washington.96.   Fiji: Conscription of Labour. The Governor is taking powers by Tels- Nok 2S0Defence Regulation for the conscription of labour of all communities for essential    dc40oul1(Tmworks and services.   The measure is being limited for the present to males.   It x,,. 291tois the intention only to apply conscription in the case of labour required for H Cr-employment by the Government, but.the Governor is also taking powers to control the movement of labour from industry declared to be essential to the war effort.Provision is being made (a) for terms of service not less favourable than thoseapplicable to similar non-conscripted workers; (b) for dependants&apos; allowances incases of work involving separation or exceptional risk; (c) for cases of hardshipor undue disturbance of the economic life of the local community or other good reason.97. Western Pacific : Ocean Island. Enemy aerial reconnaissance over Tel. No. 318Ocean Island was reported in a telegram to the High Commissioner from the from H- Cr-Officer-in-Charge dated the 5th August. The Officer-in-Charge stated that theaircraft appeared to have been principally engaged in reconnoitring the reef.On the 5th August a plane circled over the island for one and a half hours firingindiscriminately from machine gun and cannon, but causing only one seriouscasualty and little material damage.98.   The island was attacked by ten enemy aircraft on the 22nd August. Tul- No- :\26Bombs were dropped in the Roman Catholic Mission compound, where one trom 11 Cr&quot;building was destroyed, and in the vicinity of the Residency, part of the remain-ing portion of which was demolished.   (The other portion was demolished in anenemy attack some months ago.)   There were minor casualties only and the natives behaved excellently.99. On the night 22nd/23rd August the island was shelled by a warship,probably a cruiser, but the results are not known. Early on the 26th August theOfficer-in-Charge reported that a ship was approaching the island. No further message has been received from the island; the High Commissioner for theWestern Pacific has suggested to the United States Commander-in-Chief, Pacific,that the present situation should be investigated by air reconnaissance.100. West Indies. (a) United States Troops in Barbados. A smalldetachment of United States forces has arrived in Barbados in connexion withthe proposal to extend United States aircraft patrol east of that Colony. Thisdetachment was sent after consultation with the Government. There is no UnitedStates base on the island.101. (b) Naval Defence Arrangements in Trinidad. At the request of theUnited States Naval authorities, part of the responsibilities of the British naval officer at Trinidad have been transferred to the United States Naval Officer inthat Colony. This is in accordance with the provisions of the United States BasesDefence Agreement (ABC. 3).102. (c) Air Operational Training Unit in the Bahamas. An Air Opera-tional Training Unit is being established in the Island of New Providence, wherethe capital of the Colony, Nassau, is situated. This Unit is being manned byR.A.F. personnel, the advance party of which has already reached the Colony.103. (d) Detentions in British Hondttras. In June 1942 nine Britishsubjects, one French subject, and seven German Jews were detained in british honduras under local Defence Regulation and prerogative powers on suspicion of having rendered active assistance to the enemy in the Caribbean, and particularly to enemy submarines. Two of the British detainees and the Frenchman were sub-sequently released by agreement between the British and United States Securityauthorities, who have throughout co-operated closely. p It was difficult to ensurethe safe custody of the remaining detainees under the improvised arrangementsnecessary in British Honduras and, after consultation with the United StatesGovernment, the seven enemy aliens, together with five of their dependants, were transferred on board a United States Army flying boat from British Hondurasto Panama on the 3rd August. At the request of His Majesty&apos;s Government theUnited States Government made available seaplanes from the Canal Zone Com-mand in which, on the 24th August, six of the British detainees were transferred
under British escort from British Honduras to Jamaica. The arrangements were kept secret and the transfer was effected&apos;without incident. One British detainee,who was prevented by illness from being transferred, remains in british honduras, as does also a Honduranean subject, subsequently detained, whom theUnited States Government have been asked to take over.104. Falkland Islands. The remainder of the British battalion has arrivedsafety.105. Civil Defence. Examination of further reports received from severalColonial Governments has shown that substantial progress is being made in civil defence arrangements generally. Experienced A.R.P. and fire officers have been,or will shortly be, appointed to the service of certain Colonial Governments attheir request and the supply of fire-fighting equipment which has recently become available has been allocated to those Colonies near operation areas.Reports on Individual Colonies.106. Palestine. The general atmosphere is calm. The progress of theGerman drive to the Caucasus is watched with some anxiety, but the Jewsappreciate its importance more than the majority of the Arabs. Among manyArabs there is considerable admiration for the Russian resistance.107. The attitude of Arabs in general remains satisfactory, and thereis practically no political activity. Interest in India is much less than mightbe expected, no doubt because the Moslem League has held aloof from the anti-Government activities of the Congress Party.108. Jewish political activity has been concentrated almost wholly on matters relating to the enlargement of the Jewish armed forces. There is,unfortunately, evidence that in their recruiting campaign the Jewish recruiting-organisations are indulging in methods of intimidation in order to obtain recruits.Jewish recruiting figures show a sharp decline from the high level of July;in particular, infantry enlistments do not reflect the interest of official bodies inthe Palestine Regiment, The first reaction of the Arabs was that the new-regiment wras entirely a concession to the Jews as the first step towards a JewushArmy. They chose to ignore the fact that with their larger population theycould, if they wished, furnish more recruits than the Jews.109. The employment, even by Orthodox Jews of &quot; strong arm &quot; methods,including tw7o minor bomb outrages, with a view to enforcing the observance ofthe Sabbath is prevalent, but public security in general is satisfactory.110. The position as regards cereals still gives grounds for anxiety, thougharrangements made with M.E.S.C. for wheat supplies have alleviated the short-term position pending settlement of long-term action which is under con-sideration. The buying scheme is working smoothly on the whole, though moreslowly than was expected. Slowmess is due mainly to labour shortage andripening of millet crop, which has to be harvested before work on other crops canproceed; and to uncertainty caused by war news and the existence of a black market.The situation in Trans-Jordan is normal.111. Kenya. Sir Henry Moore, Governor of Kenya, Chairman of the east african Governors&apos; Conference, and High Commissioner for Transport Kenya-Uganda Railways and Harbours, arrived in the United Kingdom on the16th of August for discussions with the Secretary of State, He is expected toremain in this country for about a month.112. Gilbert and. Ellice Islands Colony. On the 22nd August, OceanIsland, the capital, on wdiich remain about 2,400 natives and four Europeans, wrasshelled by a Japanese cruiser and bombed by nine aircraft, A certain amount of damage was done to buildings, &amp;c, but there were no serious casualties.113. Ceylon. The State Council have now approved the agreement reached between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Board of Ministers whereby the ceylon Government is to make a yearly Defence Contribution to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of Rs. 27 million until the armistice, and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis to assume financial responsibility for the Ceylon Defence Force.114.   West Africa. Lord  Swinton has been actively engaged in theorganisation of the war effort in West Africa,The Africa Committee of the Cabinet held its first meeting.
