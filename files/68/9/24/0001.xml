1 *icSPAIN..The co-ordination of our supply-purchase programme continues to be themost important factor.     Some progress has been made in arranging for shipments to spain of urgently needed raw materials, particularly rubber, cotton, sugar and hides.     A series of hitches occurred, however, in the arrangements forthe shipment of oil and, while difficulties hore appear to have been cleared up, they several timos reached critical proportions and have somewhat impairedthe favourable atmosphere created &quot;by the recent visit of an American rcprescnt-ative to Madrid.PORTUGAL.There has been little progress in the economic negotiations in Lisbonthough the wolfram discussions are proceeding in a rather more cordial atmosphere-uhere.     We may possibly get the production of the British mines and 50 % ofthe free wolfram after the Gentians have had the first &apos;l ,000 tons, but we are seeking to improve on these terms.     In any event, we, in conjunction with theUnited States, will clearly have to submit an attractive supply programme if-.ve are to achieve a satisfactory result from our general negotiations withdraw. Salazar.SWITZERLAND.Discussions with the Swiss Trade Delegation have continued but are farfrom reaching any final conclusion.FRENCH NORTH AFRICA. &apos;The two ships which were ready to sail from the United States have beenhold up since the appointment of Laval j   the service between the French V/estIndies and French North Africa has not, however, been suspended, and a contin-lation of the Portuguese/French Moroccan barter deal has been approved on a^visional basis.RELIEF.The Swedish Government have now received replies from both the GermanItalian Governments on the scheme for Swedish controlled relief in Greece,replies are, in general, favourable but the Swedish Government have been[d to obtain more satisfactory assurances as to the freedom of action of the&quot;rvisory Commission and the export of surplus foodstuffs %w Greece while therae is in operation.     The enemy wish to exclude the Aegean Islands fromscheme although suffering there has been very severe.   The Swedish Govern-have also been asked to tako up this point as well.
