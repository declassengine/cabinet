Cony No. ^V)V/AR    CABINET.SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION.FOURTH REPORT BY THE AIR MINISTRY.(Previous Report No. W.P.(R)(39)78).The accompanying report on supply and production shows the position with regard to the supply of all the more importantitems of equipment of the Royal Air Force at the 30th November,1939.In view of the fact that this report will be the lastone to be presented to the War Cabinet in 1939 I have thought itdesirable to give my colleagues a wider picture of the position than would be given by restricting the report to a record rfdevelopments in the last month only.The increases in the output of aircraft referred to inthe first part of the Paper and in Appendix 1 are, of course,reckoned on a numerical basis.      Even on this basis output has morethan doubled in the last year.      Numbers do not, however, as Ihave frequently pointed out,  represent in themselves an entirelyadequate guide,  and it will be realised that if such, factors asman hours of construction are taken into account, trieproportionate increase effected in output has been even greater.In particular the steady increase in recent months in theoutput of Hurricane and Spitfire fighters (which is nowapproximately 50% higher than it was even at the end of July)and in the heavier types of bomber has been most encouraging.

I think that it may alBo interest tny colleagues toKnow that the number of persons now employed over the wholefield of aircraft production is already higher than at the peak of production during the war of 1914-18? and ten times what itwas as recently as 1935 and 1936.K.W.Air Ministry, S.W.1.19th December, 1959.

OX &quot;JMONTHLY REPORT (HO.   4) BY THE AIR ministry on SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION.Aircraft.1.      The output of aircraft during the month of November,1939, was 810 as compared with the planned output of 839.Included, in these figures are deliveries of 14 from U.S.A.   in comparison with planned deliveries of 63.      The output in thiscountry shows,  therefore,  a gain of 20 on planned output.2.      These figures are satisfactory especially when there is borne in mind the fact that diversion of manufacturing capacity to the production of aircraft spares, which was referred to in the last report (W.P.(R)  (39) 78, para.  1), con-tinued during November,  and that there has been a counter-balancing improvement in the spares situation which will be reflected in an improved degree of readiness of squadrons.An adequate supply of spare parts is essential to continueduse of aircraft in operations.      Manufacturers still appear,however,  to pay insufficient attention to producing sparesin adequate quantities by the dates required and tend to concentrate on production of complete aircraft.      The planning of the production of all firms is therefore being revised toallow of the delivery of spares concurrently with aircraft tothe extent of lb% of the aircraft.3.      Reference was made in the last report to thehandicap to production -which results from the need for working in artificial light in view of obscuration requirements forA.R.P.  purposes.      The Air Ministry are anxious that suchhandicaps should he reduced as far as practicable,  and a committeis to be set up to consider matters relating to the lighting,heating, ventilation,  etc.,  of aircraft factories in presentcircumstance s.

4.      During the month of November1 decisions were taken to order 3S932 aircraft in this country at a cost of approximately 62 million and,  in addition,  800 aircraft were ordered inthe U.S.A.  and 220 were ordered in Canada.      There are nowoutstanding total commitments of nearly  600 million in respectof orders for technical and warlike stores, commitments whichwill shortly be considerably augmented.5.      Expansion of the aircraft industry by provision of increased floor space, by recruiting new firms for aircraft production and by extending the policy of sub-contracPLngcontinues.      Instances of such expansion approved during november are as follows;-(i)    V/estland Aircraft Ltd.  are setting up a sub-contracting organisation in Scotland, which will include Scottish Aviation Ltd.  and the ScottishMotor Traction Company Ltd. for the manufactureof Lysander (Army Co-operation) aircraft.      Thecapital extensions required by this scheme includethe dismantling of the building used as the Palaceof Engineering in Bellahouston Park, Glasgow,  andits removal and re-erection on the aerodrome at prestwick where it will serve as an erection shopto which will flow the component parts of theaircraft from the sub-contractors embraced in thescheme.(ii)    The motor service station of Rolls-Royce Ltd.  atWormwood Scrubbs will be used for the production ofMagister (trainer) aircraft,(ili)    A new factory will be erected near Swindon for theassembly of Master (trainer) aircraft fromcomponents produced by sub-contractors,  the principalsub-contractor being the Austin Motor Company, whowill make use of their motor car works for thepurpose.

(iv) The Bristol Aeroplane Company, in addition toexpanding their works at Pllton will erect andmanage on behalf of the Air Ministry a new factory near Warwick for the production of Beau-fighter (Tighter) aircraft.(v) Further extensions to the works of A.V. Roe &amp;Company Ltd.  near Manchester, Short Brothers atRochester, Short &amp; Harland at Belfast and metropolitan-Vickers at Trafford Park were approved during the month.      All these firms willbe engaged on the production of new types *fbomber aircraft.6.       The total productive floor space for the construc-ttox cf aircraft available or in course of provision at the out-bre-ak of war amounted to approximately 15 million square feet.It i&amp; estimated that a total of at least 20 million square feet will be required to meet the requirements of the aircraft programme, towards which extensions amounting to approximately4 million square feet have already been authorised.      Furtherschemes of extension of floor area are in hand,7.       As an illustration of the magnitude of the increasein capacity for the manufacture of aircraft a chart isattached as Appendix I showing the actual monthly outputof aircraft since the beginning of 1938.^gines.8.       The following arrangements were made during themonth for increasing capacity for aero-engine output:-(i)     In the last report mention was made of the transferof certain plant ordered for the production of rolls-Royce engines in their new factory at/Glasgow ..

G-lasgbw to their motor oar works which they have placed at the disposal of the Government for theproduction of aero-engines.      This plant is nowbeing replaced at a cost of approximately  200,000.(11)    The Standard Motor Car Company, who have undertaken in their motor car works the manufacture of DeHavilland aero-engines, are being provided withcertain additional plant at a cost of  30,000.(iii)    Armstrong Siddeley Motors Ltd,  are being provided with additional plant costing  200,000 to increase their production of Cheetah engines and, inaddition, they are acqpuiring the works of WilliamSpiers Ltd.  of Leicester, who have already been engaged on manufacture of parts of the aero-engines,in order still further to increase productivecapacity,(iv)    The scheme frr the repair of Rolls-Royce and Bristoltypes of engine by the Rootes Securities organisation has been worked out in detail.      It has beendecided that the Sunbeam-Talbot works shall be equipped for the repair of Rolls-Royce engines ata cost of  390,000,  and the Humber works for the repair of Bristol engines at a cost of  300,000.In addition,  85,000 worth of machine tools will beprovided for the manufacture of spare parts of rolls-Royce engines,  to be used in the repair work.Each organisation will be equipped in the firstinstance to repair 60 engines a week, but provision is being made, by the ordering of such machines astake a long time to obtain, for the increase oftheir capacity to 100 engines a week.

9.      It is worthy of note that, by the third week ofNovember, the output of Rolls-Royce engines exceeded 100-per week,  the first time since the last war that an engine firmhas achieved this rate of output.Engine Accessories.10.      The production of De Havilland airscrews will be expanded by use of part of the Standard Motor Car Company&apos;sshops,  and it has been decided to provide machine tools for thispurpose at a cost of  13,000.Reference was made in the third report (W.P.(R)(39)78,paragraph 7) to the decision to establish a large additionalsource of supply of B.T.H. magnetos.    This expansion will beeffected by extending the existing works of the B.T.H.  company at Coventry and Rugby and by establishing a new factory atLeicester under the management of the Company.    The total costof this scheme will amount to some  1,500,000,  of which , 880,000are required for machine tools.Armament.11.        Guns and ammunition.    An increase in the output ofVickers &quot;K&quot; guns to meet the changed requirements as a resultof war experience has been authorised and production of this type of gun, which had previously been planned for an output of1,350 a month,  will be increased as soon as possible to an output of 2,000 a month.    The additional capacity required forthis purpose is being provided,  at a cost of approximately 500,000, by sub-contracting parts of the gun for assembly inthe Vickers works at Crayford and by doubling the capacity of anew factory,  construction of which has just started, at Openshaw,12.      Pending determination of exact requirements of 20 mm.cannon guns, which depend to a large extent on decisions as tothe armament of new types&apos; of aircraft not yet in production,arrangements are being made for the production of 1,500 cannon/guns  ...

*) Pi ..JO $.) :lguns a month.    Approval was given during November forextensions, costing approximately  800,000, to the capacity ofthe British Manufacture &amp; Research Company and the B.S.A.Company to achieve this rate of output,13.      A table showing the present estimated requirements of machine guns and Hispano Suiza cannon guns, together withdeliveries to date,  is attached as Appendix II.14.      As the Cabinet is aware there will be a serious shortage of .303&quot; ammunition for machine guns for some while,and arrangements for dealing with this d: fficulty are now thesubject of discussion between the Departments concerned.15.      With regard to 20 mm.&apos;ammunition for cannon guns, itis provisionally estimated that Air Ministry requirements will amount to 4 million,    rising to 6 million, rounds a month.Final figures will shortly be available; meanwhile theseestimated requirements have been communicated to the Ministry ofSupply as a basis for planning the additional productivecapacity required after making use of the capacity, amounting to400,000 rounds a month, which the Air Ministry have already provided.16.      Turrets.    A prominent feature of the defensive systemof modern aircraft, in particular of large bombers, is theenclosing of the aircraft&apos;s guns in revolving turrets which are normally operated by some form of hydraulic mechanism.    The needfor thus enclosing the guns derives from the desirability of protecting the air gunner and f:.om the fact that, at the highspeeds at which modern aircraft operate,  the guns themselvescould not be accurately used unless they were thus enclosed.The expansion of the aircraft programme has in turn necessitated/a ...

9 r*el,;;a large expansion of the capacity required for the productionof the various types of turret at present used in Royal Ala?Force aircraft.      Turrets are highly complicated pieces ofmechanism and,  as such,  require a large degree of precisionwork in their manufacture.      The securing of adequate potentialfor the increased programme has heen achieved hy extensive sub-contracting coupled with the association of large engineeringfirms with the firms which had hitherto been responsible forthe development and production of the types of turret which willin future be mainly required.      The arrangements which have heenmade for the production of turrets are as follows: -17.        Electro hydraulic Boulton Paul turrets, which havebeen developed by Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd., Wolverhampton,are being manufactured both by the parent firm at Wolverhamptonand by the Lucas Group with an extensive organisation of sub-contracting at Birmingham.      Additional plant, at a cost of 165,000 and  322,000 respectively,  is being provided by theAir Ministry to increase the capacity of these two firms.   t Inaddition,  the Lucas Group will erect and manage on behalf ofthe Air Ministry a new factory at Pontypool,  in South Wales, ata cost of approximately  500,000,18.        The Eraser Nash hydraulic turret was developed byParnall Aircraft Ltd. who are being provided by the Air Ministrywith additional plant to increase their production at Yate andTolworth.      With them have been associated Brockhouse EngineeringLtd. , who have heen provided v/ith plant costing approximately 300,000 for the production of two types of fraser Nash turretin their works at Southport.Balloon Barrage.19.        It has been decided to extend the balloon barragesystem to provide for the defence not only of London and other important towns in this country, but also of certain naval bases and possibly also of the Fleet,  and certain strategic/centres

9 ^centres on the Continent.    This increased use of the barragewill require an increase in the initial equipment of balloonsfrom 1,450 to some 2,000, together with all ancillary equipment and appropriate reserves.    In order to reach and maintain thisestablishment at the earliest possible moment production ofballoons planned in peace is being expanded fourfold,  and supplies of cables, winches, motor transport, hydrogen, etc.,are being expanded on the necessary scale.Raw Materials.20.       Aluminium and light alloys.    In the second report(W.P.(R)(39)43, paragraph 6) Air Ministry requirements of virginaluminium were stated to amount to 160,000 tons a year.    since then a more detailed examination of the requirements of theaircraft programme has yielded the following revised estimatesj-1940    -    100,000 tons1941    -    160,000 tons1942    -    186,000 tons.Monthly requirements at various stages of the production programme are shown in Appendix III.    These requirements havebeen communicated to the Ministry of Supply, which is responsiblefor supply of aluminium and has formulated plans for meetingthem.21.        Under voluntary arrangements accepted by the aluminiumalloy industry,  the allocation of orders for,  and distributionof,  fabricated light alloys for the requirements of the defence programmes are the responsibility of four Controllers working under the Director of Materials Production, Air Ministry,,(W.P.(R)(39)78,  paragraph 13).      The Air Ministry requirementsof light alloys, which have been fully discussed with theControllers,  are also set out in detail in Appendix III.22.        The position in regard to light alloy supplies to meetthe programme is briefly as follows/Sheet ...

Sheet and Strip.      It is proposed to supplement the capacity already in existence or in course of constructionby diverting certain plan&quot;!- on order for Australia to works in this country.     With these additions, the totalproductive capacity should be adequate to meet therequirements of the aircraft programme.     The Controllerreports that a small margin exists and there should beno difficulty in creating any small additional capacitythat might prove to be necessary to meet changes in theprogramme or other contingencies.-Stampings and ForgingSo      The Controller reports thathis review of the position is approaching a conclusion,and that the indications are lin-vt the capacity already inexistence together with the additional capacity plannedwill meet the requirements of the programme.      A certainamount of alteration in the destination of the plant on order may be necessary to ensure that the requirementsof engine forgings next year are met and this matter isunder consideration,Castings.      In the case of the light alloy castings industry,which consists of some 360 foundries of which only abouta dozen are of major importance,  it has been necessary tocreate a trade association before effective planning ofproduction and the distribution of orders could begin.It is anticipated that requirements //ill be met,  althoughadditional die casting capacity will be necessary for theproduction of the specially intricate castings used inaero-engines.      Plans for the - - ration of this additional capacity are under consideration by the CastingsController.Tubes and Extrusions,      Schemes recently approved by theAir Council Committee on Supply for the construction ofthree new tube factories at an approximate cost of  820,000are in train.    These are planned to give :an additional output/of

of 160 to 200 tons of tubes per months  the latter beingthe amount by which the existing tube capacity would belikely to fall short of the eventual requirements of theaircraft programme.      The provision of a margin by meansof utilising part of the new I,Go I.  factory near Swanseafor tube production is also under consideration.     Asregards extrusions, the possibility of substitutingsections drawn from strip for extruded sections is being examined,  and action is being taken with a view to acquiringcertain extrusion presses in course of manufacture forother countries.      The Controller is expected within the nextfortnight to formulate proposals for the acquisition andInstallation of 6 or 8 further small presses,  and these should complete the extension of extrusion capacity necessaryto meet requirements.The capacity of three firms engaged on themanufacture of rolling mills, extrusion presses; and otherplant used in the fabrication of light alloys is beingextended at Air Ministry expense by the provision ofadditional buildings and plant,23.    Timber.      Large quantities of spruce and plywoodare required, principally for the production of traineraircraft, but also for the construction of a new type of bomber,a large output of which is being planned,      estimated requirements of spruce described in the second report(W.P, (R)( 39)43, para.  7) have now been more accuratelycalculated as 6,250 standards in the first year &amp;f war andUjSOO standards in the second.      The Ministry of Supply havebeen asked to make the necessary arrangements to secure thesequantities.24.    Plywood requirements for the first year of war have&apos;0een estimated at 20 million square feet, for which some

en ft70 million square feet of veneers will be required.    It isanticipated that, with the help of purchases from the U.S.A,arranged by the Timber Controller under the Ministry of Supply,these requirements will be met and a small surplus should beavailable towards the heavier requirements of the second year of war which are at present being calculated.25.      Steel.      As a result of discussions which have takenplace between representatives of the Air Ministry and of theMinistry of Supply,  it has been arranged that, so far as concerns supply of steel for aeronautical purposes,  the Ministryof Supply will assume responsibility for the provision of the steel and for the development and creation of capacity for theproduction of steel forgings and stampings,  but that the AirMinistry will remain responsible for the development and creationof capacity required for the further processing of the steel.Requirements of steel for Royal Air Force purposes are asfollows.    Approximately 380,000 tons of raw steel and 240,000tons of semi-finished steel are required during the first year of war.    Requirements of semi-finished steel for airframes andaero-engines alone are estimated to increase to a peak figure ofapproximately 12,200 tons a monti- by October 1941.    A statementof these requirements has been communicated to the Ministry ofSupply.Labour.26.      The total labour force of the aircraft and aero-engineindustries (including sub-contractors) at the outbreak of waramounted to approximately 190,000 (excluding administrative andclerical staff);    since then some 15,000 operatives have been added,  an average nett increase of 4 per cent,  per month ascompared wit1&apos; a planned increase of 8 per cent,  per month.    Thesmaller percentage increase is in large measure due to thecaiiing-up of reservists to the Fighting Services.    It isestimated on a similar basis that a labour force of 880,000 willhe required in the 3rd year to enable the aircraft programing/approved

*)      *yIS.approved by the Cabinet to he fulfilled.     In other words, bythat date an additional labour force equal to three times thelabour force existing at the outbreak of war must be trained for aircraft work.     Moreover, these figures relate to constructionof airframes and aero-engines only,     A very large body of labour is required to provide the armament and necessary equipment forthe aircraft constructed, and it is estimated that the total labour required for the programme as a whole will reach a peakfigure of  &quot;1,400,000 (including administrative and clerical staff).27.     It is clear that, if the programme is to be achieved,such measures as considerable dilution of labour and the employ-ment of women on a much larger scale than at present  (some  per cent, of the labour force) will be required to be introducedfairly soon.      In this connection the Air Ministry, which has for a considerable time been taking work to available labourso far as practicable by a system of sub-contracting,  intends to extend still further this procedure and to ensure that,wherever suitable capacity and labour exists throughout thecountry, use is made of it to the greatest practicable extentfor the furtherance of the aircraft programme.     The outbreakof war stopped or curtailed the normal activities of a verylarge number of firms, mostly of the smaller type, andparticulars of the plant, labour and accommodation of a largenumber of such firms have been obtained, and every endeavourwill be made to utilise those that are suitable.     In order toensure that no suitable capacity is being overlooked, some 7,000firms, the addresses of which were obtained from Inspectors of factories throughout the United Kingdom, have been circularisedfor full particulars of their plant, etc., and this information has been scheduled on an area basis in a form which willreadily disclose to the industry where they can look for theiradditional requirements.28.     A chart showing actual and estimated recruitment oflabour:for- aircraft production is- attached&apos;as Appendix-.-2W:./Supply

9 *? nO io 0Supply Organisation.29.     Aircraft production had, prior to the outbreak ofwar, been developed in this country over a period of years ona scale which represented an outstanding achievement in thehistory of industrial enterprise.      The work of developing air-craft production in war has thus boon able to proceed on thesure foundations already laid.      This development of the supplyorganisation has meant a widespread review of supply in all itsramifications - from the airframe with its engine, armament,equipment,  spare parts,  right down to the items of raw materials,ground equipment and operational supplies required in theService.      It has entailed daily sittings of the Air CouncilCommittee on Supply since the outbreak of war and comprehensiveplans have been formulated and put in train to ensure that thevast supply organisation already in existence shall stillfurther widen and expand as the prosecution of the war maydemand.      Despite inevitable difficulties due to calling up of reservists, black-out conditions,  etc., the transition frompeace to war has heen smoothly carried out so far as thesupply organisation is concerned because the years of work inpeace have provided air adequate basis for the development ofour war effort.      The utilisation of manufacturing capacityfreed from civil work (as already stated), the creation ofsupplementary factories,  the training of labour now freed for&apos;v/ar work, the provision of plant and stocks of materials,together with the covering of a host of ancillary needs,have all been carefully analysed and subjected to the closestscrutiny in conjunction with other Departments and the firms concerned.      The results of this preparatory work are takingshape in concrete form and will ensure the progressive development of our aircraft production which will be necessary if our maximum national effort in the air is to he sustained./The

50.      The work of the Air Council Committee on Supply hasentailed a comprehensive review of the capacity of the industryto meet the expansion programme.      The rate of expansion hasbeen so great that it has &quot;been found necessary to createadditional capacity in practically all branches of aeronauticaland allied supplies, and since the beginning of the expansion programme capital commitments to a total of some  51 million(including about  663,000 in respect of plant for sub-contractors) have been accepted by the Air Ministry with a viewto provision of additional factory space and. plant for themanufacture of airframes, aero-engines, armament and equipment,and the provision of essential raw materials;    in addition,Contingent liabilities within a maximum of  7-g- million havebeen incurred under the &quot;Capital Clause&quot; and upwards of  51million have been spent on the provision and equipment of&quot;shadow&quot; factories for the production of airframes,  engines and engine accessories, bombs,  instruments,  etc.     A detailed statement of these capital commitments is attached as Appendix Pi.Surnmary.31.       Aircraft.(a) The aircraft output during the month of November,1939, was 810 as compared with the planned output of 839.Included in these figures are deliveries of 14 aircraft fromthe U.S.A.  against planned deliveries of 63.      (Paragraph l)0(b) The planning of the production of all firms is beingrevised to allow of the delivery of spares concurrently with aircraft to the extent of 15Jo of the aircraft. (Paragraph 2).(c) Action is being taken to improve the lighting, heating,ventilation,  etc., of aircraft factories with a view toovercoming the handicap to production of working in artificial1i ght *      (Paragraph 3)./(d)

(d)    Decisions were taken during November to order 3*932aircraft, at an estimated cost of  62 million, and in addition800 aircraft were ordered from the U.S.A. and 220 from Canada.(Paragraph br).(e).   Further measures have been taken to increaseproductive capacity.      (Paragraph 5,)(f) Of the 20 million square feet of productive floor space which are estimated to be required for the aircraft programme, approximately 13 million square feet was available or in the course of provision at the outbreak of war, and anadditional four million square feet has already been authorised.(Paragraph 6.)(g) A chart showing the output of aircraft from thebeginning of 1938 is attached (Appendix I).      (Paragraph 7.)32.    Aero-engines.Further steps have been taken to increase productivecapacity.      (Paragraph 0.)33-    Engine Accessories.,Steps have been taken to increase productivecapacity for De Havilland airscrews and B.T.H. magnetos.(Paragraph 10.)34.    Guns and Ammunition.(a) Arrangements have been made to increase the outputof Vickers 11K&quot; guns from 1 ,250 to 2,000 a month.    (Paragraph 11.)(b) Arrangements are being made to increase the productionOf 20 mm.  cannon guns to 1,500 guns a month.      (Paragraph 12.)(c) Appendix II shows the estimated requirements,together with the deliveries to date, of machine guns andcannon guns.      (Paragraph 13).(d) There will be a serious shortage of .303&quot; ammunition for machine guns for some while. This matter is under urgent consideration.      (Paragraph 1h9)/(e)

(e)     Provisional estimates of requirements for 20 mm.ammunition for cannon guns have been communicated to the Ministryof Supply as a bacls for the planning of additional capacity.(Paragraph 15).35.      Turrets.Adequate capacity for the production of Boulton Pauland Fraser Nash turrets is being obtained by extensive sub-contracting,  coupled with the association of large engineeringfirms with the firms which have hitherto been responsible forthe development and production of turrets.    (Paragraphs 16 to 18)36.      Balloon Barrage.The rate of output of- balloons planned in peace isbeing increased fourfold in order to maintain a larger barragesystem.      (Paragraph 19).37.     Raw Materials.(a) Aluminium and light alloy requirements are set out inAppendix-III.      (Paragraphs 20 and 21.)(b) The construction of three new light alloy tubefactories has been approved.     The possibility of substitutingsections drawn from strip for extruded sections is being examined and consideration is being given to the possibility of acquiringcertain extrusion presses in the course of manufacture for othercountries.    (Paragraph 22).(c) The Ministry of Supply have been asked to make thenecessary arrangements to secure the spruce required for theaircraft programme.    (Paragraph 23).(d) Requirements of plywood during the first year of warwill probably be met and a small surplus should be availabletowards the requirements of the second year.      (Paragraph 24).(e) A statement of steel requirements has been sent tothe Ministry of Supply as a basis for providing any additionalproductive capacity necessary.    (Paragraph 25).

(Paragraph 96*)(b) If the programme is to be achieved it is clear thatsuch measures as considerable dilution of labour and theemployment of women on a much larger scale than at presentwill probably be required to be introduced soon.      The principleof taking work to available labour will be further extended.(Paragraph 27*..)(c) Appendix IV shows the actual and estimated recruit-ment of labour for aircraft production.
