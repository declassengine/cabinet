This Analysis of German Propaganda cnversthe period November 15th to 30th.The arrangement follows the same lines asthe previous Analysis.      German propaganda, by wireless, press and cable, is divided inti anumber of lines which are sufficiently stable tprovide a basis for comparioon.Firstly, a short summary is made rf the major trends of propaganda during the part fortnight.A brief description is then given ofeach -f these lines with some indication 6ftheir relative importance in German propagandadirected to    l) the German home population;2i) Great Britain;    3) France and   h) neutral countries.      In the margin beside each itemare placed percentage figures showing its com-parative importance in relation to the totalpropaganda in each of these four directions.In brackets after each figure is shown thecorresponding percentage for the previousfortnight.A table is then given summarising therelative importance of these various lines of propaganda.Finally, there is given in an Appendix asummary account of a number of leaflets whichwere recently distributed by the enemy inFrance,

The main pattern -f German Propaganda is essentially unchanged0      The following modifi-nations, however, have &quot;been noticed since thelast Analysis.      Anti-British propaganda has considerably increased.,      At the same timeGermany is abandoning her tenderness fur Frenchinterests and has become more critical ofFranoe.      But Britain still remains nearly tentimes snore important than France as a targetfir German animosity,.The principal lines of propaganda arenow, in *rder of their importance:l)    British Weakness,2)    British Brutality and Unscrupulousness3)    Britain the Enemy of Neutrals;k)    German Strength;5)    Britain Lies.By comparison with the previous Analysisit will be seen that &quot;British Weakness&quot; hasreplaced &quot;German Strength&quot; as the principalitem;    and that &quot;Britain the Enemy of Neutrals&quot;has gained considerably in importance.

This is mostremarkable in the case of propaganda for home consumption.      The main stress is laid on german air strength and her power of resist-ance to the Blockade , but there is a notablereliance upon the expected resistance ofItaly and Japan to &quot;British piracy&quot;.      the anticipated Russo-Japanese rapprochement isregarded as a future source of embarrassmentfor Great Britain.

The theme has greatlyincreased in importance during the last fort-night owing to the mine controversy and the consequent British Order in Council decreeingthe confiscation of German exports.      GreatBritain, it is said, has &quot;declared war on the neutrals&quot; and it is represented that theBritish reprisals will affect neutral count-ries far more than Germany, who, owing to herContinental connections, is immune to theeffects of such a menace.      Great Britain is charged with attempting to reduce neutral countries to the status of dependent Dominions

The alleged sinking of the&quot;Dcutschland&quot; and capture of Captain Priori v/eruexploited in the same manner.      It is suspectedthat many of these rumours have their originwithin the German Propaganda Ministry itself.An important charge against tin; veracityof British information is the supposed suppressioor falsification of naval losses by the BritishAdmiralty.      Popular examples during the part fortnight have been the alleged sinking&apos; of the&quot;Belfast&quot;  and an unnamed cruiser of the &quot;London&quot;class.There has been a decline in the use ofthis line of propaganda  to German audiences.The principle topic has been the Commentary ofthe German Government on the British Blue Book,quoted to neutrals more than to the Allies, andto Germany comparatively little..

In the propaganda to Great Britain the emphasis has shifted froma comparison of the two systems to a destructiveanalysis of the British social order.      to france , where the attack is new, the emphasis,on the other hand, is laid on the contrastbetween the National-Socialist and the Democra-tic-Capitalist economic systems.      Certainlines to Prance are practically indistinguish-able from Communist propaganda.      For home consumption the subject is largely confined tothe Press and may be summed up by a quotationfrom an article by Dr.  Ley:    &quot;We were on thehigh road to success as regards solving thesocial question.

9    :r)- ik -APPENDIXGERMAN PAMPHLET PROPAGANDA INTENDED FOR THE FRENCH.Most of the German pamphlets that have comeinto our hands since the beginning of the war have been addressed to the French.    Their toneis generally anti-British,  stressing Germany&apos;sstrength and her desire for friendship with france.      The following examples will illustratethis type of propaganda.1. A paper maple-leaf,  in autumn colours, was dropped behind the French lines.    It carriedthe verse:&quot;AUTUMN.&quot;The leaves fall,&quot;We fall like them.&quot;The leaves fall because God wills it.&quot;But we, we fall because the English wish us to.&quot;In the coming spring no-one will remember&quot;either the dead leaves or the fallen poilus.&quot;Life will pass over our graves...&quot;2. A leaflet,  intended for the French troops,contained an extract from an article by Bonapartein the  &apos;Moniteur Universel&apos;  of 1801.    It wasprefaced by the words:&quot;French soldiers!    You are astonished because&quot;we Germans  judge England so severely,  and ask why&quot;we believe that only England will be responsible&quot;if France and Germany cannot be friends.    You&quot;are astonished that we say in Germany that England

1*1 (u -J&quot;Is this time again determined to fight to the&quot;last Frenchman.      In reality great Frenchmen&quot;have never thought otherwise ...&quot;3- A small &quot;booklet of 28 pages, containingphotographs of the Siegfried Line and diagramsillustrating the material superiority of the germany of 1939 over France and Britain, andover the Germany of 191A.      They are prefacedby a number of alleged quotations by Englishpublic men, from Warren Hastings to Lord Baldwin,of which the following is a typical example:&quot;In order to destroy Hitlerism England will&quot;fight to the last Pole and - if inland is&quot;destroyed - to the last Frenchman.     (Winston&quot;Churchill, in a secret session of the British War&quot;Cabinet, on September 2nd, 1939.)&quot;A. A leaflet, dropped from a balloon, containing a number of extracts from Herr Hitler&apos;s speech to the Reichstag on October 6th.      Each passageis headed by the phrase &quot;Hitler,  in his peace-speech, has said:&quot;    The appeal is addressed to&quot;French Soldiers.&apos;    French People!&quot;5, Another leaflet, dropped by accident inSwitzerland,  contains an extract from Herr vonRibbentrophs speech on October 20th, describingHerr Hitler&apos;s attempts to reach an agreement withM. Daladier in 1933-      The following comment ismade :&quot;Equally under the orders of England, the&quot;French Press has not been given the authority&quot;to publish these words concerning France which&quot;the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke at Danzig.

&quot;WHY?&quot;Since then Germany has made many attempts&quot;to reach an entente with Prance. Each time it&quot;was England who counteracted these efforts and&quot;prevented the entente.&quot;WILL IT BE ALWAYS SO?&quot;Early in November a pamphlet was dropped &quot;byaeroplane over Prance giving selected extracts from M. Molotov&apos;s speech on October 31st.    It washeaded:&quot;THE WAR AIM OF THE WESTERN POWERS IS CRIMINAL.German pamphlets dealing with the allegedBritish supply of poison gas to Poland have alsobeen translated into French and delivered throughthe post.
