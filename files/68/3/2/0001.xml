9ftSURVEY OF GERMAN PROPAGANDA1.   Broadcasting Propaganda.Until the latter part of the fortnight underreview there has &quot;been lamentable shortage of news to meetthe appetite of propaganda - a shortage not unnoticed inthis country, hut particularly afflicting for Dr. Goebbels,because such news as there has been has not been very pleasantfor him. Holotov&apos;s speech was much discussed in Germanbroadcasts, always, of course, with the aim of showing howcompletely satisfactory it was for Germany.    This theme wasinsisted upon rather too much to carry conviction, and thex^ewas a similar undertone of nervousness in the assertions,also repeated too often, that the Italian Cabinet changes have had no importance at all - or at any rate no unpleasantsignificance for Germany.    The removal of the so-called arms embargo in the U.S.A. naturally required some of Dr0Goebbel&apos;attention; he met the unfortunate event with reproaches tothe Americans and assurances to us that he will not allow usto import anything across the Atlantic.The Dutch-Belgian Peace Proposal, with Hitler&apos;sspeech at Munich and the attempt on his life (if that is what it was, which is by no means self-evident), have livened uptransmissions at the end of the fortnight.    Till then the oldthemes had been repeated in the continued Hymn of Hate against this country - &quot;the last French soldier1&apos;, who is surely almoston his last legs, the cracks in the British Empire (withreferences, naturally, to our difficulties with Congress inIndia), the hardships caused to neutrals by our blockade.There are three features of more interest than these. First,theMinistry of Information has taken up a flattering amount of dr. Goebbel&apos;s time (notably on Nov.1st) - it is remarkable

0 hi- 2 -that one institution should have deserved so much abusefrom friend and foe alike.Second, the greater amount of time given topropaganda talks, owing to the lack of news, has revealedsome curious researches into our history.Third, an increase of jamming from German stationshas interfered with some of our broadcasts and with those ofthe German Freedom Station.    There can be no clearerindication that propaganda is being effective than the enemy&apos;persistent attempts to stop it.2.   Newspaper PropagandaIt is interesting to compare German domestic presspropaganda with that given out by radio.    The study of anumber of German newspapers, bearing various dates in thelast five or six weeks, shows that the main trends are, as one would expect, the same in the two media.   There is thesame violence against Britain, the same almost condescendingaffectation of sympathy with deluded France, the sameassurances to the German people that Germany is too strongto be beaten.    Mixed with the unceasing abuse of thiscountry there are talks in which the utmost value isextracted from any references to our war discomforts and difficulties that have appeared in our own press.    John Bullis shown always with tin hat and gas-mask, symbols of abad conscience.    Our humorous and satirical press is quoted,without any understanding of our ability to laugh at our-selves and yet maintain a serious and stubborn resolution.It is worth noting that the large number of advertised enter-tainments suggests that it is considered important to keepthe people amused - the less butter with their bread,  themore &quot;circenses&quot;.

Illustrated papers , particularly the well-knownBerliner, Hamburger, and Meunchener Illustrirte aredistinguished by excellent photography and undoubtedlypossess a high propaganda value0    The physiciue and hearing of the German troops in some of the &quot;set-piece&quot; picturesare impressive, though the same cannot he said of theU-boat crew feted on their return from their exploit at scapa Flow.    But in general, the impression given by theillustrations of the German armed forces in action is oneof formidable and ruthless powerc    This is particularly soin the photographs, now some weeks old, of the Polishcampaign; the men photographed are, sometimes, obviouslyposing for the press-camera, but in other instances thephotographer seems to have been closer than usual to troopsin action, and there are hints, not without their value, ofthe training and tactical habits of German infantry.    Thesehints have, of course, been passed on to the right quarter.The only pictures dealing with the British andFrench forces are some photographs, with their captions in english, from back numbers of the Illustrated London News,of British warships which Dra Goebbels has sunk, and oneor two photographs of French prisoners, of v/hom (accordingto one of these illustrated papers) the Germans had capturednearly 700 by the middle of last month    Our own illustratedpress has given the German forces a better showing.It is alleged by neutral press correspondents inBerlin that they do not have to submit to any censorship atall, and that the only restriction imposed upon them is thatthey must not say anything against France^   Certainly on three occasions lately, twice to Switzerland and once to

- h -U.S.A., most unfavourable accounts of conditions in Berlinhave been sent by correspondents in that city.    There is reason to believe that these accounts are misleading, andthe motives of the German Government in sending them out,or allowing them to be sent out, must be matter forconjecture.
