Good progress is being made in thenegotiations with the Danish Government in London and withthose in Belgrade with the Yugoslav Government.      But thereis still nothing to show whether the Netherlands Governmentare prepared to conclude an agreement, and it has been nec-essary to inform them that His Majesty&apos;s Government mustinsist on a definitive answer.      The Turkish negotiations have proved very difficult but it is hoped to secure adefinite agreement preventing supplies of chrome going toGermany.      There are indications that the united statesGovernment may adopt a helpful attitude over the export ofcertain important alloys to the U.S.S.R, and Germany,      Anumber of useful agreements have been made with foreignshipping lines and other foreign firms to reduce contraband control delays.2.

received a letter from count ciano enclosing a completecatalogue of all the Italian ships detained by our contra-band controls since the beginning of the war.      These com-plaints are under examination.      The tone of Count ciano&apos;communication was friendly, but,  in sir Percy Loraine&apos;opinion, German interests in Italy are endeavouring, not without success, to make trouble by taunting signor Mussoliniwith the indignities to which Italian shipping is submitted.SPAIN17.    The possibility is being discussed in London ofa loan to Spain to liquidate a proportion of the clearingarrears, and of a credit for raw materials.      If these are agreed to, :&apos; v- should materially assist in securing a satis-factory war Trade Agreement0I80    Mr0 Cleminson, General Manager of the chamber ofShipping of the united Kingdom,  is proceeding to Madrid todiscuss the shipping question with the Spaniards,      He will endeavour to persuade them to utilise some portion of theirown shipping for trade with the United Kingdom,      The Ministryof Shipping have undertaken to lift a considerable portionof the orange crop if the Spaniards will agree to releaseBritish chips now held in Spanish harbours and will put theirown ships into service for the coal--iron ore trade between england and North Spain,19-    Major Campbell,  iron ore Controller, is also onhis way to Spain to conclude discussions which have been taking place on the price of Spanish ores and,  if possible,to start pur j ha 0Ing.20.

A draft rationing agreement--was-initialled byMr, Quandt and sir Frederick Leith-Ross on December li+thcA representative of the Hungarian office of Foreign trade has arrived to start negotiations regarding the quotas ofvarious-oomraodi:tie s.-to-he--imported by^un^ary^under-dJodsagreement.B U L G A R I A22.    one hundred tens of sunflower seed cake to a value of  7.000 have been purchased,YUGOSLAVIA23o    considerable progress has been made in the negotiating-negotiations for the purchase of Yugoslav minerals,  which arebeing conducted in Belgrade by Mr, Nixon, and it seems likely that an Agreement may be reached before Christmas.,      Mr, Nixonhas been authorised to agree to the immediate purchase ofcertain existing stocks of lead concentrates and. zinc con-centrates, and to conclude an agreement which should ensurethat for 19h0 the amount of essential metals available for germany will be not more, and in some cases less, than pre-warfigures.      In the course of the negotiations, which have been conducted in conjunction with French representatives, it hasbeen proposed that His Majesty5s Government and the FrenchGovernment should open separate Minerals Accounts in theirrespective Clearings,  into which the Yugoslav Governmentwill pay the amounts derived from sales of minerals andwhich will be liquidated by the value of the raw materials and armaments which are to be supplied in return by theBritish and French Governments,      The general effect of thisarrangement/

arrangement will be that the French Government will beresponsible for buying all Yugoslav copper, while HisMajesty&apos;s Government will buy the remaining minerals whichare principally chrome, Lead, zinc, Antimony and Aluminium.TURKEY2h. The negotiations with the Secretary General of theTurkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs have proved difficult.25c    As the result of a conversation between theChancellor of the Exchequer and M, Menemencoglu on December15th,  a draft basis of agreement was communicated to him inwhich it was proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Government and theFrench Government should undertake to buy  2,000,000 worth of raisins, figs and nuts a year on condition that agreement was reached on chrome and on the other war trade matters referred to in the Report of December lOtho26o    In response to this, M. Menemencoglu declared atan interview with the Minister of Economic warfare that hewas not competent to discuss a general war trade agreement in London and that in any case he would, not give anythingbut the chrome agreement in return for the proposed purchaseof dried fruit.      If a settlement could not be reached onthis basis he must return to Ankara with the proposed agree-ments unsigned,27. as M, Menemencoglu. was due to leave London forParis in any case on 17th December, the negotiations havebeen transferred to Paris,GREECE28,    His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Athens has reported thatthe Greek Government have given a reply which is favourablein principle to the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government fora definitive war trade agreement combined with undertakings,on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government,  to purchase a certainquantity/

examined; and were^siedhJ^o^girve-Jhi^^cargo.      Eventually the Japanese Embassy provided aNcopy\of the ship*s Manifest, which showed that nearly alignercargo was consigned to the Japanese army and navy,  or to firms under their control, and consisted mostly of mechanicalapparatus3 as well as a quantity of sulphate of potash.The Japanese Government also gave assurances that all thegoods of German origin on hoard had teen paid for before november 27th,  the date of the British Order-in-counciln32.    The &quot;Sanyo Maru&quot; eventually left Rotterdam on the15th December, and came into the Contraband Control Base inthe Downs for examination.      She was detained for 24 hours,and was then released after a formal verification that hercargo did not include any other goods of German origin not covered by the Japanese Government&apos;s guarantees.EGYPT33&quot;    The Egyptian Government have asked that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should agree to discuss with them thearrangements for the contraband control of Egyptian exports,principally Egyptian cotton,.        The Egyptian authoritiesappear to have in mind mainly the allotment of cotton quotasto neutral countries      They argue that the fixation ofthese cotton quotas on the basis of the average takings ofeach country during the past three seasons is unfair to egypt, because the internal demand in the countries con-cerned is now much greater than during recent years,UNITED STATES34o    president Roosevelt has secured, from the climaxCompany, the principal producer of Molybdenum, an under-taking not to ship for the time being any of this importantmaterial/

... i0 -material to Russia, japan and Germany via Russia; andMr. Morgenthau has asked His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador how much Great Britain and Prance would be likely to purchase in order to make up for the consequent contraction in theClimax company?s business.      Mr. Morgenthau has instructedhis advisers to co-operate with Mr. purvis of the Anglo-French purchasing Commission,  in a study of the whole subjectof alloys.      in co-operation with other departments, papershave been prepared on allied subjects of Molybdenum andTungsten supplies and these are to be discussed at a meetingof the Anglo-French co-ordination committee today:35.    The interest displayed by the secretary of theTreasury in the question whether Molybdenum and substitutealloys are essential to Germany for War,  and how long germany could carry on war without them, raises hopes that usefulassistance may be obtained through, the imposition of an embargo on those commodities which might possibly subsequently be extended to others of similar importance036.    on December 8th the IPS.. Charge dvAffaires addresseia note to Lord Halifax communicating his Government&apos;s viewsregarding the British Order-in-Council of November 27thauthorising action against enemy exports0      The note dealswith the possibility of the diversion of American ships, andof interference with innocent trade.
