Gold CoastTelegram No.408Secret 24th November1939.NigeriaTelegram No.776Secret 30th November1939.Sierra LeoneTelegram No.281Secret 25th November1939.Tanganyika TerritoryTelegram No. 371.Secret 30th October1939.    et seq,ti.PalestineTelegram No.1389Seer.15th November1939.Home Office letterGen. 200/6/421st November,1939.2.      Enemy Aliens.Arrangements have been made for theremoval to the United Kingdom of enemy aliensinterned in Nigeria and the Gold Coast.    Thoseinterned in Sierra Leone have already been removed and are on their way to the United Kingdom wherethey will either be interned or repatriated toGermany,  if the latter course is considered in individual cases desirable.    In TanganyikaTerritory a comprehensive review of the cases ofall enemy aliens has been undertaken by a specialadvisory committee, and as a result about 150 havebeen,  or are being, released, while 350 have beenclassified as belonging to the special categorieswhose return to Germany will not be permitted.    Afurther 500 are being repatriated together withtheir wives and children via Italy.    A suggestion made by the German Government that certain enemy aliens now detained in Palestine should be allowedto return to Germany in exchange for Palestiniansnow detained in Germany is under consideration inconsultation with the Foreign Office and the NighCommissioner.    Arrangements are being made for co-operation with the Prisoners of War InformationBureau in respect of enemy aliens detained in theColonial Empire.3.      Economic Measures.The economic control exercised by meansof finance regulations and export and import licensing

licensing continues to be developed and to work onthe whole smoothly.Defence Finance Regulations are now inforce in all Colonies.    The Governments of thelarger Colonies have called for returns of certainforeign securities and these are being forwarded tothis country in order that they may be examinedhere with a view to deciding whether it will be worth while at a later stage making any vestingorders.The question of devising satisfactorymeans to secure the foreign exchange resulting from colonial exports without dislocating the existing machinery of trade,  is still under consideration.It is understood that the export licensing system is working satisfactorily from the pointof view of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, and goods bearing Colonial export licences are letthrough the Contraband Control with little or nodelay.    Colonial Governments are still referringa very large number of individual applications fo 1export licences to the Colonial Office, but thisshould diminish as the weeks go on,  since&quot;rationing&quot; systems are being worked out underwhich Colonial Governments will grant at their discretion export licences for various commodities to &quot;contiguous&quot; European neutrals up to a givenmonthly maximum.    Such quota systems necessarily take

take some time to evolve.      Interim rationingarrangements have already been made for oilseeds from the Far East and for citrus fruit,and it is hoped that a system will shortly be worked out for rubber.Import control is in force in the majorityof Colonies, but in one or two it still has to beintroduced.      Colonial Governments have been instructed to administer the system in a liberalspirit to begin with and to avoid dislocation oftrade in the initial stages by free use of open general licences.      Unlike financial and export control, however, import control has given rise toa certain number of difficulties.      The canadian government have made informal representations withregard to the imposition of the control in the west indies, with which the Dominion has, of course,unusually close commercial relations:    as a resultof these representations,  telegrams have been sentto the West Indian Governments and it is expectedthat the complaints of the Canadian Government willbe to a large extent redressed.      In West africa the imposition of the import licensing system has given rise to complaints by the Joint West AfricaCommittee of the London, Liverpool and ManchesterChambers of Commerce, who alleged that colonial governments had not taken the local commercialcommunity into adequate consultation beforeintroducing the system:    steps have been taken toensure

ensure that close liaison is maintained between theWest African Governments and the trading community.The arrangements for the purchase of theWest African cocoa crop, mentioned in the lastreport, are now being put into effect.      a moratorium was declared in West Africa and furtherfirst-hand purchases of cocoa were suspended till the 4th of December, in order to enable a record tobe made of all stocks in the hands of exporters.The Nigeria ground-nut crop is now movingand arrangements for dealing with the Gambia ground-nut crop are in hand.The quota release of rubber for the first quarter of 1940 has been increased to 80% in order trelease extra supplies, and discussions have been initiated with the British owners of rubberplantations with a view to ensuring that adequate supplies are sent to the United Kingdom.The tin quota for the first quarter of1940 has been fixed at 100% of the standard tonnagesThe arrangements regarding sisal mentionedin the last monthly report have been put into effect the Palestine citrus growers have securedsufficient shipping to ensure the despatch oforanges for the Christmas trade, but a good deal ofanxiety is felt regarding the movement of the restof the crop, particularly owing to the demands ofthe Spanish and Greek Governments that largeproportions of their crops should be taken by the

^ United Kingdom.      The sale of a large proportion ofthe citrus crop is a matter of great importance inthe economy of Palestine, and I am in touch with theother departments concerned with a view tofacilitating this to the utmost extent possible inpresent circumstances.4.      Social Services...Mr. P. A, Norman, O.B.E., Labour adviser to the Government of Jamaica, attended the secondRegional Conference of American States Members ofthe International Labour Organization as an observeren behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom,,5.      Finance.Action is proceeding in regard to themeasures for wartime taxation referred to in theprevious report, but it is not yet possible topresent a comprehensive picture of the new burdensbeing assumed by colonial taxpayers.PART 2.

The only legitimate son,Mutesa, aged 15, has been unanimously elected assuccessor by the Lukiko (the native Parliament ofBuganda).      The election has been confirmed on behalfof His Majesty&apos;s Government.Tanganyika.There has been a serious outbreak ofrinderpest and it is suspected of having spread, to northern Rhodesia.      Conferences of the veterinaryofficers of the territories concerned have been heldin Tanganyika and representatives of the territoriessouth of the Zambesi were present at a Conferenceheld at Lusaka.      Measures are being undertakenurgent^ to control the outbreak and stamp out the disease.     All Colonial Governments concerned are co-operating in these measures and the Governments ofthe Union of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia and the bechuanaland Protectorate are assisting by lendingveterinary staff.Tanganyika telegram During October the British Association ofNo. 328 of 5thOctober and Tanganyika forwarded a resolution expressing the hopesubsesiUen- correspondence.        that His Majesty&apos;s Government would forthwith abolish(the Mandate and establish complete union betweenKenya, Uganda and Tanganyika.      The Governor was informed that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s GoVcriimentwith regard to the Mandate remained the same as beforethe

the war.      As regards policy after the war, it wasimpossible to make any statement.     The answerreturned to the Association was an expression of thanks for their message of loyalty and a statement that His Majesty&apos;s Government had noted their views with regard to the Mandate and future constitutional status of the Territory and would keep these viewsfully in mind.7.      WEST INDIES.Trinidad.Trinidad The Government of Trinidad have made a gifttelegram No.  371of 9th November      of 1 million dollars ( 208,333) to His Majesty&apos;s1939-. --Secret.Government for war expenditure.Uriah - Butler, who was released from prisonin May of this year after serving a sentence of twoTrinidad telegramNo. 396 secret        years1  imprisonment with hard labour on a charge ofof 24th November1939 et seqq.        sedition, has now been detained und.er the defence regulations.      The Governor reported that his activities among the v/orkers in the Trinidad oilfieldswere such as to constitute an immediate and seriouspublic danger&apos;, with the consequent risk of a breakdown in the supply of this essential material.M:r. Butler was expelled from the local trade union ashort while ago, and was working up his agitation in defiance of the union leaders.      He has now gone ona hunger strike, and the Governor has authority toarrange for his forcible feeding.8.      MEDITERRANEAN.^altar telegram;!0-l21 of 2nd-jovember 19391 seqq.Gibraltar.At the beginning of October, Dr. Braimir geOVica

f 39*d oa Croat who is suspected of having been implicated inthe assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia in france, was removed at Gibraltar from the &quot;Conte diSavoia&quot;  on his way from America to Italj^.      this action was taken as the result of strong representations by the Yugoslav Government, and Jelicwas detained under the Defence Regulations.      It was understood that the Yugoslav Government were goingto apply for his extradition, but they pleaded thatthis might cause political and racial difficulties in yugoslavia, and asked whether he could not be detained indefinitely under the Defence Regulations.Finally,  they promised to provide material which mightjustify his detention, but also to instituteextradition proceedings in Yugoslavia so that, if itwas felt in Gibraltar that the material provided wasnot sufficient to justify his detemtion there, theextradition proceedings could then go ahead.The position now is that the materialprovided by the Yugoslav Government is beingconsidered ^oy the Foreign Office and Colonial Office.However, it will not be possible to hold Dr. Jelicmuch longer;    he has already been refused a writ ofhabeas corpus, but an appeal is now being made on his behalf for his case to be heard by an AdvisoryCommittee, as provided for in the Defence Regulations.9.      FAR EAST.Ceylon..The proposed trade negotiations between theGovernment of Cej^lon and the Government of India weredeferred

deferred pending a settlement of differences arisingout of the Ceylon. Governments attitude towards their non-Ceylonese employees.      The exchange of views which has since been proceeding between the twoGovernments has resulted, in some narrowing of theissue at dispute, but at the time of writing theprospect of reaching final agreement has receded.Meanwhile the Government of India&apos;s ban on emigrationof Indian labourers to Ceylon continues.Hong Kong^On the 8th of November the Imperial Airwaysaeroplane &quot;Dardanus&quot;,  en route to Bangkok from HongKong, was attacked by Japanese fighter aircraftwithout preliminary warning whilst flying at a height of 4,000 feet about 10 miles south of the island ofWeichow in the Gulf of Tonkin, and obliged to make aforced landing&apos; at a Japanese aerodrome on the Island.The crew and passengers were taken to Canton byaeroplane, and there detained by the Japanese naval authorities for three and a half days before being allowed to see officials of the British ConsulateGeneral.      Upon their release apologies were made bythe local Japanese authorities, but His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Tokyo has been instructed to lodge anofficial protest.10.      MIDDLE EAST.Aden Protectorate^On the 17th of November Royal Air Forceaeroplanes took air action against certain tribes inthe Protectorate who were charged with nine crimesincluding

(including six murders, one wounding, and thediverting of water channels.      They have been mainly responsible for the insecurity of the trade routebetween Balihaf and the interior and have ignoredrepeated representations and refused to submitafter three months warning.The action was taken with the approval ofthe local Sultan and the damage inflicted was confined to buildings.      One tribe has now submittedand signed a truce.      Further information is awaitedregarding the other.During the operations one Royal Air Forcemachine made a forced landing.      The pilot and crew were later found shot, apparently by local tribesmen;,and the aircraft burnt.      Their bodies have beenrecovered.      Investigations are being pressed with aview to apprehending the individual tribesmenconcerned.Aden-Kfemcnt Prentier.It was suggested in a telegram dated the14th of July from His Majesty the King to the King ofthe Yemen that,  if the King of the Yemen consideredthe time had come, he should, approach the governor of Aden with a view to negotiations being enteredinto for settling the southern frontier of the Yemen,in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty ofSana5a, 1934.    Yemeni representatives have now- -a telegram arrived in /den to initiate discussions.. - 2S? ofI    -&apos;&apos;-K; -&apos;ctooer, The King of the Yemen is mainly concernedI   &quot;&quot; -    3t seqq.

PalestinetelegramNo. 1434 of with Shabwa and Al Ahr;    he claims that these places havebelonged to the Yemen since time immemorial.The village of Shabwa and the wells and xoost atAl Ahr are of considerable value to us from the points ofview of security and c omrnunications since they form thegateway to the Uadhramaut from the north-west and the yemen.      Al Abr is also claimed by the Qu&apos;aiti Sultan ofMukalla, one of the principal Arab rulers in the aden protectorate, as part of his dominions and has been occupied by a permanent garrison of Oyulaiti troops for some two years past.Palestine and Trans-Jordan.In October and at beginning of November Arabviolence in the shape of banditry showed a tendency tc30th November,1959. Secret,  increase, especially in Samaria district;    but prompt and effective military action in which two local leaders were killed has tended to check lawlessness and to restore localconfidence in Government,,    The last two weeks of Novemberhave been the quietest for two years.    Isolated banditryon a small scale continues and will probably continue tobe endemic, but the High Commissioner reports thatorganized rebellion is practically dead, and the remainingbandits who are mostly outlaws are being looked on by thebulk of the population more as a public nuisance than as national heroes as was once the case.      There is alsooutwardly a better and more confident spirit and an evidentdesire for peace amongst the Arab public;    this was  particularly evident from the more carefree celebration inmost centres of the feast at the end of Ramadan and was increased by the release of detainees on the occasion ofthat

that feast.       There are also some signs of resumptionof Arab-Jewish commercial relations.This improvement amongst the Arabs may beexpected to continue unless circumstances make possiblethe organization of further activities from outside PaPalestine and so long as our security forces continue todeal successfully with banditry and terrorism.    Popularfeeling would not offer the same response as in the pastto an attempt to revive rebellion,    but there is real danger that unemployment and bad economic conditionsgenerally among the Arab population might induce many to resort to lawlessness as a means of subsistence.The Jewish community is very much preoccupied with its unsatisfactory economic state, and is muchdivided internally.    Unemployment is serious, there havebeen clashes between rival labour organisations andpicketing against Arab and blackleg Jewish labournecessitating police intervention.      A strike wasthreatened by Jewish school teachers whose salaries,paid by the Vaad Leumi, were 3 months in arrears.Confirmation, with a reduction of sentences,by the General Officer Commanding of the conviction of43   Jews who had been arrested in October while carryingout illegal military training under arms, provokedwidespread but, though carefully fostered, lukewarmJewish reaction.        There was a two hour stoppage of jewish work the next morning and that night Jewishplaces of entertainment were closed;    but no disturbanceoccurred.A

A second i^arty of Jews were arrested on the18th of November for similar illegal activities.    Theyawait trial, but their case is unlikely to attract thesame Jewish sympathy or provoke reaction, as they are apparently Revisionists and generally unpopular as such;and in any case they are believed to have been actingagainst their party&apos;s orders.The food position throughout the country has become normal and has ceased to give cause forapprehension.The situation in Trans-Jordan is reported to benormal.M, 1.1.Richmond Ter race,S.W.1.6th December,  1939.
