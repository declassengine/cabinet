Copy No.    1+0]r fWAR CaBINSTINDIAFORTNIGHTLY REPORT submitted by the Secretary offor India covering the period 16oh to 30th November1939.&quot;(previous Report - Paper W.P.(R) (39) 35)I.    GENERAL.There is little to report on the general politicalsituation.   The resignation of the Ministries in seven ofthe eight Congress Provinces and tne issue by the governors of those provinces of proclamations underSection 93 has now been followed by the resignation ofthe Congress Coalition Ministry in Assam also.    In that province, however, the Moslem premier whose resignationhad previously made way for the Congress Coalition has nowagain formed a Ministry.   How long it will survive the   .next meeting of the Legislature, which has been postponed until towards the end of January in order to enable thenew Premier to consolidate his position, remains to be seer/So far there has been no active opposition in anyProvince to the administration of the Governors.    On 23rdNovember the Congress Working Committee issued anotherlong statement of which a telegraphic summary has beenseparately circulated.    In this they endorsed the decisioncontained in the letter from the Congress President to theGovernor-General (published earlier in the month) in whichSIXTHState

- 2 -1 ft &amp;10 jtlie refused, in the absence of an undertaking by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the sense the Congress has beendemanding, to consider any plans for co-operation such asthose which the Governor-General had suggested.   this statement enlarges upon the idea of a Constituent Assemblyas being the only adequate instrument for solvingcommunal and other difficulties, and states the willing -ness of Congress to withdraw its decision to withholdco-operation the moment the British Government shows signs of readiness to make an &quot;honourable settlement&quot;.The statement further insists on the absolute necessityof avoiding all violence.   Even the Congress press inIndia appears to have given this statement a somewhatmixed reception, and to have expressed doubts whether a constituent assembly will in fact be found to be thepanacea which it is claimed to be.There has been some communal trouble in Sind.   Alocal dispute led to the eviction on 18th November ofMoslems who had occupied a former mosque in the city ofSukkur.    This was done by the Police,who used tear gasin the operation, without much trouble, but the same evening communal rioting broke out in the city in whichthere were several deaths and which spread to two othercities in the province and later to certain of the districts.    Troops were called in but martial law was notimposed.    The position gave anxiety for some days but by28th news was more favourable and the latest telegramssuggest that the trouble is subsiding.    Troops areremaining for the present.    The Sind Ministry are aMoslem-Hindu coalition, and the province is largelyMoslem.   Hindus are found for the most part in the towns.I am awaiting further reports but from the telegrams Iget the impression that the trouble, though serious, is

local and there has been no suggestion of its spreadingoutside the limited area hitherto concerned.IT.

IV.    INDIAN states the general situation in the Indian States remainscalm, although there is evidence of intention to renewagitation against the Rulers of the States bordering onOrissa Province where a considerable amount of Congress-inspired rioting has occurred in the past year.   Reformsannounced in Mysore and Rajkot, where Congress-inspiredagitation hod led to the appointment of committees toconsider means of associating the subjects more closely with the decisions of the executive, include provisionfor the appointment of a proportion of Ministers who arenon-officials, drawn from the State legislatures.    Ofthese the powers have been enhanced and the represent-ative character increased.   These reforms have been welcomed by moderate elements but do not satisfyCongress circles.    In Travancore it has been foundnecessary to arrest the leaders of the local Congressmovement and in Mysore also a number of Congresssympathisers are reported to be under detention.There is considerable communal feeling betweenBrahmin and non-Brahmin Hindus in the minor states which lie in the south of Bombay Presidency where theofficial class is largely recruited from the Brahminelement.    An extremist Moslem party, the Khaksars, whohave been active in the United provinces are nowcollecting volunteers in certain of the Rajputana States.Many of the Aajputana and Western India States are suffering severely from the failure of the Monsoon.Crops and fodder are seriously deficient and evendrinking water is scarce in the villages.   Specialfamine relief measures have been put into force in which

in some States tne Congress elements have readily co-operated .More States troops are under orders to leave fortraining and service with the British forces in british india.   The Nizam of Hyderabad&apos;s gift of  100,000 has beenutilised by the Air Ministry towards the raising of aBomber Squadron located in the north of England which isto be known as the Hyderabad Squadron.In Hyderabad the Nizam proposes to accept the resignation of Sir Akbar Hydarl from the post of president of the State Executive Council, principally on grounds of i11-hea1th.V.

The sterling resources of the reserve bank of India have been further strengthened since thismatter was last mentioned; on the 17th November the totalhoiding (13sue and Banking Departmtints combined) was 24 million higher than on the 18th August.The Viceroy&apos;s War Purposes Fund.The Viceroy opened this Fund some two months agowith the intention of providing an objective for thespontaneous and loyal offers of service and assistance made so generously throughout India on the outbreak of the war.Donations offered and paid into the Fund have alreadyexceeded Rs.60 lakhs ( 450,000).    Some of the so donations

have been made for specific purposes, such as for the for comforts for the troops serving in India and abroad,for the relief of those who are wounded, blinded and disabled in war and for the dependants of those who arekilled.    All such donations will be applied according tothe wishes of the donors.
