o 1WEEKLY REPORT ON ACTION TAKENI. WAR TRADE AGREEMENTS AND RELATIONS WITH NEUTRAL countries there were no outstanding events during this week.      It hasnot yet &quot;been possible to sign the Swedish -/ar Trade Agreement.Good, progress is being made with the negotiations with theBelgian Delegation, but those with the Netherlands Delegationhave been disappointing.      It is hoped that negotiations witha Danish Delegation will begin shortly in London.2.    The situation in the various countries is briefly asfollows:-Sweden3.    Negotiations are still proceeding satisfactorily and,in particular,  substantial progress has been made in drafting the &quot;Instructions to the Standing Commission&quot;.      In addition toa number of points of detail,  the following questions of principleare still outstanding:-(a) The extent to which we shall be able to maintain our normal imports of Swedish goods in war-time conditions.      The President of the Board of trade has indicated that it will be necessary to qualifyto some extent the undertaking on this question for which the Swedes have asked.(b) The extent to which the Swedes may be permittedwithin the limits of their normal trade:-(i)  to send prohibited raw materials to germany for processing and return to Sweden,  and(ii)to deliver certain prohibited raw materials to Germany in compensation for like quanti-ties of such raw materials consumed by theGermans in manufacturing goods (and parti-cularly electrical machinery) for sale to sweden.Both these principles,  and particularly the latter,  areobnoxious to us.

(c)   The method of regulating financial transactionsbetween the two countries, particularly in regardto payments due from the United Kingdom to sweden.      This question is the subject of specialnegotiations between the Bank of England and theRiksbank.4.    The representative of the Swedish Mission who deals withshipping questions is expected back in this country very shortlywith the final Swedish comments upon the Shipping Agreement, whichmay be regarded as favourable to us and as now virtually settled.The Swedes are not willing to sign it until the dar trade agreement is signed, but the Chairman of the Swedish Missionbelieves that Swedish shipping will be operated in accordancewith its terms immediately the draft is finally settled.Norway5.    It was hoped that the Norwegian Shipping Agreement wouldbe ratified by the Shipowners Club on the 20th November.Meanwhile,  the Norwegian Government have stated that they reserve the right to cancel the Shipping Agreement should a War trade agreement not be concluded in a reasonable time.      Note has beentaken of this communication.6.    The Norwegian Government at the same time informed HisMajesty&apos;s Government that the German negotiators were arriving in Oslo this week, and urged His Majesty&apos;s Government to send arepresentative to Oslo to explore the basis for a  :/ar trade agreement.      The representative was to arrive in Oslo on the20th November and the Norwegian Government have been informedthat he is sent on the understanding that his mission isexploratory,  and that the negotiations proper must take placein London.Iceland7.    The Icelandic Delegation replied on November 15th tothe/

the proposals contained in Sir George Mounsey&apos;s letter ofNovember 8th informing them that His Majesty&apos;s government intended to exercise their full belligerent rights in the controlof Icelandic trade.      The Icelandic reply protested that suchaction would be incompatible with Iceland&apos;s rights according to international Law, since her exports were all conditional andnot absolute contraband.      The Icelandic Government were thereforeunable to sign any agreement which would directly or indirectlybind them to give up their normal trade with Germany.      Attachedto the letter was a memorandum dealing with certain trade questions which would arise in the event of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment preventing Iceland from exporting goods to Germany.8.    While there seems to be no prospect of Iceland signinga War Trade Agreement,  it looks as if the door were wide open for the successful negotiation of a modus Vivendi of an officialnature.Denmark9-    A Danish Government delegation is arriving on the 2hthNovember 1939 in London,  to start conversations with HisMajesty&apos;s Government for a War Trade Agreement.Finland10.    A Finnish Delegation is expected to arrive in London atthe end of the current or the beginning of next month,  tocontinue the conversations for a War Trade Agreement.Baltic States11.    There is nothing of importance to report.Belgium12.    The Anglo-Belgian and Franco-Belgian negotiations havenow reached a stage where the three Governments hope to concludeshortly provisional War Trade Agreements and put into force the agreed lists of prohibited and partly prohibited exports,leaving/

- u -leaving a certain number of items for further discussion.      Asthe lists drawn up in Paris are much less complete than thosedrawn up in London,  the United Kingdom negotiators are pressing that the London lists should be adopted in the caseof both War Trade Agreements.The Netherlands13.    Very little progress has been made in the War trade negotiations with the Netherlands.      The Netherlands Delegationcontinue to be hampered by the lack of instructions.      They are accordingly returning to The Hague to put the present position before their Government.      There is reason to fear that theNetherlands Government may after all refuse to conclude anagreement on the ground that strict rationing by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is preferable to the loss of their merchant shipsthrough U-boats.Hungary.1A.    At an informal meeting with Mr. Quandt of the NationalBank of Hungary on November 18th a fresh step was taken inexploring the ground for a war trade arrangement with the hungarian Government principally in the sphere of an agreedrationing system for raw materials.      It is proposed, before mr.  Quandt&quot;s return to Hungary at the end of the week,  to extend the scope of these exploratory conversations.Rumania15-      Mr.  Bridgeman of the Ministry of Economic Warfare ison his way to Rumania,  accompanied by a Treasury representative,to investigate the best means of organising purchases ofpetroleum for the United Kingdom,  or other approved destinations,in order to reduce the supplies available to Germany.Yugoslavia16.    A decree providing for the control of mineralproduction and distribution in Yugoslavia has now been issued.A Commissariat/

Cf, ft.A Commissariat is to be established which will prepare a compulsory programme for increasing and accelerating production,and determine the destination, date,  amount and consignees forall deliveries of mining and smelting products.    There is a danger that under this decree attempts may be made to force theforeign-owned companies to deliver a larger proportion of their output to Germany.Italy-17-    Before Mr.  Rodd left Rome on 11th November a meetingof the Anglo-Italian Joint Standing Committee took place in adistinctly less favourable atmosphere,accounted for by largenumbers of complaints of the treatment of Italian ships andby the evaporation of the orders which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwas apparently going to place in Italy.      The substance of the complaints was that nothing had been done of the many plansdiscussed to ameliorate and speed up the control of shipping inso far as the Italians were concerned.      Negotiations on theAnglo-Italian clearing were also brought to a standstill because we were unable to produce even a rough estimate of expenditurein Italy,  in the absence of any indications from the service departments and Ministry of Supinly.      This situation has nowbeen remedied by the acceptance by the Naval Authorities ofsome modifications of the Contraband Control organisation in theMediterranean, designed to avoid certain real difficulties andthe production,  as a result of recent Cabinet decisions,  ofrough estimates by the interested Departments of possibleexpenditure in Italy.18.     In general there has been a marked development ofco-operation in Italy giving guarantees in connection withimports.^Jetugai19.    There is nothing to report.Spain/

0 0Spain20.    Mr.  Eccles,  Ministry of Economic Warfare representative on the Delegation to Spain, had a meeting in Paris on November12th, on his way to Spain, with officials of the French ForeignOffice and other Departments.      He discussed with them general lines of policy in connection with trade negotiations with spain and it was arranged that contact should be established in Madridbetween the Delegation and the French financial expert who is making preliminary enquiries there.21.    The Delegation arrived in Madrid early in the week.They report that they are in close co-operation with the french representatives.      Enquiries have been received from them as tothe possibility of supplying to Spain sulphate of ammonia and tin.Egypt22.    The Egyptian Government has now been informed that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are prepared to buy cotton at current pricesup to a maximum of 155,000,000 lbs.  a year.23-    Efforts are being made to sequestrate German stocks ofnitrates.afghanistan spanIran &apos; &quot;2U.    Discussions are taking place regarding the purchase ofcotton, wool and other commodities to prevent such goods reachingGermany.Japan25-    No change to report.-Ui-^Ai^and South.Ameriea26,    Arrangements for the institution of a Navicert systemnave made further progress,  and it seem!? provable that the system will start to operate on December 1st,,  in the United States.Argentina;  Brazil and Uruguay,  if agreement can be reached withthe/

the Treasury about the fees to be charged.2?.    Further steps have been taken to investigate thepossibility of negotiating agreements which would give ussome control over the exports of cotton from America to neutral countries.28.    The Section has also been much occupied with routinequestions connected with the application of Trading with theEnemy legislation in overseas countries.      It is becomingapparent that reference to London of every case where legallya Secretary of State&apos;s dispensation is required is likely to inflict more damage on British than on German trade;    and thegrant of discretion in these matters to His Majesty&apos;s Missionsabroad will be considered as soon as the necessary powers canbe obtained from the Board of Trade or the Foreign Office.II.     CONTRABAND CONTROL29-    During the week ending- November 18th,  131 new casesof ships were dealt with and &quot;Jlx previous cases,   in regard th whose cargoes or items thereof enquiries had been completed,were disposed of,30,    In only one case was an entire cargo seized whilstin HA cases entire cargoes were released,  either on firstconsideration or after enquiries.      In 20 cases,  part cargoeswere seized and the remaining items released.31-    The policy was continued, whenever practicable,  of allowing ships to unload in this country items of cargo detained for enquiry;,  or to continue their voyage with such items onboard,  on their owners guaranteeing to &quot;hold&quot; them until adecision was reached and.,  if required,   to return them to theUnited Kingdom,  thereby lessening the periods ships would havehad to have been detained at the Contraband Control Bases orPorts of call.

32.    The system under which advance copies of manifests of cargoes are received and considered prior to the ships&apos;arrival at ports in this country resulted, during the week underreview,  in 31 cases being so dealt with and in 20 cases in theships concerned &quot;being released by the Committee,  subject merely to the formal checking of the original manifests on their arrival at the Control Bases.      In addition to these immediatereleases,  in 28 other cases the Committee&apos;s decision to releasewas given within 5 days or less of the arrival of ships at theControl Bases.
