(r)  (59) 72).1, The equipment of Civil Defence Services has &quot;been slowed down to some extent this month by the demands of the Fighting services on productive capacity and raw materials.    Considerable progress has however again been made, despite the reduced deliveries ofcertain items.2. The most serious reduction has been in the deliveries of steel shelters, the rate of supply having fallen this month by12-^S.    This has been wholly due to the requirements of the   Expeditionaryforce for similar material,,    In all, however, 170,000 shelters havebeen issued this month to householders and a start has been made withsales to individuals not entitled to free issue.    But the unsatisfieddemand is large.3, Sandbag production in this country has been considerablycurtailed to meet the Army requirements for this material forCamouflage work.    Large supplies are on order from India for deliveryearly next year.4. The acute shortage of softwood timber has necessitated a review by my Headquarter and Regional Technical Advisers of the methodaof shelter construction to provide for the use. wherever possible, of alternative materials such as steel,, concrete and brick.   A strictDepartmental control of the supply of timber for A.R.P. purposeshas also been set up in the Civil Defence Regions in association withthe Area Officers of the Timber Control.5, Deliveries of the many items of equipment for issue tothe public and to A.R.P. personnel have been up to programme estimates.The larger part of the essential requirements, except the children and babies types of respirators, have now been met.   Much increased supplies of these two items have however been produced this month.6. A start has been made with the supply of uniform for A.R.P.workers - overalls for men, long coats and caps for women ambulancedrivers and wardens, as well as overalls for women at first-aid posts and report centres.    Some 11,000 garments have been supplied and it isanticipated that a regular monthly issue of 80,000 garments will be&quot;aintained.
