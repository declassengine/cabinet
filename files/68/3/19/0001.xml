(this DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOvHRNMHNT) .V/.P.   (R)  (39)  10^Copy No.IXTH FORTNIGHTLY REPORT submitted by the Secretary of previous Report -- Paper W..P.(R) (39) 86)I.    GENERAL.The country generally remains quiet.   The firstenthusiasms provoked by the declaration of war show signsof waning owing to lack of material to sustain interest.The Sawbwa of Tawngpeng, a Shan State which isunusually wealthy as the Burma Corporation\ s lead and silver mine is situated in it, has contributed  10,000Irom State funds to the Red Cross War Relief Fund.   TheSawbwa returned recently from a visit to this country andfelt personally the loss of H.M.S. &quot;Courageous&quot; which hehad visited shortly before war was declared.   He has alsotaken steps to stimulate recruiting to the Burma forces by promising life exemption from certain taxes to anyvolunteers from Tawngpeng State.r_Cil.ltH.cal.The principal political event during the period hasbeen concerned with the answer to the premier1s enquiry onbehalf of the Ministers whether the statement made by theGovernor on November 7th connoted the attainment by Burmaof &quot;Dominion status&quot;.    The Governor&apos;s statement on November24th (approved by the Cabinet - W.P.(G) (39) 109) that30th November

1 &quot;M&quot;the natural issue of Burma.1 s constitutional progressthrough the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in Burma, is the attainment ofDominion status&quot; has not yet been commented upon by ministers either in public or in private discussion withthe Governor.press comment, however, is mainly on the line thatthis fresh statement merely repeats what was alreadyknown to everyone in Burma and is unsatisfactory in thatit makes no promise of any definite date for further constitutional advance from the present position.Press.Apart from such comment on the Governor &apos;s statement,the tone of the press has been not unsatisfactory with the single exception noted below.    Some Burmese papers see thepossibility of Italy being involved in war againstGermany and look forward to the destruction of Nazism;Germany1s mine warfare is strongly criticised but theopinion is expressed that international complications will result from seizure of German exports.   The view is also expressed that American interference would result fromviolation of Holland&apos;s neutrality by Germany with a viewto launching air attack on this country.    The materialsupplied from the Ministry of Information in support ofthe British cause continues to have satisfactory reception.The only item of enemy propaganda is the reproduct-ion by &quot;New Burma&quot; of an article in the &quot;Singaporeherald&quot;, a Japanese paper which is supplied free to the burmese press, justifying Germany&apos;s invasion of Poland,extolling Germany&apos;s invincibility and attributing

responsibility for the war to Great Britain.   Steps navebeen taken to prevent the entry into Burma of furtherissues of the &quot;Singapore Herald&quot;,II-    ShtiEiiCE.Nothing to report.III. EXTERNAL. RELATIONS.Nothing to report.IY.    ECONOMIC.(a) Internal:.   Nothing to report.(b) External.   The Minister of Commerce and FoodController of the Ceylon Government have arrived in burma to discuss the question of Ceylon&apos;s requirements of ricefrom Burma.    The 1940 rice crop originally promised to bea bumper crop, almost equal to that of 1939, but, as aresult of the recent severe floods, it is expected thatthe exportable surplus will be reduced by some 250,000tons, leaving an exportable amount of rather over ,000,000 tons.    With the loss of the Central european market owing to the war, this is likely fully to meet therequirements of outside purchasers.hrnond Terrace, Z&apos;S.W. 1.1st December 1939.
