(TWIS DOCUMENT IS the Pit OP :5Fdl&apos;Y DP his R9IT1NNT fj hMJHciTY&apos;3COVEHIIMPNT^ :-,V.P.(R)  (39) 118,v^p..ji^shp:tSeventh Fortnightly heport submitted by the Secretaryof State for India covering the period 1st to 15thBe ceil;be r, 1939 .(previous Report: v..p.(a) (399 103)i!   i; .   . :.; T     - r&apos; pivotal,T&apos;L) &apos;:;T &apos;     IP-. &apos; &apos;  &apos;   . .The past fortnight has produced no mitigation of the deadlock with the Indian National Congress.   On thecontrary, since a contributory cause of the deadlock islack of agreement between Hindus, or at all events that large section of Hindu opinion which adheres to theCongress, and Moslems, as represented by tne All-IndiaMoslem League, the events of the last few days have tended to harden the situation.On 5th December Mr. Gandni sent a message to the&quot;News Chronicle&quot; which was, of course, published oimultan-eously in India, in which he stated that &quot;Britain&apos;intentions about India should not be dependent upon Moslem,Hindu or any other opinion - not even Congress opinion.The only factor that counts is India&apos;s opinion and this can be ascertained only by a free vote of her people&quot;; andhe proceeded. - &quot;Moslem and other accepted minorities may berepresented /on the contemplated Constituent Assembly/ by aseparate electorate if necessary in the exact proportion oftheir numbers.    They will determine what is required fortheir protection.    In all matters of Common interest acomposite majority decision should prevail.&quot;   Mr. Gandhilopy Mo

9 o 31* G *had enlarged on the same lines on the theme of a constituent Assembly in an article published on 25thNovember in his own periodical &quot;Harijan&quot;.On 6th December Mr. Jinnah, President of the All-Tndia Moslem League,  issued a manifesto calling upon all local branches of the Moslem League throughout India tocelebrate the 22nd December as &quot;a day of deliverance andthanksgiving as a mark of relief that the CongressGovernments have at last ceased to function&quot;.   He appended to his manifesto the text of a long Resolution which all local branches of the League were recommended formally toadopt.    The last paragraph of this he solution urged the governors of the Provinces &quot;to inquire into the legitimate grievances of Moslems and the wrong that was done to them by the outgoing Congress Ministries and to redress the same at the earliest moment...and thus to assure the people that the new regime stands for evenjustice to all communities and interests concerned&quot;.    Thisallegation of biased and unfair treatment of the Moslemsby the Congress Governments is one which representativesof the Moslem community have been ventilating for some time,and in some Provinces peripatetic committees have been organised in order to collect evidence in support of it.A parallel allegation has been that the Governors have failed to exercise as they should have done their special powers for the protection of minorities with a view tocounteracting anti-Mo siem action.On 9th December Mr. Jinnah followed up his manifestoby a lengthy statement broadcast to the Indian Press on the text of Mir. Gandhi&apos;s recent observations referred to aboveon his ideas of a Constituent Assembly.    The general driftof this pronouncement which was cast in most uncompromising

9 O *-   O   - (-0 &apos;ilanguage was that the Congress scheme for a ConstituentAssembly was merely a means of imposing a Hindu raj on the minorities in general and tne Moslems in particular, andwas carefully designed to prevent the latter from makingth e ir w i she s felt..0n the same date, 9th December, Mr. Gandhi issued anappeal to Mr. Jinnah to defer action for the celebration on22nd December at all events till the Governors and theGovernor-General had pronounced upon the truth of the moslem allegations against the Congress Governments; and about the same time Sardar Vallabhai Patel, one of theleading members of the Congress Working Committee, andMr. C. Rajagopalachariar, the late premier of Madras,issued statements flatly denying the truth of theseallegations.On hearing of Mr;. Gandhi&apos;s appeal to Mr. Jinnah of 9thDecember I thought it as well to draw the Viceroy&apos;attention to the embarrassments which might result from anysituation which forced the Governors or himself into anarbitral position in relation to this aspect of communaldissensions.    Inquiries which the Governor-General had madeprivately of certain Governors some six months ago hadshorn that, while it would probably be difficult if not impossible to produce concrete evidence in support of the moslem allegations, there was no doubt that Moslems in the&quot;Congress&quot; provinces were being made to feel their positionas a minority rather by the general attitude of unofficialsupporters of Congress than as the result of any overtaction by the Congress Government itself.    Consequently any formal finding by the Governors or tne Governor-General&quot;that the complaints were baseless and unjustified would almost certainly greatly exacerbate Moslem feeling.    In

reply the Goyernor-G-eneral ha3 assured me that he is fullyconscious of the delicacy of the problem and is giving ithis earnest consideration.   my latest information is thatIvir. Jinnah is now publicly demanding a Koyal Commission toexamine and pronounce upon his community&apos;s assertions.II.    MIuIIjJcY AFFAIRS.The four Animal Transport Companies referred to inthe last report sailed on 10th December.620 pack mules for France are expected to sail fromBombay on 17th December.   A conducting party of 140 Indianranks will hand over the mules to British and Cypriotpersonnel at Fort Said and will then return to India.Apart from the above there is no change in thesituation as regards the Army or Royal Air Force in India.III. FOREIGN ;.r?D InvONTIER /Ah^modifications.Afghan istan.The Russian attack on Finland is reported to naverenewed anxiety in Afghanistan as to the future intentions of the Soviet Government.

refugees,   This was received calmly by the Afridi Jirgavno were reported to be genuinely relieved that theblockade which had been imposed on them was over and to be unlikely to cause further trouble for some time to come.Sinkiajr-..The Consul-General at Kashgar has received a furtherdemand for the surrender of his wireless apparatus from theFa sugar Commissioner, who has threatened to take drasticand effective steps if his demands are not met withoutfurther delay.   The Consul-General fears that he may be forced to close the station.   His Majesty1s Ambassador atChungking has been instructed to make a personal appeal toChiang Kal Shek in the matter.The Consul-General has reported abnormal movementsgenerally at night of lorries loaded with troops and supplies between Artush, Kashgar and Aksu.    It is possiblethat these movements may be connected with plans for amore drastic Sovietieation of the province.Tibet.The following message has been sent to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Government of India from the Regent and ministers of Tibet:&quot;Some time ago we heard that war had brokenout in Europe and we were hoping that it might cometo an end before now.    Tibet is a religious country.We have therefore arranged for the performance of religious services and offering of prayers for the speedy termination of the war and that peace andhappiness may be restored to all mankind.&quot;A suitable acknowledgment of the message and the goodwill&quot;ditch it signifies has been sent.

There have also been reports of the growth incertain States, notably Cwalior, of anti-war propagandaemanating from British India.The training of units of Indian States Forces whichhave been embodied with the British Forces continues andthe Maharajas of Kashmir and JOclhpur, the former anHonorary Major-General and the latter an Honorary Air-Commodore and Colonel in the r.rrny, are reported to haveshown much personal interest in the training of their men.There have so far been no adverse economic effectsfrom the war in the States.   Most branches of industrial activity,  in particular cotton mills, have received a stimulus.
