A.      HOME(1)    PUBLICITY CAMPAIGNS( a) Arxti-GossipIn addition to the warning notices exhibited intelephone kiosks, railway carriages, public places etc.,which were referred to in the last report, the Ministryhas in hand the preparation of posters suitable for publichouses, docks,  and works, and a Pougasse series forexhibition in hotels and restaurants.(b) Rationing.The present policy is to concentrate on informing the public how to use ration cards;    but a scheme has been worked out providing for broadcasting, provision of materiato the press etc., which will be put into operation whenrationing has been actually introduced.(c) Evacuation.The publicity campaign on the subject of evacuation which I was asked to undertake is now proceedingA comprehensive scheme has been decided upon afterconsultation with the Ministry of Health and the Board ofEducation.    This scheme includes Press activities;    letters from local mayors to parents of evacuated children;    aletter to voluntary societies;    and posters, films and b.B.C. talks.( d) Civil DefenceAn article describing the Air Raid Warning system will shortly appear in the first number of a weekly state-ment called &quot;Information&quot; which is being instituted for circulation to all voluntary societies.An article entitled &quot;Britain&apos;s Army of EireFighters&quot; will be made available to Works Magazines(aggregate readership 2,000,000).(e) Other MattersPreparations are in hand for schemes to combatwaste,  and to counter defeatist propaganda,    A booklet,&quot;Fifty Pacts for Hitler&apos;s British Dupes&quot;,  in which theMinistry is interested,  is being largely bought by thepublic,(2 )    BROADCASTINGProm the propaganda standpoint programmes showan improvement in interest, variety and planning.    Theyhave included the first two of a series of six programmes&quot;The Shadow of the Swastika&quot;, various items from the B.E.P,entertainments in Prance, and talks by Dominion ministers and Monsieur Reynaud,

B.        OVERSEASOfficial publications, pamphlets, featurearticles and photographs continue to he sent to theEmpire and Missions abroad.    Some examples of the scaleon which distribution is now being made may be ofinterest.    Thus,  12000 copies in English of the white paper &quot;Germany No.2&quot; have been sent out;    it has alsobeen commercially circulated in French, Danish and swedish and is now going out in German, Italian and spanish.    Reprints of speeches by the Prime Minister,Lord Halifax, Mr.Churchill, and MroHore-Belisha have gone in large quantities to all parts of the world.Many thousand copies of the &quot;Hitler Calendar&quot; published by &quot;The Times&quot;&apos; have been distributed eg.  2,000 to Adenfor passing ships, and it has been translated intoFrench, Dutch, Spanish, Danish, etc;    The Blue Bookcontinues to be published in additional languages and issold in large quantities,,    Some twenty-five thousand ofthe &quot;Oxford Pamphlets&quot; have boon sent all over the world,including Russia, Italy and the Far East and some of them have been translated into ten languages.    Some L5 articles in 2,000 copies are supplied weekly to 505 foreign news-papers.    During November 21*000 photographs were sent abroad as well as large numbers of stereos.THE B.B.C.  on the 12th November instituted a revised programme&apos;&quot;schedule.    Under this system the newsin languages other than English is no longer directed toall parts of the world, but only to specific areas wherethe bulletins in question are known to have an audience.The change has made it possible to provide the Englishspeaking audience with a greater proportion of generalentertainment,    A news service in Turkish began on the20th November,  and a news service of early morningbulletins in German, Czech, English, Italian and Polishhas been introduced.    Comments received indicate thatreception has been generally good.    South Africa seemsto be an exception, but the evidence is not entirelyconclusive.IN FRANCE the objectives of our propaganda havebeen to combat the feeling that England is not pullingher weight in the War and the fear tha1: when the time comes to make peace England will let France down byignoring the French view.,    The French official informationorganisation, with which the closest contact das beenestablished by this Ministry,  are fully alive to the dangers which would ensue if German propaganda succeeded in driving a wedge between the two countries.    The french press continually publish articles and photographs showingthe extent of the British war activity os0    One day&apos;spublications analysed show twenty pictures in sevenpapers and eleven articles in nine papers on Britishsubjects.    It is, however,  important to increase thissupply of material;    and in general the more material of this kind, especially phonographs and films, that theService Departments are willing to release, the more successful will be our efforts to convince the French ofthe magnitude and seriousness of oar war effort.

Owing to the strict control exorcised by theGovernment, British propaganda in SPAIN is faced with many difficulties.    There is reason to&quot; believe, however,that the B.B.C. Bulletins have a considerable audienceand that their objectivity is welcomed.    The Press whichpreviously had maintained an almost consistently hostileattitude has shown a considerable improvement in the last ten days.    All reports indicate that the general body ofthe people is more friendly than one would judge from thePress.    I regard the supply of Publicity films to Spainas very important, but although negotiations are being actively pursued, we have not yet succeeded in concludingthem.IN PORTUGAL the situation is completelyfavourable.    The BoBDCc news which is relayed by thePortuguese National Broadcasting Station is one of themost popular items of the whole Portuguese programme.,and the press is entirely friendly in character,,IN ITALY opinion is moving slowly,  and withoccasional setbacks,  in a direction favourable to us,Wc have had some success in placing photographs in thePress.    The strength of the B.B.C. transmissions toItaly has increased.    These arc on both short and mediumwavelengths, with one exception which is on short-waveonly.    There is evidence of a good deal of listening-in;and Turin reports that reception of short-wave is fairlygood, deteriorating in the late evening, but that of medium-wave, poor.    Regular talks in Italian are being arranged.The SCANDINAVIAN and BALTIC STATES have beenoverv/hclmingly preoccupied with&quot;&apos;the &quot;fear of Russia, anddepressed also by the indiscriminate mining of ships byGermany and the British reprisals against Gorman exports,These conditions render British propaganda difficult, butin some directions there is progress.    The breakdown incommunications with Scandinavia has been largely remedied;though there are still delays in the mails and the telephone service is unsatisfactory.    In SWEDEN the workof the Press Attache has been particularly effective:    a pro-German paper, the &quot;Aftchbladet&quot; warned its readersthat British propaganda was &quot;astute, well-thought out,moderate and entirely suited to our mentality&quot;,    Norwegianpublic opinion remains favourable to us.    Denmark, owingto geographical proximity and military weakness is verysusceptible to German pressure, though we are able tostate our side of the story through the Danish corrcspon-dents here.Nothing can be done to influence opinion inRUSSIA except by supplying HoM.Embassy with material tocommunicate to colleagues of the Diplomatic Corps and to soviet officials.In the smaller neutral countries of Europe itmay broadly speaking be said that the limiting factor tothe success of our propaganda is fear of Germany, whichputs continual pressure on the smaller neighbouring countries, and on those economically dependent on her.    In

- h -all these countries we have considerable success in getting British news and photographs into the localpress.    Thus, each week a large budget of pages ofBritish material is published in Holland and Belgium.On the other hand, soVTS harm was done by sensationalarticles in the British press on the threatened german attack on these countries.The position in the MIDDLE EAST shows a steadyimprovement.    German propaganda in spite of its carefulorganisation and unlimited funds has had little effectowing to the personal unpopularity of Hitler and the realisation of the menace to Arab aspirations which a victory for Nazi-ism would represent.In the PAN EAST the British Library ofInformation is doing good work and the daily bulletinis becoming popular.    There is, however, in JAPAN and inSIAM a great suspicion of and hostility to, openpropaganda.    The Japanese Government in particular are determined to prevent anything like an Anglo-german propaganda war on their soil and however effective maybe the presentation of the British case it remains truethat fundamentally Japanese sympathies are with Germanyrather than with Britain.    In CHINA British activities are inevitably circumscribed owing to the japanese occupation.The reports received indicate that the materialsupplied to INDIA AND THE COLONIES has been suitable andhas obtained wide and ready publicity.   Public opinion inthe Colonies is generally satisfactory though both here and in the DOMINIONS there is still a certain lack of appreciation of the magnitude and determination of our war effort and a failure to realise the need for economicself-sacrifice.    German propaganda does not appear to behaving any material effect on public opinion, and inSOUTH AFRICA in particular, though unremitting, it appearsto be defeating itself by its own excesses.    german propaganda throughout the world makes strong attacks on british Imperialism in India and elsewhere.All the evidence available, from the Embassy,the British Library of Information, the American Press,and objective observers in the UNITED STATES has, up tothe present time,  justified our policy of abstention frompropaganda.This was certainly true during the period of the neutrality debate in Congress;    and the result in the shape of the now Act is so favourable to the Allied causethat, for the present, there is no reason to depart from our main line of publicity policy in the United States.Our prudence has earned its first reward.During the first six weeks of the War theservice of German nev/s and pictures in the American pressfar exceeded our own.   This balance has to some extent beenredressed;   but it is noticeable that American interest inthe War as a whole has declined in recent weeks, and theAmerican public has been more concerned with its owndomestic affairs than with the European situation.
