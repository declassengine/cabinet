(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0.7 HIS BRI TAHITI C MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT)S E C RETANALYSIS    OP    GERMAN    PROPAGANDANovember 1st to lhth 1939(With, a general review of&quot; the interim period - October 16th to 31st.)Made   bytheDEPARTMENT FOR PUBLICITY IN ENEMY COUNTRIES

It is intended to produce a &quot;bi-monthlyanalysis of German propaganda.      This reportdeals wiJ&quot;.h the period November 1st to 1 hth.    an appendix is attached covering the period October16th to 31st.In the first part of this analysis an attempt is made to divide German propaganda, by wireless,press and cable,  into a number of lines which maybe regarded as sufficiently stable to provide abasis for comparison-      A brief description isgiven of each of these lines, with some indication;of their relative importance In the propagandadirected to (1)  the German home population;(11)  Great Britain;   (111 ) France,  and(iv) neutral countries.Secondly,  a table is given in which therelative importance of eaph of these lines isgiven in percentages of the total propagandadirected to each of the four regions.      It willbe seen from this table that certain lines pre-dominate over others.      These are,  in order ofimportance:    &quot;German strength&quot;,    &quot;British brutality&apos;&quot;British weakness&quot;,   &quot;Britain lies&quot;,   &quot;France isfighting for British interests&quot;,   &quot;Britain theenemy of neutrals&quot; and &quot;Dissensions in the BritishEmpire&quot;.      The anti-British lines are given far more prominence than the anti-French.Thirdly,  since the Munich Bomb Attempt of

German The predominating line of German propagandastrength-was an insistence upon the strength of Germany.    Thiswas given special prominence in the broadcasts toGermany,,  and even greater space in the German Press.It also formed a considerable part uf the broad-casts to enemy countries and to neutrals.The main items dealt with are:  German accessof strength through her new conquests;  the supportof Russia,  and a partial reporting of P;olotov&apos;sspeech (this is especially stressed in the presscomments);  the ineffectiveness of the Britishblockade and the  triumph of the counter-blockade.A brief attempt was made to show that the Rome-Berlin Axis is net quite dead, but this was entirelyNovember 8 th deeply influenced the whole courseof German propaganda during the second half of thisperiod,  this event is dealt with separately and at greater length in Appendix I.    Other events whichcolour this period are (1) the speeches of M.Mbloiov on Cotcher 31st and November ?th,  (11) thesupposed threat to Holland and Belgium,  and (111)the offer of mediation by the Dutch and BelgianSovereigns on November 7th,Fourthly,  as the  last report furnished by theMin? stry of Information did not carry the surveybeyond October 15th,   the  interim period of October16th to 31st is treated in a general review attachedto this report as Appendix II.,

subordinated to Berlin-Moscow.. Russian supportaccounts for fully one-third of the items illus-trating German strength.great Britain This item is almost equally directed to the&quot;the enemy of neutrals and for home consumption.      It is mainlyNeutrals.ooncerned with the effect of the British blockadeupon neutral trade.      Minor iiterns are: that great britain is now trying,  and has always tried,  to force neutrals to make war on Germany,  and theviolation of neutral territory by British aeroplanesGermany the Subsidiary to this item is the contention,friend neutrals.      featured in the German press and,  to a small extent,in German home broadcasts,  that Germany is a pro-tector of neutral countries and that these ne utralssupport Germany.      It is significant that this lineis not used in broadcasts to the neutrals themselvesBritain&apos;s This line forms an important part of broadcastswea^ness.to Great Britain and to neutrals and is featured toa less extent in the broadcasts to Prance and thehome service.    It may be divided into twoheadings:-    (a) Internal and economic weaknessesof Great Britain;- rising prices;fall in trade;  unemployment;organisational muddle;  low morale of the British population; risingtide of opposition against the continuation of the war.(b)    Defence weaknesses  :- the successof the German counter-blockade;  theBritish loss of control of the north sea;  the vulnerability of theBritish Fleet,  and the withdrawal ofthe British troops from China.

Dissensions in This Item is mainly used in broadcasts to thethe Britishjj^npire. neutrals and  for home consumption.      The majoritems are:-    the opposition of !&apos;the large majorityof South Africans1&apos; to participation in the war,  andthe growing opposition in India to British rule:Of lesser importance are British difficulties inthe Near East,  Palestine,  Irak,  and Egypt;   trouble-in Ireland,  and the lack of enthusiasm of theDominions for support of Britain.This item received great impetus after theMunich bomb explosion.      It  is a favourite pointin broadcasts to Germany,   to neo.tra.ls,   and toGreat Britain herself.      It  is for some reason not used, so much in the broadcasts to Prance.      before november 8th the specific items in the charge werethe Colonial methods of Great Britain in palestine and India,  and her conduct of the Boer .Var -      Aspecial feature was the sufferings of the    GermanConsul and his staff in Glasgow after theoutbreak of war.      After the Munich explosion afull-dress offensive was launched against the&quot;historic methods of the British Secret Service&apos;&apos;.(This point, which upset the balance of the mainlines ox&apos; propaganda,  is described in greater detail in Appendix I,)This charge is directed in the first place toBritish listeners,  secondly,  to home listeners andto the neutrals,  and only to a lesser extent to france ,,      The theme is that British propaganda lieson principle,  and it may be taken as an attempt toBritishbrutalityand unscru-pulousness.SEitadnLies

destroy belief in the veracity of the B.B.C., theBritish Press- and British sources of information,in general.      The main line of attach during thisperiod has been the &quot;British lie&quot; that germany was preparing to attach Belgium and Holland.Any detail of news sent out from Great britain on which any doubt can be cast is seized upon andmagnified.       It was announced a few days agothat an official of the Propaganda Ministry hadalready collected some 160 examples of &quot;Britishlies&quot; since the beginning of the war.British In their broadcasts for home consumption and:War Guiltto neutral countries the general charge is ruatlethat Great Britain has been plotting war againstGermany for years and that the invasion ofPoland was only an excuse for a long-preparedoffensive.      Considerable play is made with aletter from M,  Osuslcy alleged to have been foundin the Prague archives.      It is also stated that russia believes in British war guilt.      In the propaganda directed to Great Britain a distinctionis made between the British people, who areinnocent, and a small clique of profiteers,capitalists and warmongers, who are reallyresponsible for the war,      The question is &quot;barelyraised in broadcasts to France.German &quot;true An extremely interesting item of propagandaSocialismX-British       which as yet is directed almost entirely to&quot;rottenCapitalism&quot;Great Britain is the theme that German ITational-Socialisra is the &quot;true Socialism&quot; at wan;1 with the

&quot;rotten Capitalism&quot; oi Great Britain.      This joinsup vrith the previous theme of the &quot;war guilt&quot; ofthe British Capitalist.      A picture is given ofthe free and. happy life of the German workingclasses ,  contrasted with the misery and unemploy-ment of the oppressed British proletariat.      It is obviously an attempt to canalise social discontent.personal These, which are given less importance thanAttacks on-British       heretofore s arc mainly confined to broadcasts toLeaders.Great Britain.      The main attack against Mr.Chamberlain and. Mr.  Churchill has died down, andthe offensive is directed, against Lord Halifaxon account of his speech of November 2nd.france This is the favourite line of argument usedfightingonly for     for French consumption.      It is also, curiouslyBritishinterests.  enough,  employed, in broadcasts to Great Britain. .The main items are:-    the British troops are notin the Front Line;    they lead, a luxurious life inthe safety of the Hinterland.,   (&quot;They only carewhere they sleep, and. with whom&quot;).      It is stressed that France has no interests at stake, that she would, be forced to make severe sacrifices in thewar and that Britain will certainly stab her in the back as soon as it suits her convenience.      As an interesting and. somewhat inconsistent sideline,it is stated that Germany does not believe that thereis any cleavage &quot;between the French and. the Britishpeoples, Puts rather, that the Governments of thesecountries are misleading them.

fflany. Allied to the ahove theme is the companionoffersfriendship Germany offers her friendship to Prance. this to Prance.&apos; is intended solely for Prench consumption.Quotations from Hitler are given to show thatGermany demands nothing from Prance.      It isof interest to note that this theme has appa-rently died down since the Munich bomb attempt.French This line is given far less space than the weakness.companion theme of &quot;British weakness&quot;.      It is,however, given a certain prominence in broad-casts to Prance.      Prance&apos;s economic and politl-cal difficulties are pointed out, together with her alleged lack of warlike spirit and the growing defeatism of her population.French A minor line used for home consumption andBrutality.for the neutrals is Prench brutality.      Thishas only recently come into prominence, but may be expected to develop in the future,      go far the main items are:-    (i) the behaviour ofthe Prench during the occupation of the Rhine-land, and (ii)    the unscrupulous attitude of theFrench Press and. wireless towards the Munichbomb attempt.^SS e This companion piece to &quot;Britain Lios::  isLies.of minor importance except in broadcasts toFrance.      Like Its British counterpart,  it is anattempt to destroy &quot;belief in Prench sources ofinformation.      In order, however, to maintain thetheme that Britain is the major culprit it is

pointed out that the French Press and radiodoes not represent true French opinion, &quot;outhas teen bribed by British warmongersAllied War This theme is mainly used in propaganda&quot; Aims.to Great Britain and; to a loss extent    toFrance and to the neutrals.      It is statedthat the Allies have no war aims \ or, if suchaims exist, that they arc afraid to state them,as they are bent on the utter destruction ofGermany.Anti-Semitism. This theme is mainly used for internalconsumption.      It is pointed out that Britishand French Press and radio are under Jewishcontrol.      It has also been stated, that anti-Jewish riots have broken out in various partsof Britain.The above 17 items may be regarded as the major lines of German propaganda which willprobably continue from week to week..      Thefollowing individual items are also of interest(a)      Talks to Great Britain and to neutral countries pointing out the hypocrisy ofthe British assertion that she Is fightingGerman irreligion.      It is stated thatreligion is very much alive in Germany.The curious point is made  chat british members of the Internalional Brigadefought on the side of atheists in Spain,

(b)      Comments on the United StatesNeutrality Act.The following points are mafo in the broadcasts to various audiences P--(i) to Germany:    Repeal will injurethe United States.      It will do the Alliesno good and is inconsistent with trueneutrality.(ii) to.Great Britain and France:Repeal will not be of much use to theAllies.(iii)to European neutrals:    Repealis not true neutrality.      It is a danger to the interests of the entire american continent and is due to warmongering by president Roosevelt.(iv) to America1:    America is warnedto keep out of Europe.      Intervention didher1 no good last time and she cannot expect better luck this time.Certain lines of propaganda which areprominent in the German Press have been disre-garded in this Analysis.      They consist ofgeneral :,Pep. Talks&quot; , dissertations onthe value of German culture and on the victorious record of German action, in Poland.\\

APPENDIX    I,THE    MUNICH    BOMB    EXPLOSION.1.        Effect on tie general balance of propaganda.The reaction to the outrage was a great increase in the denunciations of Britishbrutality and unscrupulousness,  to which other items were ruthlessly sacrificed.      At thesame time,  the propaganda directed towardsPrance became increasingly hostile and lessinterested in Prance&apos;s welfare.    It is curiousto note that in the propaganda directed toGreat Britain exposure of British weaknessincreases almost equally with denunciation ofBritish brutality.      The coincidence of thepeace proposals of the Dutch and Belgian Sove-reigns caused a parallel increase in denunciation-ciation of Allied war aims.2.        Treatment of the Explosion.The Munich bomb explosion took place onthe evening of November 8th.      The immediatereaction of the German Propaganda Ministry wasto ascribe the attack to foreign instigation.&quot;The country of the Secret Service, Britain,may be assured that this time we are going totake drastic measures against the enemies ofthe State.&quot;      The German Press took up thesame tune.     In the words of the LOKAL ANZEIGER:&quot;Did the British Secret Service want torealise Mr.  Chamberlain&apos;s aim, the annihilationof Hitlerism, by bloody methods and by murder?1

The general tone of comments was that theEnglish had given the Germans a practicallesson on how they were going to conduct thewar, and that the German people would neverforget the lesson.      &quot;We know now that we mustenforce peace against hatred, murder andcowardice.      Having failed to destroy Germany by military means, by economic means and by sub-versive propaganda, they have fallen back on thetime-honoured British method of assassination,&quot;The argument was developed on succeedingdays that Mr. Chamberlain and other Britishstatesmen had, by expressing their hope thatHitlerism would be destroyed, dire-ctly instilgated the outrage.      A &quot;charge Sheet&quot; was published by the German Press, lis-ting a numberof such statements and o-ancluding: -    &quot;Well, Mr.Chamberlain, after hearing our charge of insti-gation to murder against you and your Government^are you still prepared, to plead &apos;not guilty&apos;of complicity before the act of the Munichoutrage?&quot;Amongst other evidence, the German propa-gandists produced the following facts tosupport the charge:-     (l)    the B.B.C., somehours before the outrage, had announced that britain had a mysterious weapon with which to strike Germany;    (2)    the reports of the eventhad reached London in a suspiciously short time after the explosion.      This was treated as a repetition of what had happened after the murder of M, Calinescu, which was also arranged by the

British Secret Service;    (3)    Reuter had saidthat this v/as the first bomb aimed at theGerman Dictator,  and that many more would follow.It was not, however,  stated that Reuter wasquoting this from the German Freedom Stationbroadcast;    (h)    the British radio, in commenting on the German investigations, had said:    &quot;Theywill have no success&quot;,  and the Prench stationhad said:    &quot;This will not be the last bomb toexplode.&quot;In order to substantiate the accusationagainst the British Secret Service,  a long listof past murders was given in various wirelessbroadcasts.      These included:    M. Galinescu;Kings Ghazi and Peisal of Iraq;    Paul I  andNicolas II of Russia;    King Carol I of Roumania;the Archduke Franz Ferdinand;    King Alexander of yugoslavia and M. Barthou;    vom Rath;    JeanJaures;    and TtE. Lawrence.The Secret Service is described as&quot;a world-encompassing espionage organisation,endowed with huge funds and operating everywhereto serve British interests in peace and war.In 1938 it received  500,000,  in addition to itsnormal budget.      Money v/ill always find willinghelpers.      The ultimate action is left to naLivesbribed in various countries.      These poorunwitting helpers of British diplomacy act mostlyunder the delusions of their own more or lessclouded minds.      Anarchists,  dissatisfied ordisgruntled individuals,  are used as tools.They receive instructions from sources unknown to

them and through mysterious individuals.Nobody knows who is at the head of the secret service, nobody knows either the agents, orthe intermediaries.     When some momentous act,such as a political murder, occurs, theactual responsible wirepullers remain outsidethe scope of evidence.     With all its manifoldactivities the British Secret Service has inmost oases managed to keep secret.     We knowSnly of the existence of its crimes.&quot;,     Gauleiter Wagner, in his speech at thefuneral of one of the victims on November 16th,,asked whether Britain heard the voice of thisNational-Socialist, who was the victim ofthis horrible British crime.      &quot;We do notthink so,&quot; the wireless commentator added.&quot;Britain has never paid attention to thevoices of her victims in past history, but weGermans heard the last words of Michael Schmeidland we will never forget them.&quot;

APPENDIX    II.GENERAL SURVEY    OF    GERMAN    PROPAGANDAfrom October 16th. to 51st, 1959.The fortnight of German propaganda, October16th to 31st, sees the transfer of interest fromthe East of Europe to the West.      The story thatGreat Britain supplied Poland with mustard gas isintended to liaise animosity against the Allies,and the sinking of the &quot;Royal Oak&quot; occurred justin time go give Hitler a success in the West.The poison gas story, the sinking of the &quot;RoyalOak&quot;, the &quot;Ark Royal&quot; story, and the damaging ofthe  &quot;Repulse&quot; and the &quot;Hood&quot; are run hard through-out the fortnight.      Oddly enough, more attention is paid to the three latter ships than to the&quot;Courageous&quot; , which was genuinely sunk.A constant theme of propaganda in itself isthe Ministry of Information, which is in turnridiculed for being ineffective and abused forits  &quot;sinister lies&quot;&apos;.      Every advantage is taken ofPar 1 ianientary critical i c i srn.The &quot;Athenia&quot; story - that Mr.  Churchill gaveorders to sink, her in order to bring America intothe war - reaches a new peal&apos;: in the third week ofOctober with the Goebbels speech, which amounts toem official accusation.      The accusation, togetherwith much abuse against Mr.  Churchill, continues tothe end of the month, when the story more or losspeters out - apart from occasional references.Prom October 20th, the Western Front is ratherunwillingly developed as a propaganda theme ofdubious value.      Thei&apos;e are short, soldierly

A ft A1 ulecoounts of successful actions,  and the reiter-ated assertion that no British troops are tohe found on the whole Front.By. the end of the month of October, german public interest is completely reconcentratedon the Western Front,  and only the briefestallusions are made to Poland and the baltic states.      A veil is held over submarine warfare,German air losses are divided by five, and noobituaries of infantrymen on the Western Frontare allowed to appear.      By such methods a fairly good appearance of success is maintained on the surface.In the Press of October 22nd a German warcommunique describes at length the evacuation of the territory captured from the French, andits easy occupation by German troops.The emphasis on &quot;Ritterlichkeit&quot;, or chivalry,in U-boat warfare and on the Western Frontbegins to wear out towards the end of October,and there is an evident intensifying of propa-ganda against Great Britain,  although forpreference the Government only is attacked.To tales of unrest inside Germany,  the german press replies with reports of opposition to theImperialist British Government in South africa and India.      The month ends with a strong fillipto German-Pussi an relations, given by theSoviet Note to Great Britain on British blockademeasures.      This is exploited to the full inGermany, as is the arrival of the Soviet trade delegation.      There is absolute reserve, however,

on- tiie inner structure of Russia, its ideologyand world aims.      The tendency,  not yet com--pletely mature,  is to present to Germans andforeigners the picture of a National-SocialistGermany, prepared for a long war againstCapitalist England.The German propaganda to neutral countries is abusive of the Allies and emphatic on theeconomic strength of Germany.      There is complete aloofness in the German Press  concerningpolitical affairs in South-Enstorn Europe,  apartfrom Slovakia.      German propaganda pave- greatattention to Slovakia,  and does everything to stress the good relations between the Protec-torate and the Reich.      This amiability isshown to no other of Germany&apos;s smaller neighbours.
