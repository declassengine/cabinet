MINISTRY OP ECONOMIC WARFARE.Report of Action Taken for Week Ending December 3rd.1. War Trade Agreements and Relatiobs with Neutral Countries.The decision to take action against enemy exportshas continued to be the main subject of interestaffecting relations with neutral countries.      the strongest protests have come from the Netherland and japanese Governments.      In a statement issued in tokyo the Japanese Government made a disingenuous attemptto twist a statement, made by the Ministry on the 22ndSeptember,  to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere not taking action against German exports, into a promise that in no circumstances would they seize german exports to Japan.      H.M. Representatives abroad have &quot;been authorised to reassure the Governments to which they are accredited that it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to bring the provisions of the Reprisals Order-in-Council into force gradually and with leniency, andwith as much consideration for neutral susceptibilitiesas is compatible with the attainment of their objective.This assurance has had a good effect in countries such asIran where the decision to seize enemy exports came as aconsiderable shock2.    It is now hoped to sign the Swedish War trade agreement at the end of the present week.      Signature ofthe Belgian Agreements has not yet been possible.Unexpected progress has been made with the preliminary discussions with the Norwegian Government in Oslo and a norwegian Delegation is expected very shortly.      Thenegotiations/

negotiations with, the Danish Government are continuing.3.    The situation in the various countries is breifly as follows:SWEDEN.Is.    Progress has been made with the negotiationsduring the past week and a &quot;final&quot; text of the draftdocuments is now available,  subject to any last-minutechanges which may be found necessary.      There are stillvarious points outstanding which do not affect the text of the documents constituting the War Trade Agreementproper,  the chief of them being the Payments Agreementbetween the Bank of England and the Riksbank which isintended to transform the Swedish Kroner from a &quot;hard&quot;to an &quot;easy&quot;  currency.      If this can be settled at once it is helieved that the other outstanding   points can be cleared away in time for the Agreement to be signed onthe 7th or 8th December.NORWAY.5c    Lord Glenconner,  the Representative of theMinistry who has been in Oslo, has now returned toLondon.,      During the last few days of his stay LordGlenconner made great progress in his conversations with theNorwegian Representative, Mr.  Prebensen.      Withoutprejudice to either side; he has drawn up craft  .Heads ofAgreement and has discussed the treatment of mostNorwegian imports and exports.      The Norwegian Governmenthave proposed that their Delegation, headed by Mr.Prebensen,should come to London to negotiate..      This suggestion hasbeen accepted and the Delegation is expected at the end ofthis week,DENMARK6.

Agreement was reached on the main lines.      The Icelandic trade representatives,however,  said that in their opinion the Icelandic TrawlerFleet would be compelled to lay up owing to the unsatisfactoryprices obtainable for fresh fish and to the fact that it hadbeen found impossible to repeal the 10c/j duty in the UnitedKingdom on imported white fish.      They strongly urged thatthis decision might be reconsidered,  saying that the repeal of the duty would be greatly appreciated by the Governmentand the people of Iceland as a signal act of friendship.FINLAND8.    In view of the recent political developments andthe invasion of Finland by the U.S.S.R.  army,  special measures are be ng   taken by the Ministry of economic warfare,  in conjunction with the Swedish and Norwegian Governments,  to expedite the granting of export licences and the passing by the Contraband Committee of goodsdestined for Finland,BALTIC STATESLITHUANIA.9.

It has not yet been possible to sign the War trade agreements with the Belgian Government as it was found thatthere were still some discrepancies in the lists attachedto the Anglo-Belgian and Franco-Belgian Agreements.      Inurder to ensure that the two Agreements are as closely related as possible in all details, Mr. Villiers andMr. Morrison went to Paris at the end of the week to discussoutstanding points with the French authorities.lh.  The Netherlands Delegation having returned toThe Hague last   week there have been no further developments in the War Trade Agreement negotiations.SWITZERLAND.15.  The Swiss Delegation in Paris have returned toBerne to seek the instructions of their Government.SOVIET RUSSIA.16. The case of the Soviet ship &quot;Kazakhstan&quot;  (paragraph22 of last week&apos;s report) has provided the Soviet Governmentwith an opportunity to re-iterate their claim that allSoviet ships are State ships.      It is proposed   to make clear to the Soviet Government that His Majesty&apos;s government cannot recognize such a claim.PORTUGAL.17.  His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has been instructed toconsider the question of including in the draft agreement aprovision/

provision forbidding direct exports to Germany or ofrequesting a separate assurance that the portuguese government will assist our Contraband Control by preventingsuch exports as far as possible.18. A resume of the position regarding negotiationswith various other neutrals has been communicated, to the embassy for the information of the Portugese Government.SPAIN.19-  Reports have been received from the british delegation at Madrid on their discussions with Spanishofficials respecting payments, facilities for Anglo-Spanish trade and shipping.      To avoid the entire stoppage of trade between the    two countries pending the conclusionof a definite&apos;agreement, the British and Spanish Delegationshave signed an agreed minute dealing (l) with the employmentof the sterling proceeds  if bhe sale of Spanish goods imported into the United Kingdom.;,   (2) with facilities for the exchangeof commodities between the two countries,  and (3) with thequestion of shipping,  of which there is a serious shortage.20.  The matter vf the purchase of large quantitiesof oranges from Spain is still under consideration here.The abnormally high prices    demanded for this and forpractically every other commodity and the unnaturally highvalue of the peseta appear to he  the chief obstacles inthe way of the successful continuation of the negotiations.It seems clear that the devaluation of the peseta willbecome Imperative if an agreement is to be concluded.      the delegation maintain that we should not give way over prices.This,  they consider, might mean a breakdown, but a breakdownwould bring the Spaniards face to face with the realities of the true economic situation.21. Another question discussed by the Delegation hasbeen that of outstanding debts to this country.      the spaniards have asked for a loan to pay off these arrearsand/

and have teen informed, that it will he considered but thatit is most improbable that we can give them one.ITALY.22.

Italian ports arecongested with goods unloaded from ships which have given aguarantee to hold cargoes at the disposal of the ContrabandCommittee and which are still awaiting release by theCommittee.

The Ministerial Sub--Committee on economic warfare having considered the claims of Greece to continue assistance on political grounds,  instructions have been sent to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Athensto link this  question with the satisfaction bythe Greek Government of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsrequirements on some outstanding issues.      The mostimportant of these is an arrangement for the charter of Greek tonnage towards which no progress has been madeby negotiations with Greek shipovmers direct and to whichthe Greek Government have so far declined to contribute any assistance.      Further requirements are a settlement with united Kingdom holders of Greek bonds and the conclusionof a definitive War Trade Agreement.      Sir M.

Turkey to withhold theseentirely,  they must purchase the Turkish agricultural produce which Turkey would in that case be unable to sellto Germany.      Mr,  Gross expressed surprise at mr.
