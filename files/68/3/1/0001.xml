BURMAFIRTH IDRTNIGHTLY REPORT submitted by the Secretary ofState Tor Burma, covering the period 1st to 15th November,1939.(previous Report - Paper W.P.(R)(39) 67).The country generally remains quiet.PoliticalOn the 7th November the Governor held his usualweekly informal meeting with his Ministers and delivered to them the statement in regard to   Burma&apos;s prospects of constitutional advancement, which was approved by theCabinet, on Saturday, 4th November, 1939.  (Reference WarCabinet Paper W.P.(G)(39) 66).   Of his six Ministersunfortunately only three were present, the finance minister being ill and the Home Minister and ForestMinister being absent in Mandalay.The &quot;Freedom bloc&quot; led by the ex-Premier, Dr. BaMaw, criticised the statement as useless and also on theparticular ground that it was addressed to the Ministersana not to the country at large.   Press criticisms were tothe same effect and also disputed tne doctrine that thecircumstances of Burma and India in the constitutionalfield are different, while one Burmese paper complainedCopy no war CABINET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT).secret.P.(R)(39) 86

that not only was the statement vagus in itself but it gaveno definite time-table in regard to the constitutional advance of Burma,At his weekly meeting with his Ministers on 14thNovember, the Governor was asked by the Premier toelucidate the meaning of his statement in relation to burma&apos;s attainment of Dominion Status and repeated a complaint made publicly by U Ba pe that, when 1 explained the meaning of Dominion Status in the House of Lords on 7th November, I limited the application of my explanationto India and did not apply it to Burma.Some further statement may have to be made in thenear future, preferably, I think, by the Governor, and Iam giving careful attention to the form of words whichcould suitably be used.On the 6th November an organisation of the youngermembers of the Buddhist priesthood, who are much immersedin politics, contrary to the tenets of their religion,held a meeting apparently with the intention of forming a&quot;united front&quot;, no doubt of a nationalistic outlook, inwhich the existing political groups might be merged. Themeeting, however, seems to have failed to reach agreement as to how to attain its objective.Press.The Burmese press has been largely concerned withcriticism of the Governor&apos;s statement of November 7th, but,apart from that, has, under the influence of the government publicity Department, contained much matter solidly opposedto Nazi ideology and warmly supporting the Allies&apos;determination to pursue the war aims that have been stated.

oIn view of the anxiety of many European Britishsubjects of military age to come home to join thecombatant forces, the departure of such persons from burma without the permission of the General OfficerCommanding has been prohibited, in order to secure thatthose who are essential in Burma in occupations of value for the conduct of the War or for Burma&apos;s own military requirements can be retained.3.EXETERNAL RELATIONS&quot;jNothing to report.ECONOMIC.(a) Internal.Nothing to report.(b) External.-ditto-(Initialled)    Z.Richmond Terra c e , S.
