9 n 1A ii&apos; 3DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).T. COPY NO.    ^C)(R) (39) 117WAR cabinet civil DEFENCE REPORT NO.   9.Ninth Report submitted &quot;by theMinister of Home Security covering the period from Midnight 26th November to midnight 10th December, 1939.(Previous Report:    Paper No. WAP    (R) (59) 99)Enemy Air Attack.1. There have been no bombing raids during the periodbut movements of unidentified or hostile aircraft gave riseto warnings on several occasions, mainly in the Firth of Fort)district- and in the East Coast areas from Grimsby to the thames Esturary.Air Raid Precautions Services.2, Two important decisions have been taken in the last fortnight affecting the conditions of service of civil defence volunteers(a) One obstacle to the extended use of part-time volunteers, which would permit a reduction in the numbers of whole-time paid volunteers, was the doubt as to their35availability during working hours.        Following an agreement reached with the Joint Committee of Employers Organisationslocal authorities have now been authorised to compensate parttime volunteers who lose wages by doing Civil Defence dutiesduring their working time, up to a maximum in respect of a working day of 10/- for men and 7/- for women.    In addition,This problem was referred to in Civil Defence Report No. 7paragraph 3.

the large industrial and commercial estahlishmente which,under the Civil Defence Act,  have heen required to organiseparties for fire fighting,  first aid and anti-gas measures,have agreed that these parties may he summoned hy the localauthority if a serious emergency arises and will thusconstitute an important potential reserve.(h)  Secondly,  local authorities have heen empoweredto grant annual leave to whole-time paid volunteers on thebasis of one day for each completed month of whole-timecontinuous service, up to a maximum of 12 days per annum.They have also heen asked to arrange, where practicable, for volunteers to be released from duty this year on one of the christmas or New Year holidays and to give special considerationto applications for leave from the relatives of men serving with the Forces who are to be on leave during the Christmasseason.Lighting Restrictions.3. As the result. ofL,a further meeting of the ministerial committee on Lighting Restrictiona^..an^Xnter-lteparirmentalConference has been set up under the Chairmanship of LordKnollys to examine the external lighting at present permittedfor railways,  docks.,  shipyards,  factories and other undertakings of national importance, with a view to seeing(a) whether full use  is being made of the standards of lighting at present permitted-    and(b) whether it is necessary in the national interest to permit at certain points a higher standard of lighting.In this examination the Conference has regard to the policy recommended by the Air Staff,  that subject to certain

ry y-i ^conditions, relaxation may be possible at undertakings west of a line 50 miles from the East Coast.    In order to assistthe undertakings to make full use of the permitted standards,the Electrical Inspectors of the Department are examining the problem in the chief establishments, beginning with theimportant shipyards and docks,  and have authority from theConference to authorise adjustments (within certain limits)in co-operation with the Police,4. Meanwhile final tests have been carried out of theproposed modified form of street lighting,  and a device forilluminating shop windows has been authorised.    authority has also been given for the display of illuminated signsto show that a shop is open for business.5, Further progress has been made in the experimentsdesigned to increase the amount of lighting that may besafely provided in trains..6. Satisfactory progress in the extinction of burringspoil heaps is reported by the Alkali Inspectors of the Ministryof Health and the Department of Health for Scotland.    Three-quarters of the anti-glare schemes designed for iron andsteel works have been approved,Casualty Services..7, On Sunday,  December 10th,  the number of vacant beds in England and Pales was approximately 150,000     There has been no appreciable reduction during the past fortnight,  althoughas the present figure certainly includes a small number ofadditional beds both in existing hospitals and in huts whichhave oome into use during the fortnight,  the figure indicates that there has been some increase in the number of sick in

9   0hospital.    Military sick continue to increase, however, and towhat extent the figure represents an increase of civiliansick it is not possible to estimate, though reports from theprovinces show that in all regions the sick are beingadmitted to hospital almost as freely as in normal times.8. In Scotland the number of beds available was 11,400.In response to a request from the Army Council the ScottishDepartment have arranged to make available for light militarycases up to 1,800 beds in civilian hospitals in the EmergencyHospital Scheme.    This arrangement :1s distinct from thatrelating to Army personnel in urgent need of hospital treatment, who will continue to be admitted as a matter ofcourse to hospitals in the Emergency Scheme.9. The Health Departments continue to make every effort to accelerate completion of the hutted hospital schemes.    Itis estimated that by the end of this month huts capable of accommodating over 22,000 heds in England and &quot;Vales and 5,000in Scotland will have been covered in,  and will thereforebe capable of use in a serious emergency.      A number of these,accommodating over  12,000 and 2,000 heds respectively, willhave been fully completed.10. The chief enemy to progress with the huts has beenthe wet weather,  although there are difficulties with thesupply of materials, more particularly with regard to timber.The Office of Works are doing everything they can to arrangefor the use of alternative materials.11. In Scotland,  in view of the present acute shortageof timber,  it has been decided to substitute bricks andconcrete for timber in the hutted hospitals under construction,

Civil Defence Report No.  8,  paragraph 15.so far as this is possible without unduly delaying thecompletion of the work.12. Up to date,  about 50 per cent,  of the whole-timespecialists and consultants in the Emergency Medical Servicehave definitely accepted the revised terms of service,  ata part-time salary of  500,  referred to in the last report and are therefore available for ordinary private practice and clinics.      This is a reasonably satisfactory response.13. A Nursing Inspector of the status of matron is beingattached to the Hospital Officer in charge of each of theCivil Defence Regions to supervise the organisation ani useof the Civil Nursing Reserve and to advise the HospitalOfficer generally on the staffing of Emergency Hospitalswith nurses.Emergency Health Measures.14. Evidence is already accumulating that the expected increase in the incidence of venereal disease,  as a resultof war conditions,  is occurring, not only among the troopsbut also in the civil population.      The question of an exchequer grant to assist local authorities to expandtheir treatment facilities by the provision of mobile unitsis under discussion between the Treasury and the Ministry    ofHealth.Evacuation.15. Although parents appear to have responded well to the invitation not to bring their children back with them onthe occasion of the first    Sunday (December 3rd) on which

9 r? -ocheap railway fares to the receiving areas were available,  thedrift hack continues.    Further information is being obtainedfrom the evacuating authorities to show the numbers who have returned.    Reports from 50 out of 81 evacuating authoritiesin England show that out of approximately 630,000 schoolchildren who were evacuated from their areas, about 206,000or. 33 per cent,  have now returned.      The figure for london is 26-g- per cent; for Manchester and Sheffield it is over 50per.  cent.      The percentage of mothers and young children whohave returned is considerably higher.    Out of approximately383,000 who were evacuated from these areas,  about 246,000or 64 per cent,  have now returned.16. The rate of the drift back has been slower - duringthe last few weeks.    London figures show that approximately23,00 school children have returned during the four weeks ended December 3rd as compared with 24,000 in the preceding3 weeks.17. In Scotland the latest complete figures are based onreturns made by receiving authorities about six weeks ago.According to th se figures about 40 per cent,  of the 75,000evacuated school children and 65 per cent,  of the 97,500evacuated mothers and pre-school children have returned.    an up-to-date estimate of the number of school children who havedrifted back to Glasgow - the largest Scottish sending area -shows that about 60 per cent,  have now returned.    It seems probable that despite the efforts which are being made toretain the evacuated children in the receiving areas aconsiderable number will come home for Christmas and New Year.18. Consultation with the Scottish Advisory Committee onEvacuation and with representatives of receiving authoritieshas shown that there would be great reluctance in the

9 rj 3receiving areas to receive a renewed influx of evacuatedpersons from the existing sending areas.19. Reports received from different parts of the countryindicate that the authorities in receiving areas are makingevery effort to give a good    Christmas to the children whostay there,  and that the evacuating authorities have respondedreadily to the invitation that people of their towns should contribute to the cost.    An appeal for this purpose has heenissued in the London areas,  and the London County council have started the fund with a contribution of  5,000:    otherevacuating authorities appear to be taking similar action.20. The first trains carrying visitors from London,Edinburgh,  and Dundee to the reception areas under thexarrangements referred to in the last Report    ran on 3rdDecember,      The services from London were well patronised,but the numbers travelling from Edinburgh and Dundee weredisappointing.    Further trains ran from London on the 10thDecember,  and on the 17th trains will he run also fromManchester,  Salford,  Liverpool and Birkenhead and from theNorth East Coast evacuation areas.Public  Order.21, Public order and morale remain good.    There are signs however that the public is becoming lax in such matters as the carrying of gas masks and the observance of lighting restrictions^22. There has heen an increase of crime  (Chiefly larcenyand petty theft) though in many areas figures are still belowCivil Defence Reoort No.  8,  paragraph 23.

9 o ^f&apos;v 0 &apos;ijnormal.      The Commissioner of Police attributes the increasein the Metropolitan Police District,  where the November figures were only 5% below those for November,  1938,  as compared withdrops of 28% and 21% in the September and October figures,partly to the longer nights,  and partly to a greaterfamiliarity with blackout conditions and a growing realisation of the difficulties of detection.23. In the Metropolitan Police District the street accidentrate during blackout hours has also increased.      Elsewherethere seems to have been little change.24. Interest in enemy broadcasts is said to be waningbut there is some concern- that news of losses is sometimesreported by German and even French and Irish stations before it is reported in this country.Railways.25. The appeal made to trade and industry to reduce thetime for loading and unloading wagons has not been effective.There has been an increase in the number of wagons standingunder load each woek since the appeal was made and,   inaccordance with the decision of the Home Policy Committee onthe 29th November,  new demurrage regulations will come intoforce on the 15th December.Docks and Harbours.26. The ports are working normally and have ample storage accomodation.     It has not been necessary to make any furtherdiversion from the East Coast on account of enemy mine laying.Conditions generally are satisfactory except for some shortageof railway wagons at certain ports.

Oi o -i&amp; 01Ministry of Home Security,Home Office,Whitehall,14th December,  1939.Road Transport.-27. The position as regards hoth goods and passengerroad transport remains generally satisfactory.      A slightfurther reduction in goods vehicle fuel consumption has takenplace &quot;but it is hardly likely,  in view of seasonal trade,that any furthe reduction can he made before the end of theyear.Alternative Accommodation for Government Staffs.28. Arrangements are in hand for the release of allNorth-West London schools requisitioned in connection with theGovernment Departments Evacuation Scheme;    their return tothe Education Authorities is subject to an understanding thatit may still be necessary for the Government to take occupationat 48 hours&apos;  notice in the event of there being heavy air raids on -^ondon.J.A.
