1 Cs n-I *j QINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,1.     There have been no trade disputes of importance and the adjustment of wages to meet the increase in the cost of living since war began continuesto be negotiated without serious difficulty through the constitutednegotiating machinery in the various industries.2,     The tendency for Trade Union membership to increase, previously reported, continues.     The significance of this is not only that there isamong the workers increased interest in wages and working conditions butalso that there is confidence in the constitutional machinery through whichthe unions operate.3.     There is a certain amount of unrest in the road transport industry,particularly on the passenger service side,,     This is one of the industries in which claims for wages have not yet been disposed of and in addition there are special difficulties in working owing to the black out and revisedschedules and limited running consequent on petrol rationing.4.     General wage increases have been reported in a number of industries,and claims have been put forward or are in course of negotiation in severalimpoz-tant industries, including Railways, General Engineering and road passenger Transport.     The movement for improving statutory minimum ratesof wages in the trades governed by the Trade Boards Acts is gathering force.5.     Many enquiries and requests for advice are being received both from employers and trade unions on the question of the adjustment of wages tomeet increases in the cost of living.     There is a general recognition ofthe danger of allowing wages to chase prices and there have been suggestions that some guidance as to the best policy to be followed in the national interest should be given by the Government.EMFLQMENT AMD UNEMPLOYMENT.6.     As has now oeen announced, the normal monthly Live Register count of13th November shows a nett decrease of 28,050 unemployed as compared with16th October.7.     Although there is a welcome decrease in unemployment in the industriesconnected with the War, there are increases.still being recorded in the

1? 0 1*1-building industry.     These increases are partly seasonal and partly due tothe necessary restrictions upon the use of timber consequent on theshortage of supply.Aliens.8.     The Home Secretary has now made his Order allowing the employment of aliens in this country, subject to the permission of the Minister of Labourand National Service.Supplemsntary Register.9.     Arrangements are now under way to establish a Supplementary Registerfor unemployed persons of the class which does not normally use theEmployment Exchanges.   A temporary procedure was set up at the outbreak ofWar but some more permanent machinery has proved to be necessary.The following note shows the position in particular industries:-Building.10.   At 13th November 129,388 workers were unemployed in the buildingindustry, of whom 34,067 were in the skilled occupations and 33,521 werepainters.11.   This total represents an increase of 12,336 as compared with30th October and 38,806 as compared with 14th August.12.   Reports from the Divisions show that the Industry is now almost whollydependent on Government building and Air Raid Precaution work.     Thecontinued need for the strictest control over releases of building timberhas resulted in the cessation of most non-essential municipal private andspeculative building work with consequent heavy increases in unemploymentin residential areas formerly dependent on it.13.    In spite of this dislocation of civil work and the recent heavyincreases in unemployment the total of 129,388 unemployed at 13th Novemberis still appreciably less than in November last when 160,104 building workers were unemployed.Coal Mining.14.   Employment in the mines has continued to improve though there is stillshort time working in some areas due to the slowing up of shipping or ashortage of trucks for transport.     In Durham, where delays in shipment

4 r\ rihave caused difficulty, an agreement has &quot;been reached to provide facilities for loading on Sunday in several ports and this should do much to expedite despatch,pfbar jytining and Quarrying.15.   Attention has recently teen directed to the increasing unemployment in slatequarrying, which has resulted from the falling off in the demand for slate.Wales is naturally the area most affected since it contains over 86 per cent ofthe insured workers in the quarrying industry.Textiles.16.   The general position of the industry has continued to improve and shortages of skilled workers, &quot;both male and female, in several branches of the industry have been reported..17.   In the cotton spinning industry, Government orders for yarn have hadnoticeable effect.Clothing.18.   The increasing demand for the Services has made itself felt, particularly inthe wholesale tailoring and waterproof clothing trades.     Skilled tailoresses and power machinists are much in demand and additional workpeople are being taken on for training.     A number of cases have been reported in whioh employers have applied for permission to extend the hours of work for women and juveniles laiddown by the Factory Acts.19.   The curtailment of imports has benefited employment in the hoot and shoetrade but there is some apprehension amongst employers as to future suppliesof leather.Fishing.20.   While the improvement mentioned in previous reports has been maintained,there is inevitably still much uncertainty in the industry which has been aggravated by the events of the last week.     The need for additional mine-sweepershas prevented the release of some of the trawlers by the Admiralty and increasing demand for trawlermen for the mine-sweeping and patrol services has had its effect.In this connection it is interesting to note that trawlermen and firemen called upfor naval service from Wales are being replaced by men available at East coast ports, and that similar action has been taken in the case of Aberdeen, whereemployment in trawling has been extremely good.2l*   The loss of the foreign market for herring has caused much unemployment inthe fish curing industry in Scotland; Stornoway, Buckie, Fraserburgh andpeterhead being principally affected.

22.   On the whole, employment has remained good in the docks and has been fairlywell spread.     The relaxation of diversion of shipping from the East Coast hashad a noticeable effect in London where unemployment was down to the peace timelevel in this industry in the latter part of November.     Ports on the East and north Eastern coasts have, however, been affected in the last few days, both by enemy action and bad weather and their immediate prospects are less favourable.Hull appears already to have been affected but it is too soon yet to predict whatthe full effect on employment will be as a result of the intensified hostile action.Other Transport.23,   Road transport has continued to be adversely affected by petrol restrictions and the garage trade is likely to be further hit at the end of the year whencurrent licences expire.Shipping Services.24.   Shortages of able-bodied seamen and engineers are being experienced andefforts are being made with some success to bring seamen down from Scottish and north Eastern ports and to recruit unemployed fishermen.     At the outbreak of war there was a considerable reserve of men in the Western Isles of Scotland, but manyof them have now sailed from Cardiff or from Scottish ports.     The whole questionof facilitating speedy recruitment for ships is being examined at the present time,but it must be remembered that many of the unemployed men are stewards, etc. , whohave lost employment owing to the curtailment of ocean passenger services.     Deckand engine room ratings are quickly absorbed.Engineering.25.   There is an unsatisfied demand for most types of skilled workers.     Inparticular, demands are very heavy for Precision Fitters, Sheet Metal Workers,Tool Makers, Tool Setters, and the various classes of highly skilled machineoperators.26.   There are indications that the Relaxation of Custom Agreement has been successfully applied in some instances, but progress seems to be slow.     On theother hand, it is encouraging to note signs of an increased willingness on the partof employers to meet the shortage by accepting men of second best industrialquality, or older men who would not normally be accepted.     Extensive overtime isalso reported, and in a few instances women have been engaged to meet the shortageof men..   The Factory Acts have been relaxed at some places to enable the extensionof shift working to be carried out.     At Attercliffe and Halifax employers decidedto dispense with night shift working owing to falling off in production due tos*dued lighting. 4&apos;

9P: n&apos;v ,y yAircraft.27.     The demand for all types of skilled v/orkers in the industry continuesto he large throughout the country.     It is anticipated that there will be aserious labour shortage at Coventry, where three nev/ Shadow Factories arebeing built.Shipbuilding.28. The demands for skilled workers in this industry are particularly heavy.Manufacture of Metals.29.     Although there have been certain local shortages, there has been a fairly adequate supply of labour in these industries.     In some areasdifficulty was experienced in working to maximum capacity owing to blackoutrestrictions, but firms are taking all possible steps to overcome this difficulty.     The production of special steel has increased considerably inthe Sheffield area and all plant is working to capacity.Explosives and Chemicals.30.     The labour position at production factories is on the whole fairly satisfactory.     In connection with factories where construction is not yetcompleted steps have been taken to estimate the anticipated requirements, and large numbers of women have been registered in anticipation of demands.At Euxton, Chorley, the remaining stages of construction work are proceeding at a rapid rate.     Daily engagements of men and women within dailytravelling distance are being made for the various departments already in production, the present labour force amounting to 2,200 men and boys andover 1,500 women and girls.     Importation of workpeople from other areas will shortly have to he considered, and particulars of lodging accommodation arebeing compiled by the Exchanges.Clerical and Office V/orkers.31.     Although in some areas there have been heavy demands by GovernmentDepartments, unemployment amongst clerical and other &quot;black-coated&quot; workers,has increased.     This is particularly the case in the London area, where theevacuation of businesses to less vulnerable districts continues to effectemployment adversely.Distributive Trades.32. Employment in the distributive trades is still variously affected in theevacuation and reception areas.     In many large towns in the danger zones

9tf -*unemployment has increased.     The early closing of shops on account of the black-out restrictions continues to affect the position adversely, and morewomen have been discharged.     In a number of &quot;reception&quot; areas off-seasonslackness in trade has been counteracted by the increased business resultingfrom the presence of evacuees.Miscellaneous.53.     Unemployment in the Entertainment and Sport Industry continues heavyowing to the curtailment of sporting events and entertainments generally.The London area is suffering severely.34-     Employment amongst garage hands continues to suffer from the restric-tion of road transport.      The Laundry trade, particularly in London, is stillaffected owing to large scale evacuation.     London Division reports muchunemployment of men between 18 and 25 years of age, owing to the statutoryliability placed upon employers to reinstate men after military service.CENTRAL REGISTER.35.     The number of engagements reported since the outbreak of war is 1,452.There are 2,748 submissions still outstanding.36.     During the fortnight under review orders for a further 267 people were received and 757 people were submitted to meet these vacancies.TRAINING.37.     Recruitment of unemployed civilians for the Government Training Centrescontinues at a satisfactory rate.     The demand for the men trained at theseCentres is no?/ much greater&apos; than the number who can be turned out.     Arrange-ments have been concluded with the War Office for the admission of a firstbatch of 400 soldiers to enter training at Government Training Centres andLocal Training Centres as Army tradesmen on 11th December.38.     During the fortnight one further Centre for the training of women forcanteen, etc., work has been opened by the Central Committee onWomen&apos;sTraining, bringing the total up to nine.JUVENILES.Juvenile, Unemployment.39.     At 15th November, 1939, there were 40,460 boys and 59,892 girlsregistered as unemployed - a total of 100,352 juveniles aged 14-17.     Ascompared with 16th October, the boys&apos; register had decreased by 5,460

(8&apos;i of the October fignore) and the girls&apos; by 5,901 (9^ of the October figure).Except that the boys1 register in London had remained stationary, all Divisionsshewed an appreciable decreo.sc.RECRUITING.40.     On 1st December a second Proclamation was made by His Majesty The Kingunder the National Service (Armed Forces) Act.      The effect of the newProclamation is to extend the liability for military service to men of 22 andalso to those men who had reached the age of 20 after the 1st October and before the 2nd Ceceniber.      The registration of the men, which will be preceded by a widespread publicity campaign, will take place on Saturday, 9th December,and the arrangements for this are well in hand.      In order to avoid certain difficulties which have hitherto arisen from time to time in the correctapplication of the Schedule of Reserved Occupations every endeavour will bemade to obtain the most accurate information possible regarding each man&apos;soccupation, and to this end steps will be taken immediately following rogistra-tion to obtain from the employer of every man registered a confirmatory state-rnent of his employee&apos;s occupation.4-1.      In future a departure from the normal method of calling men up in strictdate of birth order will be made by deferring the calling up of men who arebelow the age of reservation for their particular occupation who are engaged on essential Government work.     No deferment of a man&apos;s calling up will,however, be made under these arrangements unless the application made by theman&apos;s employer is supported by the Government Department concerned.42.     The Medical Boards continue to work at full pressure end it has been necessary to set up additional Boards in several of the larger towns.43.     The total number of men called up under the National Service (Armed Forces)Act for service with the Army since the introduction of compulsory militaryservice is now 14-6,111.     In addition 7,445 men have been called up under theAct for service with the Navy and 2,626 for Air Force service.44.     Fourteen out of the fifteen Local Tribunals, which have been set up underthe Act to deal with the applications of men to be registered as conscientious objectors, are now functioning, and the most recent figures show that 2,143applications have been heard of which 299 or 14 per cent have been grantedunconditionally and 400 or 18 per cent rejected.      Of the remainder 935 menor 44 per cent of the total have been registered as conscientious objectors7.

l* o ,Jconditional on their undertaking certain civil work specified by the Tribunals,and 509 or 24 per cent of the total registered for service in the Forces but of a non-combatant nature only.      16G appeals have so far been lodged against these decisions.      The division of the Appellate Tribunal for England and AT alesmeets on 6th December.SCHEDULE OF RESERVED OCCUPATIONS.4.5.     A number of amendments have been made to the Schedule including, inparticular, reductions in the age of reservation of certain skilledengineering and foundry occupations.4-6.     These resulted from a review, in consultation with the service departments and representatives of employers and workpeople , of the relativerequirements for tradesmen in industry and the Armed Forces.      In view of theimmediate needs of industry for highly skilled engineering v/orkers, theService Departments agreed to accept less highly skilled men in a number of trades and thus ensure the retention in industry of the more highly skilledv/orker s.PROVISION FOR THE UNEMPLOYED AND FOR RELIEF OF DISTRESS.47o The number of cases in which allowances v/ere authorised or underconsideration was as follows:-	17.11.39	24.11.59UNElva?LOYl&apos;,IENT ASSISTANCE (including supplementary allowances to claimants for Unemployment Insurance Benefit).	401,000	400,000PREVENTION AND RELIEF OF DISTRESS (i) Evacuated persons (ii) Other cases	7,200 26,000	6,700        ! 26,000         \48.     In view of the rise in prices of essential commodities the unemployment assistance Board have submitted to the Minister draft Regulations providingfor an improvement of the existing standard of allowances.(Intd.)
