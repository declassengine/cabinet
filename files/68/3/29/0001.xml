Further financial particulars are givenin Part VI below.PART I.     GENERAL.2. A tabular statement of deliveries during the month underreview and the preceding two months is attached as an appendix to this report.3.   Meeting with Representatives of the Dominions and India,. Meetings have been held during the month with the visiting Ministers from the Dominions and with therepresentatives from India.Valuable information was obtained from the AustralianDelegation on surplus productive capacity of munitions andcertain raw materials\  and arrangements have been made forthe Ministry to be notified immediately there appears anylikelihood of an increase in Australian capacity for export.The possibility of obtaining timber from the EasternCanadian seaboard to reduce the ocean voyage was broached andis being investigated.      Assistance was requested from theCanadian Government in increasing available supplies of aluminium and explosives.Arrangements were made to place as soon as possible a firm order for small arms ammunition to the utmost extent ofthe capacity of South African factories to produce for export.The Indian Delegation was warned of the difficulty in meeting certain of their demands for war supplies in view of u.K.  needs,  and arrangements were made for the U,K. Governmentto place orders through the Indian War Supply Board except where there were ample supplies of the commodity available.

(ioJh      Britj^h^SuppIy Board in Canada and U.G.A.The amendment of the Neutrality Legislation by thePresident and Congress on the hth November enabled the british supply Board to begin operations in U.S.A.      Purchases therearc to be effected through the British Purchasing Commissionin the U.S.A.  with headquarters in New York.      Initial ordersfor the U.S.A.  exceeding  5,500,000 in value were placed bythe Ministry of Supply on the 8th November.The Prench Government have agreed that their purchases in Canada shall be made by the British Supply Board throughthe Canadian War Supply Board.      The Prench Mission in theUnited States will act in close co-operation with the BritishPurchasing Commission through a small Inter-Allied Board,the Chairman of which is Mr.  Purvis,      The co-ordination ofBritish and Prench purchases in the United States should secure the avoidance of unnecessary profits and the maintenanceof stable prices.      It is expected that the Inter-AlliedBoard will work in close contact with the Procurement Divisionof the United States Treasury.5,     Area organisation.Area officers have now been appointed at ten centres andexhibitions of simple munition stores are now opened wherecontractors can examine specimen items and receive adviceregarding tendering.      About 800 firms have submitted tendersas a result of those exhibitions, and particulars of new capacity from over 2,000 new firms have been obtained;  onlya relatively small proportion of those are likely to be of usein the near future.The formation of Area Boards has beun the subject ofdiscussion with the Admiralty and. Air Ministry,  and the settingup of Area Committees is being negotiated with the interests concerned.PaRT II.      MUNITION STORES.6. Among important items in which deliveries have improvedduring November are:-Octpber November3.7&quot; and h. 5&quot; A.A.

Pistols:    Capacity for producing 1+00 a week on a singleshift basis  is being provided under a new arrangement with Albion Motors.25 pdr.  and 2 pdr.Anti-Tank Equipments:    Extensions of capacity have been arranged on the basis of newjoint schemes,  and balancing plant has beenapproved to increase the output of existingcapacity,UP mm.  3ofors Equipments:    Additional machine tools havebeen approved for the Royal Ordnance Factory,Nottingham,  and Nuffield Mechanization to permit ofacceleration of output;  and further plant is beingerected for barrel capacity.Rifles:    A scheme has been approved for the provision ofa new factory op B.S.A.  for the manufacture of newrifles.Instruments:    Schemes have been approved to provide additional capacity for AO mm.  predictors and forbinoculars,Shell Steel:    Steps are being taken to provide a reserve of steel billets and shell forgings up to 100,000tons.      nil forgemasters have beon requested toobtain and retain a reserve sufficient for A weeksoutput of fo:&apos;,gi:igs based on their maximum production.Shell:    The detailed schemes for several new firms havebeen settled and will provide additional capacity for shell bodies,  cartridge cases and fuzes.      Thenecessary steps have been taken to obtain machine tools.Orders Abroad:The position generally in regard to orders abroad wassummarised in the report covering the month of October.Developments during November were as followsCanada and the United States. A number of additional itemshave been referred to the Special Mission, and the firms to whom the original orders in Canada are to be allottedhave been settled.      Arrangements have been made for theMission to take over responsibility for deliveries,inspection, payments etc.  on existing orders in canada and the United States.      The question of purchase of machine tools by the Mission is under consideration,  andarrangements have been made for a machine tool expert tojoin the Mission.      a Service officer with the necessary staff has already sailed to advise and assist on theproduction side aid additional staff for inspection isalso being provided:,.      The Mission have been instructedto place an additional order for A. A. predictors withthe Sperry Company.

9 f. *&amp; ci i.Ngwfoundland.    The question of placing ardors for shellin Newfoundland has been reconsidered hut,  on the advice ofthe Special Mission,  is not being pursued-Italy.    Officers have been sent out to inspectinstruments and light guns likely to be available; anorder for heightfinders is under negotiation.Greece..    A proposal to obtain shell and small arms ammunition from a factory in Greece is being explored.Hungary.  The prospect of obtaining munitions from Hungaryis not promising, but negotiations are being carried on with a view to obtaining completion of a pre-war contract for   mechanical fuzes,  in which case it may be necessaryto expedite mechanisms only in lieu of the complete fuzes.Belgium.    Satisfactory arrangements have been made inconnection with the Bofors guns which were beingmanufactured in Belgium under licence from the SwedishCompany.      13 out of the 19 guns involved have alreadybeen delivered to the B. E. F.  in France.Palestine.  A proposal to manufacture equipments for theArmy in Palestine has been the sub.icet of further discussion.      The prospects of munition production thereare negligible, but it may be possible to organise repairfacilities and the manufacture of miscellaneous generalstores.      This is now under discussion.India.    Initial orders were placed during October and thequestion of further orders is being examined.      Theprovision of shipping from India is at present a matter of serious concern.9.   Royal Ordnance Factories.Work at Bridgend and Glascoed has progressed satisfactorilyand ammunition filling work is about to commence at Bridgendfor Smoke Shell and at Glascoed for H. E.      Work was started atthe new filling factories at Swynnerton and V/arrington, and a site near Liverpool has been selected, for one of the two othernew factories.      The position in regard to 1+0 mm.  filling hasbeen reviewed;  additional capacity is being provided and steps have been taken to accelerate the completion of the capacityalready in hand, with the result that a substantial improvementin the filling of this class of shell will be obtained by themiddle of 191+0.At the T.N.T.   factory at Irvine 550 tons of T.N.T. were produced during the month.      The first unit at Pembrey is alsoworking satisfactorily and the second unit will startproduction in February.      Satisfactory progress is being madewith the ammonium nitrate factory at Pembrey and with thecordite factory at Bishopton.      Building contracts have beenplaced for the    T.N.T.  factory at Drigg and the cordite factory at Marchweil.

9*9(*J &apos;wi t-JThe first &quot;batch of fuzes from the fuze factory atBlackburn have passed proof and been accepted and productionreached 1,300 fuzes a week at the end of November,The new shell plant at Birtley is expected to startproduction in the next few weeks.First deliveries have been received from the pun factory at Dalmuir.      Construction work is proceeding rapidly at thenew gun factory at Leeds.      The ordering of machinery is wellin hand for the four additional gun factories approvedduring October.      Sites have been selected for three of these factories,  all of which are due for completion towards theend of 19h0.      Sites have been surveyed and machinery orderedfor the new rifle factory.Output at Nottingham has been maintained at a high leveland the work on U0 mm.  Bofor3 equipments has gone ahead wellduring the month,10.   Machir    Tools.The measures taken to expand the output of the trade naveproceeded rapidly during the month.      Additional capacity has been found in   he works of engineering firms who do not.normally manufacture machine tools, and about 150 of these areto undertake sub-contracting to the recognised machine toolmakers.Assisted, schemes for expansion are proceeding for some30 of the recognised machine tool makers.      Additionalbalancing plant to the value of approximately  500,000 has been order2d and further plant proposals amounting to 350,000 ore being examined.      The increase of output fr^omthese schemes is estimated at from 20 - 60 per cent,   acc ordingto the type of machine.      An over-all increase of about 30%per annum is in view,Development work is in hand on certain special types  of machines and facilities for the manufacture of machine too2swhich have previously been imported from Switzerland are being developed in this country.An organisation for dealing with the replacement of machines after air raids or other damage is being prepared.A scheme for spreading the manufacture of precisionoptical measuring instruments, which at present is highlyconcentrated,  is under consideration.11.  [mall.. Arms Arrmiunl tion..The position in regard to the supply of small arms ammunition has been the subject of a special review duringthe month.      All possible steps are being taken to accelerateproduction on the existing plant and the completion of thenew factories at Radway Green and Standish is being hastened.Orders have been placed in India, Australia and Canada andthe possibilities of further supplies from South Africa andother countries is being pursued.      An initial supply of 25million rounds from Canada has been obtained.As a result cf this review and discussion with theindustry proposals are now being put forward for increases of capacity iticlndi ng at least two additional factories,

CJ  s pfwi &quot;J: J12. Anti-Aircraft Searchlight Projectors.Production during the month was 169, bringing thetotal of these projectors to over 5,000.      Orders arc now almostentirely confined to the large 150 cm.  type, which is being produced at an increasing rate.13. Dannert Barbed Wire Coils.This obstacle was originally of German manufacture.Production from English works is now at the rate of about10,000 coils per week, and steps are bein^ taken to increase to over h0,000 per week by February, 19h0.lip R.D.F.  Sets.Regular production has commenced and sets are now being issued to the Troops.15. Transportation Equipment.hOO miles of standard gauge permanent way to the valueof  1,700,000 have been ordered for installation overseas,for delivery by 31st March, 19h0.Instructions have been issued to i he LocomotiveManufacturers and Carriage and Wagon Bu:.Iders Associationsrespectively to proceed with the manufacture of 2U0 (2-8-0)Freight Tender Engines and 10,000 20-ton covered Goods Wagonsfor use overseas in connection with the railway transportationarrangements for the British Expeditionary Force.      The costof these will be about  8,000,000.      Delivery arrangements are such as will ensure that the manufacturers have asufficient margin of capacity with which to deal with export orders.16. Explosives and Propellants:A Technical Adviser on Explosives to be attached to theBritish Purchasing Mission has sailed for Canada and theUnited States.It has been decided to seek financial approval for anextension of the Wrexham Cordite plant to produce an additional170 tons per week.      Further, the Admiralty have been asked to reconsider their decision to suspend the completion of thesecond cordite unit (capacity of 75 tons per week) atCaerwent and to produce for Army requirements.17. Explosives Materials and Intermediates:The phosphorous position has boon examined and steps are being taken to meet deficiencies by the provision of capacity for an additional 2,000 tons per annum at theworks of Messrs.  Albright and Wilson, Limited, of Oldbury,Arrangements have been made with the Clayton AnilineCompany Limited to duplicate their plant for the manufactureof 900 tons of carbamite per annum,      Negotiations are alsogoing forward to extend the capacity of Messrs, L.B. Holliday,Limited, for the production of the same material,,The necessary work has been put in hand for increasingby 15 tons per week the cotton waste capacity of theCotton Cellulose Company and further increases up to 375 tons

-7-A &apos;J. &apos;Jcper week are under discussion.Steps have been taken to purchase 4,000 tons of acetonefrom the U.S.A. and plans are being considered for additional capacity to be set up in this country.A Toluene Control Order was issued on 16th November.All materials containing more than 2% of Toluene are nowstrictly controlled and can only be acquired under licence.Issue of these licences is restricted to uses of national importance where no substitute is possible.      The erection ofadditional toluene plant at refineries is being urged.Efforts are being made to buy toluene from the U.S.A.toprevent any shortage in the early part of next year and thepossibility of producing toluene from cresol is being explored.18.   Chemical Supplies:Schemes for completing the two Chemical Defence FactoriesH.M.F. Wade and Valley, have now received financial approval.This, with schemes already approved, completes the plans for the first 600 tons of the 1,200 tons per week effortmentioned in WAP.   (39)58.Plans for producing the remaining 600 tons per week are well in hand and will involve two further factories.Arrangements have been made to provide the B.B.C.  capacityalso mentioned in W.P.  (39)58.19.   Anti-Gas Stores:The assembly of respirator extensions has started at theworks of Messrs. Boots, and up to date 139,000 have been produced.20.   Bleaching Powder:The requirements of the Home Office and of the services have been re-estimated and show a considerable reduction.      Thebleaching powder position is thereby adequately secured by existing facilities, and the corresponding saving in chlorineproducing capacity can be applied to balancing the chlorinerequirements of the Valley &quot;H&quot; Works.PART III    -    EQUIPMENT AND GENERAL STORE.21.   Timber.The difficulty in regard to timber supplies referred toin the report for October has developed rapidly and is nowsufficiently acute for the Central Priority organisation tohave decided on a scheme of rationing all Departments.      Theoverhaul of specifications of all-wood articles has been takenin hand, and consideration is being given to the possible useof alternative materials.22&apos;   grouping of Woodwork Firms.The applications from woodworking firms all over thecountry to be added to the list of contractors continues to beso numerous that the system of grouping of firms in localitiesfor the purpose of tendering is now being adopted.

8 -23. Aduminium.The difficulty in regard to aluminium supplies for water bottles and mess tins was referred to in the lastreport.      The use of aluminium for general stores has nowceased altogether.      Increased capacity has, however, beenfound for the production of enamelled-iron water bottles,and no real difficulty is now apprehended in regard to eitherwater bottles or mess tins,2k. Tinning by Electrolytic process.Urgent research has been carried out in conjunctionwith the Tin Research Council oai the tinning of steel and tin-plate by a new process.      If the water bottle sore-tinned is acceptable to the War Office, the production ofwater bottles should be further safeguarded and, ultimately,costs should be lower.25. Cardboard.The position of kraft-board and chip-board has become more difficult owing to the difficulties of importing wood pulp and the increasing scarcity of waste.26. Nissen Huts.By breaking up the specification into components andobtaining tenders from iron, steel and wood-working firmsseparately, very favourable delivery terms have been secured.The components will be delivered to Donnington, whence they/ill be despatched to Prance in co-ordinated quantities tofacilitate erection.      In consultation with the War Officeand the designers, the amount of timber to be used has beenreduced to a minimum.      Wood floors have been eliminated, and,on erection, the huts will be floored with cement  (withpossibly a linoleum covering).27. Flax and Cotton Substitute.Consequent upon the decision to accept cotton    in lieu of flax in a great number of articles of equipment thecoarse cotton market has been flooded and it is impossible at present to obtain all the necessary coarse cotton fromthe Lancashire Mills in the time required.      Representativesof the Ministry have visited Belgium and have purchased3,200 large tarpaulins and 600,000 yards of duck.      further action is being taken with a view to additional extensivepurchases in Belgium.A conference is being held in Manchester with a viewto utilising for the production of coarse cotton a numberof looms in Northern Ireland which normally would be engagedupon linen production.28- Revision of Specifications.A meeting was held during the month with representatives from the various Trades Panels which are advising on theproduction of clothing and textiles.      The representatives were asked to consider whether production could be increased&quot;by modifying specifications without unduly affecting theefficiency of the articles to be manufactured.      Representatives

tit &apos;ii y9 -of the Air Ministry and the Admiralty were present at thismeeting and the Trade representatives unanimously stressed the point that it would he helpful, in dealing with theproblems of production, if the whole Service requirements couldDe codified.29. no-ordination of Demands.All Government Departments have been invited to submit their requirements for the forthcoming year to the wool Controller in order that he may be able to plan more effectively for meeting their needs.      Steps are being taken with a view to all Service demands for articles made of wool, cotton, flax,  jute, hemp and leather, being furnished tothe Ministry and passed on to the various Controllers.30. Out-stations for Hosiery and Boots.A new office for the planning of hosiery production has 1now been opened at Loughborough and a survey of the wholeproductive capacity of the country is in progress.      A scheme has been agreed to bring into production for Service needsthe entire manufacturing capacity of the country and contractswill in future be allocated on a costed basis instead of bytender.      The Admiralty and the Air Force have signified their willingness to inform the Ministry of their requirements up toMay, 19h0, so that the planning for the three Services may bearranged without competition.      The office for boots will besituated in Kettering and the procedure will be similar to that adopted for hosiery.PART IV.    RAW MATERIALS.3h Progress has been made with the machinery for relatingthe needs for transport of raw materials with the arrangements of the Ministry of Shipping for directing shipping to the mose essential purposes.      The shipping position however still givescause for great anxiety;    much material that has been boughtcannot immediately be shipped here.32. Iron and Steel.Home production continues to expand but demand is very heavy and many civil requirements remain unsatisfied.Imports of semi-finishod steel from the Continent have notheen coming in so freely as was hoped and discussions are proceeding with the French and Belgian industries on the subject.On the -Ihth November, the Control of Iron and Steel(No.5) (Scrap) Order, 1939, was issued.      This Order remediedcertain anomalies in the price schedules of the earlier order and took power to enable price additions to be made for specialcosts of collection from remote districts.      It also allowedmaximum prices to be fixed for any type of scrap not coveredhy the Order.33,  aagsten.Negotiations for contracts for the bulk purchase of wolfram are still in progress.      The producers concerned agreedto accept the terms offered after the co-operation of the burma Government had been sought.      It will also be necessaryfor the Burma Government to regulate exports by refusingiicences to all destinations except the U.K.   and France.

3il. Chrome.Authority has teen obtained for the purchase of theTurkish output of chrome up to 200,000 tons and. also theproduction (in so far as it is obtainable) of certainYugoslav mines.      The Greek output is also to be bought.These measures are pre-emptive and will result in theacquisition of stocks of chrome greatly in excess of our requirements.      Arrangements are accordingly being made to market the excess through the Chrome Company.35- C0PPeV2... 1 ead and zinc.During the month revised estimates have been preparedby Government Departments of their requirements of copper,lead and zinc, and the position in regard to copper wasconsidered by the Joint Production and Materials PrioritySub-Committee.      The conclusion reached, after scaling down the estimates, was that additional supplies of copper wouldbe needed especially having regard to the needs of the exporttrade and other civil purposes and discussions are in progress with a view to increasing Rhodesian production.The French  ire anxious to obtain additional suppliesof copper including cartridge strip and blister copper forcopper sulphate.      In regard to cartridge strip, it is hoped to arrange to give the French some assistance if the necessaryraw materials can be spared.      It will not be possible tomeet their whole requirements of rough copper for coppersulphate, but arrangements are being made to secure a smallsupply from Rhodesia to meet their immediate needs.Authority has been obtained for the purchase of anadditional quantity of lead from Mount Isa, Queensland, andit is hoped that with this purchase supplies will be adequate.In regard to zinc, the French are experiencing difficultyin obtaining sufficient electrolytic quality, and arrangements are under consideration to assist them by purchasing zincconcentrates to be smelted for them in Norway.      The norwegian government is, however, at present restricting experts.36. Aluminium.The Control of Aluminium No.h.  Order made the MiniBtry,as from 20th November, the sole seller of virgin aluminiumand virgin aluminium alloy    in the U.K.Estimates furnished by the various Government departments of their requirements of aluminium were considered by theJoint Production and Materials Priority Sub-Committee onthe iOth November, and it was agreed that severe rationingwould be necessary and that the expanding needs of theAir Ministry made it important to secure increased supplies.Schemes for increased production in this country are under active consideration and discussions have been opened withthe Canadian producers with a view to increasing productionthere.   factories.The Refractories Committee already set up has formed a company to make collective purchases for the industry.    TheAir Ministry are co-operating in regard to their supplies ofwagnesite for magnesium production, and the representativesBent out to South Eastern Europe have made substantialPurchases of magnesite.

38. sulphuric Acid:    Raw Materials.(a) Pyrites.Negotiations for the purchase of pyritos are nov; tobe undertaken on the basis of centralised purchase by theMinistry.(b) Sulphur.The Ministry expert sent to Italy succeeded in agreeing prices, for 70,000 tons, which compared favourablyv/ith those offered by the Italians to other countries.39. Fertilisers.(a) Superphosphate of lime and compound fertilisers.An Order has been issued, dated November 7th,establishing maximum prices for November and December ofsuperphosphates and compound fertilisers.(b) SuPohate of ammonia.Prices have so far been held voluntarily.      In viewof increases in the cost of manufacture, authorisation has beengiven to increase the price of sulphate of amuonia by 8s. aton and &quot;Nitro-Chalk&quot; by 3s.6d. a ton, as from 1st December.The proposal mentioned in the last report to issue a general export licence to the British Sulphate of AmmoniaFederation to cover an amount largely in excess of the september and October exports has been agreed in consultationwith the Ministry of Agriculture and the Board of Trade.kO. Molasses, alcohol, etc.(a) Molasses.An Order embodying a revised price schedule formolasses came into force on the 8th November.(b) Acetone.To supplement U.K. production, authority has beenobtained for an immediate purchase of 120 tons of acetone from belgium and a further purchase of h,000 tons from the U.S.A.  tosafeguard the position until the end of next year at least.41. Bichromates of Sodium and Potassium.Owing to the heavy pressure on the available suppliesof these salts, which are in demand for khaki dyeing, leathertanning and paint manufacture,  the Joint Production and materials Priority Sub-Committee has decided that supplies tothe paint manufacturers except for camouflage purposes should boreduced, that the quantities so released should be allocated to firms in the cotton and leather industries engaged on essentialproduction, and that a quantity should be permitted for export to India and Australia.Calcium Carbide.Approval has been given to a further increase of  2.10s.per ton in the price of industrial calcium carbide (which is

Shipments have come forward-very well and the stock now hold, equal to 5 to 6 months1requirements, is somewhat greater than at the end of Augustlast.U3. Timber.The value of timber so far purchased is over, 8,000,000,      Stocks have decreased during the month and atpresent the quantity of sawn soft wood available and insight is roughly equal to three months&apos;  consumption.Shipping remains the difficulty.      Largo purchases have beenmade in Canada but few ships have been available.Sanction has been obtained to an expenditure of 1,000,000 for the provision of pitprops from Newfoundland,Labrador and Eastern Canada.      Delivery will take placeJune - October, 19h0.      It is proposed to form a syndicateof shipping agents to arrange for credit and supervisionon the spot.Fourteen ships have now arrived with timber under thebarter    deal with Russia and a number of others are dueshortly.In view of the acute shortage of soft woods it has been necessary for the Central Priority Organisation to review thewhole Timber requirements of Government Departments both for1 building and for other purposes;      In the case of building,each Department has been given a ration of timber, and a procedure for relating the timber controller&apos;s releases of timber to each Department&apos;s ration has been adopted.      this procedure covers a total requirement of some 500,000 standardsfor which 153,000 standards have been allotted.      There remaindemands for other purposes of over 800,000 standards, andthe extension of the rationing procedure is being considered.The shortage of supplies has increased the importanceof the Economy Branch of the Timber Control.      Active steps are being taken to examine specifications with a view toeconomy and an ad hoc committee has been established in the priority Organisation consisting of representatives of major consuming Departments, of the Timber Control EconomyBranch and of trade representatives for this purpose.kh. Paper.Supplies of wood pulp are arriving in larger quantitiesthan was expected and sanction has been obtained for a programme of importation of paper-making materials to thevalue of  1h,589,000 in a full year from October, 1939.Eaparto is scarce owing to shipping difficulties.hides and Skins, Leather and Tanning materials.The Imported Hide Pool purchased freely during November,supplies except for calf skins being plentiful at steadyprices.      Negotiations with the French Government have been successful in securing the release to this country from france of a regular supply of calf skins.      New maximum prices for Indian tanned kips (semi-tanned hides) were fixed byOrder on 2nd November;    these appear to be adequate, as,after a period of hesitation, offers are being made freely.

9^,1l,i O &apos;JNegotiations are proceeding with Australia andNew Zealand, with a view to improving the supply of hidesfrom those countries.1+6. Rubber.In view of the active commercial buying by the U.S.A.(where stocks are low) the U.S.  Government has been askedto agree to an extension of the shipment period for &quot;barter&quot;rubber (at present 31st March, 1940) to,  if possible,30th September next, so as to avoid undue pressure on themarket.      The request is still under consideration.47. Hemp.Negotiations for the purchase of i0,000 tons of italian hemp are almost completed and discussions arcproceeding concerning additional quantities.      The Governmentreserve of sisal is being increased to 10,000 tons and indian hemp is being bought on Government account.      AnOrder has been issued controlling dealings abroad in allhemps.      Arrangements have been made for French requirements to be purchased through the U.K.  Controller.48. Flax.A scheme for expanding home production is about tobe put into operation and arrangements have been made forthe purchase of the 1939 Eire crop,      The purchase of continental flax seed for the expansion of Irish cultivationin 1940 is being arranged.
