Colonel Reitz intimated biswillingness to accept even obsolete equipment. An offer has been made of early part-supply of some of these items. This offer, although covering only a small partof South Africa&apos;s ultimate requirements, can only be improved at the expense ofBritish troops and of other Dominion, Colonial and Allied Forces.23.
