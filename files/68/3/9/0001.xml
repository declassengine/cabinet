IS f&quot;i dMINISTRY OF ECONOMIC WARFARE.Report of Action Taken for Week ending November 26th.&apos;   1*      War Trade Agreements and Relations with Neutral Countries-.The chief event of the week has been the announcement by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the 21st.November of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s decision to take action against enemy exports.      This dec-isdon. has--arousedprotests from a number of neutrals,  that from the netherlands government being in particularly strong terms.      The Order-in-Council authorising the seizure of enemy exports wasmade on the 27th. November.      It will of course be sometimebef ore^tlie-nma-cnxnery or-e^uioseoV for- the e^cecxrtio-n-of -the.,new policy can be completed and it will be introducedgradually.2.      It is still not yet possible to sign the trade agreement with Sweden,   though a final settlement of outstanding points is in sight.      It is hoped that theagreement with the Belgian Government will be signed very shortly, but it now seems uncertain whether any agreementwith the Netherlands Government will be possible.3.      The situation in the various countries is breifly as follows:-SWEDEN.h.      The negotiations have been proceeding and thereare now outstanding,  in addition to the Payments Agreementbetween the Bank of England and the Swedish Riksbank,  thepoints regarding our purchases from Sweden and the Swedishright to have prohibited commodities processed in Germany,which were referred to in the last Report.      Progress hasbeen made on both these questions,  and it is hoped that theymay be settled within the next few days.

.&apos; 05.      The negotiations have also teen affected by thedecision to seize enemy exports.      The first difficulty is that the ordinary procedure for the granting by H,M .Consular Officers of Certificates of Origin and Interest,&quot;bused upon declarations made by individual Swedish exporters,would be contrary to the new Swedish Lav/ prohibitingSwedish nationals from making declarations to therepresentatives of foreign powers regarding Swedishexports and imports.      It is hoped that this difficultycan be overcome by arranging for the Certificates of Originto be issued by the various Swedish trade associations,which would obtain them from their members us required and submit them to H.M.Consular Officers for countersignature.6.      The second difficulty arises out of the ShippingAgreement,  which was ready to be initialled and putinto operation when the announcement regarding enemyexports was made.      The Swedish Shipowners Associationwish machinery to be set up to avoid forcing their ships when outward bound, from Sweden into control bases in British waters.      This they regard as very dangerous.Proposals to meet the Swedish shipowners have been agreed with their representative    in London and with the Ministryof Shipping,  and are now being considered by the Admiraltybefore being sent to Sweden for appro/al by the SwedishShipowners Association and by the Swedish Government.There is reason to hope that the proposals willbe acceptable and that it will therefore be possible to bringthe Shipping Agreement into force before the end of this week.Denmark/

7o A large Danish Government.Delegation arrived on the 23rd November.    The first meeting took place atthis Ministry on the following day, when the delegation was welcomed by the Aiinister of Economic warfare.Detailed discussions began on the 27th November.FINLAND8.    The Finnish Trade Delegation which was expected in London at the end of this or the beginning of next month will not now arrive in London before January.BALTIC STATESLatvia9&apos; A Latvian TradLe--Del^3^rt^axra^in December.Lithuania10. Negotiations are proceeding with the LithuanianGovernment for the purchase of 12,000 tons of flax,    TheLithuanians have expressed their wish to sell  to theUnited Kingdom the whole crop of flax and flax seed.ICELAND11. A draft Memorandum embodying proposals to besubmitted by His Majesty&apos;s Government was discussed withthe Icelandic Delegation on the 22nd November.    Therewere a number of points which the Icelandic delegation were unable to accept in the form in which they were presented,  and it was agreed that they should submitcounter-proposals.    These were handed in informally onthe 20th November and will be discussed early nex-t-week.12.  Meanwhile the chairman and Manager of the NationalBank/

Bank of Iceland have been in touch with the export credits Guarantee Department to. explore.the possibilityof a credit to finance British trade with Iceland.NORWAY13. Conversations have taken place between lord Glenconner,  who arrived in Norway on the 20thNovember and Mr0 prebensen of the Norwegian ForeignOffice0      These conversations have been proceedingamicably but there appears to be some divergence ofopinion as to the interpretation of neutrality,lhj.. The German Delegation left Oslo on the 21stNovember.    Before leaving they informed the norwegian government of their disappointment at having failed toreach any definite agreement3    Nevertheless, it appearsthat the Norwegians are very frightened of the Gei*mansand seem reluctant to send a deputation to london at present,      They would prefer to bring negotiationsalmost to finality in Oslo and only send representativeshere for the formal signing,,    Discussions on this pointare still proceedingo13o Meanwhile,  the Norwegian attitude over the delivery of ferro-alloys and aluminium is stillunsatisfactory,  and instructions have been sent to warn the Norwegian Government unofficially that we mayhave to stop further deliveries of raw material unless it is returned to us without restriction as a finishedproduct.l,6o Representations have also been made to theNorwegian Government regarding their refiisal to give guarantees,  in respect of goods passing under contraband control,  to cover no:: -re-export of the*:products of thegoods/

goods and non-release of an equivalent or lesser amountthereof for export following their arrival,BELGIUM17. During the past week the Ministry has beenin close contact with the French, who are negotiating with a Belgian Delegation in paris.      The French andBritish lists of prohibited and partly-prohibitedexports are now almost identical.    The French hoped to sign  v-ie war Trade Agreement on the 27th November.As soon as they have done so, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill take steps to follow suit.NETHERLANDSIS, owing to the refusal of the netherlands government to send any instructions to their delegatesin London,  the latter have now returned to The Hague.Before the negotiations in London were s-uspeaaded fairly-comprehensive lists were agreed upon,    It remains tobe seen what attitude the Netherlands Government willadopt,    it is at least possible that they willrefuse to conclude any Agreement whatever.    In that event we shall be obliged to have recourse to strictrationing,SWITZERLAND19, Negotiations between the French and SwissGovernments for a War Trade Agreement are proceeding in Paris,    His Majesty&apos;s Government are represented by an observer.2o^ Trade discussions have taken place in london with/

o0-   d   -with a Swiss Delegation,    They have hitherto been concerned with pre-war contracts and with the Swissdesire to receive greatly increased quantities ofBritish coal,    The Swiss Government are disappointedat the attitude which His Majesty&apos;s Government were forced to adopt over pre-war contracts.SOVIET RUSSIA21o On the 21st November H.M. Ambassador at moscow received a note from the people1s Commissariatfor Foreign Affairs stating that the icebreaker YERMAKand the steamer KAZAKHSTAN would leave MURMANSK forLENINGRAD on that date and requesting that the Admiraltybe so informed so that the vessels might proceedunhinderedo22c H.M. Ambassaclor was instructed to reply thatHis Majesty5s Government had no difficulty in giving an undertaking as requested in respect of theYERMAK which they regarded as an auxiliary of the Sovietfleet.    They could, only give such an undertaking inrespect of the KAZAKHSTAN if she was habitually employedin the service of the armed, forces of the State,  and theywould, therefore be grateful to learn if that was the case andalso the service in which the vessel was now employed.PORTUGAL23o    His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has reported that thenew draft proposals for a y/ar Trade Agreement have nowbeen presented to the Portuguese Government and appear tohave met,  on preliminary inspection, with a friendlyi y :Meauwhlls,rhe Portuguese Foreign office have/

have expressed a desire to be informed of the positionof our negotiations for War Trade Agreements with Italyand other adjacent neutrals.SPAIN2h. The Delegation report that the high value of thepeseta as fixed by the Spanish Government,  together with high prices in general charged by the Central SellingControl in Spain,  is proving a serious obstacle to theprogress of their negotiations,  though there are grounds for believing that the banking and commercial interestsfavour the devaluation of the peseta.      The disposal of the orange crop is still a matter of great concern to theSpanish Government,  and there is reason to fear that unless a satisfactory solution to this question is found it willbe impossible to arrive at a general trade agreement with spain.ITALY25- The Master of the Rolls has accepted the positionof British Chairman of the Anglo-Italian Joint StandingCommittee in Rome.      Sir -Vilfrid Greene will naturally be unable to spend much time there, but it is hoped thatthe appointment of a personage of his standing will appealto the Italians,  and that his personal contacts with the responsible authorities in London will facilitate the workof the Committee.      He proposes to visit Rome during the christmas vacation.26.    The programme of purchases in Italy,  referred toin former reports,  is now being pursued actively.      It isestimated that the volume of present and prospectivepurchases for account of His Majesty&apos;s Government andin/

O .7*&apos;A rU win the course of ordinary trade may attain a total of 20,000,000.      Arrangements have now been made to buy 10,000tons of hemp with a prospect of more.      Difficulties have arisen in connection with the proposed purchase of 10,000bottles of Italian mercury, but it is now hoped to securenot less than 5?000 bottles from Italy.27.  Signor Gianferrari (paragraph 26 of the Reportof November 13th) has arrived in London.      companies have been formed in Italy to promote Anglo-Italian trade,one of which may be important,  owing to its politicalconnection with high Italian circles through BaronAloisi and others.      A Marchese Giustiniani is visitingLondon on behalf of this concern.      He is apparentlyto be supported by the Italian Embassy, but theposition of the company in relation to Signor Gianferrari&apos;mission is not yet clear.28. A preliminary telegram was sent to His Majesty&apos;charge d&apos;Affaires in Rome on November 25th explaining theprinciples of the proposed embargo on enemy exports andemphasising the desire of His Majesty1s Government to show the utmost consideration compatible with the embargo, forItalian interests.HUNGARY,  BULGARIA.  ROUMANIA,&quot;YUGOSLAVIA29-  A telegram was sent on November 23rd toHis Majesty&apos;s Representatives in these four countriesstating that one or two experts (   &quot;it a purchasingmission) would be sent out shortly to explore the groundwith a view to formulating a long term policy ofobtaining supplies, especially of foods and feedingstuffs.      Subject to the results of this enquiry it was hoped ?-m &quot;^A^nles of the quantities of goods whichthe/

0 Jthe four countries would supply to us and of thegoods,  the delivery of which we would endeavour to facili-tate in return.30i  In return for the goods and services supplied byus,   stipulations would be made with a view to limiting the exports of the four countries to Germany.      Thestipulations contemplated would be:-(l) An absolute guarantee against re-export of empire goods and other sea-borne imports toGermany,  supported,  perhaps, by the granting of facilities to His Majesty&apos;s consular officers to ensure that the guarantees are properly observed.(2) A voluntary rationing of key commodities fromother sources.(3) The limitation of their exports to Germany of&quot;deficiency&quot;  commodities of native production to the minimum possible,  and(h) The production of current statistics of imports and exports with all countries.31.  His Majesty&apos;s Representatives were requested togive their views on these suggestions by telegraph.      Subjectto their agreement in principle they were instructed to approach the Governments to which they are accredited andto enquire whether they were prepared either to instruct their Ministers in London to negotiate some form ofagreement, whether by exchange of notes or otherwise,to cover our requirements in this respect,  or alternativelywhether they would prefer to send delegations to london for the purpose.Yugoslavia/

O A- 1.0 -YUGOSLAVIA32.      Mr. F.H. Nixon, General Manager of the export credits Guarantee Department, has left for Belgradeon a special mission to assist Hia Majesty&apos;s minister in the negotiations concerning the governmental controlof mining in Yugoslavia.     A representative of theMinistry of Supply will also be available in Belgrade.The negotiations will be carried out on the British side in co-operation with the French Mission under M. Alphandwhich is already in Yugoslavia for the purpose of negotiating a r/ar Trade Agreement.      The principal objects of Mr. Nixon&apos;s mission are to prevent the export ofYugoslav minerals to Germany and to secure that certainquantities of them are made available for Franco-british requirements.FAR EAST33- The whole question of contraband control in the far East is now under consideration by the various departments concerned.P: :pt3h-  Efforts are now being made to tighten up theexport licensing system in Egypt.UNITED STATES AND SOUTH AMERICA35.    The announcement that HAM.  Embassy in washington will begin on December 1st the issue ofUavicerts to most neutral countries in Europe was onthe whole well received by the American Press.      arrangements are also making good progress for starting the system in/

6 Jin Argentine, Brazil and Uruguay;    and it is hopedthat if the necessary ifar Trade lists can be distributed in time,  the system will start simul-taneously in all three countries on December 12th.36. Meanwhile,  the possibility of making arrangements with certain big groups of exporters in the New Worldunder which their trade would be conducted in a mannersatisfactory to us and subject to the necessary guarantees,is being further explored, and though no agreements have yet been made,  prospects in certain cases are promising.Contraband Control.377- During the week ending 25th November,  13k newcases of ships were dealt v/ith and 57 previous cases,  inregard to whose cargoes or items thereof enquiries hadbeen completed, were disposed of.38.  In only one case was an entire cargo seized whilstin 97 cases entire cargoes were released,  either on firstconsideration or after enquiries.39. The system under which advance copies of manifestsof cargoes are received and considered before the shipsarrival at ports in this country resulted, during the week under review,  in 31 cases being so dealt with and in 20cases of the ships concerne&apos; being released by theCommittee subject merely to the formal checking of theoriginal manifests on their arrival at the Control,Bases.      In addition to these immediate releases,  in 27 other cases the Committee&apos;s decision to release was given within5 days or less of the arrival of ships at the Control bases.
