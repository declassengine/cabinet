The Yugoslavs are determined to secure armaments of which they are badly in need,in exchange for their mineral output and our efforts are being directed primarily to limiting Yugoslav exports of mineralores to Germany to pre-war quantities against delivery ofarmaments and to securing copper and lead supplies for theFrench.      With a view to achieving these aims,   the french delegation are working on a scheme for furnishing military supplies up to a value of 250 - 300 million Frs.   and thepossihilities of our providing aeroplane and aviation supplies and meeting Yugoslav needs in raw materials and certain commodities are being examined.19.

Our Delegation in Madrid report that the Spanish authori-ties have agreed to subsidise their exports pending furtherconsideration of the question of the Spanish price level whichmay involve the devaluation of the peseta.

Mr.  Playfair is returning to London to discuss theterms of a Clearing Agreement to be proposed to  the SpanishGovernment.2k-       The question of shipping is still causing serious diffi-culty to our negotiations and H.M.  /mbassador has asked whether&apos;the Ministry of Shipping would be prepared to send a represen-tative to Madrid.      This is under consideration.25.        The Ministry of Supply are considering purchasing aconsiderable quantity of guns and shells from Spain and proposesending a representative to that country to enquire into thequestion.I T A L Y26.        A new effort is being made to  solve  jointly the problemspresented by (a)  Italy&apos;s coal requirements from other sourcesif she is deprived of sea-borne supplies from Germany inconsequence of the  recent embargo on enemy exports and (b)  theneed of a satisfactory basis for the new clearing arrangements with Italy which have been under discussion for several weeks.It is now proposed to enforce the embargo on German coal    butto offer to increase  the quantities of Bri tish coal which ithad been intended to make available for export to Italy bythe approximate equivalent of the supplies which that countrylfdght have expected to receive by sea from Germany but forthe embargo./

the embargo.      On the other hand it is proposed to undertakethat British purchases in Italy of all kinds,  including air-craft and armaments,  shall not fall short of a value of 20,000,000,   to which must be added from  5,000,000 to 6,000,000 for freights to be paid to Italian ships under thearrangements mentioned in the last report.      H. M.  ambassador in Rome has been informed of these new proposals and, whileforeseeing certain difficulties,   considers that they afford abasis of negotiation with the  Italians.      Mr.  Rodd of theMinistry of Economic Warfare left for Rome on December 10th toassist Sir Percy Loraine in following the matter up.27.        Very strong expression has again been given in highquarters in Rome to Italian grievances over the delays entailedin Italian shipping by British control measures.      A scheme hasnow been devised for improving the position in the   /esternMediterranean and inter alia co-ordinating the  action of theBritish and French authorities concerned.      This scheme hasbeen communicated, to ELM.   Ambassador in Rome and will,  it ishoped,  strengthen his hand in discussion with the italian authorities,S V/ I T Z E R L A K D28.        The negotiations between the French and Swiss Dele-gations in Paris have been resumed..      The greatest obstacles to agreement hitherto have been the Swiss claim to exportwithout restriction goods manufactured from imported materials,and the objection taken by the Swiss to a distinction being drawn between &quot;good&quot;  and &quot;bad&quot; neutrals.      The SwissDelegation have now been given the text of the Belgianagreement to study, with a view to its adaptation to the economy of Switzerland-IIP AJ29.        The Japanese Government have reacted strongly to theMeasures taken by His Matiesty!s Government to prevent theexport/

9 - ?o tifexport of goods from Germany.      On the 27th November theJapanese Ambassador lodged a vigorous protest.      On the hthDecember this protest was followed up by a further note putting forward three concrete requests:(1) that as regards materials and machines for the useof the Japanese Government,  including those for factoriesunder Government control, and also certain special articlessuch as potassium, His Majesty&apos;s Government should not inter-fere with Japanese imports from Germany even in the case of contracts made after the 27th November,  1939.(2) that even when goods are not for Government use in japan,  the import into Japan of goods of German origin shouldnot be prevented,   even v/hen they are carried by neutral vessels clearing from neutral ports after the date (DecemberUth) stipulated in the Order-in-Council,  provided that the contracts were made prior to  the date of the  issue of theOrder-in-Council,   and especially when part payment had beenmade before that date.(3)  that pending a decision on (1)  and (2),  the stipulated-lations of the Order-in-Council  should not be applied to out-going cargoes carried by Japanese vessels clearing from neutral ports in Europe before the 1st January,   1940.30.       Meanwhile  the whole issue had become one of extreme urgency and practical importance,  owing to the fact thatcertain Japanese vessels were known to be loading German goodsat Rotterdam.      The s.s.   &quot;Sanyo Maru&quot; was reported toSir R.  Craigie by the Japanese Ministry for Foreign affairs as being due  to sail about December 10th.      Information wasalso received that this vessel was to carry a great deal ofGerman cargo,  which was to be sent in the name of the JapaneseGovernment.31.        The latest information received in the Ministry (onDecember/

9 ^ft ODecember 11th)  shows that the  s.s.  &quot;Sanyo Maru&quot; has not yetstarted from Rotterdam, and that the Japanese Government seemanxious to do what they can to prevent an incident,   and willprobably arrange for full details of her cargo to he communi-cated in advance to the Ministry,   in order that an understandingon the subject may he reached before the vessel reaches theBritish Contraband Control.UYPT32.       The decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to supportthe Egyptian cotton market by purchase led to haggling on thepart of the Egyptian Government over the purchase price.      a concession v/as granted, hut the Egyptian Government wouldappear to have  stolen our thunder by a suppression of thefacts and an appropriation of the kudos.afghanistan and I R A N_33-       The Afghan and Iranian Governments have expressed some concern with regard to the measures taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to stop German exports.      They are anxiousregarding their prospects of receiving goods already orderedin Germany.CONTRABAND CONTROL3U.        During the week ending 9th December 121   new cases ofships were dealt with and 1+8 previous cases,  in regard th whose cargoes or items thereof enquiries had been completed,were disposed of.35-       In three cases,  an entire cargo was seized, whilst in73 cases entire cargoes were released,  either on firstconsideration or after enquiries.36.       The system under which advance copies of manifests of cargoes are received and considered before the ships&apos;  arrival at ports in this country resulted,  during the week under review,in 25 cases being so dealt with,   and in 19 cases of the shipsconcerned/
