MINISTRY OF FOODREPORT ON THE FOOD SUPPLY position.    Stocks of Foodstuffs - general note-,The stock position of the main foodstuffs is shown inthe Appendix.      For each main commodity figures are given of thestock, and the estimated equivalent in weeks&apos;  supply on the basisof normal peace-time consumption, at mid-September, mid-october and mid-November.It will be seen that the deterioration of the stock position of cereals and sugar has continued during the period underreview.     In both cases the level of stocks has now fallen too lowfor the efficient working of the processing industries.     Still moreare the stocks short of what can be regarded as an adequate reserve for unforeseeable contingencies in war,,      This process ofdeterioration has not yet come to an end.At the outset of the war,  delays in arrivals were to beexpected.     The longer voyage time resulting from the convoy system,and the absence of sufficient neutral tonnage to offset theconsignment reduction of effective shipping space have, however,produced a shortage of tonnage which still persists.      Owing tothe diminution of imports, resort has been made to the home crop toan extent far exceeding the normal, with the result that a heavierburden must fall on import programmes during the late spring andthe summer of 19h0 for the purpose of maintaining supplies of flourand refined sugar for current consumption.      Over and above this,there is the task of rebuilding the stock position to the levelconsistent with national security.This subject is fully discussed in a paper which has just been submitted to the War Cabinet from the Committee on Food Policy.In the case of cereals, the present objective is to makepurchases in Canada to the full extent to which shipping facilities are available.      In the case of sugar, supplies have been purchaseda^d are ready for shipment in Empire countries, but sufficienttonnage is not available to lift them, and the Ministry are seeking authority to make purchases from the nearest foreign sources ofCuba and San Domingo.

The situation in regard to cereals and sugar is dealtwith in more detail in sections 2 and 3 of this Report,Shipping difficulties are also affecting the imports ofthe raw materials for edible oils0     These commodities are dealtwith in section k of this Report,,In the case of meat, bacon and dairy produce, the supply position has not materially changedo     Additions have been made tothe small reserves in cold storage.      Difficulty has arisen inregard to the prices to be paid in future to oversea suppliers ofbacon and butter, and uncertainty is felt in regard to thecontinuance of these supplies from North European countries.,     these commodities are dealt with in more detail in section 5 of this Report,2.   CerealsBThe total amount of wheat used for human and animalconsumption from mid-October to mid-November is estimated at600,000 tons or 12 per cento above normal,      Imports of wheat and flour (in terms of wheat) were only 18U,000 tons as compared with normal imports of over hOO,000 tons.      Total stocks, including those on farms, declined from 2.3 million tons on the 21st October to1.9 million tons on the 18th November, a fall of 18 per cent-, and became sufficient for only 16-g- weeks&apos;  supply on the assumption thatthe whole of the stock is available for human consumption, or 12weeks&apos;  supply allowing consumption by livestock at the same rate as during the month under review.      It is anticipated that during theperiod mid-November to the end of December the position will improvesomewhat as a result of anticipated imports of 660,000 tons and theoperation of the Home Grown Wheat Control Order as from the1st December, under which two-thirds of the home crop marketedshould be available for human consumption?      This measure shouldproduce about 100,000 tons of domestic wheat per month for humanuse during the next four months.It should be borne in mind that a minimum working stockQf wheat and flour in port granaries and mills is required to ensurecontinuity of operations.      For this purpose, and as the minimumstock position on grounds of security, it is considered that stocks2o

of 1,250,000 tons of wheat, and 300,000 tons of flour arenecessarjT-, and that it should be a definite objective to restorestocks to these levels as quickly as possible.     For the period between March, when a great part of the home crop will be exhausted, and the next harvest, this reserve can scarcely beregarded as excessivei      It is estimated that in order to ensurethat this position is achieved by the end of March, 19I4O, importsof wheat during the first three months of that year should average600,000 tons per month, or 100,000 tons per month in excess of consumption requirements of imported wheat.     Imports on this scale are not in sight.At the present time as much wheat is being purchased from Canada as can be shipped.     Application has been made to theMinistry of Shipping for a minimum of 125,000 tons of shippingper week for North Atlantic ports until stocks reach a satisfactorylevel.The depletion of stocks in the port granaries, which nowamount to only about 6 weeks&apos;  supply, is making it difficult tomaintain an even distribution of wheat to mills.      Some mills inthe south-east of England and also in the west of Scotland havealready been closed from time to time, owing to difficulty inobtaining supplies.      It is likely that a further reduction of stocks would cause shortages of flour in some parts of thecountry, and difficulty would arise, particularly in London, if for any prolonged period ships could not be brought into east coast ports, or if convoys were appreciably delayed.Imports of maize and barley amounted to 1U5,000 tonsbetween mid-October and mid-November, against normal imports ofabout 350,000 tons.      Stocks were already extremely low and wheathas been used on a considerable scale for animal feeding.     Thisis no doubt the main cause of the abnormally high consumption ofwheat.      In consequence of the shortage of supplies of feeding-stuffs a considerable number of livestock have been slaughtered.The stock of barley on farms has been reduced from about 700,000to 500,000 tons, mainly as a result of heavy purchases by brewers.3.

An Inter-departraental Committee has presented, a report on the praticability of diverting some part of the stocks of cereals heldor supplies used by brewers and distillers for use as feeding-stuffs.Oats, on the other hand, have scarcely begun to leave the farms, and there is a serious shortage for the manufacture ofoatmeal.      Proposals for bringing oats under control are at present under consideration.3* Sugar.The total consumption of sugar during the four weeks ended 19th November was 185,000 tons (refined) or nearly 20 per cent,above normal.      Imports of sugar (in terms of refined) were 67,000tons as compared with normal imports of about 145,000 tons.     total stocks, in terms of refined, declined from 725,000 tons on21st October to 607,000 tons on 19th November.     The stocks on thelatter date were made up as follows:-Situation of Stocks Refineries and beet sugar factories and depots Wholesalers and re-tailers (estimated) Estimated product-tion from balance of home crop	Thousand Tons			Raw	Refined	Total in terms of refined	175 145	111 80 117	273 80 25kTotal Stocks	320	308	607 LThese stocks represent nearly 15 weeks&apos;  supply at thenormal rate of consumption, but only 12 weeks&apos;  supply at the present rate of consumption.The Ministry has asked consumers to ration themselvesvoluntarily to 1  lb. per head per Week,,      On this basis and includingthe manufacturing requirements, the consumption would be 162,000 tonsof refined sugar per month.

ICOIt is considered that the minimum working stock in thehands of distributors and refiners, in order to ensure continuity of operations, should be 300,000 tons of raw and 100,000 tons of white sugar.      The present low level of stocks of raw sugar at therefineries produces a situation where the industry is working fromhand to mouth.      Refiners are relying for supplies on home-grownsugar moved from the beet factories to the port refineries, a process which is costly and cannot long be maintained.      It isconsidered that a further reserve should be carried in the countryin war conditions, over and above the working stock of h00,000 tons.It is suggested that every endeavour should be made to reach atotal minimum stock of 650,000 tons as rapidly as possible.The present stocks - 607,000 tons on the 19th November -are still decreasing.      Looking to the position from the19th November up to the end of December, arrivals (in terms ofrefined)  are estimated at 1 AO,000 tons against requirements of280,000 tons.      In January, arrivals are estimated at 95,000 tonsagainst requirements of 215,000 tons.      In the result stocks (interms of refined)  at the end of January are likely to be reducedto less than 350,000 tons.     The home-grown production will then have ended.      It will have been used at an abnormally high rate.The Ministry made contracts at the outset of the war forthe purchase of the exportable surplus of Empire Sugar Producersup to August 19A0, in amount estimated at 760,000 tons of raw sugar.This total has lately been reduced to 6h0,000 tons owing to badgrowing conditions in the British West Indies.      The shipment ofthese Empire supplies has, however, been partially held up by shortage of tonnage.     At the present time, tonnage falls short of requirements for the transport of stocks ready for shipment by about260,000 tons.      Against a balance of 122,000 tons of Queenslandsugar awaiting shipment, it is unlikely that more than 10 to 20,000tons can be shipped in time to reach this country before the end ofFebruary,     Against a balance of 49,000 tons of Natal sugar awaitingshipment it is unlikely that more than 20,000 tons can be shippedfor arrival by the end of February,

4 f*- *;The Ministry is accordingly seeking authority to makeimmediate purchases from the nearest foreign sources of Cuba andSan Domingo.      In order to build up a total minimum stock of 650,000!tons by the end of June, 1940s, imports of 550,000 tons would berequired from these countries. This figure is based on a consumption0f 1 lb. per head.     There appears to be little prospect of building up stocks to the level of 650,000 tons before the end of June, 19h0.Proposals for rationing sugar from 8th January, 19UC arebeing submitted to the War Cabinet from the Committee on Pood Policy.If.   Oils and Pats.The stocks of whale oil are sufficient for more than a full year&apos;s supply at the current rate of use.      Negotiations are still proceeding with the Japanese whaling interests for the purchase oftheir catch next spring;    negotiations have not yet begun withNorwegian interests.Stocks of oilseeds and nuts have been maintained during theperiod under review at about one month&apos;s current consumptionrequirements, which is about 18 per cent,  above normal.      These rawmaterials are in ample supply in different parts of the world, butarrivals of some of them in this country are being held up by shipping difficulties.     Lack of freight has slowed down shipments ofcotton seed from Egypt, and ground nuts from India.      The position inregard to ground nuts should improve shortly when the West Africancrops become available for shipment.The future supply position of linseed oil is also precarious.The Argentine is the principal present source of supply, but freightcan only be obtained at the expense of cereal cargoes.The reasonable stock position of oilseeds in normal times isgenerally taken as six weeks&apos;  supply.      By the end of December thePosition should be satisfactory for copra and palm kernels, but stocksbe down to 3i weeks   cover for the seeds producing liquid oils,ftless stocks of these liquid oils show considerable improvement in the New Year, it will be impossible to maintain the existing scale of distribution of margarine and compound lard.

i y ^5.   Other Commodities.In the case of meat, bacon and butter, the position hasbeen generally maintained on the basis of a distribution considerably below the normal.      Some increase has been made in the level of stocks, though stocks are necessarily small for these goods whichnormally pass rapidly into consumption.     The object of building upsmall reserves is to provide against irregular arrivals in future.As regards meat, arrivals of imported meat were regular and were little short of normal.      Owing particularly to the demandsof the Services and the allocations to the reserve, distributionhas been below 50 per cent, of the normal, but has recently been increased to that proportion.      Stocks rose to the equivalent ofabout 3-g- weeks1  supply on the basis of normal consumption of imported meat, and these are regarded as a sufficient reserve.      It isanticipated that supplies on the present scale will continue.The estimated supply of home-killed meat has been abovethe normal.     While the slaughter of livestock to meet demand shoulddecline to normal as larger supplies of imported meat are madeavailable for distribution, the maintenance of the number of livestock is dependent on the supplies of feeding-stuffs.As regards bacon, distribution to retailers has been about50 per cent,  of the normal.      Stocks in cold stores rose to 17,000tons, the equivalent of just over two weeks1  supply on the rationbasis.     It is considered that a total reserve of 32,000 tons, inthe hands of traders, factories and cold stores, is desirable;    theexisting stocks are 8,000 tons short of this figure.The prospects of future supplies of bacon from Denmarkare uncertain.     Apart from the shipping position in the North Sea,it is possible that the decrease in the supply and increase in theprice of feeding-stuffs will lead Denmark to reduce its dependence on the export of bacon.      The Danish Delegation now in England are seeking increases of prices.     Canadian bacon has been coming forward in relatively large quantities.      Negotiations for a long term contract which have been held up for a long time on the question of price are now nearing completion.      Supplies from the Home Market,and7.

to?from Northern Ireland and Eire have continued to decline owing tothe evasion of the Pigs Prices Order and the diversion of pigs topork and manufactured foods.      It is estimated that production ofhome &quot;bacon has declined since the outbreak of war from 2,h00 tons aweek to 1,200 tons a week.Distribution of bacon on the ration basis is of coursedependent on the maintenance of Danish supplies which are of theorder of 17,500 tons a month.      It is possible, that if increases of price are conceded on Canadian or Danish supplies, leading to increases of retail price, the demand for bacon in the country willdiminish, resort being had to alternative foods,.As regards butter, distribution to retailers has beenslightly above 50 per cent,  of the normal.      Stocks have risen to28,000 tons, the equivalent of hi weeks&apos;  supply on the ration basis.It is considered that a minimum reserve of 30,000 tons should bemaintained.      If the present programmes are fulfilled this should beachieved in the latter half of December.      This estimate is of coursedependent on the maintenance of supplies from Denmark, Holland and sweden,The long-term outlook for butter is not favourable.      It islikely that imports from European countries will tend to fall owing tothe feeding-stuffs position and currency conditions.      On present information, supplies from the Southern Hemisphere will be reduced inthe late spring and early summer of 19h0 owing to seasonal causes.The normal course is for a greater proportionate shipment to takePlace in the early part of the season.Supplies of cheese should be sufficient for normal requirements during the next three months.      Stocks fell by 12 percent, during the period under review;    they are now sufficient for about 6 weeks.      Shipments next spring and summer are likely to be relatively small.      It is not considered possible to build up asufficient reserve in order to provide against this contingency.

Reference has already been made to the immediate shipping position in relation to the stocks and supplies of particular commodities.On a longer view,  taking the situation over the first year of the war, the Ministry of Shipping estimate that the total shipping space which can be allotted for food imports will be 19.8 million tons,against the normal import figure of 22 million tons a year.      The foodimport programme is being examined with a view to effecting this reduction.The refrigerated tonnage position is satisfactory at present,but the available capacity is estimated to be barely sufficient forthe peak load on refrigerated tonnage which arises in the first sixmonths of each years     There is little margin for losses or unexpecteddelays.As regards neutral shipping, 31 neutral vessels, with a totalcarrying capacity of 165,000 tons, have recently been &quot;fixed&quot;, orengaged for a single voyage, following the increase of freight ratesapproved by the Ministry of Shipping.      The majority of these ships are bringing grain from the Plate and Roumania.      In addition 9 ships,with a total capacity of about 67,000 tons, which have been taken bythe Ministry of Shipping on time charter, have been allotted forhomeward voyages with grain from the Plate and North America.Considerable neutral tonnage is still available in the Plate and Par3ast, but there is keen competition,  in addition to some disinclinationon the part of neutrals to run in the danger zones, and current ratestend to be higher than those officially approved.      It is hoped that further neutral tonnage will be secured, while the delay occasioned byarming of British ships is non-recurrent and is rapidly diminishing.Pitish tonnage is being increasingly directed to essential routes, a droadly speaking, the tonnage  position has become a little easier duringth-e month under review,(*   rices.Owing to the maintenance of prices at levels insufficient topresent replacement costs, losses are being incurred on the salenumber of foodstuffs.     A number of increases in selling prices arejnerefore inevitable if the present losses are to be terminated.9.

Bread and Flour.Since the outbreak of war the average f.o.b. prices of imported wheat have risen by about 2/- per quarter, and increasedfreights and insurance have added a further 2/6d.     In addition the necessity for shipping from the nearest source (Canada) hasdisturbed the pre-war proportions of the total wheat supply, andmillers&apos; grist now consists of 50 per cent. Canadian wheat, themost expensive type, as compared with 15 per cent, last August.As a result of these various factors, the actual average cost ofwheat has risen since August by 8/- per quarter.     It is estimatedthat, if the prices of flour and bread are maintained at theirpresent level and millers are allowed to retain their pre-warprofits, a Government subsidy of  1h millions a year would berequired.In order to cover the present replacement cost of wheat and to give the millers their pre-war profits the price of flourwould have to rise to nearly 30/- per sack from the present priceof 22/-.     This increase would be just sufficient to raise theprice of bread under the scale now in operation in London, and overabout one half of the area of the United Kingdom, to 9d. per h, lb.loaf.     But since the price of bread under this scale moves upwardor downward by  d. per h lb. loaf for every rise or fall of 1+/-per sack in the price of flour, the price of flour could then befurther increased to 32/- without involving a further increase inthe price of bread and this would leave some margin to meet thefurther increase in freight rates which appears imminent,,The position is therefore that, if costs are to be met,the price of flour should be raised by 10/- to 32/- per sack (or35/6d, inclusive of quota payments) and the price of bread by 1 d.to 9d. per U lb. loaf.Imported Meat.Imported Meat is at present being sold by the Ministry ofFood at prices which involve an estimated loss of about  50,000 aweek.     If prices were raised sufficiently to cover costs therewould be an increase of 1d. per lb.  on the present wholesale10.

prices of imported beef, mutton and pork, and 1^-d. per lb. on thatof imported lamb.Home-produced Meat.The prices to be paid for fatstock on the commencementof full control were announced on 11th November&quot; but owing to the postponement of the scheme these will require amendment early inthe New Year to take account of the seasonal rise in prices of cattle and sheep.     These changes may be estimated to increase the retail price of beef by 0.6d. per lb., and that of mutton by 2fd,per lb. (the latter increase being due to the decision to pay anaverage price of 1/- per lb. over the year for sheep).The price of home-produced bacon will also be affectedby the revision, which is already due, of the present prices of animal feeding-stuffs.      Assuming that the prices paid for pigscontinue to be regulated by a formula similar to that now inoperation, the retail price of home-produced bacon might beexpected to rise by 2d. - 3d. per lb., and an increase in pricesof roughly similar proportions on imported supplies will benecessary if the present losses, which amount to about  200,000to date, are to be terminated.Milk.Milk, like livestock, will be affected by any revision ofthe prices of animal feeding-stuffs and the proposed new scalewould justify an increase of 1^-d. per gallon in the pool price.     Afurther increase is, however, being asked for by the Milk MarketingBoard to cover other items of increased costs, while theDistributors have also put forward claims for increased margins.These further claims are at present under consideration.     Theincrease in retail prices is estimated provisionally at 1d. perquart.Butter and Cheese.Some increase in prices is likely of the order of 1 d. per lb.. for butter and ^d, per lb. for cheese.11 o

PuPGPT ON FOOD PRODUCTION 3(By the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in xconjunction with the Secretary of State for Scotland)5&apos;..til, ffgve.::bervPlouyhJ.n:v..up CampaignOb.iectiye.,( Increase: in arable acreapre expected by the spring-of;.1 diOg -caea^aaeod. wLf n. 1959):England and V ales, 1,500,000 acres;    Scotland, 260,000;   NorthernIreland, 25c,000;    total epproximately 2,000,000.     TMs total includes some300,000 acres which, under the Agricultural Development Act, would probably have been added to the arable acreage, even if no additional war-time task had had been imposed on farmers.App.licati.ons for ploughing; up,. grant Jxc^J^Jx^T- ?5LtL -England a.nd V-elos, 635,000 acres;    Scotland, l.&apos;i0,000;    NorthernIreland, approximately 100,000;    total, approximately 910,000.      This totalincludes 250,000 acres in respect 01 which application for grant was madeprior to the outbreak of war.It does not. follow that all the acreage for which grant has been applied has yet been ploughed up.     But,  on the other hand, in several countiesthe acreage for which provisional promises from farmers have teen received bythe County Committees exceeds that for which they have applied for grant:ana at &quot;the same time there may be a small acreage which will be ploughed upthough net eligible for grant.In the circumstances it is still too early to estimate what will bethe dearee of ultimate success of the ploughing up campaign.      In some countiesa full response by farmers is confidently expected:    but other counties arelegging behind,  and on the basis of present conditions it seems that they maynot fulfil their allocations.     further, it is known that although only a relatively small part of the programme could be accomplished in the autumn, itis nevertheless behind schedule on the whole.     There are three main reasons -unfavourable weather conditions, farmers&apos; uncertainties regarding prices,  andlocal shortage of machinery, labour and credit.V:eathcr conditions have hindered ploughing up and made it difficultto sow wheat during the autumn.      Consequently a large part of the ploughing upprogramme is retarded and seme of the sowing programme is being postponed untilthe spring.Price uncertainties have related chiefly to crop prices for the 1940

har&quot;2S&apos;k,.     Sugar-b-yst contract prices have been announced, but farmers areinsufficiently assured with regard to the prices of potatoes, wheat and oats.The raising of wheat and oats prices of the 1939 crops has,  however, done something to increase confidence, but particularly in Scotland uncertainty over potatopr^ces remains an important limiting factor,  and delay in announcing the proposedguaranteed prices for 1940 is having an unsettling effect.Local OrgsnizationThe work of &quot; ar Agricultural Executive Committees has been proceedingfor the most part smoothly and efficiently in the surveying of farms,  securing ofquotas of land to be ploughed up, serving ploughing up orders, and certifyingapplications for ploughing up grant.      In respect of 1,350 acres in England andWales, the Committees have taken possession of the land or terminated existingtenancies, with a view to securing more effective cultivation of neglected land.No similar action has yet been taken in Scotland, though a few cases are underconsideration.Man-P-owerUnder peace-time conditions the summer and autumn labour shortage wouldprobably be giving way to a small surplus, but ploughing up requirements and the calling up of 10,000 workers for military service have altered the position,  andthere is some shortage of labour, particularly in arable districts.      Labour forthreshing is particularly scarce.     The loss of agricultural workers to Governmentcontractors paying higher wages still continues.As a result of increases in statutory minimum wages already authorised orpending, the average minimum wage for ordinary male adults will increase from34/9d. on September 1st to 36/ll-gd. in January.     The increase has not kept pace with the rise in the cost of living, and it is improbable that it will have any appreciable effect in remedying the labour shortage, which is likely to becomesteadily worse from January next.There is not much suitable work for the Women&apos;s Land Army in the winter,and placements with farmers (rather more than 2,000 to date) have been smaller than the number completing training.     Farmers&apos; demand is expected to increase considerably in the spring, however, but it is doubtful how far the VV,L.A. can meetnext summer&apos;s demand for seasonal labour,  --.s most of the women are looking forre ular employment.

Machinery and ImplementsLack of machinery and implements (especially ploughs) has been oneof the factors holding up autumn ploughing and cultivations, hut the position has become temporarily eased by the seasonal decline in land operations andthe increase in supplies coming forward from home sources and from north america.     Although it has been possible to satisfy the requirements of theCounty Committees (who arrange to have the work done for farmers in need ofsuch assistance) farmers&apos; own demands are not yet satisfied.     Even with much increased rates of output - e.g. the Ford Company&apos;s output of tractors hasdoubled compared with a year earlier - home manufacturers of tractors andploughs are booked up with orders until at least the end of the year.Seeds and FertilisersFarmers&apos; seods requirements are being adequately met, but there is some danger of a shortage of cereal seed in the spring, owing to farmers usingtoo much of the crop for feeding.     This question is receiving consideration.Arrangements are being made to secure sufficient supplies of seed potatoes and various kinds of imported seed.     The fertiliser position is on the wholesatisfactory.     French supplies of potash are becoming available in substitution for German in larger quantities than was expected.     There is anample supply of sulphate of ammonia and super-phosphate, and farmers are beingurged to buy more of the former.     Supplies of rock phosphate, however, areshort, and so are organic fertilisers such as bone-meal - in both cases owingto lack of shipping space - but these scarce fertilisers are of subsidiaryimportance.LivestockSerious difficulties have arisen during the month of November withregard to the sale of livestock, which have already been referred to the WarCabinet.      The decision to defer for a considerable period the introduction of meat rationing - and with it, as they supposed, a similar postponement of an assured market for their stock - led to grave apprehension on the part of producers who began to unload their animals on the market much in excess of demand.

1 9JL xIn order to stem the tide the Government announced on 11th november that the system of partial control by maximum prices would be brought to anend and that as from an early date all fat stock would be purchased by theMinistry of Pood on the basis of an agreed initial scale of prices to operate,in general, until the end of the current year.The Minister of Pood subsequently found it necessary to modify hisarrangements for instituting State purchase of livestock and these changes have made it impossible to introduce the new system until mid-January next.In the meantime j since partial control through the Maximum Prices Order had become more and more ineffective and discredited, it has been decided and announced that, partly in order to cope with the special prices normallyruling for the Christmas trade, all control will be relaxed on and after4th December until the new system of full control can be instituted.     As aresult of this decision it will be necessary to re-negotiate with the farmers&apos;representatives a revised scale of prices to operate from mid-January, whichwill take into account the normal upward trend in the spring and also any increase in costs of production arising from the proposed revision of the feeding Stuffs (Maximum Prices) Order and the increase in wages that isoccurring.In making these revisions it is considered that the prospectivefood supply situation, coupled with the undoubted difficulties experienced by farmers in maintaining their output of livestock and livestock products whilehaving to use unfamiliar and less economic methods of feeding, renders it essential to introduce an incentive element into any new scale of pricesproposed.     Unless adequate levels of prices are assured to farmers over aconsiderable period, there is a grave danger that the very serious shortage inthe supply of essential feeding stuffs during the next four months may lead topremature slaughter of all kinds of stock, including dairy and breedinganimals which would not only endanger the milk supply, but also deplete ourvaluable living reserve of meat.As regards sheep there is serious dissatisfaction amongst hill sheepfarmers in Scotland owing to the very bad conditions prevailing in 1939 as

There must be assumed to be a real danger of a decline in the sheep population in Scotland.FdOfijStuffsMany farmers had aoeumulated substantial stocks of feeling stuffson farms prior to the var.; but these have been used up and farmers are nowexperiencing the full effect of the severe reduction in imports of feedingstuffs that has occurred since the outbreak: of war arid which must apparentlycontinue at least ion til March siocct , croing to the diversion of much of theavailable tonnage to rebuilding the wheat reserve ana cp the transport ofmunitions and other&apos; essential war materials.     Little immediate relief canbe obtained from home-grown supplies.      From 1st December not more than one-third of the remainder&quot; of the home wheat crop corning on to the market may be sold for feeding, other than the quantity used for seed and this is substantially less than the normal proportion.     Practically the whole of thebarley crop will be required for brewing and distilling (unless there is some restriction of these industries, a question now under1 examination by an inter-Departmental Committee) and for seed.      Oats are being largely utilisedon the farms on which they are grown or to meet the appreciable increase inoatmeal milling and. for seed.      The 1939 hay crop was below average and stocks remaining from the previous year were very small-No material improvement in home-grown, supplies can, of course, beexpected before next autumn, and even this improvement will not be fullyachieved unless adecuate inducements are offered to farmers to put forth themaximum effort to increase the production of arable crops, especially of feeding stuffs, in order to supplement the shortage of imports of suchfeeding stuffs that must be expected to continue to a greater or less degree.This aspect of the matter is now under consideration, inter alia, by the newMinisterial Sub-Co committee of the Home Policy Committee.The .Var Cabinet has already decided, and an announcement was madeto this effect on 22nd November, that in view of the serious shortage inimported feeding stuffs some discrimination must be exercised as betv/een

different classes of livestock in order to carry out the Government*policy of maintaining, as far as possible, the production of milk, fat cattle and sheep, and requiring any deficiency in feeding stuffs to be borne byproducers of pigs and poultry.     Further examination of the measures necessary to implement this policy has been undertaken and is still continuing, but it already seoms clear that some method of rationing feedingstuffs will be needed in order to secure as far as practicable the diversionfrom pigs and poultry of some part of the feeding stuffs at present used by those classes of stock, to the maintenance of the cattle and sheep population.Proposals for rationing will be submitted as soon as this examination hasbeen completed.Cottage Pig Keeping, etc.The inevitable reduction in our pig population can be mitigated byan increase in pig keeping in ones cr twos by cottagers, allotment holdersetc. who will feed them mainly on household and garden waste.     Steps arebeing taken to revive the Village Pig Club movement of the last war and inother ways to increase non-farm pig keeping.      The Ministry is alsoinitiating a campaign for an increase in poultry keeping by householders andfarmers who can feed them on waste material.Animal HealthThere have been four outbreaks of foot and mouth disease inNovember:    this is not a large number.     The carcases of stock slaughtered arebeing salvaged for human consumption wherever possible.      The number ofoutbreaks of swine fever has decreased from 630 in October to 373.Northern IrelandProgress under the ploughing up campaign has been satisfactory,having regard to the shortage of implements which has prevailed until recently.The feeding stuffs position, however, has been particularly serious inNorthern Ireland since the relatively large pig and poultry population means a large demand for grains and meals, which have been particularly scarce.
