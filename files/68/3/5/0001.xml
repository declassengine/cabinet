INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,j,     The National Joint Advisory Council to advise on matters of common interest to employers and workers held its first meeting on 1st November under my Chairmanship.     The subjects dealt with included the Schedule of reserved occupations, the Control of Employment Act, the possibility of reducing the duration of the &quot;black-out&quot; period, the cost of living index figure, and thewar time regulation of wages.     The discussion on the last of these subjectsreflected the intense interest of both employers and v/orkers in the questionof the relations between wages, cost of living, price stabilisation and nationalfinance, and the discussion is to be continued at a further meeting on 6th December.2.     There are no signs suggestive of serious industrial trouble in the nearfuture, and the spirit of co-operation remains strong.     Ho tra.de disputes ofimportance have occurred, but there was an unofficial stoppage affecting fourteenhundred workpeople in an important iron and steel works in Scotland.     The TradeUnion and the employers Organisation concerned took prompt and effective actionto prevent the trouble from spreading and to ensure that the difficulty whichwas the cause of the stoppage was dealt with in a constitutional manner.3.     The adjustment of wages to meet the rise in the cost of living has been proceeding smoothly by negotiation.     In about a dozen of the Trades which havestatutory minimum rates of wages under the Trade Board system the question ofincreasing minimum rates has been raised and will be dealt with by the appropriateBoards.      Two of them have already made agreed proposals.4.     The considerable cessation of private building work is causing some disquietin the building industry and its ancillary trades.     It is noteworthy that in only one instance was there failure to reach joint agreement on a wagesclaim viz. in the clay industries, (brick making, etc.).5.     There is evidence of a considerable increase in Trade Union membership,Particularly among women.     This is due, not so much to special efforts made by trade Unions to improve organisation, as to a spontaneous movement whichrecognises the need for solidarity in present circumstances.s*    While the &quot;black-out&quot; remains a factor tending to create difficulties,there have been no developments in the latest period suggestive of any realtrouble on this account.

ft i-mzwYiim and wm&amp;wnmM!&apos;, * -IUnemployment: Figures.7,     Since the last Report the results of the monthly Live Register counthave been announced.     A net increase of 99,710 is shown on 16th October lastas compared with the previous count on 12th September last.8.     There were increases in the numbers unemployed in building, public workscontracting, hotel and boarding house service, the distributive trades, the printing industry, laundry service, Local Government service, road transport,dock and harbour service, and agriculture, horticulture, etc.     All these areindustries which are normally subject to increased unemployment at this time of year, but almost all of them show a deeper recession of activity than usual.On the other hand unemployment decreased in coal mining, the textile and clothingindustries, metal goods manufacture, the furniture trades, the fishing industry,and the entertainments and sports industries.9.     The net increase appears to have been due to a relatively large increase which probably occurred in the first two weeks following llth September, after which date considerable decreases occurred, particularly amongst personsregistered as &quot;Temporarily Stopped. &quot;     Moreover the increase included some28,000 persons not normally in the industrial field but registered for war work.It still appears to be the case that the increased demands for labour on accountof the war have not yet absorbed those who have lost employment owing to war conditions, viz. the dislocation caused by evacuation, the black-out, petrolrestrictions, controls of one kind or another, increased taxation and thegeneral change-over from a near-war to a full war economy.10.     The following note shows the position in particular industries:-Building Industry.11.     The increase in the number of unemployed workers of all categoriesrecorded in the last Report has continued.     The number of skilled building workers (excluding painters) unemployed on 30th October was 30,287, which represented an increase of 3,401 as compared with 9th October.     The totalnumber unemployed in the industry (including labourers) at 30th October was117,052, being 8,739 more than at the date of the last Report, and 26,470B^re than before the outbreak of war at 14th August.12.     Although the demand for carpenters and bricklayers on -Government buildingworks continues to be urgent, even among these categories a slight increase in

unemployment has boon experienced, the number unemployed, at 50th Octoberbeing 5,720 carpenters end 10,754 bricklayers as compared with 5,970 and,500 respectively at 9th October.13. This general increase in unemployment in the industry shows that theemergency Government building programme is still failing to absorb the mendisplaced from civil work. The supply of timber for building purposes is such that it is necessary to restrict allocations to essential work and inthese circumstances there is little hope of relieving the position for thesmaller building contractor unless some means can be found of enabling him toparticipate to a greater extent in the Government building programme.Goal Mining.14.     The position generally has continued to remain stable throughout thecountry as a whole and full time working is being maintained in nearly alldistricts.     Recent enquiry in the principal caning areas has shown that by theend of October the number of wholly unemployed skilled workers had- dropped from 20,600 in September to 18,000.15.     The standard of employability of these workers appears to vary a gooddeal and some modification of peace time industrial standards by collierymanagers will be necessary if the majority are to be re-absorbed.16.     A shortage of labour is reported in the expanding Dumbartonshire coal field and this is aggravated by the lack of sufficient housing accommodation which makes it difficult for labour to be imported.Clothing.17.     There has been a marked improvement in employment in the clothing trades and shortages are reported of men and women machinists for canvas work and armyuniforms.      There are considerable numbers of machinists unemployed, but they are mainly workers who are accustomed to the lighter&apos; type of tailoring work and difficulty is being experienced in transferring this labour to the heavier workon uniforms, etc.     A period of training is required and. employers are not generally anxious to give this and at the same time pay what is regarded as anadequate wage.     Machinists not accustomed to the heavier work find, it difficultto earn an average piece work wage, at least for some time.ic&quot; Similar difficulties exist in the case of dressmakers one. milliners of whom there are still large numbers unemployed, though some have been absorbed by firms

engaged on Government work.     Unemployment has also decreased somewhat since last month as a result of the return to London of West 2nd employers who leftLondon shortly after the outbreak of war.Pishing.19.     The improvement noted in previous Reports has been maintained thoughunemployment is still serious in Hull.  arid Grimsby and some of the ScottishPorts.     Buokie and Stornoway in particular have heavy registers end in thelatter port the fish curing industry is seriously depressed as a result ofthe loss of German and Polish trade.     More than a thousand workers in fishcuring occupations in the port -are registering as unemployed.     Hull andGrimsby also have considerable numbers of unemployed in the ancillary tradesbut it may be hoped that the position in these ports will improve when thetrawlers released by the Admiralty resume deep sea fishing.Port Transport.20.      The general improvement in the employment of dock labour has been well maintained, - the total unemployed in the first week of November being in the region of 26,000 as compared with 32,000 a month ago.      The relaxation in thepolicy of diversion of shipping from the East Coast is clearly reflected in thelatest unemployment returns.     In London, the figure for the 9th November wasthe lowest since the outbreak of war though it is still considerably higherthan the peace time average.     Hull, Grimsby, Middlesbrough and Tyne and Wearall show increased activity and while some of the Western ports have not unnaturally dropped off a little from the level reached &quot;when the diversionpolicy was being strictly pursued, they are none the less all active.21.     The scheme for temporary transfer of dockworkers, to which reference wasmade in a previous Report, was brought into effective operation for the first time early in November, -when fifty timbcrmen were transferred to Salford Bocksfor urgent work.Engineering, Aircraft and Vehicles and Shipbuilding Industries.22.     Demands for skilled v/orkers continue to be heavy.Manufacture of Metals.23.     There has been a further fall in the number of unemployed workpeopleregistered in this industry.

Explosives.and Chemicals.24.     Additional employment continues to bo provided in these industries as government output expands;    and the number of women applying for work at certain of the new filling factories continues to rise.CENTRAL REGISTER.25.     The number of engagements reported since the outbreak of war is 1,160.This latter figure is below the true total, as notifications are being receivedfrom day to day of engagements that took place some weeks ago.26.     During the fortnight under review orders for a further 2,161 people were received and so far 1,622 submissions have been made for these vacancies.27*     The number of unemployed men in training at the Government TrainingCentres continues to increase at the rate of nearly one thousand per month-Arrangements are nearly complete for the admission to training of over twothousand soldiers to become Army tradesmen.     Eight Centres for the training ofunemployed women for Army, etc. canteen and similar employment have been set upby the Central Committee on Women !s Training and Employment.JWENILES.Juvenile Employment.23.     There was little change in the juvenile unemployment position betweenSeptember and October.      The number of boys registered at 16th October, 1959was 43,920, a decline of approximately 600, while the girls1 register was 65,793,an increase of over 1,000.     There has thus been no repetition of the rapid risein the girls&apos; register that occurred between August and September.      Londonremains the Division with the highest number of juveniles unemployed, this being a new feature since the war, but although the total number of unemployedjuveniles in London is large - approximately 21,000 - this number does not represent a high percentage of the London juvenile insured population.RECRUITING.29.     Since the date of the last report, an additional 36,000 men have been called up under the National Service (Armed. Forces) Act for service in the Army.Owing to the increased requirements of the Army for December and January, it willbe necessary to issue a further Proclamation on 1st December making the20-?-&apos;0 age-group liable for service.     It is proposed, to register this    age-groupearly in December.

4f r-30,    The work of the Medical Boards, which have also &quot;been engaged on the examination of volunteers, has been proceeding satisfactorily, and thelatest returns indicate that the high standard of physique is, in general,being maintained.     An analysis of the results of the medical examinationsshows that, of a total of 191,865 men examined, 90*6 per cent, have beenplaced in Grades I and II, and only 5.4 per cent, in Grade IV.51.     The most recent analysis of the results of the sittings of the LocalTribunals for conscientious objectors shows that since the date of the lastreport a slightly larger proportion of applicants have been registered for non-combatant service.      80 appeals against the decisions have so far been received,and these will shortly be considered by the Appellate Tribunal.52.     The University Joint Recruiting Boards and the attached TechnioalCommittees continue to function effectively.     There has been an appreciabledecrease in the number of interviews granted - a decrease which was to be expecteoa3 soon a3 the first wave of volunteers had been dealt with.     Since the21st October the Ministry of Labour and National Service has assumed completeresponsibility for the administration of the Joint Recruiting Boards, a functionwhich had previously been shared with the War Office.33.     The terms of reference of the Technical Committees have recently been extended in the light of experience and following representations from theUniversity Vice-Chancellors and Principals.     Men who have completed to the satisfaction of the University at least one year&apos;s work of a course for aspecialised honours degree in certain subjects of a scientific and technicalnature may now come before a Technical Committee on whose recommendation theJoint Recruiting Board may defer a man&apos;s calling up until he has completed hi3course of study.     This will ensure that students are drafted to the forces as fully trained technicians and not at an early stage in their Universityoareer.34* An Order in Council was made on 27th October, under Section 23 of theNational Service (Armed Forces) Act, extending the provisions of the Act tothe I3le of Man.SCHEDULE OF RESERVED OCCUPATIONS.35*     The ages of reservation of a number of occupations in Coal Mining, iron ore and Ironstone Mining and Quarrying, and the Iron and Steel Trades have beenreduced.

,? ftii 055.     Discussions are in progress with the Service Departments, and theEngineering and the Shipbuilding Industries regarding the recruitment ofworkers in these industries to the Armed Forces in their trade capacity.PROVISION PGR. THE IPIBHPIOYED AND FOR RELIEF OP DISTRESS.57,     The number of cases in which allowances were authorised or underconsideration was as follows: --5.11.39.       10.11.59.wmpwmm! assistance(including supplementary allowances toclaimants for unemplovment insurance benefit). 400,000 401,000PREVENTION AND RELIEF OF DISTRESS.(i) Evacuated persons 9,000 8,000(ii) Other cases 26,000 26,00038.     The number of allowances made to evacuated persons has continued to fall, while the other figures have been more or less stationary.     From thebeginning of the month additions have been made to allowances in appropriate cases under the Unemployment Assistance (Winter Adjustments) Regulations, 1938.EVACUATION OF STAFF PROM LONDON.39.     On 21st and 23rd October, some 1,200 of the staff of the Ministry were moved to Southport.     On 3rd November some 250 of the staff of the unemployment assistance Board wei-c similarly moved.(Intd.)   S. B.Richmond Terr ace, S. W.1. list November. 1959.H-Q-525-90 K.I.7.
