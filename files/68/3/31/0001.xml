(y U -JG E R IvI any economic CONDITIONS DURING NOVEMBER 1939.general there have been no conspicuous changes in economicconditions inside Germany during November.    There are signs, however,  that;(i) The pressure of the Allied Blockadeis beginning to make itself felt,(ii) The reprisals measures against exports have increased Germany&apos;s external financial difficulties,(iii) There has been effective resistance tothe attempt to lower the earnings oflabour,(iv) internal financial problems are provingdifficult to solve,(v) Economic relations between Germany and russia are encountering difficulties on both sides,(vi) The possibility is becoming more remoteof Germany being able to develop the productive capacity of adjacent neutralsto her own advantage..    RAW MATERIALS AND trade . There is some evidence that the effects of theAllied Economic warfare are beginning to be felt inGermany.    30 far as can be judged, imports of petroleum products in the first three months of the war have not greatly exceeded 500,000 tons,    imports of iron ore from all sources have been about 1 million tons a month and chrome ore at the rate of 1,500 tons a month.    and while fairly large amounts of copper may have beenobtained, it had become clear towards the end of november that imports in the future were likely to fall far short of the quantity which Germany needs.    No figures forrubber, cotton or wool are available, but the amountsreaching Germany appear to have been unsatisfactory both to Germany and to ourselves,  and as further economic pressure/

A- ii -i- 2 -pressure is applied,  it is probable that the quantitieswill be still further reduced.3. whereas there is no immediate vital shortage ofany essential materials in Germany,  there are now signs that apprehension about the future is beginning to influ-ence her economic policy, both external and internal.k. External;    Germany is still promoting by every possible means her exports to contiguous neutrals, but,when these include important deficiency commodities, itis now her almost universal practice to insist upon the delivery of a proportionate quantity of those raw mater-ials used up in the manufacture of the export goods; and sometimes to require this before the exports are despatched.Exports of woollen goods are disappearing, and only sub-stitute textiles may be sold abroad.    There is evidencethat the practice of subsidising exports is continuing,&quot;but little information about the amount or the form taken&quot;by the subsidies.    In Denmark, German controlled coalimporters have been instructed to sell at a minimum ofKr. 8 per ton below the price of British coal, no matter what the latter may be.    However,  the lower the priceGermany receives for her coal, the less credit she haswherewith to purchase foodstuffs in Denmark.    The greatGerman chemical combine I.G. parben has informed itsaffiliations and customers in other countries that in three months time or less it will not be able to continuesupplies of coal tar products.5. Reliable information about the amount of german trade in the first three months of the war is still notavailable.    The German claim that it has been maintained at 8o^j of pre-war volume is certainly exaggerated.    Witha very few adjacent neutrals it appears to have been well maintained, but with others it has shrunk markedly.    6oy*hy/

-by value, but less by volume, may represent the facts.6. The announcement of the British reprisals actionagainst German exports appears to have had an immediate effect; many intercepted messages disclose the cancell-atScss     wtes e&amp; tw^M&amp;tism, of eaajoir&amp;6&amp; lmmim&amp; tMrisks involved had become too great.    A still more sub-stantial volume of information shows that since the out-break of war a great deal of Germany&apos;s overseas trade vianeutrals has been disguised.    German agents in neutral countries are well organised, and their detection requiresincreasing vigilance.7. internal;    The effects of the blockade, coupled with mobilisation, rationing and the financial experimentsof the recent past, are creating something that in othersystems would be called &quot;unemployment&quot;.    The admitted numberof the unemployed is 150,000 but a well informed neutralobserver writing from Berlin estimates true unemployment at over 1 million.    In Hamburg and in other large portsthere is clear evidence of unemployment, and rationing of foodstuffs and clothing have caused a marked degree of under-employment in a number of trades.    Swedish reportsspeak of one shop in ten being closed, and of 50&apos;,j of factory capacity in many trades being unused.8. a high priority in allocating labour, is stillgiven to the export trades, but there is some reason tobelieve that in certain cases exports of highly manufact-used goods are being made only from stock and that if the pattern offered does not meet the purchasers&apos; requirements,there is difficulty in providing a substitute to order.The output of railway equipment, locomotives and rolling stock, appears to be well maintained.   Activity in the armament trades appears to be intense and other industries such as textile machinery makers are reported to be nowdevoted/

fa rt*v O 0-  k   -devoted to producing armaments.    There is, however,nothing upon which to base a reliable estimate of therate at which stocks of raw materials are being used up.. FINANCIAL POLICY9.  It is still difficult to discover the main features of Germany&apos;s war time financial policy.    During september and October steuergutscheine to the value of some l,hoomillion marks were issued,,    Their issue was suspendedduring November apparently because the increased supplyof shortdated Government paper for the redemption of which no arrangements had been made was having a depressinginfluence on the money markets.    This suggests that in financial matters the Reich cannot entirely ignore publicopinion.    Since the issue of this paper was continuedthere has been some recovery in the bond markets and the yield upon Government securities has fallen.10* Steuergutscheine outstanding can still be used asquasi-currency for a restricted range of business and semi-Governmental payments, but their velocity of circu-lation is low and they do not appear to have any realinflationary influence.    There are,  indeed, few signsof simple inflation in Germany.    Many of the measures taken since the outbreak of the war are better described as deflationary.    The Reichsbank note circulation aspublished shows practically no change since the end ofAugust, although the number of subsidiary notes of theRenten Bank has increased, but this represents,  in partat least, a displacement of nickel coins required for industry.11. The prohibition of currency hoarding decreed onSeptember h,th was at first sight somewhat puzzling,  sincethe mere holding of bank notes is harmless from the pointof view of price stability, and moreover represents an interest-free/

9 r &quot;7interest-free loan to the Reichsbank and via the reichsbank to the state.    it may he that the campaign against currency hoards reflects a desire to gain strictercontrol over free money balances.    Long before the war broke out, owners of bank balances received statementsfrom time to time that their accounts had been debitedwith payments to -&quot;winter help&quot;,  party funds, etc.    it is unlikely that the system has been discontinued, as it isclear that currency hoarding tends to reduce the lootobtainable through this device.12. The other principal measure upon which Germanfinance appears to have rested seems also to have broken down, in part or in whole.    It was decreed at the outbreakof war that all bonuses paid to workers for overtime,Sunday and night work and the like were to be discontinued,The savings in the wages bill were in the original plan to be passed on to the consumer in the form of lower prices.    Towards the end of October this feature of theplan was changed, prices were not to be lowered and theemployers v/ere to transfer the money saved to the Reich.It is now announced in the German press that a large partof these bonuses are to be restored to the workers.    Therelief to the Reich finances will be pro tanto reduced.13. External;    since the outbreak of the war, germany has improved her position in her clearings with thoseEuropean neutrals for which figures are available.    Thetotal debit outstanding against her has fallen from $87million to $70 million,    part of the improvement mustbe attributed to automatic causes, such as the maturingof German claims for exports already delivered uponfairly long term credits before the war started.    Thiswas deliberately arranged by Germany and was an important part of her policy.    So long as neutrals continue to meet their/

their obligations, Germany will continue to benefit.On the other hand, part of the reduction must be attrib-uted to the delays and difficulties encountered byGermany in obtaining imports owing to the dislocationcaused by the war and by the discreet delaying tacticswhich some of the neutrals appear to have felt themselvesable to adopt,,Id. The position of overseas Clearings is more obscure,but dollars still seem to be available to Germany when she needs them.    Intercepted messages show that while sheis in debt to at least one large American bank,  she hassubstantial credit balances with several others.    Thereplenishment of these balances v/ill become increasingly difficult if our control of German exports increases,Germany does not now appear to be having any very markedsuccess in her efforts to obtain foreign exchange by developing a transit trade across her territories betweencontiguous neutralso    Shortages of wagons, fear of seizureand other difficulties have made the plan less acceptable to the neutrals than Germany appears to have liked.FOOD-RATIONING15c As was foreshadowed in the first of these reports,the German authorities have found it possible (or perhapsexpedient) to allow a further increase in rations.    V/hilesome additional supplies are being obtained from theBaltic Gtates,  little appears to be coming in from Russia.There is a report that czechoslovakian products are beingpacked in containers giving them the appearance of goods of Russian origin..    The fat allowance remains unchanged,except for children, where there is a small increase, buta larger ration of butter is now generally permitted.There are to be special supplementary allowances overChristmas,  to include such things as chocolate and ginger-bread-

16. complaints that the permitted rations are notobtainable are now much less frequent,    on the otherhand,  there still appear to be those inequalities betweenthe towns and the country, which became very markedtowards the end of the last war,    supplies of feedingstuffs required by smallholders for their cattle, horsesand pigs are henceforward to be rationed.    This may be anattempt to secure a greater degree of control of the produce of the small farmer producer.17. Germany is making great efforts to increase herpurchases of animal and vegetable oils.    Although she hasnot yet obtained any substantial supplies of soya beansor soya bean oil from Manchuria,  she may draw increased supplies of butter and fats from the Baltic States andof vegetable oils and oil seeds from the Balkans.18. The complete denial to Germany of any part of the oil from the whales caught during the present season, whichwill begin to become available in March next, and thestripping of the Balkans of animal fats and vegetable oils and oil seeds, are matters of increasing importance in thewhole economic campaign.    Animal feeding stuffs,  if thewar is likely to be prolonged, will also increase in importance.    Any shortage of these, and of fats,  is likelyto increase Germany&apos;s difficulties in administering the occupied territories of Poland,  in the protectorate andin Austria, by adding to the unconcealed discontent in thelarger towns,  the sullen sabotage and non-co-operation ofthe smaller farmers throughout the countryside.GERMAN-RUSSIAN TRADE19^ There are signs that the Germans are not derivingany substantial benefit from their trade with Russia,Absolutely reliable information reveals that delays incommunications, difficulties of transportation and theabsence/

9 V!)absence of organisation are causing considerable exac-erbation of feelings upon both sides.    There is sometrade developing in manganese across the Black sea andby river and rail into Germany, but the expected tradein oil has not yet developed.    instead, protracted neg-negotiations for the establishment of a synthetic oil plantby Germany in Russia have been proceeding.    The Germanscannot promise delivery within the time limit requiredby the Russians, nor can they supply other manufacturedgoods which the Russians demand.    The Russians arerefusing to agree to the prices which Germany demands for industrial equipment and threaten to buy them else-where, presumably in the U.S.A.    They are obliged toplead their own shortage of raw materials as the reasonfor failure to do so.    The Germans appear to have aband-oned hope of obtaining non-ferrous metals from Russia andthose who have been sent there appear to find their living conditions almost intolerable.    There is certainly no evidence at all to suggest that Germany is at jiresentfinding in Russia an adequate alternative to her overseassources of supply.&apos;    CONDITIONS IN CONTIGUOUS NEUTRALS20. While Germany is able to exploit the difficultiesof neutrals contiguous to herself in carrying on tradeunder war-time conditions,  there is no evidence that she can or will use her industrial capacity and technicalskill upon a large scale in order to increase their prod-uctivity to her own ultimate advantage.    She does notappear to be prepared to provide Denmark with animal feeding stuffs from the Balkans to replace those which,being intended to produce fats to be supplied to Germany,might reasonably be cut off by the Allies.    She is denyingto Hungary and to Turkey equipment which they need fortheir/

their own development.    Roumania appears to he receivingslightly more favourable treatment as there are reportsof German technicians developing Roumanian oil refiningcapacity and of German materials being sent to develop afishing industry in the Black sea.   German exports, part-particularly of coal,  to Holland and to Switzerland, and perhaps also to Belgium, appear to be relatively well maintained, hut as the money markets of these countries are her principal link with the rest of the financialworld,  the maintenance of her credit in these countriesmust be a matter of first rate importance.21. There is in fact little evidence of a great economic development of Europe from the Baltic to the Balkans forthe benefit of Germany and to the exclusion of the restof the world.    Her policy of repatriating Baits and other german minorities increases her financial power in thecountries evacuated to the amount of the value of theproperty surrendered by the evacuees.    But this policydoes nothing to increase, in fact it probably decreases,the physical production of the countries concerned.22.    on the other hand,  there is evidence that so faras it is politically and strategically possible for themto do so,  the neutral countries are profiting from the warand are driving harder bargains with Germany.    There is evidence that the flow of goods into Germany has been restricted by the refusal of a number of neutrals to allowtheir railway wagons to cross the frontiers into Germany.Higher prices are being demanded for products which are sold, and in some cases the conclusion of agreements withGermany have been held up because the contiguous neutralconcerned has insisted upon the supply of quantities andtypes of goods which Germany is increasingly reluctant tosupply.

23. It is probably unwise to attach too muchcredence to reports of suffering and hardship in neutral countries resulting from the war.    The mostpersistent of these originate in Moscow.    A distinction should be drawn between those neutrals which are chieflyprimary producers and those which are commercialised orindustrialised.    Holland and Belgium, for example, are more likely to suffer than the Balkan countries, who are able to exploit their improved bargaining position and to demand higher prices from both Germany and the Allies.If the war is prolonged, their financial position islikely to be improved, but it appears unlikely that theirproductive capacity will increase markedly unless theyare able to obtain additional quantities of fertilisers,transport equipment and other products of a manufacturing industry.24.    These are to a large extent precisely the products of which Germany will stand in greatest need herself asthe war proceeds.    The Allies are, therefore, confronted with the problem of denuding these neighbouring countries of supplies by methods which do not add to their capacity to increase output for the benefit of Germany in theimmediate future.    Allied export policy to contiguousneutrals may, therefore, become of increasing importancein fortifying the blockade measures, the influences ofwhich are already beginning to be felt by the enemy.
