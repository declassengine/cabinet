(R) (39) 84)Enemy Air Attack.1.      Raids were made on the Shetland Islands on the 13th and 22ndNovember in the course of which about 24 bombs were dropped.      Inthe first raid the damage was negligible;    in the second aBritish seaplane was destroyed.      There were no civilian casualties.2,      The presence of hostile aircraft has also been reported invarious areas, particularly over the Thames Estuary, the EssexCoast and the Orkneys and Shetlands.      An extensive reconnaissan^0took place over Lancashire, Cheshire and North Wales on the 15thNovember.      Parts of the country have been under the yellow(preliminary) warning every day during the period except on the15th, 16th and 26th November but red (public) warnings were given on seven days only.Air Raid Precautions Services.3. The conditions of payment for A.R.P. volunteers absent fromduty owing to sickness or injury have been settled and issued tolocal authorities. Whole-time paid volunteers may be allowedsick leave on full pay up to a maximum of 3 weeks after 3 monthsqualifying service. After 12 months service sick leave up to amaximum of 3 weeks on full pay and 3 weeks on half pay may be

Experiments continue with a view to allowing the maximum practicable amount of assistance to movement in the black-out.A large number of long distance trains are now provided withlights adequate for reading.      The installation of speciallighting equipment in suburban trains and tube trains which runin the open has begun, and improved interior lighting for busesis almost completed.      The succession of moonlight nightshas unfortunately prevented satisfactory tests of the proposedmodified street lighting.      Reports have been received that just under half of the coke ovens in the country have been eithercompletely screened or are in process of being screened.Air Raid Warnings.5. Instructions have been issued to local authorities regulating the testing of sirens and some tests have already been carried out.Supplies of Steel Shelters.6.     There was some reduction in the numbers of steel sheltersdelivered during the week ending November 20th, but in thefollowing week deliveries were nearly up to the previous rate andthis is expected to be maintained.Emergency Fire Brigade Measures.7.     Over 80 percent of the revised local Auxiliary Fire Servicewar establishments in England and Wales have been fixed orprovisionally assessed, and the figures for London are now being examined.

A good many representations are being received on theProvisional assessments and some small readjustments will benecessary, but not to any great extent.      When the London figures have been settled, it should be possible to reach a fairly close

approximation to the aggregate final figures.8.      In Scotland about one half of the establishments have been settled;    and as regards the remainder, further consultation withthe local authorities has been necessary in many cases, but it isanticipated that all establishments will be rapidly cleared up.Casualty Services.9.      On Sunday, November 26th, the number of vacant beds inEngland and Wales was approximately 151,000, a reduction of some9,000 in the fortnight.      As in the preceding fortnight, this reduction has been caused partly by the continued influx of normalsick into hospital and partly because the release from theEmergency Hospital Scheme of many of the smaller ard the Class 2hospitals is still affecting the figures.10.      If necessary, more beds could be made available for casualtieswithin 48 hours without necessarily repeating the operation of sending home sick who are fit to go.      The figure of 151,000 bedsdoes not include the whole of the 100,000 extra beds which havebeen issued by the Ministry of Health, because arrangements forequipping and staffing these are not everywhere complete.      If an acute emergency arose, however, the arrangements could be accelerated and the beds occupied and it is probable that the actualfigure of beds available, including Class 2 beds (i.e.  those whichcould only take medical and convalescent cases) is nearer 200,000.11.      In Scotland the number of beds available for casualties is11,600, a drop of 400 in the fortnight.      It is expected that bythe end of November 1,300 beds will be available in huttedannexes;    another 1,200 beds will become available in December;and a further 3,000 v/ill be ready in January.12.      Payments to voluntary hospitals are continuing on afortnightly basis.      The Ministry of Health have had a discussion

with the British Hospitals Association in order to settlearrangements for a quarterly review of the actual loss oradditional expenditure incurred by individual hospitals as aresult of the Emergency Hospital Scheme.      The interim payments will be adjusted upward or downward on the facts revealed by thequarterly review.13.      One or two voluntary hospitals where casualty beds arereserved have represented to the Ministry of Health that theycannot continue to keep open unless some contribution is made towards their capital debt.      The Ministry have not been able toagree that any contribution can be made to the capital debt of a hospital and the King Edward Fund Committee are investigating thecases in order to consider whether they can help.14.      The terms of service of consultants and other doctorsenrolled in the Emergency Medical Service have now been revised.The conditions originally agreed with the medical profession forthe employment of consultants and specialists meant that suchpersonnel as enrolled whole-time were not available for ordinaryprivate practice nor (to some extent) for specialists&apos;  clinics.In the course of September, since the war was not taking the turnwhich had been anticipated, attempts to relieve the situation were made by offering doctors either indefinite leave from theEmergency Medical Service without pay or part-time service up toa limit of four days a week in return for one-third salary.Neither of these proposals was taken advantatage of to any extent.15.      It has now been agreed on the recommendation of a specialAdvisory Committee of the Central Medical War Committee that afurther offer should be made on the basis of a part-time salary of  500 per annum (instead of a whole-time salary of  800 or 950), this salary to cover not only such duties as are required under present conditions, but also such additional work as

circumstances might require.      Doctors in this category wouldbe expected at all times to render as much service as might be necessary  without any increase in remuneration.      Subject tothe first call on their services by the Emergency Medical Service,they would be free to engage in private practice or any other work.      This arrangement should result in a saving to theExchequer and in a considerable easing of the situation as regardsprivate practice.16.      A further change in the arrangements is that in voluntary hospitals where no whole-time clinical staff (other than HouseOfficers) are employed, the Ministry of Health will pay thehospital for medical attention at the rate of ls.6d. per day perbed occupied by casualties or other cases within the scope ofthe Emergency Medical Service, and will make a similar paymentof 6d per day in respect of each out-patient attendance.      Thesesums are intended to constitute a fund out of which the medicalstaff will be paid on a basis to be agreed between them and thehospital.      So far as in-patients in such hospitals are concernedthis replaces the arrangement, which was occasioning considerabledifficulty in practice, under which doctors could be employedon a sessional basis at the rate of 1-g- guineas or 2-g- guineasper session.17.      In view of the different conditions and differentorganisation of hospitals in Scotland the application of the revised scheme is being discussed separately with the ScottishBranch of the British Medical Association.18.      The Minister of Health has taken the opportunity to effect a settlement with the profession on the principal remainingoutstanding question of the medical staffing of first aid posts.It has been agreed that local authorities should be authorisedto increase the responsibility of the general practitioner incharge of a first aid post in a vulnerable area by putting him in complete charge of the posto      He will in effect become a

temporary officer of the local authority and be generallyresponsible for the running of the post,  including generalmaintenance and administration and stores.      In recognition ofhis increased responsibilities local authorities are beingauthorised to pay him a salary at the rate of  75 a year.      Thispayment will replace the payment of 20 guineas per annum atpresent made to the medical officer In respect of the collectivetraining of the personnel of the post.      This latter sum will,however, remain payable in respect of first aid posts in areasnot covered by the new scheme.      Similar action is being takenin Scotland.19.      It was planned that 200 Green Line Buses should be availablein the London Sectors for transfer of casualties from inner toouter hospitals.      Shortly before the war the London passenger transport Board offered a further 200, which were accepted.      Ithas now been decided to release 150 buses, which will be returnedto passenger service.      They can be recalled for ambulance use,should urgent need arise, at about 24 hours&apos;  notice.      Therelease will result in substantial savings in hire charges and wages.20.      Ten of the twenty-eight Casualty Evacuation Trains whichhave been held in readiness since the beginning of the war forinter-hospital movements have also been released.      The releaseof these trains will enable the Railway Companies to put a certainamount of much needed rolling-stock into current use, as wellas providing coaches needed for the additional ambulance trainswhich are required by the War Office.Evacuatioru21. Evidence available indicates that the drift back to the towns continues. It is not considered that the rate of thisdrift is increasing, but as there is no appreciable movement

outwards, each, week shows a reduction in the number remaining in the receiving areas.      The London County Council report that20 per cent of the evacuated school children have now returned.22.      Action continues to &quot;be taken to arrest this movementas far as practicable.      On November 17th a circular was issued to local authorities advising them that their plans in regardto the operation of the evacuation scheme should be based onthe assumption that those who have been evacuated should,  inthe national interest, remain in the receiving areas throughoutthe winter.      Suggestions were made as to the measures whichmight be taken in order to further this object, such as thedevelopment of communal services, a redistribution of billetingin the receiving areas and the encouragement of action whichcan be taken by the evacuated persons themselves and theirrelatives.23.      After consultation between the Departments concerned,a scheme has been drawn up by which special cheap railway facilities will be available on Sundays for visits to evacueesunder the Government Scheme.      The facilities will be availableonly to places to which there are not already cheap facilities,and where the return journey can be made in one day.Arrangements for London, Edinburgh and Dundee are now complete and the first trains will run on December 3rd.      The need for providing special facilities from certain other centres to their reception areas is still under consideration.24.      Special consideration has been given to the difficultieslikely to arise from the desire of parents to be reunited withtheir children at Christmas.      The return of children to theevacuation areas has been deprecated and an appeal has been madeto those in the receiving areas to organise some simple

i 0 ?1. Co **entertainment &quot;both for evacuated children and for the children of householders who are looking after them.    The evacuationareas have teen asked to contribute to the cost of suchentertainments.25.    At the  same time an appeal has been made to parentsnot to visit their children during the Christmas season.The arrangements for cheap fares described above will not operate on Sunday, December 24-th or Sunday,- December 31st.26.    The response to the proposals for the furtherevacuation of ex icctant mothers has proved disappointing.In consequence of the steady fall in the number of occupiedbeds in improvised homes in the reception areas the futureof the emergency maternity service is receiving carefulconsideration.     In Scotland some of the accommodationreserved for this purpose has already been released.27.    Returns are now available showing the resoonse to theGovernment&apos;s apneal for contributions from the parents to thecost of billeting of schoolchildren     Of the cases dealtwith in England,  comprising the great majority of parents,51% of the offers made are acceptable,  30% are unacceptable,and the remaining 19% are either assessed at nil or are on public assistance or unemployment assistance and so make no direct payment.Schools,28.    In view of the fact that the work of Technical Schools,Evening Institutes,  etc.  was considerably restricted by the requirement that the number of students admitted must notexceed that for which shelter could be provided,  a circularwas issued to Authorities  informing them that refuge accommo-dation need not be made for the full number of students who

might he attending an institution.29.A Defence Regulation has been made enlarging thepowers of Local Education Authorities to provide air raidprotection for non-provided public elementary schools,Public Order.30.Public order and morale continue to be excellent.the reaction of the public to anti-aircraft fire and enemy air-craft where    the latter have been seen has been curiosityrather than alarm.    Some concern is, however,  said to havebeen caused in the Liverpool area at the thought that an enemyplane could penetrate so far.31. Arti-war propaganda shows signs of diminishing.    TheFascists seem to be the most active of the anti-war organisa-tions, and their propaganda now tends to be largely anti-Jewish.Railways.32. Up to the present the appeal made to trade and industryto reduce the time taken for loading and unloading wagonshas not resulted in any appreciable improvement in the wagonposition.      Large numbers of wagons are still being detainedunder load, particularly in the coal industry.Docks and Harbours.33. Conditions at the ports continue satisfactory but therehas been some delay to shipping entering and leaving certainEast Coast ports owing to enemy mine-laying in the approachchannels.    A slight diversion of shipping from London wasnecessary.Road, Trans-port.34. There is no substantial change to report in the position

A * 0of either goods or passenger road transport which, havingregard to the difficulties imposed by restrictions in thesupply of fuel,  is generally satisfactory.    The number of goods vehicles available for work shows an upward tendency,  dueno doubt to the effect of releases of vehicles hithertoreserved for civil defence.    This tendency is likely to becounteracted in the near future by further impressments forthe Army and an increase in Army hirings.    A further reductionin the consumption of fuel by goods vehicles has been achieved, but consumption is still in excess of the amountallocated.Blectricty.35. Reports to the Electricity Commissioners from theCentral Electricity Board show a serious number of inter-ruptions of supplies of electricity during the week-ends18th-&quot;i 9th November and 25th-26th November caused by barrageballoons breaking away and interfering with the grid systemof the Central Board.    Damage has been caused to grid lines and transformers and in some cases supplies have been cut offfor 24 hours.Alternative Accommodation for Government Staffs.36. The number of staffs already moved to places outside london is 16,894.    The number-of staff moved during theperiod under review was 1,400.    Other moves are under considera-tion.JA.Ministry of Home Security,Home Office,Whitehall.30th November,  1939.
