(39) 95.TO BE KEPT  UNDER  LOCK AND  KEY.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a report submitted by Sir Campbell Stuarton the work of the Department of Publicity in Enemy Countries for the period the 22nd October to the 20th November.IT.November 27, 1939.ENEMY PROPAGANDA.Report by Sir Campbell Stuart, G.C.M.G., K.B.E.ON the 22nd October I had the honour to submit a report on my activities.I now present another which covers the ensuing period to the 20th November.Leaflets.Since the 22nd October, some four million leaflets have been disseminatedby aircraft over Germany. One of the three flights made reached Berlin andanother Munich. The leaflets carried were versions of the Prime Minister&apos;sspeech on the 12th October and one which contrasted statements made by theGerman Chancellor. In addition, since early November, there have been almostregular balloon flights, and more than a million leaflets have been distributed in this way. There is not, of course, the same control of direction; but eventhough numbers of the leaflets may be scattered over country areas, there issatisfaction in knowing that, in this event, they present a particularlyembarrassing problem to the Gestapo. Moreover, there may be strokes of luck.On the 8th November, for instance, a number of balloon-borne leaflets fell overthe towns of Chemnitz and Freiberg at a time when the inhabitants were ontheir way to work.Reports in regard to the effect produced by leaflets ai&quot;e conflicting. It is,however, noteworthy that the Nazi Leaders seem almost invariably to refer tothem in their speeches and that, according to reports received, they are passedfrom hand to hand over considerable distances and have even reached Vienna.The French, indeed, have no doubt of the value of our leaflet campaign, andare proposing largely to increase their own output. Most significant of all, our enemies are paying us the compliment of imitation.10725   [20382] n
In regard to the interest aroused by our leaflets, the following intelligencewhich has come from a known source in Belgrade will, perhaps, be regarded as of interest: &quot;British leaflets are sometimes collected in the following way : i hetime chosen is at night because, owing to the black-out restrictions, the streetsare unusually dark. The searchers, as a rule young girls, go out in pairswith a tiny electric torch. Whenever they see a likely piece of paper theymark it down mentally, but do not stop to pick it up because of the numberof possible watchers, police agents and the like. Only after having walkedanother hundred yards or so does one of the girls slip back in the darknessand collect her prize.&quot;The reports, on the other hand, which indicate that the British leaflets are either discredited or of little effect in Germany may, it is submitted, be taken as a reflection of the insensibility of the great numbers of Germans to externalinfluence of any kind. Until either military defeat or a general sense offrustration has shaken confidence in the Nazi regime, little or no progress ranbe expected among its existing supporters. To hold, however, that the news and views imparted by our leaflets do not tend to strengthen such forces of discontent and potential resistance as exist in Germany would, I believe, bea great mistake. The brutal censorship, on whidh the Nazis depend, ensures thata premium is placed upon news from without. Propaganda in a hostile countrycannot, moreover, be expected immediately to gain acceptance. It must createits own authority and forge its way by insistence and reiteration. To abandonit would be to proclaim our failure in an effort which has demonstrably perturbedthe German GovernmentFor these reasons I submit that we should proceed with the dissemination,by all means open to us. of printed propaganda, which increasing informationAvill enable us to aim with ever greater accuracy. The undoubted success of ourGerman broadcasts justifies the belief that in print the same type of propagandacannot be without considerable effect.Der Wolkiger Beobachter.During the period under review, my Department has produced a new formof propaganda for distribution by aircraft, in the shape of a small four-pagenewspaper illustrated by cartoons. Its title (The Cloud Observer&apos;) plays upon thewell-known Volkischer Beobachter. One edition of 750,000 copies is already in process of dissemination, and another is being prepared. It is intended thatthis new production shall be issued weekly and shall contain items of news whichhave not reached the German people, brightened with light paragraphs, cartoonsand verses. The French have adopted our idea and have also printed the firstissue of a newspaper on similar lines.Broadcasting.Reports from within Germany continue to show that tuning-in to the Britishbroadcasts in German continues. The French Secret Service have, I am informed,concrete evidence that listening to foreign broadcasts is increasing in that country,and it has been officially learned from French officials and other sources that theBritish broadcasts are more popular than any other. A letter from SouthGermany which has reached the B.B.C. states that &quot; everybody in Germanylistens to foreign broadcasts. As a result there is a great feeling of insecurity &quot;The Belgrade authority, already quoted, adds to his message : &quot;it was perfectlyevident from the news discussed among the younger people that the Britishbroadcasts in German were listened to regularly and attentively.&quot; The individualwhose experiences it relates had been invited to listen and stated that &quot; thenexisted a whole series of places, cellars and other buildings, difficult for theauthorities to trace, where set-owners listened regularly and invited their friends.&quot; Another secret report states: &quot;listening to foreign wireless is, ofcourse, forbidden, but nearly everyone who has a set listens. They put heavyblankets over the wireless and over their heads to listen in.&quot; Yet another fromDusseldorf declares that &quot; listening-in to the English station is carried outuniversally.&quot;   Many reports of a similar character have been received.
The evidence is, indeed, more than sufficient to justify an important extensionof B.B.C. broadcasts which is to begin on Sunday, the&apos; 26th November. after this date an extra half-hour will be devoted early each morning to broadcastsin German, Czech and Polish. The object is to reach working-class listenersbefore they leave their homes.Interesting evidence as to the range of broadcasts has been provided by theB.B.C. Polish Service. Letters have recently been received from listeners toit in Hungary, Roumania, Lithuania, Latvia, Denmark. Norway, Yugoslavia.Italy, Turkey, Belgium, Holland and even Palestine.Co-ordination with the Fighting Services.From long before the outbreak of war I have maintained close contact withthe Fighting Services and have received much assistance from them. As the warprogressed, however. 1 felt that there was an increasing necessity forco-ordination of my propaganda plans with naval, military and air strategy.Accordingly, after discussing the matter with the First Lord of the xAdmiralty,the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for Air, I arranged for a meeting of members of my Department (including a representative of theForeign Office) with representatives of the Services. A number of satisfactoryconclusions were reached which will ensure a speedier and more direct supplyof information to my Department. It was also agieed to take common action inthe preparation of propaganda plans of a secret nature, such as the initiation ofwhispering campaigns. So hopeful and important were the possibilities our discussion revealed, that it has been decided to hold, at least, fortnightly meetings.In this way, I believe that I shall be able to ensure the closest relationship of myefforts to the military developments of the war.Relations with the Press.In my last report I mentioned that, in view of the greater secrecy which hadattached to my Department since the 17th October, I had thought it wise toconfer with the leading newspaper proprietors of London and the Provinces.One result of my first discussion with them was an agreement to form a smallprivate committee. This met on the 2nd November and was attended by major the Hon. J. J. Astor, M.P., the Hon. Rupert Beckett, the Hon. EsmondHarmsworth, Sir Roderick Jones, Sir Walter Layton, Mr. J. R. Scott andLord Southwood. The discussion was of the most friendly kind, and the general lines of my Departments policy were approved. Tt was agreed that futuremeetings should be held at my discretion, and that Sir Charles Hyde,Mr. Allan Jeans and Mr. W. Harold Thomson, Chairman of the Scottish DailyNewspapers Society, should be added to the Committee. One of the subjects discussed was publication of criticisms of our leaflets in the Press, and it was generally agreed in principle that such criticisms were calculated to help theGerman propaganda department. All present, therefore, undertook to ensure thattheir respective journals avoided them.Censorship of the Texts of Leaflets.During the past few weeks I have had some discussions with the Censorship inregard to prohibition of the publication of the texts of my Departments leaflets.The reception accorded to a &quot; Stop &quot; notice which deprecated it has shown thatthe great majority of British newspapers are prepared to accept a restriction ofthis kind. The reasons which I adduced to support the case for secrecy were,briefly, as follows :  1. Publication in Great Britain of the texts of leaflets would be likely to befollowed by publication in the Neutral Press, and consequently by neutralcomment. If this were favourable the German authorities would be stimulated to increased precautions; if unfavourable, it would be used against us.2. It would be difficult to permit the publication of some leaflets and to forbid that of others, inasmuch as our enemies would be swift to deduce our reasons for discrimination.3. My Department is closely associated with the Fighting Services, andit is probable that its activities will be increasingly co-ordinated with strategy.Propaganda may, indeed, become a part of military operations.   It is therefore[20382] B 2
a matter for serious consideration whether the publication of leaflets addressedto German troops in the line and disseminated in connection with militarymovements should not. be forbidden.4. It is possible to imagine circumstances in which it might be undesirable that neutrals (say Russia and Italy) should be publicly informed by us of thepurport of certain regional distributions it may be desirable to undertake withinenemy territory.Refugees.I am able to report continued good progress in the organisation of the variousRefugee Groups in London. Our contacts with Germans, Austrians and Czechsare now so firmly established that we are receiving considerable assistance from them in preparing and collecting information about conditions in their respective countries as background for our work.Liaison with France.During the past week I learned that the Grand Quartier General has decidedto intensify French propaganda activities by leaflet distribution on a large scale.The decision was based on reports received by them indicating that opinion inGermany was gravely disturbed at the prospect of prolonged hostilities. inreporting this fact to me my liaison in Paris pressed me personally to attend ameeting there of the Anglo-French Enemy Propaganda Liaison Committee, whichoperates under the authority of the Anglo-French Propaganda Council, in orderto discuss the preparations for the French leaflet campaign. As I was unableto leave London, my Deputy-Director went in my stead. The meeting was heldon the 17th November, and he has since reported to me that it was entirely satisfactory. He was able to compare both the experiences and the products ofmy Department with those of its French counterpart, and to discuss plans of future co-operation. His readiness to be of every possible assistance to the Frenchwas, I understand, warmly appreciated. Moreover, a suggestion put forward byhim that, in order to counter the German propaganda effort to divide the allies,a joint Anglo-French leaflet should be issued by both countries, was welcomedeagerly, and a draft which he had taken with him was immediately approved.In the course of the discussion the French expressed the view that the publicationof the texts of leaflets in the Press was undesirable, and stated that they intendedto approach their Censorship authorities with a view to forbidding it.As a result of the increased interest of the Grand Quartier General inleaflet propaganda, and the probable enlargement of output on the part of theFrench propaganda department, the necessity for the co-ordination of the propaganda policies of the two countries becomes even greater than before. Inview, however, of the recent meeting in Paris, I am inclined to believe that, thanks to the goodwill of the French authorities, and their appreciation of British efforts,it will be possible for me to achieve the co-ordination desired.Fecamp.An unexpected obstacle to the full and orderly working of Anglo-Frenchradio propaganda into Germany has arisen. The British wireless stations underthe B.B.C. have, since the outbreak of war, been working on a system whichall the experts of the Air Ministry and of the B.B.C. are in complete agreement to be essential to prevent enemy aircraft using broadcast programmes as a meansof finding their way to their chosen targets in this country. This re-arrangement of peacetime procedure has imposed limitations on the programmes, but is accepted as essential by the B.B.C. engineers no less than by the Air Ministry if national security is not to be jeopardised. The French experts had not made the samepreparations in advance as had the English, but they began shortly before thewar to put their house in order. Close and fruitful liaison was established between the French experts and those of the Air Ministry and the B.B.C. thefirst necessary steps and those particularly important to this country as involvingstations in the north of France had been taken shortly after the outbreak oiwar. It was believed by those concerned in this country that British national security, so far as it was affected by French broadcasting, had been safeguarded.An unexpected set-back then had to be faced. A station at Fecamp in Normandy,in which Captain Plugge, M.P., is interested, and which had been closed down
some considerable time before the outbreak of war, was, under pressure frominterests in this country and in France, allowed to reopen. This station at Fecampis broadcasting every day in English for the benefit of the B.E.F., and in Austrianand other foreign languages. It is a menace to national security in northern france and Southern England. Representations have been made at the instiga-tion of the Air Ministry, through the British Ambassador in Paris, to the french authorities. Until this station is closed down it will be difficult to pursue thediscussions so fruitfully begun on Anglo-French co-operation in propagandabroadcasts to Germany. It is impossible to discuss broadcast programmes solong as uncertainty remains as to which stations will be available for broad-casting. It will further be impossible to discuss broadcast propaganda in a spiritof full mutual confidence with the French so long as doubt remains in the minds of our Allies as to our national policy over the conduct of broadcasting as awhole.Meeting with the Dominions Ministers.In view of interest shown in the work of my Department by the Dominions,I thought it right, after consultation with the Secretary of State for theDominions, to take advantage of the presence of the Dominion Ministers inLondon to explain the scope of my activities and to ask for any suggestions orcriticisms they might have to offer.A meeting took place at my London headquarters on the 17th November, andwas attended by the following : *The Hon. R. G. Casey (Australia).The Hon. Peter Fraser (New Zealand).Colonel Denys Reitz (South Africa).Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan (India).The High Commissioner for Australia.The High Commissioner for New Zealand.The High Commissioner for South Africa.The Duke of Devonshire was also present.The Hon. T. A. Crerar was unavoidably absent, but I have arranged toexplain the whole matter to him in a private interview.The discussion was in every way satisfactory. As one result of the meeting,arrangements have been made for all the visiting Ministers to broadcast toGermany in the immediate future, expressing the attitude of their respective countries towards the War.Conclusion.After some twelve weeks&apos; experience of its working I have found that myDepartment has become much more than a transmitter of print and words toGermany. Copious and sound information is essential to propaganda, and myintelligence section has had perforce to attain a high degree of efficiency. It isnow, for instance, supplying, in addition to its ordinary duties, a regular reviewof German Propaganda to the War Cabinet, and a daily summary of information to the Services and some other Departments. The fact, moreover, that myDepartment requires the swiftest and most exact information of the effects pro-duced by its activities has necessitated the creation of what, although small in number, is virtually a secret service of its own. Again its effort to influenceopinion in Germany has demanded that it should pursue every channel whichleads there. As already indicated, one of them is German residents in neutral countries, another neutral newspapers likely to percolate into enemy territory.Thus the range of its activities tends to increase.During my earlier connection with the Ministry of Information I stipulatedfor way-leaves to Germany through neutral countries. Thanks to the close liaisonmaintained from the first between us, and to the fact that my object of reaching the enemy differs essentially from that of the Ministry, no conflict between our respective efforts has arisen or should ever arise. I am, indeed, inclined to believethat, in the near future, it may be possible for my Department, in view of theexperience it has gained of German propaganda methods, to render effective aidin countering German propaganda, not only in Germany, but wherever its evilinfluence is effectively employed.
