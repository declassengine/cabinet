1.     There is much activity in connection with claims for increased wages,but negotiations generally proceed with a minimum of friction.     There is some division of opinion and practice on the question whether the advancesshould be on a sliding scale basis in relation to the cost of living indexfigure.     Very broadly it would seem that in the smaller industries andconcerns this expedient is more favoured than in the larger.      In thisconnection,  it is interesting to note that the two large and importantgeneral workers1 unions are understood to have given their officialsinstructions to avoid committing themselves to cost-of-living sliding scale wage agreements.2.     Since the outbreak of war, the cautious approach of official tradeunion circles in the matter of demands for wage increases has beennoticeable.     They have had to face, however,  some degree of pressure fromtheir rank and file, and also a not unnatural desire on the part of localofficials to take advantage of the immediate opportunities the situationpresented for recruiting new members.     The whole issue in its widestaspects has now been brought before organised employers and workers inthe statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the second meeting of the National Joint Advisory Council on 6th December.     after some preliminary discussion of the implications of the statement, it wasagreed that it should be further considered at the next meeting of theCouncil to be held on 5rd January.3.     Notice of intention to apply the Trade Boards Acts to the FurnitureManufacturing industry is about to be published,  agreement having beenreached as to the scope of the industry for this purpose.     In this industry there has been very little regulation of wages and conditions,and in the East of London this fact has been a potential source ofdisturbance which it is hoped will be removed by the establishment of a trade Board to fix statutory minimum rates of wages.

*? P- V(j &apos;a jEMPLOYMENT   AND   UlMffiLOTMENT.4.     The number wholly unemployed continues to show a steady decrease,particularly amongst women workers and noticeably in the North Y/esterndistrict.     Unemployment amongst men in London shows no improvement andthe position in the area comprised by London and the Home Counties must continue to receive close attention.     It is expected that when the resultsof the monthly count on 11th December are available,  they will show some improvement in the miscellaneous group of office and clerical staffs, shop assistants and miscellaneous unskilled workers.     Unemployment inagriculture and building will, however, probably show another increase.The demand for skilled workers in the engineering, aircraft, vehicles and ship-building industries continues to be heavy throughout the country.Employment in the explosives and chemicals industries continues toimprove.Supplementary Register.5.     As   announced in the Press, a Supplementary Register for persons withprofessional, technical and business attainments has now been established to replace the temporary procedure set up at the outbreak of war.     It ishoped that the full support of Government Departments will be forthcoming.Building Industry.6.     The total number of wholly unemployed workers aged 18-64 years(excluding casuals and temporarily stopped)  in the building industry at27th November was 132,492, representing an increase of 3,100 as comparedwith 13th November.     The number of skilled workers, excluding painters,unemployed on 27th November was 37,325, being 3,258 more than at15th November and 18,643 more than at 14th August.     A comparison with thetotal numbers unemployed in the building industry at 14th November, 1938,when 160,104 workers were unemployed shows that in spite of recentincreases, unemployment in the iridustry is still less   severe, than ayear ago.

7.     Increased unemployment among skilled workers as compared with a yearago exists in certain occupations such as bricklayers, plasterers, andslaters and tilers, which have suffered most from the cessation of private building and the curtailment of local authority housing schemes.     On theother hand, carpenters have secured increased employment, mainly on government work.8.     Since the outbreak of war the industry has become increasinglydependent on Government and air-raid precaution work and the employmentposition is largely governed by the demand of these works.     The works and Building Priority Sub-Committee is responsible, subject to ministerial authority, for planning the Government&apos;s programme, and inorder that the Priority Sub-Committee may have the advice of the industrymore readily available, two Advisory Panels representing employers andworkpeople in the building arid civil engineering industries, respectively,have been set up.     Among other matters the plight of the smaller buildingfirms is at present under active consideration and steps are being takento explore the possibility of spreading the Government1s building programme in such a way that the smaller contractor shall have moreopporturdty for participating.Coal Mining.9.     The employment position in coal mining remains substantially thesame, though there has been a further slight decrease in the numbersregistered as unemployed.     The rate of improvement has slackened offconsiderably and there is not much doubt that transijort difficulties arethe most important factor in slowing down expansion.     There is understood to be a heavy accumulation of railway wagons underload at receiving points,and it is to be hoped that the new demurrage charge will result inimprovement.Other mining and Quarrying.10.   The curtailment of much municipal and civil building, resulting in adecreased demand for slate, has caused a considerable rise in unemploy-ment in the slate quarries.     The possibility of increasing the use of

*j    ***V 0 Jslate on the Government&apos; s emergency building programme presents a numberof problems,  and these are being studied urgently by the Departmentsc oncemed.Textiles-11.   Employment continued to improve in the textile industry and therewas a considerable reduction in the numbers unemployed, particularly of lancashire Cotton Operatives.     While there is still a fairly   largesurplus of female weavers in Lancashire it includes many women of advanced years who are unable to adapt themselves to work or more loomsor to processes to which they have not been accustomed.    It is largelyfor this reason that firms are reporting shortages of skilled workers.Clothing.12.    There has been a slight deterioration in the clothing trades, apartfrom the manufacture of shirts, waterproof garments and boots and shoes.The increase in unemployment is largely in the tailoring trade in London,and is probably the result of the usual seasonal causes.Fishing.13.   Probably as a result of the further&quot;requisitioning of vessels from certain ports, there was a slight increase of unemployment amongstfishermen at the beginning of the month, Grimsby, Lowestoft andMiIford Haven being adversely affected.   Hull, on the other hand, has improved considerably in recent weeks.Port Transport.14.    Unemployment in the docks has continued to decrease and the numbersregistered as unemployed are now low even by peace-time standards.      TheEast Coast ports have continued to benefit from the relaxation of the diversion of shipping, and there has been a decrease of unemployment in practically all of them.     In the last three weeks London has had lessthan 5,000 unemployed, which represents a return to peace-time level.Manchester and Southampton have been particularly active and local labour in these ports has been fully engaged.

9 f\THE CENTRAL REGISTER.15.   The following statistical return shows for the period up to 15th December, 1939,the vacancies notified to the Central Register, the number of persons submitted for the vacancies and those notified to date as engaged.Statement of Orders received, Persons recommended, Submissions made andNotifications of Placings from the outbreak of War to 15th December,&quot; 19*59.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.period to 30th November11 1st -15th DecemberOrders cancelled between 1st - 15th DecemberTOTALS TO 15th DecemberPeriod to 30th November&quot;   1st - 15th DecemberOrders cancelled between 1st - 15th DecemberTOTALS TO 15th DecemberGovernment.

9,p116. A comparison of the numbers of persons notified as having heen placed eachfortnight is shown, in the following figures:-16th - 30th September     -       451st - 14th October        -       38i16th - 31st October        -     2641st - 15th November       -     74516th - 30th November       -     2921st - 15th December       -     73317.   The explanation of the high figures in the first fortnight of November andin the fortnight covered by this report is that visits were paid to the mainOrdering Departments to confirm placings arising from a large number ofsubmissions   made (a) immediately before the outbreak of war, and (b) in the six weeks after the outbreak of war, when rapid expansion of Departments madea regularised procedure difficult.     The bulk of these contacts has now beenmade, and it is hoped to start the New Year with all such arrears liquidated.18.   The number of cards in the Register, including 2,380 persons earmarked by departments before the war and 2,117 placed from the Register since the outbreakof war, is now 83,260 as compared with 81,800 a fortnight ago.19.   The number of posts carrying commissioned rank notified to the Registerrose during the past fortnight from 74 to 117.     During the period the numberof administrative, etc. posts was over twice as many as those covering the scientific, industrial and professional fields.TRAINING.20.   The number of civilians in training at the Government Training Centrescontinues to increase.     It is proposed to institute an intensive recruitingcampaign early in the New Year in order to meet the expansion programmes whichare rapidly maturing.     The first batch of serving soldiers to be trained asArmy tradesmen has arrived at eight Government Training Centres andLocal Training Centres, and further batches are expected in the New Year.

0 C: 9O \J OJUVENILES.Juvenile Unemployment.21.   No fresh statistics have come to hand since the date of the last report,but there is reason to believe that the decrease then reported in the register of juvenile unemployed is continuing.RECRUITING.22.    The registration of the men covered by the Royal Proclamation of the1st December took place on Saturday, 9th December.     The machinery of registration worked according to plan and the number of men registeredamounted to 24-1,582, as compared with the total of 21S,251 registered on21st October last.     As at the time of the previous registration, a largenumber of the men expressed a preference for Naval or Air Force Service.     no less than 70,603 stated their preference for service in the Air Force, and34,208 for naval service, representing in all nearly 50 per cent of thetotal registered.     The total number of men provisionally registered asconscientious objectors was 4,965, representing just under 2.1 per cent of thetotal.      This was  .06 per cent less than the percentage for the registrationon 21st October.23.   Since the date of the last report 27,952 men have been posted under theNational Service (Armed Forces) Act for service with the Army.24.   An analysis of the results of the medical examinations shows that of301,185 men examined 89 per cent have been placed in Grades I and II.     Thesefigures show that there has been a slight falling off in the high standardof physical fitness of the men which was revealed in the earlier returns.25.    All the fifteen Local Tribunals which have been set up under the Actto decide the applications of men to be registered as conscientious objectors are now at work, and the most recent figures show that 3,318applications have been heard, of which 487 or 15 per cent have been grantedunconditionally and 590 or 18 per cent rejected.      Of the remainder 1,476men or 44 per cent of the total have been registered as conscientious objectors conditional on their undertaking certain civil work specified bythe Tribunals, and 765 or 23 per cent of the total registered for service in the Forces but of a non-combatant nature only.

SCHEDULE OF RESERVED OCCUPATIONS.26.   The amendments made to the Schedule have been few in number and of relatively small importance.27.   Following representations of the difficulty which would be met by theservices and production, increased reservation was granted to certainoccupations in these industries.28.   Discussions are proceeding with industry and the Service Departments asto types of men required in the Armed Forces for service in their tradecapacity with a view to ensuring that highly skilled men are not recruitedunless full use can be made of their skill.29.   In consultation with the Scientific Research Committee of the CentralRegister, arrangements are being made for applications to be considered fromreserved scientists for permission to volunteer for service with the Forcesin a non-scientific capacity in cases where it is found that they will not be needed in a scientific capacity in the Forces or in civil life.      In suitable cases scientists will be enabled to volunteer for military service, and thepanels will advise them as to any branch of His Majesty&apos;s Forces where theirscientific training will best be utilised.PROVISION FOR THE UM^iPLOYED AND FOR RELIEF OF DISTRESS.30.   The number of cases in which allowances were authorised or underconsideration was as follows:-Railways and the Glassmaking and Optical Trades in maintaining essential1st December, 1939.8th December, 1939.UNEMPIOYiJENT ASSISTANCE(including supplementary allowances to claimantsfor unemployment insurance benefit)400,000399,000PREVENTION AND relief of DISTRESS(i) Evacuated persons(ii) Other cases25,5006,00025,0005,500(Intd.)
