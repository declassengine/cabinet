INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.h.    At a meeting of representatives of the British Employers&apos; Confederationand of the Trades Union Congress General Council held on the 18th October, itwas decided to set up a Joint Advisory Council under the Chairmanship of theMinister of Labour and National Service.     The two organisations eachnominate 15 representative members.     The function of this Council, which isto be purely advisory and is not to invade the province of joint organisationsin the respective industries, is to consider, in connection with wartimeproblems affecting Government and industry, all matters in which employers and workers have a common interest.     The first meeting was arranged for the1st November.2.     As regards the general labour situation the relationship between wages and prices dominates all else.     Following the rire in the cost-of-living figure,there have already been many increases in wage rates,  either automatically underagreements providing for a sliding scale based on the official figure or asa result of special negotiations.      These increases all tend to make it moredifficult to resist further demands.      Generally speaking, Trades Union policy has been to &quot;go slow&quot; in this matter, but pressure from the rank and file is becoming steadily more insistent.3.     The industries in which national or sectional agreements for increased wages have been made in the period under review include the following:-     Cotton,Coal Mining, Lock V/brkers, Y/elsh Tinplate, Siemens Steel, Electrical Contracting,Engineering (women), 7&apos;wholesale Clothing Trades, Hosiery, Leather Tanning, Curryingand Pressing (Midlands), Chemical Lidustry (firms other than I.C.I.), Paint,Colour and Varnish, Seed Crushing and Provender, Jute.     Applications for increases are at present under examination in the following industries amongst others :-Clay Industries, Electric Cable making, Distributive Trades, Baking (Scotland),Boot and Shoe Manufacture, Waterproof Garment Trade, Pottery and electricity supply.     Amongst the trades for which statutory minimum rates are fixed by trade Boards, three have decided to propose an increase of the statutory minimum rates, and three others have the matter under consideration.-*     Problems connected with the &quot;black-out&quot; are still prominent, but show no signs at present of becoming generally acute.     The difficulties, however, beingfor the most part of the sort which affect the workers&apos; nerves will tend to grow^ore acute as the strain continues.

&amp; 1 i)EMPLOlltEM] AM UNEMPLOYMENT.Unemployment Figures.5.     The number of Wholly Unemployed (including Casuals) fell between9th and 23rd October by 6,000 to 1,110,000, but rose to about 1,118,000 at theend of the month.    It seems probable that the Wholly Unemployed figure againcontains a considerable number of persons not normally in the industrial field,(see note under Explosives and Chemicals below).6.     Petrol restrictions continue to be z-egarded as responsible for a good dealof unemployment.7.     Improvement has occurred in the boot and shoe making industry, particularlyin Norwich and the Midlands, where there is said to be marked prosperity in this trade.     Workers are also being re-absorbed into the entertainment industry insome areas, notably London, Midlands and North Midlands, owing to the relaxation of restrictions on places of amusement.      The furniture trade also shows some improvement.8.      In agriculture, the demand for seasonal labour for lifting the potato and sugar beet harvests is now beginning.     Two of the former sources of labour forthis purpose,  namely Irish labour and local women workers are not available tothe same extent as formerly, however, so that it may be difficult to meetdemands in full.Coal Mining.9.     The position generally has been stable throughout the country as a whole.full time is being worked in many districts, and miners who were unemployedbefore the war are being absorbed.     Active steps are being taken in the NorthEastern Division (in conjunction with the Yorkshire Mineworkers&apos; Federation)and North Midland Division to increase output, and in the latter Division thereare demands for good and efficient workpeople v/hich cannot be met locally.In the Northern Division the position has improved but there has been someintermittent short time working in certain areas in Northumberland and Durham.There was some temporary slackness at Blyth and Amble due to a shortage ofshipping but the collieries have now resumed full working.     The collieries in durham affected by the dislocation of shipping and other transport work arechiefly those in the Horden, South Shields, Stanley and Seaham Harbour areas.Eight of ten collieries in the South Moor and Holmeside group at Stanleyworked intermittently, and an agreement has been reached between the Employers2.

and the Miners 1 Association under which six of these collieries have beenplaced on a half weekly rota system.      The remaining collieries in the grouphave not been included in the agreement since they produce mainly coking coal,and full time working is possible.Other Mining and Quarrying.10.      There has been an increase in unemployment among workers in stone quarries,particularly in Wales, where a number of quarries have been closed and short time is being worked at others, because of a lack of demand for material.     Oneof the principal factors is understood to be the curtailment of road works.Textiles.11.     ho change in the general position is reported.    At Braintree, Courtauldsare engaged in parachute silk manufacture but the position in the real silkindustry is bad.12.      The tent making industry at Oxford is improving.     Carpet looms inScotland have been transformed for the making of Army blankets, and the jute,tweed and woollen industries are busier with Government work.     In North Midlandsthere are more unemployed in the lace and silk trades and an iaigora wool millis threatened with complete closure, as the importation of the raw product from france has ceased.Clothing.15.      In the Eastern Division trade is good in the hat and cap industry, andthe boot and shoe trade is active in Southern, Eastern and North MidlandDivisions.14.     In London there is a gradual improvement in dressmaking and millinery,and in the tailoring trade an extension of Government contracts has given animpetus to employment, though there is a shortage of machinists for heavy work-in the Southern and Scotland Divisions there is a large unemployed register ofdressmakers and bespoke tailors.Fbshing.15&quot;     While the position in the industry remains serious, there has been considerable improvement in recent weeks and it is to be expected that furtheramelioration will result from the recent decision of the Admiralty to release acertain number of trawlers requisitioned at the outbreak of war.     The portslikely to benefit from this in the near future are Hull, Grimsby and Cardiff,which were extremely hard hit by requisitioning.

ig.     The curtailment of fishing in Scottish waters will continue to have an adverse effect on employment in various ports and the restriction imposed byHie Admiralty on drifters will inevitably cause increased unemployment this autumn&apos;     Many less drifters than usual are being allowed to go south and this cannot but have a serious result on the employment, not only of the fishermenin the Scottish ports, but also that of the workers in the ancillary trades:-fish curers, basket makers, barrel coopers and net menders.Port Transport.17.     Over the country as a whole employment has improved somewhat but condi-tions continue to fluctuate even more than is usual hi the docks.      On19th October the total number of workers in the port transport industry who wereunemployed was in the region of 30,000 as compared with 38,000 on 11th September.In London, unemployment remains at a considerably higher level than in peacetime, but it is expected that there will be some improvement owing to the relaxation of the maximum diversion of shipping from the East coast which obtained in the earlier part of October.     Liverpool has benefited very considerably from the diversion of shipping and unemployment in the port has fallen by about 4-0 per cent.     Middlesbrough has also recovered considerablybut Hull remains seriously affected with between 3,000 and 4,000 dock workersregistering as unemployed.18.     Mention was made in the last Report of the war time transfer scheme.      TheUnions have been recruiting volunteers under the scheme for the past two weeks and it is understood that the response has been good, though total figures arenot yet available.Other Transport.19.     Petrol rationing and vehicle pooling schemes are factors in the depressionin the road transport industry.      In London, unemployment increased among motor vehicle drivers from 5,296 on 25th September, 1939, to 6,137 on 16th October, 1939.A principal reason for the increase is thought to be the reduction in the needfor transport of all descriptions owing to the number of people who have leftLondon.Engineering. Aircraft and Vehicles and Shipbuilding Industries.20*     These industries are rapidly adjusting themselves to the requirements ofWar, the motor industry, in particular, which had suffered depression as theresult of the outbreak of v/ar, seems to be making progress in converting plant to manufacture munitions of war.

21.     Ship repairing yards ere reported as fully employed, mainly on admiralty work.     As a result of Government contracts and intensification ofwork on naval construction, there is a heavy demand for skilled workers inthe shipbuilding industry, and very few are now unemployed.     The conversionof trawlers is stated to be proceeding without difficulty in regard to labourre quirements.Manufacture of Metals.22.     The employment position in these industries continues to improve.     Allthe metal industries are reported to be busy, many of the iron and steel firmsworking to capacity, although a shortage of steel is still affecting certainsteel sheet works in Pales and shipbuilding yards on the dyne.      There areoutstanding demands for workers in the metal trade and many firms are making arrangements to train semi-skilled workpeople.Explosives and Chemicals.23. Extra wcrk has been provided owing to increases in Government contracts.It is anticipated that there will be heavy demands for labour for munition worksnow being erected, and numerous applications for munition work have been madeby women, large numbers of whom have not in recent years or have never looked to insurable employment as a means of livelihood, particularly at Chorley, atthe Royal Navy Cordite Factory at Poole., and at explosives works in Scotland.Building Industry.24.     Since the date of the last Report the number of unemployed workers of all categories 121 the building industry continued slightly to increase.      The numberof skilled building workers (excluding painters) recorded as unemployed on 9th October, was 26 , 886, being 2,648 more than a week ago and 8,204 more than before the outbreak of v/ar at 14th August.     The total number unemployed. In theindustry (including labourers) at 16th October was 116,100, representing anincrease of 7,787 as compared with the previous week and of 25,518 as comparedwith 14th August.25.     This increase in unemployment has taken place despite the urgent demandfor workers, particularly carpenters and bricklayers, on the Government building programme.26.     The cessation of most private and speculative building v/ork and therestrictions on the issue of timber to contractors engaged on non-essentialbuilding work v/hich have proved necessary have been specially felt by the small

benefit under existing arrangements from the large Government contractsarising in connection with the Defence Programme.     This is particularly truein England and Wales where the organisation of the Industry is hot adapted,to sub-contracting.      The skilled men in these contractors&apos; organisations,carpenters and bricklayers particularly, have not much difficulty in obtainingemployment on large Government projects, though even among these classes ofworkers there has been a slight increase in unemployment recently.     On15th October the numbers of carpenters and bricklayers unemplojred were 4,428and 10,190 being 458 and 690 more than on 9th October.      The other classes of skilled workers, particularly plasterers and plumbers, have suffered a larger increase in unemployment, as well as those engaged on the administrative sideof the small contractors&apos; businesses.THE CENTRAL REGISTER.27.     During the period from 16th to 31st October orders for 394 persons weremade on the Register.     Some 1,800 people were recommended by the expert panelsof the Register for submission to the ordering Departments or firms.      There isclear evidence of increasing use of the Register.     264 persons were definitelynotified to the Central Register as having been appointed during that period,but a considerable number of others are known to have been appointed although this fact was not notified to the Register during the period.23.     The posts for which submissions have been made include a number of postsof a salary of  1,000 a year and over and posts for which a variety of special qualifications are required and in regard to which special care has to be taken.in the selection of candidates.TRAINING.29.     Recruiting among the unemployed for training at Government TrainingCentres in engineering and building, for work of national importance, continuesto proceed rapidly.     A scheme for the training of soldiers to be Army Trades-men is under discussion with the War Office.RECRUITING.30.     The registration of the men in the 20 to 22 age group not alreadyregistered under the Military Training Act took place on Saturday, 21st October.The machinery of registration worked smoothly and according to plan, a fact which was due  ;in no small measure to the ready co-operation of the men them-selves.     A certain number of men who were unable to attend for registration6.contractor whose organisation is generally not such as to enable him to

*v ^ y0n &quot;the due date have registered during the past week, and the total numberof men registei^ed now stands at 225,14-9.     An exceptionally large proportionof the men expressed a preference for Naval or Air Force service.     No lessthan 66,692 stated their preference for service in the Air Force and 38,491 for naval service, representing nearly 50 per cent,  of the total registered.     Thetotal number of men who were provisionally registered as conscientious objectors was 4,848, representing 2 per cent, of the total, and approximately the same percentage as when the militiamen were registered last June.31.     It is not as yet possible to state the precise number of men who were liable to register but failed to do so-     Although it was estimated that thetotal number of men liable to register would reach the figure of 250,000, it-is possible that in arriving at this estimate insufficient account was taken ofthe number of men within the age gi-oup already serving in the Forces.32.     It is intended to exhaust as far as possible the register formed underthe Military Training Act before calling up the men covered by the firstProclamation made under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act, but it isanticipated that a small proportion of the latter will be required to make upthe numbers for the intake into the Army on the 15th November.35.     Since the 14th October, 63,000 men have been called up under the NationalService (Armed Forces) Act, for service v/ith the Army, making a grand totalof 114,300 since the introduction of cojnpu.Lso.iy military service.      In addition5,397 men have been called up under the Act for service v/ith the Navy and2,000 for Air Force service.34.     All the nine re-^ozia-fcj tnted -Local Tribunals v/hich have been set up to(1^,1 with the applications of men to be registered as conscientious objectorshave stated-tod to operate, and the most recent figures show that 898 applicationshave been heard, of which 113 or 13 per cent, have been granted unconditionally,and 189 or 20 per cent, rejected.     Of the remainder, 365 men or 41 per cent,of the total have been registered as conscientious objectors conditional ontheir undertaking certain civil work specified by the Tribunals, and 231 or26 per cent, of the total registered for service in the Forces but of a non-combatant nature only.

PROVISION FOR THE RELIEF OF DISTRESS.35.     The number of cases in which allowances were authorised or underconsideration was as follows: -20..i2i39&apos; 27.10.59.(i) Evacuated persons 12,000 10,000(ii) Other cases 26,000 26,00036.     These figures do not axopear to call for comment except perhapson the continued fall in the number of cases of evacuated persons whichstood at 46,000 on 15th September.37.     There were no developments of importance in connection with Juveniles,the Schedule of Reserved Occupations, Unemployment Insurance orUnemployment Assistance.(Intd.)   E.
