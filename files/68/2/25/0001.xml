(H)  (39) 65 Copy No. gW A R   CABINET.PROPAGANDA:    APPRECIATION OF ACTION taken and ITS EFFECTSecond Report submitted &quot;by the Minister ofInformation, covering the period 17 September to29 October.(Previous Report: Paper No. YAP.  (R) (39) 15Initialled M.2nd November, 1939.

PROPAGANDA: APPRECIATION OP ACTION TAKEN_AND ITS EFFECT_I regret that, owing to my preoccupation with the internal affairs of my Ministry, involving the separation of the News andCensorship Divisions and the comprehensive overhaul of the remainingDivisions, I have not &quot;been in a position to submit a Report since themiddle of September.     In this Report, I propose to set out  ac. breifly as possible the main action taken since that date.     In future, I would propose to submit a fortnightly Report, as I feel that this will enablene to give a more satisfactory picture of the activities of the Ministry,than I could in a weekly report.A. HOME(1)      B.B.C.Arrangements have been made for a programme of ministerialtalks.     A Member of the War Cabinet will speak at intervals of a fortnight, and in the intervening week a topical talk will he givenby some other Member of the Government.     Her Majesty the Queen hasgraciously consented to speak to the Women of the Empire on the 11 thNovember.(2) FILMSThe film &quot;The Lion has Wings&quot;, showing the work of the R.A.F.has been completed and was shown for the first time in public on October30th. Seven travelling cinema vans are at work in reception areas inScotland and nine more will be ready shortly.(3) PAMPHLETS AND POSTERSSix million copies of the pamphlet &quot;Make your Home Safe&quot;have been distributed.     An &quot;anti-gossip&quot; poster campaign has been planned in conjunction with the Service Ministries.(4) REGIONAL ORGANISATIONIt has now been decided to adopt a simplified scheme.

A single local representative of the Ministry will &quot;be appointed in each region.     He will &quot;be associated with the Regional Commissioner andmay have the assistance of an Advisory Committee composed of prominentlocal people and including representatives of the political parties andpossibly of other organisations. The voluntary committees will be ina position to use the appropriate political machinery and social serviceorganisations within each region. The object of this arrangement isto secure complete flexibility within each region, and to give wide scopeto local initiative, hut the Ministry1 s representative will be guide,philosopher and friend to the local voluntary organisations and will serve as a link with Headquarters.(5) general  would stress the importance of keeping the public fully in-formed of events and explaining to them as far as possible the policywhich H. 1.1.Government are pursuing. At the moment, my officials are inconsultation with other Government Departments with a view to givingsuitable publicity to explanations of the difficulties which have arisen in connection with Civil Defence Regulations, and the commandeering of schools, and to prepare the way for the institution of rationing.B. OVERSEASMy Ministry has been largely concerned with overcoming diffi-culties and delays in communication. Radio-telephonic communicationwith the U.S.A. and Scandinavia, and a daily air-mail service to Prance,Holland, Belgium and Scandinavia have resumed. The establishment ofthe land telephone service to the Balkans and Scandinavia was recently approved by the Cabinet and should shortly be in operation.       A project for an air-mail service to Lisbon connecting with the &quot;Clipper&quot; service to U.S.A. is also being actively pursued.Twenty-one Press Attaches abroad have been appointed since theoutbreak of war with a consequent increase in administrative and clerical staff. These distributing centres have &quot;been supplied with a number ofspecial pamphlets, five thousand copies of the Blue Book, four thousandfive hundred copies of White Paper (Germany) No.1 and several, thousand

photographs. Translation -of - -the Blue Book in French, Swedish, Dutch,Danish and..Bulgarian have been released. Seventeen thousand copiesof the Dutch translation have already been solda     Sanction has teengiven to twenty-one posts for the translation of White Paper (Germany)No.1. In the week, October 4-th to 11th, the Swedish press devoted1 90 column inches to British photographs as compared with 77 devoted to german photographs.Apart from the dispatch of such official publications and theprovision cf feature articles required by particular countries, I have tried, as far as possible, to assist the existing means of publicity:-(1J ..british J^$EAB RSMy Ministry at present pays the freight charges for the dailydespatch to Holland, Belgium and Scandinavia of substantial consignments of the British newspapers sold there before the outbreak of war.     Thesenewspapers are on sale in Belgium and Holland on the day of issue, in scandinavia on the following day,       I hope shortly to extend this ar-rangement to Switzerland, Italy and the Balkan countries, by means of the paris/lieston Air Service and the Simplon/Orient Express.     I am making enquiries whether a greater number cf newspapers is required and whether their sale might be further stimulated by making a free supply to news-paper offices in the countries concerned,(2)    B.B,C,With the addition of Greek, the number of broadcasts in foreignlanguages has risen to 15- Overseas talks during the past week have dealt with Kerr Ribbentrop!s speech, the apparent stalemate on theWestern Pronto problems of contraband, clianges In German life since 1918,transport of the B-..EoP, to Prance and Cartoonists in war-time (by DavidLow),        All the existing transmitters are working to full capacity andI am making enquiries as to the possibility of expediting the delivery of five further transmitters which are now in course of construction.The monitoring service is in full operation.       Material amounting to\ million words daily is condensed in a digest which  provides a valuableguide for counter propaganda.

Jfc&apos;(3)    FILMSThe newsreel companies have now each a representativeattaohed to G-.H.Q. in France.Araerica presents a special problem as it lias been our policy to rely upon straightforward news rather than propaganda for the state-ment of the British case.     Once the neutrality issue has been settled by Congress, I shall consider, in consultation with our Ambassador,whether more active measures may not be required, such as the use ofindirect propaganda through concerns like the International Tea ControlSoheme and the International Rubber Control Scheme.The Dominion and Colonial Governments have been receivingmaterial on a similar scale with our missions abroad.      Their special requierements are receiving attention and I have taken steps to improve the B.B.C. Empire Service.       A weekly military commentary on the Waris being given to the Empire Press Agencies.EFFECT.In general the position is more satisfactory than when I sub-mitted my last report.     The conclusion of the Turkish Treaty andBritain1 s successful defence against air and submarine attack have hadan encouraging effect and prove once more that solid achievement is thebasis for successful propaganda.       herr Ribbentror)&apos;s speech received abad press except in Italy and Spain, and his arguments failed to carry anyconviction even in countries bordering on Germany.     There is increasedspeculation in neutral countries as to German internal conditions, the scandinavian papers citing instances of internal disagreement and economicscarcity and leading up to the conclusion that in the long run the re-sources of the British Empire will tell.     In France excellent publicityhas been given to the British war effort, particularly in the case of theNavy, and there has been a noticeable insistence on the part played bythe British Dominions.     In the U.S.A. the papers are more favourable tous and more violently anti-Nazi than before.     The vote in the Senate onthe arms embargo should not, however, be interpreted as a pro-British

swing, as the isolationist feeling remains as strong as ever, andthere is still certain scepticism about the British determination to prosecute the War with energy.       The Italian Press remainshostile and both there and elsewhere there is an urgent necessityfor continued publicity effort.11November 2nd 1939.
