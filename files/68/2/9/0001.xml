This Document Is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos; sGovernment.SECPET^.Y/.P.(R.) (39) u10*WAR CABINET.BURNJUThird. Periodical Report submitted by the Secretary of Statefor Burma,  covering the period 1st to Ihth October,  1939-(Previous Report Paper Ho. 17.P. (R. )  (39) 55* )1.  G-cncral.The country generally rei.ia.ins quiet.The former Premier, Dr. Pa Maw, has formed a so-called&quot;Burma Freedom League&quot; or &quot;national Front&quot;  composer! of a section of the supporters (&quot;thakins&quot;) of the D (foam a Asi Ay on(the Nationalistic Organisation), the Students&apos; Union andcertain former Ministers;   this group has issued a manifestourging that Great Britain should immediately recognise Burma&apos;right to determine her own form of government,  that a constituent Assembly should be summoned to frame a Constitutionacceptable by Burma,  and that, -pending the meeting of thisConstituent Assembly,  the Governor should be required to be guided by the advice of his Ministers in all matters,  includingDefence.    The manifesto adds that,  if those demands are granted,Burma1s whole-hearted co-operation with Great Britain in theconduct of the War will be assured.Tne manifesto is supported, by the vernacular pressSenerally, but the Governor does, not regard this movement under^-* Be    hav^s leaaership as of much importance at present.Those Ministers - three in number,   including the Homeminister, U Ba Pe - who are not members of the Defence Council,

influenced partly by the publication of the above manifestoand partly by attacks upon then in the press on the scorethat they have allowed the Defence Council to usurpMinisterial functions, have raised with the Governor thecuestion of tho scope of the Defence Council&apos;s aetivitics.They profess,  however,  to bo content with, the assurances given by the Governor to the full Council of ministers that the activities of   the Defence Council will be strictly limited to matters directly arising out of the conductof the War,  and that the competence of Ministers to dealwith matters normally within their charge will not boinfringed.    With these assurances the Governor coupleda promise of periodical informal discussion with thev/holc Council of Ministers to keep them possessed ofinformation relating to the bar.On the same,  or perhaps the next,  day, however,  thePremier presented to the Governor two minutes by the Councilof Ministers.The first was a protest against the omission to  invitea representative of Burma to the impending discussions herewith Dominions representatives and a representative of India,stigmatising the omission as neither politic nor fair.To this protest, which is evidently inspired largely byjealousy of the position accorded to India in the councils of the Empire,   the Governor has boon advised to replyinformally by explaining that these discussions arc inno sense a &quot;Conference&quot; but are designed simply to afford an opportunity for informal and strictly business discussions between rep re s ent a t i vo s of the Dominion Governments andthe Ministers in the United Kingdom respectively concerned

ft Ifwith such matters as the despatch and maintenance overseasof military forces or personnel for training, andthe increased output of manufactured articles requiredby this country or by the Dominions for War purposes;and that,  in those matters, Burma, whose V/ar effort must, in the nature of things,   consist mainly in -anincreased output of raw materials,  is not directly concerned.    It remains to be seen whether this ratherspecial pleading will satisfy Bufman psychology.The second minute was a    representation, moderatein tone,   that if, as is generally understood in Burma,the recent consultations between the Governor-Generalof India and Indian political leaders will shortly resultin a statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government as to thefuture political status of India as an equal partnerin the British Commonwealth,  the claims of Burma toequo.1 advancement should not bo overlooked.    To this request the Governor has been advised to reply, also bythe medium of informal conversation with the Council ofMinisters,  that the statement the making of which theyare correct in forecasting will not be a statement byHis Majesty&apos;s Government but by the Governor-General ofIndia to the people of India,  that the recent controversywith the Working Committee of Congress and the moslem league has centred round the question of the futureCentral Government of Federal India - a question which has nocounterpart in the unitary state of Burma;  and that Burma-las already made a great step forward along the path ofprogressive development to a fuller measure ofself^government in the association of ministers in theDefence Council for the disposal of matters connected with

h.Defence, which, by the Act, are reserved to theGovernor in his discretion.    It is hoped that, byrepresenting- these points at once to his Ministers, theGovernor may so prepare their winds for the reception of the Viceroy&apos;s statement that, when they digest itscontents,  they will realise their request to havehe on inappr-op pi a t e.2,    Defence 11 easures.Enrolment in the Burma Auxiliary Eorce, previouslyrestricted to European British subjects, has boon thrownopen to ail British subjects born and domiciled in Burma,and the raising of an anti-aircraft, battery in the auxiliary Porce has been authorised.3.

An enquiry into the justificationA or these increases has been authorised as the increase lea00 a threat of a strike by the Burmese-owned &apos;bus companies&quot;-^hich might load to trouble.
