Weekly Report on Action takenWar Trade Agreements and Relations with Neutral Countries.The chief event of the week has been the signature in rome on the 27th October of the agreement with the ItalianGovernment for the establishment of an Anglo-Italian JointCommittee.      Negotiations are continuing in London with theSwedish,  Netherlands,  Belgian and Icelandic Delegations..   ADanish representative is expected shortly to open preliminaryand informal discussions about a War Trade Agreement,   and ithas been decided that a representative of the Ministry should go to Oslo for a similar purpose as soon as the Norwegianshipping negotiations have reached a satisfactory stage.Preparations for the negotiations to be opened soon withthe Spanish and Portuguese Governments are continuing..2.  The position in the various countries is briefly asfollows:-SWEDEN3.    The Head of the Swedish Foreign Office left forStockholm on the 28th October taking with him a draft war trade Agreement in the form of a Protocol with attachedDeclarations which have been agreed with the Swedish TradeMission, but subject to the approval of the respective governments.h.    The drafts will be submitted very shortly to the&apos;Var Cabinet by the Minister of Economic Warfare.5-    Negotiations are proceeding with the delegation of Norwegian ship-owners, headed by Sir Thomas Pearnley, whichis now in London;    but progress is slow.6o    The Norwegian Government have protested through their Minister in London against the necessity of Norwegianimporters signing declarations as to ultimate destination ofgoods/

goods imported from the United Kingdom.      It has &quot;been pointedout to them that such. indivfdua3-^e-clar^ti^n^oan_.no-dou&apos;bt be dispensed with when a  Var Trade Agreement has been concluded.The Norwegian Government have,  therefore, pressed again that negotiations for a /Var Trade Agreement should be begun, butthey have been informed that the negotiations cannot start untilHis Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied with regard to shipping.As soon as satisfactory progress has been made in this respect,a representative of the Ministry will go to Oslo for preliminaryWar Trade discussions.DENMARK.7.    On the 23rd October the Danish Minister informed theMinistry that his Government were ready to send a representative to London to open preliminary discussions for a   &apos;/ar Trad.eAgreement.      This offer has now been accepted.80    A satisfactory settlement has been reached in a casearising out of transhipment in the free port of Copenhagenwhich seemed likely to cause serious difficulties.      The danish government were ready to  allow a cargo of scrap iron carried bythe Danish s.s.&quot;Delaware&quot;  on a through Bill of Lading to Gdyniato be transhipped for a German port.      Thanks to vigorous action by His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Copenhagen,   this v/as prevented andarrangements were made that the cargo should be bought by thehanish shipping company and kept in Denmark until after the war.FINLAND9-    A further meeting with the Finnish representativesv/as held on the 20th October at which the conversations re-garding the trade between the two countries and the principlescf a War Trade Agreement were continued.ICELAND10.    Two meetings with the  Icelandic Delegation have beenheld.      it has been found impossible to  arrive at an agreedformula for a  /ar Trade Agreement owing to Iceland&apos;s desireto/

to maintain a strictly neutral attitude.      It will therefore-oe necessary for the U.K. Government to control Iceland&apos;s trade-0v unilateral action,  to which the Icelanders will givereluctant assent.      They are friendly and will,  it is understood,be prepared to acquiesce.3AT.TTC STATES11.    A number b. ships flying.the Estonian and Latvianflag respectively, having-on-hoard c ar go e a --ojai gj n a ting in-thosecountries,  and bound for a neutral country, have been seized bythe Germans,  who have demanded a guarantee against seizure fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government before releasing them.12.     Small  consignments of foodstuffs have arrived, f^ornEstonia and Latvia in the United Kingdom, but the cost oftransport has proved almost prohibitive.BELGIUM &amp; HOLLAND13.    Negotiations with the Belgian and NetherlandsDelegations for the conclusion of War Trade Agreements started at the beginning of ifedst week and are being actively pursued.Phe negotiations will probably be protracted, but as yet there is reason to anticipate that they will fail.SWITZERLANDId.    On the 18th October the /Swiss Minister was informed in reply to his G0vernment&apos;s initiative that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were,  in principle, prepared for the opening of negotiations for the conclusion of a provisional agreement regarding the economic relations between the United Kingdom and switzerland during the v/ar.      The French Government are proposing to submit to the Swiss Government a formula similar to that to0e submitted to the Belgians with regard to war trade.15.    On the 26th October the Soviet Government handed tos Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Moscow a note in reply to thebassador&apos;s notes of the 6th and 11th September which had communicated/

JL b &apos;JcomiT1unicated the British contraband list and notified theestablishment of contraband control.      The Soviet Governmentchallenge both the contraband list and the system of examiningneutral ships.and declared their refusal to recognise theBritish note,  which contained the list of contraband articles,as having any force.Id.    Sianid.ar-l.y_.the__S.onur ij-j3krv^?n^ e.xjc-eption ,tq , theforcible examining of the merchant ships of neutral countries^adding that those of the U.S.S.R. were Government vessels andso should not be subjected to any measure of compulsion.17.    The note ended by reserving the right of the SovietGovernment to demand compensation for any loss incurred as aresult of the aforementioned measures.18.    A reply is under consideration.19.    His Majesty&apos;s Government also have under consideration-the pos-sdJadility&apos;--ofhh\n^ between GreatBritain--and the U.S.S.R. which,  apart from the. rec-ent -barteragreement, has largely ceased since the war.YUGOSLAVIA20.    The Yugoslav Government have announced their intentionof taking over the whole Yugoslav out-put of minerals and mineralores, with the intention of disposing of the exportable surplusas a compensation basis in return for the delivery of essential requirements, primarily armaments.      The National Bank has furthercancelled an exchange agreement with the British Trepca MinesCompany.      sir R. Campbell,  and his French colleague,  haveprotested against this action.      Lord Halifax has also informed the Yugoslav Minister of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Governmenton this question.      According to the latest reports from Belgrade,xt appears probable that a satisfactory compromise will be reached.^GARJEa .21.    A meeting of the Departments concerned has been held0 co-ordinate the action to be taken regarding purchases from bulgaria./

-5--i. 3 0Bulgaria.      Certain purchases,  notahly of oil-seeds,  were decided on in principle,  one of the chief difficulties being that of price.      It was agreed that the Treasury would examinethe possibility,  in approved cases,  of departing from its principleof allov/ing losses only up to 15hb      As regards sales,  the questionof assisting the Bulgarian authorities to obtain from the Unitedkingdom market the raw materials they required was examined,HUNGARY22.    It has been decided in principle that,  while it wouldprobably be undesirable to negotiate a formal War Trade Agreementwith Hungary,  steps should be taken in conjunction with the hungarian Government to work out a system whereby the Hungariansshould be enabled to obtain the raw material they require fortheir own internal consumption in return for guarantees of non-export to Germany and for willingness to maintain or increase their export of foodstuffs to the United Kingdom.ITALY23.    The conversations with the Italian Government were resumed on the 23rd October, when Mr.  Rodd,  the&quot;representativeof the Ministry5  returned to Rome.      The agreement sotting upthe Anglo-Italian Joint Committee was  signed in Rome on the 27thOctober by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and the Head of the CommercialDepartment of the Italian Foreign Ministry.      Pending the aiipoint-nent of a permanent Chairman of the British delegation to theJoint Committee, Mr. Rodd has been appointed acting British&apos;Chairman,2d.    Arrangements for buying from Italy hemp,  sulphur,&quot;tarcury,  silk and motor-boat engines are well advanced.      Butus Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has pointed out that there is no time  QG lost,  since German competition is intense.      There arendications that we are already in danger of losing valuableopportunities by moving too slowly,  and that in the case of hempXii particular we have been to a large extent forestalled by Gormanpurchases./

purchases.25,    The Italian Government are showing themselvesincreasingly susceptible as regards the application of contraband control measures to Italian ships&apos;.      Almost every case in which an Italian ship is detained now gives rise to informal protest,-n spite of the fact that Italian ships are receiving preferential treatment,  to v/hich other neutrals are beginning to take exception.PORTUGAL26.    The Commercial Secretary to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy atLisbon has been for the last fortnight in London in close touchwith members of various departments of His Majesty&apos; s Governmentand is collecting material for the negotiation,  on his return tohsbon,  of a War Trade Agreement with the Portuguese Government.SPAIN27.    An interdepartmental commission, under the SpanishMinistry of foreign Affairs,  has been set up to negotiate commercial treaties with various countries.      The Commission undertook toinform His Majesty&apos; s Ambassador very shortly of the date whenthey would be ready to receive a delegation from the Uniteddngdom for this purpose,      In the meantime,   steps arc being takenhone to form a delegation and to provide it with the necessary material,  and the Commercial Counsellor to His Majesty&apos;s Embassyhas arrived in London to assist in these preparations.gPYFT28.    The Egyptian Government show signs of reviving their-&quot; quest that His Majesty&apos;3 Government should guarantee the  saleof the whole of the cotton crop.      The question of underwritingsome portion of the crop unsold through war measures is still under consideration, but  it has not yet been found possible toll-fine the scope of any such relief pending examination of its^Plications elsewhere,IRAN29.    The interruption of trade with Germany and someintr ansigenc0/

intransigence on the part of Russia are causing Iran greatconcern and His Majesty&apos;s Government will not improbably be faced with the usual claims on their purse in order to avertpolitical discontent.pAHjASpT30-    Evidence is growing that efforts to supply Germanythrough Russian agency cannot be ignored.      Difficulties ofsupply? of transport and of payment will provide a naturalcheck on the volume of this assistance, but the difficultyof control by His Majesty&apos;s Government is very real,31.    The difficulties experienced by Chile as the resultof the dislocation of trade caused by the war are becomingacute, and the  question of an agreement with the chilean government to mitigate those difficulties is now underconsideration.Contraband Control32.    During the seven days from the 22nd to the 28thOctober, 133 new cases of ships were considered by the Contrabandcommittee and M8 eases of ships previously detained for enquirywere reviewed in the light of information obtained as a resultof such enquiries as to the destination of their cargoes.33-    During this period 3 cargoes were wholly seized and81 wholly released.      In 29 cases part cargoes were seized andother consignments released either unconditionally or,  in somecases (in order to release as much shipping as possible),  subjectto the undertaking of the shipowners to hold certain items of the cargoes at the disposal of the Ministry pending the result of enquiries as to their ultimate destination.        In order not toretain ships for longer than absolutely necessary,  in 7 casesQf neutral ships in which the  items of cargo detained for enquiry&quot;ere small (both in number and bulk) permission was given for theseoems to be landed in this country in order to permit of shipscontinuing their voyages without further delay.
