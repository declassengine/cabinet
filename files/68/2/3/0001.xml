(R) (39) 16,)The accompanying report shows the position with regard to the supply and production of the main items of Royal Air Force equipment at the 30thSeptember, 1939*K.W.Air Ministry, S.W.1.TO  BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.

9 9*MONTHLY REPORT i^^JLm^JfflM:QN SUPPLY .AND PRODUCTION.Aircraft.1.       The output of aircraft during the month ofSeptember 1939 was 892 as compared with the plannedoutput of 768.2.       The War Cabinet have approved the Air Ministry&apos;sproposals for achieving a production of 2.200- aircraft amonth in this country by the third year of war.      This new programme (in which is included the production of largenew types of bomber aircraft and new types of fighter)necessarily involves large increases in productivecapacity over the whole range of aeronautical supplies and large additional orders to maintain continuity ofproduction at the expanded rates of output.3*       A review of the detailed requirements of thenew programme from these aspects has begun, and provisional plans have already been prepared for four newairframe factories at Speke, Stoke, Doncaster andPrestwick.      The Speke factory will use, to a largeextent, factory buildings already existing and two ofthese have already been leased,     Additional requirementsof floor space - which will undoubtedly necessitate theerection of further factories - are under activeinvestigation.     Detailed plans have also been formulatedand approved for the establishment of a new factory atAccrington for the production of Bristol aer-o-engines.It should be mentioned in this connection that this increase in the demands made upon the managing resourcesof the Bristol Aeroplane Company (who,  in addition tomanaging already a largely expanded factory themselves,

u wmust collaborate very closely with nine Shadow factoriesmanaged by other firms) has involved a change in the plans for the production of a Bristol type of engine in Australia-It has been proposed to the Commonwealth Government thatengines for the General Reconnaissance aircraft to beproduced in the Dominion should be supplied from thiscountry until such time as the Australian industry is in production on a suitable type of engine of American design,for the production of which a certain amount of experiencealready exists in the Dominion.h.       A detailed examination has also been begun ofthe additional orders which it will be necessary to place with the various firms to achieve the higher rates of out-put required and, in the period under review, additionalorders have, as a preliminary step, been placed in thiscountry for approximately 2,000 airframes and 3*000 engines.Further large orders will need to be placed in theimmediate future.Materials..5.        In the previous Air Ministry report(W.P. (R) (39)16), stress v/as laid on the fundamental importance of an adequate supply of materials for the new programme, and it was mentioned that larger supplies of aluminium from Canada would be essential.6.       Adequate supplies of aluminium in ample time are,  in fact, at the root of the successful implementation of the aircraft programme.      It is estimated that thetotal requirements of virgin aluminium for the aircraft programme will amount to 160,000 tons per annum towardswhich the following amounts may be available:    GreatBritain 25,000 tons, Switzerland 12,500 tons, Norway12,500 tons, U.S.A. 18,000 tons, Canada 60,000 tons,

Total 128,000 tons.      The reliability of some of thesesources is doubtful and there is,  in any case, a deficiency of 32,000 tons which can only be made good by such re-use as it may be possible to organise of scrap material and by increased production in Canada.      Urgent action to thisend is required and the Air Ministry are in consultationwith the Ministry of Supply.7*\      It is also necessary to increase very largelythe supply from Canada of spruce, which is required notonly for the manufacture of trainer aircraft but also, as was mentioned in the previous report, for the productionof a largo new type of bomber of wood and steel construe-&apos;tion.      The Ministry of Supply have therefore been askedto ensure that imports from the United States and Canadashould be increased from the present rate of about 3/35500standards a year to 6/8,000 standards a year by April 19^and 10/12,000 standards a year by July 19u1.Armament and Instruments.8.       An increase in the production of airframes and engines must, of course, be balanced by a corresponding increase in the production of armament and equipment.For this purpose two new factories have been planned and approved and erection will be started shortly for theproduction of automatic controls.      In order to increasethe security of the supply of radio valves, the greaterpart of which is at present produced in the London area, adisused cotton mill at Shaw, near Oldham, has been acquired as a now source of supply.Production in Canada.9.       Representatives of the Air Ministry have forsome time past been in Canada with Colonel Greenly1sMission investigating the possibility of increasing

6 3supplies from the Dominion and they have been fullyinstructed with regard to Air Ministry requirements,These arc, briefly, that supply of aircraft for trainingpilots in Canada should take first place and that, subjectto this qualification, efforts should be concentrated onthe production of a new type of large bomber and a fighter aircraft (arrangements for the production ofwhich had already been made before the outbreak of war)and,  in addition, on an Army Co-operation machine whichis, in fact, at present being produced for the canadian government.      Instructions have recently been issued tothe group of firms set up in Canada last year Cor the manufacture of. Aircraft, for the Royal Air Force to jig andtool within a total expenditure of two million dollars forthe production of the bomber aircraft in question.      Thepossibility of manufacturing in Canada a large number ofinstruments and other items of equipment - of v/hichdetails have been given to the Mission - will also be investigated.      These requirements have also been includedin a comprehensive memorandum v/hich has been prepared forthe Riverdale Mission and includes a statement of plans for the provision of trainer aircraft of all types for theexpanded scheme for training pilots in Canada.Supplies from U.S.A..10.      The assurance of supplies from the UnitedStates is of great importance for the air programme, notonly as regards the supply of trainer and general reconnaissance aircraft Which arc already on order, but inall probability for a portion of the trainers which willbe required for the future training of pilots in Canada,subject to the provision of finance.      The most importantsupplies required from this source are, however, machine

tools to supplement production in the United Kingdom.Arrangements have further &quot;been made to purchase from america, as soon as revision of the United StatesNeutrality Legislation will permit, 1,200 Wright Cycloneengines, while orders are being placed for the manufacture in the United States of 2,000 crankshafts for Rolls-Royce,,-engines to be manufactured in this country.Works Programme.11.      The whole programme,of works for the Royal AirForce was reviewed as a matter of course after the out-break of war;    all new items not essential for the prosecution of the war have been eliminated, and wherever possible economics are being effected in the type of construction.So far as the information at the disposal ofthe Air Ministry shows, there is sufficient material andlabour (without encroaching on the urgent requirements ofthe other Service Departments) to enable the revised programme of works to be completed according to scheduleand allow the expanding Porce to operate at fullefficiency.      This is subject, of course,  to any over-riding decisions on priority which may be made necessary by sudden emergency.Summary *12. Aircraft.(a) Output during September was 892 compared withthe planned output of 768 (paragraph 1).(b) Requirements of new productive capacity for theincreased programme are being investigated andalready provisional plans have been preparedfor four airframe factories, and plans havebeen approved for an additional aero-enginefactory (paragraphs 2 and 3)*

6 i(c) Orders have boon placed,  as a first instalment,for approxLmatcly 2,000 airframes and 3,000engines (paragraph A),.Materials*(a) 160,000 tons of aluminium per annum will &quot;berequired for the new programme:    128,000 tonsof this (not all from reliable sources) willprobably be available, and the balance willhave    to be obtained by increased productionin Canada and the possible recovery of scrap.The Air Ministry arc in touch with theMinistry of Supply on this matter (paragraphs and 6)0(b) Arrangements have been made to increase importsof spruce (paragraph 7) *Armament and Instruments&quot;The oalane;&apos;;:.   of productive capacity forarmament and instruments with productive capacity for aircraft is under review (paragraph 8)0Production in^jJanada.A comprehensive report has been prepared forthe Riverdale Mission indicating the requirements of air-frames, instruments and equipment which the Air Ministrydesire to obtain from Canada (paragraph 9)*Supplies from U.SJUThe most important supplies required from theUnited States are machine tools.      Aircraft, aero-engines and engine parts arc also desired (paragraph 10-).
