n0CANADA,(l) General Position.The Canadian Parliament met on the 7th September,  and,after two days&apos; debate, voted without amendment an address inreply to the Speech from the Throne in favour of CanadianI participation in the war.     A Proclamation was issued on the 10thISeptember declaring the existence of a state of war between canada and. Germany as from that date,(2) Naval, Military and Air Activities.General Policy.In his speech in the Canadian Parliament on the 9thSeptember the Prime Minister of Canada defined the main alias ofCanada&apos;s defence policy as(a) the defence of Canada&apos;s coast and her own internal security;(b) the safety of the main trade routes, particularly thatI debouching from the St. Lawrence, for which purpose the integrity of Newfoundland and Labrador, with the neighbouring Frenchpossessions, was essential;(cj     measures of economic co-operation (including the pre-vention of trade with enemy countries);(d)     the expediting of air training facilities in Canada.Navy.In response to a suggestion that the six destroyers ofthe Royal Canadian Navy might be placed under Admiralty orders,theCanadian Government have stated that the destroyers would beaUihorized to work in close co-operation with the Royal Navy,The Canadian Government are taking  steps for the fittingI   oi vessels as armed merchant cruisers, defensively equippedchant ships and mine sweeping vessels.      They are also considering

considering the possibility of building anti submarine and mine-sweepirg vessels, provided that armament and constructionpersonnel could be lent from the United Kingdom.Progressive enlistment of naval personnel up to double the existing strength is being undertaken,  ana stores are beinginpreaed.Army.The Canadian Government have announced their decisionto proceed with the organization of a division to be available asan expeditionary force if and when required.      Men now enlistedwill be permitted to volunteer for active service in Canada or elsewhere and will be reattested on this basis.      A second division will similarly be reattested and kept under arms as afurther measure of preparedness.The Canadaian Government have also stated that they are ready to despatch technical units,  to a total of from 5,000 to6,000 of all ranks, as Canadian units for whose pay and transportCanada will be responsible,  if the United Kingdom government can provide ecpuipment,,Air.The Canadian Government at an early stage intimatedtheir readiness to expand training facilities with a view to providing the maximum possible number of trained pilots, observers,air gunners, etc.      They have also accepted in principle the air training Scheme announced by the Secretary of State for Air inthe House of Commons on the 10th October.    Under this scheme,  itis contemplated that some 50 additional flying training schools,25 for elementary training and 25 for advanced training, would0e established in oversea parts of the Empire,      The elementary schools would be established, partly in Canada and partly inAustralia and New Zealand, while the advanced schools would, be concentrated



concentrated in Canada. The advanced schools in Canada -wouldbe available for training not only pupils from Canada but alsopupils who have completed elementary training in the United King(from, Australia and hew Sbaland,      rare of  i;he necessary aircraft could be supplied from the United Kingdom- v.bieh would also subplinstructors,   but there would be a large demand for aircraftmanufactured in Canada or obtained from elsewhere.      A mission from the United Kingdom headed by Lord Riverdale is new in Canadito discuss the detailed working out of the scheme with theCanadian authorities and with Missions from Australia and NowZealand which will be arriving in Canada early in November,.(3) Legislative Ac tion.The Canadian Government have issued Regulations dealingvrith various matters relating to the war,  including trading withthe enemy,  control of imports and exports and exchange controlsThey have also established a postal and telegraph censorship,and the Canadian Censorship authorities are co-operating closely with the authorities in this country.(4) Economic Action.The Canadian Government&apos;s co-operation,  once wzr start ain regard to supplies of finished munitions,  including aircraft and raw materials, was prompt and whole-hearted.      At an early stage they set up a Canadian War Supply Board for their own purposes, and they have since made the services of this bodyavailable without charge to the United Kingdom munitionsPurchasing Mission,  the nucleus of which was on its way to canada under Sir James Rae when war started.      The Mission has since been increased, and Cclonel Greenly    is new in charge.    as already stated, a Mission to deal with the Air Training Schemeand with the supply of aircraft for the scheme has also arrived in Canada under Lord Riverdale.    It is contemplated that all

purchases to be made by both Missions will be placed with canadian contractors through the Canadian War Supply Board.    Thereis every indication that, under the stimulus of the canadian government&apos;s own requirements and those of the United Kingdom,Canadian industry is gearing up to the maximum effort in theminimum time.It is possible that further United Kingdom representatives will be sent to Canada,   in association with the Greenly &apos; PurchasingMission,  in connection with United Kingdom requirements in respect01&quot; certain raw materials and foodstuffs.      Negotiations for these commodities have hitherto taken place in London, largely with thelocal representatives of Canadian interests.The Commodity at present arousing most attention is wheat.  Inthis case the Canadian Government have pressed the United kingdom authorities very strongly to make purchases on a large scale, butit has not been thought possible to do this so long as the WinnipegGrain Exchange continues to operate on an ostensibly normal basis.It had. been hoped that on the outbreak of war the Canadian Scverii-meht should close the Exchange, but this they have not felt able to dofor political reasons,  and it has been found that tentative attemptson the part of the United Kingdom authorities to enter the wheatmarket have led to marked fluctuation in prices to a point v/hich bringsthem out of line with prices elsewhere.      The Canadian Prime Minister,who has frequently sent messages to the Prime Minister0n   this    subject,   is being informed that,  subject to theCanadian Wheat Board endeavouring to maintain a reasonable and steadyprice,  day-to-day purchases will be begun.

In view of the exchange difficulties, finance overshadowsall the United Kingdom&apos;s requirements of Canada.      Mr.  Osbome,of the Bank of England, has no;? been co-operating as theTreasury&apos;s representative in Canada with the Canadian Governmentfor over a fortnight.      His reports show that the canadian authorities are disposed to be helpful and the first fruits oftheir co-operation in this sphere have taken the form of adecision to repatriate the 137 million dollar loan domiciled inEngland.4A.

COMMONWEALTH OP AUSTRALIA.1. General PositioncA War Cabinet consisting of six members of theCabinet has been formed.In September a Budget was introduced which included 35,137,000 for defence purposes,  of which rather more than 12,000,000 will be obtained from: revenue and the remainderfrom additional taxation.

Australian Military Forces.,All District Base Defence  Schemes are in full operation and local defence for Ports Kembla, Moresby andDarwin have been arranged or increased.The Militia is being mobilised in two batches of40,000.      Each will have one month&apos;s continuous training inconcentration areas close to coastal sectors to be defendedin case of attack.A special force (ages 20 to 55)  of 20,000 is being-raised for service in Australia or overseas.      Thus by theend of November,  1939, a force of 100,000 will be available,all of whom will have had at least one month&apos;s trainingsIn addition an Army Reserve is being formed of ex-A. I.Ib. menand of Militia men over 45 years for service  in Australia,If employed outside Australia, further equipment and some months of further training will be needed.Royal Australian Air Force.The R.A.A.F.  comprises 13 operational squadrons,  ofwhich 8 are regular squadrons and 4 are cadre squadrons;the latter are composed of about l/3rd regular and 2/3rds citizeforce.

The commonwealth government has stated the extent of the assistance which theycan offer to this country.     The chief items include fieldgun, light Howitzer and light Naval gun ammunition,  smoke floatsparavanes, air bombs, and grenades, high angle guns, machine guns and rifles, but the assistance of the United kingdom would be required in supplying certain raw materials andtextiles.Aircraft.The present small programme of aircraft construction in Australia, amounting to about 60 aircraft,  dees not providefor more than is needed for the immediate necessities of theR.A.A.-F.    Consequently it offers no exportable surplus.    Inaddition the programme for the manufacture of Beauforts which wedrawn

drawn up as a result.lt of the visit earlier  chis year of an air Mission from the United Kingdom;, will eventually provideabout ISO, or approximately 2/5rds cf the total construction programme.    ho date can yet be given, however,  as to when this programme will be completed,.Foodstuffs.Negotiations have been, proceeding between commonwealth and United Kingdom representatives by which,  cub,loot tomutually acceptable prices and conditions,  the Una bed KingdomGovernment will for the duration of the war take seme or all of Australia&apos;s surplus production in wheat, butter,cheese, eggs,  dried fruits, canned fruits, beef, mutton-,lamb and pig meats.Raw Material,By mutual agreement arrangements have been made for&apos;the sale to the United Kingdom Government of the Australianwool clip and of all available non-ferrous metals.Other Materials;There have also been some special shipments toGreat Britain of Australian steel and galvanised corrugatediron.      The tonnage has been considerable, but these transactions, although they could, be repeated, are not covered by long term contract arrangements.
