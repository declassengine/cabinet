c1 u ,a 0IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMEHfl^C R E...,T^Copy No.WAR cabinet home FRONT REPORT N0..1First&apos; Renort: submitted by-the, Lord JPrivy Sealcovering the period Prom the outbreak&apos;of- war toTilth&quot; OcTober,&quot; 195S .&quot;&quot;        &quot;OBJECT AND SCOPE OF REPORTS,;1.      The general object of the &quot;Home Front&quot; reports $  as I see it,  is to paint with a broad brush a picture of domesticconditions which will enable the Par Cabinet(a) to be regularly informed as to theconditions of civilian life not directly concerned with the prosecution of the war,and(b) to keep under review the administrationof the Public Services,  central and local,with a view to ensuring a proper balance between the prosecution of the war effort and the maintenance of efficient standards of administratIon,2.      Under the former of those heads,  the most importantsubjects which will call for the attention of the Par Cabinetarc  (i) the maintenance of morale,   (ii) unemployment and relief of distress,  and (iii) prices and cost of living.    TheHome Policy Committee has given some preliminary considerationto the last of these subjects but it will,  in future,  comeprimarily within the province of the Committee on economic policy.

9 nMAINTENANCE OF MORALE.3.      The fact that the war has not so far developed inaccordance with popular expectations makes it speciallyimportant to avoid the adoption of policies or the taking ofaction which are likely to have a depressing effect or to giverise to grievances which might impair the tenacity of purposeof the nation.      In every subject which has come before theHome Policy Committee,  careful consideration has been given tothe factor of morale.        The postitive side also has not beenoverlooked, and in particular I am consulting the Minister ofInformation with a view to submitting to the Prime Ministerproposals for a suitable programme of broadcast speeches by ministers .EMPLOYMENTh.     As the Minister of Labour&apos;s Reports have shown, theimmediate effect of the war has been to lead to some increaseof unemployment,  the persons mainly affected having been womenor boys 5  apart from certain classes Of workers such as those engaged in hotels,  theatres,  etc.      There is at present agreater number of persons seeking to be employed on work ofnational importance than the number of openings likely to beavailable in the near future,  and although it is to be antici-pated that the programmes of expansion of the Armed Forces willin due course absorb the whole,  or almost the whole,  of thosewho arc available,  there is bound to be a time lag.      Apartfrom the economic aspect of the question, persons who fail tofind an outlet for their desire for service are bound to loseheart if this time lag is too long,  and it is therefore ofgreat importance that all Departments concerned should treatsympathetically applications for employment and should make itclour&apos; to the applicants that their names are being recorded

RELIEF OF&apos; DISTRESS5.      Provision was made &quot;by the Unemployment Assistance(Emergency Powers) Act,  1939?  for extending the scope ofthe Unemployment Assistance Scheme to include almost allpersons over the age of 16 who arc in distress because,  owingto circumstances caused by the war,  either they themselves or persons on whom they are normally dependent for support have lost entirely, or to a substantial extent,  their normal meansof livelihood.      The provision made by this Act and by thenormal peace-time schemes for the unemployed and destitute will serve to relieve all or almost all cases of actual distress,but there remain a number of difficult questions as to whetherpersons whose circumstances have been affected by the war should be relieved of civil liabilities which they have under-taken and which they arc no longer in a position to carry out.These questions are at present being investigated by a Sub-Committee of the Home Policy Committee presided over by theLord Chancellor,  and it is probable that legislation will benecessary in the near future.SOCIAL services.      It is inevitable that war conditions should have a reaction on the standard of administrative efficiency of theSocial Services.      It is too soon yet to prepare any generalappreciation of the position but it as being carefully watchedby a Sub-Commit tee of the Homo Policy Commit00 ander theChairmanship of the Lord Chancellor and aay material changesin the situation will bo reported to the Y/ap (humnet in due course.7-      The most serious problem which has emerged so far hasbeen that of providing for the education of the large numberof children still remaining in evacuation areas  (in reception-3-

areas arrangements are in general working satisfactorily).      TheBoard, of Education have suggested to local education authoritiesarrangements,  short of opening the schools for instructions  forattending to the education, health and recreation of children inthese areas.      These arrangements are necessarily of the mostmakeshift character and will clearly prove inadequate if thepresent situation continues for a long time,      There is,unfortunately,  already evidence of some degree of demoralisationamong school children, and this condition seems inevitable solong as a large proportion of the children, remain in areas wherethe schools arc closed and where,  consequently,  the sense of discipline resulting from school attendance is lacking.      Thesituation in Scotland is generally the same as in England..8.      Owing to the inability in existing circumstances tomake adequate educational provision for children between lh and15, and of administering satisfactorily the procedure for granting exemptions,  the Education (Emergency) Bill was introduced suspending indefinitely the sections of the education act, 1936, which provide for the raising of the school age fromlh to 15,  and was passed.      A similar Act has been passed, forScotland.LEGISLATION AND DEFENCE REGULATIONS9-      The functions exercised in peace time by the Committeeof Home Affairs in regard to the examination of proposals for legislation are being carried out now by the Home PolicyCommittee,  to which proposals for new Regulations under theEmergency Powers  (Defence) Act,  1939,  are also submitted.MISCELLAI-IFOUS.10.      Requisitioning of Hotels and Offices.    Some dis-satisfaction has been caused by the extent to which hotels and offices have been requisitioned- by various Government Departments-4-

This matter is being examined, by a Sub-Committee under theChairmanship of the First Commissioner of Works.      The home policy Committee have instructed the Sub-Ccmmi11ee to proceed on the assumption that broadly speaking there should be norequisitioning of hotels or schools or large business premisesexcept for the purpose of office accomraodation, and in particularthat premises of this nature should not be requisitioned by theService Departments for billeting.11.      Local Government Elections.    A Bill has been introduced to suspend the holding of Local Government elections during thewar, as was done in 191U-1918.      Any casual vacancies will be filled by co-option.    The Bill also provides for this year&apos;sRegister of Parliamentary and Local Government Electors rcmain-ing in force until such date as Parliament nay determine.12.      Summer Time.      In accordance with the decision of theWar Cabinet on 20th September  (W.M. (39) 21st. conclusions minute 17) a Regulation has boon made under the Emergency Powers(Defence) Act extending the period of Summer Time until the lothNovember .1-3-      Football Pools .    In vie&quot;,/ of the strain which wouldhave been imposed on the Postal Staff if Football Pools had been resumed,  the Postmaster General was authorised by the Home PolicyCommittee to request the Pool Promoters not to resume theoperation of the Pools.      The Promoters agreed not to resumeheir operations in their original form but they have sincesubmitted to the Postmaster General certain alternative proposals which are being examined.FUTURE REPORTS.IP,      It was originally contemplated that Reports on theHome Front should be submitted to the War Cabinet at monthly intervals but I am inclined to doubt whether it is necessary

or desirable to submit them sc frequently.      Individual mattersof sufficient importance are brought to the notice of the WarCabinet from time to time either by requests for decisions on policy or in the separate Reports submitted,  for example, bythe Minister of Labour and the minister of Information.      If,as I think,  the general Home Front Report should concentrate onthe painting of a broad picture and the indication of tendencies,I would suggest that it would be sufficient for the Reports tobe submitted at intervals of two months.-   -  - S.
