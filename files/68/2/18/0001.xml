THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC WIAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1939.SECRET. Copy No.   ^DW.P/(39) -9T.TO  BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK AND  KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.PUBLICITY IN ENEMY COUNTRIES.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a report submitted by Sir Campbell Stuarton the work of the Department of Publicity in Enemy Countries, covering theperiod the 8th October to the 22nd October, 1939.H.October 26, 1939.ENEMY PROPAGANDA.(Report by Sir Campbell Stuart, G.C.M.G.. K.B.E.)ON the 8th October I had the honour to submit a report which covered thework of my Department to that date. Since then there have been a number of developments which it is now my duty to record. Progress has, moreover, been maintained along all the normal lines of activity.Leaflets.Distribution by the Royal Air Force has continued to be intermittent, only two propaganda flights having been made. During the week before last twoleaflets, the first containing the final passages of the Prime Minister&apos;s speech of the 11th October, and the second a summary of the whole pronouncement, wereprinted. About one and a half million of the former have been disseminatedin Germany. In addition to the stock now in the hands of the Royal Air Force,a number of other leaflets have been drafted, and are being held in readiness for printing when required. Meanwhile, work has proceeded in connexion withcertain secret channels with which I am concerned. It may be added that recentreports upon the effect of British leaflets, and particularly of those which have dealt with the smuggling by Nazi leaders of funds abroad, have been most encouraging, criticism0coming chiefly from those who condemn the leaflet because it is not a bomb.Balloons.It should be remembered that in addition to aircraft as an agency of distribution, we have in France a large and increasing number of leaflet-carryingballoons.   They are the outcome of a decision taken some time before the war,10654   [20196]
and in the light of my own experience of the valuable pail balloons played inthe propaganda of 1918. Our balloons are made of doped cotton fabric, andinflate to a diameter of nine or ten feet. At ten thousand feet their enduranceis about twelve hours. Height is maintained by the automatic dropping at intervals of leaflet ballast. The balloons are fitted with devices which ensure thatwhen their work is accomplished, they will explode. Bach balloon carriesapproximately three thousand leaflets, and the existing stock of them and rateof production are now sufficient to enable the Balloon Unit to operate continuouslyduring favourable weather periods at a rate of four hundred balloons a week there were initial flights by some sixty balloons at the beginning of the month.Hitherto the policy of my Department has been to regard the balloons as onlyto be used when for tactical or other reasons aircraft may not be available.Broadcasts.Active collaboration with the B.B.C. in the preparation of broadcast talks in German, Czech, and within the last few days Polish, has continued as an addition to the news in those languages. One of these talks, an appeal to theformer spirit of the German army, with special reference to the death ofGeneral von Fritsch. was prepared and delivered by a member of the Departmentsstaff. It has elicited numerous tributes from this country and abroad, and isreported from France to have made a dee]) impression in Germany. Other talksof a similar type will follow.Evidence as to the reactions of these talks in Germany will necessarily heless complete than that from non-enemy countries. It is, nevertheless, enoughto show that reasonably satisfactory effect has been produced. Furthermore, anew feature in the form of occasional broadcasts addressed specially to theAustrian people has been introduced.It may be added that the strengthening of the B.B.C. service referred toin my last report has now been introduced. The result is that listeners mi thecontinent now receive the B.B.C. messages very much more loudly than the1,did in the first weeks of the war.Relations with the Press.The decision that my Department should be transferred from the Ministryof Information to the Foreign Office took effect from the 17th October. As I now fall under the S.I.S. vote. I have naturally been concerned lest the pressmight raise objection to the greater secrecy it is now prepared to observe i therefore felt that I should endeavour to secure understanding and approval ofthe new policy on the part of the principal newspaper proprietors of this country.Consequently I arranged for a private meeting. As a result of a very sat is factoryconversation, it was agreed to establish an informal committee with which Ipropose to confer at regular intervals.Prisoners of War.During the period now under review, I have been consulted by the War office in regard to obtaining information from prisoners of war and civil internees inthis country. My Department has furnished the information sought, and hasmade a number of suggestions.German Refugees in Great Britain.In my last report I covered at some length the relations of my Departmentwith German refugee organisations and individuals. It is, therefore, only,necessary to add that an organisation is being established with the object ofmaintaining touch with all political refugees from Germany wdio are in thiscountry, and of selecting those most likely to be of use in an advisory capacity.Further, I intend that my Department shall keep in close touch with such of tin&apos;selected refugees as are likely to be helpful.I have also investigated the possibility of making use of an organisation olAustrian refugees which has succeeded&apos;in maintaining touch with politicalgroups of many complexions in Austria, and have satisfied myself that they canbe employed for certain propaganda purposes of a secret nature, and for elicithiginformation.
Activities in Neutral Countries.My Department concerned with approaches to Germany through neutral countries and the collection of information from&apos;that country has already securedniatter of considerable value, and as a result I am developing my activities inthis direction on a wide scale. At a later date I hope to be able to reportmore fully-Co-operation tuith the Forces in France.At the end of last week I returned from a visit to France, which I am happy to report has led to valuable results. After preliminary discussions with the WarOffice, and later with General Headquarters. I have arranged that my Depart-ment will be represented by an office!&apos; attached to the British Directorate ofMilitary Intelligence in France. His duties will generally be to act as liaison between the British and French Land Forces in the field. In particular, he isto ensure that the Director of Military Intelligence be provided with all relevant information in regard both to the policy and machinery of enemy propaganda.At the same time, he will co-operate with the French enemy propaganda officerat Grand Quartier General in order to exchange information on all matterscalculated to promote the efficient conduct of operations.An appointment of this kind was necessary in order to enable propaganda to be directed against the front-line enemy troops. For some time past myDepartment has carefully considered both the nature of this propaganda, andthe machinery to be employed in distributing it. For obvious reasons the formerwill differ in some respects from that of propaganda addressed to the Germanpeople as a whole. Certain facts and arguments, such as the retention of theyoung men of the S.S. and S.A. to dragoon the civil population of Germany, will,no doubt, make a special appeal to enemy troops. In the case, moreover, of front-line propaganda, it will be possible to check results, and to adapt policy with much greater rapidity than is possible in the present circumstances. Moreover,a far wider choice of agencies of distribution will be possible. Trench warfareallows of the use of trench and projectile loud speakers, propaganda rockets andguns. Another means of reaching the enemy troops is by leaflets left by patrolsin No Man&apos;s Land.Co-ordination of British and French Broadcasting.Ever since I was asked in September 1988 to interest myself in plans for enemy propaganda. I have been convinced of the necessity for co-ordinatingBritish and French broadcasting, in so far as it is to be directed towards our foes.My later experiences have only served to strengthen this conviction. No otherchannel of propaganda leads more directly or more swiftly to the enemy, and noneis so far-reaching in its range. In my last report I gave some of the reasons which led me to believe that our broadcasts in German were being heard alike by german civilians and by troops in the field. I have since received further evidence. even when the Gestapo are most active, listening seems to continue. I learn, forinstance, that headphones are eagerly sought after in Germany, and the practiceof keeping one wireless set blaring for the benefit of the police while a member ofthe family listens in bed to another set is not infrequent. There is also. I am told,a certain amount of listening to our ordinary broadcasts in English.Technical Considerations.On investigating, at the request of the Air Ministry and the B.B.C., andwith the full approval of the Foreign Office, the possibilities of Anglo-french -operation, I found that it would, as a preliminary, depend largely on certain technical engineering factors. These require to be stated briefly before theproblem as a whole is explained. The British authorities, as the result of pro-longed expert discussions between the Air Ministry and the B.B.C., had, beforethe outbreak of war, decided on a plan by which broadcasting could be conducted with full regard to national security. Broadcasting stations before the warworked as engineering units independently of one another, thus allowing themaximum of variety in programmes. It was agreed that such variety must be sacrificed in time of war, to ensure that no assistance be given to enemy aircraft.A wireless station, when it sends out programmes on its own. acts as a guidingbeacon to raiding aircraft. This danger is eliminated by arranging stations ingroups all using the same wavelength. The principle thus adopted is technicallyknown as &quot; synchronisation.&quot;
The Position in France.The French authorities had not given the same attention to this problem as had the British, and it was learnt in the summer that no plan for arranging the French stations in synchronisation had been evolved. The danger of thislack was that it imperilled French continuity in broadcasting, because in theabsence of a plan of synchronisation there is no alternative, when air raids begin to the abrupt shutting down of all French stations. When a plan of synchronisa-tion is working and an air-raid warning is given, all that is necessary fromthe point of view of security is to shut down any station within fifty miles of enemy aircraft. This means that, since all the other stations in the group continueworking, listeners are still able to hear programmes over almost the whole; of thecountry.The alternative when there is no plan is either to run the risk of helpingenemy aircraft or to cut off immediately and abruptly, in the middle of a pn gramme, all stations throughout the country, however remote they may he fromthe scene of attack. In present circumstances, not only France, but also largeparts of England are open to more easy air attack. For broadcasting, at anyrate in Northern France, is as useful to enemy raiders attacking England asis English broadcasting. Even if, in the absence of intensive air-raiding, atemporary relaxation of the severe synchronising plan were permitted in GreatBritain, .it would still remain essential to have such a plan in France, as inGreat Britain, ready and in reserve for immediate execution.Broadcasting Progress in France.In view of the above, I took the matter up personally with the french authorities, and I am glad to say that considerable progress has now been made.The French have agreed in principle to adopt a plan of synchronisation, andhave purchased from the British authorities some of the necessary equipment which can only be supplied speedily from this side of the Channel. The wireless stations in the north of France are already working in a synchronised group.There has, however, in the last week, been a serious hitch in this pro-gramme. It was learnt that an obsolete station at Fecamp, controlled by theInternational Broadcasting Company (of which Captain L. F. Plugge, M.P., isthe chairman), has been modernised, and had started to work with programmes in English, Czech and Austrian. The danger of allowing a station so near theChannel to work on its own without an) synchronising precautions was felt bythe Air Ministry to be grave. My officers, again at the request of the AirMinistry, have, in the last few days, made representations to the French service authorities, who are in complete agreement with the British point of view, andhave confessed that the private interests concerned in France have got the ear ofthe civil powers without reference to factors of national security. It is hopedthat the French Service view will shortly prevail. There remains much technicalwork to be done before the French system can be regarded as satisfactory, butthe necessary machinery has now been established, and is working smoothly.Printing in France.At an early stage it became clear that considerable advantages were to be gained by arranging with the French authorities for supplementary printingfacilities on their side of the Channel. The advantages to be looked for werethreefold. First, when the necessary R.A.F. units are in France it may from timeto time become more practical for them to be able to collect their bulk loads onthe spot. Secondly, the desirability of having printing works scattered so as toavoid the danger of confusion following air attack is obvious. Thirdly, printingworks in France might provide a more convenient base for the distribution of leaflets intended for German troops on the Western front. The french authorities have been most helpful in this matter. Following my las! visit-arrangements have been made by which orders may be placed for the immediateprinting at any time in France of a million leaflets, and, if at a later date require-ments on a much larger scale are necessary, the French are able and willing toundertake the work.
