-2-tonnage. The Norwegian Government have asked that discussions regarding the main heads of a War trade agreement should he hegun in Oslo. It has not yetbeen decided whether to agree to this suggestion orto ask the Norwegian Government to send a delegationhere .DENMARK5.      No further progress has been made in connectionwith a V/ar Trade Agreement,      Certain conversations havetaken place with the Danish Minister here.6.     Danish trade with England has been resumed and ships are now running normally,  although no definiteundertakings have been given by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto Denmark with regard to Danish/German trade.FINLAND7.     A preliminary meeting with the finnish government Representative took place on the 17th October.The principles of a War Trade Agreement based on the projected Anglo-Swedish War Trade Agreement were discussed.8.      Despite enemy threats., eight ships carryingwood pulp have recently arrived from Finland in theUnited Kingdom.ICELAND9.

?,ALTIC STATES10. ESTONIA:The Estonian Legation have informed theMinistry that the cost of transporting &quot;butter fromEstonia to the United Kingdom via Sweden amounts to27/6d. per cwt. as against 3/9d. per cwt. &quot;before thewar.      This would make future exports prohibitive.11.  OTHER BALTIC STATES:Nothing to report.BELGIUM12.      The Belgian delegates are returning toLondon to resume negotiations for a War Trade Agreement.The first meeting with the Belgian delegates has been fixed for Tuesday, 20th October.NETHERLANDS13.      There are indications of a more reasonableframe of mind on the part of the Netherlands Government,who have now informed us that they are ready to proceed at once with negotiations for a War Trade Agreement.Negotiations are to open on the 2htb October,lh.      The Netherlands Government continue their refusal to grant export licences for certain commoditiesurgently required in this country.      It would seem thatthis refusal is due to a genuine fear of a shortageat a later date.BALKAN and DANUBIAN STATES15.      The Department is now engaged on thepreparatory work for War Trade negotiations with Greece.The question of the expediency of opening negotiationswith Hungary and Roumania is under consideration.PORTUGAL/

16.      The Commercial Secretary to His Majesty&apos;aEmbassy at Lisbon has been recalled to England for consultation.      The Economic Advisor to the portuguese government informed him before he left Lisbon thathis Government were anxious to conclude an agreement which v/ould be in the best interests of both countries.SPAIN17.      The Minister for Foreign Affairs has expressed his earnest desire for the immediateconclusion of a War Trade Agreement with us.     HisExcellency admitted that any blame for the delay wason the Spanish side.      He regarded such negotiations and the trade which v/ould result therefrom as the best means of improving the relations between the twocountries, and welcomed the idea of a visit from aBritish trade delegation as soon as possible.Sir M. Peterson, however, wishes to satisfy himselfthats before the British trade delegation proceeds to madrid, the officials with whom the experts v/ould haveto negotiate are really ready to begin discussions.As Spaniards are never in a   hurry,  this may, therefore,not be for two or three weeks.ITALY18.      The negotiations with the Italian Governmenthave been temporarily suspended during the last weekwhile the representative of the Ministry has been inLondon for consultation with the other Departmentsconcerned with the questions of contraband controland purchases from and sales to Italy.19.      His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, who had reportedthat the German Government were making every effort to profit/

to profit from this delay, has now been informed thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government accept the principle of theagreement suggested by the Italian Government for thecreation of an Anglo-Italian Standing Committee.The representative of the Ministry has now returnedto Rome with an alternative draft to that proposed bythe Italian Government and with instructions to presson with the negotiations.

Meanwhile immediate action isbeing taken for the purchase of a    large quantity ofhemp.EGYPT20.      The question of the purchase by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of the entire Egyptian cotton crop for political reasons, which at one moment appeared to besettled in principle,   is now under discussion again.21.      Measures for tightening up the EgyptianExport Licensing system are under consideration inconsultation   with the Board of Trade.FAR EAST22.      A proposal is being submitted to the cabinet for the exercise of some sort of control over theimportation of contraband by Russia;    but no control which can be imposed by Great Britain is likely tobe completely water-tight, because in general it willnot be possible to check imports through Vladivostok.U.S.A. gri SOUTH AMERICA23.      Nothing to report.
