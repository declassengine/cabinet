(lTIIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC IILJESTY&apos;S (X) VERMONT)SECRETgAR CABINSTCIVIL DEFENCE REPORT NO. 7.Seventh Report submitted by the Ministerof Home Security covering the period from midnight 29th October to addninht 12th November, 1959.(Provious Report: Paper No. W.P.  (R) (39) 63)Enemy Air Attack.1.   Reconnaissance aircraft off the East Coast, notably Kent, gave rise to &quot;preliminary caution11 warning messages (yellow) on the 2nd, 3rd,5th, 8th and 10th November; and an extensive reconnaissance apparentlyby one aeroplane on the 10th November caused &quot;preliminary caution&quot; messagesin nine Regions.   No air raid warning signals (red) were issued.Air Raid Precaution Services.2.   The review of the local organiss.tion by Regional Commissioners,on the lines laid down in the recent circular *   is proceeding.3.   Reduction in the numbers of whole-time personnel involves agreater reliance upon part-time unpaid volunteers and tlds ha.s raised the question of the reimbursement to such volunteers for loss of wages due toattendance on Civil Defence duties during their working hours. A conference has been held with the Joint Committee of Employers&apos; Organisations v/ithwhom   it has been agreed that a part-time volunteer who is at his work whenthe air raid warning sounds, or when he receives a summons from the localauthority, can only leave his employment v/ith the consent of his employer,and secondly that, if he is on A.R.P. duty outside his working hours whenthe air raid warning sounds, he should complete that duty notwithstanding that this may involve his inability to go to his work at the normal time.As a matter of gencro.1 principle the employers expressed themselves asunwilling to reimburse workpeople for loss of wages if they were not ontheir premises during the time for which the loss of wages was claimed.Proposals for dealing v/ith this matter are being laid before the Treasury.Lighting Restrictions.4-.   Detailed improvements in industrial lighting have been settled asthe x-result of examins.tion of special places about which there were complain4e.g. Liverpool docks and railway marshalling yards.Referred to in Civil Defence Report No. 6, paragraph 2.W.P.

*5 ni -)0 ro 05o    In addition, as the result of consultation between theDepartment and the Air Staff, a senior representative of the Air Staff,who attended tho first meeting of the National Joint Advisory Councilconvert&quot;)! by the Minister of Labour was able to announce that the AirStaff were agreeable to the black-out time beginning at half-an-hourafter sunset and terminating half-an-hour before sunriseo    Ibis ineffect gives industrial establishments liberty to have unrestrictedartificial lighting for another hour if a-rtificial lighting is required.The concession is particularly important to industries which normallyonly work on daytime shift without overtimeo   Pith the shortening ofdaylight during the winter months either working time would have had tobe shortened or the firms concerned, eBgu textiles and printing firms,Would have had to incur substantial capital expenditure on obscurationof lighting for the sake of a very short period of artificial lighting.The concession was very well received not only by tho representativesof these industries, but also by the ship-builders, and during the period under review the complaints from industrial establishments about theconsequences of existing restrictions have been greatly reduced.6o   The improvements in. the lighting of trains already authorisedare beginning to show themselves and will be extended.    improvements in the interior lighting of buses and trams can bo expected as the resultof experiments being conducted between the Department and the Ministryof Transport and the operatorso7o   Experiments continue to be made in an attempt to find a street lighting of low intensity which will give more comfort to pedestrians.Although it is too early to speak with confidence, it appears possible thata lighting of lower intensity than, that used in the experiment on theGreat West Road may stand the necessary test from the air.    This testwill be undertaken, if weather conditions permit, in. the next few days.8a   Further experiments of a helpful character are being oonductedwith a view to permitting, at any rate during the period immediately preceding Christmas, lighting in shop windows which will not be reflectedoutside the windowo9.   Y/ith a view to reducing the number of casualties in the streetsduring the black-out a. Conference was held between the Minister of home security, and the Minister of Transport and a number of bodies includingthe A.A., R.A0C0 and Safety First Association, to discuss possible meansof reducing road casualties during black-out conoLitionsoAir Raid Warnings.10*    There have been one or two unimportant mechanical failuresin the air raid warning system and. a .\bw inevitable cases of mistakes, butgenerally the warning system has worked satisfactorilyo   Steps are howeverbeing taken to tighten up the.Yellow Caution, as its receipt by authorisedrecipients is being communicated too widely, and. in some cases action istaken on it as though it were the Red Warningo

9 A ^0 u JSuppljes.11*   Supplies and production have proceeded substantially accordingto programme.   Over 1,500*000 steel shelters had been delivered up tothe end of October, and there is still an unsatisfied demand, for aboutanother million.   A small proportion of the weekly production has been released for the Fighting Services.   During the last week there was anunexpected, drop in pi^oduction due to short supplies of some of thecomponents.    It is expected, however, that this decline will correctitself immediately.12.   There has not been time to test the public response to theoffer of a limited number of steel shelters for sale.   Figures receivedup to the present do not indicate any widespread waiting demands.   Thegeneral provision of shelter in the vulnerable areas is, on the whole,not unsatisfactory.   Hie steel shelters represent protection for over9*000,000 people.     Public shelter already provided covers a further2,000,000* and Work in hand on public shelters represents nearly amillion and a half.   Some of the areas which were most backward, e.g.Liverpool, and Glasgow, have latterly made much more satisfactory progress.13.   General progress is likely to be checked for a time by the drastic restrictions on the supply of timber which will come into force immediately.   Steel joists, etc., are not available as substitutes.On the other hand bricks and, to a slightly less extent, cement appearto be available in satisfactory quantities though there are temporarylocal shortages.   The shortage of timber v/ill affect trench shelterconstruction, though it is practicable for authorities to use concretelinings and the Department had, before the war, made an arrangement withthe Concrete Manufacturers&apos; Association for standard preoast concretelinings to be available.   These are in fact available in quantities inexcess of the current demand, but this demand is likely to be increased as the result of the shortage of timber.14.   Satisfactory progress is being made in the provision of shelterin industrial establishments.   Over 90fo of the occupiers of factorypremises had submitted their proposals for shelter three weeks beforethe statutory period of three months under the Act expired.   Over two-thirds of these proposals have already been approved, and others arebeing approved rapidly.   It is known that in a very large number ofcases progress is proceeding upon the construction of the shelters in anticipation of formal approval.   Protection has already been providedfor more than half of the 200,000 mine workers for whom it is required,and a substantial measure of protection has been secured for theremainder.Camouflage.15.   Of 1,700 essential factories which were asked urgently toreport progress in their camouflage programme, 33% have completed theirschemes, 30% are on the point of completion, and 25$ do not require

cassoufl&amp;ge protection. The remaining 12/6 are factories for which,in most cases, camouflage will probably not prove to he necessary,Eaorgency Fire Brigade MeasureSo16,    The settlement of the revised local Auxiliary Fire Servicewar establishments of whole-tine personnel is procoeding rapidly.About two-thirds of the establishments in Englend and Vfales have been settled.   So far, the reductions of paid personnel come to about,000,   On the other hand, in a few places, including some of the moreimportant oentres, increases of strength are urgently required.    Ifthese deficiencies can be made up, the net reduction in the establishmentalready dealt with v/ill be about i-,000 men, or 11 per cent,17,    The production and issue of equipment are proceeding satisfactorily, the deliveries of pumps averaging 500 per week,18,   Several large scale exorcises in tlxu concentration andhandling of large numbers of pumping units have been held successfully,more particularly in the London Region,Casualty Services,19,   On Sunday, November 12th, the number of vacant beds inEngland and Wales was approximately 160,000, a reduction of some10,000 in the fortnight.    This reduction has bean caused partly by thecontinued influx of normo.1 sick into hospital, and partly because thecomplete release from the Emergency Hospital Scheme of many of thesmaller and the class 2 hospitals is beginning to affect the figures.In Scotland the number of beds available for casualties continues tobe about 12,000,20*   Figures are being obtained at regular intervals of the bedsoccupied in the hospitals which make daily returns of empty bods, andthe latest figure in England and Wales is approximately 156,000,    this figure does not represent the whole hospital population which in mormal times is over 300,000 (excluding 157,000 in mental hospitals and institutions).   Daily bed   returns are not being obtained for all the institutions where in-patient medical treatment can be obtained but only from those to which casualties or general sick con. when necessary be sent21,    It now seems clear that there is no general restriction on the admission of patients to hospitals, although isolated hospitalsmay still be unable to admit as many as they would wish.   At a recent meeting of the Secretaries of the teaching hospitals it was stated thatat many of them waiting lists have never been so small owing to the pool of accommodation outside London which is enabling the hospitalsto admit patients quite freely and then to transfer them to outerhospitals,   A special inquiry made on the 6th November showed that the nine big London hospitals - the London, St. Bartholomews, university college, l&amp;a&amp;lesex, St. Mary&apos;s, Westminster, St. Thomas&apos;, King&apos;s college and Guys Hospital - all had vacant beds available for the ordinary needsof the population.

22.   Representations have been made to the Department of health for Scotland that tubercular patients sent home at the outbreak ofwar should be readmitted to hospital.   The Department have intimated that they will take no exception to this in cases where the CountyMedical Officer considers it desirable; they have added, however,that only in exceptional circumstances should., more than one-fourth ofthe peace-time number of beds be so occupied, and that in emergencytho patients may again have to be sent home if their condition permits.23.   Payment to voluntary hospitals for the fifth fortnighthas begun.     Up to date just over  600,000 has been paid out to voluntary hospitals.24.   So far as municipal hospitals are concerned, the ministry are still awaiting replies from the representative Associo-tion ofLocal Authorities to their proposals for the financial arrangements to be made.25.    In respect of the reservation of 4,859 beds in voluntary hospitals for the period 16th - 31st October interim paymentsamounting to  18,860 have been made.26.   Further investigation of the progress of the hut schemeshows that by tho end of November huts to accommodate 6,840 bods for patients will haVO been completed, and hut3 to accommodate an additional6,280 beds will have been covered in and made capable of use in anemergency.27.    The MirrLstry is advised that difficulty over materials is increasing.   No difficulty has yet been experienced, over labour.28.   In Scotland satisfactory progress is being made on tho nowhutted hospitals and. hutted, annexes.29.   Several of the London base hospitals are now working, manyhundredo of sick having been transferred from the town hospitals, whilefurther convoys of Service sick have been brought back from Prance.Major operations are being conducted at hospite.ls which in normal timeshave no facilities for these, and the scheme for the London Region isnow in effective operation.30.   The Minister of Health is negotiating with a representativeCormittee of the medical profession the terms on which consultantsand specialists a.t present employed in the Emergency Medical service on a whole-time basis can be transferred to a part-time basis so as toenable them to engage in private practice.Evaluation.31.   There have been no major new developments during the fortnightDebates on evacuation took place in tho House of Lords on November 1stend in tho House of Commons on November 2nd.    The President of theBoard of 3d.uca.tion announced the arrangements to be rta3e for the

re-opcning of schools in reception areas.   The arrangements for rocoveryof payments from paronts are now in operation.32a    It is &quot;believed that on tho 2nd November 50 per cent, of thomothers and ovor 78 per cent of the children then remained in the reception areas, i.o. ,   that 50 fo of tho mothers and 22$ of the children had returned,in Scotland it is estimated from tho returns received that, out of a totalof 173,000 persons originally moved officially to the reception areas,90,000, or 52% have returned to the evacuation areas.   For unaccompaniedchildren alone the percentage of returns is lower.   Out of 66,000, 26,000,or 40$^ have returned.     Generally, however, it nay be assumed that takingofficial and unofficial evacuation together evory second school-ohildbelonging to tho evacuation areas is at presont in a reception area.33.    The problem of the possible evacuation of the &quot;undor-5&apos;s&quot; without their mothers is being worked out.34.   A circular has been issued by the Minister of Health to evacuatingand receiving local authorities drawing attention to the importance of adequate provision of clothing suited to country needs during the winter.The circular -emphasises tho parental responsibility but draws attention to existing facilities in suitable cases under the Unemployment assistance board and the Public Assistance Authorities.   Reference is made to voluntaryactivities in various forms.   Arrangements have been made under which directors of Education are authorised where necessary to make provision formackintoshes and boots up to a limited quota., but no publicity is being givento the existence of these arrangements.BKxargenpy Relief in Kjnd to Refugees from Air Attack.35.   Sinoe the date of the previous report, attention has been concentrated on the vulnerable areas, to ensure that their schemes are reasonably complete in such natters a.s the final earmarking of premises bythe Office of Works, the provision of food stocks, and co-operation with thopolice.   Talcing all the Civil Defence Regions abutting on the East Coast, itmay be said that the schemes of practically all the vulnerable county boroughsfor dealing with their own inhabitants are now substantially complete.   Thoposition is not quite so advanced in dealing with refugees from populouspoints along the ooast.     There has been unexpected delay in County Durhamwhich is now being made up.   East Suffolk, Kent, and the North Riding still have a good deal of detailed work to do, but the Ministry^ Regional Officersreport that in all these areas the schemes have reached a stage at which theyWould work satisfactorily in an immediate emergency.   The same is true of therest of the country, except some remote areas in Wales and the West where theneed is unlikely to arise.36.   In Scotland   tho     Department of Health&apos;s inspectors report that adequate provision to meet any immediate emergency has been made in theprincipal cities of the most vulnerable areas and in the surrounding distriotsw

In particular tho schemes for Edinburgh and Glasgow are reported to be verycomplete and likely to function smoothly.Schools.37.    Tho ma.nner in which school children, were eVacua.ted, particularly from London, necessarily resulted in some ca.ses in appropriate schoola.ccorxaodation not being available for the eva.cuatod children.    this applies especially to pupils of Soconclary Schools and Junior TechnicalSchools.    The only remedy for this is to be found in re-billeting,and the Board have issued a Circular to Local Education Authoritieshiforming them of the proper procedure to adopt where re-billeting forthis purpose is necessary.38.    The Government1 s decision to allow the re-opening of schools inevacuation area.s has been announced in Parliament.   Re-opening is subject to the provision of rea.sona.ble adr raid protcotion and Authoritieshave been givon guidance as to the type of protection required.    Theyhave also been informed that the servioes of architects to survey thebuildings will be available free of cost to them through the agency of the regional Advisory Committees of Architects and Surveyors and consulting engineers.    In announcing the GSovernmont*s decision the Board have made it clear that it involves no change in the policy which underlies thewhole of the evacuation scheme that the proper place for school childrenis in the reception areas.Public Order.39.     Public order and morale continue to be excellent*   Thepeace propaganda, of the British Union of Fascists, the Ctomaunist party and the Peace Pledge Union makes no headway.   The recent concessionsas regards lighting and entertainments have been welcomed.Railways.40.   Departmental discussions have taken place with the object of arranging, if possible, for speciad cheap ra.il facilities to be madeavailable to bona fide visitors to children and others who come withinthe priority classes billeted in reception areas under the Governmentevacuation scheme.41*    The Minister of Transport and the President of the Board of Trademet representatives of trade and industry on 31st October and impressed upon them the need for loading and unloading wagons with the utmostdespatch^    The representa-tives promised their co-operation.42*    The relaxation of coal rationing will, it is hoped, have a beneficial effect on the wagon position, owing to more rapid clearance of stocks of coal a.t present held by merchants in wagons in railway andpriva.te sidings*

43.    The past fortnight has been quiet and no special difficulties have arisonr.   Conditions at the ports continuesatisfactory^Road Transport.44.   The position generally as regards both goods and passengo:road transport continues to be satisfactory, although the aggregatefuel consumption by goods vehicles is still in excess of the amountallocated for then0Alternative Accommodation for Government Staffs.45. The number of staffs already moved to places outside london is 16,494. The number of staff movod during the period under review is 1,649 o   Other moves are under consideration.46o   The question of the provision of air raid protection forevacuated staffs is  ;still wider consideration^47*   A contract has been let for the erection of a huttedcamp to provide 1,200 office places.   The contract period is sixmonths*J.A.Ministry of Home Security,Homo Office,Whitehall.17th November, 1939.
