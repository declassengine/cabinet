o.W.P. (R)(39) 41WAR CABINET.SUPPLY il-ID PRODUCTION.SECOND MONTHLY REPORT. SUBMITTED BY THE MINISTER OP SUPPLYCOVERING THE P. .period UP TO 30th SEPTEMBER, 1939.1 . The value of all orders placed &quot;by the Ministry from the outbreakof War to 30th September, 1939, was approximately  100 millions, towardsthe total of  130 millions stated in paragraph 2 of the First Ministry ofSupply Report i.c.  2+0 millions between 18th and 30th September and pr.60 millions up to 18th September.PART I.     MUNITIONS STORES.2. Deliveries for September are generally satisfactory for allmedium anti-aircraft equipments, shell and cartridge cases, Bren guns,anti-tank rifles and machine gun carriers.     On a considerable number ofother items there was a slight recession in deliveries, mainly due todisturbance caused by the onset of war conditions and to delays indeliveries of materials, components, &amp;o., including requirements on orderfrom abroad. The increased volume of war orders has not yet, of course,taken effect.3. As regards foreign purchases,  the position on the main itemsconcerned is as follows:-Bofors hO mm. A.A. Equipments from Sweden, Poland and Hungary.Deliveries of complete equipments have ceased from thesecountries.      (See below as regards home production of theseequipments.)mechanioal Puaes &amp; Fuze Setters from Switzerland.These were temporarily held up but are now released and nodifficulty is anticipated by the firm in completing deliveriestheir existing contracts.Heightfinders from Austria.Deliveries have ceased.Heightfinders from Prance.Arrangements are in hand which will permit of deliveries212 i being/TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may Toe takento ensure the secrecy of this document.8gCRET Copy No.  If-J

being made, though not in accordance with the original promises.Predictors from. America.Some reduction in deliveries during September, but there isno actual hold-up.4, First deliveries from home production have commenced for:-40 mm. Bofors A.A. equipments from Nuffield Mechanizationand the R.O.F., Nottingham.40 mm. predictors.5-5&quot; gun howitzer.4-5&quot; B.L.  shell.Besa guns and ammunition.5. The following schemes of major importance, in addition to those previously reported, have been approved and arc being put into operation:-A new Royal Ordnance Factory for the produotion of rifles withcapacity for an output of 10,000 a week-.Increase of predictor output by Messrs. Vickers-Armstrongs,Crayford.Increased production of searchlight carbons by the GeneralElectric Co.New joint manufacturing scheme to produce 56 tanks monthlyto be undertaken by a group of manufacturers headed by Messrs.Nuffield Mechanisation, Ltd.Considerable extensions of manufacturing capacity for 25 pdr.and for 5.5&quot; Gun-howitzer carriages by various contractors.A considerable number of firms are being brought into use forshell production as necessary plant becomes available.Royal Ordnance Factories.6. The filling factory at Charley is practically completed and work is being accelerated on the factories at Bridgend and Glascoed.Work has started on the site for the new filling factory at Swynnerton andthe site is being acquired for the factory to be erected at Warrington.The first unit of the T.N.T. factory at Irvine is in full production and the second unit will bo in production at the end of the&apos;month.     Trial runs of the nitric acid plant at the Pembrey T.N.T. factorywill commence at an early date.     Building work on the Pembre3r AmmoniaNitrate factory is approaching completion and the erection of planthas been commenced.     It is expected that production at the Cordite2. factory/

i h.factory at Bishop ton will connence in February. .   The buildingcontract for the cordite factory at Marchwicl will Toe placed this weekand contracts for the main machinery for this factory and also foriheT.N.T. factory to be erected at Drigg have been placed.      The layout ofthe R.D.X. factory at Bridgwatcr has &quot;been completed and the contracthas been placed for special acid plant.The fuze factory at Blackburn is practically complete.Deliveries from this factory have already commenced and the firstbatch of fuzes on a productive basis has passed proof.     G-ood progress isbeing made with the shell plant to be installed at Birtley and the plant has been ordered for the new shell units to be located atCardonald and Wigan.     The erection of the steelwork for the newgun factory at Leeds has commenced and good progress is being madeat the gun factory at Dalrauir.     Production work has already commencedat the latter factory.Heavy and Super Heavy Artillery.7. Although formal demands have not yet boon received,  largeextra requirements for heavy and super-heavy artillery equipmentsand ammunition have been indicated.     Steps ore being taken to hasten the reconditioning of existing heavy guns and howitzers and road and railway mountings, and to provide capacity for shell.     An order foreight 12&quot; howitzer pieces  has boon placed, and re-&quot;design of this typeand of the 9.2&quot; howitzer is in hand on an all-steel basis with renewableliners.Machine Tools.8. Detailed;/investigations of production facilities of machine toolfirms are being made with a view to removal of &quot;bottle-necks&quot; and plantis being provided to clear these.     Arrangements are also being madefor a proper run of production with selected firms.     Schemes so farsanctioned cover Capstan lathes, automatics and grinding machines, and provide for increases of 50$ in the case of Capstan lathes and 100$ inthe case of automatics and grinding machines.     Many firms, not normallyemployed on this work, have been brought into service,  either as producers of simple equipment or as sub-contractors.     Meetings have been held withthe/

13the Manufacturers&apos; Panel, and the problem of augmentation of output ofindustry as a whole is being discussed in detail and definite plansformulated.     The Importers&apos; Panel has held two meetings.   a statementof the &quot;dollar&quot; requirements of all importers of machine tools has beenprepared for the information of the Treasury.     The question of the furtherproduction in this country of foreign made machine tools is under discussionwith selected firms.     A comprehensive scheme for utilising idle machine tools, and for reconditioning machine tools for use and repair in case ofair raid damage, is under discussion with the Panel representative of thesecond-hand machine tool trade which has been constituted.Research.9, Important progress has been made with the development of centrifugalcastings for gun barrels.     The first experimental castings for 40 ram.anti-aircraft guns has passed the required tests and barrels are nowready for machining.     Messrs. Firth Brown &amp; Co. have carried out the experimental work at Sheffield and the machining of the barrels will bedone at the Royal Ordnance Factory, Nottingham.     This development offersprospect of large economies in both time and money.Area Organisation.10. Apart from the normal duties in connection with progress work onorders for the Department, offers from firms who have capacity availableare now being received through Area Officers.     These are transmitted toHeadquarters after preliminary enquiry locally and are being dealt withby the Production Branches.Canada.11. The special Mission in Canada have been instructed to proceed withorders   on the basis of the original list provided to them and have beeny/arned that further orders up to the extent of a full year&apos;s output willprobably be placed with them at an early date.     Authority has been givenfor the extension of the plant of the National Steel Car Corporation toraise their capacity up to a total of 32,000 a week for shell of the3.45&quot;  - 3.7&quot; and 4.5&quot; group.PART II. - CLOTTIIPC-, PQUIRIPNT AND STORES.12. Whilst progress had been made, prior to the outbreak of war,in the production of the requirements of the stores, etc., mentioned,4, increased/

Cl Aincreased effort has &quot;been na.de during the past month to widen the fields of production and to increase output.13, Trade Panels have been formed - and more are being formed - tofacilitate the manufacture and purchs.se of many classes of goods,e.g., leather articles, brushes, tools, badges and buttons, ankleboots, rubber boots, clothing, etc.The Progress Organisation to follow up and to obtain earlycompletion of contracts has been, strengthened and is being utilisedto a greater extent to keep in touch with contractors to securefulfilment of promises.15. In various cases, whore difficulties have been encountered in securing adequate supplies, alternative specifications have beenconsidered and good results arc expected.16. A few instances arc appended which show in some detail progress made:-Greatcoats.The normal productive cax^acity for the cloth of which thesecoats are made is small and to meet the enormous increase in requirementcloth mills have had to bo organized and instructed, and specificationshave had to be varied.     Supplies are now coming in at the rate of over200,000 yards a week, and arc increasing rapidly.      Since 1st April lastcontracts have been placed for 1,381,150 coats, 266,000 have beenreceived and in the week ended 7/10/39 the delivery rate had reached 56,000.Ankle Boots.Since   1st April last,contracts have been placed for 1,763,800and 1,014-1,668 have been received.     In the week ended 7th October 102^,000pairs were delivered.Battle Dress.Contracts have been placed since 1st April last   for 1,900,000 suits,and 600,000 have been received.     Deliveries in the week ended7th October amounted to 80,000 suits.Rubber Knee Boots.Contracts have been placed, for 341*425 since 1st April last and178,866 have been received since that date - the delivery rateapportioned to the Army is at present 15,000 a week, and consultations5 m with/

with the Trade are how taking place to increase this rate.Sheepskin Goats &amp; Leather Jerkins.Urgent requirements arc coning in for these articles, and contracts have been placed for all the jerkins asked for (6A1,090).50,000 sheepskin coats are required.     Contracts have been placed for7,200.     A difficulty exists in obtaining the specified lining for theremainder, and substitutes arc being considered by the War Office.31ankets.Since 1st January,last contracts have been placed for over,000,000 and 3,027,000 have been received.     The delivery during theweek ended 7th October amounted to 227,500.PART III RAW MATERIALS.17. The controlling bodies which wore established at theoutbreak of war are rapidly completing their organizations.     Por thosematerials in regard to the supply of which the greatest difficulty isexpected control over use and sale is being extended.     Control of thiskind inevitably gives rise to some complaints from those who have to be denied the continued use of the materials;    but it has not up to thepresent been necessary to adopt very strict rationing, except for the limited range of materials for which war demands greatly exceed peace-timesupplies and requirements.     The stages in the development of the variouscontrols up to and including the 30th September are detailed below.Iron and Steel.18. The Control extends not only to the raw material, but eJLsOto many semi-manufactured and manufactured products, and is on extensionof a system operating voluntarily before the war.19. The Iron arid Steel Orders prohibit sales and purchases(except under licence) for other than exempted purposes.     The list ofexemptions is based on the Central Priority Committee&apos;s list ofpreferential requirements and covers a wide range.     Control within thisrange is exercised by direct contact with the principal manufacturers andby the control of raw material supplies.     Centralised purchases of scrapand imported pig iron are made through the British Iron and Steel Corporation.The Control extends to ferro-alloys end refractories.     An Order relating/tc

to scrap iron prohibits the acquiring and disposal of certain kinds of scrap, except under licence, and fixes maximum prices thereof.20. A proposal is being considered to buy up the entire outputof tungsten ores from the Empire, and from the British-owned Beralt Co. in portugal amounting to about 8,000 tons per annum, on long term contract at prices slightly above pre-war, but below ruling.market prices;21. Negotiations are proceeding with the Swedish Government toincrease supplies of high grade iron ore and certain special grades of pig iron,steel and ferro-alloys.     Negotiations with Norway, Holland and Belgium arealso in prospect.     Close contact is being maintained with the -FrenchG-Overnment for co-operation in purchasing wherever possible.22. The Control is operating smoothly but heavy A.R.P. demands areresponsible for difficulty in fulfilling other orders for steel sheet.     Thereis also a very large demand for steel rods for use in reinforced concrete forthe same purpose ..Non-Ferrous Metals.23. The control and licensing systems are working reasonablysmoothly.     A new Non-Ferrous Order extends to all sales, the restriction onsales to consumers and limits the exemption from this restriction to contractsat fixed and ascertained prices.     The operation of the Control has, in effect,closed the London Metal Exchange and discussions have been proceeding on thequestion of liquidating existing contracts.     A basis of agreement has nowbeen reached.     A new Aluminium Order restricts the sale and purchase of aluminium and aluminium alloys, except under licence, and provides for a licence for use.     A further Order amended the provisions regulating themaximum prices for secondary aluminiui and for both virgin and secondaryaluminium alloys.     Adjustments wore also ma.de in the prices of the alloyedmetals on which the prices of alloys arc to be calculated.2A. On the 17th September an Order was made with the object of fixing the maximum prices of tin at a reasonable price having regard to panicbuying of Straits tin in the U.S.A.      The Government of the Straits Settlementsmade a corresponding order and it would appear that this action, coupled withthe decision of the Intern^^ onal ^in Committee to increa.se the output quota7, Ao

to 100 per cent, for the third quarter of 1939, has already resulted in asubstantial fall in the price of tin quoted in the U.S.A. market, although this price is still considerably above the basic maximum of  230 for standardtin prescribed by the Tin Order.25. The Contracts for bulk purchases, from the Empire, of copper,zinc and lead are ready for signature and one for aluminium is in activepreparation.     The desirability of instituting a formal control over magnesiumis under discussion with the Air Ministry.26. In conjunction with the Air Ministry, the question of the supplyof iridium is now being investigated but it is not expected that a formalcontrol scheme will be necessary.     There is some evidence   of a temporaryshortage of cadmium, but the position is being watched.     The position ofradium is also being watched in conjunction with the Air Ministry and theMinistry of Health.Sulphuric Acid:    Pyrites.27.    The acid makers have agreed to hold the pre-war prices, itis hoped, until the end of the year, and meanwhile a plan of agreed buying ofpyrites by us and the French is under discussion with representatives of theFrench Mission and of the French acid industry;    the attendance at these meetings of a representative of the Ministry of Economic Warfare has beenarranged.Fertilisers.28. Pre-war prices arc, for the present, being held voluntarilyby the industries.     A statutory control may soon be necessary and theControllers of Fertilisers are now considering the heads of a scheme, in thelight of discussions which the Ministry and they have had with representativesof the Ministry of Agriculture.29. An Honorary Adviser haw been appointed on potash, in theperson of Mr. Hattrick, who represented the late Potash Cartel;    his appointment has been welcomed by the Palestine potash interest.Paint Industry.30. Representations have been Lio.dc by the paint industry as tothe supply position of certain of their raw materials.     Investigation hasshown that there is probably not a great deal of substance in these complaints.In the case of one material, however, i.e. chromic oxide,  a green pigment8. /required

required for camouflage print, a shortage certainly exists.     It has been        ^ ti . be   **ascertained that there axe alternative green pigments,  said to be in plentifulsUpply, which, in fact,  some paint nmufacturers are already using, and theattention of Government contract departments has been drav/n to this.     there appears to have been an excessive use of chronic oxide, e.g0, for hedge spraying-paints used by the Air ministry, and the Ministry is in touch with that.Department on the subjects     Discussions arc proceeding with 1.0.1. and one ofthe bichromate makers on the possibility of establishing new plants.Miscellaneous Chemicals.31. There have been a great number of representations by users ofdifferent chemicals;   mostly they were concerned with supplies and not prices.It may be that a scheme of rationing introduced by LCI.    with a view to securing priority for essential needs was not well understood at the outset,but whether or no this be a true explanation, complaints arc now less numerous.In a number of cases,  of course, difficulties arose through stoppage of Germansupplies, and the Ministry&apos;s efforts have been directed to find new sources of supply.Timber.32. A licensing system to control the felling and sale of growingtrees, with maximum prices, has been substituted for the temporary limitationof sales imposed by on earlier Ordur.     A licensing system has been establised for the control of deliveries of timber from merchants&apos;  stocks and from newsupplies.     These systems are being operated through local offices set up overthe country.     Returns of stocks are not yet available but, having regard tothe heavy demands for national purposes,  there can be no doubt that on acute shortage is imminent.     Every effort is being made to secure further supplies.For this purpose and to prevent undue rise of prices, the purchase.se of alltimber from abroad has now been centralised in the Controller of timber supplies and purchases abroad by other persons have been prohibited,  except under licence.     Special steps are being taken to secure imports of pitwood,of which a serious shortage has resulted from the interruption due tonobilisa.tion in Franc.Paper 033. Proposals are under consideration for the purchase in bulkfrom abroad of paper making materials and the more systematic collection of9, /waste

ft rwaste materials is being encouraged.     Economy in the use of news-print hasalready &quot;been effected on a voluntary basis and proposals for rationing suppliesof paper generally are also being prepared.    A revision of the prices fixedunder the first Order is in contemplation.Hides, Skins and Leather.34-. A central purchase.se pool for hides from abroad has beenestablished by the trade acting in close touch with the Leather Controller,and the maximum prices for such hides have been -withdrawn.     The Controllerhas been given power to allocate native hides to the tanners, the mojcimumprices being retained.     A large part of the native hides is required for /armyboots.     Maximum prices are to be fixed for leather made from imported or nativehides.     Steps are being taken to secure that the additional profit on leatherfrom native hides accrues to the Government and not to the tanners.Wool.35. The negotiations for the bulk purchase of the wool clips ofAustralia and New Zealand have not yet been brought to a final conclusion.Proposals are under discussion with the South African Government that H.M.Government in the United Kingdom should undertake to support the South Africanwool market if necessary.Hemp.36. A further stage has been reached in the development of control,And licences are now required by persons who desire to deal in hemp ox* to use it.Centralised purchase on Government acount for manilla and true hemp is nowbeing undertaken by the Controller for all U.K. requirements.     In the case ofsisal, negotiations have been opened with the East African Governments with aview to fixing a reasonable price for supplies to this country.     The Control isin process of testing prices abroad, but the indications are that prices for all types have risen substantially.Flax.37- As in the case of hemp, licences are now required to deal in and to use flax.     Centralised purchase on Government account is being madeabroa.d for all requirements;    but purchase.ses in La.tvia, Estonia and LithuandLa0X0 not likely to be large.    A proposal, is under considera.tion for the purchase/ofThese negotiations have since been concluded, and an agreement reached at prices about 30 per cent above last year&apos;s prices.10.

of the -whole of this year&apos; a Northern Ireland flax crop, end the question of expanding production is &quot;being explored.   The price of Belgian flax, which lalikely to be the most easily available source of supply, has1 increased byabout 30 per centoJute.38. All our supplies of raw jttte .are&quot;dbtained from India.     Theprices which were established at the outbreak of war were at a very low level,and, as prices in India, and therefore world prices, have now settled down ata level not markedly different fron a normal peace-time level, the maximum prices have been withdrawn^     Control of the use of jute has been established.Negotiations have been opened with the Indian Government regarding thepossibility of purchases being made throught the Indian Supply Organisation ata fixed price.Silk.39. The plans for a silk control were framed on the hypothesis that supplies from Japan and Italy would not be available.     In view of the neutrality of these countries, it has been found i^possible to relax the controland allow ordinary dealings for the time being.     An exception has been made,however, in the case of noils and noil yarn, both of which are essential formilitary purposes.      Imports of raw silk are, for the present, being limitedto the average of the last two years, and no purchases are allowed involving the use of dollars.      The price of silk has risen from 12/- to 16/- per lb.Artificial Silk.1+0. The only control over this material was the issue of amaximun price Order on the outbreak of war, and this has not yet been varied.Bristles.2+1. Complaints were mode by brush manufacturers in regard to supplies of bristles and the various tro.de interests have now agreed to forma joint committee and so co-operate in assuring supplies at reasonable prices.Mica.l\2. Stocks of &quot;munitions&quot; grades appeojr to be low.     An Ordercalling for information as to stocks ha.s been made.       A discussion between the Service- Departaents&apos; interested and the users -has been/arranged

ft fj/ /f \) 5with a view to considering the possibility of a modification ofthe present high qualities specified for Service orders.. Cement.43&apos; Despite heavy demands, productive capacity seems tohe sufficient.     In some instances a relaxation of lighting restrictions has been secured to allow night work.     Local shortage,however, particularly at Glasgow (largely supplied from the Thames),has arisen through lack of coastal shipping.     The Board of trade have given assistance and the position is improving.     The CementMakers&apos; Federation are also endeavouring to assist by arrangingalternative sources of supply.Cotton.2+4.    The Cotton Board has been set up under the chairmanship of Sir Percy Ashley to exercise what is for the moment a voluntarycontrol over the cotton trade,     A series of committees will beset up and, in drawing up a scheme, the Board are working in close consultation with the Ministry of Supply and the Board of Trade.Rubber.2+5&apos;    Sir WalrOnd Sinclair has made arrangements for the setting-up of a series of committees representing both the rawmaterials interests and the various manufacturing sections witha view to settling voluntarily any difficulties which may arise.-At the request of the Home Office a discussion with the rubbertrade and other interests was held with a view to shifting stocksof rubber in the London Docks in order to reduce the fire risk.The possibility of manufacturers holding larger stocks and a widerdispersal in the docks is being considered,E.L.B.The Adelphi, W.C.2.15th October, 1939.
