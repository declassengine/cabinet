for an agreement regulating trade in conditions of war.      Thesuccessful outcome of such negotations must depend, however,on the realisation by the Spanish Government, before formaldiscussions took place,  of the solid advantages to them of coming to some arrangement with His Majesty&apos;s Government, whomust show no anxiety to conclude an arrangement,16.
