A. HOME.(1) Posters and Pamphlets.The Anti-G-ossip Posters are being displayed on27,000 telephone booths and arrangements are also in hand for their exhibition in railway carriages, etc.    A seriesof posters to denote Britain&quot;s war effort, the Empire&apos;sstrength and Britain&apos;s industrial strength are in preparation for display on 25,000 sites which have beenmade available to the Ministry by the Railway Companies.,The pamphlets &quot;Can Germany stand the Strain&quot; and &quot;How Hitlermade the War&quot; are now ready for distribution, and &quot;The StruggleAhead&quot; will shortly be availableo(2) Films.The film &quot;The First Days&quot; produced by the po0o FilmUnit, showing London&apos;s transition from peace to war footinghas been shown in London^    A film is being prepared by thesame Unit on the balloon barrageo    Proposals are in hand forthe commissioning from the Trade of several documentary films.(3) General.In addition to the publicity measures mentioned inmy last report, I have been asked to undertake a publicity campaign on the subject of evacuation with special referenceto the need to discourage a drift homewards at Christmas time.I have also in mind the need of organising an anti-defeatism campaign.As an initial step in this direction, I think it ofgreat importance that the holding of public meetings, lecturesand other forms of social gathering should be resumed.    In thefirst place I want to dispel the prevailing impression thatsuch meetings are at present discouraged by H.M.G. and I amdiscussing with the Home Secretary the steps to be taken tothis end.    At the moment I do not consider it is desirablethat ray Ministry should undertake the organisation of such

meetings, but I propose to do what I can to encourage existinglocal bodies to resume their activities in this direction.B.        OVERSEAS,Pull use has been mode of the improvement in communica-tions to send photographs, feature articles and publicitymatter of all kinds to our representatives abroad.     With the help of the P.O., the Italian Government has been induced toprovide telephonic communication from Prance eastwards to the balkans without passing through enemy territory,,      I have obtained Treasury sanction for a 32 page pictorial publicationcomposed of photographs showing britain&apos;s war strength. 750,000copies of this publication will be distributed, for sale at a nominal price in neutral countries and the Empire.I have had the advantage of a personal conversation withHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome in regard to publicity policyin Italy.      The Ambassador considers that whilst so far as political propaganda is concerned we should confine ourselves to an objective presentation of the British case there are anumber of methods by which Anglo-Italian relations might be improved.      These include the supply of material to ItalianAuthors for articles in the Italian Press;    the, writing up inthe British Press of such solid achievements of the Italiansas their Youth Movement,  social services, land policy and the19h2 Exhibition;    the supply of British News Reels to Italy;and improved broadcast transmission bearing an official Britishstamp.For the Empire steps are being taken to provide speciallyrecorded broadcast material such as speeches delivered by prom-inent public figures.      The -B.B.O. are including special newscommentaries and feature talks adapted to colonial audiences;and mobile cinema units are being constructed for use in Africa.

(Ji) Oi5i 0EFFECT.The item of propaganda which aroused most comment isthe White Paper on the atrocities in German ConcentrationCamps,      It has teen widely reported in all quarters of theworld but the local reactions, especially in the UnitedStates, have not been universally favourable.      In France,Britain&apos;s war effort receives the usual tributes.      In italy the Soviet manifesto has aroused considerable indignationand it is to be hoped that the Italian Press may as a resulttend to become more favourable towards this Country.Lord Halifax&apos;s broadcast and Mr. Churchill&apos;a; statementhave been widely reportedp and it is generally accepted thatthe Allies will stand by their previous declarations in response to the offer of mediation from Queen Wilhelmina and king Leopold,,Gorman news continues to predominate in Belgrade and bulgaria, but in Greece and Croatia the British case hasbeen well presented?      In Turkey and the Near East opinion is firmly pro-Ally0    Favourable comment on British films hasbeen received from Denmark and Egypt;    and in Japan, wherea Bureau of Information has been set up, the German Ambussa-dor is reported to have expressed the fear that british propaganda was beginning to influence Japanese opinion.    Ingeneral there has been less; comment on pacifist tendenciesin this country, but prominence Is still given to tine british press&apos;s criticism of the Government&apos;s domestic policty,especially in the matter of controls,,
