The Padio campaign for nearly two months now Dr. Goebbels&apos; machine hasbeen running at full -power.    What that means may be judged from its cost, estimated at from  6,000,000 to  20,000,000 perannum before the v/ar, and from the formidable torrent of talkbroadcast daily in some ten languages.    The characteristics ofthat talk are sufficiently well known;    it is a medley ofboasting, abuse, threats, and history redrawn by broad touchesof fiction into the likeness of things that might have been but were not.All this has gone out with very little discriminationto Germans, enemies and neutrals alike, which is as if wetrusted our letters for delivery to a postman who could notread.    The result is sometimes, as is to be expected, merefutility, as for example in the delivery in English of a talkobviously intended for the benefit of the French.    This blunder,to which attention was called in the first of these surveys,has been repeated during the last week of October.It is not, of course, suggested that all German-propaganda has been as inept as that.    Blunders there havebeen, and some confusion in the re-writing of history - theAthenia has now been sunk in so many different ways that ithas evidently proved too difficult to remember whether she wasoutward or homeward bound.But it would be rash to assume that the seed sownhas all been wasted.    What results have been achieved?results in attempting to estimate what value the germans have obtained in this way for their money, it will suffice ifwe consider three countries where German propaganda has seemedto native observers much more effective than our own.    Thosethree countries are Sweden, Belgium and Holland.    Censoredmail has been full of regrets and complaints, obviously fromwriters well disposed to us, that we have done so little and.the Germans so much.    When, however, we come to ask whatprecisely the effects of this allegedly so effective propagandahave been, apart from the regrets of our friends, we find that,except in one direction, they are not easy to trace.    That onedirection is Commerce;    there can be no doubt that the offer by the Germans of commodities which we either cannot or willnot sell has compelled the Swedes into dealings with Germany.There are, however, some signs that the Germans are now beginning to draw back when it comes to the point of clinchinga bargain.    In Belgium too, German commerce, helped no doubtby the large staff of journalists reported to be attached tothe German Legation, is having its success, and the export licence system in force, combined with the poor pay of Belgiancustoms officials, has given rise to a brisk smuggling tradeacross the German frontier.    In Holland, as in Belgium and sweden, there were repeated complaints from our friends that german newspapers arrived in. ample quantities, whilst ourswere late or even unobtainable.    The writers of these complaintsseemed to be genuinely grieved at what appeared to them to bethe feebleness, comparatively, of our propaganda.    There has,however, been substantial improvement effected, and Britishnewspapers now reach Holland and Belgium on the day of issue.

There are two points worth noting in all this.    Inthe first place,  in Sweden and Holland there are no broadcastsfrom Germany in the vernacular,  though no doubt in both countries there are many listeners who understand German;Belgium has no German broadcasts addressed particularly toher, but perhaps most listeners, even in Belgian Flanders,would understand the German talks in Frencho    Whatever successhas been obtained by German propaganda would seem, then, to bedue to methods other than broadcastingsWhat,  in the second place, has the success been?That neutrals are willing to trade with Germany when it is good business to do so is neither surprising nor novel - thefact that Greece has needed no propaganda to induce her to do this was noted in an earlier survey.    There is no evidencethat people!s sympathies have been won for Germany by theunending stream of talk from German radio stations; on thewhole, and apart from papers controlled or subsidized byGermany, we have a good press in all three countries.    in belgium, so small is germany&apos;s confidence in her own propagandathat she has actually begun to threaten the Belgians withpunishment for alleged exhibitions of sympathy with the Allies.Turning now to two peoples who have been among theregular customers,  or targets, of German broadcasts since thebeginning of the war (and earlier, for that matter), the spaniards and the Arabs, we find the former firm in theirresolve to remain neutral, the latter, in spite of recenthistory in Palestine, overwhelmingly on our sidesThe destination of some of the German broadcasts in english has been the th SoAo    Their anti-British propaganda inthat country has lacked neither vigour nor venom.    Yet therehas been only one thing, so far, that the Germans can havehoped for from the UoSoA. since the war began, and that is a refusal to repeal the so-called &quot;arms embargo&quot;o    At the moment of writing it does not look as if they are going to have thatone thingsAnother nation from which Germany has wanted andwants much is Russia.    How much she will get remains to be seenbut whatever it is it will not have been won by broadcastpropaganda, for Germany, voluble, as has been noted above,  inten or more languages, is most significantly silent in Russia.Can that mean that there is nothing which it would suit boththe Russians to hear and the Germans to say?    If so, that isone more piece of evidence of how uneasy the partnership is -indeed in other partnerships the situation would suggestpossibilities of divorce.In some of the countries of Central and South Americain Mexico, for example, and in Bolivia, there is evidence of strong pro-German sympathieso    This is due in part to political conditions, in part to well-organised German activities incommerce and in education - due, in short, to a situation which german propaganda of one kind and another helped to createbefore the war;    there is no evidence that Dro Goebbels&apos; fairytales during the war have still further improved the situationin Germany&apos;s favour.There is one country which is fortunate above all others in its receipt of Dro Goebbels&apos; radio attentions, andthat country of course is Germany.    What the reactions of theGerman people are it is impossible to say;    no doubt they vary from individual to individual, and in different parts of thecountry.    But we do know that the doctor had become a joke, and

a rather bad joke, for many Germans before the war,  that theywere hungry for reliable news, and that some at least of themsought such news, well after the beginning of the war, fromBritish and French broadcasts-    It is perhaps a fairly safesurmise that whilst Nazi propaganda-broadcasts help to keepthe minds of thoroughly indoctrinated young Nazis &quot;sweet&quot; forthe regime, their effect on more critical minds is small.conclusions to sum up, on the evidence available we have theright to doubt whether German broadcasts during the war havewon any new friends for Germany or made any enemies for us.It is not unlikely that the war may finish a process which hadcertainly begun before it,  the process of so disgusting men5sminds with propaganda, and so sharpening their wits for itsdetection,  that it will become a waste of time for governments to give their people anything but &quot;straight&quot; news, he. factas far as possible uncontaminated by subjective flavouring,and long-term publicity, which should differ from &quot;straight&quot;news in its time-range,  its &quot;temperature&quot;, and its avoidance of the worst vices of unscrupulous propaganda..    Propaganda,  ofcourse,  it is, but it need not therefore incur condemnation -it is advocacy,  but it should not be the advocacy of SergeantBuzfuz or even that of Ciceroo
