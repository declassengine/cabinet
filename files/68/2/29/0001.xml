REPORT ON THE FOOD SUPPLY POSITION.Stocks of Foodstuffs.The stock position cf the main foodstuffs, at the latest date forwhich returns are available, is shown in the Appendix.     September figures arealso shown for purposes of comparison;   these are the figures which were givenin the Ministry1 s First Report, corrected in certain cases in the light of later information.It will he seen that stocks have fallen over the whole range of foodstuffs during the period under review.     In general this is due to the initial difficulties of importation, particularly shipping and purchases whichare dealt with in more detail in the following two sections of this Report.The deterioration is more serious in cereals and animal feeding-stuffsthan in other commodities.     The stocks of flour, including wheat in terms of flour at 70 per cento extraction and allowing for the &quot;balance of the home cropapart from seed requirements, have fallen during the 5 weeks September 16th to october 21st from the equivalent of 27 weeks&apos; normal human consumption to the equivalent of 20 weeks.     Stocks of barley and maize were low at the outbreakof war, equivalent to 3 weeks&apos; consumption apart from the balance of the homecrop of barley;    the quantities afloat were small.     The stock of maize is nowpractically exhausted.     There are 25 weeks&apos; supply of barley, representedalmost entirely by the home crop.     In the normal course the bulk of this wouldbe absorbed in brewing.The main factor in this deterioration of the cereals position is thelow arrivals:   during the 7 weeks ended 21st October they totalled 700,000 tons compared with import requirements of nearly 1-g- million tons.     The rate ofdeterioration is being reduced hut it is estimated that on the basis of theships chartered for cereals, the deficiency in the arrivals of cereals up tothe end of December will exceed one million tons.The fall in wheat stocks has been accelerated by the increased feedingof wheat to livestock as a result of the shortage of imported feed.     It has notyet been possible to impose any restrictions on this use of wheat.     As there isno prospect in the near future of obtaining sufficient imports of maize, andother cereal feeding-stuffs, to meet our full requirements, the policy as tolivestock production, including cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry, and livestock products including milk may need early examination.The following are comments on other foodstuffs:-Sugar stocks have fallen from 20.3 weeks&apos; to 18.8 weeks&apos; consumption.It should he borne in mind that more than half of the present stock is represented &quot;by the home crop;   next year&apos;s home crop will not begin to beavailable until October 1940.As regards meat, a diminution of arrivals has made it impossible to begin the intended expansion of the reserve of frozen meat.     There has beenevidence of abnormal slaughtering of home livestock, especially cows, for themarket.Relatively little change has taken place in the fats position. Theoutput of margarine has been increased to fill the gap in butter supplies. Astock of margarine is gradually being &quot;built up in the hands of distributors.Tea stocks declined from 22 weeks&apos; supply to 19.3 weeks&apos; supply, owingmainly to the diversion of shipping round the Cape and other shipping delays.There was also an increase of domestic purchases.     This position should be improved in the next few months.^- Shipping.Arrivals of foodstuffs in this country were much reduced during theearly weeks of the war &quot;by the dis-organisation of shipping services, due torequisitions, diversion, the preparation of the convoy system and such causes.

In September the arrivals were no more than 50 per cent, of the normal.     Theyare now more regular, though not sufficient to overtake arrears, and the main problem has &quot;become one of the amount of shipping available.A deficiency of shipping has already arisen on the Australia andSouth Africa lines, particularly for lifting the wheat and sugar purchased for october-December shipment.     On a general view, apart from refrigerated tonnage,there is now in sight a serious shortage of shipping to meet the Ministry&apos;programme of imports.     On the latest figures, the programme requiresapproximately 22 million tons of shipping space during the first year of war.According to the Ministry of Shipping&apos;s estimates, the shipping space availablefor food imports is ITg- million tons, leaving a deficiency of 4g- million tons.This deficiency of 4g- million tons is arrived at on the assumption that all available neutral tonnage is secured. JIt may he possible to make some alterations in the programme ofimports, substituting purchases from the nearer countries and so reducing thelength of passage.     Certain limitations to such a policy are dictated by theforeign exchange position and the relative level of prices, as well as by the availability of supplies.     Some modifications have already been made on theselines in the immediate programme of shipments, particularly to increase shipments from Canada.3. Import Programmes;    the position in regard to particular commodities.Cereals.It has not been possible as yet to make any large bulk purchases ofcereals.      The position is shown below.     /Tt may be assumed broadly that 500,000tons of wheat represents one month&apos;s consumption of flour in this country, and500,000 tons of feeding-stuffs, one month&apos;s consumption of feeding-stuffs7/The import programme assumes aggregate purchases of -g- million tons of^heat from Canada over the period October-December.      It may be desirable tomake an upward revision in this allocation, in order to conserve shipping byemployment of shorter routes and to meet representations of the canadian government that the Ministry&apos;s purchases in Canada should be increased.    In fact,however, the price of wheat, and also maize, is at present substantially higher in Canada than in other countries, and the Ministry have sought to purchase asmuch as possible without raising the price against themselves.     The purchasesup to the present are well below the scale represented by the import programme.During the last fortnight of October,  they amounted to 158,000 tons of wheat.An endeavour was made to persuade the Canadian Government to offer 1-g- million tons of wheat at about 70 cents, a bushel, but they stated that they have no power over sales and that purchases must hencef forward he made in the open market.The import programme assumes aggregate purchases of 1 million tons ofwheat a year from Australia.     It is likely that the shortage of tonnage willmake this impossible of realisation.     Australian wheat will not be availabletill January.     For this reason, and having regard to the shipping situation,purchases are not at present being made.Purchases of 692,000 tons of wheat, and 214,000 tons of maize havebeen made in the Argentine since the outbreak of war.      This is regarded as themaximum which can be shipped before the end of the year assuming that someneutral tonnage can be used.     Further purchases can be made without difficultyif tonnage becomes available.Wheat and maize are available at reasonable prices in the United States.Treasury authority is being sought to make purchases.Meat.(it may be assumed broadly that 100,000 tons represents five weeks&apos;normal requirements of imported meat.)Negotiations for the purchase of 246,000 tons of meat from Australia,and 300,000 tons from New Zealand, in the current season ending 30th September, 1940,

are nearly completed.     Similar negotiations with Rhodesia, though for a relatively small amount, are in progress, but the price factor is as yet unsettled.Negotiations for the purchase in the Argentine of 149,000 tons, as wellas 51,000 tons on French account, in the period ending 30th January, 1940, are completed.     Negotiations with Uruguay involving 20,000 tons of meat over aperiod of 16 weeks from the 23rd October, 1939, are in an advanced stage.Bacon and Ham.(it may be assumed broadly that 10,000 tons of bacon represents a-,7eek1 s normal supply for the country. )Negotiations have been completed for the shipment of 3,500 tons a week from Denmark, the price being about 5 per cent, higher than that ruling beforethe war.     It is, however, doubtful whether Denmark will be able to maintainshipments at this rate.Negotiations are in hand for the purchase of 2,000 tons a week from canada, over a period of a year, but a divergence of opinion still persists inregard to the price.Future supplies from Sweden, hithuania and Holland are underdiscussion v/ith those countries.Negotiations with Eire for long-term contracts are still held up onthe question of price.A few experimental purchases have been made from Balkan countries.The general position of the supply of bacon is unsatisfactory.    supplies from Denmark are uncertain.     Supplies from Sweden and Holland show a heavydecline, as also from the U.S.A.      Supplies from Northern Ireland and Eire havebeen regular, but are likely to decline owing in particular to lower productioncaused by difficulties in obtaining feeding-stuffs.     In the home market theprice of pigs has been raised to encourage producers to keep on their pigs tobacon weights, but the Order is capable of evasion and the unlimited demands ofthe pork trade have diverted a large number of pigs from bacon, v/ith the resultthat the production of home bacon has declined in recent weeks.     The Ministryhas built up a small reserve of about one week&apos;s supply in cold store, but thisreserve is not yet sufficient as a safeguard against fluctuations in supplies.Butter and Cheese.Negotiations have been practically completed v/ith Australia and NewZealand for the purchase of butter and cheese to be produced during the current year ending July, 1940*.     The total anticipated purchases are in the region of200,000 tons of butter and 100,000 tons of cheese.Errs.Negotiations v/ith Australia and South Africa for the purchase of eggsduring the period to the end of 1939 are practically complete.      It is anticipatedthat about 100 million eggs will be obtained from Australia and 35 millions from South Africa.      The prices to be paid will, it is expected, approximate tothose ruling in 1938,Sugar.Arrangements have been made with Empire Sugar Producers for the purchaseQf their exportable surplus for the current season.     The amount exceeds 1,000,000tons.     The price owing to the helpful co-operation of the producers is on thebasis of 7/6d, per cwt. which is equivalent to the price prevailing in theimmediate pre-war period.      The position, however, is seriously affected by theshortage of ships which may make it impossible to transport the whole of theQueensland crop, and it may be necessary to reple.ee some of this purchase byPurchases in Cuba at much higher prices.

Tea.Arrangements have been made to purchase supplies of Empire tea untilthe end of the present year at prices to be determined by valuation by teabrokers.     It is hoped that the quantity arriving during the three monthsNovember-February will total about 190 million lbs.     This is equivalent to nearly five months&apos; supply;     at this time of the year, however, arrivals areheaviest for seasonal causes.    It is contemplated that arrangements for subsequentpurchases will be made on the basis of a yearly contract at the prices realisedduring the three years preceding the outbreak of war.4. Inland Transport.It was inevitable that the diversion of shipping should lead to somedisorganisation and delay in the system of distribution of foodstuffs internally.The most economic use of transport in the new conditions is being examined, witha view to facilita.ting clearance from the ports and transport of goods direct tomain consuming areas, and to employing the most suitable means of transport for individual commodities.      It is probable that transfers of traffic from road torail have been done on too wide a scale.     At the present time, though the pressure on the railways is very heavy, coastwise shipping is under-employed,particularly as a result of the increase of coastwise rates due to war risks.The Pood Transport Organisation was required to adjust itself, generallyby rationalisation of distributive services, to the rationing of petrol and theloss of vehicles on reauisition.       The results are, so far satisfactory.5. prices the Ministry of Labour&apos;s Cost of Living Index for September showed anincrease during that month, the first month of war, of 9 per cent, in the retail prices of food.Actually the increases of the price of sugar and butter accounted forone half of the 9 per cent. rise.     Sugar showed, the largest rise, from 3d. to%d. per lb. of granulated sugar;    Id. of this rise -was due to the new dutyimposed in the recent Budget.      The main general factors in the rise were the initial higher costs of freight and insurance on oversea supplies and the higherinternal costs of delivery consequent upon shipping diversion.      In certain cases, e.g. eggs, there were normal seasonal causes.During much of September the Ministry&apos;s first provisional Orders werem operation, holding prices over a wide range of commodities as near as possibleto the pre-war levels.      They have been gradually replaced by Orders prescribingdefinite figures, and these inevitably begin to reflect further the higher costs of war conditions and.the rise in prices in world commodity markets.It is impossible to foretell the future course of prices.     TheFollowing paragraphs are intended to give some indication of the extent of the upward movements of world prices and costs, and in certain cases of probablemovements of retail prices in this country.British whalers will be operated on Government account during thevdialing season which will shortly begin.     Some of them have already left forthe whaling stations.     Negotiations are still proceeding   with Japanese whalinginterests for the purchase of their catch next spring.     Negotiations have notyet begun with Norwegian interests.Oilseeds.Satisfactory arrangements have &quot;been made for the purchase of theprincipal oilseeds and vegetable oils from West Africa, India and Egypt.     Goodsupplies of linseed are available in the country.Total purchases up to October amounted to 25 7,372 tons of oilseeds etc.and 29,311 tons of oils.     The greater part has naturally not yet arrived, buta fair proportion is afloat and on the way.

It is estimated that the above figures for Canadian wheat, if appliedto all wheat supplies, would cause a rise of about 0.7d. in the 4 lb. loaf of bread;    on a similar basis the Argentine figure would reflect about 0.9d. onthe 4 lb. loaf.     The average cost of flour and bread is necessarily related tothe cost of obtaining wheat from all sources.     A rise in the price paid for home-grown wheat lowers the quota payment levied on flour and therefore offsetsthe increase in the cost of bread to a small extent.An Order will be made shortly, raising the price of flour by 6/-    asack.     This will bring an increase of ^d, in the price of the 4 lb. loaf.     Thebakers are claiming a further rise on the ground of increased costs, but while some revision of their scale is probable, it is unlikely to justify a furtherrise in the price of bread.     The rise in freights may however soon necessitate :a further rise in flour.     The shortage of shipping has compelled the ministry to urge that neutral tonnage should be employed for carriage from the Plate:    atpresent rates this seems likely to involve an increase of about 5/-   per quarter in freight charges, which is itself equivalent to about -g-d. per 4 lb.  loaf.Each rise of -g-d. in the 4 lb. loaf is itself equivalent to a rise of1.3 points in the Ministry of Labour retail food index numbers.Sugar.It has been stated in Section 3 that the Ministry has purchased Empiresugar on the basis of a price of 7/6d. per cwt.      In addition there are increased freight charges.     The increase in freight from Queensland up to october 23rd amounted to about 17/9d. per ton or about 11 per cent, of theoriginal c.i.f. price.Meat.The retail prices of meat showed only slight increases during September,Freight and insurance charges have subsequently, however, increased the cost of importation,  these additions representing on a shipment of Argentine meat about .6d. per lb.     It is probable that owing to this factor and higher distributioncosts a rise in retail prices of imported meat of the order of Id. per lb. may shortly take place.As regards home-produced meat, the Ministry made on the 29th Septemberan Order prescribing definite prices over a wide range of feeding-stuffs at approximately pre-war levels, notwithstanding the higher cost of imports, theobject being to maintain for the time being the pre-war prices of meat,     It willbe necessary in the near future to introduce a new schedule of feeding^stuffsprices, reflecting more nearly the world prices.     Moreover farmers&apos; costs axeinvariably higher in the winter months owing to the larger quantities of imported feeding-stuffs required.     It is likely that from these causes the prices of livestock will shortly need revision and that this may cause an increase of theprice of home-produced meat.It has already been announced that the price of sheep will be increasedId, per lb. on average over the year.     This is also likely to be reflected in retail prices.nereals and Bread.Sinoe the outbreak of war the following increases have occurred inf,o,b, prices and infreights:-(per 480 lbs.)f.o.b. price FreightIP/heat, Canadian 4/lOd. l/9d.Plate 6/- 2/8d.Maize, Plate 5/- 2/8d.War risk Insurance is not included in these figures.

6.Food Control.The Ministry&apos;s control of foodstuffs is designed primarily to secure these two objects -(i) the concentration of oversea purchasing in the hands ofthe Government, in order to get the maximum assurance of supplies and economy in obtaining them;(ii)    the limitation of prices charged to the consumer, the effectiveness of which depends essentially on a control of supplies.The degree of control which is now &quot;being exercised varies from onecommodity to another.     For the two commodities, &quot;bacon and butter, which are tobe rationed in order to ensure equitable distribution down to the consumer,control of supplies through all stages is necessary and the organisation isbeing adapted for this purpose.In making oversea purchases the Ministry necessarily pays variedprices for stocks, in accordance with the different sources of supply.     Vihenstocks are re-distributed to traders the Ministry fixes a middle price betweenthe highest and the lowest, adding a small percentage to cover overhead charges of administration.     In some cases the Ministry pays varied prices for differentqualities.     This has happened notably in dried fruits.     In that case the grades were pooled at the outbreak of war, particularly because stocks andincoming supplies were abnormally low.     As new season&apos;s fruits are now arriving in good quantity,  this &quot;pooling&quot; will be terminated.     The following paragraphsshow the system of control in the main commodities.Cereals, Cereal Products and Feeding-Stuffs.The Ministry is the sole purchaser from overseas of all cereals andcereal products and the principa.1 kinds of animal feeding-stuffs such as oil-cake.     The flour mills are working under the Ministry&apos;s control and are sellingflour to bakers and retailers at a single delivered price.     The systemestablished by the Food Council for controlling bread prices is being continued for the time being.     Maximum prices of most animal feeding-stuffs have been fixed by Order and arrangements made for allocating supplies to distributors ona quota basis.Meat.The Ministry is the sole purchaser of imported meat, which is madeavailable for distribution to the wholesale trade.     In London the Ministry is responsible for wholesale distribution through an ad hoc wholesale trade association, operating in the place of the Central Meat Markets (Smithfield)which have been decentralised to a number of depots.     As regards home-producedsupplies, the Ministry have prescribed that fat stock may only be sold in alivestock market.     Maximum wholesale prices have been fixed for meat, and prices for fat stock including pigs.The system for the control of livestock and meat is being re-examined,following the decision not to introduce rationing for the present.Edible Oils and Fats.In order to increase supplies of margarine and in view of the irregulararrivals of oilseeds,  the Ministry took full control of the trade,  includingthe margarine industry.     A standard quality of margarine was introduced.   While&quot;the Ministry will continue to purchase raw materials in bulk, they are now considering the possibility of permitting a return to the normal practice ofproprietary brands of margarine so far as this is possible with the rawn&amp;terials available.     The Ministry must, however, ensure that sufficient quantities of the available raw materials are used in low-priced brands ofgood food value to meet the needs of the less well-to-do classes.

The Ministry makes direct contracts with the producing estates inIndia, Ceylon and East Africa.     Stocks are allotted to the trade on the &quot;basisof the quantities handled by then in a pre-war period, and at a price determinedby valuing the tea with reference to auction prices ruling prior to the outbreakof war.     By way of illustrating the need for control, prices have risen by50 per cent, in the Colombo tea market where the normal system of sale byauction has continued.

hi  SB.REPORT     ON     FOOD     PRODUCTION.(By the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in conjunctionwith the Secretary of State for Scotland.)31st October,  1939.General,The general agricultural situation has deteriorated and is now amatter for grave concern.     The administrative machinery set up for the foodproduction campaign is now in full operation and on the whole is functioningsmoothly.     There has, however, been a serious setback in the actual progressof the ploughing campaign.      In the first month of the war there was every sign of a great effort on the part of farmers, but in recent weeks there has beenunmistakable evidence, both from the County Committees, and from the officersof the Agricultural Departments who are in touch with farmers, that there is a growing feeling of uncertainty and lack of confidence which the generalassurances so far given in regard to the Governments intentions have completelyfailed to dispel.     On the one hand costs are rising - wage rates, feeding-stuffs, fertilisers, petrol and other farmer&apos;s requisites have all shownincreases - and, on the other, assurances with regard to the future areinterpreted in the light of present policy, which has been, in the main, to stabilise prices of the principal agricultural products at pre-war levels.    Theresult is hesitation on the part of farmers in undertaking the new commitmentsinvolved in an extension of their production programme for 1940 (especially inregard to cereals and potatoes) and a marked reluctance on the part of county committees to bring pressure to bear on them.     Means of overcoming these difficulties are receiving urgent consideration.County War Agricultural Executive Committees.During the toro months that the County Committees have been functioning,steps have been taken to complete their organisation.     Sub-Committees have been set up to deal with cultivations, labour, supplies, etc.    Shares of the Countyploughing-up quotas have been allotted to district Committees, and, on thebasis of a survey in each district, orders for the cultivation of definiteareas on individual farms are being issued.Ploughing-up Campaign.No figures for the acreage of grassland which has actually beenploughed up are available, but reports from the County War Executive Committeesindicate that in many districts considerable difficulties are now beingencountered in securing the ploughing up of the requisite total.     Lack of cashand credit,  inexperience in arable cultivation and uncertainties as to pricesof arable crops are stated to be among the chief reasons.     With a view toalleviating the difficulties arising from shortage of cash and credit,  thepayment of existing subsidies (including cereal subsidies and ploughing-up grant)is being expedited.     Provision is also being made for County Committees toenter into arrangements with contractors for the ploughing up of land,  thecharges being guaranteed by ear-marking the appropriate amount from the  2 per acre grant to which the farmers will be entitled when the work is completed.The period for the  2 per acre ploughing-up grant has been extendedto March 31st, 1940, and greater latitude has been given to County Committees asto the crops which they may allow to be sown on ner/ly xoloughed land, grass andbare fallow being included in exceptional cases.

Crops of 1939.Latest estimates confirm that United Kingdom crop yields vri.ll &quot;be approximately normal for all important crops except sugar beet and apples,which are above normal.Sugar production is expected to reach 465,000 tons, equal to24-25 per cent, of normal consumption.     Wheat production vn.ll be below thatof 1938.     The wheat acreage fell in 1939 by over 160,000 acres, and yieldswere not as high as in 1938.     At 1,608,000 tons it should equal 24 per cent,of normal consumption (including stock feed and seed).Tractors and Implements.Of the 3,000 tractors already ordered by the Government from FordMotor Company,  1,517 have been delivered, chiefly to the County Committees.Five hundred and fifty have been released to the Ford Company for sale to farmers.     Orders for implements have been placed with home and overseasmanufacturers for delivery this year of over ,2300,000 of various types, and apart of these orders has already been delivered.Notwithstanding the above measures, there is no doubt that this autumn there is a widespread shortage of implements (especially ploughs)required for use with tractors.Man Power.Some 10,000 agricultural workers will be called up in November andsome 5,000 more in January.     A few hundred key men are being released by theWar Office (in almost all cases only temporarily) from among those alreadyserving.Thirty thousand women have volunteered for the Y/omen&apos;s Land Army;3,750 have been trained and over 1,000 have been placed with farmers.   Asfarmers&apos; demand has been less than expected, further recruitment is being restricted.The above figures relate to England and Wales.     In Scotland 1,150women have enrolled in the W.L.A. and 50 have been placed.Reports of labour shortage are still being received from most partsof the country and it seems that farmers are unwilling to take members of theW.L.A. as substitutes for skilled workers, especially at the wage fixed by departments.      In the near future there will be a seasonal decline in require-ments, but   also the loss of some 15,000 workers called up.      In the springrequirements will again increase.Grassland.The question of improving the feeding and stock carrying capacity ofour grassland by ploughing and re-seeding and other measures is being activelyexplored.Livestock.Consideration has been given during the last few weeks to the prices to be paid by the Ministry of Food for fat cattle, sheep and pigs when theGovernment becomes the sole purchaser of livestock for food.     The proposals have been framed after hearing the views of the producers, and they are likely to be acceptable in England and Wales.     The Scottish Farmers1 Union, however,considers that better prices are required   for top quality cattle in particularand also for ewe mutton.It is in any case strongly felt by the producers - a view with whichWe concur - that the system of purchase by the Government should be institutedat the earliest possible moment.     The present situation under which a

temporary and partial control is exercised over the marketing of livestock,by means of Maximum Prices Orders, has led to grave anomalies, inequalitiesand abuses in the markets, and is profoundly unsatisfactory.     It was never contemplated that this temporary phase would last more than a fewweeks:    the whole basis of war-time livestock policy is the guaranteedmarket at guaranteed prices which has been promised.     The situation istherefore being examined as a matter of great urgency, in consultationwith the Minister of Pood, in the light of the Government&apos; s decision notto introduce for the present the rationing of meat to the consumer.Feeding-Stuffs.There is a serious shortage of imported cereals (maize and barley)which has affected pig and poultry producers;    but bovine stock has been little affected owing to good, growth of grass up to a week ago.The effect of reduced imports has been accentuated (a) by diversion of cargoes to west coast ports;    (b) transport costs;    (c) difficulties of modifying animal rations at short notice;    and (d) ineffectiveness insome respects of the Feeding-Stuffs (Maximum Prices) Order.     Some reliefhas been given farmers by permitting more use of home-grown wheat for stockfeeding.Animal Health.There have been 13 outbreaks of foot and mouth diseaseBritain during October;   this does not give ground for anxiety,the other hand, there is at present a rather serious outbreak offever which is unfortunately affecting the breeding stock.Northern Ireland.The food production campaign in Northern Ireland is on similar lines to that of Great Britain.     The Northern Ireland Ministry ofAgriculture report that ploughing up has made a satisfactory start, but theshortage of tractors and implements is considered serious.m GreatBut, onswine3o
