(R.) (39) 20)MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI. The period under review covers the first two months of war during whichthe Expeditionary Force has been despatched to France without mishap. Thehome war organization also has come into being.I. British Expeditionary ForceFormations and Personnel.2. The 2nd Corps and two Infantry Brigades mentioned in the previous report (W.P. (R) (39) 20) are now in France. The following additional units have also been sent out:  Three Anti-Aircraft Regiments.One Armoured Car Regiment.Two R.H.A. Regiments.Two R.E. Battalions.  (These are engaged in intensive digging in the B.E.F.sector using mechanical excavators.)One Heavy Regiment, R.A.Two Machine-Gun Battalions.3. Since its arrival overseas the British Expeditionary Force has been reinforced with additional fighting and service units totalling some 10,000 men.Certain of the later units of the 2nd Corps had to proceed short of some technicalequipment and vehicles. This shortage persists owing to the despatch ofreinforcing units in advance of dates originally planned.4. The total strength of the British Expeditionary Force, exclusive of R.A.F.personnel, is now about 172,000.5. Large increases in labour will be needed; for instance, the upkeep of aerodromes not only on account of enemy action but also on account of weather conditions is a commitment which is certain to grow.
Transportation.6. The transportation of troops, equipment and supplies has proceededpractically without a hitch. During the period the following have been shipped:  --	Personnel Nos.	M.T. Vehicles Nos.	Ammn. D.W. tons	Petrol D.W. tons	General Stores D.W. tonsSeptember October Total	130,000 50,000	22,000 7,000	1.9,000 31,000	18,000 25,000	37,000 70,000	*i8o,ooo	29,000	50,000	43,000	107,000* Including R.A.F. personnel.A greater tonnage of general stores could have been shipped had there beenaccommodation to receive it.II. Garrisons and Defended Ports AbroadFormations and Personnel.7. The 4th Indian Division (less one Brigade), despatched on the outbreakof war to reinforce the British Troops in Egypt, has arrived at its destination.8. Some 6,000 trained men have been despatched since mobilization fromthe United Kingdom to garrisons and ports in the Mediterranean, Near Eastand Malaya. This reinforcement for all practical purposes meets the GeneralStaff requirements for these garrisons.9. Orders have been issued which will result in the early dilution of trained personnel in the garrisons abroad by officers and other ranks of Territorialunits stationed at home, who will thus complete their training overseas.III. A.D.G.B.10. During the period under review the following A.A. guns were issued to A.D.G.B.:  \-inch	3 - j-inch	nch                2-pcirs. 4 5 tnc 1         (single and twin)	Nil	46	I 84                        9	On the other hand sixty 3-inch guns were transferred from A.D.G.B. to the British Expeditionary Force. Of these 12 were lost at sea, but have subsequently been salved and will be re-issued in due course. On 31st October the number of A.A. guns on the strength of A.D.G.B. was as follows:  			y-tuck	3 - &quot;j-inch	4 -^-inch	2,-pdrs. (single and twin)360	258	188	11IV. Other Troops in the United KingdomFormations and Personnel.11. These forces totalled at the end of the month something like 616,000,including Coast Defence 11,000, National Defence Companies 20,000, some160,000 men with training units and the balance with H.Q. staffs, establishments and Field Force formations. The number with A.D.G.B. was 124,000, so thatthe total in the United Kingdom was about 740,000.
12. A plan involving the use of eight of the divisions at home and theist Armoured Division has been worked out to meet the threat of invasion.Due regard, however, has been paid to the importance of disturbing as little as possible the arrangements made for despatching troops to France and fortraining.13. Voluntary enlistment was opened during the period to non-tradesmenin the fighting units, Service tradesmen, National Defence Companies and labourunits (Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps) at various ages ranging between 22and 50. Since mobilization the number of voluntary recruits accepted hasamounted to 55,000, and 78,000 Militia and Army class have been called up.On the other hand, the comb-out of the Territorial Army will probably result inthe loss of approximately 12,000 either on return to industry or on medical grounds while, in addition, temporary releases have deprived the Army of nearly16,000 officers and men.   Some of these, however, are now becomi lable.V. GeneralEquipment.14. Forecasts from the Ministry of Supply have just been received forcertain major items which are being subjected to close scrutiny in the light ofcalculated requirements and present stocks.Stores.15. The great-coat situation has improved very considerably. They arenow coming forward at the rate of 50,000 a week, and the Ministry of Supplyhopes to improve on this. Difficulties have been or are being overcome in special winter clothing, gum boots, web equipment, portable cookers, steelhelmets, blankets and ground sheets.16. Clothing already despatched to France represents 66 per cent, of theauthorized reserves. The full decontamination reserve should be completed within the next few weeks.17. The following proportions of the authorized reserves of fuel andlubricants have been accumulated to date : --	Petrol	Light Diesoleum             Lubricants 1Now in hand   ...
