(39)  4S .WAR CABINET.1 IT3 I a third Fortnightly Report submitted by the Secretary of Statefor India covering the period 1st to 14th October,1939.(Previous Reports Paper Ho.W.P.R.(39)  5 and   (59) 52).During the fortnight under review the attention ofpolitical India has been almost exclusively directed to thediscussion of the conditions made from entirely differentstandpoints by the Congress and the Moslem Leaguerespectively for their co-operation in war measures and asto the response which should be made to them.    Throughoutthe period also the Governor-General has been engaged insounding, in personal interviews, the views of a number of leaders of the various Parties and interests.    The WarCabinet have been made fully aware of the situation by myrecent memoranda on the subject, and at the end of last weekthey examined in detail the Governor-General&apos;s finalProposals for the statement to be made by him. this statement is being published in India and in this countryGeneral.

to-day, and it remains to be seen what effects it will produce.    I need only observe that, as matters stand, the salient  outcome  of the discussions of the past few weekshas been the emphasis laid by the Moslems and the otherIndian minorities on their unwillingness to contemplate theextension in India of any form of self-government that wouldin their view involve their domination by the majority.2.    Military.There is no change in the situation as regards theArmy or the Royal Air force in India,  or the Royal IndianNavy.3.    foreign and Frontier Relations.Afghanistan.        Negotiations in regard to the projected Agreement for mutual assistance continue and the text of the proposed Agreement will shortly be put to theAfghan Government.      It is reported that 40 Mullahs from indian tribal territory are going to Afghanistan on theirown initiative to discuss the situation arising out of thewar.North-West frontier.      firm action is being taken toput pressure on the Afridis to surrender the three principalAfghan refugees who were responsible for the abortive Afridiattack on Afghanistan referred to in last fortnight&apos;s Report.North-West frontier Province.        The improvement inthe situation in Bannu district has been maintained.Sinkiang.      The Consul-General at Kashgar has receiveda demand for the immediate closing down of his wirelessinstallation from the Administrative Commissioner who has stated that he is acting  on orders received from the Chinese

Central Government.        The closing down of trie wirelessinstallation would cut the Consul-General off from all meansof rapid c ommunication with India and the outside world, and strong representations are Toeing made to the Chinese CentralGovernment with a view to the withdrawal of the order.    TheChinese Central Government have denied having issued such orders to the provincial Government, but it is possiblenevertheless that they may have done so,  either in retaliationfor the closing down of a Chinese wireless station in HongKong or as the result of pressure from the Soviet authorities.Persian Gulf.        The Sheikh of Bahrein has presented thesun of  30,000 to His hajesty&apos;s Government for war purposes asa sign of his sympathy and gratitude for the protection of theBritish Government.      This generous gift has been suitablyacknowledged by His majesty&apos;s Government.4-    Indian States.The Jam Sahib  of Pawanagar,  Chancellor  of the Chamber of princes, has been called  into consultation by the Viceroy inconnection with his proposals for associating States&apos;representatives and British Indian party leaders with his plans for co-ordinating and promoting India&apos;s war efforts.The situation remains generally quiet in the States but is characterised as one of expectant uncertainty.    There is evidence&apos; that Congress, while at present preoccupied with its attitude towards the war, has not abandoned its &quot;policy of producing disaffection in States administered on old-fashionedlines.    There is also sane revival of communed, feeling inHyderabad and Jaipur.      The Rulers of certain States bordering0n Orissa and the Centra.! Provinces where a revival ofagitation is anticipated are being urged to press on with.necessary reforms.

With the King&apos;s approval the Viceroy has  constituted a War Purse Fund into which the considerable contributions which are still being received from many Rulers are being paid with a view to their expenditure on the advice of aCommittee on beneficent   objects  connected with the indian forces when not earmarked for specific purposes.    Potablecontributions include  100,000 from the Nizam of Hyderabadto the Air ministry towards the prosecution of aerialwarfare together with a promise to meet the cost  ofmaintenance of a regiment  of State Cavalry and  a battalion of State Infantry with the British Forces in India, and fromthe Jam Sahib  of Nawanagar an undertaking to contribute one-tenth of his annual revenue towards war expenses.5 -     F c on cm i c .In the early days of the war profiteering was attemptedin India on a considerable  scale.       This affected both theinternal markets, upon which the cost of living depends,  andsome of the commodities the export of which is important forthe purpose  of military supplies.      Steps were taken in somecases to  control prices  or to regulate exports and in othersby means  of severe warning to members  of the tradingcumnunity.      These measures were to a considerable extenteffective;    the rise of prices was in many cases checked, andin same a reduction occurred.       Some increase of prices isProbably inevitable and even beneficial from the point of viewof the economic and political situation in India.    But more drastic measures are likely to be required  in due course tomaintain a, moderate level of prices.Plans which have been referred to in previous reports-or the mobilisation  of India&apos;s resources and for assisting the supply reqpuirements of the Empire and Allied Governments,

and for supporting the prosecuti.cn of economic warfare ,arebeing more fully developed.    Jute, being a monopoly ofIndia and a commodity which is in great demand for war purposes,  is an outstanding example of the resources of indian this connection.      Exports of jute to Germany have,  ofcourse, been cut off;    exports to the adjacent neutral countries are being restricted to the level  of their normal trade, and the supplies which a/re thus rendered availableare being used to meet the requirements of the Empire and her Allies.      Orders placed  in India on behalf of the UnitedKingdom since the outbreak of war amount to 212 millionsandbags and 14 million yards of jute cloth, and further large orders are likely to be placed in the near  future.6.    Finance.The Central Government&apos;s Budget estimates for 1939-40showed a surplus,  of nominal amount,  of revenue overexpenditure.      Additional war expenditure is already being incurred;     and it  is not yet known whether, and  if so to what extent, net improvements under other heads will contribute towards meeting this.    It  is not intended to introduce a supplementary Budget this year, but  the annual Budget for1940-41 would in the ordinary course be introduced about theend of February.      It should by then be possible to form somejudgment of the effect  of the war on India&apos;s economy andfinances, and any additional fiscal burdens which in thelight of this mag&apos; be deemed necessary are likely to be politically more acceptable.The rupee exchange has shown strength:    the London T.T.selling rate on Calcutta, which from before the outbreak ofv;ar bad remained steady at ls.5JpLd,  advanced on the 5thOctober to ls.6-id, and was  still at that rate  on the 13th

-......6.October.    The sterling resources of the Reserve Rank ofIndia have been further strengthened;     on the 7th october the total holding  (issue and Banking departments combined)was  13 million higher than on the 18th August.Z.Richmond Terrace,  S.W.1,October 17th, 1939.
