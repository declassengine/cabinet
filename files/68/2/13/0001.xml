nfJJMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)WAR cabinet civil DEFENCE REPORT NO.5 +Fifth Report submitted, by the Ministerof Home Security covering the period from midnight 1st October to midnight 15th October,  1959.Air Raid Precautions Services,1.   The lines upon which the AoR.Po  services can be organised with greater economy of man power and money, but without weakeningpreparedness, have now been settled in consultation with regional commissioners   (see paragraphs 1-4 of Home Security Report No,-, 2.(W.P. (R) (39)10)) and instructions on the subject are being issued tolocal authorities on Friday, 20th October^Lighting Restrictions.2.   The experiments on reduced street lighting referred to inparagraph 2 of Home Security Report No, 4 (W.P, (R) (39)36) were not held to justify any modifications in the existing restrictions.      Areport on this and other aspects of the lighting restrictions isbeing submitted by the Ministerial Committee on Lighting Restrictions.(a)  Children&apos;s respirators and^ Jciabies ^ protective helmets.3.   The distribution of this equipment is proceeding as rapidly assupplies will allow.      Approximately 560,000 babies&apos; helmets havenow been distributed, amounting to about 40 per cent of the total*    Reports Nos.1-4 were entitled Home Security Reports.(Previous Report:    Paper No.W.P;(R)(39) 36)Supplies.

requirements of the country, including ncn-vulnerable areas.About 200,000 children&apos;s respirators will have been distributedby the end of the week, and although difficulties of productionand the collection of accurate statistics on which distributioncan be based have inevitably delayed issue9 it can be said thatin the most vulnerable areas a large proportion of the childrenfor whom the respirator was designed can now be protected.(b)  Si&quot;eel shelters.4.    The distribution of domestic steel shelters is being maintained at an average rate of about 50,000 a week.      Urgentdemands from the Services make it necessary to reduce by alittle the supply of sheets for these shelters, but a smallerunit - for four persons      of the same specification in every respect, is being introduced within the next few days inaddition to the present  (for six-persons) standard unit.      as many households consist of four or less members, the introduct-ion of the smaller shelter will not necessarily reduce thetotal number of persons protected, by each week&apos;s deliveries.Emergency Fire Brigade^ Measures.5c    The proposals for the manning of the Auxiliary Fire Service,contained in the circular letter of the 29th September, havebeen well received by fire authorities;,      While in some cases,proposals to reduce- the numbers of whole-time paid personnelmay have gone too far, the general tendency has been to pay due regard to the need to be ready to meet possible eventualities.Already about 600 returns, setting out their proposals, havebeen received from fire authorities throughout the country.Casualty Sev;vices g.6.    On Sunday, October 15th, the number of vacant beds inEngland and Wales was some 176,000.. showing a reduction of

1 U :J5,000 on the figure for October 1st.      The reflux of ordinarysick is, therefore, proceeding steadily.in Scotland 12,400 beds were available.7.    It is estimated that, at the present rate, fully  100,000a week will be paid to voluntary hospitals for the beds keptempty during September and October.8.    The construction of hutted hospitals is progressing well.It is estimated that, by the end of October, 9420 huts will beroofed and walled.9.    It has been agreed that the Ministry of Health shall assumedirect responsibility for the organisation of the pathologicallaboratories, including the public health laboratories, being established in the London Sectors.      A Sector Pathologist hasbeen appointed in each Sector and he will be responsible forthe organisation and supervision of the work.10. Outside London, the Medical Research Council have undertakenresponsibility for the maintenance of the emergency publichealth laboratory services.Evacuation.11. Arrangements have been authorised for the evacuation of35,000 additional school children from the evacuating areas inEngland, and 11,000 in Scotland.12. Of the 46,000 children involved, 8,000 are from the LondonCounty Council area, 1,100 from Croydon, 6,500 from Lancashire,4,500 from Yorkshire, 1,500 from Cheshire, 1,000 fromNorthumberland, 1,300 from Durham County, 3,700 from Birmingham,Smethwick and Coventry, and 1,800 from Portsmouth, Southamptonand Gosport, 5,700 from Glasgow, 3,900 from Edinburgh, 1,000from Dundee.13* In some districts the movement has been proceeding during

the past weeks      The new movement is not taking place in onestage.      As &quot;billets become ready and transport is arranged,parties of school children are despatched according to arrangements made between the evacuating area and the receivingarea, under the general direction of the Ministry of Health andtheir Regional staffs014. Arrangements are being made to link up the children withtheir school units which moved out a month agoD15. All children are being medically inspected.16,  In a circular letter issued by the Minister of Health tolocal authorities on the 2nd October the importance is emphasised of extending the existing health services inreceiving areas to cover the needs of school children and others who have been evacuated under the official Scheme0      As this isimpossible in most cases without additional staff, theevacuating authorities are urged to give the utmost possible assistance by releasing such staff - for instance, medical officers, school dentists, nurses, midwives and health visitors -as may be practicable, at least as a temporary measure.      where an arrangement of this kind cannot be made and additional staff has to be engaged to cope with the needs of the evacuatedpopulation^ the cost will not fall on the receiving authority.A circular in similar terms will be issued shortly by theDepartment of Health for Scotland,17o Many representations have been received that the billetingallowances for unaccompanied school children (10/6d per week forone child or 8/6d per week for each child where more than one is received)  are insufficient for the maintenance of the olderchildren^      It has been decided to increase the payment inrespect of  UfppW,ompanied boys and girls of 16 years and overto l0/6d a week in all cases, and an announcement to this effect was made by the Minister of Health in the House of Commons on

the 5th October.18. On the 4th October, the Minister of Health announced inthe House of Commons that the Government had decided tointroduce a scheme whereby a reasonable proportion of the costof billeting school children should be recovered from the parents.      Circulars have been issued to the local authoritiesdealing with this subject.public Order.19. Public order and morale continue to be excellent and thepublic have settled down to war conditions.      Anti-Warpropaganda is said to be ineffective, and the German broadcastsare received with amusement.      The Peace Pledge Union is themost active pacifist organisation, but pacifist leaflets havealso been circulated by the British Council for ChristianSettlement in Europe, an organisation of which John Beckett,the former Fascist, is Secretary, and there is sporadicpropaganda against the war on pro-Soviet and anti-imperialistgrounds.20. A number of Chief Constables report that there is a generalanxiety for fuller information, especially about the fighting forces, though the necessity for a censorship is recognised.Railways.21. Cheap day return fares were restored on all railways as from monday, 9th October.22. A substantial and increasing freight traffic, coupled withlonger hauls due to the diversion of ships, is beginning to throw a heavy burden on the wagon capacity of the railways.Proposals for securing a speedier circulation of wagons arebeing examined by the Ministry of Transport in consultationwith other Departments concerned.

23. Experiments aimed at securing &quot;better lighting of marshallingand goods yards have resulted in recommendations which havegenerally been approved by the Ministerial Committee on Lighting,and steps are being taken to give early effect to theserecommendationso24. Experiments in train lighting are being continued.Docks and Harbours.25. The position remains satisfactory - generally there is nopressure on storage accommodation and no serious raildifficulties have been reportedo26. On 13th October steps were taken, on the advice of theAdmiralty, to secure the maximum diversion from East to West.Until further advice is received, trans-ocean British shippingcoming from the West will not be received in London or otherEast Coast ports unless there are overwhelming reasons to thecontrary, e.g. meat ships v/hose cargoes are very urgently required in London.Road Transport.27.  In general the situation remains satisfactory and unchangedas regards both goods and passenger road transport.28. On the passenger side the pressure at weekends on ordinaryservices by parents of evacuated children is becoming greater.On the goods side the gradual tightening up of fuelrationing has not so far caused any serious difficulties.29. The fuel rationing of goods and public service vehicles willbe put on a fortnightly basis as from the 20th October.      Thiswill reduce the amount of work involved in the rationing of fuelfor these vehicles.Alternative Accommodation for Government Staffs.30. There have been further moves of staffs to the Provinces,

Ministry of Home Security       45 staff to Leamington Spa.(National CamouflageEs tabli s hment)Other moves will take place in the near future coveringapproximately 2,500 staff.31. Work on AoR.P. protection for the alternative War Rooms ofthe War Cabinet, Service Ministries, and the Ministry of home security continues, but authority has not yet been given forthe provision of protection for other staffs.32. Authority has not yet been given to requisition alternative accommodation for Parliament in the Provinces.33. The question of the erection of temporary buildings as a substitute for some of the accommodation requisitioned is being actively pursued.J.A.
