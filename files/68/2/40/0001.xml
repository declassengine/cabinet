*5 O O6 u 0WEEKLY REPORT ON ACTION TAKENI.    War Trade Agreements and Relations with Neutral countries the outstanding event of this week has &quot;been theinitialling of the Norwegian Shipping Agreement, whichis, however, more the concern of the Ministry of Shippingthan of this Ministry.      The Swedish negotiations arenow nearly finished;    those with the Netherlands. belgian and Icelandic Delegations continue.      Much useful work has been done through the Anglo-Italian Joint Committeein Rome, but the British members of the Committee have drawn attention to the serious danger that vitalopportunities will be lost by delays in London intaking decisions, particularly about purchases.Preparations are now being made for negotiations withHungary:, Bulgaria, Roumania and Yugoslavia.      The stageis practically set for introducing the Navicert system in the U.S.A.    the Argentine, Uruguay and Brazil onDecember 1st2.      The situation in the various countries isbriefly as follows:SWEDEN3-      The War Trade Agreement with Sweden is very nearly settled.      Since the approval of its main lines tthe War Cabinet, the comments of the Swedish Governmenthave been received.     For the most part they do not present:any great difficulty,  and the text of the Protocol, withthe Swedish and British Declarations attached, has nowbeen virtually agreed, while the text of the &quot;Instructionsto the Standing Commission&apos;&apos; has also reached an advanced stage.h.      The main concessions for which the swedish government ask concern the export of materials toGermany/

Germany for processing and subsequent use in Swedish,manufactures, and the delivery to Germany of quantitiesof German deficiency materials equivalent to the quantities used in certain German exports to Sweden,especially electrical machinery.      It is expectedthat it will be necessary to go some way to meet theSwedish Government&apos;s wishes,  and that this can be done without serious difficulty;, since the quantities involvedseem, from a preliminary and cursory survey, to beunimportant.     Complete lists of the commodities and quantities in question are now awaited.      There is one further point on which the Swedish Government are notat present satisfied, namely the maintenance of Swedishexports to the United Kingdom and British colonial empire, which have suffered from import restrictions.Some concession on this point v/ill probably also benecessary.NORWAY5. The Agreement between the representatives ofthe Norwegian Ship-owners and the Ministry of Shippingv/as initialled on the 11th November.6.      The Norwegian Minister in London has statedthat his Government do not wish officially to ratify theShipping Agreement in order that they can maintain to theGerman Government that it is a business arrangement between the Norwegian Ship-owners and British Charterersand that it is entirely distinct from any War trade agreement which may be later concluded between the twoGovernments.      At the same time,  the Norwegian Governmentare anxious to reserve the right of denouncing theShipping Agreement should negotiations for a War trade agreement break down or be unduly prolonged.      Withthis/

The Shipping Agreement having now been concluded,the Norwegian Government have been asked to send a furtherMission to London empowered to negotiate and conclude a War Trade Agreement,8.      Negotiations for a War Trade Agreement have become the more urgent since Norway has recentlyrefused to grant Export Licences to the United kingdom for Aluminium and Ferro-Alloys on the grounds that sales of these commodities to the United Kingdom are inexcess of the pre-war level.      All these commodities are dependent for their manufacture on sea-borne rawmaterials controlled or supplied by the Allies-  and, inthe case of Aluminium,  the capital of the Norwegiancompanies concerned is wholly controlled by the Alliesexcept in the case of one company where the Allies own50;/.ICELAND9.

AFGHANISTAN28.      Germany is reported, to &quot;be eager to secureAfghanistan cotton and is offering high prices for it.On political grounds the Foreign Office are pressingthat means should &quot;be found to dispose of this cotton onthe English market.     This, or pre-emption, wouldappear to be the only solution. since we are unable tocontrol contraband passing across the Afghan-Russianfrontier.      On the other hand, the problem of transport would appear to present difficulties for Germany.JAPAN29.     An inter-departmental meeting to discuss a war trade Agreement is being arranged.U .S .A .
