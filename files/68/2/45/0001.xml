(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT)secret . P . (R) ( 3 9 ) 85, c o p y No . ^/fTgf^LFIFTH FORTNIGHTLY REPORT submit tod by the Secretary ofState for India covering the period 1st to 15th November,1959.(Previous Report - Paper W.P,(R)(39) 66).The War Cabinet considered at length on 6th november the general political situation in India&quot;&apos;; and in pursuantof their discussions I made a considered statement on theposition as it then stood on the following day in theHouse of Lords, the substance of which was simultaneouslycommunicated to the House of Commons.    For convenience ofrecord I append to this Report a copy of my statement.There is little that I can add to the facts at thattime in the possession of the War Cabinet.   On variousdates between 30th October and 10th November theresignations tendered by the Ministries in seven of the eight Provinces in which the Congress had previously beenin power were accepted by the Governors of thoseProvinces, who thereupon, as the only resource availableto them in the absence of alternative Ministries in aposition to command- the support of the Legislatures,issued Proclamations under section 93 of the Act wherebythey assumed to themselves all powers executive and legislative which are necessary to conduct theadministration of their respective Provinces.   The one&apos;

HI 0- 2 -exception is the province of Assam.   The iviinistrytendered its resignation on the 15th November, butaccording to my latest information there is still some slight possibility of an alternative ministry with adequatesupport in the Legislature becoming available.It now remains to be seen to what extent the LeftWing elements of the Congress will succeed in engineeringresistance to the Governors&apos; administration in the variousProvinces.    It seems clear that Mr. Gandhi&apos;s influence overCongress policy, so far as he succeeds in exercising it,will be in the direction of moderation, and that he isdesirous of avoiding anything in the nature of a civildisobedience campaign, which he rightly assumes wouldrapidly degenerate into violence.    The Viceroy is at themoment in consultation with the Governors as to the generalpolicy which should inform their administration, and,although he has not yet communicated to me his specific proposals, he recognises the importance of avoiding any action which could be criticised as a reversal or slowing down of the main features of the policy of the lateMinistries.II. MILITARY APFaI7?3There has been no further movement of troops overseasfrom India since the last report.The Ministry of Supply have intimated that they will wish to use all the capacity available in India, surplus to indian requirements, for items forming part of theMinistry&apos;s programme for the production of arms andammunition.As a beginning, they have placed an order on india for a further 260,000 rounds of H.E. ammunition of variouscalibres.

There is no change in the situation as regards theRoyal Air Force in India.Ill.    FOREIGN AND FRONTIER RELATIONS,Afghanistan.The British Minister at Kabul has had a further discussion with the Afghan Prime Minister and ForeignMinister on the subject oi Anglo-Afghan relations andspoke to them on the lines indicated in last fortnight&apos;sreport.    The Prime Minister expressed his deep gratitudefor the attitude adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government andpromised his fullest co-operation.   He readily agreed to consult His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to anydevelopments in his country&apos;s relations with Russia.   BothMinisters appeared to be somewhat reassured as to theRussian attitude.    This was due partly to the apparentdesire of the Soviet Government not to Involve themselvesin the present struggle; partly to the effect of theAnglo-Turkish Agreement, and partly to reassuringintelligence from the northern borders of Afghanistanwhich indicated a complete absence of preparations foraggression or of troop concentrations.The question of the purchase by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of Afghan cotton was discussed at an inter-departmental meeting on the 10th November.   There was considerable support at the meeting for the view that itwould be politically desirable to assist the AfghanGovernment in this way and the matter is now underconsideration by the Treasury.No r th - We s t Fr o n t i e r.All the Afghan refugees in British tribalterritory who were responsible for the recent abortive

movement against Afghanistan have now been surrendered tothe British authorities.Slnfclang.No settlement of the wireless question has yet beenreached.Nepal.The contingent oi 8,000 Nepalese troops offered forgarrison duty in India is to be sent in two batches, thefirst starting on the 2 5th November and the second on the25th January 1940,IV.    INDIAN STATESNil.V.    economic the monsoon season which has recently closed in india is reported as having been generally favourable, thoughthe rainfall was deficient in the north-western area,including the Punjab, the North-West Frontier Province,Sind, Kashmir, Pajputana and the northern part of Bombay,including the Kathiawar peninsula.   Much of the cottongrown in India is in this region and the area under thiscrop shows a decrease of 20 per cent, as compared with thepreceding year.    The out-turn of jute, which mostly comes from Bengal, is expected to be between 5 and 10 per cent,better than last year.   There is an increase ofapproximately 13 per cent, in the area under the summercrop of groundnuts;    supplies of hides and skins and theproduction of wool are said to be normal.Serious anxiety was caused in the early weeks of thewar by the activities of profiteers and for a short time-

some of the internal prices -wore raised to excessivelevels.   This development was, however, met by counter-measures of a more or less drastic nature in most partsof India, and satisfactory information continues to bereceived as to the effect of these measures.VI.    FRANCE.There has been nothing specially noteworthy toreport during the fortnight under review.   The Rupeeexchange has continued fairly strong, the London T.T.selling rate on Calcutta having remained steady at l-s.6Lr.-d,(Initialled)    z.Richmond Terrace, 3.W.1.16th November 1939.

9 oi ^t*   &quot;JANNEXUREHOUSE OF LORDSPRIVATE-NOTICE QUESTION DATED 7th NOVEMBER&apos; 1939.Lord Snell:    To ask whether His Majesty1s Government have any statement to make on the position in India asdisclosed by the announcement and correspondencepublished by the Governor-General which appeared inMonday&apos;s newspapers.ANSWER TO THE LORD SNELL&apos;S PRIVATE-notice question DATED 7th NOVEMBER 1939.The Marquess of Zetland:I need hardly say that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshare the profound regret of the Governor-General atthe failure of consultations which he has been holdingduring the last week to produce an agreement between representatives of the Congress on the one hand and ofthe All-India Moslem League on the other.    I mayremind the House briefly that the previous discussions which the Governor-General had been so patientlyconducting for several weeks past had convinced him that there was little, if any, prospect of securing agreement on plans which he had been considering withthe object of bringing Indians into association withthe Central Government of India in the conduct of thewar unless some accommodation could first be reachedof the difficulties felt by the Moslems as to their position in the Provinces where Congress governments were in power.   As the House will have seen from the documents published yesterday, the Congress definitely

refuses to consider any concrete plans such as thoseoutlined by the Governor-General unless His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should be willing first to make a declaration to the effect that India is an independent nation, andthat His Majesty&apos;s Government will raise no opposition toher future form of government being determined without their intervention by a Constituent Assembly to be formedon the widest possible basis of franchise, and by agree-ment in regard to communal representation.    The Congresshave further consistently taken the line, which they stillmaintain, that the fact that there are racial anareligious minorities in India is of no relevance in thatconnection and that it has always been the intention ofthe Congress to secure, through the Constitution to be framed by Indians themselves, such protection for their rights as may prove acceptable to the minorities.His Majesty&apos;s Government find it impossible to accept this position.    The long-standing British connection with india has left His Majesty&apos;s Government with obligations towards her which it is impossible for them to shed bydisinteresting themselves wholly in the shaping of her future form of government.   Moreover one outstandingresult of the recent discussions in which the Governor-General has been engaged with representatives of all parties and interests in India has been to establishbeyond doubt the fact that a declaration in the sense proposed, with the summary abandonment by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of their position in India,would be far fromacceptable to large sections of the Indian population.But this does not mean that we have in any senseweakened in our determination to assist India by suchmeans as are in our power to reach without avoidable delay the position in the British Commonwealth of Nations to

which we are pledged,   And let me take this opportunityof removing some doubts and suspicions which appear tohave been felt in India about the reference in the recentIndian debate by my right honourable Friend, the lord privy Seal, to &quot;the Dominion Status of 1926&quot; as being thestatus we contemplate for India.    The suggestion, Iunderstand, has been made that the passage of the statute of Westminster in 1931 has produced for the Dominions towhich that Statute applies a status which somehow differs from, and is superior to, the relationship described inthe &quot;Balfour Declaration&quot; contained in the Report of theImperial Conference of 1926.   This House at ail eventswill have no difficulty in believing me when I say thereis no foundation for any such suggestion.   My right honourable Friend referred to &quot;the Dominion Status of1926&quot; because it was in that year that the ImperialConference described the status of the Dominions, and thestatus so described has not been altered by anything whichhas since occurred, the Statute of Westminster havingmerely given legal effect to certain consequences of theconstitutional position as then recognised.    It was ourhope that the plans which the Governor-General had indicated, including as they did the incorporation of leaders of the main political parties in the CentralGovernment, if they could have been brought into playwould have done much towards facilitating the removal ofthe outstanding obstacle at present in India&apos;s path.   TheGovernor-General has made it clear that he is not deterredby his present failure from hoping for a reconsiderationby the parties interested, and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwarmly approve the readiness which he has expressed to beof such service as he can whenever opportunity offers.

911o* ^Meanwhile, the position at the moment is that in bengal, the Punjab and Bind the Ministries, which in thoseProvinces do not owe allegiance to the Congress Party,remain in office;  in five of the remaining eight Provinceswhere Congress Governments have been in power those governments have now resigned; and in the other threeProvinces the Governments are expected to resign in thevery near future.    There appears to be in one Province -Assam - a possibility of an alternative Government.   but with this one exception the Governors have found, or willvery shortly find, themselves with no option, sincealternative Ministries in a position to command theconfidence of the Legislature are not forthcoming, but toassume to themselves by proclamation the powers whichprovisions in the Act enable them to assume in such a situation.    But let me make it plain that section 93 ofthe Act under which this action has been taken is in no sense a penal provision;  it simply provides the machinery,the possible necessity for which Parliament in its wisdomforesaw if, to quote the words of the net, &quot;a situation has arisen in which the government of the Province cannotbe carried on in accordance with the provisions of thisAct&quot;, for carrying on The King&apos;s government.    It is ourhope that,  in the absence of opposition from the supporters of Congress or from other quarters, the Governors with the aid of their official advisers and the members of thePublic Services will succeed in conducting smoothly and efficiently the administration of the provinces, thedifference being - obviously a very fundamental difference- that their actions will be decided in responsibility tothis Parliament and not in pursuance of advice tendered tothem by Ministers responsible to a Provincial Legislature.

321 HPWe greatly regret that the Ministries which have with somuch zeal been carrying on the government of their greatProvinces and tackling with energy and resource the many problems with which administration has naturally broughtthem into contact should have found it necessary to withhold their further services from their country.   Butwe refuse to believe that this withdrawal will be forlong, and we shall continue to hope, so long as any grounds for such hope remain, that the proclamations bythe Governors need have only a temporary duration, for Ican assure your Lordships that the Governors will be onlytoo ready to recall to their counsels responsibleadvisers as soon as they are available.
