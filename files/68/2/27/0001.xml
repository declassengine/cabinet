(This Document is the Property of his Britannic Ma jesty&apos;s JlGovernment) .SECRET.,/.P.(R)   (39)   67 Copy No.      HOAR CABINET.BURMA.Fourth Periodical Report submitted by the Secretary ofState for Burma,  covering the period 15th to31st October,  1939.(Previous Report Paper No. 0&apos;.P. (r)  (39) 49.)1o GeneraloThe country generally remains quiet.My third periodical report on the situation in Burma(\/.P. (R)   (39)   49)  dated 17th October mentioned that Dr. Ba Maw,the ex-Premier,  had formed a &quot;Freedom bloc&quot; ,  the demands ofwhich, as the condition for Burma1s whole-hearted    co-operation in the war, are (l)   the recognition by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentof Burma&apos;s right to determine her own form of government     (s)the summoning of a Constituent Assembly to frame a constitutionacceptable by the people of Burma;    (3)   as an Immediate measurepending (2),   the Governor to be required to be guided by theadvice of Ministers in all matters,   including Defence.The Freedom bloc has been carrying on active propagandin support of its policy which has been given prominence and aconsiderable measure of support by the Burmese vernacular Pressbut a much advertised mass meeting held in Rangoon on the 22ndOctober was attended by only about 3,000 people and no greatenthusiasm was displayed.      The Governor has recently receivedfrom the Freedom bloc a request for the  immediate summoning of the Legislature on the ground - which shows a certainsimilarity to  the grounds on which the Indian Congress hastaken its stand. - that Burma has been involved in tho : far

by His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s declaration of war without anyproper steps having been taken to ascertain the attitude of the burma Legislature to the V/ar.      The Governor intimates thathe may have to summon the Legislature for an extra sessionhut,  if so,  this stop will he taken in view of the amountof urgent business requiring disposal and not with referenceto the Freedom bloc&apos;s request.My report of 17th October also mentioned that theCouncil of Ministers,  anticipating that the Viceroy&apos;s statement to India would promise some measure of &quot;constitutional advance&quot;,had presented a minute disavowing any desire  to follow the example of the Indian Congress,  whose bargaining tactics theycondemned, but nevertheless asking, in effect,  for an equalmeasure of &quot;advance&quot; for Burma. Sir A. Cochrane, by informal discussion with his Ministers on linos whioh I had suggested to him,  succeeded in persuading them, for the moment,  that conditions in India are so different from those affecting Burmathat the issue of a statement in India need not call forParallel action in relation to Burma,  and that it would bewell at any rate to wait and see what the Viceroy&apos;s statementcontained.Two of the Ministers declared in the Burmese Press,subsequently to the publication of the Viceroy&apos;s statement,that Burma ought to have an equally sympathetic message fromor in the name of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Sir A. Cochrane had a further informal discussionwith his Ministers on 23rd October on  the question of the needfor a statement to Burma.      The line which he  took was thatthe Constitution given to Burma by the Act of 1935 carriesthe seeds of its own growth.&quot;    that its development will berelative to the success with which Ministers perform thefunctions allotted to them;     and that the best way to achieve

constitutional advance for Burma would bo by Ministers provingToy their actions that they can undertake with success the duties with which they are at present charged and are fit toundertake fresh responsibilities.      Sir A. Ccchrane believesihat his Ministers really accept    this argument and that fromtheir acceptance of it springs  the ready co-operation which hehas received from them since the outbreak of war.A two-hour discussion of the question on these lines on 23rd October ended in agreement that his Ministers would discuss the matter with the Governor again before   pressinghim to make a statement on the authority of His Majesty&apos;sGovernnent.     But they did ask what they should say when facedwith the question,  &quot;When will Burma attain the constitutionalgoal foreshadowed by the pledge of 20th January 1931, and bythe   Act of 1935 interpreted in the light of the instrument of Instructions?&quot; - an awkward question which the Governorseems to have succeeded in evading for the moment.In view of the need to strengthen his Ministers&apos;hands for the purpose of replying to the propaganda of theFreedom bloc and of proving to the public that they are no less devoted to what are regarded as the nation&apos;s interests,Sir A. Cochrane has all along been of the opinion that it maybe necessary in the end for him to make a statement,  on theauthority of ilis Majesty&apos;s Government, giving assurances forthe future.      That his opinion was justified is shown by thefact that on 31st October the Premier again asked the Governorfor permission to publish the Ministers&apos;   original minute asking or assurances for Burma&apos; s future.      Sir A* Cochrane hasdeferred a definite reply to this request on the ground,which the Premier readily accepted,  that he must  first consult with His Majesty&apos;s Government.      Sir Archibald is   to hoveanother informal conversation with his Premier at orace, but

he doubts whether it is possible- to refuse permission to publish the representations which have boon made by theMinisters, for, if they are not able publicly to show thatthey have made representations in pursuance of &quot;Burma&apos;national interests&quot;,  they will be placed at an obviousdisadvantage when contesting the utterances of the Freedombloc;    so much so that they might, particularly with the example in front of them of the Ministries in the CongressProvinces    in India, fool constrained to resign.     But, if thMinisters arc given permission to  rubllsh their request tothe Governor for assurances in the name of H.M.G.  for burma&apos;s future,  it will evidently be hardly possible to avoidpublication of a reply resting on the authority of H.IVI.-G.The Governor believes that a quite short statement wouldservo the purpose if it reaffirmed the pledge given to Burmain the House of Commons on 20th January 1031 and emphasised the point that the problems in regard to constitutional development in Burma ar   not identical with those of Indiaand may call for different treatment.2 *    D o f o nco Me a s uro s.Stops have been taken to open recruitment to anadditional Territorial Force battalion of the Burma Rifles(12th Burma Rifles).3*    External Relations.Nothing to report.4.
