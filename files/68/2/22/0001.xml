1 * &apos;*t* /-2-Entioninr.In view of the economy effected in gas and electricityconsumption &quot;by the blackouts the rationing percentage has been raised, from 75 to 100 in respect of these two  commodities.      Itis considered necessary to maintain the machinery of rationingin order to prevent excessive consumption and to provide forre Imposing reductions at  short notice if necessary..Prices^No increase in the general level of pithead prices hasbeen authorised^ but an application from the Central council for an increase based on increased wages and other costs is atpresent under examination.The few increases in retail prices have been mainly confined to certain Couth fast  and South Coast areas to cover the increased cost of freight on seaborne coal.      In those areas where this coal competes with railborne supplies theDepartment  is discussing with the trade a scheme to adjust the differences between the two prices.
