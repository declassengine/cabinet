Copy No.WAR CABINET.SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION.THIRD REPORT BY THE AIR MINISTRY.(Previous Report No. W.P.(R)(59)43)The accompanying report on supply and productionshows the position with regard to the supply of all themore important items of equipment of the Royal Air force at the 51st October, 1939,K.W.

O I&quot; ?*fwMONTHLY REPORT (NO.  3) BY THE AIR MINISTRY.ON SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION.Aircraft.1,      The output of aircraft during the month of October1939 was 782 as compared with the planned output of 805.      the deficiency is more apparent than real because, owing to theneed for an increased supply of spare parts to meet war wastagethe Air Ministry instructed firms temporarily to reduce outputof complete machines in order to increase the output of spare parts necessary for the Service     Other factors in the situationare the adverse effect on production of working in artificiallight and the withdrawal of a number of skilled men for theServices.      The increase in the intake of labour since war broke out cannot be reflected in greater output for some little time.2,      The planning of increased productive capacity to fulfil the war programme is proceeding and, since the outbreakof war, orders have been placed in this country for approximately7,000 aircraft which will cost about  112 million, includingthe cost of engines,  turrets, armament and all equipment.3.      As part of the plan for increasing the floor spaceavailable for aircraft construction,  it has been decided toacquire a factory of the Standard Motor Company for the productionof Oxford (trainer) aircraft, and to build a new factory with afloor space of a million square feet to produce aircraft atYeadon aerodrome.     This factory will be planned for continuousoperation with artificial lighting and careful attention willbe paid to camouflage04.      The provision of amphibian and torpedo spotterreconnaissance aircraft to meet the increased requirements ofthe Fleet Air Arm has been fully discussed with representativesof the Admiralty.     Arrangements have been made for alternative/sources,....

iv ^&apos; &apos;Jsources of supply of both types and for increased productivecapacity which will meet Admiralty war requirements at theearliest practicable date.Aero-&quot;Engines.5,     Authority has been given for the erection of a newshadow factory with capacity for the production of 2,000 Sabreengines a year under the management of D. Napier &amp; Sons.      Asuitable site has proved difficult to find, but one has nowbeen selected at West Derby, near Liverpool.      This engine isstill in course of development and is intended for installationin a new type of fighter aircraft.6.     The arrangements for the manufacture of Rolls-royce engines in the motor-car works of the Austin Company (to which reference was made in W.P.(R)(39)16) have boon modified.The Austin Motor Company feel that, with the heavy load of workwhich they have already undertaken in their aero-engine and air-frame Shadow factories, it will not be practicable for them toproceed with the scheme for the manufacture of complete Merlinengines in their motor-car works.      Discussions have taken place with the Pord Motor Company who have agreed in principle to placetheir organisation and resources at the disposal of the AirMinistry for Merlin engine manufacture.      They are investigating the problem in detail and present indications are that they will undertake the production of complete Merlin engines (probably in a new factory, owing to the vulnerable position of theirDagenham works) using the Austin Motor Company as sub-contractorsto the extent that the machine tools in the motor car works ofthe Austin Company are suitable for Merlin engine manufacture.The production of aero-engines is being extended also by theuse of the floor-space,, equipment and labour of the Rolls Roycemotor car works at Derby,7.     Parallel expansion is being arranged of the productionof engine accessories.     During October it was decided:/(a)    to.....

(a) to acquire the Triumph motor car works for theproduction of Hohson carburettors;(b) to establish a large additional source of supply of.T0H0 magnetos;    and(c) to erect at Swindon a new factory for the productionof fuel pumps, engine starters and electricalconduit systems.Armament.8.     A further review of requirements of all forma of armament and armament equipment for the greatly increased war programme has been actively pursued and provision of new productivecapacity is being arranged.9.      For example,  it has been decided to double the capacity for the production of Boulton Paul turrets by increasing the capacity of an existing producer at Birmingham, and establishing a new factory in South Wales.10.    Similarly, in relation to productive capacity for20 mm. cannon guns,  it has been decided to acquire a works inthe Midlands for the necessary expansion.11.    The Air Ministry is in consultation with the Ministryof Supply regarding the supply of small arms ammunition.Requirements of ,.303&quot; ball ammunition alone will amount to aminimum of 8 million rounds a week, whereas it is understoodthat not more than an average of 5 million rounds a week ofall types of c303&quot; ammunition will be available for the RoyalAir Force from the Royal Ordnance Factories over the next sixmonths.12,,   Requirements from the Royal Ordnance Factories of20 mm. cannon gun ammunition which will mature at a later dateamount to 3,600,000 rounds a month, and it is possible that afurther 2 million rounds a month will be necessary in additionto the relatively small quantities being obtained from theBritish Manufacture and Research Company&apos;s factory at Grantham./The.....

fv -cj 0The steps necessary to secure the production of cannon gun ammunition to meet requirements are under discussion betweenthe Air Ministry and the Ministry of Supply.Materials.13.    As stated in W.PU(R)(39)16,  an adequate supply ofmaterials,  in particular of fabricated alloys in the form ofsheet, strip and extrusions,  is fundamental to the success ofthe aircraft programme     For this reason, following thediscussions which have been held with representatives of firms engaged in the light alloy industry,      voluntary scheme has been instituted for the control of the allocation of orders for,and distribution of, fabricated airminium and magnesium alloysso as to ensure the prompt fulfilment of the requirements of theServices.      The scheme is intended to utilise the productivecapacity of the nation to the best advantage and its successdepends upon the co-operation of all firms engaged in tho lightalloy industry.     Four Controllers will be responsible for thevarious sections of the industry, viz.:(a)   Extrusions, tubing and wire.&apos;(b)   Forgings and stampingso(c) Sheet and strip;    and(d) Castings.The Air Ministry is discussing in detail with the Controllersthe arrangements for the economic employment of productivecapacity and its progressive development as the needs of theaircraft programme may require014.    In the meantime, further expansion is proceeding in several directions,,     During the period under review, a 35,000 lb.American hammer, for which a delivery of only 16 weeks was quoted,was secured to expand the productive capacity for light alloyforgings of High Duty Alloys Ltd. at Redditch, and adddtionalcapacity was provided for the production of intricate die castingsby Aeroplane and Motor Aluminium Castings Ltd. at Fort Dunlop.

9 F t)15.    Magnesium production in this country at present    *&quot;J ^ &apos;&quot;Jamounts to some 5,000 tons a year.     As a first step towardsexpanding production threo-fold, as will he necessary whenreserves (equivalent to a year&apos;s supply) are exhausted,arrangements have been made to increase the production ofMurex Ltd. by 4,000 tons a year at a cost of approximately 500,000.Summary.16.    Aircraft.(a) Aircraft output during the month of October 1939was 782 as compared with the planned output of 805.      this figure is explained primarily by the fact that firms woreinstructed to decrease output of complete aircraft in orderto meet the increased war requirements of spares.     (Paragraph l),(b) Since the outbreak of war, orders have been placedin this country for upwards of 7,000 aircraft at a total costof approximately  112 million,,    (Paragraph 2).(c) Further steps have been taken to increaseproductive capacity.     (Paragraph 3).(d) Arrangements have been made for securing the required supplies of amphibian and T.S.R, aircraft for theFleet Air Arm.     (Paragraph 4).17,    Ae r o -Engines.,(a) A site at West Derby, near Liverpool, has been selected for a new factory to produce 2,000 Sabro engines ayear under the management of Da Napier &amp; Sons.    (Paragraph 5).(b) Discussions arc proceeding with the Ford motor company with a view to their undertaking the manufacture ofMerlin engines using the Austin Motor Company as sub-contractors.(Paragraph 6).(c) Productive capacity for engine accessories isbeing expanded.
