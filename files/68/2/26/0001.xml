-p.This document is tbs Pro-party of Pis Britannic Majesty&apos;sCovernment0GhGPIP^P.R.  (R)   (33)   30.- Copy No,WAR CA3UI5T.INDIA.:Fourth Fortnightly Report submitted by the Secretary of Statefor India,  covering the period 15th to 31st October,1959.(Previous Report   Paper W.P.R.  (39)  48).I*    General.My last fortnightly report was submitted to the WarCabinet on the day of the issue of the Governor-General&apos;sstatement ir. reply to the Congress demands as to war aims,Political interest in India has been exclusively directedduring the   past fortnight first to that statement and,  sincethe debate in the House of Commons on 26th October,  to the speech then made by the Lord Privy Seal.      The war cabinet are fully seized,  through their prolonged discussions on 25thOctober,  of the nature and possible ccnscg.uer.ces  of Indianreactions to the Governor-General&apos;s statement,  and they approvedwith1 certain reservations the line of policy indicated by theGovernor. General as the means of attempting to avoid a finaland irrevocable break with the Congress Party.      The position at the moment is that the speech delivered by the Lord privy seal in the course of the debate on 26th October is now therrjarn topic of discussion in India,  and it appears to be generally agreed that,  although the Congress Ministries inthe four Provinces of Madras, Bombay,  the United Provinces andBihar have already tendered their resignations,   that speechaffords the basis for further discussion and negotiation,

which the Governor-General has lost no time in initiating by-issuing an invitation - which has been accepted - to Mr. gandhi and to the Presidents of the Congress and the All-India moslem league to meet him this week in Delhi.The Governor of the United Provinces has so far,  withthe concurrence of his Premier, declined to accept the resignation of his Ministry, nominally on the ground that he himself must be given reasonable time to consider alternatives, but actually in order that the result of the pending discussions may beawaited.      The Governor of Madras has accepted the resignation of his Ministers, but I em not yet aware of the position in bombay.      It v/111 be  realised that wherever the Congress hasa firm majority in the Legislature resignation by the Ministryprecludes the possibility of finding an alternative Ministry,and therefore loaves no course open to the Governor other thanthe carrying on of the Government under his own personalpowers in virtue of a proclamation issued with the concent ofthe Governor-General under section 93 of the Government of india act.2.    Military Affairs.1.    The Government of India have expressed their readiness to place a Division,  organised on a two Brigade basis, at thedisposal of Ills Majesty&apos;s Government if required.      It is hopedthat this Division would be ready by about April 1940.    The offerhas been referred to the Array Council for their consideration.2.    Eighteen and a half Indian Garrison Companies arcbeing raised for service in India.      The formation  of those companies    will enable  infantry units  to bo available for serviceof a more active nature.      Their total strength-will boapprocimately 4,400.3.    The Government of India have offered to place the wholeof their present and future    oxpanded production capacity for

all ordnance and clothing stores at the dispo al of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, loss only those amounts required for the normal peace maintenance of the Army in India and for building up 3months reserves where, still necessary.,      4.    His Majesty&apos;s Government have placed orders on india for 50, 000,000 rounds of 3. A, A -70,000 rounds of 3=7&quot; How. Ammunition.5.   No further units have boon sent overseas beyond those mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Annexiu-c to the report (NooS)for the period September 16th - 30th 1030.0.    There is    no change in the situation as regards theRoyal Air Force in India.3*    Foreign and Frontier Relations.Afghanistan.The Afghan Prime Minister has now informed our Minister-that,  in view of the now situ; it ion cheated by the aggressiveattitude of Soviet Russia, he does not desire to proceed withthe Agreement for which he had ashed.      The Afghan Governmentare apprehensive that the Soviet Ambassador,  who has been on an extended visit to Moscow and is expected to return shortly, may be the bearer of a demand, from the Soviet Government for concessions  in the northern areas of Afghanistan.       They arc-practically anxious therefore at the present time not to do anything which might give offence to Russia.      The Prime Ministerbos however assured Sir Kerr Frnser-Tytler that there need be-no fear of the Afghan Government departing from their existingfriendly attitude tocards us and that he considers that theyere bound to carry out the undertakings contained in the proposalswade to him and trusts that H.M.G.. will do the same.     In thesecircumstances the British Minister at Kabul has been instructed

if the Government of India concur,  to say that H.M.G.  appreciate the   Afghan Govorntnent&apos; s motives and have no desire to -press the matter, &quot;out that they welcome the assurance of continued co-operation and attach particular importance to frankconsultation and information of developments vis-a-vis Russiaand effective surveillance of Germans etc;    at the same time heis to endeavour&apos; to stiffen the Afghan Government&apos;s moralvis-a-vis Russia.Following on the precedent of Egypt the AfghanGovernment has suggested that H.1.6.  might &quot;buy Afghan cottonv/hich would normally hi vo gone to Germany.      This proposal isunder consideration.It is reported that public opinion in Afghanistan hasbeen favourably impressed by the conclusion of the Anglo-TurkishPact.Port h-\7e s t F r on ti er .m m\lo hove not yet learned whether the Afridis have agreedto comply with the demand for the surrender of tho Afghan refugeesreferred to in last fortnight&apos;s summary.North-i/ost Frontier Province.Tho situation in Bdnnu district despite one ortwo recent cases of kidnapping continues to improve graduallyand the frontier constabulary are mooting with greater support and co-operation in tho villages and an increasing readiness to give reliable information.Sinkiang.The Consul-Genoral had an interview with thoAdministrative Commissioner on tho 24th October on the subjectof the demand for the shutting down  of his wireless -installation.The Administrative Commissioner maintained that his demand wasin accordance with instructions convoyed to tho Consul-Generallast January which emanated from the Chinese Central Government,

4 f-t rt1   U&quot;but after discussion he agreed that settlement of this-uestion should he postponed pending the :result of further negotiations in Chungking.      The attitude of the AdministrativeCommissioner was sonic/hat mo.ro conciliatory on this occasionand the Consul-General got the impression that he had receivedfresh instructions of some sorta4o Indian St a be go.It is too early yet for the reaction in the indian states to recent constitutional discussions to he apparent.But in a significant speech made on 22nd October by the Maharajaof Blkaner,  who has great influence with his brother Princes,His Highness said that,  despite the fact fast the Princes haveproblems of their own which require satisfactory solution,their loyal offers of services and co-operation  in the war areunconditional and unqualified and that no sordid motives ofbargain or barter have any place in their thoughts or acts.He appealed to British India to adopt a similar attitude and expressed the view that the martial races of India will once again be eager to fight for the Empire.    He repudiated the claim of the Congress party to speak for the States and indicated that the States would co-operate on the Consultative Committeecontemplated in the Viceroy&apos;s recent statement.The political situation in the States is quiet, butthere remains the possibility of Congress-inspired agitationrestarting,  particularly in the Eastern States and   in Hyderabad.Among the further offers of assistance  in connectionwith the war which have been received is a gift from Hlf&apos;Highness the Maharaja of Gondal of  7,500 to be devoted to  thedependents of those lost in H..M.S.

The whole of the orders now placed inIndia is to be completed by the end of April next.      Inevitablythe price has gone up,  from about 14s/4 per 100 bags for thepresent order, which was an exceptionally favourable priceeven in present conditions, to about :!.8s/4d, which is a tillconsiderably below the Dundee price.      The amount of jute clothcontracted for ir. India has boon raised to 22 million yards,and further orders  are under consideration.
