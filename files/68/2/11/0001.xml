3rd REPORT ON COAL position for period 1st to lhth^October, 1939.p r o due t ion!.Increased output in the Midland coalfields has been offset by seme decrease in Northumberland and Durham owing to shipping difficulties cn the N. E.  Coast.The following statistics are given in accordance with therequest made when the previous report was presented.19&quot;*9                           -	1 Week ending 1 7th October :   (Provi sonal &apos;	Week ending I 30th R to  ^rrh&quot;j fjt* .     ii I Estimated Quantity of        j Saleable Coal Raised        j    h,685,000 Total Quantity of coal shipped abroad x                i        877,000 1 A p p r o x irnate qu a n tity of coal available for Kerne Consumption.                    3,808,000	h, 722,COO 871,000 3,851,0001958ending 8thOctobeFnk,5635O00887,0003,676,000Including the coal equivalent of coke and manufactured fuel,Employment.During the first week of the period covered by the reportthe number of wage earners increased by 2,000 to 752,5C0 but thisis still less by 20,000 than the numbers employed a year agoalthough output was 300,000 tons more.      Reports generallymedicate a scarcity of labour, probably of certain classes only.SdPPlVoSupplies of coal in the consuming districts continue to bein excess of demand and a few minor shortages were easily made good from alternative sources of supply.

0 -)*J ^-2-p^rnjbjation.Rail deliveries are satisfactory &quot;bat there is some delay in,;-,q return of empty wagons due partly to congestion at shippingVolnts and to delayed clearances hy merchants..      Proposals for-needing the latter hy the enforcement of demurrage charges are underconsideration in consultation with the ministry of Transport.Shortage of tonnage  (especially coasting tonnage)  largely dueto voyage delays continues at  all ports.     Attempts are being madecy shippers end merchants to  achieve  some stabilisation of the freight market.Rationing.(i) Coal-Rationing commenced on 1st October.      instructions have been sent to Local Fuel Overseers on the more importantdifficulties arising during the initial stage of rationing.(ii) Gas and Electricity.      In consequence of representations from electricity interests,  a meeting was held between representatives of gas and electricity.      It is hoped that they will agree between themselves any adjustments necessary to secureequality of treatment.Prices o(i)  Inland Prices - There has been no further change in thegeneral level of pithead prices for coal.      Difficulty is being experienced in reconciling authorised increases in colliery pricesDr in the wholesalers&apos; margins with the provisions of existing contracts which do not contain some form of war or cancellationclause.      The difficulty is particularly acute in the case of railwaycontracts with the collieries, which were made some time ago at^pressed prices and by no means represent the level oiT pricesruling immediately prior to the outbreak of war, which is the datum-me for measuring increases of costs.      The question of railv/aycontracts and price increases thereon has been referred to the4 histry of Transport and the Treasury for consideration.      Effortsa&quot;e Doing made to find a solution for the general problem ofcancellable contracts.

-3-Generally speaking,  the retail prices position remainssatisfactory.,      Over the country as a whole few increases in retail prices have taken place,    In certain areas in the South -&quot;last andSouth, it has &quot;been necessary to authorise increases to cover theincreased cost of freight on coal drought coastwise from the NorthEastern coalfields,      Arrangements for pooling prices are &quot;being discussed.,  in an endeavour to avoid hardship to the seabornemerchants while not allowing profiteering on the part of therailborne merchants,(ii) Export Prices - Goal     The principle that increase in price to inland level is fair and reasonable has been accepted by theFrench Goal Mission who have also agreed to the adjustment ofexisting contracts,  subject to a special review of those for themetallurgical industry, public utility undertakings and railways.In the- e cases the price will be related to the price which wouldhave applied to comparable inland business immediately preceding the outbreak of war.Coke     Sanction has been given to theprice of coke being raised to the general inland price level.This follows the increase agreed on the same basis for coal,&quot;exports,Permission is still being granted freely for the export ofcoal, but difficulties in obtaining ships prevent full advantagebeing taken of the present supplies position in this country.Bad weather during the past week has also had the effect of restricting shipments.
