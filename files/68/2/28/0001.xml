In this Report &quot;Colonies&quot; is used to* *&quot;    &quot;     cover not only Colonies in the strictsense, but also Protectorates and mandated Territoriesj    and &quot;colonial governors&quot; is used to include high commissioners and the British ResidentZanzibar.PART 1.GENERAL.1 *     ILtiyj^ a t^i on of Maju-Power.Secretary of State&apos;s Prom, the Colonial point of view, muchCircular TelegramSo. 98 Confidential political importance attaches to the decision ofof 18th October,1939.His Majesty&apos;s Government that during the presentemergence?- British subjects from the Colonies andBritish protected persons who are in this country,including those who are not of pure Europeandescent, are placed for voluntary entry into the armed forces on the same footing as Britishsubjects from the United Kingdom.      This removesa &quot;colour bar&quot; which has been a cause of offenceand complaint in some colonies.      As regardsforces to be raised in the colonies themselves,I am preparing a separate report, for earlycirculation

In a number of territories Custodians of Enemy Property havealready been appointed.        Colonial governments have been ashed to furnish particulars of allimmovable enemy property which has been vested in the Custodians and to refrain from causingsuch property to be sold without prior referenceto the Secretary of  tut 3.4.      Economic measures.The economic measures indicatee in theprevious Report have been followed up o.&apos;s\ expanded.Generally the control is being made morewatertight.

watertight, and the system is functioning smoothly.Defence Finance Regp.lat.ions are now fully in force in the majority of Colonies.      As aresult of representations from the United states ambassador, instructions are being Issued to exempt all non-British subjects resident in theColonies from the scope of the Regulation requiring the registration of securities,      A similarexemption is granted to non-British subjects inrespect of foreign balances which they held priorto the date of the coming into force of the regulation requiring the surrender of such balances.In the last Report reference was made tothe condition of the grant of an export licence tocertain destinations that the goods exported shouldbe sold in the currency of the countries to whichthey were exported,      Difficulties have arisen inthe enforcement of this condition owing to theamount of Colonial trade which is conducted on asterling basis.      The question of devising means tosecure the foreign exchange without dislocating theexisting machinery of trade is now under bons:Idera&apos;tioh.I have referred in my earlier reports tothe arrangements which have been completed forthe purchase of British and French requirementsof certain essential commodities from the colonies.Owing to an improvement in the situation herearrangements have been made, after consultationwith   the   Ministry   of   Food,  to relaxthe

Ingothe peypairemeni that all Colonial oil seeds and vegetable oils should be exported, exclusively tothis country.      Approval has now been obtained inprinciple for the purchase by His majesty&apos;s government,  through the Ministry of food,  of the\diole 1909/40 crop of cocoa from the Gold coast and Nigeria and of a proportion of the crop from certain other Colonies,  at agreed prices.Arrangements for instituting control are in activepreparation.      Plans are also rearing completionfor the purchase at an agreed price of the annualsisal requirements of the United Kingdom and Prancefrom East Africa.      Arrangements for facilitating the marketing of a number of other Colonialproducts are still under consideration.There have been signs from various partsof the Colonial Empire that the practice of buyingUp the whole 07? a large proportion &quot;of the exportable surplus of Colonial crops at a price fixed only alittle above the pre-war price, though for anumber of reasons it is of great benefit to theColonies concerned, as well as to the UnitedKingdom, may lead to difficulties if effectivesteps cannot be taken to check rises in the pricesof imported, goods consumed by the producers ofthose crops.      In such an event the producers, and still more the labour which they employ, are caughtbetween fixed returns and rising costsa      Up to thepresent serious trouble has not arisen from thiscause.

ionI U 5cause.     The immediate effect of the war was tobring about a slight rise (say 10 to 15$) in theprices of the most important Colonial products,and prompt action v/as taken in most Colonies tocontrol the prices of the principal requirementsof the people.      But prices of many imports will almost inevitably rise further, and the whole position requires very careful watching.Apart from assisting in making arrangementsfor the purchase of Colonial food products to meetthe needs of this country,  the Colonial Office hasalso been concerned with maintaining the suppliesof foods which the Colonies draw from this country.Such supplies are in many cases essential to theColonies concerned.      Essential monthly requirements are now being- agreed upon for the various Colonieshaving regard on the one hand to the needs of thoseColonies and on the other to the available supplies in this country.      When these requirements havebeen fixed, it is hoped to ensure that theColonies can continue to receive supplies up to atleast those amounts.The Colonial Office is co-operating withthe Ministry of Shinning with a view to seeing that,  as far as possible, adequate tonnage is madeavailable at reasonable rates for the carriage of colonial goods.Maritime Colonies with bunkering interests have been warned that it ma2-r be necessary to institute at short notice control of bunkers as wellas

This coursecovered the whole field of labour administrationwith special reference to health conditions,nutrition, contracts of employment,  recruitment,minimum wage machinery, industrial relations and workmen&apos;s compensation.      The course was attended by over 40 officers of the Colonial Service andlasted for a fortnight.      It is of even greater importance in war than in peace that ColonialAdministrations should have personnel qualified tohelp in the adjustment of labour conditions and to handle tactfully and effectively labour disputesor troubles which may arise.G.      P inane ei5-S.i:nce  the outbreak of war I have been in communication with all Colonial Governors regardingthe wartime financial policy to be adopted in theColonies.      While the effects of the war on colonial budgets cannot yet be clearIj scon,  I have urged,  amongst other things, the necessity ofsecuring additional revenue by Increasing taxation.

I have in this connexion reminded them of the exceptionally heavy &quot;burden which the taxpayer ofthe United Kingdom is now called upon to bear.The specific revenue proposals of the variousColonial Governments are now receiving consideration in the Colonial Office and I will not refer to themin detail until I can present a comprehensivereport.PART 2.
