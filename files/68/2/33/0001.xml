 ) o n&amp; i-j Q5o A representative of the Norwegian Foreign office has had conversations with His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Oslo,from which it appears that the Norwegians&apos; views of therights which they possess as neutrals are much at variance with those of His Majesty&apos;s Government,      It is therefore proposed that no representative should he sent to Norwaybut that the Norwegians should he invited to send a smallMission here as soon as the shipping question is nearersettlement 0DENMARK.60 A representative of the Danish Government has arrived in London and a satisfactory preliminary discussion on a War Trade Agreement has taken place.

0 9&quot; oK/ 0question will be further studied in collaboration with theother Departments concernedo1h. The Yugoslav Minister has made a communication tothe Foreign Office justifying the intention of the yugoslav government to establish control over minerals produced in yugoslavia,    The Yugoslav Government, who are compelled topurchase armaments abroad and are seeking to do so bybarter arrangements with Germany, consider that in presentcircumstances they should not be denied the right to dispose of Yugoslav products up to the usual limit of export.The Yugoslav Government think, however, that it should bepossible to reach an agreement on this question and on that ofthe exchange agreement with the Trepca Mines Company.      this communication is being considered.BULGARIA.15c The purchase of sunflower seeds in Bulgariareferred to in the last weekly report looks like fallingthrough over the question of pricet    His Majesty&apos;s Ministerat Sofia reports that the Germany are buying at the equivalent of 220 shillings per ton whereas Messrse Dreyfusare offering 135 shillings per ton f,o,b0 Black Sea port.HUNGARY.16, It is hoped shortly to begin informal conversations with the Hungarians with a view to exploring the possibilitiesof a War Trade Arrangement.

for in the agreement signed on October 27th (paragraph 23of last report) has been provisionally constituted.Satisfactory progress on general lines has been made atthe preliminary meetings.    Conversations are also pro-ceeding with a view to the conclusion of a new Anglo-Italian Clearing Agreement.    It is hoped to reach an understanding with the chief Italian importers of petroleum products with the object of guarding against the re-export to Germany of imported supplies, and the important Aquilarefinery have satisfied the Acting British Chairman thatthey have ceased to supply their products to the enemy.18. Representative Italian shipping interests and merchants have been sounded regarding their attitude towardsthe possible application of the Navicert system to cargoesdestined for Italy.     Their response has been so favourablethat it has been necessary to discourage exaggerated ideas of the undoubted advantages which will accrue to them ifthe system is introduced.19. Some further progress has been made with the buyingarrangements mentioned in paragraph 2h of the last report,but fears that the prospects of securing Italian hemp mightbe impaired by delay on our own side have been partiallyborne out.     Germany is reported to have secured promises of over hO,000 tons, and the Italians state this leavesonly 6,000 tons for His Majesty&apos;s Government.    There is,however, still hope of some adjustment.20. The Italian Government continue to be sensitiveregarding the treatment of Italian ships under our contraband control arrangements, which is in fact as lenientas possible, but on the whole the situation has been somewhateasier during the past week.PORTUGAL.21.
