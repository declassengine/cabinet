During October, 13 new ships of various types, from Destroyers downwards,  have been laid down, including 2 Destroyers, 3 Submarines , 1 Escort Vesseland 4 Patrol Vessels:    2 Destroyers and 1 Submarine have been launched:  and six ships,  including 2 Destroyers and 2 Submarineshave completed.It has now been decided in order to save Dollars not to order the 50 Whalecatchers from the United States; but only 10 ihCanada and the necessary arrangements are proceeding.As a result of efforts to expedite the work onthe two Battleships of the 1936 programme,  it is hoped tobring each of them forward three months, the anticipated dates of availability for service now being -KING GEORGE V.    Mid.  September,1940.PRINCE OP WALES.December, 1940.Every endeavour will be made to get the ships completed andtrials finished at the latest by these dates,  even if this involves retarding other work.^the/_s Sundry small craft and two battleships of the 1938 programme on which work has been suspended for one year are not included in these figures.

The possibility of advancing the date of completionof the Aircraft Carrier ILLUSTRIOUS from May,1940 to the endof March,1940,  is also being examined.Work in the Royal Dockyards is proceeding in accordancewith the priority given to specific ships by the Board. under present conditions there are, at any one time,  approximately100 ships, not including Trawlers and small craft generally,under refit or repair. The resources of private yards arebeing used to supplement the Royal Dockyards,  and there are atthe moment 17 ships in hand for repairs with such firms.  Owingto pressure of work on ships of high priority,  some long datedships have necessarily been delayed,  for example, QUEEN ELIZABETHand SIRIUS.  The ultimate delay in these ships will depend onthe amount of higher priority work which the Dockyards are called upon to carry out. The battleship VALIANT which has been largely rebuilt,  is expected to complete on 25th November, 1939.The supply of machinery and electrical equipment forH.M.Dockyards and Shore Establishments is proceeding generallyaccording to Requirements. The position in regard to machine tools is stated in   Section III of this report.Rosyth Dockyard    is being brought forward. Dockingsof the RODNEY and REPULSE, submarines etc.  have already beencarried out there,  in addition to numerous minor repairs to ships of the Fleet.Singapore,  as regards the Dockyard,  is practicallycomplete and is undertaking refits of most classes of ship.AUXILIARY WAR VESSELS AND R.F.A&apos;s.The number of ships requisitioned had increased to1240 by the end of October.  Included in this total are 50 armed merchant Cruisers, 356 travailleur/trawlers (mainly for Minesweeping and anti-Submarine Services), and 88 Oilers.The/

The work of fitting these out is being pressed forward and the main features are:-(l) A.M.C\ s   By the end of October,  17 had completed (13 withemergency and 4 with semi-complete fitting) and a further11 (2 Emergency and 9 semi-complete fitting) will completeearly in November.(2) Minesweepers   As distinct from the Pirst 100 M/S Trawlersfitted with emergency equipment in the first few days of thewar,  54 Trawlers and 3 Paddle Boats have been completed anda further 66 Trawlers and 28 Paddle Boats are in hand.(3) Anti-Submarine Service    33 Trawlers and 26 Yachts have beencompleted for Anti-Submarine service, while a further 55Trawlers and 6 Yachts are in hand. These are in addition tothe Trawlers purchased for A/S duties,  of which 59 have completed fitting.D.E.M.S.The arming of Merchant Ships is proceeding satisfactorilyexcept in certain areas, notably the Number, where progressremains slower than was hoped awing to the need to give priority to more urgent Admiralty work. Nevertheless 708 ships have beenarmed,  430 with one gun,  276 v/ith two guns and 2 ships with 3guns. Of these ships, 70 have been fitted with paravanes.DOCKING POSITION.Southampton Floating Dock   which is being refitted andstiffened at Southampton by contract,  will probably be moved taPortsmouth in December, when the dredging of its berth isexpected to be completed.Sabang Floating Dock   is expected to leave Sabang,  inthe Dutch East Indies,  for Singapore on November 10th,  in tow ofa Dutch tug.    It will provide docking facilities at SingaporeNaval Base for Destroyers and Submarines which at present canonly be docked in the existing Floating Dock or Graving Dock,both of v/hich are of a size to accommodate the largest warships.New Floating Dock building at Swan Hunters,  will probablybe completed in July,1940.Floating Dock at Alexandria formerly Admiralty floating dock No.5 at Portsmouth, which was towed to Alexandria in the summer of this year and moored in a temporary berth inthe/

the first instance,  is now finally moored in position and in use for docking capital ships.The Gladstone Dock, Liverpool and King George VDock, Southampton ,  are Loth now ready for docking capital ships.DAMAGE FROM ENEMY ACTION.So far the amount of dockyard work arising from damage to H.M.Ships from enemy action is net substantial. IRON DUKE,EDINBURGH, SOUTHAMPTON and MOHAWK have sustained damage duringair raids and KITTIWAKE by a mine. Temporary repairs were affected in a few days on EDINBURGH and SOUTHAMPTON and MOHAWKis expected to complete by mid-December. IRON DUKE is beached,however, and it will be many months before she can be recondition-ed as a seagoing ship, and KITTIWAKE will probably be out ofaction for the best part of a year.RESCUE AND SALVAGE WORK. ,(a) Rescue Tug Service.The organisation for providing Rescue Tugs to assist disabledships is being vigorously developed. Nine rescue tugs have beenrequisitioned, of which two have been armed and commissioned. Fourmore are in hand and v/ill complete during November. Eight tugsare building, of which four v/ill be employed on rescue duties and four v/ill release SAINT class tugs from the Dockyards for employment on those duties.Other steps are also being taken and it is anticipated that bythe end of the first twelve months,  some tv/enty rescue tugsv/ill be available,  this being the minimum considered necessaryto meet likely requirements.Locally operative schemes, under v/hich tug owners pooltheir resources to keep a duty tug available,  are now in force at Cardiff, London, Humber, Tyne and Belfast. These services are,however, limited by weather conditions.assistance  stance/

w :-: 0Assistance has heen called for on fifteen occasionssince September 12th and successfully rendered on five occasions.The question of closer co-operation with the French naval authorities in the provision of rescue tugs is being pursued.(&quot;D) Salvage Service.In order that this Service shall be capable of undertakingSalvage work on all H.M.Ships and Merchant ships requiring such assistance in consequence of war damage, and of dealing withthe situation that might arise in ports subjected to aerial bombardment, energetic steps are being taken to supplementconsiderably the Salvage plant and ships at present available.The salvage organisation is being based on five existing firmsdistributed round the coast in order to utilise their existingmanagement and expert staffs, with their special local knowledge,and to ensure that there will be no difficulty or delay inprosecuting vital work which may be unremunerative,  e.g.  removalof wrecks from channels.II.EQUIPMENT AND WARLIKE STORESGUN MOUNTINGS.It is most important that there should be no further lossof skilled workpeople from the industry:  this is dealt within Section IV of this Report. The gun mountings are still a limitation factor. The hampering effect of A.R.P. has been somewhat diminished as a result of better arrangements for continuing full output during black-out hours and relaxationby Local Authorities of their more exacting requirements.NEW WEAPONS.Among new weapons,  every endeavour is being made to expedite the delivery of 2 0 mm.  oerlikon equipments andassociated ammunition now on order from Switzerland;  and rights/

rights to manufacture this weapon and its ammunition inEngland have been purchased. A twin gun equipment for0.5&quot; machine guns will he in production by about April,1940.Improved apparatus for the control of long range and closedefence A.A.weapons is now passing into production and supply to the Fleet will commence early in 1940.PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL ARMAMENT CAPACITY.Action is being taken to increase capacity for opticalglass, and provision of further capacity for the followingservices is under consideration:-(l) Equipment for Merchant Vessels and Auxiliaries.(2) A. A. Ammunition (to meet an expected rise in &quot;therate of expenditure over that so far envisaged).(3) Hardened Shell of medium calibre.GUNS AND AMMUNITION ETC.The value of all orders placed for Naval ArmamentStores from the commencement of the war to the 31st October,is approximately  17-g- millions towards the total of  &amp;8^millions estimated as the cost of the first year&apos;s requirementsThe latter figure includes about  14 millions outstanding onorders placed prior to the outbreak of war.A list of Naval Armament stores has been given to theMinistry of Supply with a view to orders being placed inCanada or the U.S.A. unless they can be met from otheravailable sources.ANTI-SUBMARINE EQUIPMENT.A depot has been established at Portsmouth for themanufacture of Actaeon nets for the anti-torpedo defence ofships, and arrangements are being made for production of 15 netdefences per week in anticipation of successful trials.Deliveries of Paravane gear are adequate to meet theprobable rate at which ships can be fitted. The output ofParavanes is at present 20 per week and will rise to 50 per weeby the end of this year.  The number still to be delivered tocover the needs of the first 2,000 ships is about 2,500.There/

rThere are 1,000 sets of towing gear available and a further,250 on order.ASDICS.A very considerable increase in the weekly rate ofproduction of Asdic sets to meet war requirements has beenapproved.      The successful operation of this programme will,however, be dependent on the availability of labour and on thesupply of raw materials.BOOM DEFENCE GEAR.The recent disaster to HAM. S.  ROYAL OAK has  emphasised the necessity for generally speeding up the provision ofadditional boom defences.      All possible steps are now beingtaken to hasten the delivery of equipment from the  contractors and its assembly.ANTI-MAGNETIC MINE DEVICES.There is evidence of the use by the enemy of magnetic mines,   and work on counter measures is proceeding with intensity.In addition to special vessels under conversion,  2 slow magneticsweeps,  towed by drifters,   are in operation.      Ten sets are beingmade in Vernon and 40 more are on order.      Trials are commencingwith a fast magnetic sweep for towing by   destroyers.FLEET  AIR ARM AIRCRaFI .Arrangements are being made to increase production of aircraft of Torpedo Spotter Reconnaissance type ( ALBaGORE)   andAmphibian type  (WALRUS) to meet anticipated v/ar wastage.The number of Aircraft in First Line Squadrons on1st November was 220 and the number employed on Training and ancillary Services was 189.      These figures compare with 203and 191 respectively on 1st October.      Reserves of ServiceableAircraft have increased from 260 to 353 during the month,  whileunserviceable Aircraft  (in various states of unreadiness)&apos;&apos;1&apos;have decreased from 379 to 364._FLEET/___These figures include    (1)  Aircraft undergoing or due for repairs and overhaul;     (11)Aircraft for which full operationalequipment,   eg.  guns,  is not  available;     (111)airframes withoutengines.

FLEET AIR ARM STOKES AND SPARES.The deficiencies here still cause anxiety.      Thetransfer of stocks from the R.A.P.  consequent upon thecontrol of the P. A. A.  hy the Admiralty is not yet complete,while there is difficulty in obtaining deliveres of articlesordered subsequently.      All possible steps  are being taken inconjunction with the Air Ministry.III.MATERIAL.The supply of raw materials and semi-manufacturedgoods has so far been reasonably satisfactory, with theexception of Machine Tools,   Steel Porgings,  Aluminium,Flax and Timber.      Appropriate action is being taken inthese cases through the established machinery.IV.LABOUR.When the war started many of the contractorsemployed on Admiralty work were already suffering from ashortage of skilled men, despite the special steps takenin the preceding two or three years to obtain and trainapprentices,  and for some considerable time previously ithad been appreciated that difficulty was likely to arisefollowing the withdrawals of skilled men for the Services.The experience of the first two months of war has, however,made it possible to appreciate much more clearly the full extent of the problem to he coped with.The date of completion of ships is primarily dependentupon the availability of certain highly specialised forms of equipment, mainly gun mountings including guns and sights,fire/

fire control gear and searchlight control gear,  especially the electrical equipment thereof.      Acute difficulties are atpresent being experienced by the Admiralty contractorsengaged upon the manufacture of these essential items of equipment owing to a shortage of the requisite skilled labour,(difficulties which   extend also to many other manufacturers of equipment and stores of other sorts required for theAdmiralty).&quot;Exemptions&quot; have been obtained for approximatelythree-quarters of the Army Reservists employed in key positionswith Admiralty contractors,  but these in practice only give aperiod of grace of from one to three months before the men are called in,  so that they do not materially help the situation.80 men originally granted one monthds exemption have now gone.Of 550 men granted two months extension the War Office hasbeen asked,  so far without result, to grant a further extensionin 334 cases, but it is understood that in no instance will theWar Office agree to an &quot;exemption&quot; exceeding three months.There appears little prospect of replacing these men at the endof the three months.A comb-out of skilled men called up for theTerritorials has been proceeding,  but the numbers of men released to return to their civil employment have been disappointing.      It is estimated that some 3,000 skilled men have been called away from their work with Admiraltycontractors.      In the case of 378 firms from whom returns areavailable only 421 men have been released out of about 900who prima facie were due to be combed out.      Approval has nowbeen given by the War Cabinet for the permanent release of afurther number of skilled men to be shared between theServices and this will provide a measure of relief.As /

fj .i-As regards the recruitment of men under the NationalService  (Armed Forces)  Act:    proposals were made to the WarOffice for exemption or general postponement of calling up forthe skilled and semi-skilled men in the employment of alimited number of firms carrying out important Admiralty work.These proposals were unacceptable to the War Office.Another method of securing a substantial measure of postponement of calling up for all skilled and semi-skilled men employed on vital Admiralty work has been discussed bythe Man-bwer Priority Committee;,  accepted as practicable bythe Admiralty and out into operation.With regard to Apprentices it appears that they willbe reserved according to their occupations,  if they havereached the age of reservation, but if below this age, theywill be accepted for the Services only in their trade capacity.If they are not required in that  capacity,  they will not beaccepted.      It is difficult to estimate the effect of this onthe position of Admiralty contractors and the matter willrequire further consideration,      It must be appreciated thatif the skilled men withdrawn for service with the Armed Forcesdo not return,  there is bound to be an adverse effect on theproduction of the essential  items of equipment mentioned above.Further withdrawals will accentuate this and may make itimpossible to adhere to the completion dates of ships due in1940.      Dilution will help but there has not yet been timeto feel the benefit of this.

-11-&quot; M r.iV.&quot;vTjRKS .The various major works services have been reviewed and it has teen decided to cancel or suspend work on somethat cannot complete before the end of 1940 in pursuance ofthe policy of conserving our immediate resources for projectsthat can bear fruit most quickly.      Some other worksprojected or in an early stage are at present being examinedfrom the point of view of whether they should be reduced ordeferred.      On the other hand steps are being taken to bring forward Dean Hill Armament Depot so as to complete by December,1940,  an advance of one year;    and proposals are underconsideration to accelerate work on   Underground Oil fuelDepots so as to provide some 450,000 tons of new storage by december,  1940.      After which all projects have been temporarily suspended.The slowing down of work as previously experienced byreason of non-availability of labour,  material and transport is being overcome to some extent by letters to contractors or sub-contractors, which can be shewn to suppliers or controllersof materials, testifying that work is Government work and urgent,by changes in form of construction and by action with the ministries of Transport and Supply,  Employment Exchanges,  etc.The difficulties arising through A. R. P.  requirements have been somewhat eased;    for example, night work has been permitted at one of the P. A.A.  Stations and on protectivemeasures at Oil Fuel Depots,  at the discretion of local commanders in Chief.

9 r.&quot; 3K( t* (J-12-VI.SUPPLIES TO OTHER COUNTRIES.Arrangements have been made up to date mainly throughthe medium of the Allied Demands Committee,  to meet therequirements of allied and neutral countries for ships andwarlike stores to the value of approximately  2,000,000.In addition ammunition amounting in value to about  250,000which had been consigned to Poland, has been diverted and isnow on offer to Turkey.The French Government is also ordering 4 Patrol vessels and 18 Motor   Torpedo Boats from commercial firms in theUnited Kingdom.
