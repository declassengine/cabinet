rHjgjOCUMjT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)P.(R) (59) 53 COPY NO.    -/ ^war    cabinet civil DEFENCE REPORT No.   6Sixth Report submitted by the Ministerof Home Security covering the period from midnight 15th October to midnight 29th October, 1959(Previous Report: Paper No.W.P.(R) (39) 53)Enemy Air Attack1. The presence of raiders,  either singly or in small groups,or of unidentified aircraft, gave rise to air raid warningsalong the east coast areas of England and Scotland on the 17th,18th, 20th,  23rd and 28th October.        Excepting two ineffectivebombs in the Orkneys, no bombs have been dropped on land.Air Raid Precautions services . A circular letter was issued to local authorities on the20th October instructing them to submit to the regional commissioner proposals for the manning of their air raidprecautions services in the light of general directions set outin the circular letter.      It is anticipated that the effect willbe a reduction in the numbers standing by in most services in less vulnerable areas;    but in many areas and for particular services some further recruitment may be necessary to maintain an adequate margin of safety.lighting Restrictions3. The question whether any form of street lighting can be permitted is being kept under review, and further tests are proposed.4* A deputation was received by the Minister of home security on Friday,  27th October,  from the National

Confederation of Employers Organisations and Trade Union Congress0n the subject of lighting restrictions.      The only concretesuggestion put forward was that the blackout should commencehalf an hour after sunset and cease half an hour before sunriseinstead of operating as at present from sunset to sunrise.5, Following discussions with the railway companies, thework of installing reasonable lighting for reading in main linetrains and of improving suburban train lighting is now in hand.Air Raid Warnings6. Endeavours have been made to restrict the amount of overtaction taken in Government Departments and elsewhere on receiptof the preliminary caution.      Negotiations are in progress withthe London Passenger Transport Board to limit the action taken at tube railway stations and elsewhere on receipt of thepreliminary caution.      Discussions are taking place with theAdmiralty about the practice of sounding sirens in certaindockyards on receipt of the preliminary caution which results inalarm being caused in neighbouring towns where the action warninghas not yet been received.Camouflage7. The oil tanks at Avonmouth have been successfullycamouflaged and the method adopted is to be applied to similarinstallations.      Brooklands Race Track, which is importantbecause of its proximity to the Vickers Factory, is to bedisguised to conceal its distinctive shape.8. Factories are proceeding with camouflage schemes and satisfactory progress has been made in the cases of those factoriesclassified as vital points.Supplies(a) Children&apos;s Respirators and Babies Protective Helmets9* Investigation is being made into the possibility of

introducing fresh productive capacity-      There has been a 15%increase in deliveries of the facepiece (the key component) ofthe children&apos;s respirator,(b) Steel Shelters10,       A public announcement has been made that steel sheltersmay now be purchased.      The scheme provides for cash payment( 8 for the standard unit),  or for hire purchase ( 1.10.0deposit and 10 monthly instalments of 15/- making a total of 9).       Distribution is at present restricted to a number of towns with over 100,000 inhabitants, but including all theMetropolitan Boroughs.      The areas selected include those wherefree distribution is most advanced.11. The total production of steel shelters to date is about1,500,000 and production is continuing at 50,000 a week.      Thenumber available for sale each week is 5,000.Emergency Fire Brigade Measures12. The total number of air raid fire precautions schemes0 received from borough and urban district councils has now reached335.       Only 30 schemes from small places are outstanding.13.     About 800 returns have been received from borough and urban district councils in response to the circular letter of the29th September dealing with the review of the whole time paidAuxiliary Fire Service personnel.      Action has already been takenin about 400 cases.Deliveries of equipment are proceeding satisfactorily,^ualty services on Sunday October 29th the number of vacant beds inwigland and Wales was approximately 170,000,  showing a decrease0i 5,000 during the past fortnight.      A substantial proportionI y&apos; tile 5,000 &quot;lost&quot; beds are accounted for by Service sick.

-4-26. As it appeared that hospitals at large did not understandthat they were expected to admit anybody requiring in-patient treatment,  the Ministry of Health has sent a letter to all the&quot;reduced&quot; hospitals in London emphasizing this and indicating that some overflow into &quot;casualty beds&quot; may be permitted.During the last week a letter v/as also sent to approximately 700hospitals and institutions,  including between them approximately20,000 empty beds,  informing them that beds need no longer be keptempty.17. In Scotland, the number of beds available for casualtiesat the end of the period v/as approximately 12,450 or an increaseof 50 beds over the fortnight.18. Payment to hospital authorities for the fourth fortnighthas begun.      Approximately  450,000 has been paid out to voluntary hospitals up to date.      It has not yet been possible to startregular payments to every voluntary hospital v/here beds have been cleared, because of the difficulty of obtaining a reliable figureof cost per bed in some cases.        The Hospital Accountants are endeavouring to secure these figures by visits to the hospitals and examination of accounts.19. Pour reports have been received from the Accountants onhospitals in the Scheme which may become bankrupt, and these cases are under consideration^. vacuati on20. The further evacuation of school children in England andWales, whose parents registered them under the supplementary scheme, is being carried out as arrangements can bo made forbinding homes for them and for reuniting them with their schoolunits.      Children who have been registered have been medicallyinspected.      Experience so far has shown that many of those who

-5-have been registered (in some districts more than 50 per cent.)do not attend when the day for evacuation comes.21.       In accordance with the directions of the Civil DefenceCommittee on 24th October, 1959,  (C.D.C.(59) 7th Meetingconclusion 3) plans are being worked out for a further evacuation of certain of the priority groups in the event of air raids.22. When the Forth was raided on the 16th October,  theDepartment of Health for Scotland had under considerationrepresentations in favour of extending the evacuation areas inthe Rosyth districts      On 20th October it was decided to addSouth Queensferry, North Quoensferry and Inverkeithing to the list of sending areas, a decision to which full publicity wasgiven.      Children in the throe areas were registered for evacuation on the 25rd and 24th October;    in all 211 were registered.      Medical inspection was completed the same week,  andevacuation planned to begin on 30th October.23. A further 950 children were evacuated from the originalScottish sending areas during the fortnight under the supplementary evacuation scheme.      4,800 of the 11,100registered have now gone.24. In accordance with a decision of Civil Defence Committeeon the 10th October,  1959,  (C.D.C.(59) 5th Meeting,  conclusion (e)), plans are being worked out,  in collaboration with theRailway Companies, for periodical cheap fares which will enablevisits to be made to reception areas by parents and husbands onspecified Sundays.25. The return which is being obtained from reception^   authorities of those who have gone back to evacuation areas isnot yet complete, but the figures so far available show thatthis movement has been much more pronounced in the case of

-others and young children than in the case of school childrenoThe returns obtained cover areas in which 335,680 mothersand young children were billeted;    out of these 153,503 or 45,8%have returned.,      In the same areas the number of school children who were billeted was 475,76.1;    out of these 56,556 or 7.7&apos;/o havejoturnodug :m.gqls2&apos;,&apos;.       On October 27th the Home Policy Committee approved,  inprinciple, proposals of the Board of Education for the reopeningin evacuation areas of schools for such numbers of children asjould he protected without recourse to expensive structuralalterations,  -additions to buildings,  and the like,bicrgenoy Relief in Kind to Rcfugoos from Air Attacks 3. The Civil Defence Committee had under consideration on the24th October (CoDnCa(39) 7th Meeting concision 2) a report by theSinister of Health and Secretary of State for Scotland on therrangomcrits made for emergency relief in kind to refugees fromsir attackso      The Committee invited the Ministers concerned tosubmit a further report in a monthPs time and recommended that theattention of the War Cabinet should be drawn to the arrangements-rich had been made      In accordance with the Committee&apos;s&quot;ccommendat:; on,  a short memorandum by the Ministry of Health-hiirung the arrangements is appended to this Report,^.ehh XLrdcrPublic order and morale continue to be very good and thereno particular evidence of dissatisfaction with war conditions,l-cept that in several places objection has been raised to theiteration of shop hours.The morale of the population in areas which have received^inge has been good.      He panic has been reported and on

occasions when air combat has been observed, by civilianstheir attitude appears to have been one of curiosity.31.       While it would appear that the Peace Pledge Union,Communists, Fascists and certain sections of the Welsh Churchare indulging in anti-war propaganda the total effect of theiractivity does not appear groat.Railways32.       The improvement of long distance passenger services,together with the re-introduction of a limited service ofrestaurant cars and improved sleeping car facilities, has donemuch to meet the criticisms of these services.33.        The burden on the wagon capacity of the railways is increasing.      At some collieries work has had to be curtailedor temporarily suspended owing to the fact that wagons are notavailable.        The Minister of Transport, with the President ofthe Board of Trade,  is to meet representatives of trade andindustry to urge upon thorn the need for securing a quickerrelease of wagons at terminal points.34.        The RaiIway Companies are introducing a scheme by whichgoods train traffic forwarded by one Company for delivery by another shall be accepted only on certain days of the week.The scheme, which will apply only to ordinary goods not formingcomplete wagon loads, is designed to obtain a better loadingof wagons and to give a better service to traders.Docks and Harbours35.       The positior p-enorally continues to be satisfactory.36.        On advice received through the Admiralty there was apractically complete diversion of shipping from East coast ports to tho West between 13th to 23rd October.      This resultedin the rapid filling up of West Coast ports, but seriouscongestion had not been experienced when circumstances

justified a relaxation in the degree of diversion.      the extensive diversions during this period caused muchinconvenience and expense to consignees (including GovernmentDepartments) and delay in the arrival of diverted cargoes totheir destinations.37.       Arrangements have teen made with the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare and the Admiralty Marshal to speed up themachinery for reducing the delays in dealing v/ith prize cargoesboth before and after discharge.Road Transport38.        The position in both passenger and goods road transportcontinues to be satisfactory.Alternative Accommodation for Government Staffs39. The number of staffs already moved to premises outside london is 13,845. Moves of a further 5,770 staff are underconsideration. The number of staff moved during the period under review was 3,200.40.       Work on air raid precautions protection for thealternative War Rooms of the War Cabinet,  Service Ministriesand the Ministry of Home Security is practically complete,but authority has not yet been given for the provision ofprotection for other staffs.J.A.Ministry of Home Security,Whitehall.2nd November,  1939.

APPENDIXAIR ATTACKNOTE BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTHAs a result of action &quot;beginning last June and intensifiedsince the outbreak of war,  every public assistance authority inEngland and Wales (i.e.  every county and county borough council)has given consideration to making emergency schemes for providing food and shelter both for persons rendered homeless byaerial bombardment and for unorganised refugees, whetherinhabitants of their own area or coming from other areas.The extent of these plans must obviously be governed bythat of the probable need.      The authorities of remote districts in Wales or the South West of England are unlikely to be facedat short notice with a large problem of this kind and there isno need for them to do much more than ensure reserve stocks offood at public assistance institutions.      At the other end of thescale,  the most vulnerable and congested areas like London andthe North East coast have to allow for the possibility thathundreds and even thousands of their inhabitants may besuddenly rendered homeless until they can be found other accommodation,  and that considerable numbers of refugees mayflee for safety into the neighbouring countryside.        between these two extremes lie the majority of authorities whose areasway suffer in whole or part from occasional air raids,  and who may have to cope with some exodus of refugees from neighbouringvulnerable areas.Every authority in the vulnerable areas has taken activesteps towards an adequate scheme, and the plans of the greatMajority are now sufficiently complete to be workable in a suddenemergency.      One authority (Derby County Borough) is still held

up by the difficulty of finding premises not already earmarked for the Army.      In the rest of the country schemes either are complete or are rapidly taking shape.      Every authority which hasnot completed its plans is being actively stimulated to do so bythe Regional staffs of the Ministry of Health.As already indicated, the extent of the schemes rightlyvaries in different parts of the country, but even in the most vulnerable areas they are not designed to do more than providesimple hot food and rough shelter for a very short time by setting aside suitable premises (which are then earmarked by theOffice of Works so that they shall not be requisitioned for anyother purpose),  equipping them with cooking and feeding utensilsand material for a shake-down,  laying in stocks of food at anaccessible distance, arranging for adequate paid and voluntarystaff, and securing co-ordination with the local police.Detailed information of the schemes in each Civil DefenceRegion is now being collected so as to ensure that adequate provision has in fact been made for such eventualities as can before seen.      It is anticipated that even after a heavy raid thegreat majority of homeless persons will be absorbed into other accommodation either by their own efforts or by municipal billetingand it is difficult to see how panic fugitives from their homeswould be able, even if they desired,  to move in large numbers longdistances from their area of residence.Some assistance towards the cost of these arrangements isbeing given by the Government.      The necessary equipment for the feeding station has been directly supplied or will be paid for andv&apos;ill remain Government property0      The Government will meet thecost of the service so far as it  is used by persons from outsidethe Authority&apos;s  area and finally,  if any substantial addition

IT&apos; ^-J   Jis thrown on the rates above the normal level of publicassistance expenditure by the provision of the service for residents,they Will grant financial assistance to meet it.
