i &apos;o DIMTOS-IRIAL RELATIONS.Wages, hours and conditions.I,     Industrial relations are still dominated hy the obvious reluctanceboth of employers and workpeople to create difficulties which might impede the national effort.     Nevertheless, signs have multiplied in all areasin the last fortnight that demands for wage increases to counter-balance the rise in the cost of living may ho generally made.      Already there havebeen certain isolated cases where demands for wage increases have eitherbeen supported or, in certain cases, based solely on the increased costs of household commodities.2.     There is also some evidence of the effect on the lower paid workers ofthe flat rate of  3 per week payable to A.R.P. workers and in these casesthis may he an additional incentive to a campaign for wage increases.3.     Apart from the question of the cost of living and its effect on wagelevels, there are indications of the desire of workpeople on government contracts to share, by means of increased wages, in the large profits which,rightly or wrongly, they think are being made.4.     Wages claims are under consideration in the Railway, Coal-mining, Cotton,Wool Textile, Wholesale Clothing, Jute, Electricity Supply, Scottish building and the Glasgow Dock industries.     Claims affecting certain Iron and Steelworkers and affecting overtime rates and conditions in the shipbuilding industry are also under consideration.5.     An increasing cause of concern is the &quot;black out&quot;, both as it affectstransport workers in particular and as it affects all workers in so far as itlengthens their day by increasing the time spent in travelling.     As regardsthe transport workers, difficulties, which have resulted in some shortstoppages of work, have occurred both in the goods and passenger transportsides of the industry.     Perhaps the difficulties are most marked in passenger transport as, in this case, there are added to the other difficulties connectedwith the black out the increased, crowding on buses as a result of the curtail-Qent of schedules owing to petrol rationing.      There are also some indications of unrest where the blacking out or camouflaging of factories creates discomfortfor workers through bad lighting and inadequate ventilation.

1 4 1H\gL0rdSNT AMD UMEivEPLQ111ENT.Unemployment Figures,g.    As stated in the previous Report, the tyro weekly returns on 18th and25th September showed increases amongst the wholly unemployed (excludingcasuals) of nearly 100,000 and 54,000 respectively.      The corresponding figures for 2nd and 9th October are 29,000 and 17,000.7.     It &quot;/rill he observed, that while unemployment is still increasing the rateof increase is declining and apart from unforeseeable developments, such asenemy action, unemployment should soon reach its maximum.3.     Some of the recent increases in unemployment is due to normal seasonalinfluences, but much of it amongst men results from discharges of workersconsequent on completion of civil defence work, cessation of private building and house decorating, and petrol restrictions involving van drivers,  &apos;busdrivers and conductors, clerical workers and staffs at garages.     alternative work 4should, however, be available for large numbers of drivers, the Array,for example, requiring several thousands from industry immediately.     Asubstantial number of the women recorded as unemployed are probably not normally in the industrial field.9.     The black-cut is causing curtailment of work in shipyards and in cottonmills in Lancashire - because of the large amount of window space in thesemills - but this does not result in total unemployment.8A-*     Notwithstanding the increases in total unemployment, there is evidenceof increased employment in a number of trades as the following notes show.Engineering, Aircraft and Vehicles, and Shipbuilding Industries.10.     Since the outbreak of war the number of unemployed in these industriesahas continued to fall week by week, and it would appear that employers arenow prepared to accept applicants who in the past would not have been considered&quot;veil enough qualified (either by reason of advanced age or protracted unemploy-ment) for re-engagement in their trade.      It is understood that in mostdistricts in which the Engineering industry is carried on, meetings of theLocal Joint Committees which have been set up in connection with the Relaxation(i.e. Dilution) i-greement, have been held, and that in some cases discussionsape proceeding regarding the reorganisation of production at individual firms0 Permit of the engagement of additional semi-skillea    id unskilled workpeople.

111-a. JJ. the shortage cf shipwrights and other shipbuilding workers continues,and there are indications that Admiralty work on the conversion of trawlers and the refitting of ships is being held up as the result.Manufacture of Metals.12.     The number of unemployed workpeople registered in these occupationscontinues to fall;    this trend has been in evidence for some months past, andthere are no indications of dislocation having been caused in these industries by the outbreak of war.Port Transport.13-     There has been no marked change in the demand for dock labour since thelast report.     Slackness in London continues mid there is little likelihood ofany improvement in the near future.     On the contrary, uncertainties arisingfrom the diversion of shipping are bound to have increasing effect.     certain of the East Coast ports, i.e. Hull, Middlesbrough and Tyne and Y/ear show some slight improvement.      In the West Coast ports the general position remains morefavourable.ih Since the last report an agreement has been formally concluded betweenthe Minister, Employers and the Unions, providing for the temporary transferof dock labour to ports where additional labour may be required owing to the diversion of shipping. The scheme is to be operated through the National joint council for Dock Labour in co-operation with the Ministry and the local PortLabour Joint Committees, and volunteers are being recruited by the Unions inthe ports.     The scheme may be briefly summarised as follows:-(i) When it is decided that additional labour is required, men willfirst be obtained, if possible, from ports within daily travellingdistance.      If this is more than five miles free travel will beprovided.(ii) If it is necessary to bring volunteers from more distant portsarrangements for transfer will be made, provided there is reasonable prospect of at least six days work.     Volunteers so transferred will receive free travel, travelling and subsistence allowances, and aguarantee of at least six days&apos; pay at a minimum of 10/- a day.Road Transport.i5.    Unemployment has increased amongst drivers of heavy commercial vehiclescartel   -fni oo a lesser extent, amongst chauffeurs and bus and taxi drivers.      This

illc0 be anticipated as a result of the Petrol Rationing Scheme which became operative on the 25rd September,, and it is probable that the full effect of this is yet to be felt.Bui3ding.IQ.     While the total increase in unemployment amongst skilled building workers has been relatively small, there has been a considerable turnover inthe personnel of the building industry.     The cessation of most civil building work and the curtailment of local authority housing schemes caused somedislocation and an increase in unemployment, but the majority of the skilled men were rapidly absorbed on Air Raid. Precautions construction work and on theGovernment building programme.      Carpenters and bricklayers remain in greatdemand for this work, but the most receiit figures show an increase in unemploy-ment in both of these occupations.     Between 11th September and 2nd october the numbers of carpenters unemployed increased from 2,666 to 3,350 and thenumbers of bricklayers from 5,553 to 8,483.17.     The Works and Building Priority Sub-Committee is taking steps to obtain from the contracting Departments detailed information of the requirements, bothof materials and labour, for their present and future builcling programme, andit is hoped that this information when collated will provide the basis for effective planning of the works in question in relation to the supply ofmaterials and the availability of labour.Coal Mining.18.     There has been little change in the general position, which remainssatisfactory.     Short-time working continues in some collieries which &apos;previously made substantial deliveries of coal to Germany and Italy but therehas been an improvement recently as other outlets become available.      This istrue both in South Wales and in the Northern Coalfields.     The demand of the steel industry for coking coal has resulted in full-time working at allcollieries producing this grade.Textiles.19. There has been no marked change here since the 18th September. Somefirms report that skilled textile workers are leaving the industry for moreremunerative employment and it appears that in some towns married women arebeing asked to resume their old employment as v/orsted spinners.4.

The Central Register of persons with scientific, technical, professional and higher administrative qualifications now contains about 99,000 names.23.     Orders on the Central Register for 5,120 vacant posts hive been receivedup to the 14-th October, of which 476 were scientific, 2,548 industrial,2,108 professional and 188 administrative.     Up to the same date 3,997 nameshave been submitted to employers.24.     Some orders from private firms continue to be received.TRAINING.25.     Recruiting among the unemployed for training for work in war industriesat Government Training Centres and the subsidiary Centres which are recruitedlocally has proceeded rapidly, and the Centres will thus be able to turn togood account a period of unemployment among a considerable number of menv/hich would otherwise have been wasted.Clothing.20.    There has been a decrease in the nunibcr of wholly unemployed intailoring, dressmaking and millinery, and the manufacture of hats and cops,which probably reflects the development of the change-over of production tov/ar time requirements.      There are two points which may be of interest.      Theabsence of German competition is apparently resulting in renewed activity inthe silk wear industry at Norwich.     At Luton evacuees from Shoreditch arealready being absorbed by the local factories.Fishing.21.     The unemployment position remains serious but there has been a furtherslight improvement in the last two weeks.     The present total of whollyunemployed is roughly 3,000 less than on the 11th September.      The requisitioning of trawlers has hit Hull very hard, while at Lowes toft only 60 boats are cut,representing about 35 per cent, of last year&apos;s fleet,THE CENTRAL REGISTER.

JUVENILES. jf -? aAUTHORISEP COURSES 0? INSTRUCTION.26.     Sines the previous report,  one further Junior Instruction Centre has-opened making a total of 30 now in operation of which 21 are in Wales.JUVENILE- UmgLOYMSNT.27.   Before the war,  juvenile unemployment was very low,  arid so far as itexisted was concentrated mainly in areas in the North and West.      Since theoutbreak of the war there has been seme increase in juvenile- unemployment,though this has not been very heavy,  at least in the case of boys.      At14th August there were 38,347 boys registered as unemployed and at11th September this had increased to 44-, 543.      In the case of the girls,  onthe other hand,  there was an increase in the corresponding period from39,414 to 64,351.     This increase is understood to be largely due to increases in unemployment in luxury trades.28.    Even at the new higher figure,  juvenile unemployment is very small in proportion to the total insured juvenile population&apos;..     The greatest increasein unemployment among juveniles has been in London, where there has been aconsiderable dislocation of industry since the war.      Apart from London,  themain areas of juvenile unemployment remain in the North ard West of thecountry.RECRUITING.29.    Arrangements are now complete for the registration on 21st October ofthose men covered by the first proclamation under the National Service(Armed Forces) Act -who are not already registered under the MilitaryTraining Act.      It is expected that about 250,000 men will register on that day, and detailed instructions on the procedure to be followed at the timeof registration have been issued to all Local Offices of the Ministry.30.    Since the 21st September the medical boards have been working at fullpressure, and it is expected that the remaining classes of militiamen willbe medically examined before the next age group is registered on21st October.     An analysis of the results of the recent medical examinationsindicates that the high standard of physique attained by the first batchesof militiamen is being generally maintained.     The latest returns show thatof 144,628 men examined, 131,878 or 91.2 per cent,    were placed inGrades I and II.     This is only 0.9 per cent, lower than the figure recordedfor the period 8th June to 5th August.    81.4 per cent of the men have beenPlaced in medical category I. 6.

31,   Two of the reconstituted local tribunals, which have been set up fordealing with the applications of men to be registered as conscientious objectors, have started to operate,  and several other local tribunals willcommence to hear cases next week.      Statistics showing the differentcategories into which the men are placed by the tribunals will be availableshortly.32.    The work of the University Joint Recruiting Boards and the attachedTechnical Committees has been proceeding satisfactorily,  and the latest figures show that in all approximately 11,000 interviews have been granted.The function of the Joint Recruiting Boards is to interview undergraduatesand resident graduates, to assess their qualities of leadership,  and tomake recommendations regarding their suitability for training in anofficer-training unit.      The recommendation of a Joint Recruiting Board doesnot guarantee a man a commission, but it dees   .enable him to receive histraining in a unit where he will have an opportunity of displaying the requisite qualities of an officer.      The purpose of the Technical Committeesis to interview men under 25 years of age with special technical qualifica-tions, whether University men or not,  and to make recommendations as to theway in which their specialised knowledge can best be utilised in the national interest.     According to the latest returns,  2,070 men have been interviewedby the Committees since the outbreak of war.Up to the present most of the men who have been granted interviewshave been men with no statutory liability for service in the armed forces.SCHEDULE OF RESERVED OCCUPATIONS.33.   The Schedule of Reserved Occupations has been kept under continualreview and certain amendments have been made to meet current circumstances.Arrangements have also been made to postpone the calling up, in exceptional cases, of individual key men who are not reserved under the Schedule.34.   There has been continued co-operation with the War Office on the comb-out of key men from the Territorial Army,  and with the three service departments in regard to the comb-out of militiamen in occupations for whichthe war time reservation age is 18.

PROVISION FOR THE ^UNEMPLOYED AND FOR BELIEFOP DISTRESS.35. The arrangements for administering unemployment insurance and unemploy-ment assistance continued to work smoothly.35.   The figures given below show for a date in each week from the outbreakof war to the 13th October, the number of cases in which allowances had beenauthorized or were under consideration (a) under the ordinary unemployment assistance Scheme,  and (b) under the war-time scheme for the Prevention and relief of Distress.ILQYMEMTfcludinglementarysfances tomants forploymentranee-fit).8.9.39.438,00015.9.33.405,00022,9,39.395,00029.9.39.394,0006.10.39.397,00013.10.39401,000mm andISF 07ESSEvacuatedpersons40,00045,00034,00023,00018,00014,000hher cases3,00017,00025,00023,00028,00028,00037.   It will be seen that after a considerable fall in the number ofUnemployment Assistance cases at the beginning of the war, which v/ascommented upon in the previous report,  the figure remained more or lessstationary for four weeks.(Intd.)
