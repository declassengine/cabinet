THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (R.) (40) 204.November 16, 1940.WAR CABINET.REPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 1940 FOR INDIA.BURMA AND THE COLONIES, PROTECTORATES AND MAN-DATED TERRITORIES.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.1. Political Situation.OCTOBER has seen the suspension, with the approval of the Cabinet, of theplan for an enlarged Executive Council and the beginning of individual civildisobedience by the Congress under the direction of Mr. Gandhi.At the end of September the Congress, the Muslim League and the&apos;Mahasabha had all, for different and indeed mutually incompatible reasons,declared their unwillingness to serve on the enlarged Executive Council, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government were considering whether or not to proceed with the plan in collaboration with such other political parties or leaders as might be ready toco-operate. It was decided not to proceed, at amr rate for the time being. Mean-while, the Congress had recalled Mr. Gandhi to the direction of its opposition toGovernment, and in an interview with the Viceroy he had proposed that he andhis supporters should be allowed to preach not only pacifism but opposition on political grounds to the present war as the price of abstaining from civil dis-obedience. His suggestions were refused and he made a public statement on the5th October, giving little indication of his real plans. These appear to have been stated to and discussed with the Working Committee of the Congress, whoapproved, though not without opposition to the restricted scale of it notablyfrom Nehru and Kalam Azad. Gandhi&apos;s plans soon took shape in the delivery,under his orders, of speeches to village audiences on the 17th, 18th and 19th ofthe month by one Vinoba Bhave, a learned and philanthropic disciple of theMahatma, not previously known in this country. These, ostensibly to vindicatethe right of free speech, in fact constituted defiance of Government by dissuadingpossible recruits and by influencing the public in a manner prejudicial to the efficient prosecution of the war. They evoked little public enthusiasm, andVinoba&apos;s arrest, apparently expected to take place upon the spot, was not made until his speeches had been examined and found actionable. He was prosecutedunder the Defence Rules, found guilty and sentenced to three months&apos; imprison-ment. It is reported that he is likely to fast. Gandhi, by the end of the month,had not made clear what his next intentions might be. He is said to have available under his orders twenty-four successors to Vinoba. An invitation tobe the &quot;next resister &quot; was accepted by Pundit Jawaharlal Nehru, who, moreor less in defiance of Gandhi&apos;s plans, had been delivering since early in the[21909] B
month in some of the most troublesome parts of the United Provinces speecheswhich were seditious, opposed to the war and provocative of agrarian trouble.With the approval of the Cabinet he was, however, at this stage arrested and isnow being prosecuted. So far these two arrests are all that has occurred in thenew civil disobedience campaign. The Government of India&quot;s plans for dealingwith this campaign are based on continuance for the present of prosecutionsunder the ordinary law, including the Defence Pules, special legislation being held as a weapon in reserve. They have also promulgated an order under theDefence Rules making it illegal to publish in the Press accounts of civildisobedience speeches and activities. Reactions in the country have so far not made themselves apparent. There is no sign of any immediate public enthusiasmsuch as occurred in earlier civil disobedience movements.There has been a new outbreak of civil disobedience in Hyderabad State.Popular sup-port for the war.Numerous gifts of money for the provision of aircraft and other purposeshave been received in all parts of India, and the War Committees instituted bythe Governors have been functioning both in connection with these gifts and inother waj^s. The Civic Guard is growing in numbers and efficiency, particularlyin the larger cities. Resolutions have been passed and speeches made in various parts of India in favour of full support to the war effort. They have come fromall communities and from every province. Characteristic amongst them is aresolution supporting the war effort from the Indian Seamen&apos;s Union, whilespeeches have been made by political leaders in Sind, Bengal, Bihar, Madras andmore particularly in the Punjab. The Sikh community, in particular, has givenstrong evidence of its desire to maintain its position as a recruiting ground forthe army.2. Military Affairs.(i) The Eastern Group Conference opened its meetings at Delhi on the25th October. The countries participating are Australia, New Zealand. SouthAfrica, Southern Rhodesia. Burma, Hong Kong, Ceylon, Malaya, Palestine and territories covered by the East African Governors&apos; Conference in addition toIndia. The Conference will also have the benefit of the advice of Sir AlexanderRoger and the other members of the Ministry of Supply Mission. The Nether-lands East Indies are being represented by three observers.In his opening speech the Viceroy defined the object of the conference as &quot;topool our resources so that we may, as a group of Governments and countries, putforward the greatest material war effort we can.&quot; He added : &quot;I am satisfiedwe have it in our power, working together, to make towards the common cause a contribution which is destined to be of the greatest value, and which may, indeed,prove to be decisive. But if results of the highest value are to flow from ourjoint endeavours it is evident that our contribution must be timely as well assufficient, for in war speed is near to victory.&quot;Under existing arrangements India is already responsible for supplying thebulk of the requirements of 14 Divisions, excluding the needs of the forces in thecountry itself. For the purpose of the discussions of the conference the&apos;&apos; target&apos;&apos; has recently been redefined and the task of the conference is to draw-up plans for meeting from existing and potential sources in the countries repre-sented as much as possible of the needs of forces serving in the Middle East andfurther eastern areas, amounting to 30 Divisions, excluding the Garrison of India.The Conference will also consider the creation of some organisation to maintainliaison between those taking part in it and to supervise the execution of thesupply arrangements agreed upon.(ii) The 5th Indian Division is now complete in the Middle East.India has agreed to send to Aden one 3-7-inch howitzer battery, withmechanical transport, to replace No. 27 Indian Mountain Battery which is beingmoved to Kenya.  The new battery was due to embark at the end of October.The move of a force headquarters and two brigade groups from India to malaya should be completed by the 10th November.India has now been asked to make provision for maintenance and reserves of ! .213,000 men (including the Army in India) and 93,000 animals.
3. Foreign and Frontier Relations.A nihavistan.The failure of air attacks on Great Britain has had a reassuring effect on public opinion and has temporarily discredited German propaganda, whichprophesied an early victory. The internal situation remains satisfactory. Themain preoccupation of the Afghans is with Russia&apos;s attitude and the possibility that the German advance in the Balkans may cause her to seize the opportunityto extend her influence, in Central Asia. The Soviet Ambassador is reported tohave shown a more friendly attitude lately both to the Turkish Ambassador andalso to the British Legation.North- West Frontier.The Faqir of lpi was thwarted in an attempt to settle in Mahsud territory by the Mahsads, who told him that his presence would cause them to be bombed.He is reported now to be back in Shirwal. The general atmosphere inWaziristan has shown signs of improvement, and there has been little hostileactivity, partly owing, no doubt, to the fast. The tribes of the Khyber Agency,after subscribing liberally to the North-West Frontier Fighter Aeroplane Fund,have now expressed their disgust at the air bombing of England and have con-tributed 1,000 rupees to the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund for the relief of sufferers. InMohmand country and elsewhere prayers are being offered for the safety of egypt and other Islamic countries.Bhutan.The Maharaja has written to the Viceroy expressing his friendship and hissympathy with the Allied cause and sending 60,000 rupees from his Governmentfor the War Purposes Fund.Sinkiang.The boycott of the Consulate in Kashgar and of British subjects in Yarkandstill continues. The Kashgar Commissioner on the 20th September denied thatthe boycott was officially inspired and promised help in obtaining supplies. he undertook to caution the authorities in Yarkand and to help British subjectsthere. Since then there has been a slight improvement in Kashgar, but nofurther newrs has been received from Yarkand.French India.After discussions with M. Bonvin, the Governor of the French Establish-ments in India, and with Free French elements in Cairo, arrangements are beingmade to start Free French broadcasts from the Indian transmitting centre atKirkee in the near future. It is hoped that these broadcasts will be valuable,particularly for reception by the French in Syria.Persian Gulf.On the 19th October an attack was made on the Bahrein Oil Refinery by two or three Italian aircraft, which dropped 50 bombs without doing any damage or causing any casualties. A single aircraft also bombed the California ArabianStandard Oil Company&apos;s premises at Dharan in Saudi Arabia, causing slight damage to the water and oil pipe-lines. Apart from some excitement on thepart of the American personnel, particularly on the mainland, there have been no untoward reactions to the raid. The exaggerated claims subsequently madeby the Germans and Italians as to the success of the raid caused amusement and little credence will be given in future to news of Italian successes from Axissources. Public opinion in the Gulf remains generally steady. In KoweitHitler&apos;s meetings with the French and Spanish leaders have caused him to loseprestige. A further sum of  250 has been subscribed by British Indians inMuscat for the War Purposes Fund.[21909]
BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.4. General.The situation in the districts generally remains peaceful.On the 8th October U Ba U, an ex-Minister, was arrested under the Defenceof Burma Rules, at the instance of the Ministry, for making anti-war speeches.He is also suspected of being concerned in instigating violent measures againstthe Government.5. Press and Public Opinion.The reopening of the Burma Road has been welcomed by all branches of thepress. Both the English and the Burmese press are convinced that Japan willnot take extreme measures owing to the evidence of solidarity between the UnitedKingdom and the United States. The Burmese press thinks that Japan hasblundered in throwing in her lot with the Axis.On the other hand, there is a feeling in some quarters that the reopening of the Road may endanger Burma. At a meeting of the Buddhist PriestsAssociation, held on the 23rd October, a resolution was passed urging that the burma Road should be kept closed because of the danger of attack from Japan.6. Defence.Compulsory military service for Europeans has been introduced.Approval has been given for the establishment in Burma of an Officers&apos; CadetTraining Unit for Europeans and Burmans.7. External Relations.The Loiwing aircraft factory, belonging to the Inter-continent corporation of America, which is situated just beyond the Burma border and receives itssupplies via the Burma Road, was bombed by 36 Japanese aircraft on the 26th.At least 24 were killed and 40 injured; there were no American casualties. the damage was considerable, but could soon be made good provided that attacksare not repeated. There is reliable evidence that the aircraft violated british territory, and one bomb was dropped near a village 6 miles within the border,causing no casualties.8. Economic.(a) The number of trucks leaving Lashio for China since the Burma Roadwas reopened has averaged 135 daily as compared with approximately 100 per day during the month prior to the 18th October.(b) The September cost-of-living figures for Rangoon show increases over those of September 1939 of 16 per cent, and 12 per cent, for Burmans and Indiansrespectively, but no general demand for increased wages has been made on this account.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot;is used to cover not only the colonies inthe restricted sense, but also protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)9. Military Affairs.United States Bases.The United States Mission under Rear-Admiral Greenslade completed theirpreliminary examination of sites for naval, military and air bases in Bermuda,the Bahamas, Jamaica, Antigua, St. Lucia, Trinidad and British Guiana. in bermuda, their original proposals proved unacceptable, but as a result of a
further visit, during which they examined alternative proposals made by theGovernor, a solution satisfactory to all parties is likeby to be reached. There aredifficulties in Trinidad, and to a less extent in St. Lucia, but elsewhere thediscussions as to the sites have been progressing smoothly. All Governorsconcerned have agreed that, once a satisfactory site has been chosen, work maybegin without awaiting the settlement of administrative details which it isproposed to discuss in London later.Hong Kong.The defence policy of Hong Kong has been again examined by the Chiefs ofStaff, who had before them a memorandum by Sir Geoffrey Northcote, theGovernor, in which was raised the question whether, in view of the difficulty of defending the Colony, it should be demilitarized. It was decided to adhere tothe policy of defending the Colony as long as possible.M alaya.A Far Eastern Defence Conference met in Singapore towards the end ofOctober under the Chairmanship of the Commander-in-Chief, China Station.10. Situation in the French Colonies.(a) West and Equatorial Africa.Since the failure of the operation at Dakar, French West Africa has remainedsolidly pro-Vichy and such potential Free French supporters as exist have been obliged to remain in obscurity. The Vichy authorities are making strenuous efforts to improve the economic situation in the provinces of West Africa andtheir evident desire to convince the planters and trading community that they need not suffer by loyalty to Vichy shows the serious view which these authoritiestake of the economic appeal of adherence to the Free French movement. Vichyhas made similar efforts in the coastal part of Gabon, the one area in french equatorial Africa which has not rallied to General de Gaulle.The General himself arrived in Duala (French Cameroons) on the 8th October,followed by the majority of the Free French military and naval forces whichsailed with him from the United Kingdom, and his arrival seems to havestabilised the situation in French Equatorial Africa. He has now set up his headquarters in Brazzaville and at the end of October he paid a visit to theGovernor-General of the Belgian Congo at Leopolclville.Further steps have been taken to implement the pledges which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have extended to all Colonies rallying to the Free French movement.Most important among these measures are the stabilisation of the local francat 176-5/8 to the  , the granting of liberal advances for military, administrative and trade purposes, the purchase by His Majesty&apos;s Government of further-quantities of local produce and the supply of essential imports. The preparationof plans for long-term assistance to these Colonies on the same scale as thatgranted to British Colonies with a similar economic structure is far advanced.(b) French Somaliland.Discussions have taken place at Aden between the Acting Governor and twoFrench representatives sent from Jibuti. The French authorities desired ourco-operation in the import of supplies into Jibuti, and the evacuation from thereof four battalions of troops and a number of civilians. On instructions fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government the Acting Governor refused these facilities, and made it clear that supplies would be released only in return for suitableconcessions. At the same time a French supply ship for Jibuti detained at Adenwas requisitioned. On the 24th October the Governor of French Somalilandretaliated by ejecting from Jibuti the British Consul and his staff, but it seems that he still does not desire to break off relations completely.(c) Madagascar and Reunion.The position has been unfavourably affected by the events at Dakar and themeasures taken by the Vichy Government to counter the activities of Free Frenchsupporters.
(d) French West Indies.Here, too, the general effects of Dakar have been unfavourable. FrenchGuiana was visited by the Vichy cruiser Quercy from Martinique, and the localde Gaulle leader (Capitaine Chandon) now regards the prospects of a coup d&apos;Etat-as so poor that he has revived his earlier proposal of taking a contingent of free french volunteers to join General de Gaulle in Africa.(e) Pacific.The Free French Administrations in New Caledonia, the New Hebrides andthe Society Islands (Tahiti) are firmly established, and have been holdingdiscussions with the United Kingdom, Australian and New Zealand authoritiesabout the promise of economic and financial assistance contained in the PrimeMinister&apos;s letter to General de Gaulle of the 27th August.(f) General.On the 27th October General de Gaulle announced that he was forming a&apos;&apos; Council of Defence &apos;&apos; to exercise in the name of France all the powers of a warGovernment over those French Colonies which have rallied to him or may do soin the future. This announcement was made without prior consultation with HisMajesty&apos;s Government, who regard it as rather ill-timed in view of the presentsituation in France. Though His Majesty&apos;s Government do not propose to take exception to it, they intend to make it clear, if necessary, that, in their view,General de Gaulle is setting up a de facto Administration and not a de jureGovernment.11. Purchase of Colonial Produce Citrus.Arrangements have been made by His Majesty&apos;s Government for thepurchase of the 1940-41 citrus crops of the West Indies, including grape fruitfrom British Honduras and Trinidad, and sweet and bitter oranges from Jamaica,at prices which have been agreed to by Colonial Governments and the growers.The actual quantities bought will depend upon conditions in the United Kingdom,but it is intended to continue shipments throughout the season. Similar arrange-ments have been announced for the importation of fresh limes from the west indies and the Gold Coast. No settlement has yet been made for the disposalof the Palestine citrus crop, but it is feared that it will be impossible to ship itto the United Kingdom.Bananas. It is probable that there may be difficulty in shipping to theUnited Kingdom the whole of the bananas which will be available in Jamaica,and that they will have to be disposed of locally or in other markets at much below the ordinary export prices. A scheme for a marketing pool, with aminimum return to the grower guaranteed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, hasbeen submitted to the Ministerial Committee on Surpluses.12. Maintenance of supplies to Colonies.The first convoy from Egypt, containing four vessels filled with civil, militaryand other stores, arrived safely in Malta in early October. Further convoys willbe organised at intervals. At the request.of the Chiefs of Staff the governor of Gibraltar was asked for information about the state of his reserves, essentialsupply services and their protection. His full appreciation is being sent to theWar Office by air; his preliminary telegraphic reply showed that the situation was, on the whole, satisfactory.Reports on particular Colonies.13. Jamaica.Alexander Bustamente was detained under paragraph 1 of Defence Regula-tion 18 on the 8th September. His platform and journalistic activities, whichhad for some time past caused the Government embarrassment, culminated in a speech directly inciting to bloodshed, racial war and revolution, in spite of a personal warning given to him by the authorities.
14. Ceylon.A delegation of Ceylon Ministers is visiting India to attend the DelhiEconomic Conference and to hold exploratory discussions with representatives ofthe Government of India on outstanding points of difference between Ceylon andIndia, in particular on the subject of immigration of Indians into Ceylon. the ceylon Ministers, who are also members of the Ceylon National Congress, have arranged while in India to meet members of the Indian Congress, but substantialobjections are seen both here and by the Government of India to theirparticipating, even in a non-ministerial capacity, in such conversations with congress in India in present circumstances, and it is hoped that they may bedissuaded from doing so.15. Hong Kong.(a) Chinese Maritime Customs Office at Kowloon.The Governor has informed the Inspector-General of the Chinese MaritimeCustoms Service that, should the Japanese press their request (see last month&apos;sreport) for the inclusion of a Japanese commissioner on the staff of the ChineseCustoms Office at Kowloon, the Government of the Colony would have to considerinsisting on the withdrawal of the office from Hong Kong.(b) Immigration Restrictions.Legislation has been prepared to introduce a system of entry permits, &amp;c,so as to control the influx of Chinese population into the Colony, which constitutes a potential embarrassment to defence and public order. The introduction of thelegislation has been postponed pending a decision by His Majesty&apos;s Governmenton representations against the Bill by the Chinese Ambassador.(c) The termination of the Burma Road agreement.On the advice of the Acting Governor and of His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Tokyo, it has been decided, in the interests of the Colony, not to remove atpresent the restrictions on exports to China of certain commodities useful to china&apos;s war resistance, which were imposed under the Burma Road agreement,though it has been made clear to the Japanese Government that we reserve our right to do so if and when we think fit.16. Malaya.(a) Financial contributions.As a result of the War Loans issued in the Straits Settlements and theFederated Malay States, contributions of  2,400,000 and  2,300,000 respectivelyhave been made to His Majesty&apos;s Government for war expenditure. The contri-butions from the Straits Settlements loan are not yet complete. Further recentgifts from Malaya to His Majesty&apos;s Government included  100,000 as a personalloan free of interest from the Sultan of Johore, $50,000 and $30,000 fromTrengganu and Brunei war taxation and  1,000 from the Trengganu SpitfireFund. The Rajah of Sarawak has also offered the surplus revenue from theState&apos;s investments funds.(b) Japanese espionage.The measures taken against the Japanese national Shinozaki (see last month&apos;sreport) revealed the complicity of two further Japanese subjects in espionage Nagayama, the Japanese Consul-Generahs Private Secretary, who hurriedly leftSingapore, and Kashiwabara, a reporter, who has been arrested.(c) Chinese financial operations.The Acting Governor of the Straits Settlements has been instructed that,unless he sees further grave objection on local grounds, he should inform theChinese Consul-General that his request for permission for the transfer of certainstaff from the Chinese Ministry of Finance (see last month&apos;s report) to Singaporewill be granted. He has also been instructed to accede to a request for permission for Mr. Wu Teh-cheng, the Chinese Minister for Overseas Affairs, to visit]Malaya.
(d) Burma Road.The opening of the Burma Road has greatly encouraged pro-British senti-ment among Malayan Chinese.17. Aden.Early in October a party of the Royal Air Force travelling by car was stopped by tribesmen in the Western Protectorate, who demanded money and shot two of the party, one of whom was killed. Tribesmen in the area concerned have been restless of late owing to the construction of a motor road through their territory and their fear that the camel trade will be ruined. An agreement hasrecently been reached with the tribesmen by which the camel trade will be safe-guarded, but the discontent has not yet abated. Air action has been taken againstthe tribe concerned and a garrison of Government Guards has been posted intwo of the important villages in the area. At present five sections out of seventeen have submitted, and air action is continuing to enforce the submission of the remainder.Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Bernard Reilly, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., O.B.E., hasretired from the -Governorship of Aden and Mr. J. H. Hall, C.M.G., O.B.E.,D.S.O., M.C., at present Resident at Zanzibar, has been appointed to succeed him.18. Palestine.The original stimulus to pro-British sentiment arising out of the resistance to German attack offered in the British Isles has tended to lose its vigour, andthe general disposition is to sit on the fence. There are increasing signs of Axispropaganda and there is evidence that it is being disseminated through the IraqConsulate in Jerusalem and a relatively small circle of sophisticated anddisgruntled people.Recruiting for the Palestine Infantry Companies, which began last month,has been slow on the part of the Arabs; one Company (200) has been completed.There are indications that endeavours have been made by a number of Arabs to discourage recruitment either from hostility or in the hope of opportunities to drive a bargain, and there is also a lack of real interest. The two JewishCompanies initially required have been completed.This month again there were numerous incidents of violence and the numberof persons engaged seems to have increased to some extent. There are still no grounds for believing that the background to this lawlessness is other thanpersonal gain or spite. No doubt some gangsters are retmming to Palestine from iraq, but there is no evidence of marked success in rallying Fellaheen to themand as yet no sign that lawlessness has a political bias.19. Gibraltar.Difficulties have arisen over the re-evacuation of Gibraltarians from thiscountry to the West Indies (Jamaica and Trinidad). All arrangements for their reception have been made, but there is a strong disinclination on the part of thegreat majority to go overseas.20. Cyprus.The attack upon Greece has caused great indignation among Cypriots andhas led to a number of pro-Ally demonstrations.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,November 16, 1940.
