MINISTRY OF FOOD.    REPORT FOR JULY, 1940SUPPLY, CONSUMPTION, STOCKS, PRICES AND RATIONINGTTjTRODUC TIONPrior to the collapse of France the Ministry of Food was instructed toprepare an import programme for July - June 1940/L-1 on the hypothesis that themilitary situation would compel an immediate reduction in the rate of currentimports.     The instruction has been implemented, but as the hypothesis has beeninvalidated by events, it is hoped: that the new programme,&apos;and also those ofthe Board of Trade and the Ministry of; Supply, will be adapted to relate tothe second year of war (September - August 1940/41) and thus avoid overlappingthe programmes for the first year of war.The new twelve months&apos; programme is designed.bn a flexible basis to allowscope for the contraction of imports of certain commodities should enemy actionrender it impracticablei toi provide shipping for the full programme.     The minimumnutritional requirements of the human population must be met.     Substantialcontraction of the programme could therefore, only be effected at the expense ofthe proposed imports of animal feeds, the repercussions of which would quicklybe reflected&apos;in reduced supplies of livestock products, possibly including milk.The&apos;programme (&quot;excluding crude whale oil) totals 18.9 million tons compared with the pre-war five year average (1934/35 - 1938/39) of 22.9 million tons - a reduction of 4 million tons or 17* 5%*Losses at sea (97 thousand tons) combined with delayed arrivals of shipscaused a marked reduction in imports during July.     Total imports during thefirst year of war are now estimated at, 20.8 million.tons compared with lastmonth&apos;s estimate of 21 = 1 million tons.     The revised estimate exceeds the Ministry1 programme for the first year of war-by 750 thousand tons (the principal gain being640,000 tons of wheat and flour and the principal deficit being 400,000 tons ofcereal feeds).1.     GENERAL NOTE ON THE SUPPLY POSITION ,;  -The Tables and diagrams in the appendix56 depict the supply position ofthe principal foods and animal feeds.Stocks of all the. major commodities, with the exception of tea and sugar,are expected to be appreciably greater at the end of the first year of war thanin August 1939.The stock index of the major foods (i.e. the number of weeks&apos; supply interms of the equivalent calorie values.of the human food commodities shown inTable II, together with condensed milk and jam) declined from 12.2 at the end.of June to 10.7 weeks&apos; supply: at. the end of July.     The decline is due mainly to falls in wheat and sugar stocks.     In addition to the 10.7 weeks&apos; supply,an average stock equal to two weeks&apos;. requirements is estimated to be in the handsof retailers.     Stocks of animal feed at the end of July were sufficient tomaintain the present output of meat and livestock products for the period of 7.8weeks compared with 7 weeks, at the end of June.     None of these estimates takesinto account the increases in stocks added by.this yea^s home crop.s In the forecasts1 for.September and October no allowance has been made for possiblelosses at- sea     Shipping tonnage has not yet been arranged, for a large part ofthe October imports and the predictions for that month1 are therefore less accuratethan those for August and September.
Bulk stocks of wheat declined appreciably in July owing to reducedarrivals, but it is expected that the loss will be made good in August.Seasonal reductions in consumption, together with limited releases, increasedstocks of maize and oilcake.     Stocks of oilseeds and oils were maintained^Stocks of meat, bacon, butter, sugar and tea have declined.     The decrease insugar stocks was due mainly to seasonal releases for jam making.     Rationinghas arrested the fall in tea stocks.2.     WHEATy FLOUR AND BREAD(in terms of wheat)Total U.K. stocks on 3rd August 2,201,000 tons estimated weekly total. consumption (August) 139,000   &quot;Estimated weekly consumption as flour   &quot; 1.25 $000   &quot;Partly because heavy sinkings.reduced arrivals,reserve.stocks ofwheat and flour at the end of July were equivalent to 14.4 weeks1, supply (atthe average rate of consumption of flour in the past three months) comparedwith 15.7 week&apos;s supply at the end of June,Stocks of flour, at the end of July, including reserve and workingstocks,.amounted to 7*7 weeks1 requirements, dispersed as follows:per cent of    No, of week&apos;total   . supplyMillers (home produced) 44 3.4Government owned (imported) - , 32 2.5Bakers, wholesalers and retailers (estimated) 24 1.8- 100     - 7.7Substantially all stocks of flour, with the exception of 1-g- weeks&apos;working supplies held at the mills and&apos;also bakers1 and retailers&apos; stocks, havebeen removed from a belt ten miles wide along the south and east coasts ofEngland.     Stocks in mills and warehouses in the South-Eastern Pood Divisionhave been reduced to 19 days&apos; supply.-&quot;   Otherwise, the stocks are well dispersedin a large number of stores throughout the country;     no Food Division having,less than 27 days&apos; requirements in mills and warehouses.The Ministry of Food&apos;s second year of war   wheat import programme is ,250,000 tons.     At the beginning of August the Ministry held overseas, spotand futures, 4,795,000 tons of wheat distributed as follows:     Canada 3,457,000Australia 888,000 and Argentina 450-000 tons.The new home crop of wheat is tentatively put at 1,670,000 tons whichis the 1934/8 average figure. -   Farmers- are obliged to continue to sell theirwheat only to approved buyers who in turn must sell (excluding wheat for seed)at least 50% of their purchases for milling into flour.The 1940/41 exportable surplus of wheat in the four principal exporting countries is tentatively put at 28.4 million tons -(Argentina 2.7, Australia 4,3,Canada 16.3 and United States 5.1 million tons) against a total world (excludingenemy countries) import demand of not more than 10.7 million tons.Yeast manufacturers have been requested to hold a reserve of about,one week&apos;s requirement in addition to their oxdinary working stock of 2.-3days&apos; supply, and bakers have been urged to stock 3 &quot; 4 days&apos; requirementson their own premises.     Pressed yeast, which is the type normally used bybakers, can only be stored satisfactorily for short periods, and the proposedreserves will be limited to 10 - 14 days&apos; supply.     The present rate ofpressed yeast production, temporarily inflated to provide reserves, is 715 tons per week compared with the pre-war production of 4&amp;5 tons per week and animported weekly supply of about l80 tons.. As a precaution against the loss of the principal yeast factories orthe breakdown of yeast distribution machinery, bakers have been advised toexperiment with alternative methods published by the Ministry and to hold stocks
s   The decision to reduce the September allocations to 33% has been ma.desince Tables I and II were prepared.of malt extract or dried yeast or make local arrangements to obtain brev/ersyeast so that, in an emergency, they can still produce a reasonably satisfactorydough for baking.3.     ANIMAL FEEDSMaize Barley      Oilcakes(&apos;000 tons)Total U.K. stocks on 3rd August 223 241 267Estd. total weekly consumption (August)        28 15 13Despite the arrival of 21,000 tons of maize originally consigned tothe Continent, total imports of maize and barley in July were only 5O/0 of theimport programme.     Imports in August are expected to be about 70% of programme,but arrivals in September and October will be very small, partly because of the priority being given to wheat and partly because of the additional slippingrequired for steel from the U. S.A,At the end of July the Ministry of Food held 430 thousand tons of maize in the U. S., 90 thousand tons of maize in Rhodesia, approximately 215thousand tons of maize in Argentina and 70 thousand tons of barleyin Iraq,Diverted cargoes accounted for 66% of the total arrivals of oilcakesin July which were slightly above programme.     August imports are expected to beabout 66% of programme, but prospective imports in September and October arevery low.     The 1940/41 buying programme for oilcakes has been re-arranged so asto replace on a ton-for-ton basis the supplies of undecorticated cottonseed whichit was formerly intended to obtain from Egypt.     Taking the programme as a whole,the average feeding value per ton will be slightly higher than before there-arrangement,Releases for consumption of oilcakes and of imported maize and barleyin July were 50% of &quot;datum&quot; vi.e. 1/I2th of 1936/39 average annual imports of maize and barley;   1/I2th of total supplies of oilcakes in 1938/39)0     releases in August are based on 40% of the same- &quot;datum&quot;, and releases in September willbe 33%,M   part of the new home cereal crops now being available.     With the approach of winter feeding, releases in October should be substantially increased,but as arrivals of imported maize and barley are estimated to be very small inSeptember and October,it has been assumed, in forecasting the stock position tothe 2nd of November, that the August rate (i.e, 40% of datum) of release of imported cereals will be adopted in October.     The new home crops are nowforecasted at 1,231,000 tons of barley and 2,627,000 tons of oats, compared withthe 1934/38 averages of 770,000 tons and 1,987,000 tons respectively.     RecentOrders will further control the prices of the new crops of home grown cereals and pulses, and the trade will be canalised through &quot;approved buyers&quot;.Further advance allocations to merchants and farmers of cereals andoilcakes for storage were made in July and are being continued, in the case ofcereals, in August.     At the end of-July approximately 50% of the total stocksof maize and oilcakes and of imported barley and wheat offals were dispersedthroughout the country, part of the stocks of oilcakes being held by farmers.The Ministry of Food is now renting stores in country districts for part of thereserve stocks and a survey is being made of compounders1 and dealers1 unfilledstorage space.It is not yet possible to make detailed estimates of the total suppliesof feed concentrates available for the winter season, but prospective supplies(home produced and imported) in the second year of war should, provided theMinistry of Food&apos;s total import programme is implemented, approximate to 85%of the average pre-war supplies.The 194Q/4I  (April-March) exportable surplus of Argentine maize isestimated at&apos;about 9 million tons;     the U.S. 1940/41 (November/October)exportable surplus maize is put at approximately 11 million tons.     The U.S.1940/41 (July-June) exportable surplus of barley is estimated at about million tons.

Government will purchase all ofthe cotton seed offered to. it.     The agreed purchase price is high, judged hy thecost of recent purchases in Egypt and*East Africa, but the resale price charged to the Ministry of Pood will be determined by the prevailing prices of otheroilseeds.The production of vegetable oils during July averaged 12 thousand tonsa week, as compared with 15 in June and 14 in Lay,     The decline is attributedmainly to the discontinuance of week-end overtime and to repair work, normallycarried out in August.     Some time was lost in Hull and Bristol due to air raids,but this was not an important factor.Whale oil stored in American ports is being shipped from November onwards.5.   MARGARINE AND LARD ,Allocations to manufacturers of oils in August are calculated to produce7,800 tons of margarine and 2,500 tons of compound lard a week as compared with6,100 tons and 3,000 tons respectively in July.It is too early to record the effect of the rationing regulations onthe consumption of margarine and cooking fats.   The distribution of fats to tradeconsumers during August is being limited to 75f0 of datum (i. e. 1th of the FebruaryJuly 1939 average). 6 in order to secure economies in distribution and transport, allmanufacturers of margarine and compound lard have agreed to merge their sellingorganisations in a new company called Marcom Ltd,     The Ministry of Pood has.appointed two representatives to be members of the Board of this Company.Manufacturing formulae have been standardised.Stocks of imported animal lard are approximately 12,000 tons, equivalentto 24 weeks&apos; supply at the present rate of distribution.No discussions have taken place recently with the cuppPying countries;for the time being.Argentina appears to have acquiesced in the shipment of only,500 tons per week - the quantity to which the Ministry has restricted imports in recent months.     Negotiations for supplies from September onwards will shortly be opened with all supplying countries.&apos;Agreement has been reached with Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil for thiscountry to take, for shipment during August, September and October, the 21, COO tonsof beef which the Ministry had contracted for on behalf of the French&apos; Government,6.MEATTotal G.B, stocks on 3rd AugustEstimated weekly consumption (August)(imported only)139,000 tons19,000     &quot;
Prospective supplies from overseas during the next five months, are less than formerly expected,,     Losses of meat at sea due to enemy actionamounted to 1,500 in June, 10,600 in July, and 5,5C0 in the first fortnightof August.     Home supplies increased during July and are expected to continueto increase until   October-November,   This seasonal increase may. on account ofthe shortage of feeding stuffs, be more marked than usual this year.    unlessspecial measures have to be taken owing to imports being seriously affected by enemy action, the proposals of the Moyne Committee (if put into effect) will tend to reduce the autumn glut by providing (for home supplies) a greaterseasonal price advantage for winter-fattened stock, thus encouraging farmers to hold their stock off the autumn markets,,     A   proposal to raise the ration bya small amount for a limited period is under consideration.The distribution of meat (ex offal) consumption by categories of thepopulation during the four weeks ending 29th June and the 5 weeks ending3rd August was as follows:JuneTonsJulytonsFighting ServicesManuf acttirersCaterersCivilians Ya) on ration(b) pork12,cco8, co-:101,5006,0 co142,20018,60016,8C010,000143,2007,600196,300The Ministry-has purchased 25^000 tons of coined beef from Argentina,Brazil, Uruguay, Australia and New Zealand, and sanction is being sought topurchase a further 16,000 tons.     Stocks of corned beef are still being reservedfor the Services and emergencies3   Losses of canned meat at sea amounted to3,4 thousand tons in July.7.   BACON AND HAM ..Total GaB. Stocks on 3rd August ..Estimated Weekly Consumption (August)26,1C0 tons 8,125     &quot;Releases of bacon and ham for consumption by the general public averaged7,836 tons per week in July, which was 21% more than the weekly average for June.It has been decided as from 26th August to restrict supplies of boiling jointsand cooked bacon and ham (which are sold off the ration) to the general public.Further restriction of unrationed supplies may be necessary in the near future as the prospective position is-. unsatisfactory.   Pig producers have not so fardrastically reduced their herds and home production of bacon and ham is expectedto increase slightly during the next few months consequent upon the recent decision to utilise for bacon all pigs of bacon weights, but the curing capacityof the industry is at present limited by labour shortage and prospectivesupplies from Northern Ireland are smaller.Under arrangements which have been made to expedite shipments from Canada,it is expected that 7,000 tons of October bacon will arrive during September,,Prospective total supplies and cojisumption indicate that by the end of Octoberbulk stocks will have fallen to the low level of 14,000 tons, and if the 4 oz.ration is to be maintained, increased supplies from overseas must be procured.8.   SUGARTotal U,K, . Stocks, on 3rd August . 402,000 tons estimated weekly consumption includingexports (August) 47,600     &quot;Heavy seasonal, withdrawals in July and August for fruit preservation(in July releases for domestic jam making alone were as great as those to cover&quot;the normal ration) are responsible for the decline in stocks during those, months.yj a
Although considerable quantities of sugar originally consigned to the Continenthave been directed to this country^&apos; these have been largely off-set&apos;by-the&quot; .increased, time lags in arrivals of other sugar \;hich have- occurred lit&quot;-recent t    -weeks and which,&apos; if continued, will have a marked effect on forecasts, of &quot;stockslater in the year. &quot;     &quot;-    -&apos;- - - -&apos;&quot;*:-The Ministry has purchased, forward.^ for arrival during September/August-1940/41, 1-5- million tons of sugar;&apos; - total imports in- the first year of &quot;War are --&apos;estimated at about 1.7 million tons.    (One result of the -recent heavy declinein sugar prices has been the freezing by the&apos;-&quot;banks, of large stocks in&apos; India. -If these stocks are released, the llnistry will &apos;be morally bound to take asubstantial proportion of them).     Reduced requirements, imposed by rationing, willbe reflected in relatively small second jeax &quot;of war purchase in foreigncountries.Recent rains have&apos; greatly improved, the outlook for the hone crop and/subject to adequate labour and transport being available, the sugar equivalent of the crop is now estimated at 400,000 to 450,000 tons.       Since, however, alarge part of the crop is produced, and many of the sugar-beet factories arelocated in the eastern coastal area, an appreciable proportion of the crop maynot be safely garnered, and ]processed.Heavy further increases in ocean freight and insurance rates have forsome time past involved the llnistry In losses on its sugar account, and, in&apos;order to offset these losses, the retail price of sugar Is being increased,on 26th August, from 4^.. to 5d.. per lb.9.   I.LCLKThe consumption&apos;.of liquid milk during July --1940 ( 76 million-gallons) was nearly 2 million gallons - greater than in. July 1939.    Part of this increase(360,000 gallons) was accounted for-by &quot;school milk&quot; sales.    - (Nevertheless...of  .the. 6-g-million children. eligible- , pr -milk under the milk in schools scheme only,about 3^: million are obtaining milk at schools).     The ba.le.nce is attributed, to higher consumption by men now In the Services and to the national cheap milkscheme for mothers and children.     It is not possible s.t present to determinehow much the latter scheme has increased, milk consumption. -    At the&apos; end of Julypermits had. been issued for 1,750,000 mothers and.- children, out of an estimatedpossible total of 3,895,000.       Approximately a quarter of the permits were for free milk.-Production of milk during the coming winter&apos;months depends on the-, --.-&apos;   .feeding-stuffs position,&apos; out present estimates indicate a reduction of the,    - ; -.order of 10^ compared with the corresponding months of 1938/9.&apos;   If consumption is increased by the national cheap milk scheme and if the-milk -in schools schemeis made more embracing, there maybe some shortage of supplies In the laterwinter months.The quantity of milk used for manufacturing purposes, in July 1940 was54 million gallons, i.e. 10.7 million gallons less, than -in. July 1939.Utilisation for butter and cream showed the greatest decreases,   llanuf3.ctureof tinned, and. bottled, cream has been prohibited, as from 29th July and freshcream is being restricted, to 50/. of the quantity manufactured, during May 1940.It is proposed, to prohibit the sale of all kinds of cream as from 1st October..-10.    CONDENSED ItCLKThe quantity of condensed mill: being released for the retail trs.de isbeing increased from the June/July level of 45% of the datum quantity (i.e. theaverage monthly quantity in 1938) to 50$ for sldmmed, 60&apos;fo for full creamunsweetened, and &quot;75% for full cream sweetened.     Complaints having been receivedabout the uneven distribution of these short supplies, it is proposed .toregulate by order wholesale sales from September onwards.     The restriction onsales of bulk condensed milk is being continued..A large proportion of the purchases me.de in the U.S.A. (totalling.30*000 tons) has already been, shipped.     Arrangements have been made to purchase6,000 tons of sidLomed and. 1,500 tons of full cream condensed, milk in Eire.
-jl,   BUTTERTotal stocks in United Kingdom on 3rd August      52,000 tons estimated weekly-consumption (August) 6,900     &quot;When the combined butter and margarine ration was made operative it wasnecessary to ensure that retailers and sufficient stocks of each commodity tomeet alternative demands with the result that their holdings exceeded the require-ments to meet the 6 oz. joint ration.During the first two weeks of the new rationing regulations, thedistribution through wholesalers of butter for household consumption amountedto 5 ozs. per head per week, as against 3l&quot; ozs. during the period of the 4 oz,ration.     Since this increase meant that more butter was being distributed thanthe stocks and prospective supply position oould.maintain,   some restrictionhad to be placed on withdrawals from the Ministry&apos;s stocks.The total quantity distributed during the four weeks to 23rd Septemberis, therefore, being limited to that required to provide an average ration of 4 ozs.     In consequence, some limitation of choice  by consumers may occurpending the determination of the quantities required in each locality.The present forecast of stocks shows a greater decline than the forecastsiven a month, ago.     The previous forecasts were based on the assumptionwhich has not materialised) that distribution of butter under the combinedration would not exceed the rate under the 4 oz, ration.It is estimated that 15,000 tons of: butter from Argentina could be shipped before April 1941 (i. e. equivalent to nearly 3 weeks&apos; supply,given a 4 oz. ration).     Pending a general financial agreement with theArgentine Government, Treasury sanction has been granted for a purchase of only 4,000 tons, of which 1,500 tons will be shipped in August/September, 1940.12.   CHEESETotal stocks in United Kingdom on 3rd August       23,000 tons estimated weekly consumption (August) 3,700   *&quot;Manufacturers (both creamery and farmhouse) of the more importantvarieties of cheese produced in this country have been licensed under theCheese (Licensing &amp; Control) :0rder.All such cheese made on and from 1st August becomes the property ofthe Ministry of Pood.     Under the full control scheme which will be inoperation at the beginning of October, supplies will be allocated to thetrade on the basis of turnover in a datum period.     It is not anticipated thatthe total quantity distributed will be reduced in the immediate future.Contracts for 1940/41 supplies from Australia and New Zealand havebeen practically completed.     They provide- for increases of 2,000 tons and15,000 tons respectively over the quantities contracted for in 1939/40, thetotal increase amounting to 15%.     Small quantities of cheese may be availablein the United States, but the prices requested operate against their purchase.13.   EGGSSupplies of eggs in shell in July 1940 (home produced and imported)were only about 60% of the July 1939 figure;   imported supplies being less thanone-third of last yearVs level.     The following table summarises the forwardposition:

Releases of private stocks of pickled eggs will depend on thecourse of prices.The scheme for controlling the distribution of imported eggs will be infull operation from 2nd September.     A new scheme of control of prices of home-produced eggs will be put into force at an early date.     This scheme provides,by means of price differentials, an inducement to producers to sell their eggs toauthorised packing stations from which a reasonable proportion of the eggs will &quot;be sold to the large centres of consumption.     The scheme will thus correct thetendency to sell an undue proportion of eggs near the points of production whichwould otherwise be encouraged by the fixing of uniform maximum prices under conditions of scarcity. &quot; - &apos;The retail price of eggs as quoted by the Ministry of Labour was 2/6d. perdozen on 1st August, compared with l/9d. per dozen at the same date last year.The general price policy has been to ensure to producers, by means of Maximum PricesOrders, an increase of about 40% over average pre-war prices to meet increased costs of production.14.    TEATotal United Kingdom stocks on 3rd AugustEstimated United Kingdom weekly consumption including exports (August)107 million lbs.7.4       &quot; &quot;Arrivals of tea are expected to approximate to normal consumption during august and September and to be heavy during the following months.     If rationing is continued, stocks at the end of December are forecast at .176 million lbs. morethan on 3rd August.The purchase of 40 million lbs. from Java has been completed;    31 million of this tea are expected to arrive in October and the balance in November.Purchase contracts so far made in 1940 total 567 million lbs. of which about 193 million lbs. have been shipped or are awaiting shipment.    Completion ofthe delivery to f*o.b. points of the balance (374 million lbs) is expected byFebruary 1941.15.    DRIED FRUITThe quantity of dried fruit likely to be available for distribution tothe trade before Christmas is now estimated at only 50% of normal.
While the position in the Mediterranean is still unclarified, it is improbable that supplies from Greece and Turkey can reach this country in timefor the Christmas trade.The U.S. 1940/41 exportable surplus of prunes is estimated at100,000 short tons, raisins 150,000 short tons and other dried fruits 25,000 shorttons.16.   RICETotal stocks on 3rd August 57,000 tonsEstd. weekly consumption (August) 5,750     &quot;(including sales to unlicensedpurchasers)During May/July licensed imports of rice exceeded the import programme&quot;by about 25% and, owing to arrivals originally consigned to the Continent, totalimports exceeded the May/July import programme by over 80%.Much of the rice which has been diverted to this country is of lowquality, but recent experiments have indicated that it can be used by brewers anddistillers,     A process for converting it into acceptable human food has been devised and is being left to commercial development.     Rice has now largelyreplaced maize in brewing and both distillers and starch makers have increased their utilisation.     Glucose manufacturers cannot use rice without altering theirplants which they are not prepared to do unless assured continuity of supplies.17,   POTATOESOwing to the much better growing weather, crop prospects have improvedmaterially and while yields may still be affected adversely by climatic conditions,the yield per acre on agricultural holdings in Great Britain is tentativelyput at 7,3 tons (as compared with 7.4 in 1939) indicating a total crop of about million tons (the largest prospective crop for any year since 1922 and, owingto the increase in acreage, exceeding last season&apos;s output by over half amillion tons),18.   SHIPPINGArrivals including diverted cargoes of foods and animal feeds, excludingunrefined whale oil, in July totalled only 1,402,000 tons compared with ,005,000 tons in June and 2,029,000 tons in May.     August arrivals are-, however,estimated at 1,851,000 tons, 449,000 tons or 52% greater than imports in July,Losses of foods and feeds through sinkings by enemy action amounted to96,000 tons in July (including 49,000 tons of wheat and flour, 15,000 tons of animal feeds, 14,000 tons of meat, frozen and canned, and 7,000 tons of sugar)compared with 64,000 tons in June and 11,000 tons in May (all these figures excludeloss of cargo in damaged vessels).     Against the heavy July losses can be set the arrival in the same month of 223,000 tons of cargo originally destined for enemy-occupied territories (including 96,000 tons of oilseeds and oils,46,000 tons of sugar, 45,000 tons of animal feeds and 22,000 tons of wheat and flour).Shipping delays, following the entry of Italy into the War and themeasures taken to meet the intensified effort of the enemy at sea, are clearly
reflected in the following weekly arrivals of wheat and flour:Week ending 29th June 173.000 tons&quot;        6th July 70,000 &quot;&quot;       13th July 40,000 &quot;&quot;       20th July 67,000 &quot;27th July 129,000 &quot;&quot;       3rd   August 141,000 &quot;&quot;       10th August 179,000 &quot;In Argentina the extra tonnage expected for additional wheat has notmaterialised for August/September loading.     Owing to the pressing demand for steel, the tonnage allocation to foods and feeds in Noi-th America forAugust/September loading is much below programme.     Canada is continuing topress for the clearance of storage now occupied by our wheat, and we have430,000 tons of U.S.A. maize to lift before mid-October.     There is ashortage of tonnage in India for August/September loading, and it has been necessary to hold back shipments of linseed and rapeseed in favour of tea,groundnuts, and pulses.19.     OVERSEAS SURPLUSES OF FOODS AND ANIMAL FEEDSThe Ministry has for some weeks been working in close co-operationwith the other Departments concerned on the immense task of how to ease theburdensome surpluses problem, greatly accentuated by our blockade of theContinent of Europe.     Memoranda on the international aspects of 19 differentcommodities have been prepared for the Secretariat of the Economic PolicyCommittee^ Sub-Committee on Surpluses.Consideration is being given to the possibility of purchasingfoodstuffs in French, Belgian and Dutch Colonies in order to relieve theirpressing surplus problems, and thus prevent a collapse of their economic and social order.     Great difficulties arise, however, from the fact that in thecase of most of the commodities, the supplies available in the British Empireare more than sufficient to meet the needs of the U.K. market.     A purchaseof 40 million lbs. of tea from the Netherlands East Indies has, however, beenmade, and further purchases are being considered.     Since the beginning ofJuly 100,000 tons of sugar have been purchased from the same source.20.      THE CONSUMERReta.il Food Prices(Retail Food Prices Index:     July 1914 * 100)1939 19401st July 139 1681st August 137 1641st September 138 -The Food Index fell by 4 points, or about 2^ per cent, between &apos;1st July and 1st August.     The principal changes were in potatoes and eggs.The maximum price of home-produced and Irish eggs was increased by 3d. a dozen in July.     As forecast- in last month&apos;s report, the sharp increasein the retail price of potatoes has been followed by a substantial fall asthe main potato crop came to market.A further seasonal rise in the price of eggs is expected and the retail price of sugar will be increased from 41^. to 5d. per lb. on26th August.     Prices of potatoes should continue to decline, though the fall, dc
the favourable crop prospects, may be loss than in pre-war years.     The PoodIndex will thus probably show an advance of one or two points at 1st September.NutritionThe field work on the first quarterly surve5^ of the food consumption ofa random sample of 2,000 working class households has now been completed.    Theresults should be available shortly and will, it is hoped, indicate whether,since the outbreak of war, there have been any changes in the incidence ofmalnutrition amongst the lower income, groups of the population.The object of the modified &quot;Oslo Meal&quot;, which is normally communallyfed, is to provide as cheaply as possible and with the minimum utilisation of fuel, a substantial proportion of the daily requirements of vitamins and mineralsthus minimizing the risk that the consumption in the home of an ill-balanceddiet will lead to malnutrition or ill-health.     The experiments at workscanteens, referred to in last month&apos;s report, now include a hot &quot;Oslo Meal&quot;,consisting of a hot dish followed by a salad (or raw fruit), wholemeal bread,oheese, coffee or cocoa;   the total ingredients cost 6d, to 7d. per meal.It is intended to extend the experiments to factories where the work is heavy.RationingThe commodities now (August 20th) rationed to individuals are:per head per week......Meat     ...      o..Bacon and hamButter and/or margarineS\l^ fil* * a * o * * a a a * 4) * a a *Cooking fats (or margarine in lieu)* * * m m m * * o c * * * * *1/lOd. worth (say 1^ to if lbs. )4 ozs.6 ozs.8 ozs.2 ozs.2 ozs.s lid. worth to children under 6 yearsThese, and other commodities as well, are also rationed to manufacturers andcaterers (except in the case of tea).The introduction of tea rationing on 9th July resulted in some increasein the sales of ground coffee, coffee essence and cocoa.     The effect of the combined butter and margarine ration has been to increase butter consumption.The question whether this increase must be limited by restricting the option to take the whole of the combined ration in the form of butter is under urgent consideration.     No extension of rationing to other commodities is intended inthe immediate future.Communal FeedingA survey now nearing completion suggests that existing catering establishments in the United Kingdom (excluding special types such as industrial,Civil Defence and Service canteens and school feeding centres) could provide2 to 2-g- million cooked meals at one sitting.     The data have been analysed bydistricts in order to expedite communal feeding should it be required in anemergency.     The catering facilities available in social service centres arealso being ascertained.It is intended to set up tr/o experimental national kitchens and thepossibilities of using mobile field kitchens for emergency feeding are being investigated.

(By the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in conjunction with the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for the Home Department)August 15 th, 1%-Q.Crop Cond-itions:   England and   ales:   August 1st:Expected corn yields per acre are:   wheat,. 95 per cent, of normal;barley, 98 per cent.;    oats, 99 per cent.;,   beans, 79 per cent., and. peas, 103per cent.     Results on newly ploughed, up land, are very variable.    Straw- is mostlydeficient in length.Potatoes should prod.uce a yield equal to 101 per cent, of normal; turnips,%Jr per cent.;   mangolds^ 100 .per cent, and. sugar beet, 100-g- per cent.    The hopscrop is now doing well.Rains have improved, the pastures, but grass is still somewhat short forthe time of the year and. milk yields are slightly below normal.   The condition of cattle and sheep is satisfactory.Crop Conditions:    Scotland..Grain crops promise average yields, said the prospective yields of potatoes and. roots have increased..     Dairy and feeding cattle have made good,progress, and. both hill and. lowland, sheep have improved, in condition.Crop Conditions:   Northern Ireland.Conditions of corn and root crops in Northern Ireland, are similar tothose in England and Wales.     The grass-seed, harvest has been nearly completed,with fair results, and flax pulling is now- in progress.General:Farm survey now being completed will show areas suitable for ploughing.On present information it appears that it should, be possible to plough up 1-g- to2 million additional acres in the United. Kingdom,Within any total that emerges the Scottish share, which is fixed fairlydefinitely, will be 280,000 acres.     It is hoped, to keep the consequentialdecline in livestock numbers to a small figure.hachinerv:An Order has been made requiring all agricultural contractors in Englandand Wales to register with their War Agricultural Executive Committees, and iving Committees power to control the operations of such contractors.     Theobject is to secure a greater measure of organisation of the machinery and implements available and eliminate the wasteful overlapping of areas served, by individual contractors.     In Scotland. Executive Committees have been asked, toorganise the use of available machines on a voluntary basis.Seed^ and. Fertilisers:The normal sources of supply of a number of kinds of agricultural and vegetable seeds now being cut off, all possible steps are being taken to increase production at home and to purchase extra supplies,, so far as they are available,some on Government account, from other seed, producing countries.     Seeds likelyto be in short supply are tares, rape, peas, beans, onion, carrot and leek,Potassic fertiliser is now scarce since the French source of supply hasbeen cut off.     Farmers have been directed, to limit its use to potatoes, sugar&quot;beet, market garden crops (other than fruit), flax, and, other crops in a few/light
light land districts seriously deficient in potash. Restrictions are also&quot;being imposed on the manufacture of compound fertilisers containing potash.The arrangements to increase the supply of basic slag by transportingIOC,000 tons with Government assistance to plants with a surplus grindingcapacity, have been completed.Ilan-Power: .Preliminary figures show that male regular irorkers decreased by only6,200 between June 1939 and June 194-0 and. that casual and female &quot;workersincreased by 12,800.     Since probably at least 60,000 men left agricultureduring the year for military service or other industries, it seems that atleast 50,000 other workers returned, to agriculture or were newly recruited.This degree of replacement is numerically satisfactory, but it is ahnostcertain that the Incomers are on the average inferior in quality to theoutgoers.There continues to be no exceptional demand for labour.     The demand, is largely for skilled workers but there is a shortage of casual workers incertain counties.In Scotland the revised minimum wage rates came into force on July 22nd.The rates are being examined in detail by the Central Wages Board r/ith a viewto referring back to the &quot;Cages Committees for reconsideration where thought necessary.Feeding-stuffs and Livestock;L small Committee has been appointed to consider the controlleddistribution of feeding-stuffs by rationing fanners or by other methods,including any special arrangements which might be needed in the event of astate of siege.-  There has been a considerable increase in the number of bacJyard poultrykeepers.     A Domestic Poultry Keepers&apos; Council for England and Cales is being appointed to organise and guide this movement, particularly to ensure that full use is made of household and garden waste, and that only a aini-duiasupplement of purchased food is used.The Scheme for dispersing stores of oil cakes and meals by -releasingpart of their advance requirements to farmers has now been put into operation.ICilk Production in the United Kingdom (million gallons).Liquid llanuf aoturing TotalJuly, 1939 74.5 54.1 128.6June, 1940 73.9 50.4 124.3July, 1940 76.0 43.3 119.3The decline in production compared with a year ago is principally due tograss having been particularly abundant last July and being rather scanty thisJuly.       Liquid consumption, however, has increased.Aninal Health:There have been two outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in Devonshiresince the la.st Report.       On account of swine -fever special movementrestrictions are in force in Aberdeenshire and Cornwall.
