This represented a considerable reduction on the figures for the previous month,The figures for June were exceptionally high and enabled the civilstorage capacity of the country to be practically filled.     during july readjustments had to be made in convoy arrangements due tothe closing of the English Channel to large tankers and the use ofthe &quot;north-about&quot; route to reach the East Coast;    while during thelatter part of the month West Coast ports had to be reached via the Northern Ireland route.

Consumption of Motor Spirit by the War Officeincreased in the U.K. by 9,600 tons, and overseas consumption(B.E.F. ) disappeared. As regards aviation spirit, home consumption in July was on the same level as in June at 35,000 tons.Consumption overseas showed a net decrease of 500 tons.Civil consumption in July was practically the same as in June.STOCKS.The stocks position continues in general satisfactory.(a) Services.Admiralty stocks of fuel oil, at home were 15,000 tonslower:    there was no material change in stocks held abroad.Air Ministry stocks of aviation spirit in the U.K. were6j000 tons higher and War Office stocks of motor spirit in theU.K.  decreased by   10,000 tons.(b) Civil.Civil stocks were 37,000 tons less than the stocks held!&apos;     at the end of June.P.T.0

Thetotal tonnage involved is 164,000 tons at an estimated costto the Government of  50,000.     A further programme is underconsideration.With regard to the schemes previously approved, thereare now 111 tanks with walls 50% or more complete, out of atotal of 250.Damage by enemy action.during the month, apart from the incident at Saltendwhich was referred to in last month&apos;s report, there? were three instances where damage occurred at oil installations.(l) On 10th July two atta:cks were made on the National oil refineries (Anglo-Iranian Oil Company) premises at Llandarcy,In the first, about 12 bombs were dropped,, none of whichexploded as their percussion fuses had not been set.    In thesecond, four bombs were dropped, three of which exploded.The only serious damage&apos;&apos; was to the section of the refineryfor the treatment of kerosene, which was put out of commission Ifor the time being.     Alternative arrangements for working thisjpart of the refinery in a simplified form have since been made!A small quantity of kerosene in the plant was lost.      Threepeople were killed and one injured.The refinery was closed down for a period of 48 hours inorder to deal with the unexploded bombs.(2) On 11th July an attack was made on a small distributing depotBridlington, and damage was caused to a can-filling store,buildings and two kerosene tanks,      38 tons of kerosene were&quot;lost.&apos; . , i(3) On 19th July an attack was made on oil installations at plymouth.
