(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT).secret.P.  (R) (i+G) 212.26th December, 1940*WAR CABINETEc economic V/a rf a re .I attach, for the information of my colleagues,a brief report for the month of November, 1940*H.D.

i , General.During November the tendency to rely more upon the controlof shipping, the regulation of neutral exports and the exerciseof financial power, and less upon contraband and enemy export control, was accentuated.A more constructive policy, with careful safeguards, wasadopted towards certain European neutrals, especially Spain and portugal, Switzerland, Sweden and Finland.Efforts were continued to secure American collaboration in the field of export licensing and shipping control, with aview to restricting supplies of key corarnodities for Japan and russia which might go through to the enemy.2,     The Regulation of Shipping and Control at the Source.Neutral ships wishing to use facilities in British ports en route to European waters must now hold ships warrants and carry onlyfully navicerted cargoes.      In some cases American oil companies have assisted us by themselves denying bunkering facilities to non-warrant holders.British credits have been everywhere denied to ships notholding warrants, though some relaxation has been permitted inthe case of Japanese trade with British possessions in the Pacificand Indian Ocean, whose exports are in any&apos;case controlled bylicence.Similarly, insurance in the British market is denied to non-warrant holders, while the American market tends to collaboratevoluntarily by declining to ensure and re-insure risks not acceptedby the English.Thus, the ships warrant scheme is now in full&apos;operation so faras European waters are concerned. The possibility and efficacy of applying it to the Pacific is being worked out.3. Financial Pressure.Our informal liaison with the United- States authorities hasbecome closer and more effective, and prompt action is usually .-.taken in Washington and New York upon information supplied by us.Shortly after the recent changes in Roumania an attempt to use herdollar balances in New York to purchase the Iranian cotton.crop forthe ultimate benefit of Germany was defeated by the refusal of an american exchange licence; and., on the strength of information supplied by the Ministry of Economic Warfare, one important&apos; &quot;employee of an. American firm was sent for a long holiday by--his.:.- .employers after his return to the United States from Europe,Portuguese, Swedish and South American banks were increasinglyused during November as a cloak for enemy financial transactions.This nuisance, which is of great value to the enemy, will not be fully stopped until enemy credits In the United States are blockedand some scheme devised to prevent looted gold and gold of enemy origin being indirectly converted into dollars.
4.    The treatment of European Neutrals.While the air and press have been full of words about theGerman new order in Europe we have been able, in close cooperationwith the other Departments concerned, to assist the economies of some European countries which would otherwise have suffered severely from a purely negative insistence upon the blockade.Thus, while we have insisted upon definite rations for-Spanishand Portuguese imports, credits have been arranged to relieve theimmediate needs off Spain for.wheat and other eosential commodities.Proposals are being put forward to the Portuguese government under which assistance will be given to them in dealing withsurpluses in the Portuguese Colonies provided they restrict re-exports to dangerous destinations.,In the case of Finland, negotiations have continued for anagreement which will permit small quantities of key commoditiesinto that country in return for specific concessions to ourselves,including the right of close inspection carried out by.our.ownofficers.   - The acute need of Sweden for certain key commoditieshas been used as. a basis for negotiations which may &quot;permit .somecargoes to reach Sweden via the North Sea in return for strictregulation, along lines laid down by us, of,Swedish transit tradevia Vladivostok.      Negotiations have   been continued with the swiss, whom we are assisting to maintain some economic and politi-cal Independence while limiting very strictly their capacity tosupply key commodities to the enemy.In the case of these three countries it has been our Objectto maintain sufficient vitality in their economies to make it worth while for the enemy to supply them with small quantities offcommodities In short supply in Europe, such as petroleum products,Balkan agricultural produce and German coal; while avoiding sucheconomic development as would make them economic- assets to the     -enemy.      This policy cannot expect to be completely successful,but by avoiding a purely negative attitude on blockade matterswe increase, the administrative and political difficulties of theenemy while keeping any indirect material, gain.to them at aminimum. .5. -e-OTrs^rrTJcdnnre-Sd-de--e^B^^ie^!^-^^^a-re. $^i^^lln^^5The appointment of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross to direct thecoordination of measures to deal with surpluses reinforces theconstructive side of economic warfare.Reference has already been made to the proposals for dealingwith Portuguese colonial surpluses.      The purchase of.-Brazilian Jcotton and Chilean wool which have been agreed to on trade groundsshould also assist our economic warfare efforts in tho.se countries.The U.administration are taking up.actively the economicsupport off South American countries but have not yet-given any definite answer to our general proposals in regard to the problem- .of surplus production.6. Unoccupied France. ^ -r- -The development of blockade running between colonial? and metropolitan France reached such dangerous proportions that itthreatened not only to open an important avenue of supply for theenemy but also to bring into disrepute the ships&apos; warrant scheme,the collapse off which would have necessitated heavier callsupon/
upon the Navy for blockade purposes,      A few French ships have now been successfully intercepted without incident andit is to be hoped that this can be done more regularly,so that the further growth of this trade may be checked,7* .,!&apos;31ack :hist&apos;&apos; &apos;11 Enemy Export and Contraband Controls.The general work of contraband and enemy export controland blacklisting has continued,      The question of specifyingknown enemy firms in South America, even if they carry the agency for British goods, has been further reconsidered, andmany Spanish and Portuguese firms have been added to the lists.39 fresh and 9 past cases of vessels carrying contraband havebeen considered and 12 ships with a total tonnage of U,87? tonshave been seized.The German and Italian boast that they would break throughthe blockade by the beginning of December and be able to fulfilcontracts to supply exports to South America has been falsified.Firm action has been taken, including; the detention of the brazilian &quot;Sequiera Campos&quot;, carrying. German arms from Lisbon.The delicate political conditions under which detention tookplace early in December made it valuable in strengthening thegeneral position of the blockade.r
