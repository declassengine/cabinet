THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT^Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (R) (40) 209.December 11, 1940.WAR CABINET.REPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER 1940 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES, PROTEC-TORATES  AND MANDATED  TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.1. General Position.THE Defence Agreement between Canada and the United States of America,combined with the proposals for the lease of British bases to the latter, has aroused much speculation about the future relations of the Empire with theUnited States. As regards the Defence Agreement, there has been practically no adverse comment in Canada. Mr. Hanson, Leader of the Opposition, statedbluntly, however, that the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy were Canada&apos;s realguard, and that the defence talks were only window-dressing. .Canada is reported to be &quot; deeply stirred &apos;&apos; by the fortitude of the people ofthe United Kingdom in the face of German air attacks and by the &quot; inspiredleadership &quot; of Mr. Churchill.On the 10th October the Premier of Quebec (Mr. Godbout) made a notablespeech, which has received general approval, in the course of which he said that anyone &apos;&apos; who did not recognise what we all owed to the British Crown, and whodoes not know that it is Britain and Britain alone who to-day is fighting the fight for liberty and Christianity, is a traitor.&quot;Canadian Government policy regarding the negotiations over St. Pierre-Miquelon is not to countenance any hostile action against France, for fear ofantagonising French-Canadian opinion. This is said to be one of real loyalty tothe Crown and of genuine personal affection for the King and Queen. England,which French-Canadians respect, is, however, merely an heroic and activedefender of a great cause. French-Canadians would, without equivocation, fight against France for the defence of Canada. There has recently been a slightdecline in the esteem felt for Marshal Petain as a result of his statement thathe took the responsibility for any agreement with Hitler.The Cardinal-Archbishop of Quebec, in a public address on the22nd November, described the rally of French Canadians to the war effort as thegreatest single blow for Canadian unity in the last twenty-five years, and saidthat French Canadians had shown a true Canadian spirit by their loyalty to theCrown. His address was warmly approved throughout the Dominion.The Free French movement under General de Gaulle has recently had a betterPress.   The outcome of the Dakar expedition was regarded by the Canadian
Press as a genuine disappointment, but not a major reverse, and has been quicklyforgotten.News of the Italian attack on Greece was received with indignation, and ofthe Jervis Bey action with &quot; respectful admiration,&quot; everywhere. The PrimeMinister said that Canada was honoured in having the restoration of Greekfreedom as one of its war aims. The more recent course of the campaign in greece has been received with &quot; relieved surprise,&quot; and is regarded as a seriousreverse for Italy.Mr. de Valera has been much criticised for his attitude over the use of Eireports as naval bases.A Dominion-Provincial conference will be called in January to consider therecent report of a Royal Commission on Dominion and Provincial relations. Itis felt that the adoption of the report will aid the Canadian war effort.The decision of the Canadian Government to appoint Ministers to Braziland the Argentine has been well received.The newly appointed Japanese Minister has announced his intention of doing his best to promote good relations between Japan and Canada.The Canadian Government has accorded recognition to the Czecho-SlovakGovernment in England.Parliament reassembled on the 7th November.2. Naval, Military and Air Activities.Mr. Ralston, Minister of National Defence, and Major-General Crerar,Chief of the General Staff of Canada, are visiting this country to discuss anumber of defence questions.The Royal Canadian Navy has taken over six ex-U.S.A. destroyers, and theCanadian Government has agreed to four of these being placed at the disposalof the Admiralty, H.M.C.S. Margaree (previously H.M.S. Diana) was lost ina collision in mid-Atlantic, and H.M.C.S. Saguenay has been seriously damaged by a torpedo.The two battalions of the 2nd Canadian Division which were in Icelandhave been moved to the United Kingdom; the intention is that the whole of the division should eventually be assembled in this country.Progress with the Empire Air Training Scheme has been maintained, and approximately 5,000 men were in training under the Scheme in Canada at thebeginning of October. At that date Canada had approximately 26,000 officersand men in the Royal Canadian Air Force, of whom 16,000 were employed inconnection with the Scheme. The first batch of air-crew personnel trained inCanada under the Scheme arrived in the United Kingdom at the end ofNovember.The Canadian Government is making arrangements to accommodate certainRoyal Air Force flying training establishments transferred from the UnitedKingdom.   The move of three Schools is already in progress.3. Economic Activities.A Canadian Delegation, headed by the Honourable J. G. Gardiner, Ministerof Agriculture, visited this country in October to discuss the programme for thesupply of foodstuffs from Canada in the second year of war. Owing to exchange and shipping considerations, not all the Canadian requests could be met, but asatisfactory agreement was reached for the supply of essential foodstuffs. Theprogramme as finally settled gives an estimated total of approximately 54 million f.o.b., compared with the purchases of approximately  42^ million during the first year of war. The final figure includes large advance purchases of wheat which had already been made before the discussions opened and whichare estimated to meet our full requirements of Canadian wheat for 1941. these purchases represent, however, but a small proportion of the very large surplus ofwheat with which Canada is faced, and the question of possible future purchasesfor 1942 onwards figured prominently in these discussions. It was decided thatthis question should be left open for the time being, but a full exchange of ideastook place as to the volume and order of price which might be contemplated inrespect of such purchases.
Munitions production on behalf of the Canadian and United kingdom governments is progressing satisfactorily. For example, trucks are being produced for the United Kingdom at the rate of 400 a day. 900 Bren Guns havealready been delivered, and the rate of production will increase by 50 a month from 250 a month; the complete Admiralty order for ten whale-catchers has been delivered, and small arms ammunition production is being steadily increased.Production of the British Mark III Tank, gun carriages and 25-pounder gunsis in progress, while shell-filling plants and explosive plants are in operation.Further capacity is being developed over a wide range of supplies.Mr. Howe, Minister for Munitions and Supplies, is visiting this countrylater this month (December) with some of his officials to discuss supply questions.The recent General Election resulted in a majority for the Government(after providing a Speaker) of one, the state of the Parties being : The Prime Minister entered into negotiations with the two labour opposition Parties and with the Country Party, for collaboration in some formof national government. The Official Labour Party, after considering thecomposite policy submitted by Mr. Menzies as a basis for the formation of aNational Government or National Executive War Council, on either of which theLabour Opposition should have half the seats, refused to take part in anyadministration on these lines, and the collaboration has accordingly taken theform of an Advisory National War Council, presided over by the Prime Minister,of eight members : four being members of the present Government, three of theOfficial Labour Opposition, and one of the Lang-Beasley Labour Group. Mean-while, the Labour Party had expressed its &quot; resolute determination to strengthenAustralia^ war effort.&quot; The formation of the new Council, which met for thefirst time on the 29th October, will no doubt afford some degree of political stability for the time being, but Mr. Menzies&apos; disappointment at the outcome ofthe negotiations is reflected in public opinion as a whole.The Premier of New South Wales said on the 22nd October &quot; We are indeadly peril, and the needs of national defence are so urgent that all must settlepetty party differences and unite. It is deplorable that members of the federal parliament should be unduly delaying unity.&quot;At a recent meeting of the new Advisory War Council a deadlock wasreached over the budget proposals, Labour members insisting that the bulk ofthe increase should be raised on credit through the Commonwealth Bank, ratherthan by taxation. Government members were unwilling to accept this proposal.Apart from this, the relations have been harmonious. The unanimous decisionof the Council to denounce industrial disputes in war time has been well receivedby the public. There is, however, much speculation whether the Government willbe defeated over the budget proposals, though the Prime Minister expects tosurvive. In that event he will drastically control luxury expenditure and consumption, a measure in which he feels he will have full Labour support. The&apos;budget, provides for an estimated expenditure of  A. 274 millions.The Prime Minister drew attention in a speech on Armistice Day to thecomplacent spirit shown by Australians over the war, and reminded them thatthey were &quot; in great peril.&quot;Press comment on the question of naval bases in Eire is that, if Britainfound it possible to open bases in British possessions to American warships, asimilar agreement between the United Kingdom and Eire should be practicable,despite Eire&apos;s neutrality.Greek successes are enthusiastically acclaimed. The attacks on Coventry&apos; and other cities are regarded as a measure of Nazi anger and frustration.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.4.

Harrison, Minister for Trade and Customs.Hon. H. E. Holl, Minister for Labour and National Service.Parliament met again on the 20th November.The Press shows growing interest in suggestions for the revival of an imperial War Cabinet, and also in the possibility of a United States of America-United Kingdom-Australian agreement for naval bases, on the lines of thatrecently concluded regarding bases in the Atlantic.Commenting on the recent Axis pact with Japan, the Minister for external affairs said that the moral for Australians is that they must be content withnothing less than national unity and an all-in war effort, while in a broadcast to japan, Sir John Latham, the Australian Minister Designate, said that Australiastands closely with Britain.5. Naval, Military and Air Activities.The Commonwealth Government sent representatives of the three services to attend the Conference at Singapore which considered the situation in theFar East from the tactical point of view. Arising out of the Conference it hasbeen suggested that an Australian Brigade should be sent to Malaya; thissuggestion is under consideration here.It has been decided that the 7th Australian Division should go to the middle east at an early date. A 9th Australian Division is to be constituted in theMiddle East from the two brigades now in this country reinforced by furtherunits from Australia. It is expected that the training of the 8th AustralianDivision will be sufficiently advanced to enable it to leave Australia, if required,early in 1941. Australian transportation units consisting of four companies anda headquarters group are being sent to the Middle East.The first contingent of Australian pupils under training as members ofair crews arrived in Canada at the end of September to complete their training.6. Economic A activities.Petrol rationing was introduced in Australia on the 1st October.A strong Delegation was sent to the Eastern Group Conference at Delhi,which discussed in October and November the co-ordination of warlike suppliesEast of Suez, and has since reported to the Governments represented.NEW ZEALAND.7. General Position.-Public interest has centred largely on the air raids on English towns; the news of Greek successes; the German talks with the Vichy Government; and onsuch purely domestic issues as the agitation against the present scale of petrol rationing in New Zealand, and in the issue of a new war loan. Events in theFar East have drawn attention to the possibilities, from a defence point ofview, of United States co-operation in the Pacific area, and any evidence ofUnited States interest in Pacific questions is given prominence in the local Press.
New Zealand opinion is not yet fully alive to the gravity of the Axis threatsin the Middle East, but any serious set-back to the British cause in Egypt or elsewhere in that area might, in the opinion of the United Kingdom HighCommissioner, have serious repercussions in the Dominion, if it were felt therethat New Zealand troops had been pitted against an enemy superior in numbers and equipment.Press reviews of the first year of the war have taken the line that Britishstrength is now waxing while German is waning.Mr. de Valera&apos;s attitude towards the provision of naval bases in Eirecontinues to be criticised.New Zealand opinion is that attacks on merchant shipping have not been entirely compensated by naval successes in the Mediterranean and elsewhere.The United Kingdom High Commissioner reports that New Zealanders arecomplacent about the war, though recent shipping losses off the coasts of NewZealand and Australia as a result of enemy action may have done something to counteract this.The Government contemplates the appointment of a New Zealand Ministerto Washington.The announcement of the appointment of Air Chief Marshal Sir Cyril Newallas Governor-General is welcomed, emphasis being placed on the value to NewZealand of his great experience with the Royal Air Force.Mr. G. Holland has been elected Leader of the Opposition in place ofMr. Hamilton, who continues as a member of the non-party War Cabinet.8. Naval, Military and Air Activities.The three New Zealand Chiefs of Staff recently visited Australia and had discussions on defence matters with the Commonwealth Chiefs of Staff. The NewZealand Chiefs of Staff have since attended the defence conference at Singapore.The third echelon of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force has arrived in theMiddle East. New Zealand is providing personnel for a Mechanical EquipmentCompany, which will leave for the Middle East shortly.The move of a New Zealand Brigade Group to Fiji has now been completed.Two batches of New Zealand trained air crew personnel have arrived in theUnited Kingdom for service with the Royal Air Force.9. Economic Activities.The New Zealand Government sent a delegation to the Eastern GroupConference at Delhi.UNION   OF   SOUTH   AFRICA.10. General Position.General Hertzog&apos;s peace motion was defeated in the Union House of assembly by 83 votes to 65. Replying to the debate General Hertzog referredto the Government as &quot; traitors,&quot; and used arguments which the Prime Ministersubsequently characterised as &quot; a glorification of our enemies.&quot;The divisions in the ranks of the Reunited Nationalist Party came to a headon the 7th November, when General Hertzog announced his resignation fromthe leadership of the party, owing to the excision from the party programmeof his clause providing for equal rights for both English- and Afrikaans-speakingpeoples.The cleavage in public opinion on the war issue has become deeper, and thereis a growing tendency towards non-co-operation by the Nationalists with other sections, evidenced by the recent secession of representatives of the DutchReformed Church from the Christian Council, by the increasing intervention of that Church in politics and by the intensified boycotting of non-Afrikaners,and of such organisations as the Red Cross Society. The Opposition have,however, been thrown, at any rate for the moment, into confusion byGeneral Hertzog&apos;s secession. Their pretence of a &quot; United Afrikanerdom &quot; hasbeen shattered and their energies are being dissipated in mutual recrimination.The United Kingdom High Commissioner reports that, whatever the issue ofthe dispute, General Smuts&apos;s position should be greatly strengthened.    His
Afrikaner supporters are less likely than ever to be drawn away by a party whichis falling into the hands of violent extremists; and the openly proclaimed hopes of German victory are bound to alienate more moderate Nationalists.The Prime Minister in a speech on the 20th November referred to the enormous progress which had been made in the industrialisation of the union to meet war needs. He warned the Opposition that the Government would not hesitate to act against organisations such as the Ossewa Brandwag, which were deliberately imitating Nazi methods. Some Government papers demand thatthis organisation and the revived Nationalist Social party should be declaredillegal.The pro-Government Press welcomed the announcement of talks in washington regarding the Pacific and interprets them as a sign that the UnitedStates is prepared to look after the Pacific while Britain is engaged elsewhere.The Opposition Press on the other hand roundly condemns any suggestion that south African naval bases might ever be made available to the United Statesfleet, on the ground that this would drag the Union into American wars.The pro-Government Press has commented in scathing terms on Mr. Pirow&apos;smanifesto about the &quot;New Order&quot; in South Africa, a conception based on national Socialist lines, political power to be in the hands of &apos;&apos; establishedsections &quot; of the people, with a Government independent of a &quot; temporarymajority&quot; in Parliament.Despite these signs of political unrest, Government circles are not alarmed,and view the internal position with equanimity. The Union Minister of Finance,Mr. Hofmeyr, for his part, sees signs of a &quot;New Order&quot; in the &quot;growingunity between the British Commonwealth and the United States of America,&quot;and in the closer links now being forged between the Union and her Northernneighbours.A supplementary budget for war purposes amounting to  32,000,000 was presented by the Minister for Finance. In doing so Mr. Hofmeyr announcedthat, of  51,000,000 which would be needed for the first 19 months of war, only40 per cent, would be borrowed, the remainder being obtained from currentrevenue.All sections of the press have been deeply impressed by the recent Greeksuccesses, and by the British naval action at Taranto. The Opposition pressconcedes the great improvement which has taken place in the British strategicalposition since June.11. Naval, Military and Air Activities.The total strength of the Union forces is now 105,000; 95,000 are on full-time service, of whom 28,000 are in Kenya.General Smuts recently visited East Africa and the Sudan, when he met mr.. Eden. As a result of his visit he has undertaken to send a third UnionBrigade to Kenya and arrangements for the move are in hand.Some 7,000 motor transport vehicles have been sent to the East Africantheatre with considerable numbers of Cape Coloured and Indian personnel asdrivers. Three hundred armoured cars (mainly re-conditioned) were due to beavailable by the end of October, but production was not expected to reach 50 perweek before the beginning of December; the first 400 of these cars are being placed at the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East. The productionof 3-7-inch howitzers is proceeding and output is expected to begin in January.In response to a request by the-Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, general smuts has sent a South African Squadron of Hurricanes, previously in Kenya,to Egypt.A Royal Air Force Liaison Mission was despatched to the Union in October.The Union Government has made arrangements for the accommodation of threeRoyal Air Force flying training establishments transferred from the UnitedKingdom.A South African Air Force operational training unit is being formed in kenya.General Smuts has now offered, in addition to the free services of pilots and air crews of the South African Air Force in Egypt and the Sudan, to release, for secondment to the Royal Air Force, pilots and air crews of the SouthAfrican Air Force who may volunteer for such service, and who are surplus to the requirements of Union operational units.
12. Economic Activities.Legislative action has been taken to secure a stricter control over the exportof capital and the conservation of foreign exchange. Measures have also beentaken to facilitate control over exports for purposes of economic warfare.The Union Government sent a delegation to the Eastern Group Conference atDelhi. Sir Alexander Roger paid a short visit to the Union, to discuss munitionsdevelopments, on his way to India.EIRE.13. General Position.In reply to a statement by the Prime Minister calling attention to thedifficulties encountered in dealing with German attacks upon shipping owing tothe inability to use bases in Eire, Mr. de Valera reiterated his determination tomaintain neutrality and to resist any invasion of Eire from any quarter. this attitude of Mr. de Valera has been severely criticised in the press here and inthe United States, though it appears to have been generally approved in Eire.The last Summary recorded the bombing of villages in County Wexford,which resulted in three deaths. The German Government have now admitted the&apos;&apos; possibility &apos;&apos; that the bombs were dropped by a German aircraft which had lostits way, have expressed regret, and indicated their willingness to pay compen-sation. An Eire Government statement, published on the 19th October, recordsthat another Irish vessel had been attacked and slightly damaged on the17th October by an aircraft alleged to be German, and that the Eire Charged&apos;Affaires in Berlin had been instructed to lodge a protest with the GermanGovernment and to claim compensation.No conclusion has yet been reached in the trade negotiations which began lastApril.NEWFOUNDLAND.14. General Position.After the visit of the representatives of the Canadian Government toNewfoundland, Canada has suggested that the measures already taken by themfor the defence of the Airport and the two seaplane bases should be followedby the taking over of complete control of these bases, including buildings andequipment. The Newfoundland Government have accepted the proposal inprinciple for the duration of the war subject to agreement on certain financialand administrative points.Representatives of the United States of America have visited Newfoundlandto select suitable sites for the grant of naval and air leases. They suggested a naval and supply base at Argentia on the south-west coast, a small naval basewith a separate area inland for quarters at St. Jdhn&apos;s, and an emergency landing-ground near St. George&apos;s on the west coast. These proposals have been accepted,and a letter has been addressed to the United States Navy Department by HisMajesty&apos;s Embassy at Washington agreeing that these areas shall be leased tothe United States on conditions to be embodied later in a formal lease andauthorising the United States to begin work forthwith.Preliminary consideration is being given to various questions regarding civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative arrangements that must arise whenthe terms of the leases are discussed. The United States Government have proposed that an initial United States Garrison should be sent to St. John&apos;sand housed on board a United States ship in St. John&apos;s harbour till accommoda-tion is available, and this proposal has been accepted.With regard to St. Pierre, two representatives of Newfoundland have visited the island to study the position. They have reported that the less Avell-to-doclasses and war veterans are in favour of General de Gaulle, while the administrator, Naval Officers and the more well-to-do classes support Vichy;a considerable section of the population is non-committal. It has been decided not to take any action towards requisitioning the twelve trawlers in St. Pierre.The question of bringing pressure on the Colonial Administration at St. Pierreby withholding financial and economic facilities is under consideration.
The Newfoundland Government have^ decided that, if possible, they willnot ask for financial assistance from the iJnited Kingdom for the remainder ofthe war. In order to give effect to this decision they are making a saving of$550,000 on the expenditure approved in the Estimates. Additional taxationin the form of increases in income tax and death duties, and a 7-J per cent, extraduty on all imports from countries outside the sterling area has also been introduced.The employment position during the summer has shown considerable improvement. The total number of persons on relief in October was 19,298 ascompared with 29,665 in October 1939.15. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.The Royal Navy.The 11th and 12th Contingents (341 men) have arrived in the UnitedKingdom, making a total of 2,147 in all. The 13th Contingent is on its way. the newfoundland Government have offered to supply further men and the admiralty have now asked for a further quota of 1,000 recruits.The Army.His Majesty The King has assumed the Honorary Colonelcy of the 57thNewfoundland Heavy Regiment, R.A. The 6th and 7th Contingents (322 men)have arrived in the United Kingdom, and the two Newfoundland HeavyRegiments, R.A., are now fully manned. Further men are being sent to fillvacancies, due to promotions, &amp;c, as they occur.The Royal Air Force.So far 111 Newfoundlanders have been sent to Air Training Schools inCanada, and 50 ground staff have been brought to the United Kingdom and accepted by the Royal Air Force.16. Economic Activities.Of the loggers who were sent to this country 650 have claimed and obtainedrepatriation on the expiry of their original contracts. There are now about,200 at work in camps in the United Kingdom.At the instance of Canadian and United States naval and military experts,steps are being considered to improve the capacity of the railway to meet defence and other requirements.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.17. Military A activities.The total number of Southern Rhodesians serving with the Army outside theColony is now some 1,300. Two further drafts, each of 50 trained N.C.O.&apos;s, arebeing sent to East Africa for service with the West African Regiments.Southern Rhodesia is forming mechanised units, consisting of a reconnaissanceunit, a 3-7-inch howitzer troop, a field ambulance and a signals platoon. two battalions for local defence are in part-time training.The Southern Rhodesia Minister of Defence recently visited the Union ofSouth Africa to discuss common defence problems, and officers of the Union forces have visited Southern Rhodesia to consider certain technical problems. staff officers from the Middle East Command have visited Southern Rhodesia and theUnion to co-ordinate military plans.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.18. General.Civil disobedience has been continuing and gradually spreading during november. The heavy sentence of four years&apos; imprisonment on Pandit Nehru for anti-war speeches delivered early in October caused some stir in the country.
Mr. Gandhi has decided to extend considerably his anti-war publicity campaignby utilising prominent Congressmen, and some of the ex-minister.rs of the lateCongress Governments are amongst those who have already been arrested.Interest in the movement has consequently been spreading, but there is still no real excitement in most places, though two of the incidents reported have led tosome display of violence. The Government of India have so far continued to dealwith individual cases on their merits under the Defence of India Rules. Theorder under the Defence Rules making illegal any publicity given by the press to the Civil Disobedience Campaign has been withdrawn in response to represen-tations from the press in India, but the latter have been reminded of theirliability for any publication which might be held to offend against the rules, andhave given assurances of voluntary co-operation. The Congress Opposition inthe Central Assembly, who have absented themselves from the Chamber duringthe past year, attended the Budget Session during the month and secured amajority against the Finance Bill.There have been no major disturbances.Contributions towards war funds continued in all provinces.19. Military Affairs.(i) Eighteenth Mountain Battery, Royal Artillery, with mechanical transport, has arrived at Aden.(ii) The move of a force headquarters and two infantry brigade groups from india to Malaya was completed during the month.(iii) The Government of India have agreed to prepare a motor cavalrybrigade equipped with trucks for despatch to the Middle East in February 1941.(iv) The Government of India have agreed to raise two commandos for despatch to the Middle East. One commando is already being raised in theMiddle East from Indian troops already there.20. Foreign and Frontier Relations.(i) A afghanistan.His Majesty&apos;s Minister has received a demand from the Prime Minister forthe cessation of the distribution (except to foreign missions and members of theBritish colony in Kabul) of the Legation bulletin, which has been issued dailysince the beginning of the war, on the ground that it was becoming dangerous and was giving the impression that the Legation was acting as an independentagent against the interests of Afghan neutrality. This bulletin, which, thoughgiving the British point of view, has been made as objective as possible, has been widely appreciated by its recipients as giving a concise statement of the courseof the war. It is valuable as a means of replying to German propaganda, whichis widely spread both through pamphlets and orally through the Germansscattered over the country. The Prime Minister&apos;s ill-considered request was nodoubt based on reports from enemy or anti-British sources, and has played intothe hands of the Germans as evidence of the extent of their influence. TheBritish Minister has had to comply temporarily with the request, but is con-sidering means of restoring the position, and was shortly to have a further discussion with the Afghan Government on the subject of British publicity.Otherwise the situation remains satisfactory. The Greek successes, coupled with the action at Taranto, have been generally welcomed, but some anxiety hasbeen shown as to the possible results of M. Molotov&apos;s visit to Berlin.(ii) North-West Frontier.The Faqir of Ipi has been keeping in the background, but evidence isaccumulating that he is in touch with the Italian Legation in Kabul. In NorthWaziristan hostile groups have been active and several incidents have occurred.On the 8th November a picket of the Devonshire Regiment was ambushed, andon the 20th November road protection troops were attacked, one British officer and two British other ranks being wounded and two British other ranks killed.On the rest of the Frontier and in the settled districts there is nothing ofimportance to report.
(iii) Sinkiang.The latest reports from Kashgar show that the boycott still continues. Anti-British lectures^ were delivered in cinemas and statements made that theConsulate would not remain much longer in Kashgar., The AdministrativeCommissioner has protested about the existence and work of the Consulatedispensary, which has been functioning for the last 40 years, and the Consul-General has had to agree not to admit local residents to medical treatment. Theconditions in Yarkand remain unsatisfactory and the local authorities thereappear to be doing everything possible to force British subjects to leave.21. Economic.(i) Eastern Group Conference.The Eastern Group Conference concluded its deliberations on the25th November, when it adopted a report recommending immediate considera-tion of (a) The establishment in India of a Central Provision Office which wouldbe military in character and under the charge of an Officer appointedby, and under the direct control of, the Imperial General Staff, andwould supply all theatres of war within the Eastern Group.(b) The appointment of a new body, to be called the Eastern Group supply council, which would continue the work of the Conference inco-ordinating supply, planning production and arranging new sources of supply. (It is proposed that the Council be composed of a chairman appointed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom, four members of high standing representing Australia,New Zealand, South Africa and India, and the Military Officer incharge of the Central Provision Office. Eastern Group countries not directly represented on the Council would have the right to sendAdvisers, who would have access to the Council Agenda and beentitled to a hearing, though having no vote.)(c) Substantial additions to the planned programme of production for certainmajor munitions items involving a large programme of new factoryconstruction particularly in South Africa and India and to a lesser degree in Australia and New Zealand.Pending a decision on the proposed establishment of a Supply Council theGovernment of India has agreed, at the request of the Conference, to retain suchportion of the Conference Secretariat as is necessary to keep records, answerenquiries and to take up with participating Governments any recommendationsrequiring further information or immediate action.(ii) Indian Labour.During November a scheme for training Indian engineering workers in thiscountry was worked out, and it is expected that the first batch of fifty or a hundred trainees will arrive here before next March, and that about fiftyadditional workers will start training every month or six weeks thereafter. Thetraining is to take place partly at a training centre and partly at factories. Themen are to live for a month or so at a hostel in order to get used to English customs and afterwards to be lodged with suitable British families. They are not to bepaid wages, but will receive allowances and pocket money adequate for theirexpenses. The immediate object of the scheme is to accelerate munitions pro-duction in India. Another important feature of it is that the men are to begiven full opportunities of learning to understand and appreciate British tradeunion methods and industrial organisation. At the same time arrangements arebeing made to send British instructors to help in the training of engineeringworkers in India. In both these matters India is- much indebted to the Ministerof Labour. The arrangements which are being made under his auspices appearto have met with a large measure of appreciation in India.(iii) Indian Co-operation in the Exercise of Economic Pressure on Japan.The Government of India, together with the Governments of the Dominions,were recently asked whether, in order to give the Japanese Government a foretasteof the inconveniences of economic warfare, bring to their notice the disadvantages of having allied themselves with the Axis, and prevent Japan building up furtherstocks of raw materials which might be used in war against us, they would restrict
their exports to Japan (and also China and Manchuria) of essential goods to normal trade. The Government of India have agreed to this proposal in principle,but in view of the importance attached by the Governments of Australia and canada, as well as by the Government of India, to co-operation in this matter by the United States, the general adoption of this policy throughout the Empirehas been postponed pending the receipt of information as to the attitude of theUnited States Government.Meanwhile, during the last few months, restrictions have been placed for various reasons on the export of many important commodities from India to japan. In May exports of raw jute and jute manufactures were restricted to50 per cent, of the 1939 figures (which were themselves abnormally low) in orderto induce Japan to reach a war trade agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government.They failed in their object, but they are being continued in pursuit of the policydescribed above. Exports of pig iron have been restricted to about 40 per cent,of normal in order to ensure supplies for the United Kingdom. The export of iron and steel scrap to Japan from India was placed under an embargo in themiddle of October in order that India might on this point keep in step with theUnited States. For supply reasons no high grade quality mica may be exported from India except to the United Kingdom, the Dominions, and the United States.Exports of low grade quality mica to Japan are limited to normal trade. In viewof the receipt of information early in October that the Japanese were buying veryabnormal quantities of manganese ore in India, exports were restricted to normal trade. Exports of castor-seed, rape-seed, monazite and ilmenite have also been restricted to normal. These commodities together represent about 20 per cent,by value of India&apos;s normal exports to Japan. The great bulk of the remainder israw cotton. The question of restrictions on the export of raw cotton to Japan is bound up with the possibility of the restriction of imports of cotton piece-goods from Japan into the Empire.  This point is under consideration.22. Finance.(i) Supplementary Budget.The Finance Member introduced a Supplementary Budget in the LegislativeAssembly on the 5th November. Defence expenditure during 1940-41 will, it isestimated, be up by Rs. 14^- crores ( 10f millions) as compared with the originalbudget estimate. The resultant of this and other variations is a prospective deficit of Rs. crores ( 9^ millions) on revenue account, as compared with the budget,which originally just balanced. It is not proposed to meet all of this by newtaxation; but the Supplementary Finance Bill provides for the imposition of a&quot; federal surcharge &quot; of 25 per cent, on income-tax and super-tax, for a similarincrease in the rate of corporation tax, and for certain increases in postal charges. (The effect of imposing a &quot; federal surcharge,&quot; the right to imposewhich is subject to certain safeguards, is that the proceeds go wholly to the Centre,whereas the proceeds of a direct increase in the rates of taxes on income have tobe shared with the Provinces.) The expected yield of these measures in a full year is Rs. 5 crores ( 3f millions) and Rs. 1 crore ( f million) respectively, andthe combined yield during the remainder of 1940-41 is put at Rs. 2 &quot;crores( l-g- millions). The remaining Rs. 10 crores ( 7-J millions) required in thecurrent year will be met by increased issues of Treasury bills for the time being,which will no doubt be funded as opportunity offers. When the SupplementaryFinance Bill came before the Legislative Assembly, to which the Congress party had returned, it was rejected by 55 votes to 53 (the Muslim League membersabstaining). It was again rejected by the same margin when returned to theAssembly with the Governor-GeneraFs recommendation. It was then certified by the Governor-General and laid before the Council of State, when it was passedby 27 votes to 11. Thus it only requires the Governor-GeneraFs assent in orderto become law.(ii) Rupee borrowing.The yield up to the 23rd November of the issues described in the Reports on june and July was as follows : Rs. crores.   millions.3 per cent. Defence Bonds ...       ...        29-8 22-4Interest-free Bonds ...      ...       ...         2-2 1-7Savings Certificates ...     &apos; ;..       ...          1-5 1-1
BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.23. General.No new developments to report.24. Press and Public Opinion.The Press has universally condemned the Italian attack on Greece. British-owned papers hope that, if the Greek successes continue, there may be a Frenchrevival.The Presidential election was much discussed, Mr. Roosevelt being generallysupported.With regard to the Hitler-Molotoff talks, doubt is expressed in the BurmesePress whether the two creeds can be reconciled, and the view has been voicedthat Germany&apos;s difficulties may provide the Soviet with an opportunity fordisseminating Communistic ideals.The Burmese Press has criticised the arrest of Mr. Nehru and the BritishGovernment&apos;s short-sighted policy. The Indian-owned Press urges the BritishGovernment to find a way out of the impasse, warning them against India&apos;sfalling a prey to another foreign Power.The appointment of Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham as commander-in-Chief, Far East, has been welcomed, but fears have been expressed that the grouping of Burma with the Crown Colonies, which is inferred, may affect Burma&apos;s constitutional status.25. Defence.A training course for Europeans called up under the Compulsory ServiceScheme has been started, with a parallel voluntary course for Burmans. Thenumber of Burmans volunteering is satisfactory. Both courses involve threemonths&apos; attachment to a British battalion.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies inthe restricted sense, but also protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)26. Military Affairs.(a) United States Bases.The only Colony where substantial agreement has not yet been reached onthe sites for the United States bases is Trinidad. The present proposal is that an area on the North-West Peninsula should be leased for 99 years as a naval base,and that, at any rate as a temporary arrangement, sites should be made availableto the United States in other parts of the Island for military and air require-s. of s. tel. No. ments.     The   Governor   has  flown   to   Washing-ton   for   discussions   with876 of Dec. 2,      t     j t   j-&quot;u * -1940.        &apos;    Lord Lothian.(b) Bauxite.Owing to the vital urgency of constructing a deep-water wharf in Trinidadfor the transhipment of bauxite from British Guiana, it has been necessary to reserve a site for this wharf out of the area desired by the United States fortheir naval base.In order to protect the bauxite supply in British Guiana it has been decidedto place armed guards on all vessels sailing up and down the Demerara River
ISon this trade. Fixed defences are also being improved, and the O.C. Troops,Trinidad (who is also Inspector-General, Local Forces, for British Guiana), has paid a visit to British Guiana to study this question.(c) Manpower.The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, recently reported that the draftof 50 men from the Ceylon Planters&apos; Rifle Corps, which was sent to the middle east some time ago for enlistment in the Rifle Brigade, was of high quality, andhe enquired whether further drafts were available. The Governor replied that,in view of the fact that 50 men had recently been sent to be officers in the indian army, the Ceylon Planters&apos; Rifle Corps was now slightly below strength, andthat, in view of local defence requirements, the despatch of more drafts to theMiddle East must await further recruitment.(d) Far East.It was recently decided to appoint a Commander-in-Chief. Far East, whowould have under his command the G.O.C., Malaya, the G.O.C., Burma, theG-.O.C, Hong Kong, and the A.O.C., Far East. Air-Chief-Marshal Sir RobertBrooke Popham was selected for this appointment and opened his headquarters at Singapore on the 18th November.The Far Eastern Defence Conference, which, as mentioned in last month&apos;sreport, opened at Singapore in October, concluded its discussions at the end ofthat month and its recommendations are now under examination.(e) Hong Kong.On a number of occasions recently Japanese aircraft have flown over british territory. Particular mention may be made of an occasion on the 26th Novemberwhen Japanese aircraft bombed Sha U Chung on the north shore of Mirs bay and six of the planes passed over British territory near Fanling at a height ofabout 5,000 feet travelling from east to west. Although the violation took placein the middle of the day, the weather and visibility were both bad, and it isprobable that the violation was unintentional, but protests were lodged the same afternoon through the local Japanese Consul-General.27. Disposal of Colonial Products.(a) Bananas.The scheme mentioned in last month&apos;s report for a marketing pool forbananas from Jamaica and a connected scheme for dealing with BritishCameroons bananas have been approved by the Committee on Export Surpluses.Unfortunately it has been found necessary since then to suspend imports ofbananas from all sources for a period of two months in the first instance. Thisis a very severe blow to the principal Colonial producers, Jamaica and the cameroons, although the British Government guarantee of purchase at aminimum price, irrespective of shipment, will mitigate its severity.(b) Ground-nuts.The Treasury have approved the purchase of the Gambia crop by the Ministryof Food at a price of  4* 105. a ton, against  5 in 1939-40, which involves a smallelement of subsidy.(c) Sisal.Arrangements are being put in hand to restrict output in the British east african territories to 100,000 tons (involving a cut of 25 per cent.) in the twelvemonths which began on the 1st November. Negotiations with the netherlands east Indies for an international regulation scheme are making satisfactory progress.(d) Rubber.In order to ensure that there shall be no difficulty in meeting demands forrubber by the United States, the International Rubber Regulation committee decided on the 28th November to raise the quota of release to 100 per cent, for thefirst quarter of 1941 and also to authorise participating Governments to issueexport permits for the 1941 amount at once.S. of 8. tel. toGov., Ceylon,No.659ofNov.8.Gov. tel.

Reports on Particular Colonies.28. West Indies.Sir Frank Stockdale, Controller for Development and Welfare in the west indies, has arrived in Antigua, Leeward Islands, with his Educational and medical Advisers, and is engaged on preliminary investigations. His Inspector-General of Agriculture is also in the West Indies.29. Jamaica.The financial position of the Colony has deteriorated. It is expected thatthere will be a deficit of  119,000 at the end of the current financial year andone of  700,000 at the end of the next financial year. The Governor is asking if his Majesty&apos;s Government will grant Jamaica a loan of  700,000 free of interest for the duration of the war.30. Ceylon.The informal preparatory discussions on outstanding differences between the ceylon Government and the Government of India have broken down. A deadlockwas reached on the matter of the rights and status of Indians in Ceylon. trade questions were not examined, the Government of India holding that there wouldbe no chance of agreement being reached in the absence of a satisfactory arrange-ment on the first matter.31. Hong Kong.(a) Evacuation Scheme.The compulsory evacuation of British European women and children, onlya very small proportion of whom have not left the Colony, has been suspended,s. of s. tel. No. Those already evacuated will not be allowed to return until the political situation642 of Nov. 5.    in the Far East has improved.(b) Immigration restrictions.s. of s. tel. No. The Acting Governor has been instructed, after the views of His Majesty&apos;s644 of Nov. 5.    Ambassador in China had been obtained, that he may proceed with the intro-duction of the Immigration Control Bill, but that it should not pass into lawwithout reference to His Majesty&apos;s Government.(c) Restrictions on petrol export to China.The Acting Governor has asked for instructions on a request received fromthe National Red Cross of China for permission to export up to 70 gallons of petrol for every two tons of medical supplies sent to Hong Kong, for the red cross depot at Kwangsi in order to assist transport of supplies. He is beinginstructed that, in view of the probable Japanese reaction to granting this request,it should be refused.(d) Arrest of Japanese subjects.Hong Kong tel.        Mr. Yamaguchi, the Japanese business man detained in August at HongNo. 706 of Nov. 4. K.ong under Defence Regulations at the same time as other Japanese subjects in other parts of the Empire, was released on the 28th October.(e) Hong Kong University.The British Council has offered  1,000 for the provision of scholarships tobe held at Hong Kong University by students from universities in China.32. Malaya.(a) Financial Contributions.The final contribution for His. Majesty&apos;s Government from the proceeds ofthe Straits Settlements War Loan (see last month&apos;s report) brought the total to approximately  2,500,000.
(b). Food[Reserves.The Malayan authorities continue their efforts to accumulate food reservestores against an emergency. They have purchased a further 15,000 tons of paddyand arranged a scheme of redistribution of food reserves in different areas of the peninsula. It has unfortunately not been possible to maintain the arrangement for the cold storage vessel Cortona to load in Australia for Singapore, where shewas to have remained as a store ship. The Malayan authorities are pressing on with increased provision for cold storage accommodation ashore, but this will,take some months to complete. :(c) Japanese espionage.Mr. Shinozaki&apos;(see previous reports) was found guilty on charges of obtaining information of troop movements and defence dispositions at Singapore andsentenced to three years&apos; imprisonment with a fine of  125.33. Borneo.The Brunei and Sarawak Governments have been asked to declare the Seriaand Miri Oilfields a &quot; protected area,&quot; which would give the local authoritiespower to forbid aliens entering the area or residing there.34. Aden.Economic pressure is being applied to the recalcitrant sections of the tribein the Western Aden Protectorate against which air action had recently to betaken owing to an attack on a Royal Air Force party passing by car through theircountry. A portion of the tribe has submitted, and the presence of GovernmentGuards has enabled the road, which is an important one, to be reopened.The general attitude of the people of both the Colony of Aden and the aden protectorate remains strongly pro-British and hostile to the Italians.35. Palestine.There have been no political developments in Palestine on the Arab sideduring the month. The successful Greek stand against Italian aggression evokedadmiration generally and reduced the fear of Palestine being more directly involved in hostilities either through Italian success in Egypt or penetration in syria. The attitude of Turkey also inspires confidence in the future, at leastamongst the Arabs, though many influential Jews are apprehensive of the resultsof M. Molotov&apos;s visit to Berlin.On the Jewish side the question of the disposal of the illegal immigrants whoarrived in Palestine on the 1st and 3rd November was the principal subject ofinterest for most of the month. A rumour that Government intended to transferthem elsewhere was in circulation soon after their arrival. Jewish organisationslodged strong protests against the proposals attributed to the Government, butthere was little sign of spontaneous public agitation. The official announcement on the 20th November that His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to send thoseillegal immigrants and any subsequently arriving in Palestine to a British colonywas followed by a twelve-hour strike by the Jewish community which was described as neither spontaneous nor wholehearted. Subsequent developmentsarising out of the sinking of the S.S. Patrid in Haifa Harbour on the25th November have already been under the consideration of the War Cabinet.The recruiting of Arabs for the Palestine infantry companies has much improved.   Two companies are complete and a third is nearing completionJewish recruiting is being satisfactorily maintained and the third company is complete.Incidents of violence continue, but on a lesser scale, and are more obviouslyof the nature of mere banditry. There have been instances of successful resistanceby villagers against bandits. The same tendency to oppose lawlessness has helped the police to arrest several outlaws. Considerable damage has been clone to thefrontier fence, but mainly by thieves profiting from the present cessation ofFrench co-operation on the Syrian side.
The situation in Transjordan remains normal, but the recent improvedliaison with French Frontier officers has not been maintained. This appears tohave been due to instructions given by higher French authority.36. Gibraltar.The proposals for the re-evacuation to Jamaica andTrinidad of the Gibraltarevacuees now in London have been temporarily abandoned, partly owing to thedisinclination of the persons themselves to travel overseas, and partly to demands upon transport ships for troop movements and upon&quot; the Navy for other protective duties. The position is to be reviewed early next year.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 11, 1940.
