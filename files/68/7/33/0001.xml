SUPPLIESSupplies available for civilian consumptionare reflecting the low rate of arrivals over recent months, and increased restrictions have beenfound necessary.The main reasons for this are(a) a reduced loadings programme, due torestricted shipping facilities(b) an actual rate of arrival below that programme,due not only to delays and sinkings, butto a failure to implement the loadingsprogramme:(c) serious transport difficulties within this- countryIMPORTprogrammeThe import programme for the second year of war was originally settled at 18.9 million tons.A revised programme of 15.4 million tons hasbeen submitted to the Economic Policy Committee.     Thisrevised programme necessarily imposes drastic reductions on many imports.     The heaviest of these reductionsis in respect of cereal feeding-stuffs for livestock:but several foods for human consumption have had to bereduced, and others excluded entirely.The programme provides for the reduction ofwheat and flour stocks by 500,000 tons by the endof August 1941.ANIMALPROTEIN FOODSIn restricting supplies for human consumption,animal protein foods have been particularly hit:Meat- The ration which on December 16th was reduced from 2/2d per week to l/l0d, willoall for further reduction immediately afterChristmasCheese   - reduced in November to 80^ of pre-war quantities,will be cut to 50% for January.Canned Salmon -   until now available todistributors at 120^2 of normal, is to bereduced to 60^.Bacon -   the 4 oz. ration does not require immediateadjustment, but it is doubtful how long itcan be maintained .
PROTECTIVEPOODSProtective foods are suffering, but to aless degree.Fresh fruit.apart from oranges and lemons, is excluded from the revised importprogrammeTinned fruit. -     cut out entirely.PATSDried Eruits. -being purchased to 75% of theoriginal programme, but arrivals,except for some dates, cannot beexpected before March,Eggs and Egg Productsa - &quot;in permanently short supply and bulk stocks of eggsin shell are pz^actically exhausted.Condensed Milk. -     releases are at 40% of pre-wardatum for full cream sweetened,and 20% for other varietiesMilk Powder. -Liquid Milk.-practically unobtainable for ordinary users, although inthe New Year releases at 23% ofthe pre-war rate may be possible.production in November was the lowest for airy month in the last five years: the degree of restriction, however, has not been serious.      All priority require-ments under the Milk Scheme havebeen met:    sales of School Milkhave even increased:    in many areasit has not been necessary to apply the full 10% restriction expected and the restriction has now beenlifted for the country as a whole.the outlook for these (on whichthe milk supply in part depends)is contingent upon import programme decisions and arrivals.The fats position shows some improvement,although the critical period has not yet passed.Margarine. -   stocks have increased slightly toAnimal Feeds. -Compound lard.  -3-g- weeks supply.the decline in stocks has been arrested at about the same figure,FOODS INADEQUATESUPPLYFoods in adequate supply are:BreadFlourPotatoes (some surplus for cattle feed)
RATIONED COMMODITIESTea - the position is improving and stocksover the critical mid-year period shouldhe sufficient:   but the revised import programme does not permit of de-rationingSugar - position relatively strong:   by theend of January, when the remainder of thehome crop has been processed, total stocks should amount to seme. 700 thousand tons, stored in approximately 1,000 depots.ARRIVALSArrivals in November totalled only 928 thousand tonsagainst October   ...... 1050        &quot; &quot;September ..     ... 134-9        &quot;        &quot;August     ......        1599        &quot;        &quot;Average arrivals, October-January 1081 &quot; &quot;(estimated)SINIgpNGSSinkings in November ...      ... 89,000 tonsagainst October ...     ... 80,000     &quot;September ...... 72,000     &quot;(Refrigerated tonnage sunk   ...     2^- million cubic ft.Additional     ( &quot; &quot;      requisitioned( by Admiralty . &quot; &quot; &quot;       &quot;Psfrigerated tonnage lost throughenemy action ...     15^o of totaldo.       requisitioned .,over 20j      do.
