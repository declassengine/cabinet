(40) 181.)THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.1. General Position.IN addition to the appointment of Mr. Ralston as Minister for NationalDefence, the following Cabinet changes were announced on the 9th July : Minister of National Defence for the Navy:  Mr.  Angus MacDonald(formerly Premier of Nova Scotia). 7Minister for National Defence (Air): Mr. Power.Minister for Finance : Mr. Ilsley.Minister for National Revenue : Mr. C. W. Gibson.Minister for Transport and Public Works : Mr. Car din.Minister for War Services and Agriculture : Mr. Gardiner.The Prime Minister invited the Leader of the Opposition and the formerConservative Minister for National Defence to join the War Cabinet in an advisory capacity.   They have, however, refused.The conscription legislation (the National Resources Mobilisation Actreferred to in the last Report) has been received with calm in the Province ofQuebec. In the Quebec Provincial Legislature it was warmly supported by thePremier and opposed only by Mr. Duplessis.On petition from both Houses of the Canadian Parliament, the UnitedKingdom Parliament, on the 10th July, amended the British North AmericaAct, 1867, to give the Canadian Parliament the power to legislate concerningunemployment insurance throughout the Dominion.The necessary Bill has since been introduced into the Canadian Parliament.2. Naval, Military and Air Activities.The Canadian Government are purchasing from the Admiralty a destroyerto replace H.M.C.S. Fraser, and have asked whether they could buy a seconddestroyer. ,[21651] b   .
It is hoped to concentrate in this country by the end of September the wholeof the Canadian 2nd Division, except one infantry brigade, which will be retained in Canada until it can be replaced there by other trained troops, and one machine-gun battalion, which will be retained in Iceland. Canada is providing20 Forestry Companies, and it is expected that these, after training in Canada;will come to the United Kingdom about the end of September. .The Canadian Government have agreed to the transfer to Canada of thefollowing air training schools from the United Kingdom : 8 Service flying training Schools, 2 Air Observer Schools, 1 Bombing and Gunnery School,1 Torpedo Training School, 1 General Reconnaissance School and 1 air navigation School. The present intention is to transfer about half of these schools to Canada by next December.3. Economic Action.The Ministry of Food recently bought a further 100,000,000 bushels of wheat from Canada for the cereal year 1940-41. This is the largest single purchaseever recorded. Canada&apos;s wheat crop this year is likely to reach the large figureof 400,000,000 bushels. * &quot;Efforts are being made to obtain more aluminium from Canada.      -COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.4. General Position.On the 25th of July the Prime Minister announced that the Cabinet had decided to seek power to extend the life of the Federal Parliament, in order, ifnecessary, to postpone a General Election. Mr. Menzies at first intended to ask the United Kingdom Parliament to legislate, but he dropped this proposal onaccount of opposition by the Leaders of the Country and Labour Parties,and the consequent risk of a refusal by the United Kingdom Parliament to legislate, in the absence of unanimity.A General Election is due before the end of January next.The Leader of the Labour Opposition (Mr. Curtin) was invited by the PrimeMinister to join National Government, but he declined, Mr. Curtin holdingthat the Labour Party can best further the common cause by remaining outsidethe Government.The Labour Opposition have lately been more ready to collaborate in thewar activities of the Government.The coalition between the United Australia. Party and the Country party has provided a Parliamentary majority for the Government, but has not endedfriction between the Leaders of the Parties.Three Commonwealth Cabinet &apos; Ministers (the Vice-President of theExecutive Council and the Ministers for Air and for the Army) and the Chiefof Staff were killed in an aeroplane accident on the 13th August.5. Naval, Military and Air Activities.H.M.A.S. Sydney brought a successful action against two Italian cruisersin the Mediterranean on the 19th July. The first of the two Tribal Class destroyersnow being built in Australia is due to be launched in November.The Commonwealth Government have agreed to send reinforcements andauxiliaries (total 6,000) to join the 2nd Australian Imperial Force in the middle east. They were unable to agree for the present to move a division from australia to Malaya, and do not propose to send further formations from australia until they have considered the views ,of the United Kingdom Govern-ment on the Far Eastern strategical situation. The 7th and 8th Divisions(numbering with reinforcements approximately 85,000) of the 2nd AustralianImperial Force are in training.An additional 250,000 personnel for the defence of Australia are being raised and trained.  Officers and N.C.O.&apos;s required to complete war establishments will
undergo three weeks, and other ranks fifty-eight days&apos; training. This will becarried out between August 1940 and March 1941.; Two squadrons of Hudsons and one squadron of Wirraways of the royal australian Air Force have been sent to Malaya.-   6. Economic Action.Storage of increased stocks of petrol is being arranged in Australia. Thiswill not interfere with the scheme of petrol rationing recently announced by theCommonwealth Government.The Ministry of Food and the Commonwealth authorities are discussing thebulk purchase of Australian butter, cheese and other agricultural commoditiesduring the second year of war. Negotiations on future imports of meat will follow.With the consent of the Governor of the French colony of New Caledonia,the Commonwealth Government are despatching a special representative to the island to develop closer economic relations.NEW ZEALAND.7. General Position.The Opposition have agreed to the formation of the War Cabinet, themembers of which are :- The Prime Minister (the Hon. Peter Fraser);The Minister of Finance (Mr. Nash);The Minister for Defence (Mr. Jones);The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Adam Hamilton); andThe Right Hon. J. G. Coates.The National Council of the New Zealand Federation of Labour and theNational Executive of the New Zealand Labour Party, the one representing theindustrial and the other the political side of New Zealand Labour, are giving full support to the Government.8. Naval, Military and Air Activities.The three New Zealand Chiefs of Staff recently visited Fiji to consult withthe Governor and to report on the defence of the Colony. The Chiefs of Staffrecommended that a Brigade Group should be immediately sent from New zealand to Fiji; this has been endorsed by the New Zealand Government, and the UnitedKingdom Government have agreed (see below).Although they are uneasy at the attitude of Japan and at the fact that wecannot give a definite and early date for the supply of full equipment to their forces in the Middle East, the New Zealand Government have agreed to thedespatch, at an early date, of the 3rd Echelon of the New Zealand Special force to the Middle East.The reinforcements (numbering about 3,000) which were to have sailed withthe 3rd Echelon have, however, been retained in New Zealand to form a brigade group to proceed to Fiji. It has now been agreed that, on the recommendationof the New Zealand Chiefs of Staff and with the approval of the Governor ofFiji, the Brigade Group should be sent at an early date. A field company of engineers will probably be soon sent to prepare accommodation.Up to the end of July 64,000 men had offered to serve with the New ZealandExpeditionary Force. Apart from the training of the Expeditionary Force, theNew Zealand Government plan to provide by the end of April 1941 three months&apos;continuous training for some 30,000 men in the Territorial Force, and 40 days&apos;training per year for 6,000 men of the National Military Reserve of ex-soldiers.[21651] b 2
Three New Zealand transportation companies and two army troops companies of engineers will sail to the Middle East with the 3rd Echelon.Up to the end of July 14,000 applications for entry in the Royal New ZealandAir Force had been received.9. Economic Action.Increased stocks of petrol are being stored in New Zealand.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.10. General Position.There were many stormy scenes during the recent Parliamentary Sessions.The Leaders of the Opposition frequently absented themselves from the House,and their followers showed a violent and obstructive spirit, which only the increasingly serious war position, culminating in the invasion of Holland andthe defeat of France, was able to quell. These events, however, have greatly strengthened the authority of the Prime Minister, and the Governments positionis now regarded as practically unassailable.The Government have set up a sub-Committee of the Cabinet to study &quot;fifth column Activities &quot; in the Union. Drastic steps have been taken to internsuspected persons, and control of the Press has also been tightened up.The Nationalist Opposition, in particular the Afrikaans-speaking section,continues its objection to Union participation in the war, and, since the defeat of France, General Hertzog appears to believe that the war has been, hopelesslylost by the Allies.General Hertzog&apos;s health is reported to be poor, and it is again rumouredthat he will retire.Demonstrations about the Union Governments participation in the war have been linked with criticism of the use by the Government of Native troops,and with demands for a Republic separated from the British Empire. ThePrime Minister is standing firm, and has drawn attention to the fate of countrieswhich trusted in their neutrality, and pointed out that France&apos;s peace would prove &apos;&apos; the peace of death.&apos;&apos;11. Naval, Military and Air Activities.The total strength of the Union forces is now nearly 90,000 of whom 77,000are on full-time service. The Union Brigade Group has arrived in East Africa.In addition to maintaining a fighter squadron of Hurricanes and Furies in Kenya,the Union Government have offered to the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Middle East, a Gladiator squadron, less ground staff, for service in the Sudan.The Union Government have agreed to the transfer from the United kingdom to South Africa of two Air Observer Navigation Schools, one general reconnaissance School, and one Fleet Air Arm Observer School, and have acceptedliability for providing the land required. The Air Ministry are prepared toarrange, if the Union Government so desire, for a limited number of personnel for the South African Air Force to be trained in the transferred schools. Atthe same time the expansion of the South African Air Force training facilities is proceeding on the lines agreed with the Union authorities as a result of therecent visit of Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham. A number ofHurricanes and American type bombers, the latter from a French order in theUnited States of America now taken over by the United Kingdom Government,have been released to the South African Air Force, particularly for the use oftheir squadrons in East Africa. ^In view of the deterioration of the situation in Madagascar, the UnionGovernment have decided not to despatch for the present a small mission to thatisland, as proposed.12. Economic Action.Arrangements are under discussion for the purchase of the whole of the exportable surplus of South African wool for the period of the war and one yearafterwards, on terms similar to those arranged with the Commonwealth ofAustralia and New Zealand.
EIRE.13. General Position.There is little change to report in the political situation in Eire. Therehave been signs of a recrudescence of fear on the part of the Eire authorities thattibis country may take steps to anticipate a German landing by occupying keypoints.   This has led to some deterioration in political relations with Eire.Satisfactory progress appears to have been made by the Eire authorities in raising and training additional defence forces and in taking precautionary measures on lines similar to those adopted in this country for denying to aninvader the unhampered use of roads, aerodromes, petrol supplies, &amp;c.NEWFOUNDLAND.14. General Position.The budget for the Newfoundland financial year beginning on the 1st Julyprovides for a reduced deficit of approximately $1,925,000 as compared with a deficit of $5,735,000 envisaged in the original budget for 1939-40.The Newfoundland Government hope to be able, by increased taxation,reduction in expenditure and local borrowing, to avoid having to ask the UnitedKingdom Government for further appreciable financial assistance for theremainder of the war.The Canadian and Newfoundland Governments, acting conjointly, with thecognisance of the United States of America, have arranged that representatives should visit St. Pierre to discuss with the Administrator questions arising fromthe French collapse.15. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.The 9th Naval Contingent (172 men) have arrived in the United Kingdom,making a total of about 1,600 who have been recruited for the Navy since theoutbreak of the war. A very satisfactory report on the Newfoundlandersemployed on the North Sea Patrol has been received from the Admiralty.The 3rd and 4th Contingents of Army personnel (338 men) have arrived. The5th Contingent is now due to sail.Arrangements have been completed for giving a limited number ofNewfoundlanders initial and advanced air training in Canada as pilots, observersand air gunners.  The first parties for training will start their courses shortly.16. Economic Action.Between 300 and 400 loggers have elected to return to Newfoundland on the expiry of their engagements. The additional 1,000 loggers whom Newfoundlandwas asked in June to provide have arrived or are now en route. The shippingseason for iron ore, pitprops and timber is now at its height.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.17. Military and Air Force Activities.Two new training camps are being established to expedite the full-timetraining of men called up under the Southern Rhodesia National Service Act.The 1st Battalion of the Rhodesian African Regiment commenced trainingtowards the end of July.  The Rhodesia Base Hospital has moved to East Africa.A number of ground personnel for the second Royal Air Force (Rhodesia)Squadron, when formed, have arrived in this country for training.
INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.18. Political Situation.The War Cabinet has been kept, so fully informed during the month of thegeneral political situation in India, in connexion with proposals recently under its consideration, that there is little that I need say in this report. At meetingsheld at the end of the month the All-India Congress Committee confirmed bymajorities the decisions taken earlier by the Working Committee, first, thatMr. Gandhi&apos;s doctrine of non-violence is inapplicable to the defence of Indiaagainst external aggression, and, secondly, that the Congress cannot co-operate with the British Government in the prosecution of defence measures for Indiaexcept on the basis of a previous declaration acknowledging India&apos;s complete independence and of the immediate constitution at the Centre of a provisionalNational Government, such as to command the confidence of the elected membersof the Indian Legislature.19. Military Affairs, July 1940.At the request of His Majesty&apos;s Government the Government of India haveagreed to send : (a) To Somaliland One Mountain Battery.(b) To Aden-One Brigade Signal Section.One Field Ambulance.Certain supply sub-units.All the above are expected to leave India during the first half of August.2. The War Office have intimated that the Animal Transport Company,R.I.A.S.C., serving on the Saar, which was referred to in paragraph 23 (3) of thereport for June, must now be presumed to have been captured by the Germans.20. Foreign and Frontier Relations.(i) Afghanistan. The decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to buy up to,000 tons of Afghan wool subject to agreement as to a reasonable price was accepted by the Afghan Government with gratitude, though the CommerceMinister explained that as there had been considerable delay in coming to adecision he had instructed the various wool companies to sell as best they could toRussia or elsewhere, and he was not sure how much wool was still available. an offer on the part of the Government of India to buy 10,000 tons of Afghan cottonwas also gratefully accepted, and the Government of India are willing to make an advance payment to the Afghan Government with a view to tiding them over their immediate financial difficulties.As regards the  2^- million credit, the Minister of Commerce has suggestedthat it should be allocated as follows : 50 per cent, for the improvementof the main commerce routes, 25 per cent, for agricultural development,particularly construction of canals and barrages, and 25 per cent on industrialdevelopment, particularly the purchase of textile machinery, iron and steel forbuildings, &amp;c. In the matter of the separate credit offered by the Government ofIndia to the Afghan Government for the improvement of roads of strategic importance to India, there has unfortunately been difficulty. The Afghan ForeignMinister informed His Majesty&apos;s Minister that, owing to their fear of arousingRussian suspicion, the Afghan Government could not agree to placing the contracts for the roads in the hands of British or Indian contractors. This isdisappointing, though the Afghan Governments fear of Russia is intelligible, andthe Government of India have felt compelled in the circumstances to recommendthat their offer of credits for roads should be held in suspense. It has also beendecided in accordance with the desire of the Afghan Government to postpone forthe time being further conversations on military matters.
Generally, the situation in Afghanistan has been quiet and the action takenby His Majesty&apos;s Government against the French fleet and the failure of Germanyto launch an immediate attack on Britain have had a steadying effect., But themain preoccupation of the public and of the Afghan Government is with Russiawhose attitude is uncertain. Delays on the part of Russia in signing the trade agreement and resuming certain discussions about the Russo-Afghan frontier havegiven rise to apprehensions that the Soviet Government has far-reaching demands in view for political or economic concessions. It has, however, now been reportedthat the Trade Agreement has been signed without involving any political con-cessions on the part of Afghanistan.(ii) North-West Frontier. The situation on the frontier as a whole has beenquiet throughout the month,; but in Waziristan. there has been one serious outrage,and there is evidence of a general deterioration in the situation during the last fortnight. On the 7th July the Resident in Waziristan, Colonel Campbell, whiledriving his car in the direction of the Razmak, was ambushed by tribesmen hiddenin a culvert. He was wounded, fortunately not seriously, as were both hisorderlies. Eight arrests were made shortly afterwards. In the course of subsequent investigations the local villagers gave the names of persons responsiblefor the ambush, but failed to produce them. Orders were given for the demolition of four fortified towers in two villages near the scene of the occurrence, and a fineof 3,000 rupees was inflicted.The Faqir of Ipi is reported to be planning a new campaign to start next month and to be receiving numerous visitors. He is said to have two Germanswith him and to be receiving funds from enemy agents in Afghanistan. It isreported that he has openly proclaimed himself a follower of Amanullah. At thesame time there have been other signs of increased unrest in Waziristan.(iii) Sinkiang. Further demands couched in discourteous language havebeen received for the closing down of the Consul-GeneraPs Wireless Station atKashgar from the Administrative Commissioner, who claims to be acting on instructions from the Sinkiang Provincial Government. He accuses the Consul-General of &apos;&apos; holding in contempt the sovereignty of my country and disregardingrelations between our countries.&quot; The Consul-General has been instructed to reply that he is at a loss to reconcile this claim to sovereign power with thefrequent asseverations of the Provincial Government that they recognise the sovereignty of the Chinese Central Government, who have given instructions thatthe Wireless Station should be allowed to remain open. He has further been told to maintain his refusal to comply with this demand unless a forcible irruptioninto the Consulate is imminent.(iv) Persian Gulf. The main interest in Koweit and Muscat has been centredin the possible invasion of Britain. The sympathies of all Arabs in Muscat arewith Britain in her lone stand. There is a good deal of anti-Italian feeling inKoweit, and in Muscat it is considered that Italy is heading for disaster.(v) French Settlements in India.- The position since the French armistice isnot unsatisfactory. Towards the end of June the message addressed by HisMajesty&apos;s Government to French Colonial Governors, inviting their continued co-operation in the war and announcing His Majesty&apos;s Governments intentionto maintain the integrity and economic stability of French overseas territoriesif they stood by us, was communicated to M. Bonvin, Governor of the FrenchSettlements in India, who assured His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General that he was entirely on the side of the British Government and proposed to have no relationswith the Bordeaux Government. Messages from General de Gaulle have beentransmitted through our Consul-General to M. Bonvin, who has recently sent a reply assuring him of whole-hearted co-operation.To prevent any serious deterioration in the economic situation in Pondicherryand Karikal the Government of India think it desirable to bring the FrenchSettlements into the economic orbit of British India and are about to initiatediscussions with M. Bonvin for a customs union between French and british territories in India.21. Indian States.-     No important political developments have been reported.As a result of the decision to expand the Forces on the Indian establishment,States which maintain Forces capable of immediate embodiment with the Forcesof the Crown have been warned to hold these in readiness to proceed on service
outside State territory. The Defence Department have also called for19 additional units of Indian States Forces to be brought up to effective strengthwith a view to embodiment.Several further notable war contributions have been made by Indian Rulers.The Nizam of Hyderabad has presented the Viceroy with a sum from his personalrevenue sufficient to purchase a flight of American Fighter aircraft for India.The Maharaja of Gondal has presented  7,500 for use by the Ministry of health in connection with evacuated poor children, and the Maharaja of Bikaner, besidesoffering to raise additional troops for service with the Forces of the Crown, has promised  15,000 towards purchase of aircraft in this country. Owing topostponement of the Government scheme for evacuating children overseas, ithas not been possible to utilise at present a sum of  7,500 presented by the Nawabof Bahawalpur to assist this scheme.22. Economic.Recent supplies from India.Considerable orders for textiles for the United Kingdom have been placedin India within the past two months. The Chemical Defence ExperimentalStation approved the samples of the new material Cotton/Jute Union Fabricas suitable for anti-gas capes, and an order has been placed for three million yards of this material. One million yards of Tossa Jute Canvas has been orderedfor the Passive Air Defence Department, and the Railway Executive StoresCommittee, who are faced with a shortage of flax canvas, have placed orders forone million yards of Tossa jute Canvas, and one million yards of cotton canvas.The Committee has also asked for a 100 yards sample of cotton jute unioncanvas for experimental purposes, and this is now on its way. A large orderamounting to six million lbs. of five-fold cotton yarn for webbing production has been sent to India, and the War Office have ordered 30,000 tents (160 lbs.).The Ministry of Supply have agreed to take over for this country thecarbonised coconut shell which had been ordered for the French Government.One cargo which was on its way when the French collapse occurred has now arrived in this country.Co-ordination and expansion of supplies East of Suez.Arising out of the entry of Italy into the war and the collapse of France,the problem of the co-ordination and expansion of the munitions, warlike stores and equipment in British countries East of Suez has been under active considera-tion. India, in view of its geographical position and its varied and extensiveresources, is the natural centre of this co-ordinating effort, and the Viceroy, inconsultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, has beeninvestigating the possibility of establishing close liaison between India, theCommonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, SouthernRhodesia, Burma, Malaya, Hong Kong, Ceylon, and the African Territoriesrepresented in the East African Governors&apos; Conference, for the purpose of ensuring that the best possible use is made of their resources, existing and potential, for the purposes of the war. Invitations have recently been issued tothe Governments concerned to a conference to be held in India towards the endof October. It is hoped that the Conference will enable the participating Govern-ments to settle a joint policy for the co-ordination and development of their resources for the purposes of the war, and to establish some form of permanentliaison arrangement with that object in view.Economic effect of stoppage of Exports to Continental Europe.India, in common with other territories which are large producers of rawmaterials, will suffer seriously from the stoppage of exports to Continental Europeimposed by developments in the war situation. Exports are now almost entirelyimpossible to every country on the Continent, except Spain, Portugal and Turkey,with which a limited trade can still be conducted. India&apos;s normal peacetimeexports to the markets which are thus shut off totalled in value Rs. 35-^ crores( 26,625,000) per annum or 19-8 per cent, by value of India&apos;s total normalexports to all destinations. But the position is more serious than this percentagewould indicate, because the reduction in exports falls mainly on India&apos;s principalraw material products.    The following are the quantities of India&apos;s more
important exports which normally go each year to Continental Europe, togetherwith the percentage which these quantities bear to India&apos;s total exports to alldestinations of the commodities in question : (1) Hemp    ...       ...........        25,641 tons or 63-7%(2) Oilseeds(3) Raw Jute(4) Hides and Skins(5) Manganese Ore(6) Oilcakes(7) Tanning Substances(8) Raw Cotton(9) Wheat......(10) Lac       ......642,587 tons or 59%388,571 tons or 51-6%20,507 tons or 43-2%248,050 tons or 34-9%126,389 tons or 33-5%19,177 tons or 25-7%148,662 tons or 25-6%80,640 tons or 24-9%7,859 tons or 22%In the case of some of these commodities (e.g., manganese ore) there may beincreased markets in the United States which would in part counterbalance theloss of markets in Continental Europe and steps are being taken to look forincreased outlets in America generally. In some cases there will, subject to theshipping situation, be increased exports to the United Kingdom. The above listincludes all India&apos;s principal raw material products, and it is clear that, exceptin so far as remedies can be devised, distress is likely to occur among the classes in India engaged in their production and export. The same problem arises inrespect of the disposal of the raw material products of the Americas and otherparts of the world rendered surplus by the cutting off of the markets of continental Europe, and the proposal submitted to the Havana Conference for joint action in the matter by the Governments there represented to deal with theproblem as it affects them by marketing arrangements and loans to producers isof much interest in this connection.24. Finance.Registration of dollar securities.The Government of India have called for a return of all securities in respectof which the principal and interest or dividends are payable in United Statesdollars. This measure is designed to facilitate the requisitioning (by compulsory purchase) of such securities, if later deemed advisable.Safety of gold reserves.The gold held as part of the Indian note issue reserve has for many yearsincluded a certain quantity (about 506,000 fine ounces, worth rather more than 4 million at the present market value) held in London. As a measure of precau-tion, this gold has now been transferred from London to India. The transferhas been effected, without incurring the risks of actual shipment, by means of an exchange with the Treasury, who at the time held a stock of gold in India.Rupee BorrowingIt was announced on the 25th July that the Government of India were placingon tap an issue of 3 per cent. Defence Bonds issued at par and repayable in  years&apos; time at 101. A similar issue had previously been open to smallerinvestors, a limit of Rs. 15,000 ( =  1,125) being set to individual holdings. Thenew issue is of a general character, no such limit being set. The effect of this issue should be to assist both in raising the necessary funds for the enhanceddefence expenditure of the Government of India and in drawing off any surpluspurchasing power, and thus counteracting possible inflationary tendencies.New Forms of Currency.It was foreseen some time ago that there was likely to be a greatly increased demand for currency in circulation in India. The Government of India possessa large stock of silver bullion. On the other hand, there is a pretty continuousdemand in India for silver bullion, and in the circumstances contemplated thiswould be likely to be intensified. It would be necessary to ensure that such ademand was met, since otherwise the price of silver would keep on rising untilthe silver rupee became worth more as metal than as a coin, and the bulk of[21651] &apos; c
India&apos;s metallic circulation would be liable to disappear into the melting-pot.The demand for silver could be met either by importation or from the Govern-ment stocks. Importation would have to be largely from American sources andwould involve the frittering away of some of the Empire&apos;s valuable dollar resources. In order to minimise the risk of this, it was necessary to take steps which would have the effect pf making the Government stocks of silver availableto the greatest extent possible for meeting the bullion demand, and for thispurpose to endeavour to meet the currency requirements in other ways.Preparations with this end in view have been taking place for a considerable time, and within the last few days two measures have been announced : One isthe issue of one rupee notes to supplement the silver circulation. It will be recalled that there was similarly an issue of one rupee notes in 1917 and thatthey continued to be issued for several years after the end of the last war. the initial issue has been in the form of George V notes, of which a considerablestock was prepared at the time of the silver crisis of 1935, but did not actuallyrequire to be issued then. The other measure is the issue of half-rupee coin in500-fine silver. This is the same fineness (and incidentally the same quaternaryalloy is being used) as that of the United Kingdom silver coinage. A quarter-rupeecoin of this fineness was introduced into India a few months ago. Hitherto thefineness of all the Indian silver coinage, including the rupee itself, was 916(i.e., ll/12ths silver). Each of these measures has required legislation, whichhas been enacted by Ordinance.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.25. General.The reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Burma Ministry&apos;s statementof policy (W.P. (G.) (40) 162) was broadcast by the Governor on the 2nd July.Soon after the broadcast he announced that he had selected U Maung Gyee, whohas been President of the Senate since the inception of the new Constitution in1935, as his third Counsellor. U Maung Gyee was for some time Minister ofEducation under the old Constitution and was a member of the Burma RoundTable Conference. Partly because he believes a period of military training is good for every young man, and partly because he thinks all Burmans should be trained to defend their country, he has been a consistent advocate of conscription.Throughout Burma the situation is reported to be generally peaceful.Meetings sponsored by the &quot;Freedom Bloc&quot; on the 11th and 18th Julywere not well attended. This extreme-nationalist group aims at breaking-down the Constitution by non-co-operation and boycott and the attainment of&quot; independence&quot; on its own terms. Its leader is the former Premier, Dr. Ba Maw.On the 12th July he delivered an actionable speech at Mandalay to his followers,who declared him their &quot; Dictator,&quot; supporting his programme for refusingall help from Burma, either with men or money, to the prosecution of the warand for setting up a rival Legislature to draw up a constitution for Burma.On the 29th July Dr. Ba Maw resigned his seat in the Legislature, on the groundthat he could better work for Burma&apos;s freedom outside; and on the 31st theMinisters decided to take action against him for his speech at Mandalay onthe 12th July. The Governor does not expect that the reactions to this will lead to any serious disturbances, though attempts to make political capital out ofthe arrest of the former Premier are to be anticipated.Dr. Thein Maung, a former Minister, also was arrested on the 26th July,and is to be prosecuted, at the instance of the Ministry, for making a seditiousspeech,.26. Press and Public Opinion.The general public reaction to war developments in Europe has not changed since June. As regards the Burma-Yunnan Road, while the press welcomed theprospect of a settlement between China and Japan, opinion as a whole is hardening
in favour of China, although the dangers of Japanese expansion southwards arerecognised. The local Chinese community was, naturally, much disappointed bythe agreement to restrict the use of the Burma road.Local arrangements have been made for broadcasts on war subjects byprominent people, to counter enemy propaganda. British propaganda is statedto be satisfactory. Arrangements are in progress for the inclusion in the B.B.C.Empire broadcast of an occasional talk in Burmese by selected Burmans inIndia.27. Defence.Measures are proceeding for strengthening local defences, but they are considerably hampered by lack of supplies from the United Kingdom.28. External Relations.Nothing to report.29. Economic.It is reported that a small increase in the cost of living has not led to anygeneral demand for an increase in wages.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this Report &quot; Colonies&quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)30. Military Affairs.There is very little to report this month under this head.Fiji.The New Zealand Chiefs of Staff made a short visit to Fiji, and have made certain recommendations to the New Zealand Government for the improveddefence of the Colony.Mauritius.Consideration has been given to the question of the defence of Mauritiusin the light of the collapse of France and possible Japanese hostility. It hasbeen decided that there is no need to increase the present scale of attack onMauritius or present scale of defences, but attention is being paid to certaindefects in the mounting of the present 6-inch coast defence guns.The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, has recommended raising one company auxiliary military pioneer corps, and one Artisan R.E. Company for service in the Middle East. The Government of Mauritius is prepared to proceed at once with the formation of such units.British Guiana.Consideration has been given to the improvement of the defences of theColony from the point of view of protecting the bauxite supplies. One 3-7-inchgun is being installed, and two 12-pounders for river-going ships.An Order in Council is being made under the Visiting Forces (British Secretary of commonwealth) Act, 1933, applying the provisions of the Act to all Colonies, state&apos;sProtectorates and Mandated Territories.   There are already Dominion troops Governor ^present in Jamaica, Bermuda, East Africa, Palestine and Malaya.GovernorstelegramNo. 218, Secret,of July 28,1940.Secretary ofState &apos;telegram to governor,No. 154, Secret,of July 25,1940.31. Situation in the French Colonies.Our first aim on the collapse of. France was to induce the French colonies to fight on as our allies.  Particularly in West and Central Africa, close contact[21651] c 2No. 263, Secret,of July 25,1940.
was established with the local French administrations, who were offeredsubstantial economic and financial inducements. It is clear that there were andare considerable French elements reluctant to accept the armistice. But during july official opinion has hardened against us. This has been due first to the navalactions at Oran and Dakar, after which the French authorities broke off officialrelations, and, secondly, to the action of the Vichy Government, who are, ofcourse, in a position to exercise strong pressure on French officials overseas, andwho have recently taken measures to enforce on the latter an official policy ofobedience to Vichy and non-co-operation with us. There are signs that the Frenchlocal authorities in some areas have accepted this policy somewhat against theirwill, and there is a widespread desire to maintain economic relations with GreatBritain. As it would be the French colonies which would suffer severely from the;cessation of trade relations, this puts us in a strong position to exercise pressure on them; but, although the prospects in this line are promising, the policy is along-term one. Towards the end of the month there have been signs thatdissentient elements in French Africa are beginning to organise themselves, anda movement has been formed in the Cameroons- in support of General de Gaulle.The above general observations apply to the remainder of the French overseas possesions, all of which seem to have accepted the armistice. The FrenchWestern Pacific Dependencies are the only exception; the local authorities beganby repudiating the Vichy Government, but even here there have recently been signs that the latter are attempting to resume control.32. Exchange Control and Export and Import Licensing.Instructions were issued to Colonial Governments as a result of whichapplications to export to neutral countries in Europe can once more be entertained. They have, however, in all cases to be referred to the Secretary ofState, and cannot be granted without his concurrence, which is not, of course,given without the agreement of the Minister of Economic Warfare. instructions have also been sent to Colonial Governments with a view to initiating the ShipNavicert system.The further measures of exchange control recently adopted in this country,relating particularly to the limitation of dealings in free sterling, have been followed by corresponding action in the Colonial Empire.33. Supply of Colonial Products.The general question of disposal of Colonial products, of which there areexcess supplies owing to wartime developments, has continued to receiveattention, and the Colonial Office is taking part in the work of the ministerial committee which has now been set up to consider this problem.The negotiations for bulk purchases by the United States Government of rubber and tin were successfully concluded, and the agreements have come intooperation during the last month. Further proposals for additional purchases havebeen suggested from the American side, and discussions on these are now proceeding. The present agreements provide for the purchase of 150,000 tons of rubber, which is not likely to be completed before next spring, an d 75,000 tonsof tin, which is not likely to be completed for at least twelve months. TheInternational Rubber Regulation Committee and the International TinCommittee have agreed to do everything necessary to maintain production at thehighest practicable levels, and the international quotas have been fixed at 85 percent, for rubber and 130 per cent, for tin.34. Maintenance of Supplies to Colonial Dependencies.*The problem of securing the maintenance of essential supplies toDependencies in the Mediterranean continues to occupy the attention of myDepartment, and shipments of supplies for civil purposes are being arranged inclose consultation with the Ministry of Shipping and the Service Departments.Measures are also now being urgently examined for increasing the food reserves in Malaya as a result of the new situation caused by the loss to us of the French* To be substituted for Section 38 on Shipping in last month&apos;s report.
Reports on Particular Colonies.36. East Africa.In order to secure more effective co-ordination of information and to ensurethe best use of the resources in the main war effort of the East AfricanDependencies, the Conference of East African Governors has been reconstituted.The Governor of Kenya has become the permanent Chairman of the Conferenceand Sir Philip Mitchell, K.C.M.G., M.C., permanent Deputy Chairman. On hisnew appointment Sir Philip Mitchell relinquished the Governorship of Uganda,He now resides at Nairobi, and, in addition to being in general charge of theConference, he is responsible for planning in advance and co-ordinating the war effort of the East African Dependencies as a whole. He is available to establish and maintain personal contacts with the Governments of territories outside EastAfrica and in conversations and correspondence with them is empowered to speak on behalf of the Governors&apos; Conference territories, namely, Kenya, Uganda,Tanganyika Territory, Zanzibar, Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia.The Honourable Sir Charles C. F. Dundas, K.C.M.G., O.B.E., Governor ofthe Bahamas, succeeds Sir Philip Mitchell in the Governorship of Uganda.Legislation providing for compulsory national service on the lines mentionedin the June Report has now been introduced in the Tanganyika Territory.37. Ceylon.Indo-Ceylon Relations and Indian Immigration.There is now some hope that informal discussions will take place in the nearfuture between representatives of the Ceylon Government and the Governmentof India. A proposal to this effect has been forwarded to the Government ofIndia by the Ceylon Government, and the date suggested is September. If thesepreliminary discussions take place it is hoped that they will&apos;lead to the conveningof a formal conference between the two Governments which would aim at thesettlement of all outstanding questions between the two Governments.38. Aden.Frontier Negotiations with the Yemen.These negotiations have broken down. The King of the Yemen pressed hisdemands for the cession to the Yemen not only of Shabwa and Al Abr but of alarge area surrounding these two places and an extensive area more to the East.Governorstelegram toSecretary ofState, No. 441of July 16,1940.fleet. The principal difficulty is that of storing food-stuffs, particularly rice, onwhich the bulk of the population depends, for a sufficiently long period in the climate of Malaya.A considerable volume of protest has been received from exporters of brandedfood products in this country against restrictions imposed by Colonial Govern-ments on imports of food-stuffs from the United Kingdom. These restrictions were imposed in the interests of conserving food supplies in this country and reducing congestion at United Kingdom ports. The advantages likely to be derived from a drastic reduction of this trade have to be weighed against the sacrifice of markets and the desirability of asking Colonial Governments to relaxthese restrictions is now being considered in consultation with the Board of Tradeand the Ministry of Food.35. Contributions by Colonies to the War Effort.In reply to a question in the House of Commons on the 24th July, the Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary of State circulated in the Official Report a list givingdetails of monetary and other gifts made by Colonial Governments, native rulers,various bodies and individuals in the Colonial Empire to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment for the prosecution of the war and to various organisations for war purposes.The cash gifts to His Majesty&apos;s Government alone in this list amounted to morethan  7^ million, and in addition  1,157,000 was lent free of interest for the duration of the war.   Gifts in cash and in kind are still being received.
i The cession of these areas to the Yemen would be undesirable on strategic grounds and would conflict with our obligations to the Qu&apos;aiti Sultan. After full con-sideration, therefore, the British negotiator has been instructed to withdraw from Sana&apos;a after informing the Imam that His Majesty&apos;s Government are willing to resume negotiations at any time on the basis of the &apos; - neutralisation &apos;&apos;of the two areas in dispute.39. Malaya.Labour Unrest.The measures taken by the Government to deal with the strikes in rubberfactories in Singapore, referred to in last month&apos;s report, proved generallysuccessful and the situation in the industry has returned to normal.United Kingdom-Japan Agreement on Supplies to China.In order to allay possible disquiet among the large Chinese population arisingout of the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to close the Burma Roadtemporarily to the export of war materials to China, the Acting Governor gave a local broadcast to prepare the Chinese community for the decision. This receivedconsiderable publicity in the World Press. The broadcast satisfactorily achievedits local object.40. Hong Kong.The evacuation of women and children from the Colony referred to in lastmonth&apos;s report has been carried out, in the first instance to Manila, from wherethey are being transferred to Australia.The position vis-a-vis Japan continued to overshadow affairs in the Colony.The agreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Japanese Governmentrelating to the supply of war materials to China from Hong Kong and Burmarequires that none of the commodities specified as having a military value to china shall be exported from Hong Kong. The more specific war materials inthe list had in fact been prohibited for export to China from Hong Kong forsome time past. The conclusion of the agreement was not followed by anydisturbance among local Chinese.41. Gibraltar.Owing to the attitude of the French authorities in French Morocco it became necessary to remove the civilian population of Gibraltar numbering some 13,000persons who were evacuated from Gibraltar to French Morocco about six weeks ago. These people were sent back to Gibraltar temporarily and efforts were madeto arrange for their re-evacuation to parts of the British Empire other than theUnited Kingdom. It proved impossible, however, to send them elsewhere at suchshort notice. With the co-operation of the Portuguese Government 2,000 ofthem are being sent to Madeira. The remaining 11,000 are coming to this countrytemporarily. It is contemplated that these 11,000 will be re-evacuated toMauritius, Jamaica and other colonies in the course of the next four months.42. Malta.The reports which have been received from the Malta Government regardingthe morale of the civilian population under continual air attack remain generally satisfactory. Steps are being taken by broadcasts in the Maltese language andother publicity in this country which will be transmitted to Malta, and by thedespatch of films and other material to the Island, to keep the civil population in good heart.43. Cyprus.The political situation in Cyprus, which was beginning to give some cause for anxiety, has become more satisfactory since the entry of Italy into the war.There has always been a strong anti-Italian feeling in Cyprus, and publicsentiment and morale have been strengthened and consolidated by the appearance of Italy as an open enemy.
44. Palestine and Transjordan.During the present month there has been a relaxation of tension and somerestoration of confidence among both the Arab and Jewish communities.Political interest has been almost exclusively focussed on events in Syria andto a less degree Egypt. British naval successes in the Mediterranean, and inparticular the sinking of the Bartolomeo Colleoni, have had a reassuring effect.Successful R.A.F. attacks on Libya have also impressed the public, although theBritish withdrawal from Kassala and Moyale aroused some apprehension in Arabcircles. Contempt for the Italians and an exaggerated idea of the strength ofthe British Forces in the Middle East tends to make local successes of the enemyseem more important than they are.The decision of the French in Syria to throw in their lot with the PetainGovernment came as a highly unpleasant shock, and a considerable number, bothArabs and Jews, now criticise what they affect to regard as the British failure to take the opportunity of occupying Syria and Lebanon. The main localpreoccupation is, however, concerned with the future economic relations betweenPalestine and Syria, as present restrictions on trade have caused financial loss.The murder of Dr. Shahbandar was interpreted by many as a presage of a dissolution of the French authority in Syria and a prelude to a revival of a campaign of terrorism which would spread to Palestine.. This prospect causedsome perturbation amongst Arab parties opposed to Ffaj Amin. Jewish circlesare still responsible for alarmist rumours of Arab preparations for reneweddisturbances. This propaganda is no doubt still connected with Jewish demands for the creation of a Jewish Military Force in Palestine.The latest recruiting campaign has been popular amongst the Jews especially for service in the Royal Air Force and Jewish leaders have given usefulco-operation. Arabs have been less eager to enlist but have given more openexpression to their support of and loyalty to the British cause.The security situation remains quiet although there has been a slight increasein local brigandage.The two Italian air raids on Haifa have brought the realities of war to palestine. On both occasions the behaviour of the local population was excellentand the air raid precaution organisation operated efficiently. There is a growingcriticism of the non-existence of fighter aircraft or of mechanical devices to enablesome warning to be given of impending raids.Quarrels continue in Jewish political organisations and, althoughMr. Rutenberg has succeeded in reducing the membership of the Vaad Leumifrom eighteen to eleven, the resultant body is still unwieldy and divided byparty jealousies. There are also divisions in the Revisionist party, and the resultmay be a relapse from its present moderation towards the extremist tacticspreviously followed by certain members of the party.Transjordan is normal.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,August 17, 1940.
