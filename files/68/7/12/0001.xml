South Wales, little of which can betransferred to-other areas.     In the national interest this shouldbe made available for other employment, either in munitions or inthe fighting forces by a concentration of labour on the more efficient pits (or parts of pits) and the closing of others.Steps must, however, be taken to keep these pits available for post-war needs and proposals have been laid before the colliery owners-.     Discussions are actively proceeding.
LABOUR IN THE - DISTRIBUTIVE TRADE.In the distributive coal trade there is a growing shortage oflabour and the Minister of Labour has agreed to a further and final deferment until the 31st October of the calling-up of essential workers.HOUSE COAL SUPPLIES.The heavy demand for house coal for stocking continuesand tends to create temporary shortages in the Southern counties.The Department have instructed the Midland (Amalgamated) district to cut local deliveries during the next six weeks by 10^, and thereby release an additional 150,000 tons for the relief of theweak spots.STOCKING.Distributed Stocks.31 st August. 19*1-0.     31st July, 19*1-0.Tons.

-3-T BRCHAHTSt STOCKS.Hitherto the heavy demand of consumers for stocking has givenmerchants little opportunity of stocking, hut there are signs of approaching saturation in consumers&apos;  stocks and if transport ismaintained the merchants should soon he able to fill up theirown accommodation.GOVBRiMKSITT STOCKS.The same consideration applies to Government stocksSites at present available      18Capacity) mostly inj Southern England2,000,000 tons) especially near) London.Coal stocked up to date230,000tonsEXPORTSAmple supplies of coal suitable for the remaining export markets are available in South Wales but unfortunately shippingprogrammes require large quantities to be taken from theNorth East coast where there is at present a shortage oflarge screened Northumberland coal, owing to the heavy demandsof the inland   markets,,      It. was necessary recently to cancel aconsiderable number of trains in the Department5 s emergencyprogramme for home supplies to meet the prior claim of export.Shipments to the Argentine have been running substantially below that country&apos;s requirements.      Portugal&apos;s needs have been met in full,      Spain is taking increased quantities of coal, butthe problem of developing exports in that direction is complicated by the refusal of the Spanish Government to put any of its ownboats into the trade.      No coal has been sent to Egypt from thiscountry since July in view of the situation in the Mediterranean,and the Egyptian supplies will soon be dangerously low.Coal Exports (including Foreign Bunkers)JLj uneJulyWe ektttt!tSIendedStitIISt3rd Augu st10 th     &quot;17 th     &quot;24th31stttst(prov.)August (five weeks&apos; total)1940.Tons.,2,798,3921,881,927265,900290,500326,000278,300. .21.4,600.1,375,3001939.Tons.4,565,0204,607,793986,700755,700725,400762,500_645o7003,876,000*   Includes a large tonnage of coal consigned to France andsubsequently brought back to the United Kingdom orre-shipped to other markets.
