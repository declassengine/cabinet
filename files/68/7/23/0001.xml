MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC. WARFARE.Report on Action taken for the period October1st to 31st, 19b0oDuri)Og the period covered by this Report Italy has attackedGreece and this has entailed a revision of the policy of the M.E.W.with regard to that country.     The pressure which is being exertedhy Germany on the Balkan countries has also considerably increased and it now appears unlikely that much progress can be made witheconomic warfare purchases in Roumania, Yugoslavia or Bulgaria,Turkey on the other hand continues to offer a promising field forthe activities of the U.K.C.C.  and every effort is being made todevelop them,     Discussions with regard to supplies for Switzerland,Spain and Portugal continue as well as the barter negotiation withRussia.2.        Owing to the Presidential Election, little progress hasbeen possible in negotiations with U.S.A: but informal conversationshave been pursued with a view to securing the extension of the IT. S.export licensing controls (particularly as regards shipments to theFar East) and the joint examination of the problem of surpluscommodities.     The visit of Lord Lothian to this country has enabled a useful exchange of views between the Ministry and him onthese questions as well as on the general policy of the blockade and the improvement of our publicity in the U.S.A.3.       With regard to the problem of export surpluses provi-sional proposals have been submitted to the State Department but have as yet elicited only a non-commital reply.     Meanwhile themore urgent cases have been dealt with along lines that do not conflict with the basic principles laid down by the ministerial committee,1+.       Following a conference with representatives of the free french movement at M.E.W.,  the Governors of the Free Frenchterritories have now been asked to organise a system identical with that existing in the British and Belgian Colonial Empire for controlling exports in the interests of the blockade.    The direc-tion of this system will be centralised at General de Gaulle&apos;headquarters in London, which will work in close touch with theMinistry.I.    NEUTRAL COUNTRIES,  .SWITZERLAND.5.        Professor Keller has been negotiating with representa-tives of the Department during the entire month.      The amounts of swiss stocks were,  in certain cases with some difficulty, agreed.On the 15th October Professor Keller was informed by the minister that imports of important commodities destined for Switzerlandwould not be facilitated until the stocks in Switzerland were reduced to the level of approximately two months supplies.6.       The Minister also informed Professor Keller that noobjection would be raised to certain ships proceeding, which hadbeentwaiting our consent for a considerable time and which carriedoereals and scrap rails urgently required for Swiss Defence.
7.       Unfortunately shortly afterwards Italy invaded Greece.These ships,  as all-those on time charter to the Swiss Governmentare Greek-owned and it was therefore impossible for them to he allowed to enter the Mediterranean.     This new situation is being  Iexplored but one of the difficulties is that, owing to congestion and German control, the import of commodities to Switzerland viaPortugal and Spain has became almost impossible,8.       Professor Keller is also pressing us to consider furtherSwitzerland&apos;s petroleum requirements.9.       He has &quot;been given a provisional list of goods for whichwe are prepared to grant navicerts and export licences freely, butthe despatch of British goods to Switzerland is still held uppending a clarification of the attitude of the enemy towards tran-eit across Italy or Prance,     Such matters, it appears, aredecided by the Germans even in the case of transit across Italy.SPAIN. .   ,10,       There is remarkably little to report.     The shipnavicert system is working with comparative smoothness, and therehas &quot;been relatively little friction on the subject of rationing.When the first rationing period expired on the/,31st October, only some dozen rations out of fifty had actually been exceeded to anyextent, while twenty still had an unexpended balance.     This affordsinteresting confirmation of the view expressed in previous reportsthat any lack of supplies in Spain is due far more to shipping and exchange difficulties than to the restrictive effects of theblockade.     Attempts to help Spain to meet these deficiencieswithin the limits- of the rations have continued - though, fortactical reasons, the tempg &amp;f the negotiations and discussionswas slowed down when Colonel Beibader was replaced as Minister forForeign Affairs by Senor Suner.     The latter has, however, now asked that the various economic discussions should continue, andit has been decided in principle to pursue our former policy of facilitating supplies.11.       There has been very littie evidence of re-exports to theenemy.     On the other hand, there have been numerous reports ofGerman buying, especially in the north of Spain.     German troopsmake frequent incursions, and are reported to buy up all availablestocks of food stuffs.     Undesirable as this practice is from theblockade point of view, it has its compensationsfor it addsappreciably to the dislike of Germany felt by the local population.There is very little doubt that an acute shortage of all forms offood exists in many districts;    even bread is in short supply.Our most difficult task at the moment is therefore not so much toprevent supplies reaching the enemy (since the universal shortage in Spain largely achieves this object for us) as to ensure that,despite Axis propaganda,  it should be widelybrecognised in Spainthat the blockade is not responsible for the shortages.&quot;     With thePress entirely in German hands, this is no easy task; , but it ishoped that constant repetition in the B.B.C&apos;s Spanish broadcasts of news items relating to economic help for Spain will prove useful.PORTUGAL.12,       The rationing system has weighed more heavily uponPortugal than upon Spain owing to the fact that Lisbon normallyconducted a large entrepot trade in Colonial produce with other european countries.     The inevitable time lag between   the re-opening of land communications between Portugal and Germany afterthe collapse of Prance and the moment at which rationing becameeffective
effective resulted in the accumulation in Lisbon of large stocks ofoilseeds,  sisal,  sugar,  coffee,  cocoa and other Colonial products and in extensive sales out of these stocks to enemy and enemyOccupied territories and to other European countries. Notwith-gtanding the lack of exact statistical informations,  it became clearthat these undesirable sales could only be prevented by the iraposi-tion of an embargo upon further imports into Portugal.      accordingly the rations for the chief Portuguese Colonial products were closedat varying dates during October,  while the U.K.C.C.  continued with success its efforts tobtcjr up what remained of the stocks in Portugal.The embargo produced its expected result on October 21st, when thePortuguese Government instituted a system of control over imports,exports, re-exports and transit of all the more important commodities-ties,      Ns information is yet available as to the way in which   thislicensing system is being operated, nor is it known whether licences for enemy territories etc., are being refused.      But there hascertainly been a noticeable diminution in the number of interceptedmessages relating to sales and offers to the enemy.     Discussions arenow proceeding in Lisbon with a view to enabling the rationing system to be reconciled with the continuance of Lisbon as a re-exportcentre,  subject of course to suitable safeguards to ensure that goods are re-exported only with our approval and to safe destinations.   Forthe present, however,  the embargoes are being kept in force.13*       The imposition of the various embargoes was not executedwithout friction,  since they necessarily inflicted some hardshipupon buyers,  sellers and shippers who found themselves prevented fromexecuting their contracts;    and it proved necessary to allow certainshipments to go forward under guarantees that the goods should beheld in Lisbon at our disposal.    Imports of many commodities intoPortugal during the rationing period ending October 31st were howeverso excessive that it will be difficult to allow exceptional treat-ment to any further shipments, even if hardship to individuals is involved.1h. In the course of these discussions on rationing thePortuguese authorities have presented a list of their desiderata.These will of course be examined, but it is proposed to continuerationing on the basis of our own figures in the meantime.      So faras petroleum and its products are concerned, the Portuguese Govern-ment have now accepted in principle our proposals as to the limita-tion of stocks, and negotiations are to be resumed at an early date.15.        Portuguese ships,  though co-operating generally in theship navicert system, have not all been above reproach.      One inparticular (the s.s. Cunene) has committed a flagrant breach of thenavioert regulations by obtaining a ship navicert on the strength ofa statement that no mails were to be carried and then loading a quantity of mails.    This ship has been successfilly intercepted andis being detained at Gibraltar;      it is proposed to held the shipuntil its owners have given satisfactory assurances and undertakingsfar the future in respect of all their ships.16.       The question of censorship has given rise to some difficulty.      Dr.  Salazar complains that our regulations as to the carriage of mails have virtually cut Portugal off from communications with South America.     Though this is an exaggeration it is clear thathe feels deply on the subject, for he did not demur to a suggestionthat the difficulties might be solved by the provision of censorshipfacilities in Madeira.      This suggestion is being further pursued;in the meantime interim arrangements for improving our presentmeasures of control,  and more particularly for controlling mailsbetween -Portugal and her Colonies,  are to be put into force at anearly date.THE
- k -THE BALKANS AND TURKEY.17.       The situation in the Balkans during the last month has changed considerably.     Greece has become an ally.     Roumania is nowprostrate beneath the German heel and has ceased even to wriggle.Responsible members of both Yugoslav and Bulgarian Governments haveadmitted openly to H.M. Representatives that they are unable tomeet certain of our commercial demands, purely because the Germansrefuse their permission.     The war is moving nearer to Turkey andthe task of the Ministry in watching over the quantitites of rawmaterial supplied to a country which has considerable trade relations with the enemy, while ensuring that she has reasonablesupplies if she is called upon to fight on our side, is becoming increasingly delicate.GREECE.18.       In the early part of October the Greek Governmentcommunicated to H.M, Minister in Athens the quotas for Greekexports to Germany which had been agreed during the Greco-Germannegotiations in Berlin during September.     In most cases thesequotas do not represent serious increases over the amounts whichGreece was allowed to send to Germany under the Anglo-Greek war trade Agreement,     The figures for olive oil and chrome, however,presented a serious divergency, particularly that for chrome, ofwhich the Greeks had promised 17,500 tons to the Germans, whereas the W.T.A.  limited the figure to 2,000 tons.     H.M. Minister was instructed to inform the Greek Government that we counted upon them not to send the whole of these quantities;   and that any amount which they felt compelled to supply should be spread as evenly aspossible over the year;    that the delivery of the chrome purchasedin Greece by H.M.G. must not be interfered with; and that in theevent of Germany obtaining the full quantities of chrome and olive   ;;oil which had been agreed in Berlin, H.M.G. must reserve their right to reconsider the measures which they were taking to facili-fate supplies to Greece.19.       Meanwhile, the Italian Government appeared t^ be behaving!more reasonably towards Greece in commercial patters.     The Greek8.8, &quot;Anghyra&quot; with a large cargo chiefly consisting of steel, was   Iallowed to pass through Messina without interference, and a smallercargo en the s.s. &quot;Eleni&quot; reached Greece safely from Lisbon.Moreover, the Italians agreed to return to the Greeks such part ofthe cargo as the s,s. &quot;Attiki&quot; (previously seized by .the Italiansin spite of a safe conduct), as was not consigned to the Greek powder,and cartridge factory which had been engaged on contracts for theBritish Government,20,       The sudden attack by Italy meant, of course, a revisionof the policy of the M.E.W. towards Greece,     The chief preoccupa-tion now became the supply of goods to Greece and efforts are beingmade to see that the most urgent Greek requirements are satisfied.So far the Greek Government have been chiefly concerned to obtainstocks of coal, of which they are phenomenally short, and ofpetroleum products which they will probably no longer be able toobtain from Roumania,     The possibility of supplying some coal oargoejimmediately from Egypt and of meeting future requirements from India!are being urgently examined; and as regards oil, the companies inEgypt and Palestine have been instructed to supply Greece as may benecessary in consultation with our Civil and. Military authorities.It will still remain inadvisable to allow Greece tobuild up largerstocks of important raw materials, but with this proviso, the policy!of M.E.W.  in Greece will be to see that Greece obtains all supplies required for her war effort with the greatest possible facility.
YUGOSLAVIA.21.       The progress of the Greek campaign will have an important influence -on the Ministry&apos;s activities in   Yugoslavia.    Hitherto,all the minerals purchased from Yugoslavia have &quot;been &quot;brought cut viaSalonika.      If Salonika falls, not ^nly would any minerals purchasedhave to be sent overland to Istanbul;,   a costly and difficultjourney, but Yugoslavia would be sc cut off from the outside world,that it is doubtful whether we should be able to continue anypurchases at all..22.       In the meantime,  the Yugoslavs have been subjected to increasing German pressure.     They recently blocked in the free z^neat Salonika a quantity of 350 tons of fer-ro-chrcme which had alreadybeen paid for by us.      They have so far only agreed to the releaseof 120 tens of this quantity,  and the Minister of Commerce hasadmitted that - this action is entirely due to the objections ofGermany,  who consider 350 tons too large a consignment to be exportedall at once.      In these difficult circumstances, no progress has yetbeen made with the negotiations for a Minerals Agreement for 19U1.Until all &amp;f the ferro-chrome blocked at Salonika is freed,navicerts for Yugoslavia will not be granted.BULGARIA.23.      The Bulgarian Minister, of Commerce has informed H.M.Minister at Sofia that the Bulgarians are definitely precluded by german, pressure from giving an export permit for the -soya -which ithad hoped t.a purchase in Bulgaria.      It is now clear that anyfurther pre-emptive deals which it may be possible to conclude with bulgaria are likely to be of an unimportant- nature,    The r-epresenta-tive of the U. K.C.C.  has, however, been successful., in concluding abarter transaction by which 7? COO &quot;tons **f sunf lower-seed cake and2,5*80&apos; tons of maize are exchanged against 2,&quot;003 toes of coppersulphate, and a further 7*150 tons of maize against 112 tons mfwool.      Ssrne further deals on these lines may still be possible but-it has been decided that such deals are not of sufficient importancetc justify the supply to Bulgaria of tin or, rubber.ROUMANIA.2h.        It is now clear that there is no prospect of any furthereconomic warfare activity in Roumania.      No pre-emptive purchasescan be made and all efforts to obtain the release of the remainingFrench and British barges have failed.    The majority of the staff ofthe Goeland Company-which operated the barges Mas accordingly been evacuated to Istanbul,  as has the representative of the U.K.C.C.TURKEY.25.        The U.K.C.C   are further   developing their organisation in Turkey and have made a number ef purchases,   and investigated manyTurkish requests for raw materials and manufactured goods.Negotiations are still being pursued with the Turkish Government forthe conclusion of financial arrangements which will enable theCorporation to function smoothly.26.        The most successful activity of the Ministry in connectionwith Turkey has been the&apos; conclusion of an informal agreement with theU.S. Authorities whereby the latter agree to take over, with Turkishconsent,   a considerable portion of the    chrome which H.M.G,   are underobligation to purchase in Turkey,      Hitherto the Turkish Governmentliave refused to consider giving us permission to resell our pur-chases, of chrome, but cn the representations of the Q,8, government they
they have now modified their attitude.      Under this agreement the U.8.Government undertake to buy some h0,000 tons of hfi% chrome,  provided it can be loaded before December 31st,  at a basic price of $21  a ten,corresponding to the price of 105/-d a ton at which it was purchased byus from Turkey.      The U.S. Government have also stated that they are interested in acquiring up to 100,000 tons of suitable Turkish chromeand will consider further purchases if shipping facilities make this possible.      It was hoped at one time that the IT. 8.  Government might be willing to send ships flying the U.S.  flag into the Mediterranean tofetch the chrome,  but their final decision was that the ore should be shipped in neutral  vessels round the Gape,      The TJ. K.C.C. who have been entrusted   with the shipping arrangements, hope to be able to obtainthe necessary shins,   in spite of the complications resulting fromItaly1s attack on Greece.Uo   o   rs27.       During the last month action has been mainly devoted to bringing uxd to date the proposals for a barter agreement which were approved by the Departments concerned last June.      There has also been an exchange of telegrams with Sir Stafford Cripps.28.        The anxiety previously felt with regard to shipments ofcotton from the U.S.A.   to the U.S.8.R.  has not diminished but informalionfrom H.M. Representative at Washington has made it clear that nothing canbe done at present to limit this trade at source.      Shipments of oil from the U.S.A.  have also shown signs of exceeding the rate of200,000 tons per annum which has previously been defined as a reasona-ble limit.      It is to &quot;be hoped that when the election is over more vigorous co-operation will be forthcoming on such matters.29.        Several attempts have recently been made by more or lesssuspect North and South American firms to ship hides and quebracho toRussia.      Definite evidence was recently received which linked BataCzechoslovakia,-with this traffic.      Telegrams were accordingly sentto Washington and Moscow warning them of the enemy connection;    thatto Moscow however, pointed cut that requests for hides and tanningmaterials from Russian trading organisations for genuine Russianconsumption would be favourably considered.FRENCH AFRICAN COLONIES.30.        It has been decided to introduce the compulsory navicertsystem for imports and also to require certificates of origin and interests,  where we have local consular representation,  in the case ofLiberia, Portuguese Guinea, Prench West Africa, Madagascar, Reunionand Syria.IRAQ    -      IRAN.31.        Some progress has been made towards putting into operation the measures necessary to effect adequate contraband and enemy export control over traffic through the Persian Gulf and certain ships travel-ling via the Cape nave already been subjected to full control for        15contraband purposes.      The &quot;leak&quot; will, only be stooped, however, by theestablishment of naval control at the mouth of the Gulf,  coupled withthe extension of the certificate of origin and navicert systems to iraq and Iran.      The Foreign Office have been asked to agree to the systemsbeing extended en a compulsory rather than a voluntary basis,  the viewof the Ministry of Economic Warfare being that the many, advantages ofthe compulsory system outweigh any reduction in the risk of political repercussions which might be gained from making the systems voluntary-,H.M. Representatives in Bagdad and Tehran have agreed in principle to
the systems &quot;being made compulsory.32.        A meeting of the Departments concerned was recently heldin the Ministry of Economic Warfare to examine what measures could-he taken tc increase our influence in I rag, and Iran by means ofeconomic, pressure or inducements; with special reference to theincreased strategic importance of these countries.      A Sub-Committeewas set up tc* evolve a general plan of operations for U.K.G ,C.  forthe guidance of their representatives who will- shortly bein Bagdad and Tehran,,YEMEN.     ..33.        Pre-emptive purchases of Millet have been made to preventsupplies reaching Eritrea.      Part of these purchases have keen madefor consumption in Aden and markets are being sought far the balance.A meeting was held in the Ministry of Economic Warfare to considerthe policy to be adopted to deal with the large quantities offeringand to control prices, which have been steadily rising.34.    Contraband running by dhows has been active but theAdmiralty propose to take suitably strong measures against vesselscaught engaging in the traffic and it is hoped that this,  coupled with a policy of extensive purchases at reasonable prices,  will result in effective control,  .PAR EAST.JAPAN.35.      Reference was made in the&quot;last report to the Par EasternCommittee which has been set up under the Chairmanship of Mr.  R. A.Butler,  to co-ordinate polsey towards Japan.      An Economic Sub-C&apos;3rnml&apos;ttg?G has now .be-e..n- set up under the Chairmanship of Sir- P.;Leith-&apos;Ross with&apos; the following terms of reference  :-(a) to consider measures for the control of trade between -Japan and the several parts of the Empire with a vie&quot;&apos;/ -(i)  to the formulation of a common Empire Policy;    and:-&quot;d-&quot;  (ii) to the alignment of such a policy with these of theU.S.   and Netherlands Governments;and to report to the main Committee;(b) to advise on the treatment of any individual cases of especialdifficulty affecting more than ane Department which may arise in the current administration of the control.36.        As a result of the Committee&apos;s deliberations a telegram was despatched on theH9th October to the Dominion Governments;inviting their co-operation in a x^policy of restriction of exports      -from the Empire to Japan. &apos; It was suggested that,, pending the.development of a joint economic policy towards Japan on the part of-[the United States and the Allied Governments,  it was. desirable toIntroduce interim measures in the Empire tc prevent the Japanesefrom assisting $he enemy and building up stocks themselves.^(Evidence has been accumulating of both these aptivlties on thepart of the Japanese)... . The first step should be that the. export of-^essential goods,  including all raw materials,  should be permittedpnly under licence,  and that for the purpose of export licensing;Japan. should be treated henceforward as a &quot;dangerous destination&quot;.... As
As soon as the necessary machinery is available it could he appliedso as to enforce any joint policy agreed between the Empire and theU.S. A.      Provisionally, we have suggested to the Dominions that withoutprejudice to any more stringent restrictions already in force,  thevolume of essential exports from the Umpire to Japan,  including Chinaand Manchuria should be limited to the level of normal trade.Stricter limitations would be introduced in specific cases where theycould be justified on supply grounds.37.       Favourable replies to this approach have been received fromthe Governments of&apos;-,-South Africa and New Zealand.    Replies from canada and Australia are still outstanding.38.       A similar approach has been made to the Government of Indiaand Burma,  and it has been decided to introduce restrictions on thelines suggested for exports from the United Kingdom and the colonial empire.39.        In the development of this policy,  the co-operation of theU.S.A.   is essential.      An approach has been made to the United StatesGovernment which is recorded in the section of this Report on theUnited States.i+O.       Meanwhile the Economic Sub-Committee has been investigatinga number of particular commodities,  as well as the question of Japaneseexports to Umpire markets.1+1.       The s.s. &quot;Nagara Maru&quot;  (see paragraphs .1+0-1+1+ of MonthlyReport for September)  is still detained at Colombo,  and discussions wit]the Japanese Embassy continue. &apos;      -1+2.       The Contraband Committee decided that the s.s.  &quot;Husimi Maru&quot;now taking on board Japanese &quot;refugees&quot; in Galway,  shall call for inspection at Bermuda.CHINA.h3*       There is nothing of importance to record regarding China.Applications have been approved for certain further Chinese exportsto Russia- under the Sino-Russian Barter Agreement.INDO-CHINA AND THAILAND.1+1+.       The Economic Sub-Committee of the Par Eastern.Committee hasunder consideration the question of economic pressure on Indo-Chinaand Thailand.U.  S.  A.1+5. Lord Lothian&apos;s visit to this country has enabled the minister:t&amp; review with him the outstanding questions relating to EconomioWarfare new under discussion with the U.S. authorities. In particularLord Lothian is being supplied with material to counteract the propa-ganda undertaken by Mr. Hoover for a relaxation of the blockade and proposals have been discussed and agreed with him for strengthening ourpublicity in the U.S.A. A .representative of the Ministry will be aoatto Washington to organise this aspect of our work.1+6. At Washington the chief development during October was inconnection with the use of U.S. Export Control for economic pressure on Japan,  and incidentally for the closing of the Par Eastern leak in
AMERICA.Enemy Air Lines.51.       During recent months active steps have been taken by theMinistrythe blockade.    In view of the U.S. embargo on exports of scrap ironand steel to Japan,   imposed on the 16th October,  the empire governments have been asked to stop scrap exports to Japan, whichhave in any case been insignificant compared with those from theU.S.A.      At the same time it was decided to make a comprehensiveapproach to the U.8.  Government on the question of economic pressureen Japan and full instructions were sent to 17ashington on the 18th -October, .. * .h7.       These instructions pointed out that there was animportant difference in the methods of-economic pressure on. Japanadopted by. t he U.S-.. and by H.M.&apos; Governments,, namely,  that we had,generally,-speaking,  limited exports of most important commodities to normal 1&apos;eye.ls., &apos; while the U.-S. Government, had. imposed completeembargoesVon a very limited-list of commodities.      It was.important to cs-ordinate these two methods.     Action was therefore suggestedon the ..lines proposed to the Dominions Governments and summarised in para-graph 36 above,  and it was proposed that joint discussions between the U.S., the Netherlands, the/Dominions and H.M. governments should take place as soon as possible in London where all contrabandquestions are being co-ordinated. -I4-8.        H.M. Charge d&apos;Affaires replied on .the 21+th October thathe had no doubt that the U..S. Government would welcome the policyof limitation of exports to Japan to normal trade and that they were -becoming aware of the need for a &apos;common economic -policy towardsJapan-, --&apos;-&apos; . At the same time.,  in spite of the need for rapid action toprevent Japan from acquiring substantial stocks, it would.be&apos;exceedingly difficult to induce the U.S. Government to take an active part:--in conversations on the lines suggested.      In particular,  therewas 119 hope cf their being .ready to send representatives for. dis-cussions in London,     He therefore recommended that the first &apos; step should be .to inform the State Department unofficially of what H.M-.Government had in mind, and thought that any formal proposal for joint discussions on economic^defence should be&apos; deferred until after,the Elections,.&apos;h-9. -      Meanwhile, Mr. Marris had already discussed with theDirector of the Controls Division of the State Department the wholefield of American exports to Japan.     This discussion provided &apos;valuable information about the administration of the U.S. export control system and the State Department were asked to include in the list of commodities subject to export licence the following impor-tant ka^ materials which are not at present controlled viz:- nicikel,ri^&apos;t^^ap;0&quot;PPer? lead, zinc,  cobalt,  carbon black, titanium,  cadmiumand rubber scrap.     By the end of the month no decision on thissuggestion had been taken by the U.S. Government but it was under-stood that the proposal had been sympathetically received.     Copper,however, presented special difficulties in view of the problem of surplus production and could hardly have been made subject to-licence before the Election,50, .     Our Embassy at r/ashington has now been informed that we agree t*? postpone a further formal approach to the U.S. government until the time isnopportune for it and that we will be ready toundertake discussion at Washington if.and when the U.S. Government sodesire.   . Meanwhile H.M. Embassy will be asked to continue to approach the U.S. Authorities on individual cases where urgent action is required to prevent important quantities of key commoditiesreaching Japan,
Ministry te deny supplies ef aviation spirit to enemy air services to Seuth America.     These services can he most easily attacked attheir last fuelling points on the African Coast,  Sal Island (cape verde Islands) for the existing Italian service and Dakar for the projected German service.      The supplies at Sal Island are owned&quot;by the Socony Vacuum Co., which has given a guarantee not to supplyenemy air lines.     Unfortunately the Portuguese Government requisi-tioned these stocks and has been supplying the Italian line therefrWA satisfactory undertaking not to supply enemy air lines has beenmade an essential condition of an agreement with the portuguese government about the supply of oil through our controls.     There is some evidence that the service has already been hampered by lack ofsupplies at Sal Island and in time it may be possible to causes considerable difficulties for the enemy air lines.      The possibilityof action on the other side of the Atlantic is under consideration,but in view of the abundant supplies of aviation spirit from manysources it seems clear that the most that will be possible is toprevent the clandestine running of supplies across the Atlantic to north Africa.52.       One of the chief difficulties in combating the enemy air services is that none of the neutral Governments concerned willgive any willing co-operation so long as we have no alternativeservice to offer to them.     This Ministry therefore stronglysupports the proposal to institute a British air line, of which,however, there is no immediate prospect for lack of suitableaircraft.II.        SHIPPING CONTROL.The Ship Warrant Scheme.53.       The scheme has continued to be developed satisfactorilyin conjunction with the Ministry of Shipping, and now embraces about three-quarters of the world&apos;s total ocean-going tonnage.     Thetotal applications which were received during October cover upwards of 250 ships,  the largest number yet received in any one month.5U.       American owners of Ixl vessels have applied voluntarilyfor warrants and one American charterer of a Yugoslav vessel recently made the charter party conditional on the vessel being provided with&quot;a ship warrant.     A friendly approach to the remaining U.S. ownersmight well produce a still higher degree of co-operation with our economic war effort.55.       Except in the case of Portugal, Spain and Finland, neutraishipowners are co-operating satisfactorily.     So far as Spain .isconcerned,  it is. hoped that the example of the Trujillos Brothers wihave a salutary effect.     This firm,  in addition to owning a fleet 0:small coasting vessels, maintained, with their own and charteredships,  a service between Barcelona and Genoa.      One of their vessels:the &quot;SANTA ANA&quot; was found on examination at Gibraltar to be carryingunmanifested cargo.     The vessel was detained, the unmanifested carg&apos;was placed in Prize and Trujillos and their fleet were placed on theStatutory List.     The Company then approached H.M. Ambassador in madrid and asked that their case might be re-considered.    Anagreement has now been reached whereby out of consideration for therelease of the &quot;SANTA ANA&quot;  and of her manifested cargo and theremoval of the Company and their fleet from the Statutory List, theCompany will :-.(a)
(g)    Refrain from sending ships owned,  chartered or controlled by them to the enemy or to enemy controlled territory.(o)    So operate their fieet that no benefit financial or otherwiseshall accrue to the enemy.(c)    Enter the warrant scheme.56.        Of the four principal mail-carrying Portuguese lines GiaCelonial de Navigaoao has joined the scheme,  the Gia National deNavigacao has entered into negotiations and the adherence of the tworemaining companies is &quot;being actively sought.      Control of Portuguesemail-carrying vessels is of special importance.57.        The percentage of Finnish vessels included in the warrantscheme is very satisfactory,  considering that many of the Finnishvessels are confined to the Baltic and that Finnish vessels as awhole are more readily subjected to enemy control measures than toour own.58.       Viewed from the shipping angle, the Italian move againstGreece is unlikely to have any appreciable detrimental effect onthe general position as practically 90% of the ships under the Greekflag are either within the ships&apos;  warrant scheme - or on time charter to the Ministry of Shipping,      It is hoped that it will be&apos;.possibleto grant full Allied facilities to Greek shipjiing but, before this can be done effectively,  it will be necessary to make a fuller-examination of the position.Dij^gijninat ionmAgainstiM Non-Warrant Holders.59.        The owners of three vessels remain on the Statutory List(two vessels having been withdrawn by reason of the Trujiilo agree-ment)  and five further vessels have been recoiTunended to the Board ofTrade for inclusion In this list.      Thr.ee vessels remain on theAdvertised Ships Discrimination List and 17 vessels are on the SecretDiscrimination. List.    Sufficient evidence of enemy interest and con-trol in the s.s,  &quot;CAROLA&quot;,   at present flying the Panamanian flag,  hasnow been established to justify her diversion to a British Port forseizure in Prize should she be intercepted by one of our naval patrols.Bunker Control.60.        10h. applications were received during the month forritish. controlled facilities,  90% of which were from non-warrantolders.      The latter were subjected to varying degrees of delay inacc6rdance with the cicumstances of each particular case.Enemy Shipping Claims Committee.,61.        Claims have now been registered with the Enemy ShippingClaims Committee by British and neutral cargo owners against 300German, French,  Italian, Danish, Dutch, Belgian and Norwegian ships,This total includes all ships of any line where  there is a claimagainst one of their vessels and also includes claims againstvessels which have been sunk or scuttled where such claims have beentransferred to the shipping line concerned.      Up to the present these claims have resulted in the arrest of 32 ships.War
War Risk Insurance^of:JTuIIsj;62.       Conversations which were in progress with representativesof Lloyds and other British insurance interests have resulted in the denial&quot;of British insurance of this type for non-warrant holdingneutral vessels.     Moreover,  the i,ondon market has received assurance of sympathetic co-operation from the American Insurance interests.The possibility of similarly restricting insurance of cargoes is atpresent under consideration.C r edit s,.63.       As from a date early in November,  it will he a conditionof the opening of a credit by any British Bank or Accepting house that the goods to which the credit relates are carried on a warrantholding ship.     The Bank of England are drawing the attention of theFederal Reserve Bank to the difference between the credit-worthinessof goods carried by warrant holders and those which are not.6h.        A scheme has been devised for the control of shipping toand from Syria, French West Africa, Liberia, Portuguese Guinea,Madagascar and Reunion and awaits approval on political groundsbefore being put into operation.65.       A disquieting,  not to say critical,  situation has arisen in connection with French shipping.     The early part of the monthwas noteworthy firstly for the steadily accelerating flow Of french ships sailing to French Mediterranean ports, from not only ports inthe Colonial possessions, but also even from, ports in enemy occupiedPrance:      Secondly, for the evidence of development of a shippingorganisation on the American side of the Atlantic based cn Martiniquewith the object of providing a regular service- to Dakar or evenCasablanca,  trial trips having apparently demonstrated the facilitywith which they could be made without hindrance.      This feature isdoubly objectionable from the Shipping point of view - in the firstplace it enables freights to be&apos; earned on behalf of companiescontrolled from enemy occupied territory;    in the second place itdeals a blow at the effectiveness of the ship warrant scheme as a weapon of economic warfare.III.      CONTRABAND CONTROL.&quot;NAVICERTS.66,       The weekly average of navicert applications has risen to1,120 during October.      This shows a slight increase over the september figures.67.      Over 1,000 applications have been received for Switzerlandduring October.      Of these, more than 300 have been granted in respecof such commodities as tobacco,  films,  coal, household and officemachinery, medical equipment, manufactured wood,  toys,  syntheticdyes, manufactured cosmetics, pottery,  etc.68,        During October 20h ships have sailed with Ship Navicerts,and during the same period five ships sailed without Ship Navicerts.Of these,  four were Portuguese ships sailing far Lisbon.      The&quot;C0RV0&quot; and the &quot;GuTNE&quot; were both carrying mails.    In the case of theformer, the Contraband Committee instructed that the vessel should beintercepted,   and the mails removed at sea,  or she should be taken to gibraltar for a short detention.      But though the Admiralty were informed,  she was not intercepted.      In the case of the latter,  asthe officials were apparently ignorant of navicert procedure at Bisswhere
- 13 -where the mails and passengers were taken on,   owing to there beingne British Consul there, no action was taken beyond informing the consul at St. Vincent,      Of the others, the &quot;MARIE CHRISTINE&quot;,carrying cargo from Bissao in excess of the ration quota was allowedto proceed,  as the Contraband Committee considered that the Masterdid not deliberately contravene the rravicert regulations.     Withregard to trie &quot;AFRICA OCrDENTAL&quot; however, which was carrying aconsignment cf oil seed in excess of the Portuguese quota, the contraband Committee instructed that the vessel should be brought in.      The Admiralty were informed, but she was not intercepted.The fifth ship was the Greek &quot;AGHIOS NICHOLAOS&quot;,  carrying saltedfish which was not included in the Manifest.      The Contraband0coiiittee decided in this case that as the Master appeared to begenuinely under the impression that the cargo of fish was includedin the total of cargo sanctioned, no further action should be taken.C CNTRABAND C OMMITTEE.69.     During the month of October,  the Contraband Committee dealtwith U2. fresh ships,  and 22 cases of ships which had previously been before them were finally disposed of.IV.       ENEMY EXPORT...CONTROL.70.       During the month of October the Enemy Exports Committeedealt -with U3 applications for exemption,  21 were refused 17 were granted and consideration of 5 was deferred,        U7 applications forCertificates of Origin were referred to the Committee Vy &quot;consular officers.      10 ships were considered and seizures were directed in four cases.71.       The Committee directed that the censorship at Bermudashould not detain photographs and other press matter passing from enemy territory to the United States, unless It was particularlyobjectionable.      The bulk of this material was from American corres-coorespondents stationed in enemy or enemy controlled territory.72.       The Committee also directed that a large consignment of very valuable modern French pictures, forwarded by a Frenchman whohad recently left Paris to an Art Gallery in New York which iscentrolled from France,  should be placed in prize.73*       The Committee refused an application from the brazilian government for substantial quantities of war material from Germany.7h.       The Committee permitted the release of a Spanish blockaderunner which had been placed in prize, upon a satisfactory agreement being concluded with the owner of the vessel to withdraw this ship and the remainder of his fleet from this traffic and employ them on other routes.V._ENEMY TRANSACTIONS.75.       During the month of October as a result of apprehensionsthat all European balances would be blocked in the United States,there has been a growing transfer of funds held directly on Europeanaccount in the United States to the accounts of (a)  South Americanbanks (b) Swiss banks (c) Swedish banks.      It is a comparatively new development for South American banks ao act as cloaks,,     &quot;It wouldseem that in such countries banks welcome this business for, being,as over,  short of dollars,  it places credit at their disposal eventhough only in the form of temporary or &quot;hot&quot; money.      The mostnoticeable example is the Argentine Central Bank,  just now holdingfunds on German, Swiss, Italian and Balkan account.
- Ik -76.       The activity of Swiss &quot;banks on-German account has.notnoticeably increased.      There is, however, considerable evidence thatSwiss banks are now acting as cloaks for Bulgarian and. Roumanian t -pksboth in holding balances and In granting credits,      Swedish bankscontinue their cloaking activities and are now providing the balkan states with 0 credits.77.       The purchase of German dollar bonds has recommenced andtw a larger extent than before and the operations of a number of firms are being followed..     These firms sell mainly for delivery via SouthAmerica, Portugal and Switzerland, but there has also sprung up ofrecent weeks a demand for these dollar bonds on Swedish account.    Itis difficult to find a complete explanation for this business apartfrom the high rates of interest on the bonds bought..-     There is sonedirect German buying and the remainder can almost certainly, be tracedto the same ultimate source,  since it is unlikely that - the Swiss,Swedes or Portuguese would buy these bonds on their own account.This lavish expenditure by Germany is puzzling, but there,has not yetbeen any sign of a shortage of dollars on German account.78.        Transactions on Italian account have been,neither asfrequent nor as extensive during October as they were in the latter part of September when the encashment of.the Swiss credit was effected.This consisted of 125 million Swiss&apos; francs,- a quarter :of which wasutilised for repayment of outstanding amounts due to Switzerland^  a quarter was reserved for similar debts due to Yugoslavia and half wasconverted into dollars.      This 62-g- million Swiss francs,7 i, e.  Ik-million dollars, had been completely transferred from Swiss to italian account by the end of the third week in September..79.       Certain payments on Italian account-have been noted, butthey do net show any definite trend except to South America and to sweden.    The latter were supposed to be in respect of purchases madeby Italy from Sweden,  the amounts being converted from dollars intoSwedish kronen.80,        Our representatives at Washington have been asked topress for a stricter application of the U.S.  freezing order as regardsFrance and the French Empire since we have felt that too manylicences were being given by the United States Treasury department and we had. evidence that the Banque 1&apos;Indo Chine and others hadreceived and were using quite large amounts of dollars and that theyhad, moreover,  ceded 0 to the Banque de France,      We. have now beeninformed that the Treasury Department have themselves realised theirover-generosity and it may be hoped that they, will be less willingto grant licences in the future.      The reported withdrawal of credit facilities to the&apos; Antilles may perhaps be an. example of this more stringent application of the blocking regulations.      On the otherhand, funds have been released for the payment of..French diplomatic and consular officials in the American Continent.81.      We have had evidence, which we have passed on to washington,  of arrangements designed to avoid the freezing measures byclaiming that funds deposited in one place.- e.g. New York - were needed to cover old commitments in another.     The South American    1)countries concerned are apt to condone such measures for it means   &quot;at least a temporary increase of funds in those centres,82.       As indicated in paragraph 76 there have been considerableattempts on the part of Roumanian interests to evade the U.S.freezing measures.    They applied for the release of about 0\^million or account of a contract for Turkish cot-ton against which we made strong representations..       We now hear that the application hasbeen put on the suspense list by the U.S. Government and it willprobably not be granted.      Another application concerned just under
$3 million far the purchase of Iranian cotton.      We are again doingour best to prevent this &quot;being granted.83..       Shipments of gold from Europe to America,, mainly viaLisbon, have continued on a rapidly increasing scale.      BetweenJuly and the &quot;beginning of October some  1h million of gold wereshipped from Lisbon and while much of this may have been Portuguese(reld being transferred to the U.S.A.  for safety,  some we know,  cameeither directly or indurectly from the Bank of Prance and mor^probably came from Germany, German occupied territories or JCcrec-aoThe problem of stopping gold imports is a difficult one  since golddees not lend itself easily to the certificate of origin system,vhe only effective method would be for the U.S.A.  to refuse to import any gold at all., but that would harm us more than anyone else.      The problem continues to be studied both by the U.S.authorities, by the Treasury and ourselves.8h.       Apart from such examples as we receive of attempts toavoid U,3,  regulations, we continue to report to Washington not onlythe activity of cloaks and efforts to make payments to occupied territories, but also any transactions undertaken directly on enemyaccount which are either large or suspicious.      While they still haveno legislation under which these can be prevented,  the U.S.authorities always seem interested to know of them,  and it isthought that they put as many obstacles in their way as they can.riiey contend that it would be a too obviously un-neutral act ifthey were to refuse to allow transactions emanating from the enemywith regard to his own accounts.      The ostensible reason for blockingthe assets of invaded territories is not the fact that they may be utilised for Germany, but that those giving instructions may be acting under duress.
