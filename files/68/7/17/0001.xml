MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC WARFARE.REPORT ON ACTION TAKEN DURING THE PERIOD SEPTEMBER 1stto 30th. 19UO.        -There is nothing very outstanding to report during themonth of September, The compulsory Navicert System is proving a&quot;success and the Ship Warrant Scheme is developing satisfactorily.2,     The question of counteracting enemy and other propaganda in favour of relief supplies for occupied territories is being actively considered.3.     The Ministerial sub-Committee which is considering theproblem of surpluses is continuing its work and hopes to submitits proposals very shortly.I. ^Neutral Countries.The Petsamo Traffic.k.     Recent&apos; pressure by Germany on Sweden and Finland has ledduring the past month to the stoppage, of exports to the U.S.A.ffrom Petsamo of steel products, ultimately destined for the UnitedKingdom,&apos;:-.and to the&apos; grant of a right of transit across Finland toftforway to German troops.. We have, therefore,  suspended the issue!bf Navicerts to and from Petsamo pending consideration whetherthis traffic should-not now be stopped altogether on the groundsfthat it is under enemy control.   We have asked for the views ofT.M. Ministers in Stockholm, Helsinki and Washington and no decisionill be taken until these are received.5.     Before this&apos; suspension of traffic it had been decidedto fix rations for the main imports into Finland and a Committee.ad been set up to consider the figures.    A provisional allowance2&apos;f 2,500 tons of oils and fats, pending settlement of a finalfigure, had been agreed, while 15,000.tons of petroleum productsper quarter were to be allowed,  of which not more than 350 tonsmight be taken in the form of lubricants.6.     The question of rationing Sweden had also been underconsideration.7.     Following an appeal from the American Red Cross, permissionhas been given to Lord Lothian to grant Navicerts for a consignmentof relief goods to Finland.    These include wheat, flour, sugar,dried fruits,  clothing, lard and medical supplies, but an applicationto include also raw cotton has been refused.The Swedish tanker s.s. &quot;Sveadrott&quot;, which was permitted by the Admiralty to sail to Gothenburg last month with, a cargo of.oil for the Swedish Navy,  is now to be allowed to leave .the Balticagain on a voyage to a Gulf Port.9.     The Germans have during this month taken into Trondheimthree Finnish ships outward bound from Petsamo and refused to release them unless an undertaking was given by the -british authorities not to bring them into.a control base,    This was refusedand it is understood that the vessels have returned to Petsamo.Spain. &apos;       &apos;10.     The various difficulties described in the last monthlyreport/
report are being slowly overcome.    The ship navicert system is now working more smoothly, and ship owners are taking a firm line aboutoffers of unnavioerted cargo.    One Spanish ship has &quot;been put inPrize for attempting to carry unmanifested cargo of enemy originfrom Spain to Spanish Morocco;    two are temporarily detained at gibraltar for carrying phosphates from French Morocco (they arelikely to &quot;be released soon on setisfactcry terms) and another was diverted to Freetown, where enemy aliens were removed for internment.    Wo other&apos; incidents affecting Spanish ships call formention, unless it he the sinking of two Spanish ships by Italiansubmarines and an Italian warning that any Spanish shipsproceeding in ballast to Egypt will be sunk.11,     Good-progress has been made also with rationing.    quotas for cotton, oil and wheat have heen agreed, and the rationsfor rubber,  asphalt,   jute and hemp have been increased to meetSpanishrecpuirements.    The main difficulties are now those of supply,exchange and shipping, for which the blockade is unjustly blamed.Efforts are being made to assist Spain to obtain vegetable oils,sugar and rubher,  of all of which an acute shortage exists.12,     The wheat situation is giving rise to anxiety;,  the harvest is poor,  the shortage &quot;being estimated at 800/1,000,000 tons.Although imports should theoretically not he necessary until next year,  the peasantry,  having learnt by earlier experience,are reluctant to surrender their crops against a promise of imported supjjlies next year.    To meet immediate needs,  and to overcome the difficulties of shipping and exchange,  a scheme isbeing worked out,  under the benevolent guidance of H.M.&apos; embassy at Madrid, whereby in return for what would in effect be a dollarloan from the U.S. Government,  the Spaniards would hypothecatethe greater part of their olive oil harvest over a certain period,making good the resulting deficiency by importing vegetable oilsfrom within the sterling area. - The proposal has an obviouspolitical significance, and the U.S. Government have heen informedthat it has the blessing of H.M. Government.13.      This proposal, and the growing realization in Spain thather economic well-being is dependent upon access to the products of the sterling area,  coupled with the efforts being made to render the blockade as little unpalatable as possible without impairingits efficacy,  will,  it is hoped,  sufficiently strengthen thehands of the moderates to enable them to resist the blandishmentsand threats with which Senor Suner has doubtless returned from berlin and Rome.    But the issue is not yet certain,  and it is still necessary to weigh with care the sometimes conflicting requirementsof economic warfare and&apos; general policy towards Spain, -Portugal. .1h.     There is little to report.    Portuguese shipownerscontinue to co-operate in the working of the Navicert system;    onevessel it is true, deliberately transgressed the rules and was successfully intercepted &quot;by the Navy, hut It was unfortunatelyreleased by the authorities at Gibraltar.15.      No progress has yet heen made with the discussion of import quotas,   and rationing, which is.therefore still being applied unilaterally - so far without serious friction. Dr.Salazarhas, however,   now asked that the subject should be dealt with inmore or less formal negotiations.    This procedure is not altogetherwelcome to us, but it can do no harm so long as we continue to workon our own figures while discussions proceed.    So far as petroleumis concerned.,  no further imports are being allowed until agreement is reached; not only are stocks unduly high, hut Dr.Salazar has  so far shown himself reluctant to give the assuranceswe desire regarding the refuelling of the Italian transatlanticair/
air services in the Azores.16.      Although it is true to say that the attitude of thePortuguese Government in blockade matters has been consistentlyhelpful and friendly,  there is still evidence of considerablesales of Portuguese colonial produce to the enemy.    Imports ofsuch produce into Portugal are however rationed on the basis of domestic requirements,   so that every export to the enemy means somuch less for the domestic consumer.    As existing stocks areexhausted (and the U.K.C.C.   is playing its part here)  it may beexpected that this undesirable traffic will fall off.    Already,  itis satisfactory to note the enemy is finding difficulty in placingnew orders and has to pay exorbitant prices for such supplies ashe can still obtain.17.      Portugal,  like Spain, has a bad harvest,  and arrangements are being tentatively discussed for the supply of Australian wheatnext year.18.      The U.K.G.C.   is steadily increasing its activity in portugal.    Pre-emptive purchases of Wolfram are being made at avery satisfactory level.    We already control the production of theBeralt mines,  the largest in the country,  which is British owned.An agreement has now been concluded giving us an option on theoutput of the second largest mine Boralha which is French, owned.Hungary,_Turkey and^the Balkans.19.      During the past month,   the tendency has been for Axisdomination over the weaker Balkan states to become stronger,particularly in the case of roumania;    and prospects of pre-emptivepurchases in these countries have correspondingly diminished.Yugoslavia still maintains some resistance and continues to make available to us at least the major part of the minerals reservedunder the Minerals Protocol.    Greece also appears to be holding out better than might have been expected against German andItalian economic pressure.20.      Owing to the difficulties in present circumstances of diversion to a Contraband Control base a Mediterranean LocalTraffic Clearance scheme is now in force.    It applies only to localtraffic in the Eastern Mediterranean and Adriatic,   and to shipssailing to and from the Black Sea,  from and to ports within that area.    Ships carrying cargoes wholly approved by Consuls at ports of loading will be given a document called a Mediterranean LocalTraffic clearance,  exempting&apos;them under certain conditions fromdiversion to a base.    The navicert procedure was not considered tobe sufficiently elastic or rapid to deal with the many smallconsignments found upon such ships,  and a very wide discretionhas now been given to local Consuls to approve or disapproveshipments on the spot,  so as to make the scheme popular andattractive to shipowners.    Consuls will refer large or suspiciousconsignments to M.E.W.    It is hoped by this means to preservesome measure of control over shipments which are not as a rule of great importance.    Ships sailing without a clearance will be reported to Staff Officer Intelligence with a view to interception.Greece.21.      The Greek Government have been informed that we areprepared to buy  1^- million of tobacco outside the provisions ofthe War Trade Agreement,  if German purchases are substantially reduced as a result of Greek adherence to that Agreement.    this offer was designed to help the Greeks to resist German demands inthe/
the negotiations which were in progress in Berlin.    It is reportedthat agreement was reached between the Greek Delegation and. theGerman Government on September 20th at Berlin, hut no details ofthe agreement have yet been received.    Meanwhile, ELM. Legation at athens has been instructed to negotiate contracts for the purchaseof Greek chrome in 19h1 up to the 55,000 tons provided for in theWar Trade Agreement.    It is thus hoped that,  even if the Greeks   ,have yielded somewhat to German demands for chrome the germans will find it difficult to make purchases.22.      The Italians have established a contraband control base at the Dodecanese and are attempting to make all Greek ships inthe Eastern Mediterranean call there for examination.    The GreekGovernment,  who requested that we should raise no objection tosuch calls, have been informed that we cannot acquiespe in theestablishment of this base and that all ships for Greece which weallow to enter the Mediterranean at Suez must avoid the Dodecanese!either sailing in one of our convoys or obeying the instructions of our naval authorities.    In consequence of this decision the greeks have recently discharged the cargoes of two wheat ships in IEgypt,  and will arrange for similar future cargoes to be transferrgto private ownership on arrival at Port Said,  so that the GreekGovernment will not be under pressure from the Italians to refuse british convoys.Bulgaria. m23.      Export licences for the soya for which we have contracts!having been,  as a result of German pressure, finally refused,negotiations with the Bulgarians for a limited exchange of rawmaterials against pre-emptive purchases have been discontinued.It may still be possible to purchase some Bulgarian oilseeds andoilcake against raw materials, but the Bulgarian Government have   been informed that,  if we do not get the soya, we cannot provide   ^such valuable materials as tin and rubber.Yugoslavia.2h.      A first delivery of ferro-chrome from Yugoslavia of 100tons has been effected after long negotiations.    This isparticularly satisfactory,  as the ferro-chrome is produced by aGerman-controlled firm.Instructions have been sent to ELM. Minister in Belgradeto open negotiations with the Yugoslav Authorities for a newMinerals Agreement for 19M as soon as he considers that theappropriate moment has come.    It is proposed to aim at the purchasiof 6,500 tons of ferro-chrome,  20,000 tons of chrome,  12,000 tonsof copper,  and quantities of lead and antimony, which it is not yejpossible to determine with precision.    It will he made clear to thlYugoslavs that deliveries of raw materials and certain othervaluable commodities will be dependent on the&quot;satisfactory deliver;of minerals under the proposed new agreement. .;Switzerland^.  25.     Professor Keller of the Federal Department of national economy arrived in this country in the&apos;middle .of September andconversations were begun,    -Unexpected difficulties arose:-,:(a) The Swiss Authorities refused Export Licences for the U.K. onthe pretext that they were-obliged to do so under, the Swiss/Germ?&quot;^Agreement.    Et.M.; Minister protested vigorously and It. appears &apos; thauthe action had been, taken without the knowledge of the SwissPresident. -     ,(b) -The Swiss refused an Export Licence for&quot; the export to theU. S.A.  of jewels.. .
26.      Arrangements had been made for a Greek ship,  the MountTaurus,  to sail from Genoa to the TJ.S.A.  with a cargo of Swissexports.    She had been promised free passage by the Italians, butsoon after she sailed,  she was brought back to Genoa by Italianwarships.    She was subsequently released.27t      The first two difficulties were brought to the notice of professor Keller who was obviously at a loss to explain them.Although he was informed of the refusal of export licences for theU.K.  as early as the 23rd September no explanation had by the end$f September been forthcoming.    Meanwhile the talks &quot;continue.28.      A number of Navicerts for unimportant items have beengranted.29.      Two Greek ships,  carrying coal to Switzerland from theU.S.A..   were allowed to proceed.    No other ships have been allowedinto the Mediterranean with cargoes for Switzerland and arrangements have been made for two cargoes of grain to be sold to Spain,U.S.S.R.Trade Negotiations.30.      The immediate barter of rubber against flax suggestedby M. Mikoyan in August has been the subject of interdepartmentaldiscussion during September.    It was explained to Sir stafford cripps that our need of flax for export purposes was of some-urgency,  and it was left to his discretion to accept or refuse the proposal in the light of what he felt to be the chances ofsecuring the wider agreement.The view of this Ministry,  that we should not weaken ourposition for the larger agreement by accepting the lesser, hasnow been confirmed by Sir Stafford Gripps who has telegraphedthat after a visit to M. Vyshinski he formed the view that 3ritishresistance to Germany was beginning to have its effect in Russia.In these circumstances he felt it unwise to appear forthcomingabout the flax-rubber deal as something more valuable might beachieved by waiting a little longer.Pacific Trade.31.      Shipments of oil to VTadivostock show signs of reaching an average which would take them well above 500,000 tons per annum.Deliveries are being carefully watched in case it may be necessaryto enlist American assistance.32.     A somewhat anomalous position has arisen with regard towheat shipments to Vladivostock.    The Canadian embargo stillprohibits this trade while shipments continue from the U.S.A.    Fromthe purely contraband point of view there is little objectionto shipments up to a certain limit, but we are not anxious toencourage any shipments which would have the result of releasingRussian wheat to Germany or to German-occupied territories.    a means of reconciling Canadian and American policy within the limitations of blockade requirements is being sought.33.      A proposal is now under consideration for includingTrans-Pacific shipments within the navicert area.    Some navicertapplications have already been received in respect of cargoesdestined for Vladivostock,  though the initiative in these caseshas come from the Swedish Shipping Company concerned and not fromthe Russians.    Although these applications are strictly speakingirregular,   and cannot at the moment be enforced,  they are be ingtreated as normal in the hope of accustoming&apos; shippers to theoperation/
operation of the system,&apos; MMLt, -IRAQ...3h.      There is some evidence of transit trade to the enemythrough these countries.    For example,  the Italians have beenendeavouring to import rubber via Basrah from the netherlands east Indies and 2,000,000 metres of parachute silk is said to havebeen transported to Germany through Iraq by land route.    Thenecessary measures to effect adequate contraband and enemy export control in the Persian Gulf are being actively considered and theAdmiralty have approved in principle the establishment of aContraband Control Base at Bahrein.    The co-operation of thegovernments of India and of the Union Of South Africa is being sought.35.-     Steps have been taken to interest the United KingdomCommercial Corporation Ltd.,  in Iranian trade with a view tothe diversion of German deficiency commodities to other markets.It is hoped shortly to call another meeting of the Departmentsconcerned to discuss possible action.Kamaran.36,      News.from the Sudan, Yemen and Saudi Arabia discloses an increasing need for control of the dhow traffic in the Red Sea.This matter is being urgently considered by the Ministry and ithas been agreed that the Administrator at Karaaran should be given authority to control this traffic and direct suspicious cargoes or craft to Aden..   The final details are being worked out locallyat Aden.Af ghanijs t an v37.      A wool expert has been dispatched to Kabul in order toplace H.M. Government in a position to enter the. market for future supplies if desirable.    Russian influences appear to bemore in evidence though it would seem that the Afghans proposeplaying off Russia, Germany and Great Britain against each other intheir economic deals,J apan.Japanese protests regarding economic.....warfare.38.      On the 1lith September the Japanese Ambassador left amemorandum with Mr. R.A. Butler in which he raised four separatecuestions:(a)    Japanese cargoes, destined for Germany,_which were shipped^prior /to the &quot;outbreak &quot;of war..These have been detained since the outbreak of war, but wehave hitherto refrained from bringing them before the Prize Court,in the hope of using them as a counter in negotiations with theJapanese Government on matters of contraband control.    The JapaneseGovernment demand their release.
(b)   Trading with the enemy%MAc&quot;t^The Japanese Government demand the deletion of the names of all Japanese firms from the so-called &quot;Elacic List&quot;,    Anofficial note to the same effect has also been addressed to-Lord Halifax by the Japanese Ambassador,    The Japanese can hardly be so optimistic as to expect us. to accede to this request.(o)    Export of cqbaIt -ore from CasablancsuThe Japanese Government wish to import 1,000 tons of cobaltore from Casablanca in order,   so they say,  to clear a&quot;  balancedue to them for Japanese goods imported into Casablanca beforethe French armistice(d)   Treatment of Japanese ships^in British^portsLThe Japanese Government take strong exception to theShips&apos; Warrant system.    Their objections were communicated tothe Foreign Office in an official note from the Embassy dated september 5*    They have also protested in S-okyp;, first orallyand later in writing,    The Ministry of Shipping are in communication with the Nippon Yusen Kaishs (the Japanese ShippinCompany chiefly concerned j with a view.tc reaching an agreementwith the Company and so removing this issue from diplomaticcorrespondence,Supplies to Japan,39.    In view of the conclusion of the tripartite .treaty between Japan, Germany and Italy,  the question of the quantitiesef raw materials licensed to be exported to Japan from theEmpire is under consideration.    A Committee, under theChairmanship of.the Right Honourable R.A. Butler, M.P. has since been set up to examine this and other aspects of our policy in the Far East,
Hagara MarukO.    &quot;&quot;Before Italy&apos;s entry into the&apos; war discussions had been taking place hat we en his Majesty&apos; n Government and theJapanese Government ahout the export through Italy of certain   .quantities of German machlfiary and manufactured articles which    were said to be of vital importance to japan&apos;s national economy Iand to have been bought and paid for, with Japanese funds inGermany, before the outbreak of the war.;    and His Majesty1 sGovernment had agreed to facilitate the passage of certain ofthese consignments.      It was understood that the goods were tobe shipped on Japanese vessels already loading in Italian ports, j1x1.     One of these vessels was the s, s.  &quot;Hagara Maru&quot;, and Iit was originally understood that she would sail from Genoa with Ionly a small amount of German cargo on board.      However,  on the   119th July the Japanese Government intimated their desire thatcertain Italian goods which were urgently needed for their defence programme should also be shipped on this vessel.    A list Ispecifying seven such items was at the same time communicated to IHis Majesty&apos;s Government;    and on the 30th July a further three Iitems were added to this list.      On the 9th August His Majesty&apos;- government reluctantly agreed to allow the passage of the shipwith her German and Italian cargo on the very clear understandingsthat this would be the last occasion on which German or Italian   1goods would be allowed to proceed to Japan by sea.1x2,      The &quot;Nagara Maru&quot;, having reachedNaples, was delayed 9there by the Italian authorities who were stated to haveprohibited for the time being the sailing of all vessels fromthat port;    and on the 27th August the Japanese Governmentcommunicated to His Majesty&apos;s Government a list of additionalcargo loaded on the vessel.    This included not only machinerybut also some very large consignments of Italian mercury believedBto be worth nearly 2 million dollars,-.1+3.      The Japanese Embassy were informed that this created Ian entirely new situation,  and it was made clear to them that ourmagreement had covered only the consignment of which we had been fflpreviously notified.    Meanwhile, however,  the ship had sailed.    IWhen therefore she arrived at Colombo on the 23rd September, the Imaster was informed that the additional cargo must be unloaded, &amp;mcourse to which he raised strong objection.    His protest wasreinforced by a letter addressed to Mr. R.A. Butler by theJapanese Ambassador, who argued that our agreement covered allthe cargo that might be loaded on the ship.Ixlx.      The Foreign Office have since agreed that we mustinsist on the unloading of the additional cargo, not covered by our assurance, and the Japanese Embassy has been so informed.Japanese cargoes on Italian ships. jJ1x5.      The Japanese Commercial Counsellor, who had approached the Ministry in respect of the cargoes in three Italian ships now lying in Bangkok,- was informed that if the Japanese owners had paid for the cargoes in full before the declaration of war,His Majesty&apos;s Government would not try to prevent them fromobtaining possession of the goods but would not agree to any additional payment being made.Payments/
k&apos;o.      ITo progress has been made in respect of a draft payments agreement with Japan, arid the Treasury are consulting the otherImperial Governments as to the desirability of imposing a unilateral clearing with the sterling area.    Japan is purchasingpractically nothing from the United Jlingdom but obtains wool,wheat,  cotton,  etc,  from other parts of .-, the sterling area.Congo Basin Treaty.;hi&apos;      In spite of the representations ofthe Japanese Consul-General at Mombasa to the British authorities concerned, it hasbeen decided that the quota of 15&apos;jl of pre-war Japanese importsof piece goods etc.  into Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibarshould be maintained pending the conclusion of a payments agreement with Japan.       f&apos; .China.ho. .: The Chinese Ambassador has given. His Majesty&apos;s government an assurance that provided free passage of minerals from China is allowed through Rangoon and Hong Kong they will not permit the export of such minerals where it seems likely that these may reach our enemies.    An export permit for another 100 tonsof tin under the Sino-Soviet barter agreement has been authorised in hong Kong.U.S.A.h9.      The U.B.  Government have continued to be helpful in alleconomic warfare matters.    Thanks to the excellent&quot;relationsestablished by Mr. Purvis and Mr. Marris with the National DefenceCommission and the U.S. Treasury,  there are good prospects of close co-operation in the working of the U.3.  export licensing system.    If this can be secured, it will be of the greatest value.Exports from the U.S.  to Europe can be controlled by the navicertsystem,  out to restrict the Par Eastern traffic control atsource is essential, and it is in this direction that the U.S.Government can be of most assistance to us.50. -    There have be&apos;en^&quot;Important additions to the export licence list during the month.      On the 1.3th September exportsof equipment used for the production.of aviation-motor fuel and Tetraetliyl lead, specifications useful for such equipment and design for aircraft and aircraft engines were made subjectto licence. . More important still, on the 26th September it was announced that ail.licences for --number one scrap outstanding on-the.. 1.5th October .would be- revoked&apos; and that from the &apos;l 6th Octoberall iron. an,d steel-scrap would be subject to licence:    exports would only be allowed to the Western Hemisphere and Great Britain.This embargo on scrap exports is clearly aimed at.Japan, whoobtained- the greater part of-her - requirements, from the U. S.A.&apos; 51 .      The&apos; control of oil supplies has again been one of thechief subjects discussed with the U.S. . Government. Mr. Morgenthau,Secretary of the.Treasury, who has been asked by the president to take charge of U.S.  oil policy, has raised a number of questions about the oil agreement with Spain and the necessary explanationshave been transmitted to Washington.      The discussions aboutsupplies.to Japan from the Netherlands East Indies are still continuing.   .The 15, S..  Government have agreed to more generoussupplies - than they had originally wished to allow, but the japanese are now demanding very large quantities over a period of fiveyears/
years,to which the U.S. Government naturally take strong exception.Meanwhile the American embargo on exports of aviation spirit hasnot prevented the Japanese from buying in the U.S.A. largequantities of gasoline of a quality at least as good as that ofthe German Air Force, since the embargo has only been applied togasoline of an octane rating above 87II.   SHIPPING CONTROL.52.     During the month of September the Ship Warrant scheme has continued to develop satisfactorily,  and other aspects ofEconomic Warfare control of the use of shipping have been exploitedwherever possible.Ship. Warrants.53.     Over 200 applications for warrants were authorized duringthis month.British and Allied ships and ships whose owners are WarrantHolders, now comprise a little more than 50fo of the total ocean-goingtonnage of the world, excluding tankers.    As pressure is brought tobear, more   owners are applying for warrants for their ships.Although ships flying the U.S.A. flag are automatically grantedfull access to British Controlled facilities, nevertheless certainAmerican owners have voluntarily applied for warrants in respectof their ships.Japanese vessels continue to be subjected to the routinedelay of 2k hours, and the Japanese Government has -jprotested againstthe operation of the warrant scheme.Neutral Vessels against which discrimination is being exercised by M.E.W.524..     It has been decided to publish the names of certain shipowners against whom discrimination is being exercised, in orderthat shippers may be warned and that we may &quot;benefit from the boycottwhich it is hoped will penalize the offending shipowners.The owners of five vessels have been placed on the StatutoryList, the names of three ships have been included on the AdvertisedShips Discrimination List, while the names of sixteen ships havebeen placed on the Secret Ships Discrimination List.   Discriminationis also being exercised against three further ships, which will shortly be included in one or other of these lists.Bunkering.55.     Applications are being received by the Ministries ofShipping and Economic Warfare at the rate of some five or six per day, for permission to bunker at British or British-controlledstations.       A close watch is also being kept on the activities ofbunkering firms in neutral countries, against whom suchdiscrimination as is held to be desirable is being exercisedafter consultation with H.M. representatives in these countries.Admiralty Chart Facilities.56.     Applications from masters of neutral vessels who areunable to produce ship warrants, for Admiralty charts, hithertoobtainable from Admiralty agents against visa from a british consul at the port at which the applicants&apos; premises are situated,are now referred to the Ministry of Shipping, which after consulta-tion with M.E.W. exercises due discrimination.    The issue oflarge-scale charts and plans of approaches to harbours and roadsteadsthroughout the British Empire is now automatically denied to- neutral/
2 3j&amp; fat fneutral vessels, whose owners are not warrant holders.Pilotage and Berthage Facilities.57.      Although such facilities cannot be definitely denied to non-warrant holders, they do afford opportunities for disorientnationwhich,  although deliberate, might not necessarily appear to themasters of such ships to be intentional,  and therefore.are ofparticular value- where secret discrimination is desired.    A meetinghas boon held with the representatives of the various departmentsconeernedj and with representatives of the Dominions Governments&apos;,who have agreed to issue the necessary instructions for theexercise, with discretion, of this particular sanction.War^Risk^Insurancejm Hulls,58.      Conversations are in progress with representatives ofLloyds- and other Insurance Interests, for the denial of BritishInsurance of this type for non-warrant-holding neutral vessels.The co-operation of American Insurance Interests is being sought.Enemy Shipping Claims Committee.59.      Numerous claims affecting British-cargoes in enemy ships have been,  and are being,  registered with this Committeewhich is actively pursuing them with the minimum of. expenditure tothe British interests concerned, and is thus immobilising Germanand Italian vessels in neutral ports.    Dominion, Colonial,Indian, Burmese and Allied cargo owners&apos;have been invited to registerclaims with the Committee.    Up. to the present 26 enemy ships have teenarrested at the instance of the Committee,   ;-Credits.60.      The Bank of England has undertaken as from November 1st,1940,  to refuse authority for any commercial banking credit tobe opened by British Banks to their clients if the goods coveredby these credits are consigned on neutral vessels which are owned by non-warrant-holders.General.61.-     Surveys have been undertaken of the general Economic Warfareaspects of shipping conditions in the Iberian Peninsula,  the persian gulf and the Eastern Seaboard of the Mainland of Asia noftth ofShanghai, with particular reference to the neutral vessels engagedin these trades.    A survey has also been made of the neutral vesselstrading, between Eire and other adjacent neutral countries.62.     A meeting&quot;has been held with the Belgian, norwegian and Dutch Shipping Interests,&apos; at which the Parliamentary Secretaryexplained, to them the relationship of economic warfare, measures to shipping and invited their co-operation.63.  .   The Allied representatives promised their co-operation.At&apos; the suggestion&apos;of. the Dutch representative certain points were taken up&apos; wi t&apos;H Dutch shipping agent s in New York, wi th sat i of act cryresults.      The Parliamentary Secretary also met representatives,of the Netherlands Ministries concerned on September 10th,    Theypromised their general. co-operation,- -and undertook to consider   ^   ithe various points raised, and&apos;to -furnish their views in ttscan xa-cer.Ill/
III    CONTRABAND CONTROL&apos; Neyi certs,6h/. The weekly average of Navicert applications has risen to 962 during September. This shows a slight.increase over the august figures. .  . , .....6.5.      September has proved the. success, of the compulsoryNavicert system.
