These figures show the days on which the pits were open and do not take account of the interruption or suspension of work during air raids *Maintenance.of Production Capacity.To ensure the proper maintenance of -collieries that are closed,the Central Council of Colliery Owners have now submitted de-tailedproposals for a, levy on all sales, of&apos; about 6d. per ton., the proceeds-of which would be used to pay compensation to collieries whose 1939share of the country&apos;s total trade has been reduced as, a result ofthe war, at a rate not exceeding 2/&apos;6d. per ton of the reduction.Discussions in regard to the scheme are still proceeding.    Whencompleted, the scheme will be submitted for approval to theEconomic Policy Committee.Distribution,In the last month enemy action has seriously hindered, thedistribution of coal both by rail and sea, particularly in the.London area.     In addition, a number of public utilities andindustrial premises have been damaged so that they have not beenable, even where transport facilities have remained available, toreceive their normal supplies of coal.     The extent to which thesupply situation in London has been affected may be seen from thefollowing tableJMonthly Deliveries to Rail.the London Area.

Customs.Some reduction could safely be accepted in the deliveryrate during the coming winter, but not to anything like thatshown above, and a serious situation is bound to arise unlessdeliveries can be greatly improved.The position in other Southern areas is similar to that inLondon.     This matter Has recently been before the War Cabinet?,and under the Chairmanship of the Lord President of the Council,the Committee of the Ministers directly concerned is examining the whole position.

The Spanish market develops butslowly, mainly owing to shipping difficulties, there being few ports to which British-controlled ships can be allowed to sail.2.10.14.O.
