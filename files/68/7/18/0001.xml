(grmjiOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVXRIIHENT.SECRET. Q 127:;j3SHl,(40),, 198, COPY NO. - /pjs 5 th Octoper, 1940 PWAR CABINET.OIL    POSITION.Monthly report for September, 1940, submitted by theSecretary for Petroleum.(Previous Report:    Paper W.P.(R) (40)189.)IMPORTS.Imports during September totalled 640,500 tons, ascompared with 951,100 tons during August,During September, the partial closing of the East andSouth Coasts to tankers resulted in a large number being diverted to the Clyde for temporary laying up.     As a consequence it was found necessary to hold a considerablenumber of tankers at Halifax, N.S., until the congestioncaused by the sudden diversion to the West Coast had been dealt with.     The recent agreement of the Admiralty to alimited number of tankers of under 7,000 tons being allowedto proceed to the East and South Coasts, is easing thesituation.CONSUMPTION.Services.      Consumption in September was 20,000 tonshigher than in August.      Of this, Admiralty Fuel Oilaccounted for 18,000 tons,pivil.      Total consumption remained steady at about628,000 tons,STOCKS,Services^     Admiralty.stocks of Fuel Oil at the end ofSeptember were 84,000 tons lower in the United Kingdom, and61,000 tons higher overseas.      Air Ministry stocks of aviation Spirit in the United Kingdom were 30,000 tons higherand War Office stocks of Motor Spirit in the United kingdom were 5ft000 tons lower.Civil.     Total stocks at the end of September were303,000 tons lower than at the end of August.      Part of this reduction was due to losses be enemy action.    (See &quot;below.)GENERAL.Splinter-proof Walls&apos; at Oil Installations.The construction programme has been extended to includefuel and lubricating oil tanks;    the total capacity of thetankage affected by the various schemes in progress, is nowapproximately three million tons.     The Admiralty are preparing a programme for protecting about 2 million tons of fuel oil storage.At 30th September walls round 196 tanks, having a totalcapacity of 698,000 tons, had been completed and a further78 were 50% or more complete.
Damage by Enemy Acti on.Enemy activity against oil installations and depotsincreased during the month and substantial damage was done at some of these particularly in the Thames Estuary..Details are given in the Annex.The total quantity of oil lost during the month was76,500 tons at civil installations.Fire-fighting at Oil Installations.Two meetings have been called by the Secretary for petroleum to pool the experience gained at recent fires atoil installations and to apply the lessons learned as quickly as possible.     The meetings were attended by representatives of the Petroleum Department, the Admiralty,the Home Office and the Petroleum Board.     As a result ofthese discussions, instructions have been prepared for the guidance of fire brigade officers in dealing with oil fires,which deal inter;alia with the respective responsibilities of the fire brigade officers and the management of oil installations.     Certain measures for improving the safeguards at oil installations against fire risks are being examined in respect of all important installations by representatives of the Petroleum Department, the Home Office,and the Petroleum Board.Increased Supplementary Rations of Motor Fuel for goods vehicles.On the 29th July Regional Transport Commissioners were informed by the Ministry of Transport, on the authority ofthe Secretary for Petroleum, that increased supplementaryrations of motor fuel should be granted for goods vehicles(up to of the existing total Issued in the Region), incases where they were likely to help the national war effort,or where the use of rail instead of road transpoiet for essential traffic caused considerable inconvenience orsubstantial extra cost.The actual consumption is as followsFortnight ended July 269 16,422,165 units -81*5% of pre-war consumptionn n      Aug.    9, &apos;16,328,328     &quot;T1      ^&quot;80.8ft n          Ti&quot;   ; &quot;      Aug.  23, 16,274,130      &quot;      a 30*5% &quot;          &quot;                  &quot;,r &quot;      Sept, 6, 16,305,414      &quot;      ^ 80.7/b &quot;          &quot;                 &quot;&quot; &quot;      Sept.20, 16,374,641      &quot;      ^ 81*1ft &quot;          &quot;                 &quot;Commissioners have been asked whether on this showingthesr were of opinion that, assuming no general deterioration in the condition of means of transport, the war effort couldnot be speeded up by more liberal issues of fuel, ordifficulties arising out of the use of rail instead of road transport for essential traffic smoothed out.      Replies,generally, are to the effect that the war effort cannot bespeeded up by more liberal issues of fuel, because it has notbeen hampered through lack of fuel;    and diversions from road to rail now give rise to few serious complaints.     In tworegions, however, Commissioners find scope for more generousissues of supplementary rations.   - Damage,to &quot;the railway system by enemy action is being met by such additional issues of motor fuel as may be necessary and these factors, togetherwith the expansion of war-production, will necessitate theuse, in part, of the special increased allotment.      In somecases, damage to industrial establishments results in decreaseddemands for transport.
Increase in petrol allowances due to travellingdifficulties arising from air-raid activity.In mid-September a temporary addition to the petrolallowances for London taxicabs was authorised to coveradditional travelling due to air-raids.     About 400 privatehire cars in London were also given increased petrol rationson application for the purpose of evacuating refugees.For other parts of the country, it has been arranged thatthe Ministry of Transport shall inform the Petroleum Departmentif and when a Regional Transport Commissioner holds that conditions in his Region justify a special ration for taxicabsor for private hire cars or both.As regards private cars, no general issue of additionalrations has been made and no general announcement is proposed as to relaxing the existing rules on the subject of rations:but Divisional Petroleum Officers have been informedconfidentially that where the owner of a private car or motorcycle asks for an additional ration to enable him to reachhis place of business the Divisional Petroleum Officer may   -grant an amount equal to 300 miles travelling for the next twomonths, while warning the applicant that it should be carefullyhusbanded and used only if and in so far as public transport is impracticable.     The applicant is asked to give lifts toneighbours using the same route.As regards public transport vehicles, the Ministry ofTransport has been informed that petrol and diesel oil supplies will be forthcoming for all emergency services.Oil supplies for Japan.Discussions are proceeding with the Unites StatesGovernment on the question of supplies of oil to Japan from theNetherlands East Indies.      while the U.S. have not prohibitedthe export of normal crudes from the U.S., they have placed have to on the export of aviation spirit, aviation crude oils,and high grade lubricating oils.      The result of these measureshas been to intensify the demands of the Japanese for oilparticularly from the Netherlands East Indies.     Recentdiscussion centred especially round two points:-1. The desire of the U.S,  to reduce the currency of contracts to six months, which would mean that the companies of the Netherlands East Indies, which considered themselvescommitted to the supply of 40,000 tons of crude monthly for12 months, would have to commit what they would regard as a breach of Commercial practice in backing out of their offer.2. The supply of two cargoes of aviation spirit offered for the current year should be reduced to one cargo. Thesematters have been discussed with the Dutch Ministry in London.The Dutch Colonial Secretary felt strongly that the offers made to the Japanese in respect of the two abovepoints should be adhered to.     The Dutch fear that theJapanese would be exasperated if this were not done, andthey emphasised the fact that the U.S. have given no promise of active support on their behalf if trouble arose in the pacific.      At the same time, it is pointed out that the realgoal of U.S. policy, which is to reduce the supply of oil to japan, would be better served by letting the offers already made go through, so that one could concentrate on cutting down and delaying other orders for the further supplies, forwhich the Japanese are now asking.
It was felt in London that if any further attemptwere to &quot;be made to press the Dutch on the above matters, itwas necessary that this should be: undertaken by the U.8.Government.The U.S. Government have now agreed to the 40,000 tonsof crude per month for 12 months and the two cargoes of aviation spirit and also to offers of certain additional quantitites of crude and products from the Netherland BastIndies on a basis of supply over six months.      These offerswill now be made to the Japanese authorities in connectionwith the negotiations which are taking place in theNetherlands East Indies.Ge L .15th October, 1940.

ah: r,x.panage  to Installations and &quot;Je:xits by ^enemy Act ion^Thames Haven was attacked on seven occasions during the aonthoOn 5th GepteVber three tanks were punctured and fired and two others were damaged.    The fires were put out in a few hours..    On thefollov. ing day five more tanks were fired and an empty tank anda boiler-house were wrecked.    Further bombing on 7th Septemberresulted  in more tanks being fired and the fires were not finallyextinguished until 12th September.On 13th September &quot;slight damage was done to three tanks;but no fire resulted;.    Two spirit tanks were fired on 16th september and burned for three days.     ft, lubricating oil tank was alsodamaged.    Bombs were also dropped on 17th and 13th September, butthe damage caused was slight and there were no further fires.The total  quantity of oil lost  in these attacks wasaporoximately 37,000 tons.Seven attacks were made on Shell Haven.    On 5th Sep-tember anemoty lubricating oil tank and a number of pipelines were damage&apos;;.On the following day three lubricating oil tanks and a number ofbarrels of lubricating oil were fired.    The fires were allextinguished, the same. day.    In this raid considerable damage was caused to buildings,  steam and water mains and pipelines,    Alubricating oil super-heater was also damaged.On 7th September a spirit tank was fired and burnt for about13 hours.    On 16th September the jetty was damaged, and. all thepipelines were fractured.    A pumphouse was put out of commissionand the sea wall was damaged.    Temporary repairs have been made toenable the installation to continue operating.No damage was caused in the other three raids.    The loss of stocks in all these raids was less than 500 tons.There were six attacks on Coryton,    On 5th September 39 bombs were-dropped on the installation without damaging any &apos;cs tks orother vital points.    .0n 5th September some pipelines were v. reckedwhile they were being used for the transference of spirit and. -lubricating oil.&apos;  The oil liberated was fired.    Three small tanks were also fired0 but fires were extinguished the same day.    atank fired on 7th September was also quickly extinguished.    On10th September incendiary bombs set fire to grass  in a tank compoundbut the fire was soon put out.    Two more tanks were fired and two others damaged on ISth September; they were quickly dealt v;ith.No damage was caused in the raid, on 30th September.    Less than200 tons of oil were lost in all these raids and the operation ofthe installation was not interfered with.Serious damage was  caused by a raid on the Anglo-Americaninstallation at Pur fleet on 7 th September:,    Six tanks were firedsimultaneously and. the fire eventually involved 26 tanks- and was notextinguished until the evening of the 9th September.    Five men.,including the Assistant Manager,  were killed.    the material lossesincluded, &quot;about 23^,000 tons of oil1; Bthyl-f ill ing and can-filling shedsand a cooperage.The efficacy of splinter-proof walls round tanks was againproved by an incident at this installation on 18th September.    Bombsfell close to two tanks which had been protected  in this way andalthough the brickwork was damaged the tanks were unaffected.    A tankwhich had. not been protected was split from top to bottom and the contents  (3^500 tons of marine fuel oil) were spilled.    Host of the oil was afterwards recovered.
A large number of incendiary bombs were drooped on both theAnglo-American installations curing raids on 14th and26th September.   They were immediately dealt with by the catff anano serious damage was caused.On 10th September-, while some of the tanks in the above-groundstorage were still burning;, an H.E. bomb, assumed to be a 350-pouncfell on the centre of one of the covered tanks causing a crater40 feet in diameter.    Part of the roof collapsed and, with the concrete and earth cover; fell into the tank.    There was no fire and no oil was losto    In the opinion of the R,B.  officer whoinspected the damage^ the thin layer of concrete between the tankand the 2 fto 6 ins, of earth cover acted as a &quot;burster&apos;1 coursewith the result that the bomb exploded before it entered the tanlc.On 18th September another covered tank was hit and aboutls200 tons of spirit seeped away into the surrounding soil.    Againthere was no fire.A large number of IhL- bombs were dropped on the Isle of Graininstallation on 11th September and once again the value&quot;&quot;bf splinterproof walls was proved.    In two instances bombs fell only three feefrom tanks and although the brickwork&apos;was disrupted over aconsiderable distance the carnage to the tanks themselves was slightIn a third instance a bomb fell 27 feet from an empty tank which hadnot been walled and 25 feet from a full one which had been protectedThe empty tank was penetrated by splinters from top to bottom whilethe full tank was not damaged at alls although the brickwork wasscarred and pitted.     Other bombs caused some damage to pipelinesand a firewall and one penetrated the deck of a tanker mooredalongside the jetty.,In a further raid on 18 th September about 30 feet of retainingwall was damaged.    A tank in the adjoining Admiralty depot was firethe fire was put out in a very short tine.The installation at Llandarcy (near Swansea) was attacked on1st September.    Four tanks were destroyed and two others damaged fcythe resultant fire: which was not finally extinguished until5th September.    Stocks lost amounted to 243000 tons.During the month EM&apos;;, and incendiary bombs were dropped ondepots at Silvertown, Poplar- West Ham, Greenwich;, Barking3 Batterse&quot;Wandsworth.9 Fulham^ Hammersmith and Tdmonton in the London area andat Avonmouth;. Birkenhead, Manchester and Eastbourne.    The damage wasall of a minor nature,, the most serious being at Silvertown^ wherethe tanlc compound wall was damaged to such an extent that it wasdecided to empty the tanks pending repair of the wall-, and atAngerstein *;harf (Greenwich) where a loading way* pumphouse andair-raid shelters were damaged and the roadway between two depotswrecked.    At Edmonton 500 gallons of spirit were lost when a smalltank was punctured by shrapnel and at Birkenhead the puncturing offive tanks resulted in the loss of about SO tons of lubricating oil-
