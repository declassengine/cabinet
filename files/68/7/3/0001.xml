a       23THE COAL POSITION.Report by the Secretary for Mines.No. 21 - covering July? 1940.The confused position in the home market caused by the return ofthe French cargoes is now beginning to clear.    Some 220 ships havebeen allocated to ports in the United Kingdom and Eire and themajority of these have been unloaded:    a further 80 have been sent overseas.    These figures may not be quite complete but they representthe total number of boats notified to the Department.The present report completes a period of 3 months since the campaign for increased production was started and a programme ofstocking by public utility companies and other consumers was drawnup.    The following table summarises production during this period ascompared with last year;--Estimated quantity of saleable coal raised.May (4 weeks)June (5 weeks)Week ended 6th July&quot;        &quot; 13th     &quot;&quot; &quot; 20th     &quot;11        &quot; 27th     &quot;   (prov.)July (4 weeks) (prov.)Total for 13 weeks (prov.)1940,Tons.18,562,20024,006,7004,432,0004,412,6004,261,4004,496.90017,608,90060,171,8001939.Tons.18,543,80020,871,3004,441,5004,303,7003,893,6004,172,60016,811,40056,226,500The amount of this coal that has been disposed of overseascannot be given exactly because of the incompleteness of theinformation so far available as to the tonnage and ultimate disposalof the returned French cargoes.    The following table shows theCustoms returns for the quarter:-Coal Exports (including foreign bunkers )*1940. 1939.Tons.

Thus during this quarter roughly 4 million tons more coal was produced than in 1939 and, allowing for the returned cargoes,coal sent abroad fell by over 6 million tons.    Together theseprovided 10 million tons more coal than last year for home consumption and stocking.Weekly production and Employment.It will be seen from the first table above that productionin May, 1940, was at about the same weekly rate (4,640,000 tons) asin 1939.    In June it rose to 4,800,000 tons, or 15 per cent, above1939 level, and though it fell in July (with the drop in exportdemand) to 4,400,000 tons this rate was still about 200,000 tons upon 1939. ;The number of wage earners in the industry has naturally shewnsimilar, though not proportionate, movements.    After the low minimum of 748,600 last September, it rose to a peak of 767,500 in themiddle of June and had fallen to 759,400 by the end of July;    this figure being about 1 per cent, less than a year ago.    The fall in demand has been met in the main by a reduction in the number of dayson which pits have worked, as is shewn in the following table:-Average number of days worked a week.19401939Week endedititittitiit8th June15 th     ;&apos;22nd     &quot;29th     &quot;6th July13th    &quot;20th   &quot;27th    &quot;(prov. )5.745.735.665.495.275.295.145.375*095.094.724.934.984.794.414.76These are average figures, the situation varying very widely fromcoalfield.to coalfield.    The districts most affected by recent eventshave naturally been the exporting areas, mainly the North East coast and South Wales, whereas demands&quot; upon most other areas have continued at a high level.    The disparity which would have otherwise arisen between these two groups of areas has been considerably reduced bythe large quantities of coal now going into stock, much of it drawn from the exporting areas owing to the excessive demand on the usualsources of supply.Stocking.The following table summarises the stocking position at the endof July (except for two Items where the figures relate to 29th June).In addition 3,300,000 tons was held at the collieries but much of thiswas of doubtful quality and In any case, not having been distributed,was not readily available for consumption:-Distributed Stocks.Tons.Gas works electricity works water works railways service DepartmentsIron and Steel works general IndustryMerchantsDomestic Stocks upwards ofGovernment DumpsTotal   -    over   18.882.0003,610,0003,247,000 (including theDagenham reserve of 249,000 tons)139,0001,286,000300,0001,250,000 (29th June)5,500,000 &quot;1,400,000 (est.)2,000,000150.000ti
This figure shows an increase of more than 10 million tons overthe estimated stocks at the beginning of April;    The demand for coal for stocking by consumers is still in excess of the supplies coming forward and little margin has been available hitherto for Governmentdumps.    As other reserves are completed, however, this margin shouldrapidly increase, provided always that transport facilities are not seriously curtailed.    The co-operation of local authorities andcolliery companies has been enlisted in securing a large number of sites and in making arrangements for stacking the coal.The reserves of public utility undertakings continue to grow;the average stock for gas works being 8.8 (winter) weeks&apos;consumption and for electricity works 7.9 weeks, and for waterworks17 weeks.    The position of the main line railway companies has,however, improved but slightly - from 4.7 to 4.8 weeks&apos;  supply -and must still be regarded as unsatisfactory, in view of thefacilities available.Distribution.Before the collapse of Prance progress in the stocking campaignwas limited by the amount of coal available:    transport is new the limiting factor, and the situation has suddenly been seriouslyworsened by the limitation of convoys up and down the Channel toone a week.    It is estimated that in normal times some 100,000 tonsof coal a week reaches the south of England by coastwise transport,but under the new arrangements this will be cut down to less thanone half.    It is difficult to see how, under present railwayconditions, an additional 100 full trains a week can be run to make good the balance.A further difficulty in the distribution of coal comes from the progressive withdrawal of men and vehicles from the merchants formilitary purposes.    Temporary relief in regard to labour is being given by deferring the calling up of managers, loaders and driversuntil the end of August, but the situation is bound to become more serious when the heavier winter demand sets in.In view of these difficulties of coal transport by rail and road a scheme of progressive rationalisation has been worked out and isnow being inaugurated.    Under this it is hoped that coal trafficcn the railways may gradually be simplified by arranging for completetrainloads wherever possible, with avoidance of unnecessarily longhauls, while co-operative arrangements may be introduced at thedepots for making the more efficient use of available resources.This scheme has been explained more fully in a memorandum circulatedto the Economic Policy Committee.
