DISTRIBUTION.Reference was made in the report for September to thedifficulties which have arisen in the transport of coal toLondon and the Southern Counties generally? dnd to theappointment of a special Interdepartmental Committee on thesubject.

Apart from the obvious limitations of transport, progress towards increasing stocks at Government dumps, is- being impededby a great shortage of appliances for handling coal, the receiving-capacity of individual dumps being restricted inmany cases to a few hundred tons a day.    Discussions are proceeding between .the Department   and the Ministry of Supply to remedy this position..MAN POWER FOR DISTRIBUTION.Having regard to the difficulties of coal distributioncaused by enemy action and to the increased demands likely to bemade on road transport for this purpose arrangements have, beenmade with the Ministry of Labour and National Service for thefurther deferment of the calling up of essential workers in thecoal distributive trade until 31st December? when the position will again be reviewed.PITHEAD PRICES&apos;.With the approval of the War Cabinet, increases in pitheadprices to meet increases in production costs have been madeoperative as from 1st November, amounting to l/9d. per ton forall districts, with further, increases of 1/- per ton &quot;for
The export of coal to the few markets available continuesto depend mainly on shipping facilities.    The future allocation of tonnage for the South American ma&quot;market is expected to beeven smaller than for recent months, which in itself has beeninsufficient to meet requirements,    difficulties have   alsobeen experienced in securing tonnage for the Portuguese marketwhere coal deliveries under important contracts are in arrears,and Portuguese importers are reported to have made purchases inthe U.S. owing to the continued difficulty and uncertainty ofshipments from this country.    The Ministry of Shipping haveagreed to a specially reduced freight rate to assist shipments of anthracite to the U.S.A. during the winter months.South Wales and l/6d. for Kent.    An application for anadditional increase of 1/- per ton for Durham and the softcoal pits of Northumberland is also under consideration.These increases have been accompanied by certainconsequential increases in the price of coke and other solidfuels.The public announcement of these increases indicated that before any further review of prices took place the whole methodOf price adjustment to meet the varying circumstances of each district would be re-examined.EXPORTS.Goal Exports (Including Foreign Bunkers).1940 1939Tons TonsAugust 1,343,22k 3*896,845September 1,445*830 2,945*363Week ended   5th October 253*492 820,285M        &quot;     12th      &quot; 279*893 753*748V        &quot;     19 th      &quot; 276,564 876,089&quot;        &quot;     26th       &quot; 268,017 758,150October total (4 weeks) 1,077*966 3*208,272
