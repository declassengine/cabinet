MINISTRY OF .ECONOMIC WARFAREReport on Action taken for the period July 15thto August 31st,  19hrQ.The period - covered &quot;by this report has &quot;been notable forthe announcement of the&apos; two new-weapons on which,  in the situationresulting from the German conquests and the collapse of Prance,H.M. Government must largely rely for the effective enforcement of the blockade, namely the compulsory navieert system and the shipwarrants scheme.    There:have,also been important developments inconnexion with the: two main problems which arise from the blockadethe.disposal of surpluses of.primary products accumulating in overseas countries and-&apos; the&apos;&apos; quest ion of the relief of food shortage in the enemy-occupied territories in Europe.2. :    On the 30th- July the Minister of Economic Warfareannounced in the House of Commons that ri.li. Government had decidedto extend the&apos; navicert system to all seaborne goods consigned toany European port,  as well as to certain Atlantic Islands ana to-certain neutral- ports in North Africa.    In future ships sailing from a neutral port to any such destination must obtain navicertsfor all items of cargo -and in addition a ship navicert at the lastport of loading.    Any consignment not navi.ce.rt.ed and any ship-without a ship navicert would henceforth be liable to seizure.    Thesame rules would apply to out-going trade. , .   -.3. &quot;The new policy thus&apos; announced is of the greatest importance&apos;.    Hitherto navicerts have &quot;been regarded as a facilitywhich a shipper could obtain to -ensure the speedy passage of his .consignment through the controls, but- neither navicerts nor shipnavicerts&apos;have been compulsory nor could cargo be seized in prizesimply because no navicert had been obtained, but only if therewas sufficient evidence against the particular consignment.    now the carriage of unnaviG.ert.ed cargo. renders the ship itself liableto seizure.    Provided therefore that shipowners do not come tobelieve that&apos;they can evade our patrols&apos; with impunity,  no un-nayicerted cargo should come forward to Europe.&apos;   It will of course in present circumstances he very difficult to ensure that&apos; all ships are intercepted, -but every effort will be made to intercept -ships known to be carrying unnavicerted cargo.    In addition .theship warrants scheme, which was also announced on the 30th July     .by the Minister of Shipping,  and details of which are given inparagraphs M8 to 50 below,  will make it possible to penalise thewhole fleet of any owner who attempts to evade the blockade.    It ,is hoped therefore that blockade running will &quot;bo reduced to verysmall proportions.h. When announcing the .compulsory navicert system,  theMinister of Economic Warfare went on to give an assurance.that HisMajesty&apos;a Government had no intention of extending the blockade tocertain neutral countries.    Where supplies could reach such-neutrals without the risk of their falling into the.hands of the- .enemy, navicerts would he granted on. a scale to allow -importsadequate for domestic consumption, hut not for re-export.    MoreoverH,M.  Government would themselves assist neutrals to obtainadequate supplies.    This statement jneant that it was the intentionof II,.M&apos;. Government to impose-rationing on Spain and Portugal,another new departure.5. The problem of relief supplies for occupied territoriesis one of the greatest difficulty.    The attitude of H.M. Governmentwas stated by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the20th August.    He said it was our intention to maintain and enforcestrict/
strict blockade not only of Germany Tout of Italy, France andall the other countries that had fallen into Germany&apos;s power.H.M. Government could not agree to any food &quot;being sent tooccupied territories.    Any shortage in Europe was due eitherto German exactions or to German failure to distribute the supplies which they command.    Many of the most valuable foods are essentialto the manufacture of vital war material.    The enemy must &quot;bear the responsibility for feeding the ooeupied territories.    Meanwhile,H.M. Government would arrange in advance for the speedy entry offood into any part of the enclaved area which had genuinelyregained its freedom and would do their &quot;best to encourage thehuilding up of reserves of foods for this purpose all over theworld.    While this was/specifically stated in the Prime Minister&apos;sspeech, H.M. Government feel bound to make no distinctionbetween unoccupied and occupied France.6. German propaganda has of course made the fullest use ofthe attitude of H.M. Government,    The most serious pressure to relax the ban is to be expected from the humanitarians in theUnited States, where ex-President Hoover has already announcedplans for the relief of France, Belgium and Holland. Fortunatelypublic opinion in the United States has so far proved much morefirm against relief of occupied territories than might have been expected; and the Administration is entirely against relief tooccupied territories,  including occupied France.    unoccupied france is, however, a more difficult problem.    The President hasrecently informed Lord Lothian that he thinks that the supply of milk and medicines to children in unoccupied France should he allowed, and very strong pressure in support of this proposal mayhe expected.7. The problem of surpluses has &quot;been.actively studied inthe Ministry during the period under review.    A Sub-Committeeof the War Cabinet on the subject was set up at the end of July.It has set up machinery to review the whole subject commodity bycommodity,  and has now recommended the appointment ef a specialofficer responsible to a Ministerial Sub-Committee to work fulltime on the problem and to act as Chairman of an inter-Departmental Committee of officials.    The Sub-Committee alsoapproved the lines of a further approach to the United StatesGovernment on the subject.8. In relations with neutral countries the main featureshave been increasingly close cooperation with the United StatesGovernment,  particularly over the control of oil exports; theapplication of rationing and the compulsory navicert system to spain.and Portugal; and the development of the work of the U.K.C.C.,particularly in Greece and Turkey.    No progress has been made withthe negotiations with the U.S.S.R.  or Japan.    Increasing german domination of South Eastern Europe has made it impossible to contemplate any but the most limited trade with the countries ofthat area,  except Greece and Turkey.II Export Control in Allied Territories.9. Since the last report on this subject, relations have continued on a cordial and cooperative basis with M.Vleeschauwer,the Belgian Minister for the Colonie-s,  and his staff.    The export control system remains in force and substantial progress has beenmade in finding alternative markets in safe destinations forCongolese produce.10. Developments in the Netherlands Empire have been less satisfactory and the excellent scheme of control which was firstinstituted/
Icelandic/instituted seems now to have been abandoned.    The export policyof the Netherlands Indies to Japan,  dictated by political considerations, gives rise to a certain amount of anxiety.    TheJapanese have obtained assurances of large supplies    of variousraw materials, especially tin and oil, but they have apparentlyagreed to give guarantees against re-export of these supplies.Conversations are in progress with the Netherlands representatives,which it is hoped will.result in the re-imposition of adequateexport control to Europe.III France and the French Colonies:11. Since the capitulation of France, action has been takenby M.E.W.   in consultation with other Departments concerned toprevent cargoes from reaching Metropolitan France.    Many Frenchcargoes have been brought on to this country at an economic price for disposal by the Ministries of Food and Supply,   and the Ministryof Shipping has been in a favourable position to obtain the shipsconcerned on a time charter,12. This administrative action was initiated immediatelyafter the capitulation.    On July 30th it was formally declaredthat we proposed to treat unoccupied Metropolitan France and theFrench North African colonies as enemy territory for purposes of contraband and Enemy Export Control and these territories have accordingly been strictly blockaded.13&apos; As regards the French Colonies which were not declaredenemy territory, the M.E.W.  has collaborated closely in the workof the Campbell Committee, whose task has been to stimulateFrench resistance by economic measures.IV Neutral Countries:The Petsamo Traffic.14. The port of Petsarno, which is now the only channel through which goods destined for Finland and Sweden may,pass, has been considerably improved and:the traffic carefully organised.    ships are. sailing to this port from the United Kingdom,  the United Statesand South America and about 1,000 tons of goods a day are being-handled in eaoh, direction.    The transport from the port to therail head is carried out by lorries-&apos; for the upkeep of which H.M.Government have agreed to allow the &quot;import of limited quantitiesof petroleum products on each ship leaving for Finland.15. The Finns are naturally anxious to reserve the use ofthe port entirely to themselves, but in consideration of theassistance given by the Swedes in the organisation of the motor transport to the rail head,  the Finnish Government have agreed toallow them 30^ of the total volume of imports and 20% of the total volume of exports.16. It has been agreed that a British Consul shall beappointed to Petsamo at the earliest possible date.    He willexamine all cargoes entering or leaving the port.Iceland:17. A company called the Arctic Trading Co. Ltd, will be formed,  as a subsidiary of the U.K.C.G. Ltd.,  to administer thesubsidy which is to be paid to Iceland to enable her. moreimportant products to be sold at prices to give a reasonablereturn to the exporters and to buy:and find markets for Icelandicand Faroese products.    There is a demand in the U.K. for certain
h.Icelandic experts, especially fish; hut it is very difficulty tosupply Iceland&apos;s own requirements from the U.K.  although failure to do so will mean &quot;spending dollars to &quot;buy them in the U. S.A.-&apos;&quot;      Switzerland:18. The collapse of France has completely isolated Switzerland.It is reported that the Germans intend to exercise control overall Swiss Exports in transit across unoccupied France.    Certainneutral countries are to he regarded as &quot;good&quot; destinations,others as ,;&apos;bedu.    Particulars are not yet available and the position&amp;  the U.s. A.  is unknown.    The Germans are said to be pressing the Italians similarly to control Swiss exports passing throughItaly, and the&apos;&apos; Swiss consider it likely that the Italians will fall into line;    The German control does&quot;not appear yet to be inforce but the policy to be adopted as regards imports into-Switaesrland is now being considered in the light of this in orrnat ion.-Spain and Portugal:19. The- collapse of France not only&apos;opened up direct landcommunication between the Iberian Peninsula and Germany,  andremoved, such naval control over seaborne trade between Spain andItaly&apos;as the French had been able&apos; to exercise;    it also renderedthe ordinary procedure of Contraband&apos; Control over ships bound for the Iberian Peninsula more or less unworkable.    It was therefore decided to ration Spain and.&apos;Portugal&apos; and to enforce these rationsimposed by the compulsory navicert system. .20. This decision was announced in the House of Commons&apos; onJuly 30th,  after the Spanish and Portuguese Governments had. been assured that, while intending to restrict their imports to theirlegitimate requirements, we. would do our best to facilitate importswithin those limits.    Both Governments entered pro forma protests,but expressed their willingness to try the system&quot;out&apos;&apos;&quot;&quot;in practice.21. Go far as Portugal is concerned,  there has been no&apos;particular difficulty. &apos;  There &apos;.haye . so &apos; far been no. complaints about the rations which it has already proved necessary to close,and Portuguese ships are in; general-making proper use of thenavicert system. &apos; &apos;&quot;     ..22. Spain is a&apos;different matter.    The lack of any reliablestatistics made &apos; it difficult to work out the rations.&apos;&apos; imports and stocks of petroleum and cotton in particular seemed so highthat special -measures&quot;&apos;&apos;appeared necessary.    All &apos;shipments of oil in non Spanish tankers were Stopped While an&apos;expert from theMinistry was sent to Madrid to negotiate a settlement..   Virtualagreement has now been reached on the basis of stocks not exceeding three months consumption.    As regards cotton&apos;,  all shipments were temporarily suspended while another expert was &quot;sent to&apos; Madridto investigate the facts and agree on a figure for imports.    Fromhis preliminary investigations it appears that we had&quot;under-estimated Spanish &quot;consumption.23- The application of the compulsory navicert system to spain has given rise to innumerable difficulties.    In the present state of our relations with Spain,  it was judged politic to give to a number of Spanish ships and cargoes exceptional treatment which would not otherwise hove been justified.    But as the resultof insistence that we could make no further exceptions,  a number of spanish ships are now waiting loaded in foreign ports while&quot;discussions; proceed about their cargoes.    As regards wheat,  ofwhich five unnavleerted shipments were allowed to proceed,  it hasnow/
now been decided to inform . the &apos; Spanish Government &apos;: -(a) That no further, navicerts can he granted except within the framework of our own offer to finance through the Anglo-Spanish Clearing purchases of wheat to a total of ICO,COOtons (  of which 1.5,000 tons have already heen shipped)  and(b) That,  in view of the likelihood that the Spanish harvestwill he exhausted by March,  we will endeavour to make goodsubsequent deficiencies &quot;by exports from Australia. :2ko The United Kingdora Commercial Corporation has started work, in both Spain and Portugal,&apos; A programme -of purchases hasbeen sketched out, but &quot;operations are still in a preliminarystage.    Considerable -pre-emptive purchases of wolfram in Portugal,have, however, been made independently.25. On July 20th,  notes were exchanged between H.-MvAmbassador in Lisbon, Dr. Salasar and the Spanish Ambassadorproviding for credit facilities in the Anglo-Spanish Clearingpurchases of Portuguese; Colonial products.    The fury of theGermans.at the- success of the-negotiations, which led up to  riixsExchange&apos; of Notes is the best measure.of the achievement which it represents..   German .economic penetration is however extremelyvigorous,  and can only he successfully countered by a delicatecombination of economic pressure and economic assistance from us.- &apos; -  &apos;        -    Ilungaryu  Turkey and the Balkans,26. ..The . policy of the JVM E,.W.   towards South Eastern europe and-Turkey during the last six weeks has been chiefly directed to strengthening the position of the United Kingdom CommercialCorporation.    Much progress has been made in working out thegeneral policy to he adopted &quot;by the Corporation. &apos; In the lightof fuller knowledge of the. effects of the German conquests on theEuropean deficiency position^  It has &quot;been possible to formulatawarevised ana co-ordinated.policy for pre-emption and rationing, -The main-, new factor- in the situation is that there will be in occupied territory, a shortage during; the  coming winter of animalfodder, leading to widespread slaughtering and&apos;a consequenttemporary sufficiency of animal fats.    Oilseeds,  oilcake and fishand vegetable oils therefore take&apos;the highest place for pre-emption,  with the exception of petroleum and certain minerals,and&apos; the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation have been instructedto buy up whenever possible  supplies which are likely to reach/the enemyi -27. The quantities of re.-&apos; materials and other goods which theCorporation may supply to this area have been determined.    At thesame time,  a number of measures have heen taken to increase theGorporation&apos;s influence and bargaining power.    The chief, of these is &quot;the-grant to. the Corporation of a monopoly for the delivery to -the. Balkans.-of the following goods:- ;.-      Jute and jute -manufactures.-Rubber and rubber manufactures.Tin,  tin plate,-Raw cotton, Cotton Yarns,  Thread and piece goods..Wo.ol, noils,  tops and yarns.&apos; Tea and -coffee. . ,28, . when the Dominion Governments have expressed their concurrence in this &quot;&quot;monopoly11 policy and when the necessary arrangements have been made&apos; with the Netherlands and Belgian.Colonies,  it will be put officially into effect.    In practice,the Corporation have already been enjoying a virtual monopoly.The- commodities in :question come largely from the British and allied Empires, but some of them, e.g.  cotton and coffee are alsosupplied/
supplied normally to the Balkans &quot;by the U.S.A.   and South american countries.    Arrangements are now being made to ensure that american countries will he allowed to share any trade in these goods.29. The operations- of the Corporation in the Balkans fall&quot;broadly into two categories.    In the case of Hungary, Roumania,Bulgaria and possibly Yugoslavia., German domination is such that it is hardly possible to envisage more than the purchase ofa few commodities required for&apos; pre-emptive reasons in return for limited quantities of raw materials.    In the case of Turkey and greece it is hoped to develop trade to the greatest possible extent and meet these countries requirements in any way which may bepossible. Since Italy&apos;s entry into the war,  the Balkans,  as awhole, have been almost cut off from raw materials,  and our supplies of raw materials ought to be an extremely potent weaponfor extorting pre-emptive purchases.TurkejQ30. All the Departments of H.M. Government have been agreed on the vital importance of maintaining a friendly Turkey bysupplying Turkish requirements to the greatest possible, extent and supporting Turkish economy through the purchase of herproducts,  even when these are not essentially required by  us.To this end,  a large programme of proposals for purchasing Turkishcommodities and for despatching important supplies to Turkey hasbeen outlined to the Turkish Government.    New proposals, for financing the trade of the IT.K.C.C., designed to encourage theTurks to develop trade through the Corporation and to assure themthat any sterling derived from their sales to the corporation will be readily utilisable, have been put forward.31. A purchasing agreement for the chrome which is reservedfor us under the chrome agreement has been concluded for the period july 1st to December 31st,,  1940.    This provides for the purchaseof the whole of the present stock and production of chrome downto the end of the year, estimated at 180,000 tons,  at a priceof 105/- per ton.Greece.32. The existing German-Greek Trade Agreement was due to terminate on August 31st,  1940 and the Greek Government anticipatesevere German demands involving breaches of the Anglo-GreekWar Trade Agreement.    They have begged H.M. Government,  therefore,to give them a free hand in negotiating with the Germans on theunderstanding that they will drive as hard a bargain as theycan.    II.M. Government have urged the Greek Government&apos; to make no concessions about chrome,  and they have reserved their rightto reconsider their obligations under the Agreement when theresults of the Greco-German negotiations are known.    At the sametime,  with the object of stiffening Greek resistance,  the U.K.C.G.will make proposals for the purchase of large quantities of greek commodities,  principally chrome, magnesite,  currants,sultanas and olive oil,    The Greek Government have already beeninformed of the list of raw materials which v/e could supply.    Ifthe United States Government agree, we may be able to offerfurther substantial purchases of Greek tobacco.    It is hoped thatthe prospect of valuable commercial relations with us, which includes facilities for imports from America, will be sufficientto induce the Greek Government to present a bold face to the Axis,Roumania.33. The hostile &quot;attitude of the Roumanian Government towardsBritish/
British interests has made it necessary to withhold from Eoumania.any facilities for obtaining supplies,,    As a measure of retaliation,  three Roumanian ships have &quot;been held&apos; up in Egypt andBritish ambulances on one of these are being unloaded andrequisitioned at Haifa. &apos; Neither this measure of retaliation,however,  nor the complete cessation of Roumanian trade with the outside world, have yet induced.the Roumanian Government to give any reply to our protests. &apos;   In spite of the absence of any official trading relations-between Roumania ana the .U.K.. it maynot be impossible for the U.K.C.O. -to make some pre-emptivepurchases in Roumania on a barter basis against small quantitiesof raw materials. &apos; &apos;&apos;Bulgaria:3/1, The negotiations which were in progress with the bulgarians before Italy&apos;s,&quot;entry into the war have-been resumed in a very limited form&apos;.&apos;    Proposals have been made- to the BulgarianLegation in London for the purchase&apos;of a limited quantity&apos;of.Bulgarian products of ..higb. pre-emptive importance,   (almost .entirely oilseeds) a&apos;gains.b : the supply of raw materials up tothe same value, :.which the &apos;Bulgarian Government badly require.The Bulgarian Government, Eiowever-;,  persist in holding up-, the issueof export licences for the- soya for which - we&apos;have contracts in bulgaria.-. They havefbeen informed that unless they allow these contracts to be .fulfilled -we shall not proceed with any.proposals - -for making supplies available to Bulgaria.   -  -       ...&apos; Eszpt.L:- : % ;      MIB!I- &apos;v ;- -&apos;;ISB835. Since the beginning of the war it has been the task.-ofthe Ministry to control the supply of Egyptian cotton to dangerousdestinations.- - The recent decision of HEE Government;; to. purchase;the whole of the&apos;EgyptIan; cotton crop for this season has removed-the risk of political agitation in Egypt against, the ,fe-s.trIctionsimposed by our export control? which will beaassisted, by theU.E.O..C..

An - off er &quot;to purchase 5,000 tons of this-summer ?.s Iranianwool clip was . rejected by the Iranian&apos; Government - &quot;on politicaland other grounds&quot;.    It appears that-they were- afraid that the - - E&quot;acceptance of this offer might land them in difficulties with theGerman and Soviet authorities.    A proposal to buy,. Afghan wool has,&quot;,also been considered but the Afghan Government eventually soldmost of their available stocks- to the-Russians.    The Government,   of India have however bought 10,000 tons of Afghan cotton;whichmight otherwise .have gone to Germany. -.   a  a- a- -Ea &apos;i.      -   ;       .    , U.S. S.R. j .. a37. Mr. Gifford,   a. member of the - Ministry,  arrived in moscow on July 12th with detailed instructions about the economic aspects; of .the proposed barter conversations.    For nearly a monthSoviet,-of ficials &apos; refused-to. discuss the - question.    On the 7thAugust Sir Stafford Cfipps spoke to M. Molotov about the- delay and asked whether the&apos;. Soviet-&quot;Government wished to proceed with the   &apos;negotiations..-. IE Molotpv : admitted the importance of the proposals&quot;but said that -the -act-ion--of: formed. Government over the assets of &apos;the Baltic/States,,- which. were blocked in London, was .an . obstacle :to progress^, -Nevertheless-Sir S, Crlpps&apos;- later sawlvl.

under consideration,,38. The gold held in London by the three Baltic States hasbeen blocked and similar action has been taken by the UnitedStates -Government,.    It may be necessary to release the gold inthe United Kingdom to the Soviet Government as part of thegeneral economic negotiations.    This Ministry is concerned tosee that such action does not lead the United States Governmentto relax the blocking of the gold and assets of enemy-occupied territories in the U.S.A. which we have urged them to maintain.Lord Lothian has reported that the United States Government will certainly find it difficult to reconcile this request with therelease of the Baltic gold in London.Japan:390 The conversations between the Director-General and theCounsellor of the Japanese Embassy have not been continued sincethe 28th June.    The general outcome of these conversations, whichhad also covered certain trade questions, has been embodied in adraft letter to be sent to the Japanese Embassy,  and the dominions governments have been asked to concur in those parts of it which concern them.    In the meantime, however,  the turn of politicalevents,,  the controversy about the Burma Road,  and the Tokyoarrests, have produced an atmosphere in which it is doubtfulwhether further iDrogress can be made,    The American attitudetowards Japan also renders it difficult to contemplate givingthe Japanese Government definite assurances regarding their requirements of raw materials from British Empire sources.Nickel:hO, Since the beginning of the year,  as the result ofMr. Morgenthau&apos;s approach to Mr. Purvis, we have prevented theexport of nickel to Japan, while the Americans,  in deference tothe moral embargo, have withheld molybdenum.    For some nine months,therefore, Japan has been virtually starved of nickel matte,despite her energetic attempts, both commercial.and diplomatic,to obtain this metal.    The collapse of Prance temporarily left the main nickel production of New Caledonia, which amounts tosome h,500 tons of metal, without a purchaser,  and the japanese were anxious to obtain it.    However,  in consultation with M.E.W,the Australian Government have bought the total output of nickelmatte from New Caledonia for the next twelve months.Trans-Siberian Railway traffic,M. There is evidence of an increasing traffic to and fromGermany through Dairen and Vladivostock, with Japan and Shanghaias the entrepots.    It has not hitherto been possible to induce the Soviet Government or the Japanese Government to restrictthis trade,   and the interception of vessels carrying suspiciouscargoes has not recently been practicable in the Pacific.11: JzJ^jlU-2. The most important subject discussed with the UnitedStates Government during this period has been the control of oil-exports.    On the 19th July Lord Lothian reported that theState Department had under consideration a proposal to stop alloil exports from the U.-S.-A.   as a measure to help our blockade:and at the same time,  certain U.S. Cabinet Ministers were considering separately the possibility of an embargo on oil exportsto Japan from all sources.   -H.M. Government felt bound to pointout/
out the dangers of both proposals,    They are themselves relyinglo a great extent on U.S,  aviation petrol and especially onU.S. lubricating oils:  while if Japan,  who has large stocks of most oil requirements except aviation petrel, was faced with a world, wide oil boycott,  it might lead her to attack theNetherlands Bast indies.    In the event the Administration decidedto limit its action first to subjecting to licence exports of aviation petrol and lubricants,  tetra-ethyl of lead ( and. alsonumber one grade scrap),  and then to declaring,  for defence purposes,  an embargo on exports of aviation petrol and lubricantsto any destination outside the Western hemisphere,    li.ll.  Governmentwere, however,  assured that they would have no difficulty inobtaining their requirements in spite of the public embargo on exports.10, During August discussions have turned mainly on thesupply of aviation petrol and high-grade crude to Japan fromBritish and American Companies in the Netherlands East Indies to japan,  who is asking for increased supplies.    The U.S. Governmenthave wished to see aviation petrol refused ana contracts for crudekept to short terms, but they have been unable to preventAmerican Companies supplying Japan from the Netherlands east indies and. also from South America.;  while the netherlands government naturally -fear attack by Japan if supplies are refused,The difficult problem which has thus arisen is now being discussed with the U.S, Government and the Oil Companies in Washington byLord Lothian with the assistance of Sir Andrew Agnew,  the oilexport,  who went to the United States at the request of theU. S. G o v e r nm e n t.kk. The U.S. Government have also been most helpful overthe control of oil supplies to the Iberian Peninsula,    As partof an arrangement to reduce Spanish stocks and to keep them downto a level to be agreed by the expert of the Ministry&quot;&quot; who went to negotiate in Madrid,   the U. S. Government decided that notankers under the American flag should be allowed to sail to Spainor Portugal,  and American-controlled tankers under other flagshave also been stopped.    This has been a most encouraging example of United. States cooperation in the new methods of blockade bycontrol at the source.k5. The U.S. Government have also been very ready to cooperate over the compulsory navicert system and have been anxiousto ensure that no U.G.   ships should sail without a ship navicert.They have agreed that U.S.   ships carrying mails and passengers toLisbon should call at Bermuda for mails to be censored:   and theyhave also put pressure on Pan-American Airways to make the Clippercall regularly at Bermuda,    In this way a. dangerous gan in thehiockade should be closed,k6. No progress was made during the period, with discussions with the TJ.S. Government about the surpluses problem.    The state department have not replied to a memorandum on the subject handed to them by Lord Lothian on the 5th July,    The original proposalfor a giant cartel to handle American surpluses v/as dropped, atthe Havana Conference, which in effect referred the whole question to the inter-American Financial and Economic Committee atWashington,  of which Mr&apos;. Welles is Chairman,    There is no definitenews of the U.S. Government&apos;s.intentions, but it appears tliattheir action may be limited, to making available a credit of500,000,000 dollars to the Export and Import Bank.    Lord Lothianhas been asked to make a new approach to the State Department,stressing the importance of co-ordinating the steps to be takenin American and in Empire and Allied countries and suggestingc onsult at ion/
consultation oven possible measures,  such as storage, regulationoi production, development of new markets and uses etc.    lord lothian was to add that H.M. Government would he glad to knewwhether the U.S. Government would cooperate in carrying out theproposal referred to by the Prime Minister on the 20th Augustfor building up reserves of foodstuffs and raw materials tobe made available, at once for a free Europe.    If necessary ELM.Government would send a strong delegation to Washington todiscuss the whole problem.South America.The Ministry will be represented on the staff of theMission, which is to go to South America, to explain the policyof ELM, Government as regards British trade with South Americaand the blockade.    The South American Section has studied meansof countering the very active propaganda in South America, whichis closely bound up with German economic activity.V: Shipping Control:k8. To ensure that the utmost use is made of the weaponof Shipping Control for economic warfare purposes a new ShippingDepartment has been set up in the Ministry.    Its most importantactivity will be the administration of the Ship Warrant System.i4.9, The Ship Warrant scheme is an attempt to divide thefree tonnage of the world into those ships whose owners agree notto engage in trade prejudicial to our economic warfare objectsand interests,  and those who do not so agree.    The immediate aimis to make the scheme universal as quickly as possible,  and thedemands made of holders of warrants are limited at present tothe foilow ing:-1) not to carry cargoes to or from enemy territory2)      to -provide spontaneously full information aboutvoyages and cargoes3)      to land., all mails carried at suitable British portsIf.)      not to carry passengers of which we disapprove.The scheme facilitates the identification of potential blockaderunners and makes it possible to strike at the whole of anoffending owner&apos;s fleet by the denial of all British controlledfacilities.50, Applications received by the Ministry of Shipping cover161 neutral ships have been considered. This is, of course, onlya small beginning,   since the scheme is still in its infancy.51. Twenty three ships have been put by the Black ListCommittee on the Ship&apos;s Black List.    No ship included in theShip&apos;s Black List is able to obtain Commercial Shipping facilitiein British ports or any British controlled facilities in foreignports.52.. Since the 23rd August ships not bearing a Ship Warranthave been refused such facilities pending reference to london for specific authority.    This delay will,  it is hoped,  provesufficient to induce the victims to apply for Ship Warrants,In view of the political situation, Japanese ship owners .1....; S.VPave not been pressed to accept the Ship Warrant scheme forvessels and Japanese ships not producing a Ship Warrant are made subject only to a routine delay of 2h hours in obtaining thefacilities they require at British ports.5k/
... -M&apos;; &apos; &apos;&apos;;\&apos;\\&apos;&apos; &apos; &apos;&apos;1. &apos; , :Control of Chartering.It is hoped to use the weapon of the control ofchartering and of shipping employment) to reduce the number of potential blockade-runners Inthe Eastern Mediterranean and to bind the seaborne trade of thatares as closely as possible to Allied interests and b) to arrange for the gradual withdrawal of neutral tonnage now operating, on Japanese account on the Trans-Pacificroute,,  so as to reduce to the minimum the space which Japan can offer for the carriage of goods Intended for the enemy.Enemy Ships.    &apos;55. The defection of the French Navy made necessary new stepsto immobilise the 371 German and Italian ships sheltering in neutral ports.    These ships are the most probable and resoluteblockade runners;,   we do not want them to; earn freight on enemyaccount,  or to.be sold for the enemy&apos;s benefit; we wish alsoto keep at the lowest possible levels payments to the enemy bycargo owners, both British and neutral,  and to see that cargoes,when realised,  do not go to undesirable destinations.    For allthese reasons it is most important to prevent them moving.56. Nor this purpose a Committee has been set up under mr. Boyle,  a Director of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, to pursueclaims against enemy shipowners.    The claims will be ostensiblymade to recover cargoes but they will be used in appropriate cases to arrest and maintain the arrest of the ships,.,    TheShipping Department, will work in close touch with the new Committee.Danubian Shipping.57. The situation as regards the British controlled shipping on the Danube has not improved,   and it has not been possible tocomplete the programme of evacuation to Istanbul.    Not only theformer French, Belgian&apos; and Dutch vessels recently transferred tothe British Flag, but also those vessels which for seme time havebeen under the British Flag, have been ordered up stream and the crews removed and replaced by armed Roumanian guards.58.- Partly to frighten: the Roumanian Government the RussianGovernment were asked whether they would be prepared to buy thevessels still- in the Danube.    They showed considerable interest,but eventually declared that the conditions attached to the offerwere unacceptable and it has now been.decided not to pursuethese negotiations for the moment.VI&apos;    Contraband Controi.Navicerts53. In consequence of the decision to make navicerts and ship navicerts compulsory,  arrangements were made for ShipNavicerts to be issued in all ports in the British Empire,  andthe Ravicert&apos; system was introduced for exports to the Europeanzone from Iraq, -Iran, Thailand,  Saudi Arabia,  Japan, Liberia,the Philippine Islands,   and Spanish and Portuguese colonial possessions.60. A Ship Navicert may not be issued unless the Consul atthe last port of loading has approved the passenger list inadvance.  &quot;&quot;The Master of a ship is required to give an undertaking that any mails which are carried will be dropped for censorshipa&apos;t a nominated port.
61, As a result of the new regulations the weekly averageof Navicert applications has risen rapidly from 36O for thelast three weeks of June and hkO in July to 9k5 in August.62. Since the compulsory Navicert system was introduced,103 ships have sailed with Ship Navicerts,  and 28 have sailedwithout Ship Navicerts in circumstances where these were required.Tire 28 unnavicerted ships were not, however, &quot;by any means all&quot;blockade runners.    7 were engaged in local Mediterranean voyages,and 9 sailed from Funchal without ship navicerts owing tomisunderstood instructions to the Consul at that port.    The onlyserious cases were the five Spanish wheat ships,  referred to inparagraph 23 above,  and two ships which reached Casablanca.    Themajority of the ships concerned sailed early in August,  andthere should be a considerable improvement in September,,C port raband Gommittee.63. The number of ships dealt with by the Contraband Committeeremains small.    In August it amounted to 70 in all.    Seizuresamounting to 15,38k tons were made.Enemy Export Control.6k. During this period the Enemy Exports Committee reviewed11  ships,  directing seizures in three cases and releasing theremainder.    The Committee considered k10 applications for exemption,  directing that 12 should be granted subject to shipmentfrom a neutral port.    The remainder were refused.65.        .Enemy Exports of high value but small bulk have been removed from the westward-bound Clipper at Bermuda. &apos; As therewas some doubt whether the Reprisals Orders-in -Council coveredair-borne enemy exports,  an Order-in-Council was made on the17th July applying the existing Orders to air-borne traffic.66, The Committee has decided that certificates of originand interest should not be issued when goods would pass throughenemy territory before reaching the port of shipment, exceptIn the case of Switzerland,67,       ... There have been two important decisions for exemption.    Inone easel/deference to the views of the Foreign Office, passagewas granted to the Japanese vessel &quot;Nagara Maru&quot; with a cargo of war material of German-Italian origin from Genoa and Naples,on the understanding that the Japanese Government would not askfree passage for any further vessel with enemy exports.    At thelast moment before leaving Genoa,  the vessel, which is now atNaples,  loaded in addition a large quantity of Italian mercuryworth U.S. $2,000,000,  for which no exemption had been granted and which,  subject to the views of H.M. Ambassador at Tokyo,   itis proposed to remove when she calls at Colombo.    In the othercase it was decided,  in view of very strong representations fromthe Iranian Government,  to allow them to fetch a heavy consignmentof goods of German origin, for which exemption had been granted and which was on an Italian ship taking refuge at Assab.    in both these cases II.M.. Government felt obliged to allow exceptions to one of the main principles of Enemy Export control, . namely that exemption will not be granted to goods shipped from anenemy port.
