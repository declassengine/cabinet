MAN POWER FOR PRODUCTION.Concurrently with the raising of the minimum reservationage the -Minister of Labour and National Service is setting upTribunals with independent chairmen in &quot;the various- districts todecide^ how ;f ar. men from the coal mining. Industry can he released for service in the Forces or other industries.DISTRIBUTION.The question of coal supplies to. London and.the South has&quot;been further examined by the special Inter-Departmental Committeeon the subject,  and an Executive Sub-Committee has been appointed,to deal with the situation,   comprising- representatives of theMinistry of Transport, the four main line Railways? the Ministryof Shipping and the Mines Department.      Instances cf individualshortages are occurring with increasing frequency - and will,  assuch, be dealt with by the Executive Sub-Committee and the table below&apos;Indicates that there is a large general deficiency in supplies to the areas concerned.     Rail deliveries to Londonimproved slightly in November as compared with October, but theydid not amount to much more than half the monthly average tonnagedelivered last winter.(A) Monthly Deliveries to the London area..Rail&apos; Sea     -&apos;  total tons.

Of this quantity It Is expected that theSouthern Railway will provide for the transport of 16,000 tons aweek from the discharging points, while the remaining-4,000 tons willprobably be sent by lorry to the nearer centres of consumption.   Muchof this coal will be put into Government dumps.(B) Monthly Deliveries to the South of England by Sea(Medway to Severn)TonsAverage for October, 1939, to --March,. 1940 &apos;                                           ;  , .              241,000Mar en--* Juris, 1940 (Monthly Average) 283,000July,  1940 335,000August, 1940 167,000September,  1940                               - 193,000October,  1940 182,000l^ovember,  1940 181,000 %Reduction in November compared 60 000.with last &quot;/intera Estimated.
