(40) 199.WAR CABINET.REPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 1940 FOR INDIA,BURMA AND THE COLONIES, PROTECTORATES and mandated  TERRITORIES.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.1. Political Situation.THROUGHOUT September discussions continued between the Governor-General and individual political leaders and between the Party leaders amongstthemselves as to the reception to be given to the offer made by the Governor-General on the 8th August to appoint representative Indians to newly-createdposts in his Executive Council and to a body to be called the War AdvisoryCouncil. During the month the All-India Congress Committee endorsed therecommendation of its Working Committee, recorded in August, that theCongress should have nothing to do with the offer and reversed a previous decision to reject Mr. Gandhi&apos;s doctrine of non-violence in its application to thedefence of India against external aggression, which had involved the dropping of Mr. Gandhi as leader. The Congress now recalled Mr. Gandhi to his positionof control, and demanded the fullest freedom to pursue its policy based on non-violence. Shortly after this decision was taken the Governor-General grantedtwo lengthy interviews to Mr. Gandhi, who had sought them with the object ofdemanding freedom for the Congress to preach non-co-operation in the war effort, as a tacit condition of abstaining from civil disobedience or other similar action. The Governor-General had no option but to make it clear to Mr. Gandhithat any such action by any section of the population of India could not be tolerated. What precisely the outcome will be remains at present uncertain, but mr. Gandhi concluded by indicating to the Governor-General that he might inthe end find himself unable to &apos;&apos; carry the burden of civil disobedience &apos;&apos;; and feelthat he had no option but to decide on a fast to death.  -The Governor-General also had during the month a lengthy interview withMr. Jinnah, President of the All-India Moslem League, the upshot of which wasa formal decision by the League also, apparently passed with very little opposition, to reject the offer of co-operation with the Government of India onthe lines indicated by the Governor-General. The main causes for this rejection,as stated in the published resolution, may be traced back to the facts that theGovernor-General had made it clear to Mr. Jinnah that the League could not expect equality in numbers as between Moslems and Hindus in the expandedExecutive Council, and that he had refused also to promise that, if the Leagueaccepted, they could take it as settled that Congress representatives would not be[21829] i!
admitted to the expanded Executive Council, should they change their mind andrequest admission, without the agreement of the Moslem League.The War Cabinet have now before them the question whether, in the lightof these circumstances, it is desirable to proceed with the proposed creation ofthe new appointments for Indian political leaders in, and in association with,the Government of India.2. Military Affairs.(i) The second echelon of the Indian division referred to in paragraph 1 ofthe August report has arrived in the Middle East, and the remainder of the division is expected to arrive early in October.(ii) No. 27 Indian mountain battery at Aden is being moved to Kenya, andits replacement by India is under consideration.(iii) The Government of India have agreed to send two brigade groups anda Force Headquarters to Malaya. These are likely to sail in October and november.  Provision of the ancillary troops is still under consideration.(iv) The War Office propose to train two of the R.I.A.S.C. transport companies now in the United Kingdom in M.T. duties. The third R.I.A.S.C.Transport Company will remain as a Pack Company.(v) Arrangements are being made by the Air Ministry to send some traineraircraft to India.3. Foreign and Frontier Relations.(i) Afghanistan.Relations with the Afghan Government remain friendly. arrangements are being made to send up an expert from India to examine Afghan wool.Although most of existing stocks have been disposed of to Russia, the Ministerof Commerce has suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government might be interestedin next season&apos;s clips, which are for disposal. He has also enquired whether HisMajesty&apos;s Government or the Government of India are interested in next season&apos;scotton crop. The Government of India are not at present disposed to make anyfurther purchases of Afghan cotton, but they are interested in another Afghanproduct dried fruits and would be prepared to take a quantity of this.As regards feeling generally in Afghanistan, the success of R.A.F. raids on Berlin and Italy, carried out at such a distance from our bases, has had agood effect on public opinion, which has been further reinforced by the agreements for the American destroyers and defensive bases in the Western Hemisphere.German propaganda, however, continues very strong, and has recently been increased by the visit to Kabul of the Afghan Minister in Berlin,.who is stronglypro-Nazi. This propaganda probably appeals to a small proportion only of thegeneral public and intelligentsia, but is reported to be having some effect on a fewarmy and police officers in Kabul. The attitude of Russia remains undefined, andapprehension still exists of possible Russian aggression of a military or politicalnature.(ii) North-West Frontier.The Faqir of Ipi has been in seclusion recently. There has been some hostileactivity lately in North Waziristan, but South Waziristan has been quiet and only one or two incidents have occurred. On the rest of the frontier there hasbeen nothing to report.  In the districts there have been a few cases of kidnapping.Prayers for the success of the Allied arms have been said in the Malakandprotected area and the Kurram Agency, while Kohat Pass Afridas have sub-scribed liberally to the North-West Frontier Province fighter aeroplane fund.Mohmands are reported to be expressing sympathy with the British Governmentand hatred towards Germany and her Allies.(iii) Sinkiang.Mr. Eric Shipton, the well-known Himalayan explorer, has started on hisjourney to Kashgar, where he is to relieve Major Johnson as Consul-General. Afurther demand was received by Major Johnson from the AdministrativeCommissioner for the closure of his wireless set, which was couched in suchthreatening language that he felt it necessary to give way, and the station was closed from the 31st August.  In making this demand, the Provincial Government
claimed to be acting on instructions from the Central Government that the matter should be treated as a local one and settled in Sinkiang. Subsequently the Consul-General reported that from the 19th August a boycott of the Consulate had been started; outsiders were afraid to enter the Consulate and to supply daily require-ments. The latest news, dated the 12th September, is that the boycott has nowdecreased in intensity and that some supplies have been brought in, but anti-British feeling is still evident in the city, and it is expected that it will take some weeks before the situation returns to normal. The boycott, coupled with the closure of the wireless set, gives ground for anxiety that this may be part of a concerted attempt, at Russian instigation, to force the withdrawal of the Consul-General from Kashgar altogether. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in China has been instructed to make strong representations to the Chinese Central Government.(iv) Nepal.His Highness the Maharaja has presented the sum of 25,000 rupees for therelief of sufferers in the East End of London who have recently been bombed.(v) French India.M. Bonvin, the Governor of French establishments in India, has publicly announced that he places himself on the side of General de Gaulle.(vi) Persian Gulf.In Koweit the transfer of the American destroyers, the reinforcement of our forces in the Near East, naval successes in the Mediterranean, the bombing of berlin and the Prime Ministers speech have had a good effect, and the pro-German party has been much depressed. In Muscat people are angry over the bombing of Haifa, and the indiscriminate bombing of London.  1,000 has been collected as a first instalment to the Viceroy&apos;s war fund.4. Indian States.Nothing to report.5. Economic.Soon after the outbreak of war the need of additional skilled workers forthe ordnance factories and for engineering firms engaged in the production ofmunitions began to make itself felt in India. At first this need was met byordinary methods of recruitment, by the transfer of Government personnel fromrailways to factories and by voluntary transfers from private industrial establishments.Gradually the need became more acute and extended to the Royal IndianNavy, tlhe Army and the Air Forces; and during the summer the new situationin the Mediterranean, with the consequent new demands from the Middle Easton the resources of India, enhanced the importance of meeting the need adequately,while the growing shortage of skilled labour added to the difficulty of arrangingvoluntary transfers.After careful consideration the Government of India decided that it wasimpossible to meet this need except by taking power to compel employers to surrender skilled labour and supervisory staff to factories engaged on munitions work, and to compel workers to accept employment in any ordnance factory orany factory declared by Government to be engaged on work of national importance.This power has been taken by Ordinance, and its use is subject to various safe-guards. It applies both to Europeans and to Indians. It is expected that the ordinance will enable about 1,000 highly-trained artisans and 3,000 semi-skilled workers to be transferred to munitions- work during the first few months of its operation.The Government of India also appointed a committee to recommend measures for the quick training of new personnel. The committee has recommended ascheme which is expected to begin producing results in six months or so, and willkeep the necessity of using compulsion within the narrowest possible limits.Nothing to report.[21829]6.

BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.7. General.On the 7th September U Pu&apos;s Ministry was defeated on a No Confidencemotion by 81 votes to 32. Although his defeat was not unexpected, the magnitude of the adverse majority was a surprise. It had been known for some time thatthe Cabinet had not been functioning harmoniously, largely due to the intriguesof U Saw, the Minister for Agriculture and Forests; and matters were broughtto a head by a series of mischances connected with the appointment of a Briberyand Corruption Committee in the early part of the year. The ostensible function of this Committee was to enquire into alleged bribery in certain branches of thepublic services; and it reported that much of the corruption was due to theacts of some members of U Pu&apos;s Cabinet and its predecessors. U Pu himself wasarraigned in the Report, and though the charge was not of a serious nature, hisdissident colleagues and followers seized the opportunity to drive him from office.Three members of his Cabinet and six Parliamentary secretaries with their followers supported the No Confidence motion.It was feared that U Pu&apos;s defeat might lead to a general election, but theGovernor succeeded in forming a Ministry, with U Saw as Premier. four members of U Pu&apos;s Ministry are in the new Ministry. A No Confidence motion in the New Ministry was moved on the 18th September in the House of Repre-sentatives, but was defeated by 69 votes to 42.A statement of the new Ministry&apos;s policy was made to the Legislature on the26th September. It dealt almost entirely with domestic matters and laid emphasis on the need for preserving law and order. No reference was made to theMinistry&apos;s attitude to the war, so that at the moment U Pu&apos;s declaration ofunconditional co-operation, to which U Saw agreed, holds the field. U Sawproposes to issue soon another statement with regard to the war in general and tothe threat of aggression by Japan in particular. Before being invited to formhis new Ministry he volunteered to the Governor that he adhered to his pre-predecessor&apos;s declaration of unconditional support of the British Government in thewar against aggression, and that he had seen enough of the working of theConstitution from within, as a Minister, to be confident that it afforded asuitable road of advance to self-government.The case against Dr. Thein Maung, the ex-Minister who, as stated in thereports for July and August, was to be prosecuted for making a seditious speech,has been withdrawn on his making a statement which has been accepted as apublic apology.  -8. Press and Public Opinion.Deep concern is expressed in the Press regarding Indo-China.The bombing of Buckingham Palace was given much prominence, but noalarm was caused.  The sinking of the City of Benares aroused great indignation.9. Defence.Defence measures are proceeding in face of continuing difficulties in thesupply of essential armament and equipment. The approval of the Secretaryof State has recently been given to the raising of several new units, including three new battalions of the Burma Rifles, a four-gun 18-pounder Battery, threenew Motor Transport Sections, and to a substantial increase in the frontier force.   Elementary training is about to start in the Burma Auxiliary Air Unit.10. External Relations.A goodwill Mission from Thailand visited Burma from the 23rd-30thSeptember.   The visit is stated to have been outstandingly successful.11. Economic.Nothing new to report.
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &apos;&apos; Colonies &apos;&apos; is used to cover not only the colonies inthe restricted sense, but also protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)12. Situation in the French Colonies.During the month French Equatorial Africa has been consolidated under General de Larminafs Free French Administration. The only exception is the coastal area of the Province of Gabon, where the Governor still declines to join the movement, no doubt owing to the presence at Libreville of a submarine fromthe Vichy-controlled navy. Substantial economic assistance from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the Free French Colonies has already been given, and furtherplans for help are being worked out.It is too early yet to assess the repercussions in French West and equaltorial africa of the failure of the expedition to Dakar, but it would be unwise to minimise the set-back to General de Gaulle&apos;s prestige and the accession of strength to the Vichy Colonial administrations. There are grounds for hope,however, in the increasing seriousness of the economic situation in the Vichy-controlled Colonies and the growing contrast between this and the new prosperity of those territories which have rallied to General de Gaulle.In other parts of the French Empire there have been signs of support forthe Allied cause and the Free French Movement. In New Caledonia the pro-Vichy administration has been replaced by a pro-de Gaulle administration underM. Sautot, who was formerly French Resident Commissioner in the new hebrides and has now been appointed by General de Gaulle as Governor ofNew Caledonia and French High Commissioner for the Western Pacific andOceania. In Tahiti and the neighbouring islands the Governor has also beendeposed as a result of a plebiscite which gave an overwhelming majority forGeneral de Gaulle,&quot; and the latter has now appointed M. Mansard as Governor.In French Guiana conditions recently seemed favourable for an internal coupd&apos;Etat, and Captain Chan don, the local pro-de Gaulle military commander, was instructed to effect this. The position has, however, deteriorated as a result ofthe visit of M. Carde, the Vichy emissary, and plans for an immediate coupd&apos;Etat have been abandoned. The possibilities of effecting coups d&apos;Etat inMadagascar, Martinique, Guadeloupe and St. Pierre et Miquelon are also being-studied.13. Supply of Colonial Products.Cocoa. Arrangements have been made for the purchase by the UnitedKingdom Government of the whole of the forthcoming cocoa crops in the gold coast and Nigeria. The general scheme of control which operated last seasonwill continue with certain modifications. In particular, the fixed price paid tothe growers will be reduced by approximately 20 per cent, in view of the furtherrestriction of markets which has resulted from the spread of the war in Europe.A West African Cocoa Control Board is being set up to administer the scheme.Purchasing begins in the Gold Coast and Nigeria on the 1st October.14. Sisal.Measures necessary to deal with the surplus world production of sisal havebeen considered in consultation with the Ministerial Sub-Committee onSurpluses, and a preliminary informal approach has been made to the Nether-lands East Indies authorities with a view to agreement on a common policy forBritish East African and Netherlands East Indies producers.15. Maintenance of Supplies to Colonies.The problem of maintaining supplies to Malta has occupied an increasingshare of attention both of my own Department and of other Departmentsconcerned (principally the Ministry of Shipping and the Service Departments).
The Cabinet were fully informed on this subject in the paper which i circulated on the 16th September (W.P. (40) 374), and I will not add to what was said thereexcept to say that it will now be possible to allot some fast merchant ships to theCommander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, for the purpose of the convoyed services between Egypt and Malta. With the aid of these I hope material progress canbe made towards reducing the present deficiency of supplies in Malta.Reports on Particular Colonies.16. Hong Kong.The discussions referred to in last month&apos;s report regarding the cost of theevacuation of British European women and children have resulted in HisMajesty&apos;s Government agreeing in the special circumstances to accept thecomplete charges, in so far as expenses have to be met from public funds. these charges will be counterbalanced by the proceeds of Hong Kong war taxation,which will be remitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government as a free gift towards thecost of the war.The Government of Hong Kong have offered to put the income of the localExchange Equalisation Fund up to a maximum of  200,000 a year at the disposalof His Majesty&apos;s Government as a war contribution.Pressure has been exercised by Japanese authorities to secure the appoint-ment of a Japanese official to the office which is maintained by the ChineseMaritime Customs Administration in Kowloon. No reply has yet been given tothese representations.Pan-American Airways have requested permission for their Trans-Pacificservice to land at Singapore on alternate flights. The service at presentterminates at Hong Kong.17. Malaya.Mr. Kobayashi, the Japanese journalist whose detention was mentioned in last month&apos;s report, has since been released. Further arrests of Japanese subjectshave been made, and at present two are detained in Singapore and are being charged with offences under the Official Secrets Ordinance, viz., Mr. Shinozaki,Press Attache in the Consul General&apos;s Office, and a woman.The first instalment from the proceeds of Straits Settlements war taxation,amounting to nearly a quarter of a million pounds, has been remitted to HisMajesty&apos;s Government as a free gift.The Chinese Government have requested permission for. the transfer to singapore of certain members of their financial staff at Hong Kong in order toassist in the remittance of funds from overseas Chinese to China and the foreigncommercial operations of the National Government of China.18. Gibraltar.Arrangements for the safety and welfare of the 11,000 civilians evacuated tothis country and for their expeditious re-evacuation to the West Indies have beenengaging the close attention of my Department in conjunction with the Ministryof Health and other Departments concerned.Arrangements are in train to evacuate some 1,650 of the civil population,now in Gibraltar, whom the military authorities regard it as essential to removefor operational reasons, direct to Jamaica early in October.19. Palestine.During September the general situation in Palestine has not changed. LocalArab politicians remain generally quiet, the Defence Party and other moderatesmaintaining their pro-Government attitude. The bombing of the Jewish city of Tel Aviv on the 9th September was deplored-in Arab circles and condemnedin the Arab press as a barbarous act; the fact that it was claimed by Italy thatthe Arab town of Jaffa was the target naturally helped to harden Arab feeling against the Italians. The immediate reaction to the bombing of Haifa on the21st September, in which a mosque and a moslem cemetery were damaged and107 casualties all Arab civilians were caused, was increased bitterness against
Italy. As expected, the withdrawal from Somaliland has not materially affected the Arabs&apos; assessment of the war situation and their main interest continues tobe in the future of Syria, the battle for Britain and the operations in north africa. Developments in North Africa, particularly Egypt&apos;s attitude which isat present looked upon as distinctly half-hearted, will have an important effecton the future attitude to the war of the Arabs of Palestine.The announcement of the opening of recruiting for the Palestine infantrycompanies was made on the 15th September. To give a fillip to Arab recruitmentthe scheme was explained at a meeting in Jerusalem attended by Arab notables(principally mayors) by whom the announcement was well received. It is too early to gauge results in so far as Arabs are concerned. The Jewish press reaction tothe recruiting campaign for combatant units has been good. Extreme &quot; left &quot;elements of Zionists have expressed violent opposition to enlistment in the forces and have launched an anti-war campaign by pamphlets and other forms of propaganda.The most important recent event in Jewish politics was the resignation fromthe Presidency of the Vaad Leumi of Mr. P. Rutenberg, which coincided withthe reorganisation of the Executive Committee of that body (which now consists of ten members as against eighteen members formerly). The Revisionists nolonger have representation on the Executive Committee, while the farmers haveagreed to participate for the first time for many years. Dissensions within theRevisionist Party continue. There have been no serious outward manifestationsof hostility between that party and the Ffistadruth following upon the clashesmentioned in the report for August. On the other hand, feeling between the two parties remains bitter and may well produce an outburst if the occasion offers.There have been reports almost every day during September of robbery withviolence by armed men, including a substantial bank robbery in Tel Aviv. Therehave been several incidents of relatively large seizures of contraband, drugs and tobacco. The murder on the 19th September of a British police constable is not considered to have political significance; the real motive of the brigands was apparently robbery. Murder, robbery and smuggling are alike symptoms oflawlessness always evident in Palestine at times when it is thought that theGovernment may be pre-occupied with other matters. Present conditions in syria contribute to this state of affairs, which should not be regarded asindicative of an impending renewal of rebellion. Indeed, there is good reason tobelieve that the gangsters who have been in Palestine, referred to in paragraph 2of the August report, are seriously disappointed in the lack of response to theirovertures among the rural population. Some useful seizures of arms andammunition and explosives have been made, largely as a result of the arrest inJuly of a gangster returning from Iraq, who volunteered information.Trans Jordan remains normal.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,October 16, 1940.
