(R)(40) 185).Enemy Air Attack.. -;1.     During the first week of this period, apart from small daylightraids on Sunder land, Maids tone and Norwich, enemy activity was-mainly confined to the dropping of leaflets by night in various parts , of thecountry, mainly in South Wales.     Severe attacks, on Portland and onconvoys developed on 11th August, and between 12th and 16th August from three to five major attacks were launched daily, mainly againstaerodromes in East, South East and Southern Counties, the ports of Dover,Portsmouth, Southampton and Portland,, and the aircraft industry atRochester.     There was no activity on. 17th August.       ,f ,.&apos;..2.     Attacks were on a smaller scale between 18th and 23rd August,but considerable damage wes done at Portsmouth, Croydon and theRollaston Aircraft Works on 18th August and at Mansion Aerodrome andFilton.Aircraft YiTorks on 22nd August. .   There was very slight activity on 23rd, 27th and 29th August, , but three to six&apos; major attacks were launche-3on each of the remaining days between 24th August and September 1st.The main objectives have been aerodromes in Kent, Essex and Surrey, the ports of London, Dover and Portsmouth, and the Rollaston Aircraft factory at Croydon.     Severe attacks have also been launched against Ramsgateand Luton (Vauxhall Motors).3.     Since the 13th August, night bombing has increased in intensity,and as many as 200 towns and villages have been bombed during a singlenight.     London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Swansea,and the Tyneside have received most attention, but concentrated attacks have been either intentionally few or generally a failure.Warnings.4..    The movements of enemy aircraft by night have necessitatedpractically the whole Country being under &quot;Purple&quot; warning each.night.The Bristol Channel ports have been under &quot;Red&quot;, warning almost everynight, and London has been under &quot;Red&quot; warning during, eight of the lastnine nights of the period.Casualties. - -5.     :.The total civilian casualties caused &apos;by enemy action duringthe period exceed 1,000 killed and 1,200 seriously, injured.
-2-Damage.6.     The civilian damage done is slight in relation to the numberof bombs dropped.     The most serious incidents occurred at ^Oil Installations,Llanreath Oil Tanks, Pembroke (8 of 15 tanks fired).Llandarcy Oil Refinery,Aircraft Factories;.Rollaston Aircraft Works, Croydon. .;-   Pobjoy and Shorts Aircraft Factories, Rochester.Bristol Aircraft Factory, Filton.Other Industrial Premises.&quot;&apos; ;B.S.A. Works, Birmingham.International Ice and Cold Storage Company Ltd., Southampton.Vauxhall Motor Works, Luton.Railway Communications.Portsmouth.Swansea. (G.W.R. Station).Private Property.Portsmouth. . ,Ramsgate (whole streets demolished). ,&apos;,Fires.7.    During the last two weeks many-incendiary bombs have been dropped including in addition to large numbers of the 1 kilo type, anumber of heavy oil bombs (probably about 250 lbs).     Where these -latter have fallen directly on buildings, large fires have resulted,but otherwise no serious difficulty has been experienced in dealingwith them.8,    -The most serious fire was that at Pembroke Dock, whereAdmiralty supplies of, oil fuel have now been burning for 13 days,involving the sending of substantial reinforcements of fire-fightersI from two neighbouring Regions.     Fires resulting in serious damagehave also occurred at several R.A.F. stations.9,     Attempts have been made to set fire to crops, but the resultshave been negligible,     There have been a few woodland, heath andforest fires which have been extinguished by beating or by smotheringthe bombs with earth.     Experience is still showing the efficiency ofthe stirrup hand pumps for dealing with incipient fires resultingfrom incendiary bombs.Conduct of the Civil Defence Services.10,     The skill, enthusiasm and endurance of the Civil defence services have been frequently remarked upon during the period of thissummary.     Fire services, Casualty Services and Rescue Parties have rendered a great deal of help to R.A.F, stations, and several membersof the Police, Fire and Wardens Services have been killed in action.One fireman was injured by enemy attacks during the fire-fightingoperations at Pembroke Dock.     The Women1 s Voluntary Services have rendered valuable assistance, notably in maintaining mobile canteensat the scene of fires in Birmingham.
llo   Satisfactory reports of the mobilisation of the services have been received.., and of the calling out of personnel &quot;on call&quot;.In some areas Services have been working at very high pressure, with less than &quot;one night&quot; in bedo   Intensive attacks on several districts,notably-Dover, Margate and Ramsgate, have proved to be a severe strain on the fire-fighting personnel, and arrangements are being made to relieve the situation by exchanging some of the whole-time auxiliaryfiremen with firemen from brigades which nave been less hardly pressed.12o   Sightseers and unauthorised road traffic have on occasionseriously hindered the working of the services.Pablio Order and Morale s13o   Morale continues to be excellent even in heavily bombed areas,and Chief Officers of Police in all parts of the country comment on thecalmness and courage which the public are showing, in sorce cases to thepoint of foolhardinessa14o   Criticism of the warning system is, however, widespread, andin some areas&apos;the apparent absence of anti-aircraft defences is alsocriticise do &apos; Though some critics of the- warning system think that publicwarnings are given too frequently, most of the criticism is directed against the failure to sound warnings when raiders can be heard and sometimes until after bombs have been dropped.150   There is great confidence in the public and domestic steelshelters, and isi some areas people are adopting the practice of sleepingin shelters even when no warning has been soundedo     There.has been acertain amount of movement from areas where warnings have been frequentto quieter area so     In a few cases air raids by night are said to havehad an advert   effect upon attendance at work of factory workers, andin some factories night shifts have been discontinued.Lighting Re^strictiqnsQ16o   In view of the intensification of night raiding, the speciallow intensity street lighting which local authorities were permitted to adopt earlier in the year has been prohibited within 12 miles of theSouth and South-West Coasts and the coast of South Wales.Smoke Screens.17p   Further steps have been taken to increase the amount. of darksmoke emitted in certain industrial areas.     &apos; -The arrangements have nowbeen extended to include non-industrial undertakings, such as hotels,offices, and schools, as well as factories.Anti-Gas Preoautionso18.   Steps have been taken to-warn residents in East and South.Coast areas discreetly of the possibility of cloud gas attack from thesea and to ensure that the Civil Defence. Servioes are on the alert whenconditions are favourable for such an attackoDefence Areas.19.   An Order has been made under&apos;Defence Regulation 16A which,brings the whole of Great Britain into one or other of the Defence Areas.Regional Commissioners are thereby empowered to issue orders or directionsfor the purpose1 of controlling movement or. dealing with any emergencythat may arise on.account of eneny action.
