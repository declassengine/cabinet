GENERAL.Splinter-proof walls at oil installations.(a) United Kingdom.     The programme now approved&apos; embracesnearly 4&quot;miiiion tons&quot;of tankage.    Up to the end of October,just over 1 million tons had been completed.(&apos;b) Middle East and -Singapore.      Work has commenced onthe construction &quot;of wails at British and Americaninstallations in the Middle East.    The tonnage involved is1,173,000.Damage to-oil installations by enemy action.The damage during October- was much less than during   -Septembe r. ...There were three Incidents at Purfleet during the month.The most serious was on 6th October, when, during a daylightraid, an H.E. bomb fell on the Shell-Mex Installation.    Theloss of stocks was about 5,000 tons of Fuel Oil, but ninetanks, having a total capacity of about 12,000 tons, were destroyed as well as a certain&apos; amount-of plant.On 1st October, an H.E./bomb struck one of the underground tanks smashing&apos; the roof and splitting a side.About 400 tons of.spirit were lost.On the morning of 20th October, an H.B. bomb dropped onan underground tank, involving a negligible loss of oil.On- 2&apos;6th October, two II.E. bombs fell on theAnglo-American depot at Silvertown.  - Only a small quantity ofspirit was lost.,     &apos;A number of smaller incidents occurred at other,installations and depots in various parts of the country,but the damage caused and the loss of stocks was trivial.Increase in allowances of petrol to Motorists in theLondon Area owing to difficulties^of rail transport.In order to relieve the public transport services in the-London/area, a &quot;Help your Neighbour&quot; scheme for motoristswas introduced on the 1st November.      Motorists who livewithin a radius of 20 miles of London are being givensupplementary ration coupons to enable them to- travel byroad&apos; to and from their places of business provided they .undertake to carry a full complement of passengers fromtheir own district in both directions.     -The-scheme is beingoperated through the A.A.  and R.A.C.      Up., to the12th November, 17,300 cars had been, given/supplementary.allowances.     The extra petrol required is estimated to beless than 1,000 tons a month.     It has been decided.tocontinue the scheme until the 31st January next.After the attack on Coventry, the Divisional- PetroleumOfficer opened a special office in the City and. is dealinggenerously with requests from; traders.
Oil supplies for Japan.An agreement has been reached between the netherlands east Indies Oil Companies and Japanese Oil Importers at atotal rather less than had been accepted by the U,8,government as reasonable.      In addition to the 40,000 tons per month ofcn7.de oil for 12 months, the agreement covers additional imports at the rate of 1,500,000 toii3 &quot;per annum, includingthe quantities needed by the British and U. 3-.  Oil companies for their quota of trade in Japan, but commitments have only been entered into in respect of the additional quantitiesfor a period of six months.     The total Quantities representabout half the Japanese demands.      The Japanese alsopressed for a 5-year contract and have expressed their keendisappointment at the short periods covered by the agreement.
