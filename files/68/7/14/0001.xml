Copy No.     5^72nd October, 1940.W A R    CABINETPood Situation of the United Kingdom.TWELFTH REPORT submitted by the Minister of Food for the monthof August, 1940, incorporating the report on home production for the sameperiod prepared by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries inconjunction with the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretaryof State for the Home Department.Ministry of Food, S.IV. 1.2nd October, 1940.

MINISTRY   OF   FOODREPORT FOR AUGUST 1940SUPPLY, CONSUMPTION. STOCKS, PRICES AND RATIONING-1. INTRODUCTORY SUMMARYWith the present Report the description of the food situation in thefirst year of war is brought to a close.    During the early months the cautionof neutral shipowners and the time taken to organize convoys caused a seriousreduction in food imports.    The position was partially rectified by the diversion of extra shipping to North American Atlantic ports.    A considerable improvement in the shipping position for all commodities occurred at the end of1939 and continued into the early months of 1940.    The invasion of Denmark,Norway, Holland and Belgium cut off a large proportion of our imported suppliesof dairy produce, bacon and eggs,&apos;   Despite all difficulties bulk stocks (i.e.those held in cold stores, port and inland warehouses, mills, refineries,factories- and emergency depots) of the more important commodities were in nearly all cases greater at the. end of the first year of war than at the end of August1939, the exceptions being tea, eggs, sugar and rice.    Tea and egg stockshave been halved;    sugar stocks are about 13$ below August 1939; rice stocks are down by about 20$.   Wheat stocks have increased by over 50$ and stocksof meat have been doubled.During the first year of war imports of foods and feeds into theUnited Kingdom totalled 20,609,000 tons (excluding crude whale oil), being590,000 tons in excess of the Ministry&apos;s import programme (20,019,000) but2,300,000 tons less than average imports during the five years 1934/35 to1938/39.    The principal surplus over programme was 562,000 tons of wheat and flour and the principal deficit 420,000 tons of cereal feeds.    Cargoesoriginally intended for Continental Europe contributed about one million tons to our imports.   Had it not been for this windfall, the Ministry&apos;s import programme would have been unfulfilled by about half a million tons.Losses of foods and feeds at sea during the first year of. waraccounted for 524,000 tons (para. 21).    The relatively heavy losses during june-August 1940 continued during the early part of September.   Whereas inthe first year of war, taken as a whole, sinkings were equivalent to 2.5$of total food and feed, imports, during the three months June-August 1940 theyexceeded 5$, averaging about 100,000 tons per month.&apos;,or .1. 2 million tons perannum.   Diverted cargo imports, which were approximately twice as high assinkings in the first -year of war, are likely to be negligible in the second year of war.The tables and diagrams&apos; in the appendix3^ depict the supply positionof the principal foods and animal feeds.    Other points of major interest are summarised below.The effects of the aerial blitzkreig have, so far, been small inrelation to total stocks (para   22), the greatest relative loss being nearly one week&apos;s supply of sugar, about half a week\s supply of tea, and about one-third week&apos;s supply of animal feed.    Losses of productive capacity due to! d?struction of mills amount to about 5-g$ of the U.K. flour milling capacity5^32?% of the oilseed crushing capacity.    Damage to the margarine factory at-furfleet prevented production for about three weeks, but manufacturing hasrecommenced although on a reduced scale.j In order to reduce concentrations of stocks of wheat, flour mills areoeing operated at maximum capacity and the flour is being widely dispersedipara.  2).* In the forecasts for October and November no allowance has been made for possiblelosses at sea or by air attack.    Shipping has not yet been arranged for a large part of the November imports and the predictions for that month are therefore lessaccurate than those for September and October.
Purchases of fat stock have been limited to 80f^ of offerings (para. 6),Stocks of bacon and ham have continued to decline.    Additionalpurchases are now being made in Canada and the maintenance of a four ounceration is dependent on being continued (para. 7).The possibility of increasing the sugar ration is dependent on thesuccessful processing of the home crop and the fulfilment of the import programme during the remainder of 1 940 (para. 8).The consumption of liquid milk increased in August (para. 9),Stocks of butter have declined rapidly and a reduction in the rationhas been announced (para. 11).Supplies of eggs during October-December 1940 are likely to be greaterthan during the three preceding months (para. 13).A small increase in the stocks of tea took place in August,    If theshipping programme is implemented and losses due to air raids are not excessiveit should be possible to de-ration tea in the New Year (para. 14).Supplies of dried fruit available for the Xmas trade are likely to beless than 50% of normal (para.15).The cereal harvest is now, in the main, safely garnered, withouthindrance by the enemy.   The latest estimates of the 1940 crop for the UnitedKingdom are, wheat 1,555,000, barley 1,080,000 and oats 2,704,000 tons - a totalof 5,539,000 tons compared with the 1936/39 average of 1,649,000, 796,000 and1,955,000 tons respectively, totalling 4,400,000 tons.   The 1939 total was,540,000 tons.    The consumption of these crops has, of course, already startedbut they represent a substantial addition to stocks, and as long as they remain on farms, are not vulnerable to air attack.   Two important food crops remain tobe harvested, viz. main-crop potatoes and sugar beet.On the other hand the drought and ploughing up campaign, have combinedto reduce the supplies of grazing, the hay crop, and the anticipated output offodder.roots.    The livestock population has, as yet, shown little decline.The supply of concentrated feeding-stuffs has been impaired somewhat by drawingupon stocks intended for winter feeding.    In view of the uncertainty of the feeding-stuffs outlook, the Agricultural Departments are formulating administrative and technical details of schemes (which can be put into force at short notice)for the rationing by farms of feeding-stuffs to each of the various classes of livestock.   No estimate can yet be made of the effects, which might be serious, ofthe rationing of animal feed on the output of livestock products.The stock index of the major foods (i,e. the number of weeks supply interms of the equivalent calorie values of the human food commodities shown inTable II, together with condensed milk and jam) increased from 10,7 weeks&apos; supply at the end of July to 16.7 weeks&apos; at the end of August, mainly due to theinclusion of the new home wheat crop, most of which is not yet threshed.    Stocksequal to a further two weeks&apos; supply are estimated to be in the hands of retailers.The predicted stocks at the end of November, which include this season&apos;s potatocrop and part of the new sugar crop, will be equivalent to 20.3 weeks1 caloriesupply, excluding retailers&apos; stocks.The stocks of concentrated animal feeds (including oilcakes) at theend of August were equivalent to about 29 weeks&apos; supply at the summer rate of consumption and about 13-15 weeks&apos; supply at the winter rate.    The increase inthese stocks from 7.8 weeks&apos; supply (at the summer rate of consumption) at theend of July is of course mainly due to the new home cereal crop;    the proportion,however, which will finally be available for animal feeding is uncertain.   Oilcakeswhich are essential to effective milk production were equal to 11,5 weeks&apos; supply(at the summer rate of consumption) at the end of August (or 8-g- weeks&apos; supply atthe winter rate).
2.   WHEAT, FLOUR AND BREAD(in terms of wheat)Total U.K, stocks on August 31st 3,821,000 tons estimated weekly total consumption (September) 150,000     &quot;Estimated weekly consumption as flour (September) 125,000     &quot;Imports of wheat and flour (in terms of wheat) averaged 148,000 tons perweek in August as against 90,000 tons per week in July.     The tentative import programme for November-February, 1940/41 provides for average weekly importsof 130,000 tons,&apos; Reserve stocks of wheat and flour increased from 14*3 weeks&apos; supply atthe end of July to 16.0 weeks1 supply a month later.     Stocks of flour at theend of August, including reserve stocks and millers&apos; -working stocks, and estimated stocks in the hands of bakers and retailers, amounted to 7.9 weeks&apos;supply (compared to 7*7 weeks&apos; at end of July); they are widely dispersed.Millers were instructed on September 12th to operate their plants the maximum number of hours per week and to store the extra output of flour away from thevulnerable areas; the proportion of total stocks held as wheat at the ports is thus being reduced.The new home crop has been safely garnered; it is estimated at 1,555,000tons - a reduction of 115,000 tons from the previous estimate.   Including thenew home-crop, total stocks   of wheat and flour (as wheat) on 31st August were3,821,000 tons.The &quot;at farm&quot; price prescribed for home-grown millable wheat is 14/6dper cwtjthis is the same price as the &quot;standard price&apos; under the Wheat Acts and nodeficiency payments&apos; will therefore be made during the current cereal year. Theproportion of their purchases of wheat (resales, of seed wheat excluded) which maybe used by approved buyers and flour millers for feeding purposes has been reducedto 25 per cent and will be reduced to 10 per cent on 1st October.   Farmers may usewheat, of their own growing for feeding to their own stock.The &quot;at farm&quot; prices and the marketing of home grown rye said home grownthreshed peas   are now controlled.Bread.   The restriction of retail deliveries of bread with a view to reducing distribution costs is being considered.   The Director of Costing&apos;s reporton bread has been completed. .....ANIMAL FEEDS.Maize    Barley      0ilcake3&apos;000   tons total U.K. stocks on August 31st 298      1,288 243Estimated total weekly consumption(including brewing and industrial uses)in September 30 25 21Imports of maize, barley and oilcakes (at 191,000, 42,000 and 24,000 tons respectively) in August were substantially below programme, and were, with theexception of oilcake which was 26,000 tons lower, approximately&apos;the same as in July.The August-September arrival programme for U.S. maize (of which at the end of july the Ministry held 430,000 tons in the U..S.&apos;) was 365,000 tons, but only 141,000 tonsof this are now counted upon.Home produced oilcakes.    The average&apos; weekly output has fallen from 26,000 tons inJune to 16,000 tons in August..  Plant with a capacity of 800 tons per week was destroyed in London by air attack early in September.   Production is expected to recover to.an average weekly rate of about 20,000 tons in September-Octoberprovided (a) that productive capacity damaged in air raids (400 tons per week) can besickly repaired and (b) that no further damage or unusual loss of time occurs,The lack of storage space for oil which necessitated the return to a normal insteadQf a 7 day working week in crushing plants, the time lost on account of air raids^d the fact that August is the usual month for plant repairs, were the principalfactors in this declines ,3.
Releases of oilcake for consumption which were at k.0% of datum - one-twelfth of1938/39 supplies - during August, have &quot;been increased to 60% of the same datum inSeptember and will be further increased to &quot;]0% in October,.   Releases of imported-cereal feeds were, in August-Sept ember, at k1% of datum; the percentage to be released in October-November will depend on arrivals.Stocks. On August 31st,. total stocks of concentrated feeding-stuffs, including thenew home crops, were over 4 million tons. Of these, only about half a million werein port districts. Of the estimated stocks of oilcakes, however, over 50% was inport districts. At the same date, stocks of oilseeds, which are largely at the ports, amounted, to 160,000 tons in terms of oilcake.If the Ministry&apos;s total second year of v/ar arrivals programme of foods andfeeds (l8,9 million tons) is fully implemented (i. e0 assuming that initial loadingsequal programme arrivals and that all losses at sea are offset by additionalloadings) and if no serious losses are sustained in the U.K. from enemy action,supplies of concentrated feeding-stuffs for the twelve months September-August,1940/41 should amount to 6.8 million tons of Starch Equivalent and 1.2 million tonsof Protein Equivalent.     This quantity is only slightly less than the supplies available in the first year of war, and, in terms of Starch and Protein Equivalents12$ and 16% less respectively than in the pre-war period.     Although livestockpopulation has shown little reduction to date (even in the case of pigs and poultry)!the available grazing is at least 1Q% below pre-war and may be further reduced bymore ploughing up.     The 1940 hay crop is 3% and the root and green fodder crops2% to 3% below the pre-war level.Rationing of Feeding-StuffsThe Trade has been reminded that priority in the distribution of feedconcentrates is still in force for cattle and sheep.     Pig and poultry producershave been warned to expect in October a reduction of their supplies of imported and home-grown concentrates to 33% of the pre-war level and advised to adjust theirherds &apos;accordingly.     Nevertheless, it may prove necessary to introduce a detailed scheme for the rationing of feeding-stuffs to livestock.A technical Committee appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture is working on the,details of a rationing scheme and officers of the Ministry of Pood haveassisted.     The Committee&apos;s scheme when ready will be considered by the animal feeding Stuffs Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Food.     A rationing schemeappears to be becoming more necessary since by no other means can the priorities to different classes of livestock be assured or adequate provision made for the changes j;in the stocking of farms which are now becoming marked.4.   OILSEEDS AND NUTS. VEGETABLE AND MARINE OILSOilseeds     Vegetable    WhaleOil Oil&apos;000 tons total U.K. stocks on 31st August -     309 84 296Estimated U.K. weekly consumption (September) 35 &apos; 16 2.8Imports of oilseeds were on a smaller scale in August than in recent months,!but the quantities crushed were also;. reduced and stocks increased by 45,000 tons.    IImports of vegetable oils were maintained and were sufficient to offset the reduced home output of oil.. Little change has occurred recently in the allocation of oils to trade usgrsi,LiJ&amp;seed oil is being allocated on the basis of a 100 per cent, of pre-war requirements; the soap trade receive 80 per cent, of their pre-war usage but they ihave been able to obtain large quantities of imported tallow; the cake and biscuit jand synthetic cream trades receive 80 per cent, of their pre-war consumption, while Ithe oocoa and chocolate and ice cream trades obtain 71 per cent, of their pre-war irequirements. Allocations to margarine and compound lard manufacturers have been Iincreased as an increase in the stocks of these commodities is desired.The c.i.f. prices paid for oilseeds and nuts have been relatively stable forjsome months, a reduction in the prices paid overseas being offset by increasedfreight rates,
5.   I-.IARGARINE AND LARDPrior to the intensification of air attacks considerable progress had beennade in increasing the stocks of margarine and compound lard.       It was intended tocreate a six weeks&apos; stock of each commodity.     In the ca.se of compound lard, this level was reached by 31st August and margarine stocks v/ere then sufficient forthree weeks V requirements.       The margarine factory at Purflee&apos;t; which normally,produces about one-third of the country&apos;s total supply, has since been damaged by enemy air action and production reduced.     Experiments have, however, been made inthe manufacture of margarine in ice crean factories and two of these are expectedto have an output capacity of 2,000 tons   a week, one of which will commenceproduction during the week ending 21st September.     Additional expansion of margarine stocks is now unlikely and further damage to plant would make itdifficult to maintain the output required to meet current consumption.6.   MEAT(imported only)Total G.B, stocks on 31st August 138,000 tons estimated weekly consumption (September)-.       18,000     &quot;Imports and stocks.   During nugust imports plus home killings roughlybalanced consumption.     Heavier arrivals are. expected.In September and, althoughimports are likely to be lower in October and November, it has been decided toincrease the ration temporarily from Is. lOd. to 2s. 2d.Negotiations are in progress with Australia, New Zealand and theArgentine for supplies during the second year of war.     Discussions will be openedwith other South American countries as soon as quantities have been agreed with theDominions.Marketings of home killed grass fed cattle have been heavy in recent weeks.    The poor condition of pastures and the shortage- of feeding-stuffs have both accentuated the usual seasonal increase.     Releases of imported meat fromcold store are being reduced and experiments are being made in supplying home-killed meat to the Forces.   On 16th September the Ministry instructed their local officers to accept only 80$ of the entries of fat cattle and sheep at collectingcentres.   Even if similar restrictions are continued, it is estimated that suppliesof fat cattle during September-November will be 21$ and of sheep, and lambsabove the pre-war normal.The distribution of estimated consumption (excluding offal) for August(4- weeks) was:&apos;000 tonsFighting Services 16.9Manufacturers &quot; - . 12.8Caterers . 8.0Civilians (&amp;) on ration 115.7(b) pork 6.A159.8With a view to reducing abuses of - the rationing system, Deputy MeatAgents have been instructed, to investigate all cases where butchers purchase morethan 80$ of the quantity shown on their buying permits.     The Enforcement Branchare initiating a series of prosecutions against butchers for infringing the rationing regulations.       These-regulations are now under review&apos;by the Ministiy&apos;sCommittee on the Revision of Rationing Forms and Documents.The 25,000 tons of corned beef purchased.&apos; to increase stocks should all have arrived by the end of October, whilst a further 16,000 tons are expectedto arrive in November-December,
Stocks of corned beef at end of August amounted to 73-000 tons.   If the expected imports materialise and if stores are not damaged or heavily drawn upon for emergency feeding, it is estimated that by the.end of November there will besufficient corned beef (109,000 tons) to supply 10 million people a ration of1 lb. per week for 24 weeks.7,    BACON AND HAM 1000 tons   .Total G,B. stocks on 31st August 22.6Estimated weekly consumption(September) 7.5Releases during August averaged 8,300 tons per week, but imports plushome production averaged only 7,400 tons per week,   Weekly consumption in Augustwas about 15^ higher than in June.   Stocks have been decreasing at&quot;the rate ofabout 1,000 tons per week,   A slight increase in home production and additional supplies from Canada during September, October and November should maintain stocks at about 25,000 tons, but, after taking into account known and anticipated losses due to enemy action in this country, the stock available is likely to be further reduced and will represent an inadequate reserve.The negotiations for the renewal of the Canadian contract, which expireson October 31st, have been begun and as a preliminary measure it has been decidedto continue imports on the basis of 130,000 tons a year, but that, withoutprejudice to the future, shipments during the first three months shall be at the rateof 170,000 tons a year.   The shortage of labour precludes any further increase inthe output of bacon from home factories, now working well above peace time normal.Pig supplies are at present&quot; ample.     The coming fall in pig prices and the threatenedfurther restriction of feed concentrates have increased pressure on farmers to market.The number of pigs accepted for slaughter is, however, being restricted.In an effort to ease the tight supply position, retail sales of bacon offthe ration have been restricted since August -26th,   Furthermore, wholesalers&apos;indents for supplies (based on the buying permits they hold) for rationed baconare gnly being met up to 95^ of&apos; the maximum permitted quantity.   These measures should promote eoonomy by the retailex- in the handling of bacon and leave less room for abuse of the rationing system.   But these minor savings will not enable thepresent Services and civilian rations to be maintained during 1940/41 unlessimports from&apos;North America continue at the rate of 170,000 tons a year to make good the expeoted deficiency of about 1,000 tons per xveek.   Other possibilities beingexplored are (a) having one baconless week in four, (b) having a child1 s ration(as with meat), (c) reducing Service requirements by 2,5% and (d) decreasing demand by increasing prices.   As a means of reducing bacon consumption, the amalgamation ofthe bacon and meat ration is&apos; impracticable.8.    SUGARTotal U.K. stocks on 31st August 367,000 tons estimated weekly consumption including exports.......   (September) 33,000.    &quot;The consumption of sugar.in August declined considerably, smaller suppliesbeing released for jam making.    Imports, however, were insufficient to coverconsumption and stocks declined.   During the first half of September about 20,000 tons were lost in air raidsc The production of sugar from the home crop is expectedto commence in October.   The quantity taken over up to the middle of September fromcargoes diverted to U.K. ports totalled 110,000 tons.The negotiations for a purchase of 200,000 tons from India are still in abeyance, and, in order not to accentuate the. world surplus problem, no effort willbe made by the Ministry to revive them.The Ministry hopes shortly to purchase an extra 100,000 tons of Java sugarfor shipment in Dutch boats. This will serve the dual purpose of easing the surplusproblem in Java and improving the U,K, stock position.

The prices charged for milk for manufacturing purposes, are, however, being increased as fromthe 1st October.10,   CONDENSED MILKThe quantity of condensed milk distributed to the retail trade is being increased in September by 7$ for full cream sweetened, 3-g$ for full creamunsweetened, and 12$ for machine skimmed.   Including these increases, the supplydistributed is the equivalent of 75$ of normal for full cream sweetened and 50$ of normal for the other two types (normal being the estimated consumption in April-March 1939/40).   -Given the present stock position, and allowing for anticipated arrivalsfrom overseas, the prospects of continuing these rates of release depend on theextent to which whole and skimmed milk will be available to condenseries during&quot;the winter months.   The milk utilisation priorities for these months have not yetteen settled. -    &apos;11.   BUTTERTotal stocks in United Kingdom on 31st August 40,000 tons estimated weekly consumption (September) 5,700   &quot;Imports of butter are expected to be small during September and Octobertut to increase in the winter months,   A considerable depletion of stocks hasoccurred in recent months (bulk stocks declined from 67,000 tons at the end ofApril to 32,000 tons at the end of August) and, were the present ration to bemaintained, a further decrease to 12,000 tons,- i.e. about 2 weeks&apos; supply, wouldQoour by the end of November,Recent losses due to air raids and substantial losses at sea have affected the outlook for increasing the sugar ration.   Until the stock positionis strengthened and the home crop is safely processed, no increase in the rationwill be recommended.9.   MILKThe production of milk during the past few months has been appreciablysmaller than during the same months last year.   During August production was over&amp;f0 less than in August,. 1939,   The consumption of liquid milk in the U.K. during august, 1940 (76.7 million gallons) was 6.5$ (4,6 million gallons) greater than inAugust j, 1939,   For England and Wales the figure was the highest on record sincethe milk marketing scheme began in October, 1933,   The upward movement in consumption is due mainly to the national cheap milk scheme, under which approximately7a million gallons were distributed during August.   The latest figures showing theprogress of the scheme are:
During the period from 22nd July to 2nd September, 1940, when the combinedbutter/margarine ration of 6 ozs./ per head per week operated, the average domestic consumption of butter per head is estimated to have been 4,9 oz.   per week comparedwith about      oz.. under the earlier 4 oz. ration.   This heavy drain on supplies will make it impossible to maintain the present 4 oz. ration, and a reduction ofthe ration to 2 oz.   per head is being made as from the 30th September for a periodof two ox- three months.Attempts have been made. to purchase 10,000 tons of butter from Argentinabut, owing to adverse production conditions, shipment on an appreciable scale is unlikely to begin until October.12.   CHEESETotal stocks in United Kingdom on 31st August 35,000 tons estimated weekly consumption (September) 3,700   &quot;Imports of cheese in August were on an appreciably larger scale than inJuly,   Stocks have been increased by over 10,000 tons and are now greater than atany time since the commencement of the war.   On account of its high nutritionalvalue, special attention was paid to cheese in the preparation of the import programme for the second year of war and arrangements are being made to obtain from overseas 14 per cent more than the quantity imported in the first year of war.Consideration is also being given to the possibility of increasing home productionof cheese.The distribution of cheese to retailers and caterers will be controlledfrom October by means of buying permits issued by Local Pood Officers.13.

During the three months ending 30th September supplies of shell eggs were only about one-half of normal.   They should rise to about two-thirds of the pre-war level during October-December 1940.   Cold store and pickle stocks are, however,expected to decline from 7,000 tons at the end of August to 2,400 tons at the end ofNovember and to be exhausted by the end of December,July-September October-DecemberNormal Pre-war	Anticipated 1940	Normal Pre-war	Anticipated 194056,7     &apos; 2.0 40.7 5,3	Thou  43,7 2.0 0.0 10.7	5and tons 49.3 10.0 34.7 15,3	33.3 6.6 0.0 34,2104,7	56.4   ,    1  109.3		74,1
1941 Supply position the egg position in the new year is not hopeful.   The import programme for the first six months of 1940 is, at 30 thousand tons, only equal to estimatedimports in the last three months of this year.   While the supply of home-producedeggs will increase in the spring, any further restriction of feeding-stuffs topoultry will inevitably reduce output.   The reduction in the supply of home-produced eggs is unlikely to he as large as the decrease in supplies of feedconcentrates would indicate,   producers will make greater use of farm, garden and household refuse.Egg Control schemes the scheme for the control of imported eggs should he in full operationly the end of September,   A substantial number of applications have been made for licences to operate packing stations under the scheme for improving the distributionOf home-produced eggs.   This plan is designed to provide a reasonable proportionof home laid eggs for the larger centres of population and to increase theproportion of supplies reaching the ordinary retailer who has suffered at theiexpense of the caterer.   The scheme for the recovery and sale of egg packing cases,which is now in operation, is to be improved by opening additional depots indifferent parts of the country.Stocks of frozen eggs totalled 10,000 tons at the end of August, ascompared with 15,000 tons a year ago.14.   TEATotal United Kingdom stocks on 31st August 113 million lbs.Estimated United Kingdom weekly consumptionincluding exports (September) 7,4     &quot;        &quot;Imports of tea in August exceeded consumption.   The fall in stocks, whichlhad continued since the beginning of 1940, has been arrested.   A further smalllinorease in stocks is expected in September,   The seasonal arrivals from Indiaand Ceylon should materially improve the position after September,   Crop prospectsLn India and Ceylon   are reported to be good.If forecasts of arrivals materialise, and if damage by air raids is notexcessive, the de-rationing of tea should be possible by the New Year,   -against this are the difficulties being experienced in securing adequate shipping from india and Ceylon;     and the toll of recent air raids, in which over 4 million lbs.of tea have suffered, though some may be salvaged.   Unless the stock positionis ample to cover consumption in the early months of next year, arrangements wouldBleed to be made for further substantial purchases from Java for early 1941 arrivaljif it is decided to de-ration tea.-15*  PRIED FRUITIt is now regarded as impossible to obtain the normal seasonal supplies^ dried fruit for the Xmas trade.   Exchange difficulties have so far precludedtreasury sanction to purchase supplies in the U.S.A.   Greek and Turkish suppliesfi&amp; the Cape cannot arrive in time.   Present forecasts indicate that about 30,000 tonsIPf dried fruit will bo available for the Xmas trade compared with a normalpantity of over 70,000 tons.   Attempts to arrange a subsidized purchase of milk products and dried fruits from the U.S. have failed.   The U.S, Government have informed the Ministry that owing to the present low U.S. price (i.e. only 501 ofIParity&quot;) of dried fruit they are opposed in principle to a subsidy, but that theypuld grant one on any purchases we made above the level of our normal (definedIs 20,000 tons of prunes and 25,000 tons of raisins) imports from the U.S.
16.   RICE&apos;000 tons total U.K. stocks on 31st August 57Estimated weekly consumption (September) 3.0Half the imports in July and August consisted of diverted-cargoes- and total arrivals were more than double programme.     During September-November,however, imports will be appreciably less than programme.     Nevertheless, total stocks at the end of November should equal nearly ten weeks&apos; normal consumption.. As a reserve of food the total quantity of rice held in the country at the endof November (39,000 tons, or the equivalent of only about one-half weeks&apos;requirements of wheat flour) will be negligible.     Rice is nutritious, itcan be stored almost indefinitely without deterioration and it requires noprocessing.      It is, therefore, an Ideal food to carry as a reserve.The suspension of trade with French Indo-China has cut off a majorsource of supply of broken rice.   Purchases of whole rice may be made in Egypt,if freight can be provided.     For political reasons, the Ministry may shortlymake a substantial purchase of rice in Java,17.   POTATOESInsufficient rain adversely affected the growth of potatoes in some parts of the country, but the total crop is expected to be between 4f: and 5 miHiqftons compared with 4.4 in 1939 and the ten year (1929/38) average of 4.1 million tons.     A considerable part of the increased production will be available for human consumption if required.     Additional supplies should also be available for livestock feeding and for the manufacture of dried food for livestock.   Action isbeing taken to augment the supply of seed available for planting in 1941.18.    FISHBritish landings of fish in August 1940 were approximately one-thirdof the August 1939 figures.     If imports of fresh and frozen fish (now more thantwice the pre-war level) are added to British landings, total supplies forconsumption in August 1940 were approximately 45$ of the figure for August of last;year.No further purchases are being made for the time being to increase theemergency reserve of canned fish, but 6,000 tons of Ganadian herrings are beingpurchased for the use of the Forces.The scheme whereby the Ministry took over and piokled surplus herringsat certain Scotch ports was terminated on September 7th as surpluses proved to beso small that it was felt they could readily be dealt with by normal commercialmethods.A comprehensive review /Document F. p. (m)(40)1407 of the. fish supply position has been submitted to the Food Policy Committee by the Minister ofAgriculture.19.    BREWING AND DISTILLINGEstimated Consumption of Barley and Grain in 1940/41. During the comingbrewing year, brewers and maltsters will be allowed to purchase only barley fromthe home crop, with the possible exception of very small quantities of importedbarley which may be required for export beer.     The industry will therefore need to buy sufficient barley out of the present crop to enable it to carry throughuntil malt from the 1941 harvest is available in sufficient quantities;    thismeans until January, 1942.    Approximately 660,000 tons of barley was used forbrewing in 1938/39.     The output of beer during the first year of war was 3$ to4/o lower than during the previous twelve months, but as the use of sugar and maize has been restricted, the total use of barley was probably some 40,000 tonshigher, say, 700,000 tons.     It has been estimated by the Department of customs and Excise that, as a result of the last increase in excise duty, the declinein beer output, as compared with the twelve months before the outbreak of war,will amount to 15$.     At the moment the output of beer is about 10$ lower than
in 1938/39, hut it appears reasonable to anticipate that as a result of theblackout and the earlier closing of public houses during air attack, the declinein production will increase during the winter months.     A decrease of 15% mayhowever, not materialise and to be on the safe side it is assumed, that the amountof beer to be brewed during 1940/41 will be only 10% less than it was during thebrewing year 1938/39.   On this assumption, allowing for continuation of sugarrestriction and the fact that releases of rice (even if supplies of this or othersubstitutes continue to be available for brewing) to brewers do not compensate for the loss of maize supplies, the industry, to carry on from 50th September, 1940to 31st January, 1942 will require to use approximately 870,000 tons of barley.Their stocks on 30th September, 1940 are estimated to amount to 300,000 tons.The estimated requirements of the industry from the current season1 s crop,therefore, will be approximately 570,000 tons, (i, e. between ten and eleven months1usage.)If production of whisky continues to be limited to one-third of thatduring the year ending 30th September, 1939, distillers1 total grain requirementsduring September - August, 1940/41 are estimated to amount to about 90,000 tons.This will comprise some 30,000 tons of Scottish barley required for the Scottishmalt distillers, and about 20,OQ0 tons of barley (imported or home produced) and40,000 tons of other grains, of v/hich a considerable proportion is likely to berye, for the grain distillers.     It should be noted, however, that the President ofthe Board of Trade has urged the. important*tance of increasing the production ofv/hisky during the coming year in order to maintain stocks for exports to dollar countries in subsequent years.     The Ministry of Food requisitioned distillers&apos;stocks of barley in 1940, allocating 5,000 tons to human food, 5,000 tons for animal feeding stuffs, and leaving 2,000 tons in distillers&apos; hands.The United Kingdom 1940 barley crop is now estimated at 1,080,000 tons &apos;(compared, with the 1934-38 average of 770,000 tons) and it is estimated that, ifthe import programme of 450,000 tons barley is fulfilled, the utilisation ofsupplies will be:-&apos;iQOO tons -&apos;- % of totalBrewing 570 37Distilling  . .\ 50 3jPearl and Pot I3arley 55 -   -                  3-!-  Seed 100 7&apos;.. rh                     Livestock Feed 755 491,530       &apos; 1002QP/o of &quot;the feed value of the barley used for brewing is ultimately available for livestock as brewers grains.  --Emergency Brewing and Malting Armigenentso   The manufacture of malt canonly be carried out in maltings-which.are concentrated in several reasonably safedistricts.   Practically -all maltings work full time during the season and there is little reserve capacity.     However., most brewers have some working stocks of malt aridcould, if necessary,, make use of other materials if malt supplies temporarily failed.-Further, brewers, most of whom have some. spare output capacity, have formed themselvesinto groups in areas, and in the event of a brewery being destroyed, others in thesame area will be able to produce and- supply the beer necessary to supply the houses of the brewery company destroyed.     To enable this to be done, stocks of malt heldty maltsters for the account of brewers will be diverted from the destroyed breweryto the brewery or breweries producing the increased output of beer required.20,   STARCHESThe completion of arrangements for the control of starch have taken longer than had been expected and the scheme will not be put into force before 1st November.Negotiations have started for the purchase of maize starch from the U,S.A,from November onwards.     Inquiries are being made into the possibilities ofinoreasing the home production of starch from imported maize.     The plans to reducedollar expenditure by substituting rice starch for itaize starch are dependent upon aEfficient supply .of broken rice which has not yet been assured,
21.     shipping in :-spite of sinkings &quot;amounting to over half a million tons, imports offoods-and feeds in the first year of war were 590 thousand tons in excess of programme of 20.019 thousand tons (excluding 284 thousand tons-.of unrefined whaleoil)0   This &apos;result?-t was made possible by the diversion of cargoes to the extent ofover one million tons in the course of the yearQThe distribution of sinkings and diverted cargoes in the first year of waramongst the major groups of commodities was as followsSinkings       Diverted Cargoes&quot;(Provisional).---thousand tons--------Wheat and PlourPeed Cereals andAnimal FeedstuffsRice, Tapioca, etc.OilseedsOils and FatsSugarMeat and BaconButterCheeseFruit and VegetablesTea and other BeveragesOther Commodities1951101016555446524553242367.201903110.58839 (a)9Total5241,019(a) Including 30r000 tons coffee.Estimated ari-ivals (excluding diverted cargoes) in August amounted to1,559,000 tons compared with 1,282.,000 in July, 1,620,000 in June, 1,856,000 in Mayand 1,848,000 in April.   Arrivals of diverted cargoes were 140,000 tons in Augustcompared with 223,000 tons in July.   In the second year of war diverted cargoes willbe negligiblecTaking the first year of war as a whole, sinkings were equivalent to about-g$ of total imports of foods and feeds.   Sinkings during the three months June- :August, 1940 ( 72,000; 133*000,and 38,000 tons respectively) exceeded 5% of corresponding imports.     Arrivals during September and October are tentativelyestimated at 2,850 thousand tons (including diverted cargoes but excluding probablefurther sinkings and sinkings not yet reported).     This is 300 thousand tons (about10$) less than -y6th of the second year of war import programme of 18.9 million tonsNevertheless, the loading programmes so far agreed with the Ministry of Shipping forthe period up to the end of January 1941 suggest that, unless sinkings (which the -Ministry of Shipping will- endeavour to make good) are heavier than indicated by *.recent events, the imports outlook, while far from favourable, is not critical.-South Coast ports have been served for some time by coastwise shipping from the Bristol Channel.   From 6th September, overseas tonnage for East Coast portshas been diverted to West Coast ports; the cargoes being brought. round to the east coast by coastwise shippingsIncreases in freight rates for liners operating in both tramp and linermarkets have recently been sanctioned, but as the date -they become effective has notyet been fixed, it is not. possible to estimate their effect on food prices.     Thepossibilities of still further increases in both liner and tramp rates cannot be ignored.22.     DAMAGE AND DPSTRUCTION DUEJTO AIR ATTACH.Considerable difficulty has been experienced in ascertaining the quantities of food and feed lost by air attack.   Early reports have indicated thepremises damaged and their contents are known, but in many cases the effects of fire
or the presence of unexploded bombs have prevented verification of losses of stocks.     The .losses reported up to ,15th September total 93,000 tons of whichLondon&apos;s losses accounted for 75 s000&apos;&apos;tons&apos;,mainly on 7th to 9th September whilethe balance was lost, mainly in July and August, in other parts of the country.In addition 39.000 tons are reported to be in damaged stores but the extent.ofthe damage is not yet known.

An order&quot;as been given to the Belgian-Congo for 10,000 tons of edible palm oil.    Inconjunction with the Ministry-of Shipping the Ministry is considering possible^creases of purchases of sugar and tea from the Netherlands East Indies whereDutch shipping is available.24.THE SPANISH PR0BIEMIn view of the desire cf the Foreign Office for the&apos; maintenance of formal British trad.e with Spain, the Ministry&apos;s programme of purchases from thatcountry has been reviewedo     Subject to agreement on prices, the more essential
fruits and vegetables vri.ll &quot;be purchased&apos; in quantities not less than the pre-war-level. -25.   THE CONSUMER. .   -&quot;&apos;Retail Food PricesRetail food price Index (July 1914 s 100)(Ministry of Labour)1?39 1940.........1st July 139 1681st August       .137 1641st September 138 . 166The Ministry of Labour&quot;s Index of Retail Pood Prices rose by 2 points, or about Iqp per cent.,&apos; between August 1st and September 1st.   This rise is the result ofHincreases in the prices of sugar, eggs and fish, partly counterbalanced by somedecrease in the price of potatoes. during September the maximum retail price of oranges has been reduced from i6d. to 5-gd. per pound.   The maximum price of imported cheese has risen from l/- tol/ld. per pound, that of full cream condensed milk by approximately 10%.   An increase!of 6d. per dozen in the maximum price of home-produced eggs and of 3d. per dozen inimported eggs was operative from September 2nd and a further increase of 3d. perdozen of both home-produced and Eire Eggs is anticipated early in October.    The food Iindex will therefore probably show a further advance of. at least three points by.October 1st.IAt currentj prices, the Ministry is losing some  20,00.0 per week on tea: theforthcoming increase in producers&apos; milk prices will increase the cost of producingcondensed milk.    It is probable therefore that the prices of both tea andcondensed milk will have to be raised in the immediate future.During the past months, a new schedule of agricultural prices was announced,to apply to fat cattle from September 9th, 1940, to milk and pigs from September 30th1940, and to the crops harvested in 1941.   The readjustment of prices was intended toencourage the production of those foods needed most, and to yield farmers in theaggregate a rather higher gross income than the old schedule.   Farmers&apos; are- to receivebetter-returns in 1941 than in 1940 for potatoes and sugar beet.   The &apos;maximum prices for oats and feeding barley are to be reduced by Is. per cwt., while the standard price for oats is to be raised from 11s,6d, to 12.6d. per cwt.   The pool prices for milk ,are to be-increased-on the average of the yearby 5fd. per gallon over 1938-9,(a larger rise than was allowed for in July),   Cattle prices are to be adjusted.During July, August and the early part of September, these were fixed at 11% above the.schedule prevailing in June; the new prices are only 8% above the June schedule.   Pigprices, particularly those for porkers, are also to be reduced.   The net effect ofthese readjustments on the Cost of Living Index will depend on the size and allocation of subsidies yet to be decided,RATIONING- - .      -v.-&apos;The commodities now (September 21st) rationed to individuals are:-per head per week^eat     . v - VlOd. worth (say 1* to if lbs.)

These and other commodities as well, are also rationed, to manufacturers and caterers (except in the case of tea).With a view to reducing the burden on Pood Control Offices and retailers,a Committee is considering the simplification of rationing forms and documents.ffiMKRQENCY FEEDING-Air attacks have caused some temporary difficulties in rationing and food distribution and have of course increased the burden on the local Food ExecutiveOffices in affected areas.     The needs of the people have, however, been met.Retailers Mutual Assistance Facts are apparently working smoothly, where they havebeen put into operation to cope with temporary closing of shops due to air raid,damage.     The Public Assistance Authorities are responsible for the provision of free meals to refugees in Emergency Rest Centres, and. the Ministry of Food&apos;arrangements for supplying these Authorities with the necessary food have, so far,functioned reasonably well.     Further arrangements are being made to supply thei demand for hot drinks such as soup.   There have   been considerable movements ofI population from East Ham, West Ham, Barking and Poplar towards Essex and theGreater London Boundaries, but the Public Assistance Authorities, with the aid ofI the Divisional Food Officers, have been able to meet the needs of the people.IIn general, it has not yet been necessary to draw upon the reserves of non-;perishable food held in the Ministry&apos;s Buffer Depots.     Supplies of corned beef&apos; have, however, been released to retail butchers whore gas mains have been put out offaction, or where, for other reasons, households have no cooking facilities.GDISJUNAL FEEDINGThe Ministry has appointed a Director of Communal Feeding.I Investigations are proceeding to select suitable sites for two Experimental; National Kitchens.    The Local Authorities in London, Liverpool and other large;.. towns have agreed to set up communal feeding centres on a paying basis.   One such^centre &quot;Is already operating in Bradford and other towns are expected shortly to^provide communal feeding facilities.     Urgent attention is being given to theIprovision of hot meals in districts in the Greater London Area where the supply ofIgas or electricity has been interrupted.EOOD EDUCATION CAMPAIGNThough somewhat hampered by air raids, this campaign continues,. Maternity and child welfare clinics, health visitors and district nurses are allco-operating, through the Public Health Authorities, to make the campaign a success.Experiments with the Ministry&apos;s modified Oslo Meal are now in progress orjteing started at 25 factories; in one factory where heavy work is being done antattempt is being made to measure the effects of the Oslo Meal on the productivity of the workers.     A survey of the meals normally fed in works canteens hasdemonstrated the nutritional superiority of the Ministsy&apos;s menu (which now includesH hot dish).pBLIC RELATIONSPublic Relations work is being continued in this country,     Abroad,jpowever, there appears to be a widespread view, particularly in America, that theinhabitants of this country are extx^emely short of food.     The Ministry of food is therefore arranging to give the widest publicity in America to the fact that no[ 0Re in this country need be short of food and. that the sending of gifts isHpiecessary,

REPORT ON FOOD PRODUCTION.(By the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in conjunction with the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for the Hone Department.)(September 15th, 1940)Notes on Crop Conditions, etc.In England and Wales com and hay crops have in general been harvested inexcellent condition.     Potatoes and hops are healthy crops but green fodder is in need of rain.     Pastures have been and are abnormally bare, and milk yields have decreased, but the condition of cattle and sheep continues satisfactory.Harvest operations have also proceeded satisfactorily in Scotland.    the milk yield has been better maintained than in England and livestock are doing -well.Harvesting in Northern Ireland is nearly completed and has taken place under favourable conditions.Milk Production in the United Kingdom.(Million Gallons)Liquid        Manuf ac turing      TotalAugust, 1938 70.6 44.3 114.9&quot;      1939 71.7 52.4 124.2July, 1940 76.0 43.3 119.3August, 1940 76.5 36.3 /  112.8The comparatively low figure for August, 1940, is due almost whollyto drought.1940/41 Ploughing up Programme.County War Agricultural Executive Committees in England and Wales havenow been informed of the minimum ploughing up tasks expected pf them, amounting toabout 1,450,000 acres in England and Wales.     The Scottish and Northern Irelandquotas are each 250,000 acres.     Committees have also been asked to concentrate on increasing particularly the acreages of wheat and potatoes, together with beans andother fodder needed for the milk supply.     The potato acreage envisaged in Englandand Wales is 696,000 acres, an increase of 160,000 over 1940.Reports from the Ministry&apos;s Local Officers and from County War AgriculturalExecutive Committees indicate that the agricultural prices for 194Q/41 announced onAugust 30th have caused considerable disturbance in agricultural circles.     Fear is expressed lest they have some adverse effect on the food production campaign now beginning.The 1940/41 &quot;dig for victory&quot; programme recently announced contemplates anincrease of a half million extra allotments in England and Wales in addition tofurther production of vegetables in gardens, etc.labour of the agricultural unemployed (totalling 9,000 in mid-August of whomwerer.work..5,800 were men) only about 1,500 remained unemployed for more than a month during thev -summer.     Nearly one half of these were considered to be unsuitable for agriculturalThe deficiency of labour for hop picking has been largely made up by an^creased recruitment from East London together with other measures arranged inconjunction with the War Office and the Ministry of Labour./in
In Scotland the labour position is generally satisfactory, but lack of housing accommodation and the inability of crofters to pay for hired labourpreclude advantage being taken of supplementary labour schemes in certain areas ofthe North and West including the IslandssIn Scotland the increases in wage rates recently made are still receivingconsideration with a view to minor adjustmentsoCreditIn order to improve the credit facilities offered to farmers by the banks,an arrangement has been made with the clearing banks under which they have appointedrepresentatives in each county of England and Wales who will be available for consultation with the County War Agricultural Executive Committees and who will deal with complaints as to difficulties in obtaining credit reported to them bythe Committees.     The scope of the Agricultural Requisites Assistance Scheme hasalso been enlarged.Animal HealthApart from three recent outbreaks in Yorkshire the country is at thepresent time free from foot-and-mouth disease, but the swine fever figure, alreadyhigh, has further increased...Mis cellane ousFurther steps have been taken through War Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees to increase the use of swill for stock feeding.   Particular attention isbeing given to the maximum utilisation of swill from London.The acreage of flax in the United Kingdom this year represents nearly a threefold increase over 1939.In Scotland possession has been taken for; purposes of stocking of asporting estate of 36,000 acres*1940 Production Forecastss United Kingdom.
