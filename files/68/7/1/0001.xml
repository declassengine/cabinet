Printed for the War Cabinet.  July 1940.SECRET.W.P. (R.) (40) 181.July 19, 1940.WAR CABINET.REPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE 1940 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES, PROTECTORATES and mandated TERRITORIES.(Previous Reports : Paper No. W.P. (R.) (40) 164.)THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.1. General Position.ON the 18th June the Prime Minister announced in the Canadian House ofCommons the intention of the Government to introduce a Bill authorising the mobilisation of all Canada&apos;s resources, human and material, for the prosecution of the war. This will include provision for national registration of man-power,but compulsory mobilisation would apply only for service within Canada; a department of National War Service will be set up to co-ordinate all voluntarywar activities. According to subsequent press reports, the Bill was passed by both Houses in record time. ________As a result of the death of Mr. Norman Rogers, Canadian Minister for national Defence, Mr. Ralston, the Minister of Finance, was selected for appointment to the former office.A Bill amending the Dominions Election Act, 1938, was read for the first time on the 24th May. This makes members of both the Communist and Naziparties in Canada ineligible for election to Parliament.The new Governor-General, the Earl of Athlone, was installed on the21st June.2. Naval. Military and Air Activities.The four Canadian destroyers mentioned in the previous report were sentimmediately to this country. One of them, H.M.C.S. Frazer, was recently lost inthe Gironde estuary.Developments in France necessitated considerable readjustments as regardscertain aspects of Canadian military co-operation. The move of the SecondCanadian Division to this country was postponed, three battalions from this division being sent to Iceland. Very recently the decision to send further forces from Canada to Iceland was reversed, and the Second Canadian Division is nowto be concentrated in the United Kingdom in the near future, Canadian troops in iceland being for the most part relieved as practicable. An infantry battalionhas also been sent from Canada to Newfoundland, but the requests for a second[21543] &apos; copy No.
battalion for the West Indian area and for transportation units have been withdrawn, while the number of forestry units which Canada was asked to send to Europe have been substantially reduced.The Canadian Government have sent to England a second Army Co-operationSquadron and a Fighter Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force. The air training Scheme is being developed according to programme, despite a reduction,in consequence of the needs of the defence of the United Kingdom, in the numbersof training aircraft which can be made immediately available from this country.The Canadian authorities have made arrangements on behalf of the AirMinistry to examine United States candidates for the Royal Air Force.The Canadian Government have also taken certain steps to ensure the integrity of Greenland and the maintenance of the supplies of cryolite from thatsource.3. Economic Action.Revised arrangements for United Kingdom munitions purchases in Canadaare being put into effect by which orders are being placed directly through theCanadian Department of Munitions and Supply.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.4. General Position.Mr. Beasley, who organised the non-Communist Labour Party in New SouthWales, has been recognised as the Leader of the new party in the Federal Houseof Representatives. The policy of the main Australian Labour Party wasreviewed at an inter-State conference on the 19th June. The Conference passed a resolution advocating complete participation in the Empire Air training scheme, the reinforcement of Australian troops abroad, and the maintenance of compulsory military training. This policy abandons the long-standing opposition of Labour to compulsory training, and endorses the recent declarations ofMr. Curtin, Leader of the Labour Opposition in the House of Representatives.The Conference, while it rejected proposals for participation in a national government, urged that all the resources of the nation should be placed under government control, and declared Australia&apos;s complete and indissoluble unitywith the Allies. Later reports indicate that the Bill introduced by the PrimeMinister (Mr. Menzies) on the 21st June for an amendment of the national security Act, giving the widest powers for the control of persons, services and property described by Mr. Menzies as the &quot; greatest delegated authority in herhistory,&quot; was passed through the House of Representatives in record time. TheLabour Opposition supported the Bill.  The Bill is now before the Senate.5. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.The Commonwealth Government have placed a third cruiser of the royal australian Navy (H.M.A.S. Australia) at the disposal of the Admiralty, and a fourth cruiser is moving to Cape Town for convoy services. An armed merchant cruiser and two sloops have also been placed at the disposal of the Admiralty.The third contingent of the second A.I.F. arrived in the United Kingdom onthe 16th June; two further contingents, of approximately 30,000 each, will beready to leave Australia by the end of August and the end of Decemberrespectively, and the question of their destination is under consideration. TheGovernment have also decided that, in addition, the home defence force must bemaintained at a strength of 250,000 men. Recruiting in Australia is at the rateof 30,000 a month. Two Australian forestry companies are on their way to thiscountry.6. Economic Action.The manufacture of munitions is being speeded up.Further restrictions on non-sterling imports have been introduced as fromthe 1st July, and plans for the rationing of petrol are now under considerationby the Commonwealth Government. Measures to reduce newsprint consumption by about one-third came into force in June.
NEW ZEALAND.7. General Position.Parliament was opened on the 30th May. The Opposition rejected theGovernment&apos;s proposal for a Joint War Council and pressed for a coalition government. Though the country generally was dissatisfied with the war effort,the Prime Minister was at first unwilling to yield. On the 16th July, however,Mr. Fraser announced that agreement had been reached in regard to theformation of a War Cabinet, consisting of himself, two members of the existing government and two members of the Opposition. The War Cabinet will controlNew Zealand&apos;s war effort and its decisions will be conclusive. The generalCabinet will continue to function in the usual way in regard to all other matters.Previously, the following measures had been announced by the Government on the18th June:  (a) The  formation  of a  War  Council  which  is  intended  to  include representatives of  the Opposition,  employers,  trade  unions  andfarmers.   (The Opposition have not yet nominated members.)-   (b) Compulsory service for all persons of 16 years, or over.(c) Travel restrictions in order to conserve manpower.   (Permits for menfit for service desiring to leave New Zealand permanently are to be refused.)(d) Control of industry and businesses.(e) Extensive financial powers are to be sought.Regulations as at (b) (c) and (d) were made under legislation passed on the31st May, on the lines of the United Kingdom Emergency Powers Defence Act,1940.The New Zealand Parliament, in a secret session on the 10th July, passedunanimously a resolution, moved by the Prime Minister and seconded by the leader of the Opposition, expressing the firm intention of the Dominion to devoteevery effort, and to utilise every available resource to assist the Mother Countryin the great struggle now proceeding.8. Naval, Military and Air Activities.The second echelon of the New Zealand Special Force arrived in the UnitedKingdom on the 16th June. The third echelon with reinforcements (totalling9,000 men) will be ready to leave New Zealand at the beginning of August. Oneforestry company arrived here with the second echelon, and the New zealand government have now agreed to provide two further companies and two armytroop companies of engineers; these units are ready to sail as soon as suitabletransport arrangements can be made.Since the outbreak of war over 5,000 men have applied for flying training and 5,000 for non-flying training in the Air Force.9. Economic Action.Further restrictions on petrol consumption, designed to limit private carsto a maximum mileage of 150 miles a month, came into force at the end of June.Measures to reduce the consumption of newsprint are now under consideration.Negotiations are proceeding between the Ministry of Food and the NewZealand authorities for the bulk purchase of New Zealand butter, cheese andother agricultural products during the second year of war.[21543] b 2
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.10. General Position.The Prime Minister has re-affirmed the Union&apos;s determination to take partin the struggle with Germany &quot; fully and to the end.&quot; He drew attention tothe danger of political divisions, and again condemned the subversive aims ofGeneral Hertzog&apos;s minority party. There are signs that the moderate elements in the Opposition are being &apos;&apos; squeezed &apos;&apos; by the extremists and dissensionundoubtedly exists among the Opposition parties. At the same time, there is some tendency on the part of the Prime Minister&apos;s own supporters to deprecatehis &quot; rush tactics &quot; in dealing with legislation.General Hertzog and Dr. Malan, the Opposition leaders, were reported onthe 25th June to have issued a joint statement demanding the immediatesummoning of Parliament. They invited their supporters to protest againstthe declaration of war with Italy and to demand the immediate withdrawal ofthe Union from the war.The Electoral Laws Amendment Act has been passed. The Act seeks to adjust electoral inequalities as between town and country districts.11. Naval, Military and Air Activities.The total strength of the forces is now 82,000, of whom 71,000 have taken the oath to serve &quot; anywhere in Africa.&quot;Units of the Union Brigade Group destined for East Africa, including a portion of the General Headquarters and Divisional Staffs and 3 HowitzerBatteries have arrived in Kenya; the main body is due to reach Mombasa onthe 16th July. Bomber and fighter units of the South African Air Force arein East Africa and have been engaged in active operations. The UnionGovernment have taken over all military medical services in Kenya.The Union Government are prepared, if this should appear practicable, to despatch a small mission to Madagascar to establish contact with the local administration with a view to stimulating resistance to attempts by the enemy to gain control.12. Economic A ction.The closure of the Mediterranean has made it necessary to look to SouthAfrica for part of the iron ore supplies needed for essential war purposes inthe United Kingdom, and arrangements are in hand for the shipment of up to40,000 tons a month.The Union Government have asked that the whole of the South African woolclip may be purchased by the United Kingdom on the same terms as thosearranged with the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand, and the matter is now under discussion with the Union authorities.EIRE.13. General PositionIt is clear that the Government of Eire have fully realised the likelihood of a German invasion, and they are clearly making such efforts as are possible from their limited resources to enable them to meet such a danger. They havenot, however, been willing, despite further pressure brought upon them, to take any further steps in advance towards co-operation with this country, and stillapparently hope that by the preservation of an attitude of neutrality they maybe able, on the one hand, to secure unity of opinion within their own population,and, on the other hand, possibly to avoid an actual landing by Germany. Thereis some evidence to suggest that the French collapse has led to a defeatist feeling among, at any rate, some members of the Government.14. Economic A ction.It has not been possible to make any further progress with the trade negotia-tions referred to in the last report.
NEWFOUNDLAND.15. General Position.Canada has sent a battalion of troops and a flight of five planes to guardthe airport and the air base at Botwood.In order to reduce the calls upon the United Kingdom exchequer, theGovernment of Newfoundland has issued a war loan of 1,500,000 dollars, the proceeds of which will be applied to the service of the Newfoundland sterling debt.Considerable reductions are being made in expenditure in the estimates for 1940-41, which, together with additional taxation, will reduce the amount required by way of grant-in-aid to approximately $2,500,000 as compared withan original estimate of $4,000,000.16. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.(i) The Navy..The 7th Contingent (175 men) arrived on the 3rd June. The 8th Contingent(195 men) are due in the United Kingdom immediately.(ii) The Army.The 3rd and 4th Contingents, numbering about 330 men together, areen, route. When they arrive, they will be drafted to a 2nd Newfoundland HeavyRegiment, Royal Artillery (the 59th).(iii) The Royal Air Force.A Proclamation calling for volunteers for training in Canada as pilots,air-gunners, &amp;c, has been issued.17. Legislative Action.Nil.18. Economic A ction.Steps have been taken to persuade Newfoundland loggers now in the UnitedKingdom not to leave their work on the expiry of their terms of engagement.Arrangements have been made for bringing over 1,000 more loggers bybatches. The first batch of 200 is due immediately. Newfoundland are willing tosupply a considerable further number if required.200 deck hands recruited in Newfoundland for service in the mercantilemarine have arrived in the United Kingdom. Crews have also been supplied fortwenty-four merchant ships at Canadian or United States ports.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.19. Legislative Action.The Southern Rhodesia Government have passed conscription legislation onthe lines of the United Kingdom National Service (Armed Forces) Act, to give them full control of man-power in the Colony. The age-groups from 18-40 havebeen called up.20. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.The first of the Flying Training Schools which are to be established in southern Rhodesia was opened in the middle of June, and consideration is being given to a proposal that the scheme should now be extended to include oneObservers&apos; School, a 4th Elementary Training School and a 4th Training School.
21. Economic Action.Arrangements have been made for the whole of Southern Rhodesia&apos;sexportable surplus of citrus and maize to be taken by the United Kingdom.Steps are being taken to ensure the maximum production of chrome ore forexport to this country.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.22. Political Situation.When the collapse in France occurred the Governor-General took steps toobtain through the Governors brief periodical reports from all quarters of thecountry of the effects upon the Indian public. These reports indicate generalbewilderment and some depression and nervousness as to the nearing possibility that India may actually become subject to attack. There has been, however, nopanic, though in some places there has been a tendency towards unusually heavywithdrawals from the Post Office Savings Bank, but nowhere anything in thenature of a run on the Banks in the cities. There was evidently general reliefwhen it was made clear that Britain intended to fight to the end.As might be expected from these reactions, the widespread desire for a truce to end the present political deadlock has been much accentuated, and at the close of the month the Governor-General saw Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnahseparately as the first step towards ascertaining whether something concretecould not be done, if only provisionally. I shall be bringing shortly before theWar Cabinet the results of these interviews, the accounts of which I have notyet had time to consider. Meanwhile, it will suffice to say that no departure bythe Congress leaders is apparently to be expected from the full rigidity of their demands as the price of co-operation, but that the Moslem League, at all events,is prepared to be a party to full co-operation both with the Central and provincial governments.I should pei-haps add that early press reports of the effect of a recentresolution by the Congress Working Committee as to its attitude towardsMr. Gandhi&apos;s doctrine of non-violence as applied to dealing with external aggression were misleading in so far as they suggested that the resolution was intended to indicate co-operation with the British Government.23. Military Affairs.1. His Majesty&apos;s Government have asked the Government of India toprovide a third Indian Battalion for Aden. This Battalion is required as areserve in the hands of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to be availablefor use in Aden, Somaliland or elsewhere. The Government of India have agreed and propose to despatch the Battalion to Aden on about the 14th July.2. At His Majesty&apos;s Governments request, the Government of India haveagreed to provide an Indian Cavalry Motor Regiment for the 4th Indian division in Egypt. This regiment is carried in unarmoured trucks and light lorries andhas 35 Light Machine Guns.   It will be despatched to Egypt as soon as possible.3. Three of the four Animal Transport Companies, R.I.A.S.C., which werewith the B.E.F. in France have been safely evacuated to this country. No newshas so far been received of the fourth Company which was serving on the Saar.4. Further orders for ammunition have been received from the Ministry ofSupply, calculated to keep Indian Ordnance Factories and the engineering tradeemployed at their present rate of production till the autumn of 1941.The responsibility for the production of weapons, ammunition andmilitary stores in India, formerly that of the Defence Department, has beentransferred to the Department of Supply, and it is hoped that a fuller utilisation of the resources of India outside the Indian Ordnance Factories will result.
24. Foreign and Frontier Relations.(i) A afghanistan.On the 13th June His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul held a discussion withthe Prime Minister and other Ministers on the questions of military conversa-tions, the supply of armaments and the offer of credits. The interview was veryfriendly, and the Prime Minister started by saying that the attitude of theAfghan Government had in no way altered towards His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand that they were determined to pursue their policy of close friendship withthe British Government through days good and bad. He expressed gratitudefor the gift of rifles, S.A.A. and other equipment, but thought it better not toaccept this until His Majesty&apos;s Government were in a position to supply theirmajor requirements in the matter of armaments, otherwise the arrival of a smallconsignment only might give a bad impression. As regards his earlier proposalto send an officer of the Afghan General Staff to India, he would abide by thewishes of the Government of India, but he doubted, now that the supply ofarmaments was not in question, whether this would serve any useful purpose.The military authorities in Kabul would answer any enquiries, and in suchmatters as the construction of roads he himself was in the best position to advise.The Prime Minister also accepted with gratitude the offer of  2^ million credit and suggested the deputation of some official from Simla to Kabul to discussdetails. He emphasised the seriousness of Afghanistan&apos;s economic position atthe present time, which was due largely to their inability to dispose of theirexportable surpluses of cotton and wool. It was stated that the Afghan Govern-ment required half a million pounds to tide them over their immediate difficulties, and they have asked that His Majesty&apos;s Government should purchasetheir present stocks of wool and cotton immediately, or should, at any rate,advance to them 75 per cent, of the value of these stocks. These suggestions are under urgent consideration, especially as regards a purchase of wool. Thelatest reports from His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Kabul indicate that the Russiansmay arrange a barter agreement with the Afghan Government whereby they willtake Afghan cotton and wool in exchange for petrol, oil and sugar. A barteragreement of this kind will not, of course, relieve the Afghans&apos; pressing needfor foreign exchange, but it would involve an increase of Russian influence atKabul, where the Russians at present appear to be receiving German and Italianbacking.Generally, the situation in Afghanistan is still calm, but there is a generalapprehension that Russia will take advantage of the situation in Europe eitherto enter Afghanistan or to make demands on the Afghan Government with aview to establishing her position firmly in the country with the object of attackingIndia. The position of the Afghan Government itself is not altogether stable.The continued successes of the Germans have had a marked effect, and in the face of German propaganda it is becoming increasingly difficult for them tomaintain their pro-British attitude. At the same time, the economic structure of the country has been seriously disturbed and there is discontent among thepublic and traders at the falling off of trade. The instability of their positionno doubt explains why in his discussions with His Majesty&apos;s Minister the AfghanPrime Minister, though friendly, showed evident reluctance to advertise openlyhis Governments friendly relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government by accepting the Government of India&apos;s proffered gift of rifles and ammunition or by sending a military representative to Simla.(ii) North-West Frontier.Waziristan has remained quiet throughout the month except for minorincidents. In the Ahmadzai Salient there has been no trouble since political control was handed back to the civil authorities on the 24th May. The Frontiergenerally is quiet and some further loyal assurances have been received from certain tribal sections. There have been occasional riots in the Settled Districts,but on two occasions, in Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan, these were successfully resisted by the villagers.(iii) Sinkiang.There has been no further development in the matter of the demand for the closing down of the Consul-GeneraFs wireless. There is a report, believed to bewell founded, of operations against rebels in the Khotan district.
(iv) Nepal.The Maharaj a and Government of Nepal sent special messages of congratulations-tion on the occasion of the King&apos;s birthday. In the course of a special call onour Minister, the Maharaja expressed confidence in ultimate victory, and saidthat Great Britain could count on the full and whole-hearted support of Nepal.(v) Persian Gulf.The French collapse has shocked opinion in Bahrein, where news of theGerman peace terms was eagerly awaited, particularly as affecting Arabiccountries under French control. In Muscat faith in Great Britain is unshaken,and hope is expressed that Islamic countries must soon be rid of Italiandomination.Nothing to report.25. Indian States.26. Economic.Prices.Since February, when the question of prices was last referred to in these reports, considerable changes have taken place. The Calcutta Index of wholesale prices reached its highest point in December at 37 per cent, above pre-war.Examples of individual commodities are ; *Per cent.Cereals and pulses        ...      ...      ...      ...      25Oil-seedsRaw jute ...Raw cottonHides and skinsMetals25128903321It is important to note that both cotton and jute were exceptionally andunduly low last August.The levels reached last December were, with the exception of jute, well below those of the average of the five years preceding the slump of 1930, the figure forall commodities being 137 in December 1939, as compared with an average of148 before the slump.Since the end of 1939 the level of prices and of the cost of living have fallenback considerably. The wholesale price index fell 7 points in January, 4 points in February, 5 points in March; it remained steady in April and fell 4 pointsagain in the following month to 117, or only 17 per cent, above the pre-war level.In April, the latest month for which we have the index numbers for individual commodities, the above list stood as follows as compared with pre-war : CerealsPulseOil-seeds  ...Raw jute ...Raw cottonHides and skinsMetalsPer cent.-1 dj.o61274693022There have been falls since April, and, in particular, the price of Indiancotton in Bombay fell on the 26th June to below the pre-war level.With the exception perhaps of jute, the rise which had occurred by the endof last year was by no means excessive nor unwelcome. In fact, it may be regardedas a recovery, not complete but partial, from the depression of the last ten years,and a continuance of it, if steady and gradual, would probably have done, moregood than harm. The Government of India, while viewing the case of jute and, toa lesser extent, that of cotton with some concern, have taken the view that, onthe whole, the rise of wholesale prices had not at its highest reached the point at which the question of Government intervention and control presented itself asa practical necessity. In this their view undoubtedly coincided with publicopinion and with that of the local authorities, who, though apprehensive inregard to retail prices and the cost of living, stand, on the whole, to gain fromhigher commodity prices.
In the early stages there was a wide-spread tendency for retail prices to riseand fluctuate in a way that began to cause some alarm and to necessitate attention from the point of view of safeguarding law and order. Powers were devolvedupon Provincial Governments, and were more or less effectively used in various ways by some of those Governments. For some months now there has been no evidence that this is at present a serious problem. The working class cost of livingfigures rose gradually up to the end of 1939. By February they had fallensomewhat, and, to take two instances, the index stood that month at 8 per cent,above pre-war in Ahmedabad and at only 7 per cent, in Bombay. At that timethe question of granting compensation to low-paid Government servants wasconsidered in all the Provinces, and the general conclusion was that nothing wasnecessary, as the position still compared favourably with that which prevailedwhen the rates were last fixed. Since then the cost of living has undoubtedlyfallen further. By the end of March the Indian Retail Index figure for Food-grains stood at 12 per cent, above pre-war (as compared with 19 per cent, inDecember); at the same date in the United Kingdom the Ministry of LabourRetail Food Index showed a rise of 14 per cent. Some increases have beenconceded in industrial wages, notably in the Bombay cotton industry, but these have been as much justified by the comparative prosperity of industry as by thecost of living.The cotton industry has been busy with war orders. But the domestic market in cotton piece-goods has not been very active, and this may be taken to indicatethat there has been no substantial increase in the spending capacity of the people as a whole. It is likely that the early effects of the rise in prices have gone largely to the benefit of the middlemen and traders, and what has reached the producersmay have been absorbed in their previous state of indebtedness. Nevertheless, therise has probably served to promote contentment, and pre-occupation with economicactivities, and has tended to damp down political controversy. To the extent thatthe price-level has receded the opportunity of political agitators among theproducing classes has increased. The reverse condition, that is to say, discontentoccasioned by a rise in the cost of living and eased by its fall, applies to thenumerically much less important classes of those with fixed incomes or wages andof those whose livelihood is mainly dependent upon urban occupations and notupon agriculture.The Government of India are holding periodical price conferences at whichthe Provinces and larger States are represented. These have been useful and have enabled the various authorities to correlate their opinions and experiences and toreach general agreement upon certain fundamental matters. In particular, it is agreed that any regulation of wholesale prices which might become necessary ifthe rise reached undesirable heights would be a matter for the Central Govern-ment, and that it was primarily the function of the local authorities to take action with regard to the margin between wholesale and retail prices and to curbspeculation on the part of middlemen and shopkeepers.The fall of commodity prices since the end of last year has led to wide-spreadcriticism and complaint against the Government of India, who have beenunjustifiably charged with pursuing, both in regard to supply and economic warfare, a policy which denies to the producing and trading classes of the countrypart, at any rate, of the benefits claimed as legitimately arising out of theincreased demand for their products in war time. There is evidence of a large volume of opinion to the effect that the policy of India should be actively directed to taking all possible advantage of the war for the purpose of promoting economic prosperity and developing the resources, and, in particular, the industries, of thecountry, regardless of whether such development is required for the prosecution ofthe war or not. This question has been several times debated in the Legislature,and the Government, while taking up a sympathetic attitude towards reasonableclaims and expectations, has declined to accept in its entirety the view summarised in the last sentence and has had no difficulty in justifying its policy. TheCommerce Member, Sir Rainaswami Mudaliar, has taken a leading part inexpounding the &quot;case of the Government, and in the Budget Debate in the Councilof State he made a notable speech, from which the following is worth quoting : &quot; I am certain that, if the Allies lose, we lose all. There can be noquestion of that, and every member realises that loss to the Allies in this war means an utter annihilation of all our hopes, whatsoever those hopes may[21543] c
be and howsoever high or low they may be pitched. I give that merely as a background of the motives which prompted me and the Department withwhich I am concerned in taking certain steps.&quot;27. Finance.War Savings. In a notification, published on the 4th June, the IndianDefence Savings Movement was duly launched, the object being the raising of funds to pay for the expansion of the defence organisation. The issues providedare : Savings Certificates with a life of 10 years and a yield of about 3-gr per cent,compound interest, tax free; 6-year Bonds giving a yield (subject to income tax)of a fraction over 3 per cent.; and a 3-year loan without interest, to accommodatethose who wish to contribute without profit.Provincial Finances. The statement below summarises the Budget estimates of the eleven Provincial Governments for 1940-41. Three Provinces ransubstantial deficits in 1939-40. Of these, Assam and the United Provinces havebudgeted in the current year for small surpluses; but Bengal, with appreciablyincreased expenditure estimates and no new taxation, has budgeted for a deficit of over Rs. 50 lakhs.Provincial Budgets, 1940-41.(Figures in lakhs of rupees.)Province.Ministerial Provinces-Bengal...Punjab...Assam ...Sind    .........Revenue.l,397i1,223*324J400Expenditurecharged to revenue.l,454i1,2011319J398JSurplusC + )4- 21f4-    54    1*or deficit.(-)- 57Section 93 &quot; Provinces MadrasBombayUnited ProvincesBihar ............Central Provinces and BerarN.W.

THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Eleventh Monthly Report submitted by the Secretary of State for the colonies covering the Period June 1 to 30, 1940.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)32. Military Affairs.The entry of Italy into the war has brought certain of the Colonies intothe actual theatre of hostilities. The subsequent collapse of France has also had a direct reaction upon the Colonial Empire and every effort is being madeto ensure that our interests are properly defended. Further details of themeasures taken are given in the following section of this report.In order to co-ordinate the defence of the West African Colonies, Lieutenant-General G. J. Giffard, C.B., D.S.O., has been appointed General OfficerCommanding the forces in that area. He has already arrived in West africa and taken over command.In view of the deterioration of our relations with Spain, a preliminary (Circularwarning telegram was sent to all Colonies on the 23rd June informing them telegramthat the relation of Spain to the &apos;&apos; Axis &apos;&apos; Powers makes her entry into the No- 109)war possible.   It was emphasized that this telegram was not to be taken asthe formal &quot; warning telegram &quot; prescribed in the Colonies&apos; Defence Schemes :but that that telegram might be sent at a later date.   Colonial Governments wereadvised as to the action which would be taken in this country regardingSpaniards.[21543] c 2increased above normal, mainly amongst the Indian Community, which isstimulated by Congress Hindustani broadcasts; but nothing in the nature offinancial panic has been observed.Press and Public Opinion.Public opinion as expressed through the Press is, on the whole, distinctlymore satisfactory than before the collapse of France, to which country it issympathic but critical in comparing it with the expressed determination of holland, Belgium and Norway to continue the struggle. There is emphasis onthe necessity of using the whole Empire&apos;s resources in the increased task before it, and some insistence that some definite promise of Burma&apos;s constitutional advance is absolutely necessary to secure the complete co-operation of Burma.Since the specific demands from Japan in regard to the transport of military supplies to China have been known, opinion has become apprehensive of herintentions of territorial expansion and inclined to emphasise Burma&apos;s lack ofmilitary preparedness to face Japanese aggression; but there is no immediatefear of hostile action by Japan against Burma. Burmese opinion has in recent months hardened considerably in favour of China.29. Defence.A number of proposals for strengthening local defence have been under active consideration in Burma. In present circumstances the improvement possible is determined by local resources, but subject to this limitation good results are being achieved.30. External Relations.Nothing to report other than the Japanese demands referred to above.31. Economic.Nothing to report.
(Secret and personal tele-grams ofJune 6, 1940.)(Secretary ofState to governor,Hong Kong,telegramNo. 312 ofJune 27, 1940.)The Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland have been apprisedof the possibility that in certain circumstances Portugal might find herself forced into partnership with the Axis Powers. They were informed that the Govern-ments of the Union of South Africa and of Southern Rhodesia have been askedto work out preliminary plans to deal with the situation which might, in those circumstances, arise in Portuguese West Africa and Portuguese East Africa.It has, however, been emphasised that at present the situation envisaged is entirely lrypothetical and at the present moment the Portuguese Government isdefinitely pro-Ally.In view of the developments in the Far East it has been decided, in theinterests of the defence of Hong Kong, to evacuate the wives and families ofService personnel and certain civilians, from that Colony. The United StatesGovernment have agreed that the white evacuees should proceed in the first place to Manila and it is proposed that the British subjects among these shall after-wards go on to Australia as and when shipping permits. Certain classes ofevacuees will be sent to Colombo or Madras.The evacuation of the women, children and old men from Gibraltar has been proceeding since the middle of last month and some 13,000 persons have gone to French Morocco. Consideration is now being given to the question whetherthey should remain there or whether they can be transferred to some place of greater safety.It has been decided to introduce legislation in all the four West AfricanDependencies for compulsoiy national service in both civil and militarycapacities. Such legislation will apply to British subjects between the ages of18 and 45, but, while general in character, will in practice be applied only tosuch persons or classes as the Governor may order. It is contemplated that inthe first instance it should be applied only to European British subjects.33. Events following on the French Collapse.As soon as the French Government announced their decision to accept theterms of the German-Italian armistice, His Majesty&apos;s Consular representatives in French overseas territories were instructed by the Foreign Office to get in touchwith the local French authorities, urging them to continue the war with us in spiteof the debacle in metropolitan France, and offering them the support of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the following terms : &quot; Until such time as a free independent and constitutional authority has been re-established on free French soil we shall do everything in our power to maintain the integrity and economic stability of all French overseas territories provided they stand by us. We further guarantee that these territories will be provided with funds to cover the payment of the salaries and pensions of all civil and military officials throughout the French OverseasEmpire who are prepared to co-operate with us.&quot;In all parts of the world where British and French overseas territories arecontiguous our Colonial Governors have been in touch with the French colonialauthorities. In the more distant parts of the French Empire the response hasbeen favourable. The French authorities in the Western Pacific have declaredthat they will refuse to obey any orders received from Bordeaux, and have informedour High Commissioner that they are willing to maintain the status quo in theNew Hebrides Condominium. In the West Indies, the French Governor ofGuadeloupe has informed the Governor of Trinidad in similar terms, and measures of close economic co-operation between the two islands have been initiated. The Governor of Trinidad has also visited the French High Commis-sioner for the West Indies at Martinique, but the latter&apos;s attitude is apparentlynot favourable.On instructions the Governors of Nigeria, Gold Coast and Sierra Leone have sent civil and military Liaison Officers to the adjacent regions of French west and Equatorial Africa, with the object of making contact with the local french authorities and encouraging them to continue the war in association with us andto remain in control of their territories on the basis of the offer by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment quoted above. The most favourable response has been in the cameroons, where the French Governor-General has publicly announced his intention to stand firm and maintain the integrity of the territory in close co-operation with the Government of Nigeria.   It is thought that he would even
w,/elcome the assumption of control by His Majesty&apos;s Government. In the subordinate provinces of French West Africa (French Niger, Dahomey, Togoland,Ivory Coast and French Guinea) local opinion, particularly on the part of theFrench military, is favourable, but the civil authorities are reluctant to act independently of the Governor-General at Dakar, who seems likely to throw inhis lot with the Bordeaux Government. In Jibuti, the Governor, under theinfluence of the French General commanding the troops (who acts under theorders of the G.O.C. in C, Middle East) has decided not to yield in spite of atelegram from the French Minister of Colonies ordering him to do so. an indian Battalion has been sent from Aden to act as a reinforcement for thedefence of Jibuti and British Somaliland.French Consuls and residents in many British Colonies, both in East and west Africa, the West Indies, Malaya, Gibraltar and Aden, have visited therespective Governors and announced &quot;their repudiation of the French armistice terms and their desire to continue the war in association with us. In many casesthis message has been coupled with a declaration of adherence to General de gaulle.The Governor of Cyprus was approached by French officers in command of colonial troops (part of the French&quot; Army of Syria) stationed there, who wishedto continue fighting with Great Britain. The Governor has been instructed tocommunicate to the senior French officer who is prepared to follow General de gaulle a message from the latter authorising him to assume command of all french soldiers in Cyprus who are willing to continue fighting and to act in concert with the British G.O.C.(As to Syria, see under Palestine : paragraph 19 below.)34. Release of Colonial Service Personnel for Duty with Fighting Services.Following on a review of the question of the release of Colonial service personnel and of Colonial man-power generally, in consultation with the Serviceand other Departments concerned, a telegram was sent on the 10th June to allColonial Governments informing them that the conclusion reached was that itwould be contrary to the public interest to reduce the efficiency of the colonial service or to deplete potential reserves of man-power in the Colonies by releasingmen for the armed forces in this country, where there is at present no difficultyin obtaining all the men that can be equipped and absorbed in the fighting-services. It was explained that, subject to the exception mentioned below, thefirst duty of all men who could be released from their normal occupations in theColonies was to serve with such local forces as there exist.On the 13th June Colonies were informed that Europeans with Naval orMercantile Marine experience as officers w^ere required for service in the royal navy, and were asked to forward as early as possible particulars of any men inthis category who could be released.In order to provide for the release of additional members of the colonial service for duty with local forces in Africa, arrangements are being made, inconsultation with Governments, to curtail the leave of those men who. are now inthis country and are fit to return to duty.(Secretary ofState&apos;sCirculartelegramNo. 91 ofJune 10, 1940.)(Secretary ofState&apos;sCirculartelegramNo. 96 ofJune 13, 1940.)(Secretary ofState&apos;telegram ofJune 19, 1940.)35. Internment.The question of transferring internees from the United Kingdom to otherparts of the Empire for security reasons has been under consideration, and enquiries have been made of certain Governors as to the possibility of a substan-tial number of internees being transferred to those territories for internmentthere. In the meantime, however, the most dangerous internees and prisonersof war are being transferred to Canada, and the Dominion Government haveagreed to accept all male enemy aliens at present interned.Colonial Governments have been kept informed of the policy being adoptedin this country in regard to the internment of enemy aliens, including Italians.Some 750 Italians were deported from Malta on security grounds in an Italianship, the s.s. Callitea, which was released for the purpose.
36. Exchange Control, Export and Import Licensing.Numerous additional restrictions on trade and financial operations with european countries have been imposed in consequence of the entry of Italy intothe war and the conclusion of an armistice in France. Apart from the automaticcessation of trade with Italy, the most important steps have been the suspension of exports to France and the blocking of French accounts; and the suspension of exports to Switzerland and the Balkan countries. These measures have allfollowed on similar action in the United Kingdom.As part of the general plan of the Treasury to bring all foreign exchangetransactions of the sterling area on to the basis of official sterling, the colonial dependencies have followed the United Kingdom in imposing a strict condition that all exports to the United States must be paid for in dollars or in sterlingbought at the official rate and in making various other adjustments in theirsystems of exchange control.37. Supply of Colonial Products.The general position of Colonial export products has been materiallyworsened by the further spread of the war. The whole of the European markets,which were of considerable importance for most Colonial exports, has nowvirtually been lost. In addition, large quantities of primary products from theNetherlands, Belgian and French Empires are now cut off from their normalmarkets. The problem of disposing of excess supplies of export commodities from the Allied Empires has therefore arisen in a very acute form. The british colonial commodities most affected are oilseeds and nuts and vegetable oils, cocoa,coffee, bananas, sisal and hides and skins; but even commodities which havehitherto been unaffected by the war, such as tea, are also experiencing difficulties as a result of the rapidly moving events of the past month.When we have to add to this loss of. European markets the prospect that imports into the United Kingdom may at any moment have to be very severelycurtailed as a result of further attacks on shipping or ports, it becomes clearthat producers in British Colonies may be faced with destitution, owing to the impossibility of marketing their produce, unless some means is found of giving them relief. The possible measures which might be taken to relieve their difficulties are being reviewed by my Department with the Treasury and otherDepartments concerned.A further aspect of the problem of surplus commodities is also under examination. Normally the United States of America is a large buyer of rawmaterial products from the Allied Colonial Empires, and the possibility of herbuying increased quantities of certain of these products, e.g., for storage in theUnited States until after the war, when they could be used for relief purposes,has been mooted. An interdepartmental Committee formed to consider theproposal decided at its first meeting that, while the time was not ripe for adefinite approach to the United States Government, the details of a plan shouldbe prepared in order that it might be immediately available when circumstancespermitted the start of negotiations with the United States Government. Detailsof the probable surpluses of Allied Colonial products are accordingly beingworked out.Of the Colonial commodities which have not been seriously affected by the lossof European markets the most important are rubber and tin. These commodities are fortunately in increasing demand in the United States, and plenipotentiariesare at present in Washington negotiating with the United States Government forbulk purchases of these commodities.38. Shipping.The most important problem faced by my Department under this head during june was the question of maintaining supplies to Dependencies affected by theoutbreak of war with Italy. The Dependencies principally affected wereGibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Palestine, Aden and Somaliland. The food situationin these Dependencies is in the main satisfactory, although Palestine and Adenmust have some continuance of supplies from the East.   I understand that the
REPORTS ON PARTICULAR COLONIES.40. Tanganyika Territory.Compulsory National Service. A telegram has been addressed to theGovernor of the Tanganyika Territory stating that the entry of Italy into thewar and the grave events of the past week have transformed the entire militarysituation in Africa, and that it therefore appears to the Secretary of State thatthe time has come for Tanganyika, like other British Dependencies in tropical africa, to introduce legislation providing for compulsory national service of botha civil and a military character. The Governor was requested to give the matterhis early consideration and, if he sees no strong objection, to proceed with thenecessary legislation as soon as possible.The new legislation would apply to British subjects and British-protectedpersons between the ages of 18 and 45; and while general in character would, inpractice, be applied only to such persons or classes of persons as the Governormay order.41. Northern Rhodesia.War Gift. As already announced, His Majesty&apos;s Government has gratefullyaccepted an offer by the Northern Rhodesia Government to make a gift in 1940of  200,000 towards the cost of the Imperial war effort.Compulsory Military Service. Legislation has been passed making militaryservice compulsory for all British subjects and British-protected persons betweenthe ages of 18 and 45. The legislation is modelled on similar legislation already existing in Kenya and applies to Africans as well as to Europeans and Asiatics.42. Nyasaland.War Gift. As already announced, the Nyasaland Government has offered to make a gift to His Majesty&apos;s Government at the end of each year of the war of the amount by which the Protectorate^ free surplus balances exceed the figure(From Secre-tary of state to Governor,No. 306, Secret,June 25, 1940(42374/40T.T.).)Admiralty are arranging for convoys to be sent from Bombay to Suez, and I amexploring, in consultation with the High Commissioner for Palestine and theother Departments concerned in this country, the measures required to enable thebest possible use to be made of the shipping space available in these convoys forPalestine and Aden requirements. The Governor of Malta reported in the latter part of the month an urgent requirement of 100,000 sandbags; the possibility isbeing explored of supplying these from Egypt.39. Social Services.On the third reading of the Colonial Development and Welfare Bill in theHouse of Commons on the 11th June, Mr. Hall stated that since, in presentcircumstances, purposes of war value must have the first call on the whole of our resources, whether in men, material or money, it would not be possible to proceedwith the programme of Colonial development on the lines previously contemplated.We should, however, not be debarred from providing funds for urgent schemes which can be undertaken with purely local resources in men and materials andwithout detriment to the war effort.These criteria are now also being applied to schemes which had already beenapproved but on which work has not yet started; and certain schemes already inprogress are again being reviewed from this point of view.In his statement in the House, Mr. Hall also announced that, as men of thecalibre needed for service on the proposed Colonial Development and WelfareAdvisory Committee, and on the proposed Colonial Research Advisory Committee,would not now be able to find the necessary time to devote to such work, the setting up of these Committees was being deferred for the time being.
(Telegram fromGovernor,Bermuda,No. 100 ofJune 19, 1940.)(Telegram fromGovernor,Jamaica,No. 282, andfrom Governor,Bahamas,No. 49.)(Telegram fromGovernor,No. 144.)(Telegram fromGovernor,No. 273.)at which they stood on the 1st January, 1939. In accordance with this offer, the nyasaland Government is prepared to contribute an amount of  20,000 in respectof 1939 and a further amount of approximately  30,000 at the end of 1940. this offer has been gratefully accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Compulsory Military Service. Legislation has been passed making militaryservice compulsory for all British subjects and British-protected persons ofEuropean and Asiatic descent between the ages of 18 and 55. The legislation ismodelled generally on similar legislation in Southern Rhodesia.43. West Indies.West India Royal Commission Report.In addition to the selection of an Inspector-General of Agriculture, already announced, it has been decided to proceed with the appointment of the comptroller for Development and Welfare and of his advisers on Public Health,Labour, Education and Social Welfare. I have decided to release my agriculturaladviser, Sir Frank Stockdale, for appointment as Comptroller.Evacuation of School Children to the West Indies.A proposal was made to use Bermuda as a clearing house in connection witha scheme for the reception of British school children in the United States ofAmerica, but this has now been abandoned, at any rate for the present.Offers to receive small numbers of British school children have also been madeby Jamaica and the Bahamas.War Contributions.British Guiana. The residents of Georgetown, British Guiana, havesubscribed  7,000 to a fund for the provision of bombing planes.Barbados. A &apos;&apos; Win the War &apos;&apos; fund has been started and voluntarysubscriptions already exceed  12,000.Jamaica. The people of Jamaica have subscribed  20,000 for the purchaseof a bomber of the latest type.(Telegram from        Bermuda. A sum of  40,000 has been voted by the legislature.   WithNoVe82ir&apos;       contributions from the Corporation of Hamilton and from unofficial bodies, thetotal exceeds  50,000.(Telegram from Windward Islands. The St. Vincent Arrowroot Association have made a governor,       contribution of  5,000 towards the cost of war aircraft.No. 322.)(Telegram fromGovernor,No. 413.)(Telegram fromGovernor,No. 226.)Trinidad. In addition to Government contributions amounting to 312,000, a first instalment amounting to  21,000 has been sent from a fundstarted by the people for the purchase of war aircraft.British Guiana.The elections which were due to be held in September 1940 have been postponed in view of the war position.Arrangements are being made for dredging the Demerara River in order tofacilitate an increase in the supply of bauxite from British Guiana which is nowurgently required.44. Ceylon.Labour Unrest. The Governor has reported that the conferences which hadbeen held between the Ceylon Minister for Labour, the planters&apos; representatives and the representatives of the labour unions have resulted in an agreement being reached between the representatives of the planters and the representatives of theunions as to the method of dealing with disputes on the estates. It remains tobe seen how far the two sides will implement this agreement in practice, but theagreement should result in some lessening of tension.Elections. It has been decided that the General Election in Ceylon shouldbe postponed for two years, and a notice of this decision has been published.   It
will now be necessary to consider what is the next step with regard to the problemof the reform of the Constitution. The State Council has passed a resolution on the subject of the Indian franchise. This resolution has not yet been received,but it is assumed that it will be a request for some additional restrictions to beplaced upon the eligibility of Indian immigrants for the franchise in Ceylon.Communist Party. Five leading members of the Ceylon Sama Samaj Party(which is commonly regarded as the local Communist party) have been detainedby the Governor under the Defence Regulations for subversive activities. Sucha step has for some time been urged by the planters&apos; associations on the groundthat much of the labour unrest in the island could be traced to Communistagitation, but the party&apos;s leaders have not hitherto given a clear opportunity for action.Gifts to His Majesty&apos;s Government. The State Council has unanimouslypassed a vote of 5,000,000 rupees ( 375,000) for the purchase of aircraft, as a first instalment of Ceylon&apos;s contribution towards the war effort. The gift hasbeen acknowledged with appreciation. A Ceylon newspaper has successfullyopened a fund for presentation to His Majesty&apos;s Government for the purchaseof military aircraft, and a wealthy Ceylonese solicitor has made a gift of  5.000.45. Malaya and Sarawak.Labour Unrest. The treatment and shipping of rubber in Singapore has (Telegrambeen held up by numerous  strikes  instigated  by  Communist  and  &quot; anti- No. 158,imperialist&quot; Chinese agitators with the object of controlling the workers and H^e&quot;1116114hampering the war effort.   The Government intervened and have powers under june 5/18,the Defence Regulations to deal with the situation.  The principal alien agitators 1940.)have been deported.Compulsory Service. Compulsory military service legislation has been enacted in the Straits Settlements and is being enacted in the Federated malay states.   It will apply to British subjects and to subjects of the Malay Rulers.Gifts to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Further gifts or loans from StateGovernments and many private individuals in Malaya have been made to HisMajesty&apos;s Government for purposes of war expenditure. These include a notablegift of  250,000 from the Sultan of Johore; $500,000 (approximately  58,000)from Sarawak, and $100,000 from Kelantan. Large sums have also been raisedby a fund organised by three Malayan newspapers and will be used for thepurchase of bombers. On the occasion of the birthday of the Raja of Perlis. theGovernment of Perlis has offered a third gift of 100,000 dollars unconditionallyto His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the cost of the war. . The offer wasgratefully accepted.46. Hong Kong.In view of the situation vis-a-vis Japan, women and children are beingevacuated.The Legislative Council has voted a further contribution of  100,000 to HisMajesty&apos;s Government for the prosecution of the war.In the absence of the Governor, Sir Geoffry Northcote, who has had to comehome on health grounds, special arrangements have been made for the adminis-tration of the government by a military officer of high rank. Lieutenant-General E. F. Norton, who has been commanding the Western District in India,has been appointed to act as Governor and Commander-in-Chief.47. Mediterranean.The complete interruption of sea-borne communications with Cyprus and malta, following upon the entry of Italy into the war, has not yet begun to have any serious economic results. Both Colonies are well supplied with essential foodstuffs. Malta has asked for additional supplies of certain commodities,including coal and medical stores.Under daily bombing raids the morale of the Maltese people is reported tobe excellent.48. Mauritius.The Mauritius Government has made a contribution of  150,000 to HisMajesty&apos;s Government for war expenses.[21543] d
/ 49. Fiji.The almost complete cessation of trade in copra is bound to result in a serious situation in Fiji, where certain sections of the community are entirely dependentupon this commodity. The position is not confined to Fiji, and is referred to in another section of this Report.50. Palestine and Transjordan.The events of the present month in Europe have deeply stirred all sectionsof the population. The speed and completeness of the German victory in france has raised Hitler&apos;s personal prestige among the Arabs, many of whom havecompared him with their own traditional heroes. Italy&apos;s entry into the war,however, has caused a compensating pro-British swing in Arab circles. Thepossibility of an Axis victory, which it is assumed would entail the seizure by italy of the Arab littoral of the Mediterranean, including Palestine and Syria,has brought realities home to most of the Arabs, and although the prospect ofthe resulting ruin to JewTs in Palestine has attractions, these are offset by theprospect of an application of the methods adopted by the Italians in Libya tothe Arabs in Palestine. In the meantime, reports of British successes againstItalians in Africa have been very well received.The main reaction to the collapse of France was speculation about the futureof Syria and the Lebanon. M. Puaux&apos;s declaration on the 23rd June wasreceived with relief by the Arabs as giving this part of the world, at any rate,a respite from the likelihood of war. But General Mittelhauser, commanding theFrench troops in Syria, who at first seemed likely to repudiate the Frencharmistice in the hopes that an alternative French Government would be set upin Algeria, has now changed his mind in response to a personal appeal byMarshal Petain. The military and civil authorities in Syria now seem to have accepted the new situation, and parties of French volunteers, who wish tocontinue fighting (including Polish units), are moving across the frontier into palestine. The Palestine Broadcasting Service instituted a service of news bulletins in French on the 23rd June, which are being given in co-operation withthe French Consulate-General.The political situation in Iraq, Egypt and Turkey is being followed withclose interest and some anxiety.The situation in Palestine itself remains quiet, although there have been some signs of the recrudescence of subversive agitation among the Arabs,particularly in the north.The first Jewish reaction to the French defeat was one of depression anddespondency.   This was partly due to propaganda that Palestine would be.attacked for political rather than military reasons, and that an Arab rising inPalestine and a Saudi attack on Transjordan were imminent.Subsequently, however, saner counsels seem to have gained a little ground.The illicit Jewish broadcasting station closed down voluntarily immediately afterItaly&apos;s entry into the war. Its closing announcement exhorted all Jews to assistthe Allies against the common enemy.In the report for May reference was made to a meeting at which the G.O.C.had made proposals to the Jewish leaders for the declaration of hidden arms.Further discussions took place, at which the G.O.C. explained very frankly the risks (both from Fifth Columnists and pure panic) inherent in a situation inwhich large numbers of secret weapons are held illegally by a section of thepublic. In spite of these explanations, the Jewish leaders refused to agree toGeneral Giffard&apos;s proposals or even to declare the number of arms in Jewishpossession. On the contrary, the Jews have continued unabated their campaign for the recognition of their right to hold such arms and for the formation of jewish units in Palestine for the defence of the National Home against eitherexternal or internal attack.Following upon representations made to His Majesty&apos;s Government by theGovernments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the Emergency Regulations were amended on the 15th June so as to provide (1) that the Military Courts should not in future have the power of imposingthe death sentence; and(2) that cases relating to offences committed prior to the 15th June shouldbe tried by the Civil and not by the Military Courts.
At the same time sentences of death which had been imposed by the military courts on six Arabs were commuted to imprisonment for life. It had become increasingly clear that recent sentences of death imposed by the Military Courtswere the cause of bitterness and misunderstanding in countries in the middle east outside Palestine. On the other hand, the internal situation in Palestineitself had so far improved as to enable the Civil Courts to function once againwith reasonable success. In all the circumstances, it was decided that the regu-lations could safely be relaxed to the extent described above, on the explicitunderstanding (made clear to the neighbouring Governments) that a deterioration in the situation in Palestine might render it necessary to restore the previous-powers to the Military Courts. This decision evoked much satisfaction amongthe Arabs. There has also been much satisfaction over the release of a largenumber of Arab detainees.The internal politics of the Jewish community are still disturbed by partyextremists overseas; but the seriousness of the international situation seems tohave impressed on the various leaders the advisability of avoiding disturbance.There has also been formed a Jewish &quot; war cabinet &quot; of all parties in theinterests of local unity.Legislation has been passed during the month to provide (a) that members of the British section of the police may be required tocontinue to serve in the Force for the duration of the war, whetheror not they have completed the period of service stipulated by their contracts; and(b) that members of the Police Force may be employed for military purposes.The situation in Trans-Jordan remains normal. The entry of Italy into thewar only served to give rise to local manifestations of support for Britain. Thechief reaction to the French defeat was intense interest and anxiety as to thefuture of Syria.Colonial Office, July 1, 1940.
