Little damage was done except at Filton, where the works were hit, causing serious damage ancasualties.
11.     On the 26th a major attack was maefcercfn&quot; -Scu^hatapton and severe damage was caused to Super-Marine Aviation and Vickerj,.Ariastrong Works.&apos;In addition bombs were dropped on-^^p^in^aii0&apos;&apos;Ji^nJ^ov]^s--asd--Whit%,Kenlow Camp, Coventry and many South .Coast--townsar:,j&apos;5ama&apos;ge-. and-casualtiesv/ere slight.12,     On the 27th there Trere/xthree^aj,er-&apos;&apos;attackrs&quot;on London and SouthEast England and a smaller attack on Filton,     The latter attack was drivenoff before it reached its objective.     In spite of the fact that it isestimated that some 850 enemy aircraft were employed little damage was doneexcept at Lambeth and Maidstone,     133 enemy aircraft were destroyed, 35probably destroyed and 52 damaged,(b) By,flight.13,     During the first week of the period the principal night, -raids      &apos;took place&quot; at Swansea and Llandarcy Oil Refineries, Bristol, Liverpool,     &quot;-.-Cardiff, and the London Dock areas. &apos; &apos;,intense -activity against London:.&apos;-&quot;&apos;-commenced on the night 7/8th September and. has been^eontinuous since,With the exception of Liverpool, which&quot;hais been attacked on several nights,the rest of the country has not been heavily, attacked,14.-    Apart from attempting&quot;to lower public morale, the main objectivesappear to have been docks, railways and public utilities, .. - The bombing ofLondon has been very widespread and much of it indiscriminate,   . The docks and the East End of London were very heavily bombed during&quot;the -first two weeks, a good, deal of damage-&quot;was&quot; done&quot;, &apos;and ,many casualties we re, caused.During the last week damage has been less, in the East End,,and greater in theSouth and South-Y/est, where considerable damage, has been done to /property,15,     Casualties,Casualties in the period totalled approximately 6,600 killed; and 10.ojseriously .injured, of whom 5,500&quot;were killed and. 8,500 injured in the london area,16,    Railways.Intensification of air,raids.has caused considerable difficultiesin railway: working particularly in the London, South &quot;Wales&apos;, Avonmouth and liverpool.areas. -   Passenger services;have been seriously delayed.Restrictions have had to be imposed at a number of points on goodstraffic, including coal, and. interchanges of traffic particularly &quot;for theGreat Western and Southern Railways-;.-fflas*.fseriously affected-, &apos; --A similiarsituation has arisen as regards the conveyance of mails &quot;by train.&apos;The position generally has, however, &apos; improved, in&quot;&apos;&apos;the last few days5&apos;17,     Docks and Harbours.Considerable damage has been&apos;clone to the London-and Liverpool Docks,warehouses., flour mills, etc,,, also to-sthe- surrounding, qomrnunications,     In-::the Port of London 27 large dock&apos;warehouses and, a&quot;B6ut 70^5 of the timberstorage accommodation in Surrey Docks have beeil destroyed.     In addition 3large flour mills, 15 important riverside wharves, 4 oil wharves, and severalriverside manufactories vrere badly damaged,.    Apart from warehousingaccommodation, however, dock facilities have been only slightly damaged.Owing to the diversion of shipping to the West Coast due to the threat of invasion, the volume-of shipping in the port when heavy attacks began onSeptember 7th was less than normal, but 16 ships have been seriously damaged,of which 2 large and 3 small ships can probably be reckoned total losses.On the night of September 26th, 2 grain warehouses were destroyed and a numberof transmit sheds gutte&quot;. at Liverpool but there was no damage to ships.
18.     The effect of the&apos; closure of London and-of the &apos; damage, to other,ports has inevitahly thrown a heavy burden on the ports generally (other thanLondon) particularly in view of arrivals of large quantities of steel andscrap.     In spite of internal transport difficulties-owing to bombing no&apos; &apos;serious.-,or,persistent congestion..has. yet arisen,/   Considerable quantities ofgoods have,/been distributed by coastwise shipping and the emergencyarrangemerit-s-jto,. discharge overside into coasters at the Tail of the Bank&apos; onthe Clyde have,,been. brought into operation.     Dock labour has been freelytransferred to those ports at which there, was heavy pressure,-10 o;-, Roads^Damage to road communications has been mainly in the London&apos; area^where very considerable obstruction of roads.has added to transport difficulties- and where.restoration has been hampered by the need of prior;demolition-of.:dangerous buildings and the repair of underground mains... andservicese     Elsewhere bomb craters have been promptly fill in, and there has.been no serious dislocation of traffic,     Unexploded bombs have causedtemporary local diversions-in some areas,,.:   Some damage to vehicleshas resulted from enemy&apos;&quot;action&quot;, but&apos; this has&quot;not been -serious$20*     Sir Warren Fisher has.been appointed, as a special. Commissioner, inthe London.&apos;Civil,Defence Region to co-ordinate and&apos; facilitate the work of theauthorities, responsible for the,restoration of roads and&apos;-public utilityservices; damaged by enemy action,- and ,to organise the clearance and salvageof debris0In general, despite&apos;damage&apos; to. power&apos; stations in they London area, theGrid system was able to. maintain-supplies,-.but local interruptions&apos; have occurred in many parts&apos; of the country-,;,due to damage to &apos;overhead dines andunderground mains.     The damage Has been most serious in London, Vyhere theFulham, East Ham, Battersea and -,Finsbury&apos; Power -Stations have beeh&quot;;hit.     Therehas also been widespread&apos;interference&apos; by drifting barrage balloons with gridlines and&apos;other overhead lines,.-particularly in.N.W. and S.E.. England,-resulting.&apos;in: many losses of. supply,&apos; although generally not for - long,22 o     Telecommunications,Considerable delay has been inflicted upon the-telegraph service as a result of serious, damage to.,the Central Telegraph Office on the. .12th September,&apos; with a resultant loss of output amounting, to over QOfo,Service was gradually restored,and was practically complete within., a fortnight.&quot;Happily the damage to the telephone service, which was mainly confined to London is not so serious,.Three main London exchanges were seriously damaged or destroyed and several others suffered damage, but service to essential subscribers was maintained and that- to private subscribers&apos; is being, restored,.    Serious damage to junction arid main cables-in the London: Central area has. slowed down long distance   traffic and severely affected telephone communications for london as a wholeoSome damage to communications has also been sustained at Bradford,Swansea;, Bristol, Liverpool and Birkenhead.23,   Posjts.As may be expected,.the postal services have suffered severely fromthe dislocation of railway services, and the concomitant suspension of travelling Post Office,,     In addition night raiding has prevented effective &apos;&quot;work by night at the main London Sorting Offices an essential feature of the postal Services;,
. ,&apos;. Two hundred and twenty-five Postal buildings -in London have been damaged or temporarily put out of action by enemy air activity during september, US.,24,     Gas, .;:.\.-&apos; .  .  :     .-Serious hardship to individuals, and loss of production have been caused in many parts of London as a., result of-restricted or suspended servicecaused by-damage&quot;to; Gas Works, principally-..those at Beekton, Battersea,Stepney, and.Lambeth.     The position which is complicated by the leakage ofwater into the pipes, has however, improved recently, particularly since the partial - restoration&apos;Of service from Beckton......   25.-     Yfeter supply and sewerage-,,- -  Outside London there has been practically no damage of importance,though there have been temporary local interruptions&apos;of water supply, e.g, at&quot;Gloucester and &quot;Portland, In the London Region the northern outfall sewer(which deals with about 180 million gallons a day) was badly broken but isnow functioning again,, Repairs have taken between 3 and 4 weeks - a verycreditable achievement by the London County Council,. When, intensive bombing of London began there was at first surprisingly little damage to importantwater mains but latterly there has been a good deal and it. has been necessary&quot;.to import additional labour so&apos;that&apos;repairs may. catch up on.damage..     Ithas frequently been possible to restore supplies Very quickly in whole or inpart by-use of&apos; alternative routes, but ih some districts In the East and-South of-London- it has been necessary to erect standpipes and in various districts -pressure is-.J.ow.&apos;.&apos; ,. &quot;-26.,-. . Public buildings, factories and other buildings..A great deal cf damage has been done, to :both private property andpublic buildings in London,     The latter include Buckingham. Palace,Hampton Court Palace? - the Houses of Parliament^.&apos; -London County.Hall, theCentral Telegraph&quot; Office, . -the Imperial War Museum,. the National and TateGalleries, i the Inner Temple- and Library, and the Royal Courts of Justicet.27.     The aircraft industry has also suffered, notably:-Rollason and Redwing Factories, Croydon*Shortts Aircraft Factory, Cuxton.    f-  Vickers Armstrong, -Weybrldge and Southampton,       &apos;Bristol:Aeroplane Company, Filton,,     &apos;- Superrnarlne Aviation Works, Southampton. &apos; &apos;&quot;--&apos;-Cunliffe   Owen Aircraft Works, Southampton.-A&apos;great   many other factories of various industries have been hit but whilst the damage has .been considerable, production as.a whole has been only slightly affected -thereby,      &apos;..&apos;..-28,     During the month the damage to house property has been extensive.Separate figures for the month are not available, but for the week ending21st September, 1940,  it is estimated that 43,800 houses: were damaged, ofwhich 39,000 were, repairable,, while in the following week 54,300 houses&apos;were- damaged, of which 51,OOOv/ere repairable e   &quot;Roughly: two-thirds of the damage occurred in the London Civil: Defence Region,     These&apos; figures compare with the roughly,estimated total of 93,000 houses damaged from the beginningof-the war until 14th September, 1940, of which 87,000 were repairable.29.     Fires.One of the outstanding features of the attack on London in-thisperiod has been the number of fires caused by incendiary and high&quot;&quot;explosive bombs.&quot;    Apart from innuraberable small fires dealt with by hand appliances,there have been, every  -ight save one since 7th September, more than 200 fir0
requiring the attention of &quot;the brigade,     On three separate nights theservices were called upon to&apos; deal with more than 1,000 fires and the average number during the whole period of just over three weeks was over 600.30.     Operations were heaviest on the night of September 7th-8th, whenthe London Region had 1,100 fires, including 60 serious fires and 7conflagrations, one of which, at Silvertown, required 600 appliances.Since then, fire damage has been less serious, but on many nights there havebeen up to 4 conflagrations and 40 serious fires, the worst occurring inthe Dock areas.     There have been two bad fires In the Woolwich Arsenaland six in the City of London.31,   The pre-arranged scheme for mutual reinforcement of brigades withinthe Region has been put intor-ioperation on many occasions and has. worked well,,0n the 7th/8th September the whole resources of the Region were severelytaxed and reserves from other Regions were brought up to strategic pointsround the capital but, in the event, little demand was made upon them.    since then there&apos; has been no occasion to call on brigades outside the Region.There have unfortunately been a good many casualties, including 50fatal and about 500 other injuries in the London Fire Service alone.32,     Beyond the London Region boundary, at Purfleet, Thames Havenand Shell Haven, oil tanks and industrial premises have been repeatedlyattacked.     One fire was burning for 10 days.     Regional reinforcementmeasures were also, brought into operation for certain of these fires.33.     Unexploded Bombs.Unexploded bombs and parachute   mines present a very serious problem and much of the dislocation of communications and traffic has been due tothem.     Every effort is being made by the military authorities to strengthen the bomb disposal parties and to provide bomb &quot;cemeteries&quot; in convenientplaces in London where they can be dealt with.     An unexploded bomb weighlya ton was removed from near St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral.     If this had exploded itwould not only have affected the Cathedral itself but would have destroyed allthe Trunk telephone lines to the north,34. .   Work of the Civil Defence Services.The work of these services has been magnificent during a very tryingperiod.     Co-operation between services has worked extraordinarily well.Casualties among personnel have fortunately not been severe, having regard tothe numbers engaged,35,     Interruptions in telephone communications, have added to.thedifficulties of the Services.     There is still a slight tendency to exaggeratethe extent of damage and casualties, causing an excess of services to be despatched to an incident.36,     Air Raid Warning System.In conformity with the policy of minimising interference to production due to air raids or air raid warnings, a leaflet entitled &quot;Workingafter the Siren&quot; has been widely distributed to workers and employers through their associations and trade unions and through the Regional InformationCommittees,     The leaflet recommends the continuance of work during a warninguntil it is clear that attack is imminent.     For this purpose, the establishmentof a roof watcher system and the provision of emergency protection in factories are recommended.37,     Organisations representing the operators of public service vehicles and their employees have also been asked to conform with this policy and tocontinue to carry passengers until there are definite indications that an actual attack is likely to take place in the vicinity.
m38,     In the light of experience;, some of the larger warning districtshave heen sub-divided so as to provide a means of warning certain targetareas without.spreading the warning to large non-industrial areas not solikely to be attacked.     Boundaries have also been modified iij. some caseswith a view to the smoother working of the civil defence services.In view of the-heavy incendiary attacks in many, parts of thecountry an Order has &quot;been  made under the Defence Regulations requiring the occupiers of premises at which more than 30 persons work, and of alllarge warehouses and timber-yards., to maintain fire watchers on the premise-sicontinuously, &apos; jl40.     Generally, : the fire services have proved adequate to requirement;as -regards.both appliances and- men,but the personnel were severely taxed at mtimes-in certain districts In the JLondon Region-.     Arrangements are being    Mmade to strengthen the establishments in certain districts as volunteersbecome available, and the whole .question of -the maintenance of fire servitstrengths is receiving &quot;special attention, in consultation with the Ministry Jof Labour and National Service 041,     Air Raid Shelters,, \.The course of - &quot;enemy raids on London during the past month hasnecessitated certain changes in shelter policy,..     Night raiding has become   Iregular and the civil population in the Metropolitan area have adopted asa matter of routine&apos;the practice of going at dusk, irrespective of warnings,!to shelters, there to remain until dawn.42, Steps have been taken to increase -the. total, available capacity of Ishelters of all kinds, both by pressing on with programmes of construction Iand by making fuller use of existing shelters,, For this latter purpose, ,new Defence Regulation has been made empowering local authorities in suitablaicases to utilise shelters in factories and commercial buildings and basements!of private houses as shelters for the public0B43.     A committee has been-appointed under the Chairmanship of LordHorder to enquire into the, conditions of shelters, with, particular refereni&quot;to health.     In accordance with the Committee,?s&quot; recommendations, addition?amenities are being,provided, in. public, shelters in London,     In addition to Iburies, large numbers of which dare being ordered, local authorities have been 1asked to press on with the provision, of lighting (where this does not exist).!drinking water, sanitary arrangements, .and first aid equipment0     In largeshelters, ,authority has been given for :t&apos;he&apos; appointment of,full-time shelter Imarshals.     Efforts are also being made to popularise domestic and communal Ishelters, of which full use is in many areas not being made,,     The cost of  -materials used by local authorities in the construction and equipment ofshelters is now reimbursed in full by the Exchequer,,44,     Evacuation.During the period under review various further measures of evacuation have been carried out; -&quot; ;-(i)   Special^MScheme for 13aat ^ and. South.East Coast Towns.On military advice it was decided that, evacuation of the children,mothers, aged and infirm and others not engaged in employment should be encouraged forthwith-from a.&apos;number of towns additional  !to, those previously included in the East Coast Scheme, viz:-        1Ipswich, Colchester, Ashford, Canterbury, New Romney, Lydd, Rye?Hastings, Bexhill, Eastbourne, Seaford and Newhaven,,    Special. trains were arranged to selected reception areas in the countries of Berkshire, Oxfordshire,, Gloucester, Somerset, Wiltshire,Leicestershire and Northamptonshire ^ for those who were unable tomake their own arrangements0   Evacuation began on Wednesday,
September .11, and was substantially completed in two or three days,,:.  Approximately 48,000 persons were evacuated by the specialtrains but over. 60,000 persons have left by other means.Measures . in., the - London Area&apos;^(a). School-Children,,     The Sonbiihg attacks on London led tosome increase in the T/xliingne-ss of parents to register their children of school a&apos;ge for*&quot;.evacuationc     During the monthapproximately . 30, 000 schoolchildren were evacuated but even under the conditions of aerial attack the return of children from: the reception, areas&quot;. tbjLondon has; not ceased;   about ,000 :childreh. returned /-during/ the: fortnight ended september 21st 0-(b) -Mothers, and Ohildrehy  &apos;--lia-vlew of the conditions arising in London as a result of:air&quot;attack, it was decided to offerfacilities for the evacuation of. mothers with their children.These facilities -were first &quot;offered to those who had been rendered home less&quot; by air attaclc.&apos; in the area of the LondonCounty Council and the County Boroughs of East Ham and We st,Ham, -    The facilities were &quot;subsequently extended to allmothers and children in the Coylity, Boroughs. of East Ham and west Ham and the- - Metropolitan&apos;, boroughs of Bermondsey,Bethnal G-reen, Deptf ord3 vpopiar,,. Shoreditch and Stepney, the districts in which -conditions were.regarded as most difficult,.Registration under this extended&quot;plan began on September 25thand evacuation on September 23th.p     About 10,000 mothers andchildren were;:i.ev;acuated -durirgf;-;the-&quot; last 3 days of the month.For children under five without.mothers, or where the homecircumstances&apos; are: such that it&apos;.is.quite impossible for the mother to: accompany them, or take them to shelter in raids,ten&apos; country residential nurseries additional to the 100already in operation are being opened by the Waif s andStrays Society with the assistance of the American Red Cross.(c) expectation.tant Mo the rs. -1 In consequence of the air raids the numberof expectant mothers evacuated from London has greatlyincreased..     Approximately 600 mothers in the last month ofpregnancy are evacuated? each week from&apos; the London Area,Arrangements have been&quot;-made to assist - London maternityhospitals, v/hich have. been bombed,: by establishing maternityunits in the reception areasp     These units will be run by. the hospital authorities under the supervision of the:we If are ^authority; &quot;in the reception area(d) Aged and infirm persons..    Aged and infirm persons who are- unable to &quot;look after,-themselves are being collected, fromRest Centres-in. all.parts of London, taken to hospitalstemporarily and then transferred to homes on the outskirts ofLondon,     Aged and infirm persons who have been more or lesspermanently resideixt;.in &quot;shelters are being&apos; registered with,a view to .their being&quot;.ic:o.llected and transferred to institutions and hospitals in the provinces - this registration duringthe month covered only the Boroughs of Poplar, West Ham,East Ham, Stepney, Bethnal Green, Shoreditch, Bermondseyand Deptford.Extension of Birminpiham Area for Evacuation of Children,,During the month representations were received from Birmingham forthe inclusion in the evacuable area of an additional portion of theCity which experience had shown was the special object of air attack.Approval was given to this proposal:    facilities for registration of school children were given and about 1,400 children (38^ of the total in the area) were registered and evacuated.
45,     Emergency Hospital Scheme.The number of beds available for casualties in England and wales was on the 25th September about 142,500, being 5,600 less than wereavailable a month ago.     Of these, 112,000 were ready for immediateoccupation and 30,500 were in reserve.     The number of beds available forcasualties in Scotland was 22,363, as compared with 19,819 a month ago,46,     The number of Service casualties notified on 25th September asbeing E.M.S. hospitals in England and Wales was about 6,000, as comparedwith 7,000 at the end of August,     There -were also about 18,800 servicesick- in E,M, S, hospitals in England and Wales, this figure having risen by 1,800 during the month.     There were 304 Service casualties and 2,667Service sick in E.M, S, hospitals in Scotland.47,     The number of civilian casualties notified on the 25th Septemberas being inE.M,S. hospitals in England and Wales was 5,036 (this figure includes a small number of Civil Defence Workers injured in the course oftheir duty otherwise than by enemy action).     The number of casualties in E.M. S, hospitals in Scotland&apos; Y/as 161, including Civil Defence workers and Mercantile Marine,48,     Twenty-three hospdtals in the inner London area have been moreor less seriously damaged during the month&apos;s air raiding five having beenput completely out of action and several more reduced to a small number ofcasualty beds.     No difficulty has been experienced in transferring patients and staff from the damaged hospitals to outer hospitals and the accommodation available in London Region is still more than adequate, being 34,000 bedsimmediately available and 6,400 in reserve.     Comparatively few casualties have been caused when hospitals have been damaged, as patients and staff havebeen in shelter in basements or in strengthened parts of the buildings,49,     Provision for the Homeless.The intensive raiding on London v/hich began on the 7th Septemberthrevir a heavy burden on the organisation set up by the Public assistance and billeting authorities for dealing with homeless people.     The situation has been complicated by the use of delayed action bombs, which have caused the emergency rest centres to become crowded with temporarily homelesspeople who are unwilling to leave their own neighbourhood, at least until they have learned the fate of their homes.50.     It was found that the existing arrangements, which contemplateda stay in the rest centres of at most two days, were inadequate to meet this situation and instructions were issued that the standard of comfort at the centres should be raised.     For example, though the provincial authoritiesprovided a hot meal ea.ch day for those in the centres, the L.C.C. did not do this.     They were Instructed to do so, and generally local authorities were given a free hand to spend money on improving equipment and amenities.51.     Staffing has also been found inadequate, and the local authoritieshave been instructed to strengthen the staff at the rest centres and, inthe London Region, to arrange for the attendance day and night of a trainednurse at each,52,     A memorandum of information for homeless people has been prepared in the Department and circulated to locr.1 authorities for use at rest centres.
53,     In Lodnon there has &quot;been some lack of co-ordination between theCounty Council and the Metropolitan Borough Councils as billeting authorities,and administrative action, including the appointment to the staff of theDepartment of 10 temporary welfare officers with special experience of social work, has been directed, with a great measure of success, to securing asmooth flow of people through the rest centres,,     Billeting authorities throughout the country had already been instructed, where necessary, to requisition unoccupied houses for the accommodation of homeless people, and14 of the more favourably situated London Boroughs were instructed duringthe period under review immediately to requisition and equip housessufficient to accommodate an aggregate of 20^000 people,54c     On the 27th September,. Mr.,. Henry Willink, K.C., M.P., was appointed as a Deputy Regional Commissioner for the London Region with the specificfunction of supervising the arrangements for the care and rehousing of people rendered homeless as a result of air raids055,    Accommodation for Government staffsADespite a considerable amount of damage to Government buildingsre-housing of staffs has not been required yet to any great extent, but onlya very small reserve of accommodation is in hand in London for such re-housing.During the period under review some 1, 500 civil servants have been moved outof London,,56,     Pblice^ rejports^ en Public Order and Morale.Morale continues to be good.,,     Unofficial evacuees, chiefly from london, have been arriving in many parts of the country, including the Eastand South coasts, and in some the problem of their accommodation is presentingserious difficultiese     The charges for private accommodation have in somecases been greatly increased and there are complaints of extortion,     A numberof Chief Constables oommont on the high proportion of aliens amongst theevacuees.-,57o     There continues to be much criticism of the warning system in areas where there has been bombing before or after the warning period and whereenemy planes are heard though no warning is sounded,     There are a fewcomplaints that the sirens do not sound for long enough under the new arrangements,,     Some apprehension has been expressed in some areas because ofwhat is regarded as inadequacy of the fighter and other defences,58,   Earlier closing of places of entertainment under voluntary or compulsory arrangements is now fairly general, and evening attendances are small.59,     Communist propaganda is new chiefly concerned with the need for deepshelters but generally speaking it seems still to be on a small scale.60,     Awards for Gallantry^^As a means of affording recognition to the many acts of gallantry by civil defence volunteers and other civilians arising out of enemy action, two new awards have been instituted with the King!s approval.     The George Crossis intended to reward the performance of deeds of valour by civilians in allwalks of life and will rank with and immediately after the Victoria Cross,The George Medal will rank, with medals awarded for gallantry and distinguishedconduct.     Awards have already been made of the George Cross and the Medal,H.M.MINISTRY OP HOME SECURITY,WHITEHALL,5th October, 1940u
