CIVIL DEFENCE REPORT HP. 20.Twentieth Report submitted by the Ministerof Home Security, covering the period from midnight, 7th July, 1940, to Midnight 4th August, 1940.(Previous Report:   Paper No. W.P. (H)(4) 178).Enemy Air Attack.1.      During the period under review some bombs have been dropped everynight except two and every day except five, but except for two raids on Norwichthere has been practically no daylight bombing since the 26th July.   Prior to   !that date, there were   olaylight raids on a number of towns, mainly on or neap-the coast, including Aberdeen, Fraserburgh, Leith, Glasgow, BriClington, Norwich,Brighton, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Falmouth, Cardiff and Swansea.     The heaviestcivilian losses were incurred at Aberdeen (32 killed and 76 injured) andPortsmouth (18 killed.and 55 injured). -2.      Many of the night raids have been connected with mine-laying activities in the estuaries of the Thames, Humber, Tyne and Tees, in the Firths 0** Forth,Tay and Clyde and in the Bristol Channel.   A few mines have been dropped on land.Casualties.3*     The total civilian casualties during the period were 206 killed, 252seriously injured, and 616 slightly injured.Daylight raids accounted for three-quarters of the fatal casualties and half the total injured.   At Banff on the 22nd. July bombs fell on the prisoners of war camp, killing 6 and wounding 16 German prisoners, and killing1 and wounding 21 of the guards?   A few casualties have been caused by machine gun fire.Damage.4.      Damage caused has been slight compared with the number of bombs dropped.   This is especially the case as regards night bombing.   Boulton &amp; Paul.bworks at Norwich suffered damage in daylight raids on two occasions, and therehas been some damage to shipping at Falmouth Docks, to a power station and railway lines at Swansea, to a gas works at Portsmouth, and to a factory at-Aberdeen.Pires*5, .,   The most serious fires occurred at Falmouth Harbour on July 10th, whenfive ships and a wharf were set on fire by H.E. bombs and the regionalreinforcement scheme successfully operated;   at Bridlington on July 11th, whenH.E. bombs fell in a goods yard, setting fire to kerosene tanks and a van loaded with shells, some of which exploded, the fire being brought under control after about three-quarters of an hour of difficult and dangerous fire fighting?   at portsmouth on the same date when a gasometer was fired by an H.S. bombj   atDover Harbour on July 29th, when during a raid by 30 - 40 bombers, two naval vessels were struck and set on fire, one of them being saved by the-fire services %and at Norwich on August 1st when an aircraft factory (Boulton &amp; Paul&apos;s) was hit by H.E. bombs and a joiner*s shop, a canteen and offices were burnt out.6. Numerous, fires caused by incendiary bombs have also been successfullydealt with by stirrup  hand pumps, there being one case on record in whichstirrup hand pumps effectively controller, three bombs which fell in a singleroom.     It has been decided to increase the number of these pumps which are tobe carried by pump units, arid it has been suggested to fire authorities that anumber of these appliances with essential equipment should be kept ready forimmediate despatch by car to the scene of an incendiary bomb attack.
......   7.       Jji&apos;&quot;order to reduce the risk of fire an Order has been made under   &apos;the Defence Regulations requiring all articles to be removed from loftS in-houses and other residential buildings,. f-y.Air Raid Warning System-8*       In order to minimise interference with production in vital war industries caused by frequent public warnings;? th&quot;e;,:system of warningmessages has been modified, by the introduction of a newy!jpurple&quot; or &quot;Lights&quot;warning.; which -will normally follow the, preliminar&apos;ary&quot;^yexipw11 warnings   Thepurpose of the new message-/is to-provide-&apos; a&apos; signal on which exempted lightingwill be extihguIsheS&apos;-without&apos;--giving a public air - raid, warning.-Pr ot e ct ive Me asur&amp;W-&apos;- &apos; - - ....9o       Steel helmets known as G-rade 2 are being supplied for certainclasses of user, including the exposed workers ii industry who are &quot;exapected.&quot;to continue at work, after an air raid warning..   This helmet is. made of a lowerquality of. steel than Grs.de .1 (all supplies of which are wanted for theFighting Forces) but affords adequate protection against debris and splintersoiQo      Forty-five million pairs of moulded rubber&apos;&apos; ear-plugs haw&apos; been ordered for^the whole population^   The order will.take 5 or 4 months tocomplete*llo       In-view of the increased likelihood of gas-being used in an. attackon this country? local-authorities have been asked to take suitable steps,eago through the Wardensorganisation- and by means of lectures., to keep&apos; thedanger of gas in the minds of the public.Conditions of Service, ef,.Civil pefence Volunteerso   . ...12o       Following on the measures already taken to-conserve the &quot;personnel of the police and fire services, steps have beenr-taken to- reserve whole-time members of Rescue and First Aid Party Services at, the-age of 30 and to preventwithdrawals from these services except for service in the -Armed Forces or-other work of national&apos; importance? .13.     Local authorities have been asked to take suitable steps to mixlmi.sethe risk of undue strain on part-tine A.R0P0 personnel caused by frequentcalling out on an air-raid warnings,.   The general principles which they navebeen asked to.follow ares reduction to a minimum of the calling out of * -part-time volunteers In..advance of the &quot;Action&quot; warning, aitd the organisationof a rota system among..the ava.ila.ble personnel so that a proportion are notrequired to report for;,duty until bombing has actually occurred or untilspecially summonedo &apos;&apos;     ;Evacuation.14.       By virtue of declarations made under the Defence (Evacuation&quot; Areas)Regulations, persons who have left the East Anglian and Kent coast tow as forwhich plans, for compulsory evacuation have been prepared have been granted,relief.in respect&apos;of rent, rates and certain other local charges* The reliefdoes., not,take the form of a.&apos;remission of the charges? but merely postponement.of liability to pays -    &apos;-&apos;&quot;.&apos;15.       About 7,500 children from the East Sussex coast towns which wererecently declared evacuation areas, and about 8,300 children from the london area, who had been evacuated-to the Sussex.-coast, were removed inland duringthe period. - - - -16*       There is evidence of an appreciable drift back to the evacuationareas.   Figures obtained from the London. County Council shew that during thefortnight ended the 27th July,&apos; 7,500 children.&apos;-returned to the London area,of whom 3,500 were children who had formed part of the recent evacuatiolt Ofregistered children which&apos;took place on June -13th - June IStho   The Ministerof Health has appealed to parents individually not to.bring their children:back, and publicity has been given, to. /this, appeal and. to the reasons for keeping the children in the&apos;&apos;reception areas*&apos;
Emergency Hospital Scheme.       -17.     The number of beds available for casualties has increased by,000 in England and Wales,, and.by .1,775 in Scotland during the period.Arrangements have also been, made&apos;&quot; with the War Organisation of -the BritishRed.. Gross.,Society and Order-of St. John for the establishment ofconvalescent homes for military patients, and auxiliary hospitals whichwill be available to swell the general pool of accommodation for&apos;casualties.-    By these and other means, including the taking over ofprivate houses near hospitals, it is hoped&apos; to provide an additional20,000.beds in England and Wales alone-.     Steps are also being taken, toearmark boarding and other schools;&apos;as hospitals to be taken over in theevent of casualties proving to be so heavy that they cannot be dealt within the existing hospitals.18.     Arrangements have been nade for improving the co-operationbetween the civil and military casualty services.     A R.A.M.C. liaison officer has been appointed to each Civil Defence Region (excludingLondon and- Scotland, where this is not necessary) to work with theMinistry &apos;of Health&apos;s-Hospital Officer.  .  Arrangements have also &quot;beenmade for the pooling: of medical and nursing staff and of supplies. - ...19.      In view of the difficulty of filling junior resident posts incasualty and other hospitals,  arrangements have been made for the use,where necessary, of the Minister of Labour&apos;s powers, under- the defence regulations-, to order practitioners of either sex to take up vacantposts in hospitals or other public medical work.     It is unlikely thatthese powers will have to be used except very occasionally,..Orders under the Defence Regulations. ......20, .   Following on the Motor Vehicles (Control) Order referred to&apos;inthe last report51&apos;, an Order has been made under the Defence Regulationsrequiring owners of vessels on inland waterways to take appropriatesteps to immobilise their vessels when left unattended.      This Order was generally on the lines of the earlier Admiralty Vessels (immobilisation)Order which applies to coastal and tidal waters.Curfew areas have been declared by Regional Commissioners along the yorkshire, East Anglian, Kent and Sussex coasts and access to beaches hasbeen prohibited in many areas.     In the Eastern and South Eastern Regions,boarding schools were ordered to break up for the Summer holidays, in mid-July, and powers were vested in Regional Commissioners to close largeprivate day schools not possessing a certain standard of protection.Several Regional Commissioners also issued directions under Regulations16A and 70 for the control of traffic on roads in these Areas.Railways.21.     Air raids and warnings continue to cause delay to rail traffic in many areas,  but there has been no serious dislocation.     Somecongestion at yards and depots is resulting from exceptionally heavy coal and military traffic at a season when freight is unusually heavy.     Coalwaggons under load have continued to accumulate especially in SouthWales where about 27,000 await transhipment.     To ease the situation ithas been necessary from time to time to impose temporary restrictions onthe acceptance and forwarding of general traffic for various stations.Docks and Harbours.22.     Damage by enemy action in ports has been negligible.     Althoughconditions remain generally satisfactory,  air raids and warnings have caused delay in discharge and clearance at certain ports - mainlyBristol Channel - but these dalays were not as great as those d.ue to*   Civil Defence Report No. 19, paragraph 19.
torrential rains in the early part of the month.     The intermittent :closing of ports owing to mine-laying has also had Its effect, but exceptin the case of Port Talbot (closed since 26th July) the closure periodshave been short.-   23.     To meet the situation produced by limitations on the size and speed of vessels, sent to the East Coast, which particularly affectships equipped with refrigerator plant, certain pre-arranged plans have.been brought into partial operation to secure supplies to london by rail. .   London contains 50. per cent, of the refrigerated storage in.the country and, at the moment, 80 per cent, of the available emptyrefrigerated space.Roads.24.     In a few cases roads- have had to-be temporarily closed and,traffic diverted because of bomb craters.    &quot;Nowhere has there been&apos;serious damage, and delay to road traffic has been mainly due to thetime taken in restoring water, gas and electricity services.Electricity..25.     The Electricity Commissioners received reports from 28different electricity undertakers of failures from damage by bombs,In most instances due to bomb splinters severing overhead lineconductors or damaging line supports or insulators.     In the majorityof cases the supply was restored in a. few hours. ,No cases were reported of serious or prolonged failures, or of definitedamage to plant in any of the public supply generating stations.J.A.MINISTRY OP HOME SECURITY,HOME.
