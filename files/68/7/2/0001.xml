MINISTRY   OF   FOODREPORT FOR JUNE, 1940SUPPLY, CONSUMPTION, STOCKS, PRICES AND RATIONING-introduction the approach of the end of the first year of war makes it possible to obtaincloser estimates of the. imports of foods and animal feeds during that period.Allowing for the considerable losses at sea in recent weeks and including divertedcargoes (conservatively estimated at 626,000 tons), total imports of foods andanimal feeds during the first year of war are estimated at 21,058 thousand tons,1,039 thousand tons more than the Ministry&apos;s programme, and only 1,885 thousand tons less than the average for the five years preceding the war.    The principalvariations from this programme are:Increases Decreases.......    &apos;000 tons       .......Wheat and flour 821Maize - 69Cereal offals - 102Oilcake 66Oilseeds 64Canned meat 31Starches and glucose 62Dairy produce - 54The import programme for the second year of war is in an advanced state of preparation.     The total tonnage for which programmes are being prepared is18,324 thousand, of which 15 millions represent a minimum blockade programme.This minimum should provide a diet only sufficient to cover nutritional necessitieswithout reducing bulk stocks.    Should conditions impose such a drastic cut,(6 million tons or about 30%) in imports, severe rationing of animal feeds andabnormal slaughter of livestock will be necessary.     The difference (3.3 million tons) between the minimum and the total second year of war programme is regarded asa conservative supplementary programme, the fulfilment of which would assistmaterially in the maintenance of the present output of livestock products and in theaddition to the human diet of foods which would provide a more varied and anutritionally sounder fare.     The supplementary programme will be arranged on apriority basis in order to ensure the importation of those commodities most urgently required.1.    GENERAL NOTE ON SUPPLY POSITION.Tables and diagrams indicating the supply position&apos;of the principal foodsand animal feeds are included in the appendix;&quot;Further expansions of stocks of a number of important commodities   tookplace in June;   these included wheat, maize, oilcake and sugar.     The seasonalreduction in the consumption by animals of concentrated feeds has made it possibleto begin the creation of useful reserves for.winter feeding, and it is hoped thatthis policy and the harvesting of the new home crop will, by the end of September,result in appreciably greater stocks of animal feeding-stuffs than at the outbreakof war.s   In the forecasts, there given for July, August and September no allowance hasbeen made for possible losses at sea.    As shipping tonnage has not yet beenarranged for a large part of September, the predictions for that month mustbe regarded as less reliable than those for July and August.
Stocks of bacon and butter continued their decline, but no serious difficulty is expected in the provision of supplies to meet rationed demands.Stocks of tea showed a further fall, but the introduction of rationing shouldmake reconstruction possible.     The rationing of margarine and cooking fats will assist materially in the creation of a reserve which, following the removalof the restriction on the use of preservatives in these fats, is now possible.The foods shown in Table II of the appendix, together with condensed milk and jam, normally supply about four-fifths of the calories provided by the humandiet.     At the end of June total stocks of these commodities, excluding thoseheld by retailers and the potential output of livestock products, were capable ofproviding a balanced diet of these foods for a period of 12.2 weeks.     Stocks offood held by retailers are capable of providing a further fortnight&apos;s supply.In addition, the stocks of animal feeding-stuffs were sufficient to maintain thepresent rate of output, of milk, meat, bacon and eggs for a period of 7 weeks;thereafter the rate, of output would decline appreciably, but not catastrophically.A severe shortage of eggs occurred in June,     This shortage is likelyto continue and even become more acute pending the arrival in the late autumn ofimports from the southern hemisphere.     It is hoped, however, that importedand stored supplies together with home-produced eggs will enable the bulk of thedemand to be met during the winter months.2,    WHEAT, FLOUR AND BREADTotal U.K. stocks on 29th JuneEstimated weekly total consumption (July)Estimated weekly consumption as flour (July)(in terms of wheat)2,410,000 tons126,000     11122,000     &quot;The reserve stocks of wheat and flour at the end of June were equivalentto 16.5 weeks1 supply at the June rate of consumption as flour, compared with13.8 weeks&apos; supply (at the May rate of consumption) at the end of May.     The newhome crop is forecasted at about 1,750,000 tons as compared with 1,670,000 tons,the 1934/38 average.      If it is safely harvested and if it were all consumed asflour, it would meet requirements for an additional 14 weeks.    Imports of wheat and flour are expected to be. slightly above the import programme in July and considerably in excess in August.Stocks of flour at the end of June, including reserve and working stocks,amounted to 7.7 weeks&apos; requirements, and were dispersed as-follows:-Public warehouses (mainlyat ports)Mills (Port and Country)Bakers, wholesalers and retailers (estd.)Thousand tons210315170No. of weeks 1supply2,33.51.9per cent of total304525Total695100Millers within 10 miles of the south and east coasts have now been instructed to limit the stocks of flour in their mills to 1-g- weeks&apos; supply and to transferexisting reserve stocks to inland areas as soon as practicable.Action is now being taken to give effect to the instructions of theFood Policy Committee (a) to secure the admixture of synthetic Vitamin Bl and ofcalcium salts in all bread made of White flour of 73^ extraction, and the additionof a small amount of calcium in all bread made of flour of 80fo extraction;(b) to make available at a suitable price sufficient supplies of brown bread madeof flour of 80/o extraction; and (c) to make known to the public the advantages of (a) and (b).2e
&apos;9 ..   i?Bakers have been pressing the Ministry for some time to allow an increasein the price of bread, but they agreed at the end of lay to maintain current prices pending enquiry into the possibilities of reducing production and distributioncosts.     The widespread and costly practice of exchanging old bread for new has&quot;been prohibited, and it is intended that only four types of household loaf shall be permitted. T/&apos;.Tn addition, it is proposed to liitiit&apos; deliveries of bread, as far aspossible to three days a week, and the slicing&apos;and wrapping of bread may, in orderto save paper and expense, be prohibited.    It is estimated that the limitation of the;types of loaf arid the restriction of retail deliveries will reduce costs by atleast -gd. on the&apos;quartern loaf, and thus avoid an immediate increase in the price of bread.Baking capacity in the country-is. greatly. in..jSxc.ess.;of &apos;:p.ea;es.t: ii&quot;ae..requirements,but in case, of emergency some areas may have temporary difficulties in maintainingsupplies from their own resources,- and in this event they will be supplied withbread from adjoining Pood Divisions, whilst, locally, bakers will assist one anotherif bakeries are put out of action by air attack,For yeast supplies we are now entirely dependent upon home production whichis concentrated in six factories of which two, at Bristol and Liverpool, are of outstanding importance.     Pull supplies could be maintained even if one of these were put out of action.     Arrangements have been made to ensure distribution tobakeries in the event of serious dislocation of long distance transport, and bakersare to be informed how fermentation could be carried on if they were unable toobtain distillers&apos; yeast,3,    ANIMAL PEEDlNG-STUFFS.-,Maize-    &apos;  Barley    &apos; Oilcakes- - &apos; --   &apos;       v &apos; . . &apos;000 tons &apos; vTotal IT.K, stocks&apos; on&apos; 29th June      &apos; &apos; -&apos; &apos;199&apos;; 220 175&apos;Estimated total weekly consumption (July) 34 25 14 - -&apos;\&apos;Imports of cereal feeds have been augmented in recent months by the diversion of cargoes consigned to the Continent, but even with these additions total importshave been well below programme.       Larger imports of feed grains are expected in the next few months, but as priority is being given to the shipment of wheat and flourthey may not materialise.    (Whereas 478,000 tons of U. s.a. maize.were .originallyscheduled to arrive, by the end of August,.only 203,000 tons, .or 42&apos;/j, are now expected by that date). *&apos;:&quot;.&apos; f&quot;^ &apos;*&apos;    &quot;&apos;The oilcake position is relatively more satisfactory;   imports, includingdiverted cargoes, have since April been in excess of programme,     a purchase of14,000 tons of decorticated cottonseed cake has been made from Brazil to offsetpartially the loss of supplies of undecorticated cake from Egypt;- another 25,000 tonswill be purchased in Brazil1 for August/September shipment-if freight space is available.The new home crops&apos; of barley and pats, part of which will be available inAugust, are forecasted at 1,015,000 tons-and 2,774,000 tons, Compared with the1934/38 averages of 770,000 tons and 1,987,000 tons respectively.   &quot;Hay production, although of exceptionally high quality, may have beensmaller than last year.     The prolonged drought gave a serious set back to fodderroots, the output of which, despite increased acreage, has been tentatively put at less than last year. - It is, however, too early to forecast with any confidencethe probable outturn, and we may be agreeably surprised at the Improvement effected&quot;ky the recent increase in rainfall,(The following note of warning should perhaps be recorded here:     TheMinistry estimated in May last that 17,4 million tons of&apos; foods and animal feedswould be required in  the second year of war to provide a reasonable diet for the human population and to maintain the livestock population at its existing level.The tentative forecasts of home-produced crops upon which that estimate was tEredicated included ah&apos;allowance for an 8% increase over 1939 in the output-ofroots), - &quot; .   &apos;     .-; :., -      , n \..\ :v, Releases for consumption of oilcakes and imported cereal feeds continueto be restricted to the wartime summer level, arid substantial effect is &quot;being given to the policy of making advance allocations for storage&apos; by provender jiiiliers,compounders, millers and distributing dealers throughout the country.
About 200,000 tons of imported feeding cereals have already been dispersed for storage under this plan.  &apos;  In addition, advance allocations for. storage of&quot;straight&quot; calces and meals are&apos; being made to farmers.. .As the manufacture of compounds is restricted, there is a substantial     .reserve of -productive capacity available, in compounding and provender mills.    The&apos;full capacity and normal output, of each of these mills is known,, and in the event   &quot;of stoppages&apos; due to enemy action arrangements will be made to maintain production. -A small compounding mill was destroyed on 9th June, but&apos;the necessary re-arrangement of manufacturing was made within two days.4.    OILSEEDS AND HUTS;    VEGETABLE AND MARINE OILS&quot; Vegetable; &apos; Oilseeds   -     oils ,..(thousand tons)Total U.K. stocks on 29th June 272 72 328Estimated U.K. weekly consumption (July) .  59 16 -  it is estimated that about 220 thousand tons of oilseeds,and about   &apos;   .24 thousand tons of oils and fats will be obtained from.foreign, cargoes (includingFrench) diverted to U.K. ports.   These windfalls, which have been estimated on avery conservative basis, exceed the reduction iri &quot;programme arrivals1&apos; due to the closing of the Mediterranean and the consequent longer journey to this country..Stocks of vegetable oils together with the oil content of oilseed stocks areexpected at the end of September to be 23)8 greater than at the end of June.Efforts are being made to disperse more widely the stocks of crude whale oilowned by the Ministry.     During June and the early part of July the quantity held inLondon was reduced from 125 thousand tons to 40 thousand tons, the stocks at westcoast ports being increased.     Over 70 thousand tons are still held in. Americanports.Progress is being made in the erection of the oil hardening plant at. Barry.A number of storage tanks are already completed but the plant is unlikely to beready for use&apos;until November or December, ;5.   MARGARINE AND LARD &apos;Direct control by the Ministry of the margarine and cooking fats industriesbegan on 14th July and rationing of these commodities was introduced on 22nd July.It is too early to estimate the extent to which the 6 oz. ration will be taken upin terms of butter and margarine respectively, but provisions are being made on the .assumption that margarine will be purchased to the extent of not less than one-halfof the joint ration.:    Similarly, it is expected that the 2 oz. cooking fats&quot;ration (or margarine in lieu) will be divided equally between margarine and cooking fats. ...Trade users of these commodities and of edible oils are being restricted inJuly to 75^ of their &quot;datum&quot; consumption (i.e. l/6th of their February-July 1939utilisation), except in the&apos;case of the baking and fish frying industries which will receive 10O/b of the same &quot;datum&quot;.It is intended that the pre-ratiohing rate of production of margarine and cooking fats will be maintainedj   the savings, estimated at about ICyo, resultingfrom rationing will increase stocks (to equal, it is hoped, 6 weeks&apos; consumption-of margarine and 4 weeks&apos; of compound lard).6.    MEAT(imported only)Total G.B. stocks on 29th June ...    157,000 tons -Estimated weekly consumption (July) 22,200     &quot;.      --   Imports of meat in June were substantially below programme, but the deficiencyis likely to be made good by arrivals in excess of programme in July and August. and -will be supplemented by some of the 17,750 tons which were afloat for Prance at,the date of her capitulation.No contract has yet been made with Argentina covering&quot;&quot;the shipping period april to August, and the Ministry are still awaiting a reply to their representations made, two months ago,     -     . -  - - &apos; ......-&apos;&quot;&apos;-!-&apos;-&apos;.-       &quot;    4, &apos;&apos;-Whaleoil
The recently increased (short terra) prices for home-produced fat cattle,which have &quot;been adjusted so as to discourage high finish and thus reduce the demandfor feeding-stuffs, may induce some additional slaughterings in the next few weeks,particularly as long term prices, which are under consideration by the Livestockpolicy Committee, have not been announced.     There is no reason to believe, however,that current prices have increased the slaughtering (as in the early months of thewar when prices were decontrolled) of in-calf and other cows.About 45,000 tons&apos; of corned beef, which commodity is still reserved forthe Services and emergencies^ are expected to arrive in July and August.7.   BACON AND HAMTotal G,B. stocks on 29th June 31,500 tons estimated weekly consumption (July) 7,400   &quot;Releases of bacon and ham for consumption by the general public in thethree weeks following the reduction on June 10th in the bacon and ham ration from to 4 oz, per head per week averaged about 20^ less than in the three precedingweeks.     This reduction in releases was, however, also attributable to the effecton consumer demand of recent releases of some Danish bacon in poor condition and by the trade reducing their stocks during hot weather.     This comparison doesnot give a true indication of the reduction in civilian consumption, however, as these releases include the quantities9 which probably increased appreciably during june, consumed by soldiers (ration,14 oz. per week) billetted in households.Stocks of bacon and ham in cold store at the end of June were only slightly abovethe 18,000 tons regarded as a suitable summer level and are expected to declinebelow that level in July and August.Recent \weeks * pig marketings have tended to decline, and have increased the difficulty in obtaining sufficient pigs of acceptable bacon weights.     Marketingsof sows do not so far indicate any substantial reduction in breeding stocks.8.   SUGAR.tons total UeK. stocks on 29th June &quot; 460,000Estimated weekly consumption (July) 38,000It was reported last month that additional purchases of 500,000 tons of sugar had been authorised.     Of this quantity 238,000 tons have already been purchased in Java and Cuba, the whole of which is due to arrive by October.Negotiations for a purchase of 200,000 tons from British India are in suspencepending removal of certain difficulties which have arisen in India.Approximately 55,000 tons, originally consigned to the Continent has arrived in U.K. ports, and a further 60,000. tons of this &quot;distressed&quot; sugar isexpected.     The latter quantity is not included in the forecast stock position.The utilisation of sugar during July and August is likely to beexceptionally heavy because of.special allocations of 60,000 tons a month for domestic and factory fruit preservation.     The forecast of total stocks shows a fallduring August but a recovery to 400,000 tons at the end of September.9&apos;   .M&amp;LK. , &apos;   .Consumption (74 million gallons) of liquid milk in the United kingdom during June was almost the same as &quot;in June 1939,     There was a very small declinein England and Wales (equal to the reduction in consumption under the milk in schools scheme) whilst Scottish sales were higher than in June 1939 by 0,6 million gallons or 7.5^o.    Sales in Northern Ireland were down by 5,7^,The first deliveries under the free and/or cheap milk scheme for expectantand nursing mothers and young children began on 14th July.     Considerablepublicity was given to the scheme during the following week as a result of which an immediate large increase in the number of participants is expected.The Ministry has set up a committee to advise on the steps to be takento reduce the costs of milk distribution.     It will report in time for economies in distribution to be made as from the end of September^
The quantity of milk used for manufacturing purposes in June was 6.5 million gallons less, than in June 1939, the main changes being reductions in the quantitiesused for butter and cream and small increases for condensed and dried milk,,The allocation of milk for manufacturing purposes is based on a system of priorities, Iin August the products at the head of the priority list were:- (1) butter-makingby firms capable of manufacturing skim condensed milk in tins (2) cheddar cheeseand (3) full cream condensed milk.10. CONDENSED MILK.Following the loss of Dutch supplies of condensed milk, voluntary arrangements were made whereby the quantities distributed to wholesalers and retailers were restricted.     In June the quantity distributed to wholesalers wasonly 45fo of their 1938 average monthly requirements, but part of the balance forconsumption was made up by reductions of stocks held by wholesalers and retailers,,The restriction on sales is being continued in July and as a precaution againstuneven distribution, it is proposed to compel wholesalers to limit supplies toretailers on a similar &quot;datum&quot; basis,,Approximately 30s000 tons of full-cream unsweetened condensed milk arebeing purchased in the U. S0Aa, the bulk of which will arrive in August and September.These supplies, together with part of the home produced product will enable a stockto be built up to meet the winter demand when home production falls considerably.11*   BUTTER.tons total stocks in GSB0 on 29th June 56,000Ministry&apos;s stock on 29th June 49,000Estimated weekly consumption in G.B.; (July)        5,500 &apos;On the assumption that the combined ration of butter and margarine willnot result in any material change in butter consumption, no difficulty is anticipated in obtaining sufficient butter to meet the assumed demand during the coming winter.Owing to the seasonal decline in Southern Hemisphere shipments, a drop in bulkstocks in October/November to about 35,000 tons is expected, but thereafter asubstantial increase should take place.The actual consumption of butter by householders since the 4 oz. rationwas instituted has averaged about 3-g- ozs, per head per week,.12.    CHEESE.tons total stocks in C-.B, on 29th June 17,000Estimated weekly consumption in.GffB. (July)     3,700Shipments of cheese are being accelerated and, assuming consumptionremains stable, total stocks are expected to increase rapidly, from 4.6 weeks&apos; supply at the end of June to 10.5 at the end of September.The U,S. Government have decided against granting an export subsidy onoheese because there is no substantial surplus and because they are anxious toavoid establishing a precedent which might well be exploited by the powerfulpolitical lobby maintained by the butter interests.     Without an export subsidythere is no hope of tlae Ministry purchasing UeS. cheese at a price in line withthe average Dominions7 price.     Enquiries are, however, being made regarding thepossibilities of including cheese in a barter arrangement.During June and July home production of-cheese is at its seasonal peakand is capable of providing about one third of the normal total consumption inthose monthsB     Cheese production is high on the list of priorities for the utilisation of milk not required for liquid consumption^
13,    EGGS AMD EGG- PRODUCTSSupplies of eggs in June 1940 were only about 63% of those of June 1939(home production 79%j imports 42%).position.Supplies from:(i) home production(ii) cold store and pickle(iii) enemy-controlled areas(iv) other sourcesTotalsAt the end of June stocks of eggs in cold store and pickle, excluding storagein private households, amounted to 1.1 million great hundreds.     The quantity storedin private households is unknown,    but is believed to be more than double thenormal quantity.     Releases for consumption from bulk stocks will begin in October,thus alleviating the shortage of home produced eggs and partially replacing the cheaper grades ,of eggs formerly obtained from the Continent.The shortage of eggs in June caused a hardening of prices, and at the endof the month retailers were charging the maxima permitted by the Home ProducedEggs (Maximum Prices) Orders.     The average of retail prices during the month was approximately 45% above the level of June 1939,The scheme for controlling the distribution of imported eggs throughnormal trade channels working on fixed price margins is expected to be in full operation by 1st September,Imports of egg products in January/June 1940 were about 18,000 tons,35% higher than in the first half of 1939.     For July/December shipping provision has been made for the import of 39,000 tons from China, which is also approximately35% higher than imports from all sources in the same period of 1939.14.    TEA&apos;  Total U.K.  stocks on 29th June 126 million lbs.Estimated U.K, weekly consumptionincluding exports (July) ; 8.0      &quot;        &quot;Estimated TJ.lv. weekly consumptionincluding exports (August) 7.4       &quot;        11Tea  rationing came into force on July 9th with a ration of 2 oas. per head per week.     The effect is estimated to be a reduction to 70% of the rateof consumption immediately prior to rationing.     Bulk stocks which, withoutrationing, would have fallen to less than 75 million lbs. by the end of Augustare now forecast at about 100 million lbs, at that date.     In subsequent monthsthere will be a rapid increase in stocks if the present shipping programme can be  fulfilled.Negotiations are in course of completion for a purchase of 40 million lbs.of tea from Java to be shipped at an early date, as and when shipping is available.No account of this quantity has been taken in the forecasts of the stock positionup to the end of September..The following table summarises the forwardJuly/Sept ember             Oct ober/Decembernormal    Anticipated   normal     anticipatedpre-war        1940         pre-war        1940...........million great hundreds .........8.5 5.7 7.4 4.3.3 nil 1.5 1.56.1 nil 5.2 nil.8 1.2 2.3 7.615.7 6.9 16.4 13.4
15.      FISH.The landings of fish in June were 540,000 cwtv, a reduction of 67&apos;ycfrom June 1939.     Landings in July and August are expected to he only 30-55fo of normal.The curing of herrings is now subject to licence control, and licencesare being issued only to those who agree to cure on the Ministry&apos;s behalf.Of the 10,000 tons of canned salmon and the 2,000 tons of canned pilchardsto be bought from U.S.A. as an emergency reserve, about half has already been purchased and is expected to arrive in this country before the end of August.16.     DRIED FRUIT.The balance of the Australian crop has now been purchased; since thebeginning, of the war in all 51,000 tons have been bought by the Ministry from australia, part of which will not arrive until after August.Stocks now in the hands of the trade should be adequate for the next twoor three months and the Australian purchase, if completely distributed, should provide some 60^ of the supplies necessary for the Christmas shopping season.The future supply position is, however, still obscure since it depends on thepossibility of obtaining supplies from Greece and Turkey or alternatively the useof dollars or a barter arrangement to procure dried fruit in the U..S.A.17.     RICE.Total U.K. stocks on 29th June 58,000 tons estimated weekly consumption (July) 4,800     &quot;Actual and anticipated imports of rice in June, July and Augustapproximate to programme (25,300 tons) and are expected to be supplemented byprize cargoes and diversions amounting to about 19,000 tons.     In addition, afurther.43,500 tons are afloat from Saigon, Indo-China and Brazil and, althoughthe ultimate destination is still uncertain, a substantial part of this may alsoreach this country.Much of the diverted rice is of low grade which neither brewers norstarch makers can use, but it has been sold to distillers who are able to utiliseit in conjunction with Canadian barley.The average retail price of Rangoon rice has risen from 2.7d per lb.from the beginning of September 1939 to 3.5d. per lb. at the beginning of July1940, an increase of 30^ compared with an increase of 22/o for all food itemsincluded in the Ministry of Labour&apos;s cost of living index.     The increase in price is accounted for by the increase in cost of freight and insurance.18.     POTATOES.The withdrawal from the Channel Islands resulted in a loss of - about35,000 tons of early potatoes which would normally have reached this country.Home-produced, supplies were; however, sufficient to meet the demand and, apartfrom a deficiency of large potatoes for fish friers, no serious difficulties were experienced.The acreage under potatoes in Great Britain is 14,6^ larger this year than last and, assuming (it is too early to estimate) a moderate unit yield, themain crop in Great Britain is tentatively put at 4.7 million tons as comparedwith 4.4 million tons in 1938 and 1939 (in both, of which years the unit&apos; yieldwas above average).     Production in allotments and private gardens, which is not allowed for in the foregoing figures, is expected to be much larger than lastyear.     The potato acreage in Northern Ireland is also considerably largerthis year.8o
19.    VEGETABLES.  .-Arrangements have been made whereby local committees of the national farmers Union have been set up to transfer surpluses to deficit areas.     where necessary, especially in emergency cases, these committees will send consignmentsto wholesalers in the large towns. ......The problem of surpluses of fruit and vegetables produced on allotmentsand in private gardens is being met by (a) allowing sales to be made without theusual retail licence (b) setting up, through the County Federation of Women1 sInstitutes, collecting centres in rural areas where numerous small lots can begraded and passed on to the distributive trade and (c) encouraging allotmentsocieties in urban areas to act as collecting centres.20.    BREWING AND DISTILLING.Supplies of barley to the brewing industry are restricted so as to limitits production to the same as in the year ended 30th September 1939. and to thedistilling industry so as to reduce its putput in the calendar year 1940 toone-third of its production in 1938/39.     Altogether these industries utilisedin 1938/39 nearly 950,000 tons of cereals (including barley, rice, rice grits,maize, grits etc,,), brewing accounting for 696,000 tons and distilling253,000 tons;.     The output of spirits from cereals in the calendar year 1940will be about one-third of 1938/39.     The output of beer has fallen as a resultof the increases in the excise duty on beer in September, 1939, and April, 1940,and for the nine months October to June, 1939/40 is about 3/  less than in thesame period. 1938/39. .   This decline in. output is somewhat less than had been anticipated owing to increased spending power.in.industrial and munition areas and to the return of.-the British Expeditionary Force from France21.    SHIPPING.The capitulation- of France and other factors have resulted in a material increase in the supply of shipping and the Ministry of Shipping hasallocated additional space to the Ministry of Food.     Thus an extra 300,000 tonsof shipping from the Argentine has been obtained and is being used to add to our stocks of wheat and canned meat,     Similarly, in Java an additional allocation of 130,000 tons is being used to augment our sugar and tea supplies.Further gains have been and are: still being obtained by the diversion to the United Kingdom of cargoes originally consigned to countries now occupiedby the enemy,. the. total for the first year of war being tentatively put, on a conservative basis, at 626,000 tons (i.e. about J,% of arrivals from all sources).Against these gains, however, must be set the increased losses at sea.     In the month of June 64,000 tons of foods and animal feeds were sunk -about the same as was lost in the first month of the war - and in the first week of July alone sinkings were 48,000 tons.     In estimating arrivals up to theend of August no allowance has been made for possible sinkings, on the assumptionthat these will be largely, if not wholly, offset by additional diverted cargoes.22.    ANGLO-FRENCH COLLABORATION.Following the decision on 4th July 1940, to dissolve the Anglo-FrenohCo-ordinating Committee, the Anglo-French Food Executive was dissolved as fromthe same date.     Outstanding questions are being dealt with by the Ministry ofFood and the nucleus of the French Food Mission which remains, for the timebeing, in London,The surrender of France and part of the French Colonial Empire willhave no adverse effect upon supplies of imported foodstuffs,except possibly inthe case of dried beans from Madagascar.     On the contrary, the chief effect
will be to aggravate the already severe problem of the disposal of the surplusesof primary foodstuffs in territories under allied control.     trench West andEquatorial Africa will have available very large supplies of cocoa, oilseeds and vegetable oils whilst the French West Indies and Oceania can provide substantial quantities of sugar, bananas and copra,, r23.    The Consumer.Konth by month the war brings the Ministry of Food into closer and more frequent contact with the 46.4 million civilian consumers;   the housewifebecomes daily more aware of the Food Front.     The Ministry&apos;s activities now impingevery directly on many of the food habits and also upon the nutritional well-being of the consumer.Retail Food prices the Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of retail food prices rose by 10 points,or about 6%, between 1st June and 1st July,     This is the largest monthly increasesince last September.     It is mainly due to increases in the average prices of potatoes (which account for about 7 of the total of 10 points increase) and milk,but there were also slight increases in the prices of eggs and fish.     A sharprise in the price of potatoes is usual at this season when new potatoes take theplace of old, but it was accentuated this year by the&apos; prolonged drought andthe unexpected cessation of imports from the Channel Islands.     While the realincrease in the retail price of food between,&apos;1st September 1939 and 1st June 1940was probably considerably greater than the 14,5)0 shown by the Ministry of Labour&apos;sindex (the prices of many foods commonly consumed but not included in the indexhave risen more than the prices of many of those included), it is&apos; improbable thatthe real increase in expenditure on food in June was as great as the index shows.When new potatoes are scarce and expensive the average low-income householdpurchases fewer potatoes and more of other vegetables.Prices of potatoes should fall substantially as the main crop comes onto the market.     An increase of -gdo a lb. will probably be necessary in the retail price of granulated sugar in the near future:   this will raise the foodindex by 1,4 -points and the &apos;all items&apos; figure by 0.8 points.     Egg prices must also be expected to continue their seasonal increase.     A loss is now being incurred on tea and some rise in average prices may be necessary in the course .of the summer.Other important factors likely to affect the.future course of retail prices are the recent increases in producers&apos; prices and in liner rates of freight.     No precise information is yet available on the. latter point.     the changes in agricultural prices (which, if maintained throughout 1940/41, are estimated to increase farmers&apos; aggregate receipts by about  32-g- millions) ifthey were to be completely passed on to the consumer would be equivalent tothe following estimated changes in retail prices:

The increase shown for milk is the estimated amountby which the retail price would have to be raised in August and september in order to pay an additional Igd. per gallon to producersfor the months July/September on the assumption that manufacturingprices remain unchanged.HutritionThe dietary constituents in which we may be approaching the deficiency line for the average consumer (and therefore falling below thatline for the poorer households) appear to be calcium and vitamins a and 31.The Vitaminisation of all margarine (including the variety sold at 5d. per lb.,) and the intended addition of vitamin 31 and calcium salts to breadshould, if no price rise is involved, help to remedy this deficiency.   Thefree and cheap milk scheme for nursing and expectant mothers and children under 5 (if it is widely used), together with the ministry1 s polic3&apos;- of keeping down the price of certain of the cuts and types of meat, margarineand .3am, etc. normally consumed by the poorer classes and keeping up theprice of those types normally consumed by the higher income grades, shouldrender additional assistance.In order that the nutritional well-being of the lower income gradesmay be kept under continuous review, arrangements have been made to conductquarterly a food consumption enquiry covering 2,000 working class householdsIn. different parts of the country.       The possibility of conducting detailedscientific dietary studies in a smaller sample of households is underconsideration.     Several experiments on&quot; the Oslo meal, which providessufficient vitamins and minerals for one day, and on ether nutritional aspectsof ca-mmuoal feeding are in progress or under consideration,\far-1iraie Cooking and Sating j-kibits.The kitchen technique and burring habits of the housewife are also being studied.     Propaganda campaigns have been conducted by (a) pressadvertising, (b) the cix-speculation to editors and housewives of leaflets on&quot;how to eat wisely in war-time&quot;., and &quot;wise housekeeping in war-time&quot; andrecipes -for war-time dishes.     Experiments have been made in the preparation and cooking of salted herrings (the supply of which is likely to be ampleowing to the loss of export markets) and also on methods of utilising as humanfood cereal grains normally fed to livestock.The llinistry&apos;s District Pood Education Officers have stimulatedlocal organisations to arrange demonstrations of war-time cookery, windowdisplays, exhibitions and to set up enquiry bureaux, thus creating new consumerinterest in war-time cooking, anti-waste and food education.       In addition,stops are being taken to educate factory workers through their canteens.
Public Relations.The general public is being kept well informed regarding the actions of the Ministry through the press, radio and a variety of other channels.     Thevarious aspects of rationing, the cheap milk scheme, paper economy in shopping,the making of jam and preserves, and the growing of vegetables for winter usehave all been covered in recent publicity campaigns.The commodities now (July 22nd) rationed to individuals are:-Per head per weekMeat 1/I0d. worth (if lbs)Bacon - 4 ozs.Butter and/or Margarine 6   &quot;Cooking Pats (or margarine in lieu) 2   &quot;Tea &apos;                                                 &apos; 2   &quot;Sugar 8   &quot;These and other commodities are also rationed to manufacturers and caterersexcept in the case of tea.The recent reductions in the butter, bacon and sugar rations have beenaccepted by the public without serious complaint.     Investigations are under wayinto the actual quantities of the rationed commodities consumed and also intothe effect of tea rationing on the demand for coffee and cocoa,.Communal Feeding.The possibilities of communal feeding generally, and particularlyin emergency conditions, are being explored.     Experiments, including theestablishing of two National Kitchens, are in hand to ascertain the type of organisation needed and a survey is being made of existing catering and otherCommunal feeding facilities.
REPORT Oil FOOD PRODUCTION(By the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in conjunction with the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for the Home Department)15th July, 1940sCjTfiB -^ IL^iJiJ:0-?^-;_______   England and Walesj      July.J.st.Corn yields are expected (provisionally) to be somewhat belowaverage, as follows: wheat 9k% of normal.., barley 9k%, oats 3&amp;fos beans Q3%peas 9&amp;%    In the case of wheat the damage v/as mainly done in the winter andthe crop has been improving latterly.    The other grain crops have been affectedby drought, inseot pests and weeds&apos;., &apos; The straw is also likely to be short.Potatoes, are expected to produce 97$ of normal yield, and are a healthy crop.Sugar beet is also a healthy crop0    Early sown turnips are doing well but latersown have suffered from lack of rain;    the same applies to mangolds and greenfodder.   Generally.all&apos; crops need rain.Drought has also affected the June cuts of hay which produce thebulk of the crop,    Seeds hay is expected to produce 99% of a normal yield andmeadow hay only 90$,   The feeding value per ton is, however, higher than usual.Some farmers are reported to have taken lighter hay crops this spring than theymight have done, since they intend to make silage later in the season.Grass has been very scarce for the time&quot;of year, and while livestockare in good condition,, milk yields have been difficult to maintain.    UnlessJuly is a wet month.,, the June, drought may lead to a distinct shortage of grassin July and August.Crop Conditions;. : ScotlandAn average yield of grain is expected., but the straw will be short.The hay crop is ,an average one of fine quality., Potatoes, roots and pasturesneed rain.    Cattle show the effects of drought but lambs are thriving.The yield of the principal crop - oats - is expected to be wellup to average.    Potatoes, flax and barley are making a satisfactory showing.Good hay yields of excellent quality are reported from most districts.Steps have been taken to strengthen the War Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees in England and Wales by adding technical staff and in some casesaltering the composition of Committees^    Liaison.Officers have been appointedto act as personal representatives of the Minister of Agriculture.    committees are making good progress with the survey of farms.Tile drainage is now eligible for grant and the procedure for grantaiding all kinds of farm drainage, including ditching, is now uniform.    Anumber of Agricultural Executive Committees in England and Wales have appointedspecial officers to assist in the improvement of grassland,    A semi-derelictproperty of 600 acres has been acquired by the Ministry and placed under thedirection of Sir George Stapledon for the purpose of demonstrating methods of improving heavy grassland of a representative type0In. Scotland action continues to secure the denser stocking of deerforests with cattle, and sheep,   Results so far are satisfactory.In England and Wales tenancy has been terminated on, or Executive/Committees
Committees have taken possession of 50*000 acres of &quot;badly used land.   A scheme has &quot;been started for making hard roads in an area covering 3*000 acres of fenland in Cambridgeshire (where roads are a limiting factor in food production).War&apos; time allotments have been provided to the number of 264,000 inGreat Britain, the acreage being 20,200 acres,   Further efforts are being madeto increase the area, and local authorities will be permitted to takepossession, if necessary, of gardens of unoccupied houses,Orders have been made prohibiting the use of land for the artificial hatching or rearing of pheasants except under licence,Gener^al^Bgl-icvQuestions of what crops should be emphasised in the 1940/41programme are under review, and the Agricultural Departments propose to make more specific the directions given farmers to grow those crops decided upon.Directions are also to be given more freely and made more definite, especially to remedy conditions on backward farms,,    The improvement of grassland willalso figure more prominently in the 1940/41 campaign,   A forthcoming bill will seek powers for the Agricultural Executive Committees to do themselves the work specified in a direction if the farmer has disobeyed it and recoverthe cost from the farmer,,The precise extent to which the tillage area in England and wales is to be increased in 1940/41 will be calculated when information resultingfrom the survey is received,    Scotland has already announced an objective ofan additional 260,000 acres.The new scales of prices appear to have given satisfaction generally.There remains, however, the difficult problem of the undercapitalisation of farms.Machinery,Arrangements have been completed satisfactorily for the distribution to Committees of reaper-binders, and a reserve is being accumulated oftractors and implements for the autumn,   The Ministry&apos;s purchases and commitments to date amount to approximately  2,000,000,    Committees have beenasked to make the necessary arrangements for training additional tractordrivers.In Scotland binders are being delivered to the Department and thestock of tractors is being augmented,    Harvest trailers are also being constructed.    Committees are taking orders from farmers who expect to requireassistance.In Northern Ireland courses of instruction in binder work have been organised.    The 70 flax pulling machines on order in Belgium which fell intothe hands of the enemy are being replaced locally.Generally, the Departments will be concerned to see that the mostwidespread use is made of all machinery - that in the hands of Committees,contractors and farmers alike - and that an adequate supply of trained labour is available,Fertili sers^ and SeedsIn the fertiliser year just ended the consumption of nitrogenousfertilisers was 23 per cent, higher than a year previously, and of potassicfertilisers and basic slag, 20 per cent, higher.    Supplies of phosphaticfertilisers other than basic slag were maintained at the pre-war rate.   Theconsumption of&apos;lime declined by 1.5 per cent.    The Land Fertility Scheme, which provides grants for lime and basic slag, has been extended until July 31st,1941./Supplies
Supplies of potash will no longer &quot;be available from France, nor orphosphate rock from French North Africa.    But if shipping is available, it ishoped &apos;to bring enough phosphate rock from Mauru and neighbouring PacificIslands to secure an increase in the production of superphosphate.    It may alsobe possible to transport 100,000 tons of unground basic slag from dumps and works which have no grinding capacity to - others which have spare capacity.In consultation&apos;with the Ministry of Supply steps are being takento disperse fertiliser stocks by urging farmers to buy them in advance.As a. result of the; turn which the war has taken, certain types ofseeds will not be obtainable from normal sources abroadc    Seed for carrots,onions, peas and winter beans will.be in short supply,, . It is hoped, however,to obtain more seed from New Zealand and the U. So A.    . ,Man PowerSo far there has been no exceptional demand for labour;    this is areflection of the dry season and farmers&apos; . reluctance to take on additionalworkers at the increased wagesc   The comparative quiescence of demand isaffecting the placing of members of the Women&apos;s Land Army and of workers undervarious supplementary schemes, but an increased demand is likely in the courseof the next few weeks.    These supplementary schemes cover University students,school holiday camps, mobile gangs of. workers, conscientious objectors, aliensexempted from internment and also schoolgirls who are to be employed on fruitpicking in&apos; Scotland,,   A scheme for the training of boys leaving elementary schools has been launched and the Ministry has taken over responsibility for grants to the Y0M0C,A0 Training Scheme.    It is hoped under, these two schemes to train up to 3,000 boys a year for agricultural work.It has been agreed with the.Ministry of Labour that where as a resultof postponement of military service a man reaches 21 before being called up,he will be granted indefinite postponement if a key worker.All the County Wages Committees in England and Wales have now giveneffect to the new national minimum wage of 48/-, and related increases forwomen and juveniles have been made in most cases.    Lower wage rates are being allowed for newcomers into agriculture during their first two months - inthe case of male adults the\:rate of 38/-, an-abatement of just over 20 percent.    Similar arrangements have been made for members of the Women&apos;s land army and certain classes of boys.    In Scotland revised minimum wage rates will come into force on July 22nd.Feeding Stuffs and LivestockThe June drought by affecting the pastures has led many dairy farmers to feed oilcakes and other concentrates to maintain the milk output at theexpense of accumulating reserves for next winter.    In order to disperse thereserve stocks of oilcakes and meals, arrangements have been made to enablefarmers to acquire up to a month&apos;s normal supply as an advance allocation againstnext winter&apos;s requirements.    Similar arrangements for feeding grain and cerealmeals are under consideration.,An expert committee under Lord Moyne has been appointed to considerfuture livestock problems, including any arising out of a state of siege and requiring an abnormal slaughter of stock.After consultation with the Defence authorities it has been decided/that
that no general evacuation of livestock from coastal areas is practicable and that it should be limited to animals from farms taken over for military purposes.Milk Production.The following figures relate to the United Kingdom in millions ofgallons:-Liquid Manufacturing TotalJune 1939 74.1 56.9 130.9May 1940 74.0 5L7 125.6June 1940 73.9 50.4 124.3MiscellaneousThirty new local pig clubs have been formed, with a view to makingmore use of waste food.   Further developments are expected, especially a^ the urban sanitary regulations have been relaxed, and arrangements have been madefor providing the necessary supplement of purchased feeding stuffs.The Agricultural Departments in collaboration with the Home office have prepared for distribution a leaflet of advice on precautions against theeffects of incendiary bombs on crops.   Fire fighting equipment is to be madeavailable for dealing with crop fires and additional equipment has been provided in the main corn growing areas.A new regulation makes an offence the damaging of crops by sightseersin order to see the effect of enemy bombs and collect souvenirs.The bulb area is to be decreased by 25 per cent.    In conjunctionwith the Board of Trade, efforts are being made to take over the Dutch market for bulbs in the United States.Animal HealthThere has been no further outbreak of, foot-and-mouth disease sincethe last Report.    The swine fever figure remains high.
