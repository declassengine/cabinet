(THlH^i^^MT-iS-        PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET&quot; WAR   cabinet copy NO.W.F.(R) (40) 208REPORT FOR OCTOBER, 1940.3rd December 1 940The chief menace to the food position is the serious decline in arrivalsfrom overseas.     Total imports of foods, and feeds amounted to 1,599 thousand tons in August,    1,349 thousand tons in September,   1,050 thousand tons inOctober;   and the arrivals for November are likely to be still less.     the october figure is the lowest since the first month of the war,     The factorsprimarily responsible are shortage of shipping, sinkings, (90 thousand tons offoods and feeds in August, 72 thousand in September, 71 thousand in November)longer voyage times, and delays in discharge at ports.     These delays are due in large measure to disorganisation of internal transport which is thus a majorcause both of declining stocks and of the need&apos; for increased stocks if a givenlevel of consumption of any commodity is to be maintained.     Indeed, internaltransport is now probably the weakest point in the food supply position and isa matter for serious apprehension.For some commodities the reduction in shipments is enormous.     Riceimports during October were only one-third of programme.     Indian oil-seedsshipments for September and October were cut in half.     On the other hand,air raid damage to stocks of foods arrl feeds, which amounted to some 150thousand tons in September and some 25 thousand tons in October, was practicallynegligible in the first two weeks of November.Among the foods, the weakest points are milk, butter and eggs.Consumption of liquid milk in October 1940 was 15/3 greater than in October 1939,production \5% less.     Milk going to manufacturers is now under one-third of what it was a year ago.     In December there will probably be a milk deficiency forthe ordinary consumer of the order of 15$.     In order to conserve emergencystocks, condensed milk is being made available to consumers at only 40$ of pre-war quantities for full cream sweetened and 25$ or 20$ for other varieties.The supply of fats is like\vise passing through a difficult period.     The 2 oz.butter ration, supplemented by the increased ration of margarine, is being .maintained j   but the margin is a very narrow one.     An untoward sinking of ships now conveying butter from the Southern Hemisphere, or the destruction of anedible oil refinery or a margarine factory might render it difficult to maintainthe present rations.     The egg shortage continues,and, in a slightly modified,form, is likely to continue indefinitely.     Bulk stocks of eggs will be exhausted by Christmas,     Quantities at present available for consumption are40$ less than a year ago.Contributory to the milk deficiency, and partly responsible for theshortage of home-produced eggs, is the low ration of animal feeds.      Importedcereal feeds are being released at only 50% of the pre-war datum, oilcake at70%&apos;,   and even if the import programme were fully maintained, there would stillbe some falling off in stocks during the coming months.Refrigerated capacity presents an especially v/eak point, both for shipping and for storage.     Of 96 million cubic feet of refrigerated tonnage,14 millions have been sunk, and 22 millions requisitioned by the Admiralty.Of 37 million cubic feet of storage capacity in the country, about 3 millionhave been destroyed.     Two building programmes have been put on foot, each of5 million cubic feet,.     The first is now beginning to become available, whilethe second is at the stage where sites have been located.
Turning to the consumer aspect, the Ministry of Labourer ice index J? orfood was 25% higher on 1st November than at the outbreak of war.     There hasbeen an upward tendency of the index over the last three months, but thisshould now flatten out somewhat.     The price of potatoes may rise in december and the increased price of milk will make itself felt.     Against this, thereis the proposed reduction in retail sugar prices of 1d. per lb. and the seasonal decline in the price of eggs is due shortly.     Retail price increases-during the first yoar of war varied greatly.    The average price of nine food&apos;&quot;items selling below cost - bread, flour, home-killed meat (four cuts), bacon,tea and milk - increased by 10%;   of 21 other foods subject to price control by 3h- %\   and of 12 foods not subject to price control by 36%,There were no changes in rationing during October.     The presentallowance of 2 ozs. of tea and 8 ozs. of sugar represent a considerable reduction on the average pre -war consumption of 2.6 ozs. and 17 ozs.respectively.     The prospective tea and sugar stocks (of. chart attached)make a relatively favourable showing;   but the stock of tea actually underthe control of the Ministry is small (about 8-g- weeks&apos; supply at the presentrestricted rate of consumption), while the rapid increase in sugar stocksreflects the processing of the home crop and will be followed by a decline.It is hoped to maintain the increased   meat ration until after Christmas,but some reduction must be envisaged in the New Year.     Ihe whole rationingsituation necessarily depends in large measure upon the-rate of arrivalsduring the next few months, and it is here that the position is weakest.Neville House,Page Street, S.F.1.3rd Deoember, 1940,
