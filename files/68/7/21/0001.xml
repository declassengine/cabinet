(R)(kO) 201.51st October, 1940*WAR     cabinet food SITUATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.THIRTEENTH REPORT submitted by the Minister of Food for themonth of September, 194-0, incorporating the report on home production for the s ame period prepared by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries in conjunction with the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretaryof State for the Home Department.Copy No. h yW.Ministry of Food, S.W. 1.31st October, 194-0.

SUPPLY, CONSUMPTION, STOCKS, PRICES AND RATIONING,1.    OUTSTANDING FEATURESThe autumn food situation may &quot;be broadly summed up as strong on energyfoods, dubious on dairy products,, depleted in regard to tea, bacon, fruit andfish, and weak on transport, storage and programme-fulfilment.      The calorieindex of total stocks amounted at the end of September 194-0 to 22o0 weeks1supply, as compared with l607 in August 1940 and 13*7 in September 1939*     the forecast for end December (making no allowance for cargo losses and air raid damage) amounts to 21*6 weeks&apos; supply, as compared with 110 9 weeks at endDecember, 1939.Energy foods     Although the arrivals programme for November has beenreduced, the wheat and flour position for the rest of 1940 is likely to remainaround 17 weeks1 supply, With an increasing proportion available as flourfflThe potato crop promises to reach 4*8 million tons, as compared with 4^4 million tons in 19391     this not counting potatoes grown in gardens and allotments.    the sugar position is dependent upon the safe harvesting and processing of the homecrop and ,the arrival of imports  is plannedo     If these materialise there shouldbe 33 weeks1 supply in hand by the end. of Decembers     Rico imports for october-December are expected to be about 1+0% below programme&apos;, but this should still leave nearly 20 weeks&apos; supply in handsThe meat position remains adequate.     It should be possible to continuethe increased ration until DecemberoDairy products     The milk situation is becoming serious.     Productionin September 1940 was 14 per cent below that, of September 1939, while consumptionof liquid milk was 14 per cent above,     It is expected that practically the wholehome output during the winter months will be used as fresh milk, leaving nothing for manufacture.     Measures are being taken to conserve the stocks of condensed milk.   In particular the allocations to manufacturers of chocolate and sugarconfectionery are to be restricted, probably to 25% of pre-war requirements.Butter stocks, in spite of the reduction in the butter ration,, continue to fall;but whereas the depletion of stocks in September was nearly 15,000 tons, inOctober it should be less than 4.^000 tons.     As a result of the reduced butterration, margarine consumption has increased from 5,700-tons a week in september to 7,500 tons (estimated) in October.     In present circumstances margarineproduction can just hold .i*s own;   but there seems little prospect of improvingon present stocks, which amount to less than 2 weeks&apos; supply,.      Supplies ofsoft oils necessary for margarine manufacture, at present sufficient for 9 weeks,will be down to 5 weeks 1 supply by the end of the year.,     Cheese, consumption isrunning at the pre-war level.     If this continued the 25,000 tons controlled by theMinistry at end of September would fall to 14,000-15,000 tons (about 4 weeks&apos;supply) by end of January.     It has, therefore, been decided to restrict releases in November to 80% of the November 1939 consumption.     Egg stocks continue to decline and it is anticipated that towards the end of the year bulk stocks incold store or in pickle will be exhausted.     On the other hand., whereasconsumption for July-September was not much more than 50/q of the pre-war normal,that for October-December should be over 60%.Tea, bacon, fish and fruit     Tea stoe-ks are improving but are unlikely to reach normal proportions this years)     Bacon stocks are inadequate;20,600 tons (less than three weeks&quot; supplyj; but the rate of decline has beenreduced to 400 tons per week as against 1,000 tons a week in Augusts     Animprovement in the stock position may be expected in the next three months.Total supplies of fish during the second year of war are not likely to exceed450,000 tons against over one million tons pre-war.     Imports of fresh fruitREPORT FOR SEPTEMBER, 1940
(with the exception of oranges) and of fresh vegetables (apart from onions)are being drastically reduced.     Dried fruit is likely to remain at only 50% of normal supply until after Christmas.Shipping, storage and programme-fulfilment     Port congestion, largely due to the deviation of shipping from London, and the disturbance of railservices by air raids, is seriously lengthening the turn-around time of ships.      \The increase in voyage times since May, particularly of shipping that would normally come through the Mediterranean, is another serious hold up.     Sinkingsof food cargoes were less in September:   72 thousand tons, as against 90 thousandin August and 133 thousand in July.     During the first three weeks of Octobersinkings were a.gain on a heavier scale, totalling 66,000 tons.     Cold storagepresents an especially difficult problem, since half of the 34 million cubicfeet available is in London.     Arrivals of foods and feeds in the four monthsSeptember-December 1940 should aggregate 5,233 thousand tons, without allowing for future sinkings.     This is some 15% short of one-third of the Ministry&apos;simport programme for the second year of war.     Animal feeds are among those affected,imports of maize, barley and oilcakes all being substantially below programme.   Inspite of the fact that releases of cereal feeds are at only 50% and oilcakes at70% of pre-war datum level, stocks are declining.Air raid damage to foods and feeds up to 20th October amounted toconfirmed losses of some 84 thousand tons in London and 32 thousand elsewhere;and in addition estimated and doubtful losses aggregating some 65 thousand tons.Five per cent of the flour milling capacity of the U.K. has been destroyed, butunused capacity has been more than sufficient to make good this loss.     3*5% of theoilseed orushing capacity has been lost.2.    WHEAT, FLOUR AND BREAD(in tennis of wheat)Total ILK. stocks on September 28th 3,795,000 tons estimated weekly total consumption (October) 139,000     &quot;Estimated weekly consumption as flour (October)       125,000     &quot;Imports of Wheat and Flour in terms of wheat, averaged 131,000 tons per week inSeptember compared with 148,000 tons per week in August and 90,000 tons per week inJuly.     The tentative arrivals programme for November has been reduced from386,000 tons to 486,000 tons owing to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient freightfrom Canada.     Actual arrivals during October, November and December are expected tobe below even the revised programme.Reserve Stocks of Wheat and Flour increased from 16.0 weeks1 flour consumption atthe end of August to 17.1 on September 28th.     At the end of September total stocksof flour (including estimated retailers&apos; wholesalers1 and bakers&apos; stocks) were at about 8 weeks&quot; supply, the same as at the end of August.Total Stocks of Wheat and Flour are not expected to change to any extent duringthe next two months.      The proportion held as flour, however, should increase owingto increased flour imports from Canada and increased home production.The Milling capacity of the United Kingdom would be adequate at the present rateof consumption of home produced flour, viz. 80,000 tons per week, even if allthe large London and East Coast Mills -were out of action.     Working 120 hoursper week at 73% extraction, the industry&apos;s capacity at the end of August was94,000 tons per week, but by increasing the rate of input 5%) hy increasingextraction to QO% and by working 1^4 hours per week, the-weekly capacity wouldbe raised to 130,000 tons.     Five per cent of the industry&apos;s capacity was (as reported last month) lost by enemy action in September;   no further serious damage has been reported.The Marketing of the Home Crop has taken place unusually rapidly owing to the * &apos;excellent wea.ther for harvesting and threshing, and because farmers are unwilling to hold stocks for fear of air raid damage.     Controlled Millers were instructed on
October 5th to use at least 15% of home-grown wheat in their mixed grists.    Thecost of paying farmers to keep wheat in stack would prove too heavy, but theMinistry of Agriculture is now considering proposals for including home cropsvri.tb.in the Commodities Y/ar Risk Insurance Scheme.Emergency Arrangements for maintaining supplies of flour to bakers and of breadto householders have worked smoothly during the recent air raids on London.3.    ANIMAL FEEDS ,,-j*   - t000 tonsMaize Barley        OilcakesTotal U.K. stocks on September 28th 293 1,213 215Estimated weekly total consumption(including brewing and industrial uses)in October at the restricted rate (see para, on Releases below) 37 28 26Imports of maize, barley and oilcakes (at 135,000 tons, 17,000 tons and 16,000tons respectively) in September were lower than in August.      They are substantially below programme and are not. likely to reach programme level in the next threemonths.      The production of oilcake was also relatively low in September.Releases of cerea.1 feeds in October and November will, in order to conservesupplies, be at 50% of pre-war datum level.     During the same period oilcakesreleases will be 10fo of datum, but itv is hoped that supplies will permit the equivalent of a 100% release in December.Estimated total stocks of feeding-stuffs were equivalent (at the 1940/41anticipated winter rate of consumption) to 19.3 weeks1 supply at the end ofSeptember compared with 20.9 weeks&apos; at the end of August.     Forecasted stocks atthe end of December are 13.4 weeks&apos; supply.Stocks of oilcakes, however, equalled only 6.3 weeks&apos; supply at the end ofSeptember compared with 7*1 weeks1 at the end of August and a forecasted stock of 4*3 weeks&apos; supply at the end of December.     On September 28th, 11% of total stocks of cereal feeds and 57% of total stocks of oilcakes were in port districts.During September, compounding capacity in London equal to 6.3% of thepre-war national output and cereal product capacity equal to 4.2/o of pre-warnational output were totally destroyed by enemy action.     Other plants have been temporarily out of action.      The arrangements whereby the production or customersof damaged mills are transferred to sound mills are working reasonably well.4.    OILSEEDS AND NUTS, VEGETABLE   AND MARINE OILSOilseeds      Vegetable Whaleoil oil&apos;000 tons total U. K.  stocks on 28th September                      306               75 284Estimated U.K. weekly consumption (October)           31               15 2.8Imports of oilseeds during the remainder of 1940 are expected to be appreciably below crushing requirements and stocks are likely to decline.    Theprincipal difficulties are connected with the shipment of cotton seed from egypt and of groundnuts from India.     For manufacturing purposes, it is essential tomaintain a balance of hard oils (e.g.&apos; coconut and palm kernel- oils) and softoils (e.g. cotton seed and groundnut oils).      The present import difficultiesaffect the soft oils only.     It is estimated that by the end of 1940 the stock of these oils, including the oil content of seeds and nuts, will be reduced fromthe present level of 9 weeks&apos; supply to only 5 weeks&apos; supply, despite efforts to increase shipments from West Africa and the reduction of the quantitiesreleased to trade users, other than edible fat manufacturers.     Moreover, this
estimate assumes no losses at sea and in the United Kingdom and no further shijdelays.     The stocks of hard oils and linseed oil are, however, satisfactory.Damage to crushing mills and refining plant has not, so far,been sufficient to affect seriously the output of oils.     Crushing mills accounting for about 3&quot;5?o of the toted, capacity have been destroyed.     Temporary stoppageshave occurred at mills and refineries due to raid damage, lack of power ortransport difficulties.     Delays also occur during air raid alert periods owingto glass roofing.     In spite of these difficulties, however, the output, as awhole, has not been seriously affected^5.   MARGARINEA sharp increase in the demand for margarine followed the reduction inthe butter ration on 30th September to 2 ozs. per head per week.     Weeklymargarine requirements are now estimated at 7,500 tons a Yfeek compared with about,700 tons a week in September.Production during October is expected to average 8,000 tons a week.While an attempt is still being made to increase stocks, there is little prospectof any appreciable expansion.     Stocks of margarine at the beginning of Octobertotalled about 14,000 tons, less than two v/eeks1 supply.The margarine factory at Purfleet which was damaged by enemy air actionearly in September suffered, further damage on 12th October.     Production in thisplant was quickly resumed, but at a sub-normal level.     In spite of the damage to the Purfleet factory, total production has been maintained by increasing the out-turn at the Bromborough factory (these two factories normally accounted for two-thirds of the total supply) and, to some small extent, by utilising ice-creamplant for the production of margarine.6.   MEATTotal GoB, stocks on 28th September (imported only) 149,000 tons estimated weekly consumption (October) importedonly 16,400     &quot;Estimated weekly consumption (October) total 45,000     &quot;Imports and Stocks   As imports exceeded consumption of imported meat inSeptember, the stock position shows some improvement.     Negotiations are continuing with the principal exporting countries for second year of war imports.Supplies of Home Killed meat were nearly 30% heavier in September than in august and, as rex^orted last month, it has been necessary to restrict the number offatstook accepted at the Ministry&apos;s collecting centres.     The restriction onpig marketings has been removed and the percentage of offers accepted raised from80% to 30% in the ca.se of fat cattle, but only 60% of sheep offered are being accepted.     On the whole, farmers have not experienced serious difficulties in keeping on unaccepted stock.The distribution of esthmted consumption for September (4 weeks) was:Thousand tonsFighting Services 18. 2Manufacturers 9* 5Caterers B.0Civilians (a) on ration 113.0(b) pork 7*4(c) offal 16.6173.7
It is anticipated that the existing ration (which was increased to 2s.2d. from30th September) can be maintained until the end of the calendar year.The quantity of meat destroyed at sea or in the United Kingdom by enemy action in September was practically negligible.     The aerial Blitzkrieghas, however, raised several acute transport and storage problems.     London,which usually handles two-thirds of the country&apos;s imports, has not been usedsince early September; this has placed a great strain on west coast ports andon the inland transport suitable for meat especially as half the country&apos;s cold storage capacity is in London.     There has, however, been no breakdown in theconsumer&apos;s meat supply.Arrangements have been made for the continued purchase and slaughterof home produced fatstock in severe emergencies, whilst stocks of corned beef(which are in good condition) are available at strategic points.    These stocks are partly intended for issue if and when the ordinary meat supply breaks down,but small quantities have been issued through retail &quot;butchers against meatcoupons in areas where cooking facilities are temporarily not available and tolocal authorities for use in Emergency Feeding Centres.7.    BACON AND HAMTotal Stocks in Great Britain at September 28th 20,600 tons estimated weekly consumption (October) 7,500     &quot;Average weekly consumption during September was just under 8,000 tons, nearlyi+% below the August figure,.     Imports plus home production totalling 7,670 tons per week were slightly higher than in August.Stocks   declined during September by about 400 tons per week (including losses due to air raids) compared with a decline of about 1,000 tons per week in August.Present stocks are quite inadequate^     If no serious losses take place inGreat Britain or at sea, and the measures being taken to reduce consumption andto increase imports are successful, an improvement in the stock position may beexpected in the next three monthseThe negotiations for the renewal of the Canadian Contract, which expires onOctober 31st, are not yet complete;   neither the total quantity of imports(130,000 or 190,000 tons) nor the final price has been settled.     It has,however, been agreed that shipments should take place at the rate of 3,500 tons per week for the next three months.The maintenance of home production at its present level, which is approximatelya maximum, depends on the supply of bacon pigs.     No serious difficulty isanticipated in the next six months.     The provisional results of the census of pigs on agricultural holdings in England and Y/ales on 4th September, 1940, showa substantial decline in the number of breeding stock;   this will cause areduction in the pigs available for the market in the second part of 1941.    Thesupply of pigs for curing will not necessarily decline to the same extent, asthe new scale of prices should encourage farmers to sell their pigs for baconrather than for pork.Attempts are being made to reduce consumption by the suspension ofsupplies of Category &quot;C&quot; bacon (viz. bacon/ham intended for cooking or readycooked), the placing of hocks and fore-ends on the ration, and the reduction ofservice requirements by suspending, for two weeks in October, supplies toN.A. A. F. I.    who will draw from their stocks.     The Service ration will bereduced from 12 ozs. to 9 ozs. at a later date.Difficulties have arisen in the transport of bacon from the ports to cold stores and areas of distribution owing to the dislocation of therailwayso     Arrangements have been made to carry all bacon by road for an experimental period.
Interruption of supplies &quot;by enemy action at sea and in Great britain has been slight since the end of August.     At sea 2,700 tons have been lost and in Great Britain about Jfo of factory capacity has been put temporarily outof action.     As labour is for the time being the main factor limiting productionarrangements have been made for the transfer of labour from damaged to soundfactories,     Damage to stocks has been siighto8.    SUGARTotal United Kingdom stocks on 28th September 352,000 tons estimated weekly consumption including exports (October)    23,500 tonsAlthough a slight decline in stocks, occurred in September it isexpected that increased imports and home production will cause a considerable improvement in the stock position by the end of the year.     Present estimates of stocks under the control of the Ministry are as follows:1940Refined ValueEnd of August&quot;    &quot;   September&quot;    &quot;   October&quot;    &quot;   November&quot;    &quot;   December281,000 tons274,000   &quot;449,000   &quot;592,000    &quot;771,000   &quot;The processing of the home crop commenced in September and is -proceeding satisfactorily0 If the present favourable conditions continue thetotal home output is likely to bo larger than the allowance of 360,000 tons madein the above figures,Although the forecast of stocks at the end of December represents nearl33 weeks * supply at the present rate of consumption, it must be remembered thata large stock must be built up (a) to make good the lower rate of importationduring the spring and summer months and (b) to provide for seasonal fluctuations in consumption for jam and marmalade makings9.   MILKThe decline in the production of milk, reported last month, was evenmore marked in September;    the output, compared with September 1939, fell by16 million gallons or 14 per cent.      The marked decline in milk production inrecent months is attributable (i) to the effects of drought on pasture and(ii) insufficient concentrates for dairy herds.      The acceleration in the rateof decrease is shown in the following figures of production in the United Kingdom:MonthProduction (Mill, gallons)Increa.se or decreaseOctoberNovemberDecemberJanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJuly-AugustSeptember1938/39101. 591.088o790,085w99.9107-. 3130,6131.5128=3124&quot; 5114.11939/40107 c 791*486,984o278o 992*597,3I25c 9124*5119 06115s 498,1Milliongallonsn- 6,44- 0,4&apos; - 1,8- 5*8- 6o 8- 7o4- 10,0- 4,7- 7oO- 8.7- 9ol- 160 0orper cent6.30.42.06,580 07*49o33.65.36087,314*0
An even greater reduction is expected in October, the productionduring the first half of the month being about 18 per cent less than a year ago.The consumption of liquid milk again rose in September; in theUnited Kingdom as a whole it increased by nearly 10 million gallons or 14 percent compared with September 1939; and was higher than in any month previouslyrecorded.      It is expected that the total production during the winter months will be barely sufficient to satisfy the unrestricted needs of the liquidmarket, leaving nothing for manufacture.      Since some margin is essential toensure efficient distribution, it may be necessary to restrict consumption.Factors which have affected the quantity consumed in liquid form are (a) thenational free and cheap milk scheme,  (b) the shortage of condensed milk and(c) an increased demand due to air raids.10 -    CONDENSED MILKIn view of the expected decline in the output of liquid milk duringthe winter months, the home output of condensed milk during that period islikely to be small.     Action is, therefore, being taken to conserve existingstocks (a) by reducing supplies to food manufacturers and (b) by further restrictions on the quantities to be distributed for domestic consumption.The quantities to be allocated to manufacturers of chocolate and sugarconfectionery have not yet been settled, but it is expected that allocationswill have to be limited to not more than 25% of pre-war requirements.     Nosupplies are likely to be distributed to manufacturers of other products(excepting margarine).   Releases for domestic consumption will be reduced inNovember from 75% to 50% of normal for full cream sweetened, and from 50% to25% of normal for full cream unsweetened and machine skimmed condensed milk.11.    BUTTERTotal stocks in United Kingdom on 28th September 28,000 tons estimated weekly consumption (October) 3 ,,300     &quot;The decrease in the domestic butter ration to 2 ozs. per head per week from 30th September should have a marked effect on the stock position.    during september stocks fell by nearly 15 thousand tons, whereas in October, althoughimports are expected to be only 4 thousand tons larger than in the previous month, the reduction in stocks is estimated to be less than 4 thousand tons.Seasonal arrivals from the southern hemisphere should result in expanding stocksfrom November onwards, and, provided these imports materialize, an increasein the ration should be possible in December.12.    CHEESETotal stocks in United Kingdom on 28th September 36,000 tons estimated weekly consumption (October) 3,700     &quot;Ministry stocks totalled approximately 26,000 tons at the end ofSeptember.     In October, the first month of the operation of the Ministry&apos;control Scheme, releases were made on the basis of 100% of consumption in 1939.The maintenance of this rate of distribution, however, would have brought theMinistry&apos;s stocks to 14,000-15,000 tons by the end of January (including cheesein steamers discharging); in order to conserve stocks, and having regard to shipping delays and losses incurred through enemy action, it has been decidedto restrict November releases to 80% of the usage in November 1939*      Stocksshould increase materially between February and July.13.   EGGSSupplies   Home produced supplies of eggs are expected to follow their normalseasonal trend and to reach a minimum in November-,      September-January is,however, the period when supplies of eggs in shell from China usually reachtheir maximum, and when the supplies from the southern hemisphere are received,though this season some of the supplies from Australia may be postponed toFebruary 0     The supply of eggs from these sources has been very considerably increased as will be seen from the last item in the following table, whichsummarises the supply position:

TEATotal United Kingdom stocks on 28th September 55,000 tons estimated United Kingdom weekly consumptionincluding exports (October) 3,300     &quot;The reduction in the consumption of tea following rationing, combined with seasonal arrivals, enabled small increases in stocks to be effected in both August and September.    Some delay is, however, being experienced in arrivals, and imports in October and November are likely to fall short of the quantities originally expected.    Stocks of tea are unlikely to reach normalproportions this year, but despite the reduced rate of arrival a considerable expansion of supplies is expected.Considerable difficulty has been experienced in maintaining evendistribution of tea owing to transport delays and to reductions, due to air raids, in output from warehouses and by blending and packing plants.15.    DRIED FRUITThe Ministry&apos;s stocks of dried fruit, consisting largely of currantsand sultanas, are being released to the trade to the full amount available.A shortage of at least 50% of the normal supply is, however, likely to persistuntil after Christmas.    The present,supplies consist almost entirely of australian and South African fruit.    Negotiations are in progress for furtherpurchases of dried fruit from Turkey and Greece, but the issue of these negotiations, and the delivery of the fruit thereafter, if they are successful,remain problematical.     Further, supplies from Turkey and Greece could not inany event arrive before Christmas.16.   RICE&apos;000 tons total United Kingdom supplies on 28th September 52Estimated weekly consumption (October) 2.4Imports of rice in October-December are expected to be about 40% belowprogramme.    Discussions with the Dutch Colonial Administration have takenplace upon possible purchases of Java rice.&apos;   It is doubtful, however, whether any purchases will be made owing to difficulties over prices and freight.
The latest estimates indicate a crop of about 4.8 million tons compared with 4.4 million to.as.-in&quot;1939,     Minimum size restrictions on potatoesfor human consumption are being imposed in order to ensure adequate supplies of seed for next year&apos;s crop.     Controlled prices for seed potatoes are also likelyto induce growers to increase seed supplies.The expansion in the production of potatoes on allotments and in private gardens, together with the greater farm crop, will give scope foran increased consumption.     It is expected that their cheapness in relationto other foods, coupled with publicity by the Ministry, will stimulateutilisation.18.    FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLESImports of fresh fruit are being reduced drastically on account of(a) currency difficulties in North America (b) their semi-luxury character and(c) the need to conserve shipping space.     Attempts are being made to maintainimports of oranges on account of their nutritional value, but apple imports arelikely to suffer severely.     Imports of fresh vegetables, apart from onions,are regarded as. unessential.     Negotiations are in progress for the purchaseof onions from Spain, Chile and Argentina.     The Spanish negotiations have continued for three months but the high prices asked by shippers have so farprevented agreement.     An Order is in preparation, under which the maximum retail price of onions must not exceed 4-gd. per lb.19.   FISHBritish landings of fish during the second year of war are not expectedto exceed 300,000 tons compared with about 400,000 tons in 1939/40 and a pre-warannual average of about 900,000 tons.      Some small increase in imports may beobtained but this depends on supplies from Newfoundland, Nova Scotia andIceland compensating for the loss of normal imports from Norway, Denmark andthe Netherlands.     Total supplies are unlikely to exceed 450,000 tons againstover one million tons per annum before the war.The importation of frozen cod fillets will be taken over by the Ministryof Food on 1st November 1940.     Efforts will be made to obtain the largest possible quantities from Iceland, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.     It is expectedthat a large proportion of these supplies will go to fish fryers.The maximum wholesale price of frozen cod fillets will be fixed at11s.6d, per stone and the maximum retail price at Is. 3d. per pound comparedwith current prices of 17s. per stone and ls.8d. to 2s.2d. per lb. respectively.The Ministry anticipate that it will be able to obtain a reasonable profiton the whole transaction.    It is proposed to introduce a maximum price for allcod fillets, fresh and frozen, to prevent profiteering.     The possibilityof introducing price control for white fish generally is under consideration.Emergency arrangements have been made to ensure the continuity of thedistribution of fish in the event of serious difficulties, on the principle thatthe trade should be assisted to function as normally as possible.    Details ofa plan for the complete control of distribution in the event of the tradecollapsing are, however, being discussed.Difficulties have occurred on the transport of fish to the south coast owing to the air attack on London; they have, however, been, overcometo a considerable extent.Stocks of canned salmon in the United Kingdom on 28th September wereequivalent to just over 5. months&apos; supply at the September rate of consumption.If goods afloat and for shipment arrive safely the situation at the end ofDecember should be similar.
Considerable difficulty has been experienced in completing thearrangements for the control of starch.      Control will not bo introduced until 1st December.Negotiations have been concluded for the supply of 20,000 tons ofUnited States maize starch during the period November-March&apos; 1940/41.     this represents a considerable reduction in the rate of imports from the unitedStates during the past five months.    The deficit will have to be made good byimporting other starches, mainly from the Par East.Our starch stocks are being more widely dispersed, particularly thosein London,     In addition, an attempt is being made to increase the quantityof starch produced at home from imported maize and broken rice.21.    SHIPPINGArrivals of food and feed in September (excluding diverted cargoes,unrefined whale oil, livestock and beer) amounted to 1,349 thousand tons comparedwith ls599 thousand tons in August, 1,282 thousand tons in July, 1,620 thousand tons in June and 1,856 thousand tons in May,     Anticipated arrivals in the four months September to December are estimated (without allowing for future sinkings)at 5,233 thousand tons, which is 922 thousand tons less than one-third of theMinistry&apos;s import programme (excluding unrefined whale oil, livestock and beer).Sinkings in September were, at 72 thousand tons,  (including 36 thousand tons of wheat, 18 thousand tons of sugar and 6 thousand tons of oilseeds)appreciably lower than in August (90 thousand tons) and July (133 thousand tons).September sinkings were nearly offset by the arrival of 70 thousand tons ofdiverted cargoes; the latter, which averaged nearly 230 thousand tons per month from May to August, are likely to be negligible in future.Apart from the loss of cargo, the sinking of a homeward bound ship maymean the loss of a ship already allocated to the Ministry of Pood for its nextvoyage.    Thus the sinking in September of four cargoes of Canadian wheattotalling 28 thousand tons entailed a loss of the same weight of cereal tonnagenominated for November loading in Canada.     The loss, in August-September, ofrefrigerated ships with a capacity of 20 thousand tons cannot be replaced andemphasises the shortage of refrigerated capacity.Increased voyage times also adversely affect arrivals.    Compared withMay (given in brackets) the average lengths of tramp voyages in September were from India 73 days  (45), from Egypt 86 days (26), from North America 26 days (24),from South America 54 days (44), from Australia via the Cape 77 days (59), from australia via Panama 67 days (49).Increased turn-around times caused by congestion at ports by the diversion of ships from East to Y/est coast ports, by lack of storage space atsome ports and by time lost and other disturbances due to air raids, is anotherfactor which, by delaying the outward departure of ships allocated to the Ministryof Pood, tends to postpone loading dates and decrease subsequent arrivals.Increased freight rates for liners came into operation on October 1st,whilst further increases in both tramp and liner   rates take effect on November7th.     The estimated costs of these increases (excluding  Ivy million increasedwar risk insurance) is  22-g- millions per annum,22.    INLAND TRANSPORTPort facilities     Air raids, the diversion of the larger ocean going vessels to west coast ports, labour shortage and railway delays are all tending to cause congestion at the ports now in use and to decrease the rate of discharge.Dockers are, however, working 7 days a week (through air-raids if necessary)and the weighing of cargoes has been abolished in an effort to reduce turn-aroundtimes  (see para.  21 Shipping). &apos;
1 o% 0Rail and Road transport is, on the whole3 -working smoothly hut, largely due to the detention of wagons in marshalling yards as a result of air raids,there is a shortage of wagons and wagon sheets which adds to the difficulties ofvail transport. Road transport is, however, being used to clear ships and portsthus help to reduce port and rail congestion,,     Further, increased use ofr^a.qtvdse shipping is relieving the load on the railway system and, if further developed, will help to relieve both road and rail congestion and save petrol,The cold storage situation is difficult0    At the end of September,following the loss of over 2 million cubic feet during August and September, theU-Ke capacity (of which half was in London) amounted to little more than34 million cubic feet, which in terms of commodities nay be put at 150,000 tonsneat, 30,000 tons bacon,, 40,000 tons butter, 6,000 tens fish, 15,000 tons eggs and 8,000 tons other food,     A further half a million cubic feet has been putout of action since the end of September and although 5 million cubic feet are under construction in less vulnerable areas and a further 5 million cubic feet of new construction have been authorised, unless the London stores can continueto receive produce the immediate position will be serious.23.   DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION DUE TO AIR ATTACKSince the 7/9th September, when heavy losses were suffered in the london dock area, the most serious damage occurred during the week ended 29th September,when stocks totalling about 20,000 tons were destroyed in Liverpool.      otherwise the weekly rate of loss has been small.As accurate and timely accounts of the extent of damage cannot beobtained, losses are classified in three categories, viz., where early reportscannot be verified quickly, the reported losses are entered into a &quot;Doubtful&quot;category; when it is possible to obtain a closer estimate of losses, entriesare made or transferred to an &quot;Estimated losses&quot; category? when full information is available the estimated losses ace corrected and included in a &quot;confirmedlosses&quot; category.The losses confirmed to dace total 116,000 tons,  of which 84,000 tons were in Londons   In addition, estimated losses totalled 45.000 tons (31,000 tonsin London), while losses included in the doubtful category totalled nearly20,000 tons (17,700 tons in London),      Details of the losses of individual commodities are included in Appendix Table IV.Although considerable damage has been dene to mills, food factories,cold stores, warehouses and distributors&apos; premises, this has, so far, not been sufficient to cause more than a temporary disturbance to the processing anddistribution of food supplies.    Five per cent of the flour milling capacityof the U.K, has been destroyed, but the unused output capacity in other millshas been more than, sufficient to make good this loss,    3-g$ of the oilseedcrushing capacity has been destroyed, but the capacity of the remaining mills is sufficient to meet requirements.    In many instances Mutual Assistance pactshave operated to relieve the position - particularly in the bakery trade, whilethe &quot;Grouping system&quot; operated by the London provision and grocery wholesalershas gone far to ensure continued distribution in spite, of damage to or thedestruction of premises belonging to 77 firms.    Specific air raid damage problems affecting individual commodities have been dealt with in earlier paragraphs of this report0Since 8th September; 2 Divisional and 14 Local Food Offices (elevenof the latter in London) have been damaged by enemy action but, with the aid,when necessary, of duplicates of essential records and new accommodation, thework has been rapidly re-established without serious dislocation.Damaged retail shops have mostly been rapidly re-established and the mutual Assistance pacts are working efficiently.     Transport difficulties have, in some cases, delayed arrival of supplies at retailers&apos; premises.
A series of discussions has been held with the Hon. J. G. Gardiner,Canadian Minister of Agriculture, and Canadian Officials, about the proposedimports of foodstuffs from Canada during the second year of war.     The Ministry&apos;imports from Canada are severely limited by exchange difficulties.    But byprice concessions from Canada and by an exchange of views on the commodities which matter most both to Canada and the United Kingdom it is hoped to widen the programme and to make the reductions less burdensome to both countries.25.    SPAINThe channels of negotiation for the purchase of Spanish fruits and vegetables have proved very unsatisfactory in recent months, and in order toavoid further delays and to achieve the maximum political value from futurepurchases, the Ministry is arranging for a representative to leave for Madridat an early date.     He will keep in touch with the United Kingdom CommercialCorporation, which is conducting trade negotiations in Spain.26.    POLITICAL PURCHASES IN THE ALLIED COLONIAL EMPIRESThe Ministry has completed the purchase of palm kernels, groundnuts,cocoa and coffee in the French Cameroons and Equatorial Africa: 6,000 tons ofpalm kernels, 7,000 tons of groundnuts and 4,500 tons of cocoa will be shippedto this country at an early date,     The remainder of the cocoa (about 7,500 tons)and 2,500 tons of coffee will be destroyed.Similar purchases in the Belgian Congo are under discussion: these will include palm oil, and possibly sugar and maize, for shipment and palmkernels and coffee probably -for destruction.Negotiations are in progress for the purchase in the netherlands east Indies of further quantities of tea and sugar and small quantities of rice,27.    THE CONSUMERRetail Food PricesRetail Food Price Index (July 1914 i 100)(Ministry of Labour)1959     19401st August 137       1641st September 138       1661st October 150       169The Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of retail food prices rose by 3 pointsduring September, and at 1st October was 22 per cent higher than at 1st September,1939.     This increase was mainly due to a seasonal rise in egg prices; therewere also seasonal increases in the prices of milk in certain districts, andslight rises in the average prices of fish.During October the maximum retail prices of home-produced eggs havebeen further raised by -gd. each, but the index of retail food prices is not expected to reflect the full advance since substantially larger supplies of imported eggs will be available at prices lower than those of home-xoroduced.Some further slight rise in the index is, however,. possible.The average increase since 1st September 1939 in the retail prices of21 foods not included in the cost of living.index amounted, at 31st August, to39 per cent, compared with the increase of 20 per cent at that date in the foodindex.      The estimated increase in the cost of the B.M. A, minimum diet for anadult male from the outbreak of war to September 1940 was 26 per cent (or 25per cent excluding fruit and vegetables).Orders controlling the retail prices of jam, canned &quot;beef and pulsescame into operation during September.
The results of the enquiry into the dietary of the 2,000 householdsare not yet available, but other enquiries on the influence on health of war-timediets have not, as. yet, yielded any concrete evidence of deterioration.   Thereare unconfirmed reports of an increased tendency amongst children to mildrickets.    The advisability of counteracting any such trend by the manufactureof two officially approved substitutes for cod liver oil and halibut liver oilhas been considered.    The addition of Vitamin D to the dried milk issued toinfants under the National Milk Scheme is now under consideration.In addition, scientific problems, arising out of the intention tofortify white bread with Vitamin Bi and calcium salts, are under investigation by the Medical Research Council; the control testing of the Vitamin A and Dcontent of margarine has been instituted; the practicability of producing cheapdried vegetables, which contain all or a large part of their original vitamincontent, is being re-examined.The Ministry&apos;s Scientific Adviser is also co-operating with the InvalidDiets Committee of the Medical Research Council, which consider what extra rations,if any, should be granted to persons with particular diseases, and with theService authorities on the adequacy of the Vitamin Bi  and C contents of theService rations.Deterioration of stocks from enemy action and other causesThe Ministry&apos;s Scientific Adviser and his staff have investigatedji) the condition of the Ministry&apos;s reserve and buffer stocks with a view tominimising losses from infestation pests and other causes and (ii) the conditionof imported&quot; and home killed meat in transit and storage, and made recommendations to reduce the risk of loss from &quot;slime&quot; and other sources of wastage.    enquiries into the contamination of food by powdered and fragmented glass as a resultof air raids have led to the conclusion that even though small fragments of glassdo get into food, there is little danger to health; and a circular dealing withthis point and with methods of protecting food against glass contamination and damage is being issued to Local Authorities.    It is hoped to supplement recentlectures on the contamination of food by war gases &quot;by short courses to those whowould be most concerned with this problem.RationingThe commodities now (23rd October) rationed to individuals are;Per head per weekMeat 2s.2d. worth (say if to 2 lbs.)     (a)Bacon and ham 4- ozs.Butter and/or margarine 6 ozs. (b)Sugar 8 ozs.Cooking fats (or margarine in lieu) 2 ozs.Tea 2 ozs.(a^ Is.Id, worth to children under 6 years(b) of which at.present not more than 2 ozs. can betaken as butter.These, and other commodities as well, are also rationed to manufacturers andcaterers (except in the case of tea).Contact between Headquarters and Divisional Offices has been maintained^ad the powers already delegated to Divisional Pood Officers have proved adequate.Local Pood Control Committees have been requested to report theirrefusals to prosecute to the Divisional Pood Officer, who is authorised to prosecute where he considers that such a course is justified.    This should ensure more efficient enforcement of all the Ministry&apos;s Orders.
With the object of meeting the needs of industrial workers, who areunable to obtain meals through works canteens, their wives and families, thosewhom the war has hit hard, and those on the poverty line,   Local Authoritiesare being urged by the Ministry of Food to set up communal feeding centresat which food is sold at a charge to cover cost of food and running expenses.In London more than 60 L.C.C. centres are now in operation.    In Liverpool,Glasgow, Edinburgh, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham and Newcastle-on-Tyne Local Authorities have agreed to co-operate.    The extension of works&apos;canteen facilities and the improvement of the palatability and nutritive value ofworks1 canteen meals are also receiving attention.Except in the more expensive establishments of Central London there is,since the start of the severe blitzkrieg, a tendency for increased feeding atcatering establishments but, with the exception of ham (gammon) for sale, cookedor in sandwiches, it has been possible to meet the increased demands of catering establishments for rationed and other foods.Emergency FeedingWith the exception of persons in Emergency Rest Centres, the Ministryof Food is responsible for organising emergency feeding through Local Authorities,Caterers, Voluntary Societies, etc.     The L.C.C.&apos;s Communal Feeding Centres(at which typical prices are, soup 2d.,  joint and 2 vegetables 6d. and pudding2d,) are mainly used in gasless areas and move as often as necessary.   Followingexperiments on the best way of providing food and refreshment for those who nightlyinhabit public shelters, a campaign has been started for the establishment ofsuitable facilities through Local Authorities, who will act through caterersor voluntary societies.The demand from A.R.P. workers and others for &apos;ready to eat&apos; foods suchas biscuits and slab chocolate has led to shortages in some areas,     Aspecification for a civilian &quot;iron ration&quot;chocolate has been drawn, butmanufacture has been held up by shortage of skimmed milk powder.   experiments in the use of soya bean meals and ground nut meal as milk powder substitutesare now in progress.Food Education CampaignReports indicate that in the past this Campaign has had in the maina middle class appeal and possible methods of reaching the lower income grades,who most need help, are being investigated.    Towards this end, the co-operationof Maternity and Child Welfare Authorities has already been invited and approach is also being made to the workers through Industrial Canteens.Public relations the Ministry1 s Food Facts1 Series of advertisements in the national press has continued and appears to have been successful.     In addition to stressingthe need for economy in the kitchen and on the table and emphasising the needfor a balanced diet, this Series attempts to encourage the consumption of foods inadequate supply and discourage the use of those in short supply.     Latterly,attempts have been made to combat the effects of the aerial blitzkrieg by(i) publishing recipes for use when gas is short, (ii) giving lists of suitablefoods to take to shelters,  (iii) giving advice on the use of hot drinks intreating shock and (iv) explaining methods of preserving food from contaminationby dust and glass due to bomb blast.
TNDEX OF&apos; STOCKS OF FOODSIn order to provide a single comprehensive measurement of the move-ment of stocks of human foodstuffs shown in the tables in the appendix,they have been expressed as an index by dividing the equivalent calorievalue of the stocks at the end of the month by the weekly consumption inthe following month,  (also in terms of calories).     The index, therefore,indicates the number of weeks 1 supply.     The changes in total stocks onthis basis since the outbreak of war are;No. of weeks supply.End Aug. 1939 H 9&quot;   Sep.      &quot; 13.7;; oct.  - 12.0Nov.      &quot; U.0&quot;   Dec.      &quot; 11 g;; J^. 1940 12;2&quot;                &quot; 12.0&quot;   March   &quot; H 3&quot;   April   &quot; 11.&apos;0&quot;   May      &quot; 12.4&quot;   June     ^ 12.2&quot;   July    &apos; 10.7sep* ,      . 22.0&quot;    Dec.  (forecast)Particulars of stocks of some minor foodstuffs were not availablein the early months of the war and are not included in the indices for thosemonths.In the earlier months of the war, the index shows very littlevariation.    This steadiness, however, obscures relatively markedfluctuations in the stocks of individual commodities.     The decline in Julywas due mainly to the low level of imports during that month.     At the endof August the home wheat crop, and at the end of September, the potato crop,came into the index.     The forecast for the end of December includes thegreater part of the sugar from the 1941 home crop.

Consumption of Fertilisers and Lime.It is now possible to compare the quantities of the principal kinds of fertilisers used in the first year of war with the corresponding figuresfor 1938/39.     The quantity of sulphate of ammonia used increased by31 per cent,, of nitro-chalk by 26 per cent., of basic slag by 22 per cent,and of superphosphate by 11 per cent.     Potash, which is normally obtainedfrom Prance, was in short supply and the quantity used declined by 6 per cent.19 per cent, less lime was usedDMachinery and Implements.The number of tractors available for field work in the United Kingdomlast June was roughly 44 per cento greater than a year earlier.   The FordCompany delivered over 16,000 agricultural tractors to the domestic market in 1939/40 compared with 6,600 in 1938/39.     The current demand for machinery and implements for the 1940/41 season is heavy, and there is some delay in meeting orders, though the requirements of County Committees have been met.The Ministry of Agriculture is pressing for an adequate allocation of steel and alloy steel for home manufacturers.Labour Supply.Generally the corn harvest was gathered without any particular labour difficulties being reported, and except in some localities it is expectedthat there will be adequate labour for potato and sugar beet lifting.    Thereare now about 10,000 members of the Women1 s Land Army in regular employment inGreat Britain, but the demand for further engagements is slow.    In manydistricts school holidays have been given for potato lifting.Arrangements have been made to impress on farmers the importance of affording continuity of employment during the winter, so as to avoid a loss oflabour to other industries.   With the same object in view, War AgriculturalExecutive Committees have been authorised to form gangs to do maintenance work for farmers.Livestook and Feeding-stuffs.Owing to drought and to producers&apos; reactions to the fat stock pricesannounced on August 31st, there have been heavy marketings of cattle, sheep and pigss which have reached levels well above normal even for the presentseason of the year0     It has been necessary to refuse to accept for slaughtera proportion of the livestock offered, in particular ^hose capable ofimprovement or suitable for breeding.     There are indications that the numbersof cattle sent forward are falling off, but the numbers of sheep offered forslaughter still remain high.The pig population in Northern Ireland has decreased more than inGreat Britain, and the Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland anticipate that after the end of the year there will be no surplus of bacon for export toGreat Britain.The Ministry of Food are making arrangements to supply substitutefeeding-stuffs in districts affected by the reduction in supply of distilleryty-produets.Animal Health.Since the last Report there have been some outbreaks of foot andaouth disease in the West Riding, Breconshire and Radnorshire.     A highincidence of swine fever persists.
By the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in conjunctionwith the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretaryof State for the Home Department.15th October, 1940.Crop Conditions, etc.In England and Wales, rain in the latter half of September cametoo late to allow much improvement of pastures up to the beginning of October;and, similarly, the fodder root and sugair beet crops have suffered from lackof rain.     Weather conditions were, however, favourable for completing the harvest and commencing autumn cultivations.     Potato crops are healthy andlifting is now general throughout England.     Owing to drought the increasedmarketings of livestock have been in rather lean condition, and milk yieldshave continued to be below the seasonal normal.In Scotland and Northern Ireland reports on crop conditions are similarexcept that on the whole the pastures have afforded more keep than in England,but on the other hand potato results may not be so good.In Scotland grazing cattle have generally made fair progress, butthe yield of milk has fallen considerably in the south-west owing to drought.Some lowland sheep have also suffered but hill sheep are thriving reasonably wellIn Northern Ireland the Ministry of Agriculture has purchased theentire surplus of this year1 s Canadian flax seed crop - a quantity almostsufficient to sow an acreage equal to this year1 s.     Together with home savedseed, the total quantity should allow for a material expansion of acreagenext year.Prom later information It appears that the United Kingdom cropforecasts given in last month1 s Report under-estimated the yields from wheat,potatoes and peas, and over-estimated those from mangolds and sugar beet.The differences amount, however, to only a few per cent.Milk Production and Consumption in the United Kingdom(millipngallons).Liquid Manufacturing TotalSeptember, 1938 71.0 33.5 104.5September, 1939 67.1 46.7 113.8August, 1940 76,5 36.3 112.8September, 1940 76,9 21.1 98.0Stabilisation of Feeding-stuffs and Fertiliser pricesArrangements have now been made in consultation with the otherDepartments concerned to stabilise at their present level the prices of fertilisers and of animal feeding-stuffs up to June and September, 1941,respectively.     Since there is a prospect of considerable stability in wage rates and rents, the new arrangements regarding fertilisers and feeding-stuffsshould go far to give farmers greater certainty as to future costs in respectof the most important items of expenditure.     The need for frequent changesin agricultural prices to make allowance for increases in costs will be avoided, and the conditions now created will enable farmers to plan ahead with security.
