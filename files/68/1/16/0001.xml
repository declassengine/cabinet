It is circulated to the War Cabinetin accordance with the Conclusion reached at its meeting on the 7th September.      (W.M,   (39) Conclusion,Minute lk).      Subsequent reports will he circulated atmonthly intervals.It is desired to draw attention to theparticular secrecy of certain of the information givenin the report.(Sgd.)    KING-SLEY WOOD.Richmond Terrace,  S.W.1.23rd September.  1939.

ON SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION.1.The accompanying memorandum dated July1939s &quot;by the Air Member for Development and Production,was prepared for the information of the PrimeMinister&apos;s Panel of Industrial Advisers.      It describesin general terms the supply problems of the Air ministry and the progress achieved with the Expansion Programmeup to the end of June 1939,  and is circulated to ministers in order to give them the general background of the subject.      The present report brings thememorandum up to date so as to indicate broadly theposition with regard to the supply of all the moreimportant items of equipment of the Royal Air force at the 10th September 1939, and also outlines thegeneral measures taken to intensify production and tosafeguard supplies on the outbreak of war.2. On August 26th a letter was sent to allairframe and engine contractors and also producers ofraw material and the main items of equipment,instructing them to increase production by theemployment of extra shifts and overtime,  and at thesame time more detailed instructions were given to individual firms with regard to concentration uponwork for the Royal Air Force and the priority of thevarious pieces of work on which they were engaged.It is still too early to assess the full effect ofthese measures./3.On the....

2  -10?3.      On the outbreak of war a number of measures already planned to safeguard supplies were brought intooperation.      In particular,  steps were taken to remove the prototypes of new types of aircraft from vunerable areas - the Stirling being moved from Rochester toGloucester, and the Halifax from Cricklewood to Bicester.Also the Halifax jigs and tools and certain ^key1&apos; menwere moved to the English Electric Company&apos;s works atPreston.      In order to safeguard the supply of completedHudson aircraft, 10 were flown from the United states to Canada before September 11th when the Neutrality Actwas applied to the Dominion.MaterialsU.      An adequate supply of materials,  in particular of aluminium alloy in the form of sheet, strip andextrusions, is essential for the manufacture of aircraft.The requirement of light alloys for civil purposes is small and it has been necessary therefore to expandgreatly the output for the purposes of the Royal AirForce re-armament productions.      itoreover these requirements will steadily increase as newer and heaviertypes of aircraft come into production while it must berealised that following any decision to increase theRoyal Air Force aircraft output programme,  there is alag in the provision of the necessary material owingto the time taken to erect the necessary rolling millsetc.This subject was referred to in detail on pages k - 6 of the memorandum referred to above and an indication of the growth of the output of light alloyswas given in Appendix II.      The projects for increasingthe production of light alloys in this country, whichwere described in the memorandum, are being implementedand increased to the greatest possible extent./Thus

Thus, the factory managed &quot;by the Northern AluminiumCompany in South Wales is being expanded to produce thefull 15,000 tons of sheet and strip a year for whichit has been planned and the LCI.   factory in SouthWales is being expanded to produce 8,000 tons a year with the use of certain steel rolling plant.      Alarge new factory under the management of High DutyAlloys Ltd.  is being established in Scotland for theproduction of light alloy forgings and extrusions.Requirements and potential output of lightalloy are kept constantly under review in order todetermine whether the creation of additional output capacity is required.      It now appears probable thatlarger supplies from Canada will be necessary.As capacity for supply of steel stampingswas concentrated in Sheffield arrangements have b^enmade for the creation of such capacity also inManchester and Glasgow.      The supply of steel has been carefully watched and all producers of material (mainlytubes, bearings,  etc.) for the Royal Air Force, who require Swedish iron and steel, have been instructed to accumulate on behalf of the Department a stockequivalent to 6 months1  requirements.      The capacityof the Scottish Stamping and Engineering Company forthe production of crankshafts is being approximatelydoubled.Airframe production.5. The actual deliveries of airframes, togetherwith, the planned output for the months July and august and the first ten days of September were as follows/July

DeliveriesPlanned output.July758734August629668September 1-10230229The planned output figures given above have,of course, now been superseded by a war programme,and it is anticipated that they will shortly rise to1,000 a month and to 2,000 a month within 18 months inso far as production is concentrated on types of aircraft at present in production.      As new and larger types begin to come into production during the second war year therewill be a further increase in terms of horse-power andload carrying capacity but a reduction in the total numbersof aircraft delivered monthly.In addition to production on this scale athome, it is hoped that production in Canada for theRoyal Air Force will in two years provide 200 aircraft of training types a month and 40 large bombers a month,while Australia may be able in a similar period tosupply 25 General Reconnaissance aircraft a month.Special mention should be made of the problems involved in the supply of aircraft for Army Co-operationwork and for the equipment of the Fleet Air Arm.      TheArmy programme notified in recent weeks calls for thesupply of 100 Lysander aircraft a month early next year as compared with the maximum output so far achieved of33 a month.      This type is being made by a firm whohave hitherto been planning to turn over their fullproductive capacity to the production of cannon gunfighters for the Royal Air Force by December 1940.      An55 Includes holiday period,,/attempt

attempt is being made to meet the Army requirementfully by allowing this firm to continue in production on Lysander aircraft, by a large amount of sub-contracting to a new firm, and by seeking to obtain a supply from Canada.      In so far as Army requirementscannot be fully met in Lysanders, Anson or Oxfordaircraft will he supplied until productive capacityhas been built up.The Fleet Air Arm programme calls for theproduction of 20 Walrus (Amphibian) aircraft a monthas soon as possible, and 90 Albacore (Torpedo SpotterReconnaissance) aircraft a month in 12 or 15 months&apos;time.      The present rate of delivery of Walrusaircraft is only 3 a month and the Albacore is notyet fully in production, but urgent steps have beentaken to accelerate it and also to provide a secondsource of supply of each type.      A total productionof 12 Walrus aircraft a month will be achieved in9 months&apos;  time and it is hoped that, by the expansionof production capacity, this output will be raised to 20 a month, if required, in about 16 months&apos;  time.With regard to Albacore aircraft,  it will not bepossible to provide the full requirement without thecreation of new capacity and this matter is beingurgently investigated.      The Air Ministry is in close touch with the Admiralty on the question.Repair of Airframes.6.      Arrangements are being made with Lord Nuffieldfor the repair of fighter aircraft in the motor bodyshops of Morris Motors./Engines

7.      The memorandum for the Prime Minister&apos;sPanel of Industrial Advisers describes the shortageof aero-engines as compared with the airframeprogramme, and the steps taken to increase production.The new Rolls-Royce factory at Glasgow is being pressed on with all possible speed as are the four newShadow factories for the production of Bristol engineswhich are now being constructed ab initio for their maximum production of kOO engines a month single shift,under the management of motor car firms.      In orderfurther to ameliorate the position with regard toRolls-Royce and Bristol engines it has been decidedto concentrate on a few types of each to the exclusion of types for which requirements are comparatively small.It has further been decided to create a nuwShadow factory for the production of about kOO Bristolengines a month under the management of the BristolCompany, and a new factory with a capacity of 2,000Napier engines a year,  to be managed by D.  Napier &amp;Sons, while second sources of supply of ArmstrongSiddeley and De Havilland engines are being established,to be managed by the Rover and Standard Motor CarCompanies respectively.      Arrangements are being madefor the manufacture    of Rolls-Royce engines in the motor car works of the Austin Company.Repair of Engines.8.      Arrangements are being made with the RoverMotor Car Company for the repair of Cheetah engines, andwith Messrs.  Rootes for the repair of Rolls-Royce Merlin/ and

and Bristol engines..E quipment.9... Anxiety has recently heen caused by a shortageof items of equipment such as wireless and navigationalinstruments.     The cause has been mainly, not a fallingshort of the programme by the manufacturers of theseinstruments, hut the acceleration of the airframe output,together with a certain amount of disorganisation causedby the necessary dispersal of air Ministry stores fromKidbrooke.      Bulk orders for those instruments andother equipment which are common to a number of types of aircraft are now being placed.      Concurrentlyproduction is being increased with the help of these orders by the introduction of new firms and by usingadditional capacity of large firms now available ondiminution of their civil business.      Steps are beingtaken to make the best economic use of the aggregateresources available.      The matter is being kept undercareful review and progress will be reported from timeto time.Armament (turrets, bombs, machine guns and ammunition).10, The capacity required for meeting demands forthese items is constantly under review.     New capacityhas been and is being created as necessary to meetchanging demands and reports will be made as to thesituation from time to time.Balloon Barrage.11, A review has recently been undertaken of the BalloonBarrage position in the light of a fresh estimate of wastageunder war conditions. The programme hitherto laid down for the/Balloon

Balloon Barrage will be achieved with no more than one month&apos;s delay, but wastage is now expected to be-considerably higher than was anticipated and steps aretherefore being taken to double the present output capacity for balloons as soon as possible.      all available supplies of Sea Island cotton (the mostsuitable type of cotton for balloon fabric) are being obtained, but the supply of this cotton is likely to fall far short of requirements and very little more willbe obtainable until the next crop is gathered.      In thecircumstances, a type of fine Egyptian cotton will beused for immediate requirements and to meet the excessof requirements over the supply of Sea Island cotton, anda supply of Egyptian cotton is being ordered by theMinistry of Supply.      Capacity for production of gas and ancillary equipment  (eg.  tractors, winches, hydrogencylinders) is kept constantly under review.New types of aircraft.12.      Reference was made in the memorandum for thePrime Minister&apos;s Industrial Panel to the difficulties experienced in the development of new types for introduction into the Service.      These difficulties are increased by the fact that these new types require a larger amount of material and a greater number of man-hours for their construction.      Adequate floor spaceexists for the present programme, however, and theproduction of these types is being pressed on with allpossible speed.      At the same time the production on alarge scale of a bomber constructed of wood and steeltubing instead of light alloys is being organised;the performance of this aircraft is satisfactory and/its

its construction taps new sources of raw materials and labour.      Large&apos;orders have also been givenrecently for the production on a large scale of a new type of fighter which has a better performance than anytype at present in the Service and will be capable of mounting cannon guns.Works Programme,13.      It is too early to indicate the effect ofthe outbreak of war on the building programme of theRoyal Air Force, but the situation should be clearerby the date of the next report.      considerable difficulties have arisen in connection with theprovision of steel, labour and materials and inconsequence of the impressment of contractors&apos; vehicles,but it is hoped that action that has been taken withother Departments may satisfactorily overcome these difficulties.

(R) (39)Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.!3rd September, 1939.

secret memorandum by the Air Member for development and Production.In the previous report submitted on 13,1.39. a detailed explanation was given of the problem which confrontedthe Air Ministry in securing rapid production of airframes,aero-engines, airscrews and aircraft equipment to meet the approved programme of expansion.     The technical and productionproblems which had to be solved were described and thefinancial arrangements governing the expansion of the industryto meet our requirements were briefly stated.     Members ofthe Panel will recollect that some 12,000 aircraft arerequired during the two financial ijars 1938 and 1939,  andthe main effort over the preceding lew months had been directed to ensuring that this number would be obtained, with,it was stated, every hope of success.,Appendix I to the previous report showed the monthly rate of deliveries of aircraft during 1936, 193? and1938,  together with the anticipate; monthly deliveries for1939,      The following are the actual deliveries and plannedoutput of aircraft for 1939:Deliveries       planned OutputJanuary - 449 426February - 587 457March - 740 5 24April - 670 575May &apos;- 747 633June - 740 685These figures reflect a satisfactory situation and it will be noticed that, during the first six mbnthd, actual deliveriesexceeded planned output, the slight drop In output in June

1 4 1being due to the effect of Whitsun holidays, as the drop in output in April reflected the Easter holiday period.The output figures for the first six months of 1939tend to reinforce the view that the programme of 12,000aircraft by 1st April 1940 will at least he achieved, and withthe assurance that this goal will be reached  consideration is now being given to the future policy under which the productive capacity built up for this purpose is to be worked 0A chart showing past and anticipated futuredeliveries ie attached as Appendix 1.Engines.ft was not until the end of last year that a plannedairframe output programme was available and, in the absenceof this programme,  the adequacy of estimated engine outt;Ul.wae perforce somewhat conjectural,     Up to that time it wan;thought that engine production would cause us no anxietysince the new Air Ministry factory at Crewe would, with the rolls Royce Company&apos;s own works, provide all the Rolls royce engines necessary, while the increased numbers of Bristolengines required in war could be obtained by turning over the parent motor car firms to aero-engine manufacture when war broke out.     When an attempt was made to formulate in detaila plan for using the motor car firms in this way it became apparent that only a small percentage of their existing plant was suitable for aerc-engine manufacture, and consequently alarge capital expenditure on suitable plant would he necessary,Further,  it was clear that a considerable time would elapse afie;the outbreak of war before the unsuitable plant could bereplaced and production of aero-engines could be organised and

14 9i 03.got under way in the factories.     This delay could not be faced and it became apparent that a recasting of our plans for aero-engine production in war was necessary.     Ourconclusion in this respect was reinforced by the fact thatan accurate review of the aero-engine production position inthe light of the statement of planned airframe output made it clear that additional capacity would have to be obtained for aero-engine production in peace.     This was In part dueto the fact that tfhere had been a great increase in airframecat put due to the energetic efforts of all concerned.The steps which we have taken to increase aero-engine production capacity are as follows.     Pour new Shadowfactories are being built for the production of Bristol typeengines, organised in two groups of two factories, eachproducing complete engines;    they will contribute towards theaacessary peace expansion and will also be capable of muchmore rapid expansion in war than would be possible by using the motor car firms,,     1t is hoped that these factories will begin production in the Spring of 1940.     An additionalfactory for aero-engine production by the Bristol Company maybe necessary in the autumn.So far as Rolls-Royce types are concerned, it hasbeen necessary almost to double the capacity of the firm(including the Government factory managed by them)    and thisis Deing done by means of a new factory near Glasgow.     Thepre/ious expansion of the Rolls-Royce Company at Crewe wasmade with great expedition - authority to proceed was given on -and June 1938, building was commenced on 4th July and production etarted on 5th November 1938.     Steps are also being taken to bring the Glasgow factory into operation inrecord time;   machine tools were ordered at the earliest

possible moment, possession of the land was taken andexcavation started by agreement before formal transfer, andtechnical colleges are being kept open during the summer inorder to train employees for the new factory.      Ft is hopedthat the factory will commence production in 12 months andbegin to deliver   complete engines in 18 monthsoThe labour of the motor car industry will, of course,be indispensable to the expansion of the aero-engine industryimmediately on the outbreak of war and its floor apace willbe used in war as quickly as possible,      In this connection,plans are now being made for production in war of Polla-Poyeeengines in the Austin and Humber works and rlana will be worked out for the repair of Rolls-Royce and Bristol engines and the creation of another source of supply of an ArmstrongSiddeley type to be distributed between the Rover, tfootesand Standara factories.Our existing aero-engine production capacity willprovide sufficient engines for the 12,000 aircraft we are dueto produce by 1st April 1940 but, unless there is to be a slowing down of aircraft production after that Jate,   therewill be a temporary shortage of aero-engines which v/ill notbe overtaken until the new capacity which is being providedhas attained its full rate of production.Materials.The fact that airframe output has exceeded the planned rate has meant a demand for earlier material.Moreay^**-, the increase in the number of sub-contractors whoare taking part in aircraft manufacture has resulted in e. tyingup cf a substantial amount of material in transit eM at sub-contract or a&apos; works.     An organisation has been evolved which,

. i id 0in conjunction with the manufacturers themselves, securesthe most effective distribution of the available material to meet requirements in accordance with the desirablepriorities but, even so, the material position is nowdifficult.     Further, a considerable increase in presentproductive capacity is necessary in order to provide theoutput which will be required to meet our requirements inwar.By the end of this year the output of light alloysfrom existing sources will have reached a rate of about40,000 tons a year.      It is of Interest that this output willhave been built up from an output of 10,000 tons eighteen months ago and 3,500 tons at the beginning of expansion.A further 40,000 tone a year must be found to meet war requirements;    schemes are in preparation to build up this capacity as follows-. -Tons perannum.1,       Extension of Northern AluminiumCompany&apos;s works at Banbury to produce 5,0002,       Use of a disused steel works atRoger-stone belonging to Guest, Keen&amp; Nettlefold, to be managed bythe Northern Aluminium Company. 15,0003.       New works at Mossend, Motherwell,(the old Beardmore works), to be managed by interests associated with high Duty Alloys Ltd. 7,5004.       A new works in South Wales to be managed by LCI, Ltd. in conjunctionwith an existing steel rolling mill. 8,0005,       A new works in Canada.5,00040,500

The extension of the Northern Aluminium Company&apos;sworks at Banbury will be in operation in six month&apos;a timeand the new works in Canada are well In hand and should bein operation in April 1940.     With regard to the other threeschemes, it is intended to create one third of the totalcapacity now, but with full provision for its extension atlater dates.      Thus, the new factory in South Wales tobe managed by the Northern Aluminium Company is being planned to produce at a rate of 5,000 tons a year in 9 - 12 months&apos;time but is capable of rapid extension to the full plannedcapacity making use inter alia of a certain amount of equipmentbeing used by Messrs. Lysaght for steel rolling.     The factory at Mossend which is proposed to be managed by the High DutyAlloys Group is being planned to produce at a rate of 2,700tons a year in about twelve months&apos;  time.     The 1.0.1. scheme in South Wales is progressing and machinery of long dateddelivery has been ordered.     The total cost of these immediateprojects is estimated at between  2% million and  2^ million.The extensions now being undertaken are for theproduction of sheet,  strip, extrusions and tubes;    castingsand forgings cause no present anxiety, although their supply will have to be expanded eventually, and in. this connectionsome difficulty is anticipated from a shortage of moulders.Steel for Engines.Since a shortage of steel is anticipated towards theend of this year, all engine firms are being instructed to order their steel requirements for the full programme of engines and a substantial margin in addition as a reserve.

It will be appreciated that increased engine production necessitates increased production of airscrews,carburettors, magnetos and other engine accessories.     steps have been taken as indicated below to plan an increased outputof these items to keep them in balance with the increased number of engines being produced.In the following paragraphs these subjects are dealt with and also the increased capacity necessary for theproduction of armament and equipment for the increased airframeoutput and for the war potential which we are aiming at.Airscrews.Airscrew production has been reviewed to ensure itsadequacy for peace requirements and war potential, and it hasbeen decided to extend the Shadow factory at Lostock managed by the De Havilland Company.     Work on this is proceeding andfurther extensions of capacity will receive consideration inthe light of a recalculation of requirements which is in hand.Carburettors.Carburettors for Bristol and Armstrong Siddeley types of engines are obtained from the principal professionalmanufacturers (the Hobson Company), a Shadow factory at oldhammanaged by that firm, and another Shadow factory at Coventrymanaged by the Standard Company.     Carburettors for RollsHoyce and other types of engines are obtained from the S.U.Carburettor Company&quot; (part of the Nuffield Group) who alsouse the Riley Works at Coventry.     Within the last few monthsadditional plant has been provided to increase the outputof the Hobson Company and the Riley Works.Magnetos.Air Ministry supplies are derived from three firms,B.T.H., Rotax and Simms Motor Units, and the capacity of all

1c* 98.these firms is being approximately doubled.     The B.T.H.extension at Coventry is already In hand and will startproduction about March 1940.     This firm will be responsible for more than half the total supplies.     Simma Motor Units, whoare comparatively new to the magneto industry and provideonly a small proportion of requirements, are being assistedto expand their production at Willesden.     In order to spread production as much as possible to give additionalsecurity and to tap new sources of labour, It has beendecided that the new Rotax factory should be provided inSouth Wales in a factory built with the assistance of theCommissioner for the Special Area.,Aircraft instruments and equipment.It will be readily appreciated that production of aircraft instruments and equipment must be so planned as to&apos;ensure that aircraft can be fully equipped as soon as they areproduced, and at the same time war reserves must be accumulatedand production capacity sufficient for war requirementsbuilt up.     When it is remembered that there are about 5,000different items of equipment to be provided and, moreover,that .these items may vary in design according to the aircraft for which they are intended, while the scale of previsionvaries with different wastage rate3, etc,-, the immensity and complexity of the task is -realised.     Calculation of require-menta to keep them in step with the aircraft output programme is now practically complete and, In order to providemachinery for the speedy placing of orders and creation of capacity, an Aircraft Equipment Orders Committee has beenappointed under the chairmanship of the Deputy Director-General of Production.     On this Committee are representedEquipment, Production, Contracts and Finance branches, and

1f* .?b &apos;1Armament.Investigation of our armament requirements has proceeded on the two-fold basis of (a) meeting our peace needs and (b) providing the manufacturing capacity which we willrequire in war.(1)   Turrets.Aircraft turrets are still undergoing rapid develop-ment,.but types for use with machine guns on the principalbomber and fighter aircraft in current production have beenstandardised.     The two principal types are Fraser-Nash turretsdeveloped by the Parnall Aircraft Company and Boulton Paulturrets.     Steps are being taken to expand production capacityaa widely as possible by associating Brockhouse EngineeringLtd. and the Daimler Company with the Parnall Aircraft company for the manufacture of Fraeer-Nash turrets, and by the creationof a joint organisation of the Boulton Paul Company and theLucas Group,     These associations have been arranged at thesuggestion of the Air Ministry which has recently provided the Committee is empowered to determine the orders whichshall be placed to secure output in time for fitting to theaircraft concerned, and the productive sources necessary forour programme in peace and war.     The technical directoratesare also represented on the Committee as necessary, in orderto advise on items of equipment at present in the developmentstage which it may be necessary to order.     This Committeeis proving a satisfactory means of securing rapid decisions and action in a complicated field of detail.

the Brockhouse Company with plant for the manufacture ofPraaer-Nash turrets.(2)   Machine guns and cannon guns.Two types of machine gun are at present in service,each fix*ing ,303&quot; ammunition - the Vickers &quot;K&quot; gun and theBrowning gun.     Certain of the new types of aircraft will be armed with the Hispano Suiza cannon gun firing 20 rain,ammunition,.&quot;K&quot; guns are at present produced only at Crayford,Kent, which is in a vulnerable area and, although there is nodeficiency, the firm are working double shift to achieve theoutput required,,     It is therefore proposed to provide additional capacity for production of &quot;K&quot; gune in the new factory at Openohaw for cannon gun production referred to belowWith regard to Browning guns, the capacity of theB.S.A.  Company itself is being very subatantially increasedwith financial assiatance from the Air Ministry, and theproduction of parta by sub-contractors for assembly by theB,S.A- Company at Redditch has also been arranged.     when these arrangements are complete (early next year) it will bepossible to produce the total peace requirements of Browningguns by single shift working and it is estimated that war requirements could be met by adding extra shifts.Requirements for cannon guns will not arise untilthe latter part of 1940, when there will be available a large volume of skilled labour, floor space and general equipmentno longer required for production of &quot;K&quot; guns which can be turned over to cannon gun production.     In these circumstancesplans for the creation of new capacity have been limited and part of the early requirements will be met by accumulatinga reserve in advance,     The orantham factory of the British

1 *gfdanufacture and Research Company (a subsidiary of theHispano Suiza Company established in this country with the encouragement of the Air Ministry last year) is now beingextended.     Capacity is being created in the Royal small arms Factory, Enfield, for the production of cannon guns,and plans are being made for a new factory at Openshaw to be managed by Vickers.(3)    Bombs, high explosive and incendiary.A recent review of the operational requirements ofthe Royal Air Force has necessitated considerable revision of requirements of high explosive and incendiary bombs, the quantities of some types being markedly reduced and othersconsiderably increased, with a substantial increase in thetotal weight of bombs required for war reserve.     No special difficulty is anticipated in accumulating the increased reserve,except in the case of one type for which, however, additionalproductive capacity is now being arranged.     Subject tocertain adjustments, the war filling organisation already being established will, when completed, be adequate to meet the revised requirements, except in the case of incendiary bombsfor which additional filling capacity is now being created.The manufacturing capacity already available or in contemplationwill, it is estimated, meet the war production requirementson the revised basis.Certain types of bombs have hitherto required fuzes&apos;the supply of which has been, and still is, difficult from thepoint of view of design, manufacture and filling, particularlyin the cases of the anti-submarine bomb and the serai armourpiercing bomb, where the fiifficulty has centred in the design of a watertight fuze.     These difficulties are graduallybeing surmounted;    and a substantial improvement in the general

1 nn* If J &amp;An attempt has been made above to give a generaldescription of the situation with regard to the production of aircraft ana the principal supplies necessary for the equipment of aircraft as fighting machines.     The paragraphswhich follow will deal In the first place with matters, not already covered, on which the Panel have expressly asked forinformation - viz0,  the Fleet Air Arm, the Balloon Barrage,bomb storage, plastics and machine tools;     and in the second place with matters of a general nature concerning productionviz. war potential,  labour, new types of aircraft, delays inarmament design and development, and departmental machinery.Kleet Air Arm aircraft.The particular difficulties in development of fleet air Arm aircraft referred to in the last report have now been largely overcome;    of approximately H60 aircraft delivered to the Fleet Air Arm since that date about a hundred consistof one modern type, and production deliveries of a second typeare commencing.      In addition, a substantial order has beenplaced for a new Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance aircraft andprototypes of other aircraft designed for Fleet Air Armsituation should result from a recent decision to abandonfuzes in the case of new orders for the two bomb typesmentioned above in favour.of pistols and detonators, although there may be difficulty for a time in satisfactory filling ofthe detonators.

As a consequenceof the failure of a cylinder referred to in the previous memorandum a new type of cylinder was introduced and some difficulty was experienced in obtaining the new plant required.This problem has now been solved, but technical difficulties are being experienced in connection with the metallisation ofcylinders to prevent corrosion.      (In the event of an emergency,however,  the cylinders would be put into use withoutmetallisation.)Bomb storage.Bomb storage is required for the approved reserves of (a) filled high explosive bombs,  Cb&quot;) empty high explosive-bombs, and (c) filled incendiary bombs.     The storageavailable against the present approved programme under eachof these (leadings is (a) 80p , (b) 70  and (c) 75%;    but about one-fifth of the available storage under (a) and (c), as wellao the whole of the available storage under (b)  is at presentin temporary accommodation.     Arrangements are in train toprovide the permanent storage accommodation needed to meet thebalance of the approved programme as well as additional requirements.P3at tics.The desirability of making as much use as possible of plastic    materials with the object of reducing consumptionof light alloys has been pointed out to aircraft designers,but the introduction of plastics to aircraft for stressedparts is of necessity proceeding slowly.     Apart from

generally accented usage, as for transparent windows incockpits, small moulded parts such as instrument cases and small fittings (particularly for electrical purposes)development has heen undertaken by several aircraft constructorswho are now .. Pting use of plastic materials for such miscellan-Carbonaceous items as covers for airscrew blades, leading edgecovering of main planes, ailerons and elevators, pilot headfairl-pi, wireless masts, etc.     Further uses are being developed experimentally, e.g. airscrews wholly or partly ofplastics, cowlings, complete moulded seats, spars and tailplanes.     Encouragement has been given to two firms, Aeroplastics Ltd,  (formerly the Deekay Aircraft Corporation) andAero Research Ltd. to produce stressed components of aircraftbut the present stage of development is experimental.      Itcan be said generally that synthetic materials have attractivefeatures for aeroplane structural use, but that the presentstock of knowledge is  too scanty for a reliable forecast of probable developments.Mncj ine tools.The Panel have asked specifically for information onmachine tools, but it is understood that a report on thismatter which concerns all three Services, will be rendered bythe Supply Board.On the last occasion when Sir Wilfrid Freeman andMr. Lemon were interviewed by the Panel,  reference was madeto the shortage of extrusion presses in this country.      Inthe past these presses have been imported, usually fromGermany, but manufacture entirely in this country is now being undertaken, and to encourage this development the Air ministry are arranging to place orders in this country for extrusionpresses, required in connection&apos;with the expansion of lightalloy production referred to above, varying from 2,000 to5,0(0&apos; ton3 in size.

Jn formulating plans for increased capacity, we havehad in mind, not only production of requirements in peace tomeet&apos; oar Expansion Programme, but, also the largely increasedrequirements of our planned output of airframes in war.     the dominant policy which we have adopted in this respect is to plan in peace on the basis of output on single shift (withany necessary overtime for balancing processes) so thattransfer of factories to double shift in war would provide thenecessary output for war purposes.     We have also endeavoured,so far a., practicable,   to provide more than one source ofsupply of all items and, wherever new buildings have had to be erected to nrovide additional capacity, steps have been takento ensure that they have been sited after consultation withthe Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Health in regardto labour disputes  j:.:.; &apos;y.  housing and amenities, ana having regard tostrategic conoiderations.     The policy outlined above appliesgenerally  to ail the additional sources of supply dealt within this remorundum although,  in particular cases,  it is jubjeetto modification;    for instance,  the Holls-Hoyce Glasgow factorywill be working on double shift in peace,  the necessary war potential being secured by the organisation of widespread 3ub-contraoting and by use  in war of certain of the motor carfactories, as already described *Labour.The policy with regard to&apos;recx^uitment of labouroutlined in the last report has been maintained.     Theaverage monthly increase in productive man-power over thelast six months has been at the rate of 7.1?/; and simultaneously with this constant increase of labour in the aircraft industry,intensive measures have been taken to increase the extent to

which other firms are drawn into aircraft manufacture.     Astatement showing the labour force engaged on aircraft work isattached as Appendix VI *     It may interest Members of the panel to know that there has been a steady reduction in thenumber of man hours required for the construction of aircraftir. production.     Typical instances are illustrated inAppendix VII,New types of aircraft.The need for getting new types of aircraft into production at the earliest possible date, in order that weshot Id endeavour to keep ahead of development in othercountries and not have to face an emergency without the bestequipment, was stressed in the former report.     It is essentialthat out&apos; new types of heavy bomber and fighter aircraft shouldir. production as soon as possible but it must be reportedthat progress in this respect has been disappointing even when regard is piid to the difficulties inherent in, and thelengthy process of, development of new types of aircrafto[Tone of our new bombers or fighters has yet passed itspreliminary trials and, of our heavy bombers, only one has,as yeti been in the air.      It will be recalled that anumber of firms are being &quot;grouped&quot; for the production ofeach type and an organisation, which is working well, hasbeen evolved for determining the most suitable arrangementsfor the manufacture of jigs and tools, purchase of materials and the placing of sub-contract orders, all of which are proceeding.Delays In armament design and development.Serious delays in the design and development of essential armament material, in particular machine gun ammunition and certain types of bombs and fuzes, were- mentioned

J- d *Gin the last report and the view was expressed that thesedelays were largely due to the difficulty of adapting thepresent organisation of Inter-Service Organisations, such asWoolwich and Enfield,  to meet the particular requirements of1-e.pid development and expansion which we find necessary forthe Royal Air Force.     It must he put on record that these difficulties still exist.     The matter is one of considerable importance in view of the position which armament design anddevelopment must take in a lighting Service, particularlyIn the Royal Air Force where evolution in armament designvitally affects aircraft design.     At present aircraft designif seriously hampered by delays in armament design.Departmental machinery-The previous report referred to the measures whichhad been taken to speed up departmental action, in particular the appointment of the Air Council Committee on Supply whichhad authorised the placing of large orders for aircraft,engines and equipment, and substantial additions to manufacturing capacity  Ln the form of buildings arid plant.      Since the lateof that report the Committee have turned their attention to the capacity for production of the aero-engines and enginer:ceejsories, armament,  aircraft instruments and equipmentnecessary for balancing the programme.     The Committee havehad before their minds at all times the need for creatingproductive capacity foi* each item adequate for the outputwhich v.e shall require in war.      Meetings are held weekly,and the progress wnieh has been made in the last few months in balancing our production programme and creating war potential is in no small measure due to the work which theMembers of the Committee have done under the Chairmanship ofthe Under Secretary of State, with the invaluable assistance

i O *Jat all meetings of Sir Charles Bruce-Gardner, the Chairman ofthe Society of British Aircraft Constructors.     although their work during recent months has been mainly along the linesdescribed above, they have also kept carefully under review-the need for placing additional orders to prevent any gapsin the production of individual firms.     Such orders have, ofcourse, to be placed well in advance in order that firms maymake arrangements in time for securing necessary materials.For this reason the Committee have had the planned aircraftoutput programme (which is itself constantly under review)continuously in mind and, since the last report, have placedorders for some 2,000 further aircraft.Reference has already been made to the work of theAircraft Equipment Orders Committee.Conclusion.The description above of the present state ofdevelopment and production indicates that the programme of12.,000 aircraft for the two years ending in March 1940 will almost certainly be achieved and might even be exceeded.Moreover, the productive capacity which we have created andour plans for increased potential will provide an increased output in the-event of an emergency arising.     Assuming that war should break out during 1939 it is estimated that ourpotential will enable us to meet war wastage requirements interms of current types of aircraft by the end of the first12 months of war.     Enclosed at Appendix VIII is a chartindicating the planned output of aircraft in war on this basis.An endeavour has been made to give a picture,mainly descriptive, of the progress made by the Department ofDevelopment and production during the last six months towardsthe solution of their problem.     The detailed figures ofmany of the main items concerned are Included in the Appendices

i i) LJcto this paper - it was thought that this lay-out would be themost convenient one for the Members of the Panel.     (in certain cases the charts bring up to date information contained in the appendices to the previous memorandum.)     If the presentposition were to be summarised, it might be said that, whenthe problem was tackled initially, the main and fundamentalaspects confronting the Department were dealt with, viz., theallocation of sufficient aircraft orders to enable the firms to plan their production with confidence for the future, andthe creation of the necessary capacity to enable these orders to he carried out in the time allotted.      Simultaneously, steps were taken to order engines, airscrews, armament and equipment for the new aircraft programme and to create additional capacitywhere necessary.     Recently requirements have been reviewed inrespect of all items in greater detail and in the light of later knowledge of the trend of output.     A calculation hasalso been made of the additional capacity which is necessary under the various headings to give the output which is requiredin war.     Recent activities have been directed to securing thatthis additional capacity is brought into being as soon aspossible so that there will be available, both in peace andwur, balanced capacity for the production of airframes, aero-engines, armament and equipment.      It is realised that theproblem is by no means solved.     Each difficulty overcomediscloses fresh difficulties which have to be faced, and it Isthe intention of the Department to search for such difficulties and overcome them as repidly as possible.     The progress made,and in particular the rate of airframe production achieved,appear to be satisfactory..      It can be said that we have concluded the first essential steps to securing the rate of output which we required and that this has been brought about

Needless to say, Sir Wilfrid Freeman and Mr. Lemonhold themselves at the disposal of the Panel to give such further evidence, orally or in writing, as may be required.without having to produce an excessive number of obsolescentaircraft.
