this document is the property OF his britannic majestvs government    &amp; ii printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1939.SECRET. Copy No.   Zf (jW.P. (R.) (39) 33.WAR CABINET.BURMA.SECOND Periodical Report submitted by the Secretary of State for Burma,covering the Period 12th-30th September, 1939.(Previous Report Paper No. W.P. (R) (39) 6.)1. General.THE Governor, Sir Archibald Cochrane, resumed charge on the17th September on return from his curtailed leave.The country generally remains undisturbed. Though relief is felt that thepossibility of hostilities with Japan is diminished, some apprehension lest japan should still join with Germany is expressed both generally and even by Ministers.The Central Dobama Asi Ayon (the principal Nationalistic organisation)has shown a more moderate attitude and a disposition to hint at readiness toco-operate with Government in return for a pledge of further constitutional advance, particularly in the shape of putting Defence in the charge of a BurmanMinister. The &quot; private armies &quot; which it has been the practice of some leadingpoliticians to endeavour to organise among their followers have been the subjectof some public interest, and claims have been made for their recognition by government. It is hoped that the new opportunities for military service afforded by the new Naval Volunteer Force, an additional Territorial Battalion, and theopening of the Auxiliary Force to Burin an s as well as Europeans will prove an effective counter to these suggestions.Ministers have continued to display a distinctly helpful attitude. On theoutbreak of war the Acting Governor invited their active co-operation, explaining that there was no intention of using the emergency to supersede them in any way or to diminish their authority in the various departments in their charge, in theadministration of which, indeed, in pursuance of war aims their co-operation which the Premier readily promised was earnestly sought. (See also belowunder Defence Measures.)Legislature. The Legislature was prorogued on the 15th September after a rather shorter session than had been expected. The Ministry defeated, but by only a small majority, a &quot; no-confidence &quot; motion resting, as is usual with thesefrequently recurring motions, on personal antipathies rather than issues of policy.Press. The Burmese press has been generally moderate in its comments, andits attitude on the whole satisfactory, though it still tends to harp on the point that Great Britain&apos;s solicitude for the freedom of small countries should be givenpractical application in relation to Burma.2. Defence Measures.(a) Eight enemy aliens suspected of being military agents have been arrested and sent to India to be interned.(b) For the purpose of dealing expeditiously with problems arising from thewar, many of which will affect one or more branches of administration entrusted[20083]

The recommendations of these Boards and of the defence council itself are subject to the approval of the Governor to such extent as maybe necessary and will be given effect by action taken in the appropriate Depart-ment of Government.The three Burman Minister Members are co-operating satisfactorily.3. External Relations.Nothing to report.4. Economic.(a) Internal.The measures mentioned in paragraph 4 (a) of the last report have provedeffective in preventing a. rise in the price of essential commodities.(b) External.Control of the rice trade (the most important of Burma&apos;s industries both in production and in export) is being established under the appropriate Board setup by the Defence Council and representatives of the Governments of India and ceylon have been invited to Burma for discussion of their respective requirements in rice.Z.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,October 2, 1939.
