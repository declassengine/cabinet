2ft1 !&quot;Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1939.SECRET. Copy No.     46W.P. (R.) (39) 32.WAR CABINET.INDIA.SECOND Fortnightly Report submitted by the Secretary of State for India,covering the period 12th to 30th September, 1939.(Previous Report, Paper No. W.P. (R.) (39) 5.)General and Political Situation.THE Cabinet will he aware from my memoranda, dated the 25th and29th September that the hopes expressed in my First Report that unqualifiedco-operation in the conduct of the war would be forthcoming from India haveunfortunately so far proved unduly optimistic. In view of those memoranda,there is little that can be usefully said in this section of the present Reportbeyond reminding the Cabinet that the position at the moment is that the Governor-(ieneral is endeavouring, by personal contact with Mr. Gandhi and other leadersof the Working Committee of the Congress, with Mr. Jinnah as representingthe All-India Moslem League, and with individual representatives of the Princes,to find some means of enabling the Working Committee of the Congress, on theone hand, and the Moslem League, on the other, in spite of the inconsistentdemands of these bodies as the price of their support, to give a lead to their followers which will admit of their co-operation.Treatment of Germans in India..The treatment of enemy aliens in India had to be determined by different considerations from those on which policy was based in this country, whereGeriitfins were in the main permitted to leave the country without restraint upto some days after the declaration of war. Conditions in India naturally made it necessary to take more stringent precautions against the danger of hostileactivities, the risk of which was apparent from information obtained prior tothe outbreak of war regarding the Nazi organisations in India. Moreover, therewas the grave risk, more especially in the light of the experience of the war of 1914-18, of enemy subjects escaping from India on the outbreak of war andsettling in neighbouring countries with a view to making trouble for Indian andBritish interests.Shortly before the outbreak of war steps were already taken to prevent theegress of Germans to neighbouring countries. On the 3rd September an EnemyForeigners Order was issued stopping the departure of male enemy aliens without permission of the Central Government, and directing the restriction of movementof others and the internment of males over 16 years of age, executive orders forarrest of suspects having been given on the previous day. Under these orderssome 850 (understood to be all adult males) out of the 1,500 Germans who werein India on the outbreak of war have been arrested and are being concentrated in a central camp at Ahmednagar. The Government of India found it necessaryto make this initial measure of internment general without at that stage according[20084] b
special treatment to missionaries and others. German and Austrian Jews havebeen treated in the main as enemy subjects pending examination of their records,and the holders of Czecho-Slovakian passports were dealt with according to the merits of individual cases. Families of internees have been provided for. anda committee with powers to order immediate release in approved cases in proceed-ing to the place of internment, though it is not clear that this body is to considercases of persons other than refugees.No full report as to the treatment accorded to Germans in Indian States has yet reached me, but in some cases, at all events, they have been sent to theGovernment of India/s internment camp.It appears that the Government, of India have been successful in preventing the escape of suspects to neighbouring countries and have their alien problemwell under control. I am enquiring from the Foreign Office and Home Officewhether in the interests of neutral opinion or for any other reason it may he desirable to invite the Government of India to consider classifying those atpresent interned with a view to permitting some of them to be repatriated toGermany through this country or otherwise, and the possibility of allowingsome of them, particularly missionaries, to remain at liberty in the country if satisfactory assurances can be obtained.German consuls were at first prevented from leaving India pendingassurances of the release of British consuls from Germany, but steps for theirrepatriation are now being taken.Military A /fairs.Since the last report was written, the balance of the Fxternal Defence troops have left India for Egypt and are due at Suez on the 4th October.Arrangements have been made to despatch certain minor units to Egyptduring October.  Details are given in the Annexure.The Government of India are now making arrangements to form two additional Brigade groups for service overseas. Troops required for these Brigadegroups will simultaneously be replaced by the formation of an equivalent numberof new units.There is no change in the situation as regards the R.A.F. in India.The War Office have asked if India can maintain, in clothing, tentage,saddlery, &amp;c, all troops in Egypt, Singapore, Ceylon and Hong Kong some70,000 men and 15,000 horses.   The Government of India have agreed to do so.Foreign and Frontier Relations.Afghanistan. The Afghan Government have welcomed in principle HisMajesty&apos;s Governments offer of an agreement for mutual assistance. Negotia-tions are continuing.North-West Frontier. As a result of certain disaffected Afghans recentlyescaping to Tirah, Afridi lashkars gathered there with the intention of attackingAfghanistan. There was some evidence of an anti-Government movement atKabul, and Italian and German instigation was also suspected. Fortunatelythe lashkars dispersed owing to action taken by the Afghan authorities and the threat of the Indian authorities to bomb the Afridi sections involved.North-West Frontier Province. There has been some improvement in theBannu district as a result of steps taken, in co-operation with the ProvincialMinistry, to reinforce the Frontier Constabulary and to intern the relations ofraiders, &amp;c. The situation, which still gives cause for some anxiety, is receiving the close attention of the Viceroy.Central Asia. In view of recent developments in Russia&apos;s attitude Iconsulted the Government of India in regard to the need for strengthening ourorganisation for obtaining Intelligence from Central Asia, and they have made certain proposals for doing so, possibly with the personal co-operation of theAfghan Prime Minister.Sinkiang. His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Kashgar returned there onthe 13th September after his conversations with the Chinese Provincialauthorities at TJrumchi.   He received satisfactory assurances of the Provincial
Government&apos;s desire to maintain friendly relations, but it remains to be seenhow far this will result in a practical improvement in the treatment of Britishinterests in Sinkiang.Persian Gulf. Proposals are under negotiation with the Sultan of Muscatfor the conclusion of an arrangement for the period of the war, whereby, in returnfor a subsidy and the gift of certain arms and military stores, he would allowHis Majesty&apos;s Government such facilities as they may require in his territory and territorial waters.Indian States.Since the outbreak of war there has been a noticeable lull in Congressagitation against the administrations of Indian States. Progress has beenreported in the organisation of reserve Police under the control of the Politicalauthorities in various Agencies to assist Rulers in maintaining law and order in emergency. In the meantime the Viceroy has received very numerous offers of services from Rulers, including a number of gifts of money in aid of the prosecution of the war, already amounting to over  150,000. I am in correspondence with the Viceroy as to the use to be made of these donations.The present proposal is that the major part should constitute a fund at his disposal for various beneficial objects connected with the troops engaged. TheViceroy also reports that certain units of Indian States Forces have been detailedfor training or internal security duties with the British forces in India.Economic.The Government of India have introduced measures for controlling theexport of various key commodities with a view to ensuring that supplies do not reach the enemy through neutral countries. These measures are already effective and will be tightened up as further experience is gained. Active steps are also being taken to develop the potentialities of India for the supply of certain manu-factured articles and of a number of raw materials, and the Government of india have created a Department of Supply, which, in addition to serving 1&apos;ndia&apos;internal needs, is also in a position to deal with external requirements.Finance.The rupee exchange has continued to remain steady. The sterling resourcesheld by the Reserve Bank of India are substantial, and have been appreciablyaugmented since the beginning of the war, so that there is no present ground for anxiety as to the Government of India&quot;s ability to meet with ease its currentrequirements for expenditure in the United Kingdom. The Reserve Bank is working in close harmony with the Bank of England in measures designed to conserve supplies of dollar and other foreign exchange.Z.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.October 2, 1939.
