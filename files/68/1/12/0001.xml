MINISTRY OF FOOD,REPORT ON THE FOOD SUPPLY POSITION.Introduction of Food Control;,Some preliminary steps were taken before the outbreak of war to check undue demands on food stocks and rises in their prices.     An Order wasmade on the 31st August to prohibit excessive purchases, a precaution whichit was particularly desirable to take in advance of the movement of population in the evacuation scheme and the consequent possibility of some local dislocation In food supply.     On the 1st September the ProvisionExchanges made arrangements to maintain voluntarily, for the time being, theexisting prices of important provisions.At the outbreak of war, the Ministry began to put into operation the plans previously prepared for bringing food supply and distributionunder control.     The scheme for the control of fish broke down and was withdrawn^      Otherwise the schemes have worked satisfactorily on the whole.It cannot be expected that so radical a transition in organisation, from private trading to control, should take place without some difficulties and inconvenience, and the initial period has been complicated by the dislocation of business, and particularly of transport, which is inevitable at theoutbreak of war.      In addition important oversea supplies were held up ordelayed.     Aggravating these difficulties was the action of many people in purchasing abnormal quantities of important commodities including meat,sugar, butter and tea.Food distribution cannot be fully and satisfactorily controlleduntil the scheme for the rationing of the individual consumer is introduced.That, though the last stage, is essential to proper control.     Theadministrative machinery of Local Food Control Committees has been set up,but the issue of ration books must be delayed until the National RegistrationForms are made available to the local Food Offices.     It is unlikely in theresult that rationing can be put into operation before the 20th October.Meantime,  though the Ministry will endeavour to allocate available suppliesequitably as between one area and another,  they cannot ensure equaldistribution to individual consumers.

0 00 6The Ministry&apos;s first Orders regulating prices v/ere designed tohold prices steady at the outset of war and as near as possible to their pre-war level,,     Higher costs,  such as those for freight and insurance onoversea supplies, have necessarily been reflected in later Orders.     Ingeneral, the rises in the retail prices of foodstuffs have been relatively small-     The maximum prices of a vd.de range of animal feeding-stuffs havebeen fixed approximately at the levels ruling immediately before the war,despite the higher cost of obtaining such supplies,  in order to enablefarmers to   produce and sell livestock products at current prices.The following are examples of current prices:-Bread     ......o, ., Increase for 4 lb.  loaf from 7-gd.-8do due to pre-war causes.    It islikely that the price will be raisedshortly to 8-gd.Meat ..........o o, On the average prices are about thepre-war level, but there arelocal variationsoButter .........y. Now 1/Vd, per lb., representing anincrease of about 2d. per lb.Eggs 0......C....0 Slight rise,      due mainly toseasonal causes,Tea    ............. Prices steady:    but there is a larger proportion of high-grade teas on sale.Sugar ............ Increases of ^d.-^d. per lb.exclusive of the new duty.Milk...........o. Pre-war prices.Stocks of foodstuffs.(a)   Dispersal.The decision to implement the plans for the dispersal of certainstocks from the vicinity of the Port of London was taken on the31st August by the Defence Preparedness Committee.     The removal of3,000 tons of butter was completed on the 3rd September, of 7,000tons of meat on the 4th September, and of 30,000 tons of tea -20,000 tons to the provinces and 10,000 to dispersed warehouses inor near London - on the 14th September,     These quantities were dispersed,  though less than those included in the original plans,because in the case of butter and meat heavy withdrawals had been

made from bulk stocks &quot;by traders, and in the case of teas of thedifficulty which would arise in releasing supplies for consumptionduring the process of dispersal.     The position is regarded as satisfactory.     The goods were requisitioned.     The estimated costof the dispersal, including transport and labour, is  325,000.(b)   Stocks in the country.The appendix contains figures of the stock position of the mainfoodstuffs at the latest dates for Y/hich returns are available.The returns relate mainly to stocks in first hands.    estimates have been included in certain cases of stocks held by secondarywholesalers and retailers, together with notes on the UnitedKingdom crops.     The column &quot;weeks&apos; supply&quot; is calculated withreference to normal peace-time consumption.Stocks of flour, including wheat in terms of flour at 70 percent, extraction and allowing for the home crop, amount to morethan six months&apos;  supply assuming that the whole is used for human consumption.    Actually it has been necessary to deferimposing restrictions on the feeding of wheat to livestock owingto the present shortage of other feed grains.     It is in feeding-stuffs that the position is weakest, particularly in maize whichis entirely imported.The stocks of tea and of sugar, including the home beet crop,are good.The stock of meat must always appear to be low, because thatheld in cold stores is little more than a working stock.     Theprincipal reserve of meat is the stock on hoof in the country.As regards fats,  there is a large supply of whale oil, and rather more than four weeks&apos;  supply of oilseeds and nuts.As regards canned goods, the stocks held by importers and merchants were exceptioanlly low at the outset of the war owing to large scale deliveries to wholesalers and retailers in the previousweeks.      It may be assumed that a large part of these deliveries isnow held by the public.

Factors in the present situation,.The ifollowing paragraphs show particular difficulties at the presenttime.The purchase of oversea supplies is being concentrated in the handsof the Ministry, and this will lead to substantial advantages by the elimination of competition.     Oversea markets are, however, necessarilydislocated by war conditions.     Quotations show heavy rises in price.     Inaddition, and apart . from exchange difficulties, costs are increased in thiscountry by the rise in freight and war risks.Oversea, supplies of some commodities have been held up or delayed.Shipping facilities have been curtailed by various causes includingrequisitioning for defence purposes.     Arrivals have been irregular owing tothe necessity for diversion of ships and retarded pending the institution of convoy.     There have been losses of a few cargoes (maize from the River Plate)owing to submarine attack.     The negotiations which have now been proceedingfor some time at the Board of Trade with representatives of neutralGovernment shipowners (particularly Greek and Norwegian) for the use of neutral tonnage are being closely followed.     A satisfactory and earlyconclusion to these negotiations is of the highest importance to the Ministryof Pood to relieve the difficulties which are now being experienced in shipping cereals and sugar.Butter and bacon are instances of shortages arising from thesecauses.     The supplies of both these commodities from North European countries have necessarily been smaller.     Moreover no cargoes of Canadian bacon had arrived for three weeks until two ships docked on the 1st October.     TheMinistry are building up gradually a reserve of such commodities as meat andbacon to safeguard against temporary cessations of supplies at any time duringthe war.     Allowing for this, the result has been to reduce by approximately50 per cent, the supplies of bacon available for the population in thiscountry.     The price of pigs has been fixed deliberately at a level whichshould encourage producers to keep on their pigs to bacon weights.     Thereare ample supplies of margarine as a substitute for butter.

Future imports;    Progress of negotiations for long-term contracts.Cereals.The main difficulty arises on maize,  the price of which &quot;before thewar was abnormally high in relation to wheat.     Treasury authority hasbeen obtained for purchases for immediate shipment from the United States.South African and Roumanian supplies will be available shortly.The &quot;wheat position is easier.     Some purchases have been made from Argentina to meet immediate requirements.     Large purchases have beenmade of Australian wheat-     A purchase of ten million bushels of the newCanadian crop for storing in Canada was made before the outbreak of war.This will be available for shipment when required.Freight difficulties exist in the shipment of cereals generally.Meat,It is hoped to conclude negotiations in the near future with australia and New Zealand for forward contracts covering all meat which canbe shipped from the eg Dominions over the next twelve months at a, pricebased on the average wholesale prices in 1938.     It is hoped to concludesimilar arrangements with Rhodesia,     Negotiations for purchases from south iimerica have been more difficult particularly on price questions and exchange, but are proceeding,J3acori and ham,,It is hoped that negotiations will shortly begin withrepresentatives of the Grovernments of Denmark, Sweden and Lithuania forlong-term purchases of bacon and ham to replace the existing unorganisedarrangementso     Negotiations are proceeding with Balkan countries in regardto their surplus stocks,,^HJi^r^ cheese; eggs.^Negotiations -are well advanced with the Dominions of Australiaand New Zealand for the purchase of their butter and cheese.      It is contemplated that sLnilar arrangements will be possible in regard to eggs.It is hoped to include butter and eggs in the negotiations with Baltic-countriesc

sugar.Arrangements have been made with Empire Sugar Producers for thepurchase of one year&apos;s sugar requirements,     The amount exceeds one million tons.     The price, owing to the helpful co-operation of the producers, is onthe basis of 7/6d0 per cwt., equivalent with preferences to about 13/- percwt., compared with the present price in New York of 16/- per cwt.     the cuban producers have, in addition to increasing prices, declined to completecontracts at agreed prices;    contracts with them for some 30,000 tons have accordingly been cancelled,Whale oil.British whalers will be operated on Government account during thewhaling season which will shortly begin.     Negotiations are proceeding with japanese whaling interests for the purchase of their catch next Spring;    theyhave not yet begun with Norwegian interests,Oilseeds.Satisfactory arrangements have been made for the purchase of theprincipal oil-seeds and vegetable oils from West Africa, India and Egypt.Good supplies of linseed are available in the country.Storage.At the outset of the war the Department brought under their controlall commercial cold storage plants with a capacity of 2,000 cubic feet andover.     This ensures that the maximum use is made of the existing plant inthe country, but it is already apparent that the capacity will be insufficient,especially in the neighbourhood of the West Coast ports.     Proposals have beensubmitted to the Treasury for the erection of additional cold storage accomodation.jmstry^of Food.^llOctober, 1939.

SOBo.MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESREPORT ON FOOD PRODUCTION CAMPAIGN.GsneralThe primary aim of the food production campaign is to plough upsomething like 1^- million acres in the United Kingdom0     Farmers have &quot;been askedJby broadcast to plough up 10 per cent, of their grassland (rather more than]i million acres).      It is hoped that all this land will be ploughed by the endof the spring and be available for harvest in 1940c      The crops recommended forsowing on the new arable acreage are wheat, potatoes and certain fodder crops(including barley and oats).      In Scotland oats is to be one of the chief cropsto be expanded,,      It is proposed that the sugar beet acreage should be at leastmaintained.      In order to encourage early ploughing the  2 per acre ploughing-upsubsidy under the Agricultural Development Act (which had already by theoutbreak of war induced a fair amount of ploughing up) is being continued to theend of the year0Local organisation to carry out this programme County War Agricultural Executive committees have been established in each county.      These Committees have been informed,county by county, as to how many thousand acres they are expected to have ploughedup.    After determining the appropriate allocation of this acreage farm by farm,in the light of each farm&apos;s circumstances,  the Committees have power to serveorders requiring the work to be done,  or, in cases of default, to take possessionof the land.     The Committees will also assist in allocating to farmers theirshares of the available supplies of labour, feeding-stuffs and fertilisers.Certain difficulties may arise before the food production programmels completed, and these can be surveyed under the following heads:-credit on grounds of general policy prices of the principal farm produces&quot;ave been fixed or are being fixed provisionally at pre-war levels, and largenumbers of farmers have neither the cash nor the credit to undertake theadditional operations required of them.     Although their financial position may

be expected to improve in course of time, at present lack of financial resources is limiting the expansion of production.Labour and Tractors.The ploughing-up campaign will probably require extra labour even ifthe pre-war labour force works harder and longer0     It is hoped to augment thelabour available (a) by using such members of the Women&apos;s Land Army as can be suffiently trained in time;    (b) by distributing the Ministry&apos;s reserve of1,500 tractors which had been accumulated at the outbreak of war;    and (c)acquiring new tractors.Nearly 30,000 members of the Women&apos;s Land Army have enrolled orapplied for enrolment,  and 700 girls are in training in Institutions inaddition to those being trained on farmso     This number will be appreciablyincreased^     Over 400 trained tractor drivers are available under the schemestarted before war broke out.The labour difficulties which have already arisen in connection withthis year!s harvest are well known.     The War Office have made soldier labour available for securing the corn harvest, and it is hoped to extend these arrangements to cover the potato and sugar beet harvests.There was a shortage of labour even under peace conditions.      It was at once accentuated by the general mobilisation,.      The War Office haveprovisionally agreed to consider a limited number of individual releases of key men.Implements.Steps are being taken to augment supplies of ploughs and certain otherkinds of farming tackle.     Six hundred ploughs have been purchased from north america;    further orders are under consideration.It is hoped to distribute the first allotment of tractors and ploughsbefore the end of September, grtiJLisers and Seeds,The supply of none of the essential seeds required for the foodProduction campaign is expected to present difficulties.

0 9As regards fertilisers, only about two-thirds of a year&apos;s supply ofpotash is in this country.     The possibility of obtaining further supplies from palestine is being explored.      Sufficient sulphate of ammonia will be forthcomingif the factory at Billingham continues to produce at its pre-war rate4 and if one half of its output is available for agriculture.      Superphosphate depends on thesupply of pyrites or sulphur for making sulphuric acid and upon the supply ofphosphate rock;.    the latter may be obtainable from French North Africa,      some government reserve stocks of pyrites,  sulphur and phosphate rock are held.Supplies of lime and basic slag present little difficulty.Horticulture.Powers similar to those used in the last war have been erirusted toUrban Authorities with a view to increasing production from private gardens andallotments,Urban Authorities throughout England and Wales have been asked toappoint Horticultural Committees to advise private gardeners and allotment holders.Crops of 1959.As regards the amount of home-grown food resulting from the harvestsof 1939, we are entering war conditions in a fairly satisfactory position.,Yields per acre of corn, potatoes and fodder crops (including hay) are expectedto be not far off the ten-year averages, while sugar beet and apples are aboveaverage.     The hay crop has suffered damage from weather conditions, but presentconditions of pastures are exceptionally good.Feeding-Stuffs.Owing to the diversion of cargoes, causing extra transport costs, andfor other reasons,  including the uncertainty as to future prices, the tradein feeding stuffs is being held up and complaints are reaching the Ministry from farmers of inability to obtain supplies.      In order to meet this situationInter-Departmental discussions have taken place with a view to stabilising prices for a time on the basis that any resultant loss would be borne on the tradingaccount of the Ministry of Food.     A new Order fixing a scale of maximum prices or different kinds of feeding-stuffs is in preparation and will be issuedshortly.     in the meantime everything possible is being done to set suppliesloving again.      The question of the prohibition of the use of wheat for feedingto lives-cock has been considered and deferred in view of the present shortage ofother feed grains, such as maize.^ 5.

^vestock.It is the general aim to encourage the continued production of livestock and livestock products in this country to the maximum possible unless and until shortage of feeding-stuffs renders it necessary to reduce thenumbers of certain kinds of stock,,      The price fixed for the purchase of pigswill give a bias towards the production of pigs for bacon, but no prohibitionhas yet been introduced as regards the use of pigs for fresh pork.Animal Diseases.At the present moment there are 24 different premises on which footand mouth disease has occurred recently and which in consequence are still underrestrictions.      Sixteen of these premises are in Hampshire, four in Lindsey,two in Dorset and two in Huntingdonshire,  and infected areas exist in these four counties.      The most recent outbreak of the disease was confirmed on20th September at Burley, Hampshire,
