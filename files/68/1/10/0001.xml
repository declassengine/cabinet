pnHTTMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)rJpW39) 10. COPY NO.WAR    CABINETHONE SECURITY REPORT No.2Second Weekly Report submitted by the Minister ofHome Security covering; the period from noon 8thSeptember to noon 15th September, 1959.(Previous Report:    Paper No. W.P.(R)  (39) 4)Air Raid Precautions. Seryices1.      Considerable progress has been made in establishing a proper shift system which will put an end to the excessivespells of duty of some volunteers both whole-time and part-time.2.      A review is now being undertaken in conjunction withthe Regional Commissioners of the position of the whole-timepaid personnel.    It Is the basic principle of the A.R. P.Services that they should be in a position to go into action at very short notice (the air raid warning represents 12 minutesflying time).      This means that some persons must always bestanding by throughout the 24 hours.    Under present conditions the whole-time personnel engaged is in some areas unnecessarilylarge and the method will have to be adopted of organising a first line nucleus service which ensures manning of essentialPosts all round the clock, and an additional reserve serviceliable to be called up at short notice when air raid conditionsdevelop.    By this means it will be possible to let a number of whole-time A.R.P,  personnel go back to employment.3.      There can be no question of suggesting any generaldemobilisation of A, R. P. personnel.    This v/ould disorganise a service which is now finding its feet, and might be misunderstoodabroad.

GO4.      There are complaints not only Prom rural areas, hutalso in industrial areas such as Lancashire, that the rates of pay for Civil Defence workers are withdrawing valuable labour from ordinary employment.    These difficulties, which affect farsmaller numbers than has been suggested in the Press, will be eased by the temporary reduction in the number of whole-timepaid personnel standing by under present conditions.Agricultural labourers are not eligible for whole-time service in A.R.P.  as they are in a Reserved Occupation.    It will bepossible to release, subject to recall, a number of skilledbuilding trade operatives who are in Rescue Parties, thoughhere again the number of such operatives who would beavailable for ordinary constructional work is very much lessthan has been supposed.Shelters and Works5.      Progress continues in the preparation of public shelters,and in many of the vulnerable areas the situation is much more satisfactory.    There are, however, some areas where the shelterposition is not good, and special attention is being concentrated on these.    In view of the claims upon materials and labour for other Defence Services, the programme of shelterin the vulnerable areas may take 6 months to complete.6.      It is hoped that the arrangements for putting on saleeach week in the vulnerable areas a limited number of steelshelters may shortly come into operation.      This depends,however, on the question whether the production of the steelsheets can be restored approximately to its earlier figure;considerable improvement has already been effected.7.      Shelter for workpeople in industrial establishments isestimated now to cover about half the workpeople;    theproportion is much higher in factories engaged on work of vitalimportance.

warning System8.      An examination of the warning system has teenconducted with the Air Officer Commanding in Chief, fighter command.    Some minor modifications have been arranged which  /ill slightly reduce both the areas under warning, and theperiod of the warning, but the examination confirms the view expressed in the First Report that substantially the presentsystem must stand until experience has been gained of actualraids.Lighting9.      General lighting restrictions are being maintained,but modification of the restrictions on driving lamps, andpermission to pedestrians to use torches, will make movementin the streets easier than it was.10. The possibility of allowing a little more street light-ing is under examination with the Air Ministry.11.      It is not found practicable at present to modify thegeneral lighting restrictions in the rural areas.12.      Chief Constables are exercising their discretion in granting exemptions for industrial lighting.    In thevulnerable areas, especially those on the sea coast, there isconsiderable popular feeling against any widespread exemptionsfor industrial lighting, and although the Chief Constables arcdoing all they can to assist industries engaged on work ofnational importance, they have to take account of local feeling in the matter.Emergency ^ire-l^igade, Me as ur es13. While in some localities the Auxiliary Fire service personnel is still below requirements, in some other placesdifficulties have arisen through men, who joined the A.F.S.on mobilisation and are no longer required for whole-time duty.

i 1losing their employment.    Steps are being taken to adjust thenumbers of whole-time and part-time personnel to currentrequirements? while maintaining a sufficient state ofpreparedness in vulnerable areas.Casualty Services14.      The number of vacant beds in England and Walesaccording to reports received up to noon on 15th September,1939, was over 194,000, as compared with about 193,000 lastweek.    In Scotland 14,500 beds    are available.15.      It has been suggested that doctors should not berequired to report for duty at aid posts until it is obviousthat their town or district has actually been raided.16.      An emergency laboratory service has been organised bythe Medical Research Council, in consultation with the Ministryof Health and Department of Health for Scotland, to augment theexisting facilities for bacteriological diagnostic work requiredfor public health purposes.Compensation for Disablement or Death17.      The scheme for compensation in cases of civilian injuryhas been issued, and information as to the Ministry of Pensions&apos;arrangements has been embodied in leaflets issued to localauthorities.    Pull notices have also appeared in the Press.Public Order18.      Public morale is reported to be excellent throughoutthe country.     In a few places fascist or pacifist anti-warleaflets or posters have appeared, but such activities arenoticeably few.19-     Arrangements have been made for the opening of cinemasln all areas subject to a closing hour of 10 p,m.   (6 p.m.  in central London), with exceptions where there would be specialrisk.

Evacuation20.      The planned evacuation was completed with theevacuation of Jarrow, Hebburn and Sunderland on the 10thand 11th September.21.      The complete returns show that the numbers evacuatedhave been somewhat less than were estimated on the basis of thefirst returns.22.      The total numbers evacuated in England have beenNumber Percentage ofEvacuated those evacuableSchool children withteachers and helpers.            750,000 42Young children andtheir mothers 435,000    )j 26Other groups 19,000    )23.      Both in England and Scotland there has been some driftbach, particularly among mothers with young children who have failed to settle down in the country.    Every endeavour is beingmade by broadcast and by letter to discourage such action.    Allthe evidence is that the unaccompanied school children havesettled down tolerably well.24.      There has been a substantial body of complaint from the receiving areas as to the condition and habits of a proportionof the evacuees, particularly of the mothers.    The complaintshave been particularly strong in districts which were receivingareas for Liverpool and Glasgow;    and it is clear that in the reception areas for Glasgow there will be opposition to the reception of any further evacuated persons.25.      Administrative action has been and continues to be taken and indications are that the problem is manageable.     It is not proposed in the near future to send any further mothers withyoung children to the receiving areas.26.      The further opportunity for parents to register their

school children met with only a limited response:    the numbersregistered in the whole of Scotland were roughly 10,000 andin London only about 8,000.27.      The possibility of making arrangements for theevacuation of small children in groups without their mothers isbeing examined.Public Assistance28.      The Unemployment Assistance Board have brought thescheme fov Prevention and Relief of Distress due to the war into full operation and have set up emergency stations in reception areas to deal with need among mothers and other approvedrefugees.     On 8th September 1939 (the latest date for which figures were available) allowances under the scheme were being paid,  or were under consideration,  in 43,000 cases of which40,000 were approved refugees.    The remaining 3,000 weremiscellaneous cases of distress due to war conditions.Schools29.      On September 9th the general rule that all schools inevacuation areas were to remain closed was relaxed to the extentof allowing the opening of technical institutions for thetraining of members of the fighting Forces and of workers engaged in industries necessary for the prosecution of the war.30.      The opening of schools in neutral and reception areas is proceeding, but there is evidence that in some of the latterareas opening is being delayed owing to the absence of air raidPrecautions which, having regard to the nature of the localities concerned, appear unnecessary.Railways31.      The reduction of passenger train services has resultedln seme overcrowding.    In connection with suburban services, ithas been found possible to restore a number of trains and thePosition is rapidly improving.    The problem is more difficult

i&quot;4 Ain connection with long distance services.    Reduction isnecessitated &quot;by heavy loading of main lines with freight traffic and the position is much aggravated by lighting restrictions which impede loading and unloading and shunting and involvemaximum freight train working by day.    Long distance passengertrains have been increased in size to the maximum possible butthe benefit of this increase is counterbalanced to some extent by the consequent reduction in running speed.Docks and Harbours32.      The position at the ports continues satisfactory.    the pressure on the West Coast has lessened, partly through thegreater use of London for the deeper draught ships and partly because of the delayed arrivals of homeward bound ships as aresult of Admiralty precautionary measures.Road Transport.33.      During the week there has been very heavy pressure on the Ministry&apos;s organisation in connection with the first issueof fuel ration coupons.    Reports from all Regions on Friday15th September indicated that the issue of coupons for the basic ration would be complete by the evening.34.      The impressment of vehicles for the armed forces, Armyhirings and the immobilisation of vehicles for civil defence purposes are causing local shortages of vehicles.    So far no serious situation has arisen from this cause.35.      Requisitioning of vehicles for civil defence purposescontinues, but on a small scale.    The greater part of therequirements have apparently been met by voluntary arrangement.No reports have yet been received of the effect of the releaseof vehicles by civil defence authorities for ordinary work whennot otherwise needed.36.      Restriction of passenger services after dark continues.

i home Office,19th September, 1939.In many areas winter services are in operation.    There hasnot, however, been any general complaint of inconvenience tothe public.Evacuation of Government Departments37.      The work of preparing for occupation as offices thepremises requisitioned in the Western and Worth-western counties for alternative accommodation for Government staffsis proceeding.38.      Certain general aspects of this matter have been underconsideration by the Home Security Committee with a view toreporting to the War Cabinet in due course.J. A.
