(R)  (59) 56.COPY no war    cabinet home SECURITY REPORT No.4.Fourth Weekly Report submitted by the Minister ofHome Security covering the period from midnight24th September to midnight 1st October, 1959.(Previous Report:    Paper No. W.P.  (R) (39)  22)Air Raid Precautions services.       Arrangements for revising establishments for whole-timepaid A.R.P. personnel will shortly be completed.Lighting Restrictions.2.       A review of the present lighting restrictions is being held by the Ministerial Committee on Lighting Restrictions.    Inthe meantime the Department has been dealing with individual cases where temporary relaxations of the present restrictionsare necessary in the interests of production.      modifications of the restrictions on vehicle lighting have been published andwill be embodied in an amending Lighting Order.      A headlampmask complying with the new conditions is in course ofproduction and will be issued to local authorities and police authorities for official vehicles as soon as supplies become available,  and masks of a similar design are being manufacturedby the trade.       Experiments are also being carried out to se^whether any system of reduced street lighting can be producedwhich will at the same time be consistent with the needs ofnational defence and enable vehicles and pedestrians to movewith greater comfort in the streets.Shelters.3.        The rate of delivery of domestic steel shelters has

increased in the last three weeks to above the pre-war figure.This week deliveries will be at the rate of 54,000.Regional   Commissioners have been asked to pay special attentionto all areas in their Region which are behindhand in the provisionof public shelter, and from the replies which have been receivedit is clear that this part of the shelter programme is being pressed forward as rapidly as the supply of materials and labour will allow.4. Instructions have been issued telling householders thebest way to improvise shelter in their houses.    A pamphlet on thissubject will be issued early next week.Restrictions on Public Entertainments.5. Arrangements have been made with the appropriate controllingbodies for limited numbers of people to attend sporting fixturesat football grounds and greyhound racing tracks.Cinemas,  theatres and other places of public entertainment havebeen allowed to open till 10 p.in.  except in the Central London area where the closing hour was fixed at 6 p.m.      The size of theCentral London area for this purpose was reduced on the 30thSeptember and at the end of the period under review arrangements(which have subsequently made considerable progress) were in hand for allowing a. proportion of the places of public entertainment inthat area to be open till 10 p.ra.Emergency Fire Brigade Measures.6.        A circular was issued to all fire brigade authorities on the29th September asking them to review the number of emergency firefighting appliances kept ready for immediate action and the numberof whole time paid personnel in their auxiliary fire service.    Theeffect should be to reduce the number of whole-time paid volunteers,particularly in the less vulnerable areas.

^agualtv Services.7.        On Sunday,  October    1st,  the number of vacant beds in Englandand Wales was 181,000.      This reduction of 4,000 on last weekVsfigure,  taken with the fact that additional beds continue to be distributed,  show that the reflux of ordinary sick to hospitals is proceeding.    In Scotland 13,350 beds were available on 1st October.8. Arrangements are under consideration for releasing a largenumber of the beds that are being held for casulaties in the smallerhospitals and other institutions and allowing them to resume their normal functions.      The opinions of the Hospital Officers have been secured as to the institutions which could now be dispensed with forthe present.    Most of these beds can be made available again at short notice if required.9.       Works for upgrading and increasing the accommodation of hospitals continue steadily.    Reports from the engineers who havebeen allocated to the sectors of the London Region show that, withfew exceptions,  the engineering works are so far completed at the majorhospitals in the London scheme that these hospitals are now readyto function immediately as surgical hospitals.10. A second interim payment to voluntary hospitals in Englandand Wales has already been made in some cases, and statistical   returnsfrom hospitals are being examined with a view to a third paymentvfhich will take account of beds occupied as well as those reserved.11.      The Ministry of Health is in consultation with the Ministryof Home Security on the question of substantial reductions in whole time personnel for first-aid posts and for the ambulance service inEngland and Wales.Svaquat ion.J-2. In accordance with arrangements made between the evacuatingand receiving authorities,  steps are being taken to evacuate those

2* o^0Classes	8th September 1939.	15th Seutember 1939	22nd september 1939Evacuated persons	40,000	46,000	34,000Other cases	3,000	17,000	25,000Total	43,000	63,000	59,000children who registered under the supplementary scheme.13.        Plans are also being made for the evacuation frjm time totime of expectant mothers, either individually or in small groups,and also of young children so far as arrangements can be made forthem to be accommodated without their mothers.    It is not proposed at present to make further arrangements for the evacuation ofmothers.14.        In the receiving areas, the main problems are:    the difficultcases not suitable for billeting;    the provision of clothes andshoes adequate for country wear in the winter;    the developmentof social welfare work, particularly among the mothers;    and additional hospital provision.      The drift back to the towns doesnot appear as yet to have been arrested, despite the appeals that have been made.15.        Consideration of claims by certain neutral areas in scotland to be classified as sending areas is being deferred until the supplementary evacuation is completed.Public Assistance.16. The evacuated, persons with whom the Board are concerned are for the most part women with children, usually under 5 years of age.The figures given below refer only to applicants and do not includechildren or other dependants.    As forecast in the previous report,the figures show a fall in the number of evacuated persons receivingallowances and a continued rise in the number of other cases.

17.    The Board of Education has issued a circular to Local EducationAuthorities suggesting arrangements,  short of opening the schools,for attending to the education, health and recreation of children in evacuation areas.Railways.H18.       There have heen no developments of special importance.Passenger services have heen maintained.    Freight traffic has heenheavy and is increasing,  owing partly to diversion of traffic from1Iroad transport,    There has heen congestion on some parts of therailway systems due to this additional traffic and to thedifficulties arising from lighting restrictions.Schemes for additional railway facilities are under considerationIand approval has already heen given to six new junctions to facilitate 1Itraffic diversions round London,Docks and Hahours.19.        The position generally continues satisfactory.    Slacknessin the east caost ports - particularly London - is marked.    Thefirst convoys are now arriving from overseas and the vessels haveheen allocated to appropriate ports.        Considerable difficulty is being experienced in handling prize cargoes.    Efforts are beingmade to speed-up the machinery for dealing with these cargoes and toreduce the delays both before and after discharge, but theprocedure to he followed involves legal proceedings and is not easily   (accelerated.Road Transport.20.        The first week of fuel rationing has not occasioned any butminor difficulties.      This is doubtless due in part to instructions issued to the Regional Transport Commissioners that it is moreimportant at the opening stage of the rationing scheme to keep

/id jtransport moving than to secure any predetermined economy in fuel.21.        A few further cases of excessive charges for road transporthave been reported.22.      Impressment of vehicles for the Army continues and is causinga certain amount of discontent among operators as, owing to the limited age class and the types of vehicle   required, the weightof these demands cannot he evenly distributed but falls mostheavily on the operators v/ho maintain up-to date fleets.    TheMinistry&apos;s organisation so far as can be ascertained has been ableto arrange for alternative transport when approached.23.      Requisitioning for civil defence purposes continues but or a reduced scale.      Civil Defence authorities have released a number of vehicles for ordinary work on the understanding that they are tobe at call if required.Evacuation of Government Departments.24.        The premises requisitioned for use as offices are,  generallyspeaking,  now ready for occupation.25.      There have been further moves of 550 staff of the Customs and excise Department and 150 staff of the Air Ministry to theirprovincial locations.26.      Steps are being taken to provide protection against air raids for the staffs of the War Cabinet,  Service Ministries and theMinistry of Home Security,    The question of the protection to beprovided for other staffs is still under review.27.        The question of the erection of temporary buildings as a substitute for the accommodation requisitioned is under considera-tion by the Priority Organisation.      The First Commissioner ofWorks considers that arrangements should be made to start work on
