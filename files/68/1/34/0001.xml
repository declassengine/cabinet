Survey of German Propaganda during theSecond fortnight of the War.SOURCES:The chief sources used for this survey have been:-(1)(2)Monitored Broadcasts from German StationsCommunications intercepted by the Postal and telegraph Censor(3)Summaries of the Press in foreign capitals sent by II.M. Embassies, Legations or Consulates.Information received from a German SocialistMovement hostile to the Nazis.MAIN TRENDGorman propaganda during the second fortnight ofthe war,  and particularly during tho latter part of the fortnight,has been preparing the way for Hitler&apos;s peace offer.      Its mainoffensive efforts are still directed against Britain, but there arcsignificant changes in tactics.      Thus,  although the attempt to splitthe Franco-British alliance continues and is being pressed homoeloquently, our blockade has received a diminishing amount of attention lately.      Instead, attacks have been made in four nowdirections: -DIRECTIONS OF ATTACK(1)     Against the morale of the working class in thiscountry.      The themes are familiar - this is a capitalistwar made by the masters of a capitalist Empire;    so aretho personages, with the Jewish international financierwell in the foreground.     Propaganda of this characterhas been addressed to Europe in general and to Franceand Britain in particular.(2)      Against the cohesion of tho Commonwealth and of thoEmpire, with stories of trouble already in Palestine,at Gibraltar, and in India,  and confident assertions thatthe Empire is bound to break up as the result of this war.

9 M i(3)     Against the fighting spirit of our own people -witness the threat of a new and irresistible weapon(or a form of defence that cannot be overcome?), and,in the last few days,  the suggestion that if we donot make peace we shall have to fight Russia as wellas Germany.      It may be \significant that this latterthreat was not made in very firm language,  and thatit has not been repeated from Russia in any broadcast to us,  though RibbontroTo&apos;s statement at his departure from Moscow, including the throat, was broadcast, in russian.(h)      Against the endurance of our civilian population,with some use of quotations from our own presssuggesting hardships or discontent.      It is alsodeclared that Germany^ economic resources, impartiallysurveyed (by Dr. Goebbcls?), are superior to ours.COMMENTS.Mussolini,;s efforts for peace arc being seconded,according to American reports, by the Vatican,  so that peace,  ifit comes, will be a pax Romans..     There have been fewer cablesabout armaments;    this is probably a precaution in case of a stillunexpected peace.More important, perhaps, is the fact that besides the attempt to convince the world, of Russo-German solidarity, therehas been more than an echo of anti-capitalist talk in the Germanbroadcasts to Germans.      They have begun to sound sometimes almostlike the talks from Moscow in German which wore mentioned in the survey preceding this.It is too soon to say that the sham Rod Revolution inGermany, of the probability of which this Division was warned froma German source, has begun or even that its advent is clearlyforeshadowed.      It is not safe to say more than that there archints that such a development should not surprise us too much,whether brought about by the General Staff against the Nazis or by

9 .* 0-3-Nazis and General Staff together.The chief theme of Russian propaganda has been theglorious Rod Peace in Eastern Poland.      There is no suggestionthat Stalin feels that he can dictate a Russian peace to Europejust yet;    all the indications arc that he will play the gamerecorded on almost every page of Machiavelli&apos;s &quot;History ofFlorence&quot;, and played with such skill by V/olsey in his foreignpolicy.     The essence of the game is that you maintain betweenyour warring rivals a balance of power so nicely and for solong that it ends by becoming a balance of weakness *EFFECTIVENESS OP GERMAN PROPAGANDA.On one day (September 25th) there were complaints fromHis Majesty&apos;s representatives in Denmark, Norway,  and Brazil thatGorman propaganda, was more effective than ours because(a) there was more of it? and(b) it arrived more promptly.It is also said that Gorman propaganda, is having some effect inSwitzerland;    the late arrival of our newspapers in that country was noted in the first su.rvcy.JAPAN AND russia the tone of Japanese broadcasts is decidedly more friendly to this country than it was a short time ago.     Russianreferences to Japan are uniformly unfriendly in tone.
