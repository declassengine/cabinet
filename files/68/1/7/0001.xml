The telegramindicated tne principles which should govern the actionof Colonial Governments in the matter cf precautions against Italy in such circumstances.1st.SentepfL--;3r     The Precautionary Telegram was sent at p,u. naming germany and Italy.5rcl Sept ember -- Immediately after 11.0 o!clock the ParTelegram was sent,  stating that war had broken out withGermany.Censorship.Censorship was imposed in all Colonies from6 p0m.  on the 31st August.      The question of censoringconsular/

consular correspondence lias given rise to a number of enquiries which are being settled.      The censorshiparrangements appear to be working satisfactorily.HiJLi.tary Measures.On the 25th August, as a result of a decisionof the Defence Preparedness Committee, the regularAfrican Colonial forces were ordered to mobilize but notto move to their war stations.      On the 50th August allColonial Governors in Africa (except Somaliland) were informed by telegram that the War Office were assumingoperational control of all African Colonial Forces from midnight 31st August-1st September, and that the inspector General would become General OfficerCommanding, East African Forces, and assume command ofall forces in East Africa except those in Somaliland.The Chief Political Liaison Officer, Sir DonaldMacKenzic-Kennedy, Governor of Nyasaland, who had previously been designated for this appointment, was instructed to proceed to Nairobi with his East AfricanAssistants as soon as possible.The introduction of the Precautionary Stageinvolved the mobilisation of local forces in mostColonies,      It has been decided, however, with theconcurrence of the War Office that local forces in malaya and Hong Kong need not be mobilised at present.Similarly, the Rayal Naval Volunteer Reserve unit in hong Kong is not being fully mobilised.

Evacuation Schemes,After receipt of the &quot;stand-by&quot; Telegram theGovernor of Hong Kong thpk preliminary measures toenable evacuation of nohrcpi.fpata:xts to be brought intoeffect at ve.vg short notice;.      It ;/as subsecgieutlydecided,  ho\. eve::I,  that there uas no need to bring thescheme into effect, though a large number of women andchildren and other non-combatants left the Colonyvoluntarily before the outbreak of warnA similar decision was taken as regardsevacuation of wives and children of Service personnel from Malta.      Similarly, the Governors of Aden andSomali&apos;land were advised that,  despite the fact thatthe Precautionary Telegram had named Italy as well as germany,  there was no need to evacuate women andchildren.Enemy, Aliens     Internaent^ .etc.Before the outbreak of war Colonial Govern-meuts were informed of the procedure to be adopted inthe United Kingdom in regard to enemy aliens,  Includingrefugees and persons of former Czech nationality.Internment of enemy aliens has been completed without incident in Uganda, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland-, kenya and Palestine.      In Tanganyika it is complete in thechief centres,  and is steadily proceeding throughoutthe rest of the territory.      The ouestion of movinginterned enewy aliens in certain Colonies either to more healthy areas or to areas where their detention

4?is less embarrassing is under active consideration.Colonial Governments were instructed, beforethe outbreak of war,  that enemy consuls and consularstaffs were not to be allowed to leave the colonial territory in which they were stationed until asatisfactory assurance had been received from theenemy Government to the effect that British consulswould be allowed to leave the enemy country.The present position is that enemy consulsand consular staffs have not yet been permitted toleave Colonial territories.      It is understood, however that arrangements will be made shortly,  in conjunctionwith the Swiss and U.8.A.  Governments, which willenable them to do so.Economic Measures.For the purpose of conserving the exchange resources of the Empire, Finance (Defence)Regulations had been introduced by the 8th Septemberin the majority of Colonies and were in activepreparation in the rest,  on the lines of those inforce in this country.      A system of export control bylicence has also been instituted in. all parts of theColonial Empire.      The introduction of a system of import control Is under consideration.      In the matterof export control, Governments have been instructed torefer to the Secretary of State any applications forthe grant of export licences which present particular difficulties,  and close co-operation is thus retainedwith the Ministry for Economic Warfare and other interested

interested Departments.Measures nave been taken to increaseimmediately ex; orts of rubbbher and tin;    and theouestion oP marketing otherolonial products in wartime is under active considerationAgreement hasbeen reached with the Food Defence Plans department and Export Licensing Department on a provisionalpolicy regarding the supply of certain foodstuffs toColonies from this country.7.      Prise,. CourtsSte .)s have been taken to establish PriseCourts in those Colonies in which Prize Courtsfunctioned in the last war,  and in addition in thefollowing territories - Gambia, Kenya, Forth borneo and Palestine.

Cplloborjrti^ Minis/cry;of Iiiibramtipn.Close liaison between the Colonial Officeand the Ministry of Information is being maintained.Machinery has already been estalPP shed inalmost all Colonies and Information Officers appointed.In certain groups of neighbouring Colonies special arrangements have been made, or are being considered,for ensuring proper co-ordination between the individualInformation Officers.      For British publicity work inthe Par East,  including certain foreign countries, aspecial bureau is to be established, (either in KongKong

Kong or Singapore) in collaboration with the ForeignOffice under the Director Generalship ofMr. Pl. H.  Scott, Commercial Diplomatic Service.Certain equipment for publicity work in theColonies has already been ordered,  and further demandsare being received from Colonial Governments, all cfwhich appear anxious to co-operate.9,      PjDlitical Reapjfcipiis^ .etc^On the 5th September I telegraphed a personal message to all Colonies.      This was reproduced in thePress both here and in the Colonies.      I also asked allColonial Governors for an early report on the localreactions towards the outbreak of war.      The replies sofar received indicate that the decision of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to declare war on Germany is generally accepted by all communities as having been inevitable and right, and we have undoubtedly started the war withthe goodwill of the v/hole Colonial Empire.    (As the wargoes on opinion in certain colonies may lose some ofits enthusiasm, and In case of economic or socialdistress become positively difficult.      We shall haveto guard against this carefully).      A summary of the governors&apos;  replies is attached (Appendix l).      Thefollowing points may be specially mentioned -(a) Mp.Ia.ya.      The Governor and High Commissioner is anxious to secure a better suppl3r of news from thiscountry.      This request is under consideration withthe Ministry of Information as a matter of generalColonial a&quot; to 11 c a t i o n.(b)  Zanzibar.

o-    o    &quot;(b) Zanzibar     The British Resident anticipates nolack of solidarity so long as there is no conscri;otionfor service overseas, and has asked permission to publish an amouncenent that there will not be suchconscription.This is a matter of general policy regarding Africa, and is being considered by thevarious authorities concerned.Atte; ition is invitedin this connection to paragraph 10 of this report belowregarding a suggestion by the Governor of Uganda forthe isolation of Tronical Africa as a neutral area.(c) West Indies.The Governor of Jamaica,  in common with other Governors in the Went Indian area, reportsthat there has been a wave of intense loyalty among all sections of the community.     He has added a warning that this state of affairs may not be maintained unlesssuitable openings can be found for utilising the numerous offers of service for military and other duties.      This question is now under consideration,(id) Palestine.      It is interesting that the Arab and.Jewish communities in Palestine have both almost without exception, expressed their support for Britain;    andour difficulties in that country have, for the timebeing at any rate, been, reduced.10.      Proposal by the Governor of Uganda for the .\gelectionof Africa as a neutral area.Sir Philip Mitchell,  the Governor of Uganda,has put forward, in a personal telegram certain tentativeproposals for the conclusion of an intomationa1agreement declaring an area in Africa,  lying roughlybetween

&quot;J 1Richmond Terrace, S..W;1.September,  1959.between tlie Sahara in the north and the Zambesi in theSouth,  to be neutralised territory in which it would beagreed that no military operations should, take place.He has put forward this proposal on the grounds that nodecisive military decision can be obtained in Africa;and that no advantage comic be gained from militaryoperations there which could in any way counteract the grave political conseguenccs and the sufferings whichthe indigenous population woifdld endure if hostilitiesspread to Africa.      This Question is no; underconsideration with the Foreign Office,LI. II.

P-1 jfiThere have been some heavy withdrawals from the banksand hoarding of commodities but prices ar^. now beingcontrolled-      Great satisfaction has been expressed atthe enlistment of 500 men for the Royal Army ServiceCorps though the general opinion is that the numbershould be greater.MIDDLE east the circular telegram was not sent to palestine or TransJordan bat recent reports show thqposition to be as follows:-During the few wesks preceding the outbreakof war there was some deterioration in the security situation in Palestine.      A number of armed gangs havoonce more been active as the result of outside stimulus?and isolated terrorist outrages have continued.      Theoutbreak of war, however? has not tern marked by theappearance of any special trouble,  and doth the arab and Jewish communities have given evidence of theiranxiety to support Great Britain.      The Jewish Agencyhas placed its resources at the disposal of HisMajesty&apos;s Government? without prejudice to its attitudetowards the policy set out in the White Paper of May?1939,  while expressions of loyalty and support have beenreceived from the representatives of the Nashashibiparty and other moderate Arabs.On the 5rd September the High Commissionerreported that the Jews were increasingly inclined toco-operate with the Government and that? while the Arabattitude v/ould be opportunist and largely dictated bythat

frythat of the neighbouring states, there was evidence thatan-increasing number of Arabs were trusting that their.Gpportunitjr would be in associating- themselves with the.-   Government.i - Sir Harold MacMlchael added, however, -that.there were a number of Arabs who felt that there -was now a chance, by intensifying trouble,  to extract better terms than those contained in the White paper, but he did not expect that the resiponse by the villagers would be particularly enthusiastic.    Special measures are now beingtaken by the French authorities in Syria and the Lebanon toprevent the mufti and his associates from organising orassisting rebellious activities in Palestine.The Amir of TransJordan has sent a cordial message of loyalty and support to His Majesty the King.Aden There is no evidence of lack of solidarity.    all communities are traditionally loyal,  the only adversetendency in recent years having been due to imperceptoblimperceptible amount of dissatisfaction amongst the Arabsabout Palestine.    The only criticism of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is that steps might have been taken earlier; andthe distribution of leaflets over Germany is regarded as afeeble reply to German aggression.EASTSRJ^(Including Indian &quot;Ocean and Western Pacific) .kuWhen The Governor does not expect any lack ofsolidarity or of determination to carry on righteous war to successful issue,pgpg Kong The reaction of the British community is that noother course was open.    Chinese opinion solidly,if somewhatstolidly,  supports British opinion.pSlhya. Malaya is perfec perfectly calm and steady and thedecision of His Majesty&apos;s Government is recogjised as right.A better news service is,however, demanded.
