(p) (39) (7) )Note.      In this Report &quot;Colonies&quot;is used tocover not only Colonies in the strictsense, but also Protectorates and mandated. Territories;    and &quot;ColonialGovernors1&apos;  is used to include High.Commissioners and the British Resident,Zanzibar.PART 1.      OFJTERAL.1,     During the period, under review there have been ncmajor incidents to report from Colonial Dependencies.      Thefact that Italy has not entered the war has meant that allColonies have been free from any actual warlike happenings;the main problem faced, in this period has been that of adjusting economic and establishment arrangements to the new conditions resulting from the outbreak of war,     Part 1 ofthis Report deals with certain matters of general importance,while Part 2 contains notes of one or two matters of special interest relating to particular Colonies,The general question whether defence &quot;precautionswere to be maintained vis-a-vis Italy (which affects anumber/

number of Colonies very closely) was one on whichauthoritative advice was sought.     Following an exchange of semi-official- letters between the Foreign Office and theWar Cabinet Staff, Colonial Governors were informed in atelegram sent on the 21st September that for the present there could be no relaxation of precautions vis-a-vis Italy.2.     Utilisation jpf mail jDnwer.Active consideration is being given to this matter in consultation with the War Office and other Departmentsconcerned.      In certain Colonies (especially in the west indies) it will be of the first political importance toprovide opportunities of service overseas in a combatantunit or units;    and it is accordingly hoped that it will bepossible to authorise the Governors concerned to make anannouncement in the near future to the effect that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are prepared in principle to agree to thraising of such &quot;units at a later date.As a result of a discussion with the War Officeadvice is also being sent to Colonial Governments concerningthe procedure to be adopted as regards men who wish to leavethe Colonies to enlist in the forces here.      colonial governments are being informed, briefly,  that maintenanceof essential local industries and of local defence forces must be the first consideration, and that, having regard tothe operation of the National Service (Armed Forces) Act,volunteers are at present required here only in certain-limited categories.      It is hoped at a later stage to sendmore/

9 9\Jmore detailed, advice on the long range question of the utilisation of man power (especially European man power)which will, &quot;become available for service overseas.Tire Governors of certain Colonies (e.g, Kong Kong,the Straits Settlements and the Malay States, Cyprus and theWest Indies) are being ashed to advise as to the possibilitycf raising labour units from those territories for service with the General Duties Corps of the Army.3 *     Eneiiay; j^liens     int-ernmenif etc.Enemy Consuls and Consular staffs have now been permitted to leave Colonial territories, and all have deneso with the exception of three ex-members of the formerConsular staff in Palestine, concerning whom correspondenceis proceeding.The possibility of making arrangements for theremoval from Aden, Malta, Gibraltar, and East and West Africof internees,  together with their wives and children, isunder active consideration,  and the Governors of these territories have been asked to supply information as to thenumbers of those who would have to be removed, on theassumption that a certain number of those now interned mightbe released and. allowed to remain in the territory subjectto appropriate restrictions.     Those who would have to beremoved will be divided into(i)      those whose return to Germany at any time during the war is considered undesirable(e.g.  technicians, etc.)

ct *y(ii)      those to whose return to Germany thereis no objection..It is contemplated that those in the first category wouldbe interned either in the United Kingdom,  India or possiblyCeylon, and special arrangements made for the accommodation of their wives and children.      Those in the second categorywould be repatriated, to Germany with their families either on neutral ships or via the United Kingdom.In Tanganyika, Nigeria, Gold Coast, Malaya and hong Kong arrangements have been made for the release,  eitherunconditional or subject to appropriate restrictions, ofinternees of whose bona fides satisfactory evidence is obtained.4C     Enemy Property;.On the 11th September all Colonial governments were asked, by circular telegram, to enact legislation on the lines of the Trading with the Enemy Act, 1939, a draftof which had previously been furnished to them.Copies of legislation, which follows the modelclosely, have been received from Tanganyika Territory andthe Straits Settlements, and advice has been received fromthe undermentioned Governments that similar legislation hasbeen or will shortly be, enacted:-Northern Rhodesia, Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria.Gambia, Cyprus, Palestine   Aden, Somaliland,Mauritius, Ceylon, Federated Malay States,Hong Kong, North Borneo, Bermuda, Bahamas,Leeward Islands/

Leev;ard IslandsGrenada, St. Lucia,St. Vinc(ent, BarbadosTrinidad, british guiana*Colonial Governments have or are &quot;being furnished.with copies of all Orders, etc, made in the United kingdom under the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act, andhave been invited, to consider to what extent it may benecessary for them to take similar action.5 0     Edpnomieg Mea sures.On the outbreak of war the Colonial Office assumedcontrol of the economic and. financial policy of the Colonial.Empire to a much greater extent than would be regarded as appropriate in peace time.      This was inevitable in order to mobilise the full resources of the Colonial Empire for war.The purpose of this step was two-fold, the negative one ofembarrassing the enemy and the positive one of assisting theallied cause,      In seme cases, however,  the action takenserves both oboeotiye,s0     The negative action taken to embarrass the enemy was identical with that taken in thiscountry,,      As stated above, Trading with the Enemy legislativewas enacted in the Colonial Empire with the effect of stopping all payments to the enemy and placing enemy property in the various Colonies under the control of local Custodian:of Enemy Property,     Enemy vessels and cargoes, where found.,were placed in the Prise Court.      Export control was imposed in order to prevent the expert of Colonial goods to enemy countries, and. to control exports to contiguous neutrals insuch/

such a way as to ensure that goods did not find tholir wayindirectly to enemy countries.Positive action to assist the allied cause has heenmuch wider In scope..In the first place action has heen taken. In thefinancial sphere.     Financial Regulations have keen made inthe various Colonies parallel to those made in this country,Under these Regulations residents in all Colonies&apos;,have heen required to place at the disposal, of the localGovernment all foreign exchange of certain, kinds in their possession or coming into their possession.      In order to reinforce this arrangement,  it has heen made a condition, ofthe grant of an export licence to certain countries such asthe United. States of America.,  that the goods exported, tothose countries shall he sold in the currency of thosecountries and the resultant exchange he placed at thedisposal of the Government,Exchange secured in this way is used primarily topay for essential imports from foreign countries into theColonies concerned,  the balance being placed at the disposalof His I.iaoestyso Government.      To reinforce this policyimports are being controlled, and in particular imports from certain countries are being reduced to the lowest possibledimensions In order to economise exchange.In certain Colorles holders of certain foreignsectirities have been required to register them with theGovernment and prohibited from disposing of them without permission/

permission.In the economic sphere action has been directed to the two-fold end of reducing imports, particularly from foreign countries, and directing exports of goods requiredby the United Kingdom, other Empire countries and Prance, tothose countries in preference to other   destinations.Instructions have been issued to colonial governments to increase so far as possible the production of foodstuffs for domestic consumption.     Where these are insufficient,   arrangements are being made   to supplydeficiencies, preferably from adjacent Colonies, or, failingthat from the United Kingdom&apos; or ether Empire countries.      Ina number of Colonies price control has been imposed-   to prevenprofiteering and an increase in the cost- of living.The whole Colonial sugar crop, up to the   SlslkAugust, 1940, apart from supplies required for domestic consumption or contiguous Colonies, has been sold to theUnited Kingdom Government at a very moderate agreed price,For the time being all Colonial oil-seeds and vegetable oils are being directed   exclusively to this countryand arrangements are in train for their purchase by theUnited Kingdom Government on arrival at moderate agreed pricesA maximum price has been fixed for the tin in malaya corresponding to the price fixed in this country and export of tin has been accelerated, while at the same timethe Tin Regulation Scheme is being kept in existence.Arr an gemen t s/

PARTICULAR COLONIES.6       AFRICA.Nyasaland.The Acting Governor of Nyasaland has suspendedthe issue of licences for the recruitment of Nyasaland labour for service in neighbouring territories.     This action hasled to a protest by the Government of Southern Rhodesia, but so far no representations have been received from the Unionof South Africa.     The question is at the present moment thesubject of telegraphic correspondence with the ActingGovernor of Nyasaland.Northern Rhodesia.During the month the Governor of Northern Rhodesiareported that a number of men employed in the copper miningindustry were anxious to proceed overseas to join HisMajesty&apos;s forces.     The mining managers reported that copper-production would be seriously affected.     The Governora ccordingly/

9 f? 9ki o naccordingly introduced a regulation requiring persons engagedin essential industries to obtain permits to leave the country.The question of tho extent of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;scopper requirements has formed the subject of discussionwith the directors&quot; of the mining companies in London, as aresult of which it appears highly unlikely that there will bea   surplus of man power in Northern Rhodesia available lorutilisation   elsewhere.      The companies regard it as essentialthat the native labour supply should be maintained and consider that    the labour force may have to be increased by10 per cent,  to meet the required expansion in monthlyoutput, namely about 25 per cent.7.      VTOST INDIES, etc.In British Guiana there have been some    strikeson sugar estates owing largely to the suspicion of tho workersthat the producers were likely to make largely increasedprofits owing to the war.      It has now been explained to thoworkers that this is not the case.        Modest,  increases in wages are however being granted,0 .      FAR F.AST .In Hong Kong it is the war between China and Japanwhich has hitherto mostly affected the local situation.During the first half of September, as a result of fighting in the vicinity of Hong Kong,  there were temporary decrease;.;in supplies of those foods which the Colony normally importsfrom adjacent territories, but there is no cause forapprehension in the present instance..In/

In Ceylon there had been in recent months anacon-a situation of interneommunal feeling due mainly to (a)public discussion of the proposed reform of the constitution,in which the question of the representation of minority communities was given great prominence, and (b) the decisionof Ministers to dispense with Indian daily paid labourersemployed by Government - a move which led to retaliation bythe   Government of India.      The Governor now reports thai-, vlw;inter-communal disputes over the first question, which neverextended beyond the political sphere, have subsided since theoutbreak of war and will not re-emerge until the constitutionsIssue is    Dgain brought into prominence.     The feeling everthe second question,, -which was much more serious from apractical point of view, Pas also been eased for the present as a result of approaches made to the Government of India fora conference to discuss the questions in dispute.      TheGovernor has no doubt that the people of Ceylon of all racesarc behind us in the war.9.      JiJIlPI^ITAST,.The situation in Palestine, though much improvedup to date, continues to give some cause for disquiet as tothe future.     The High Commissioner reported in a telegram mi&apos;.&apos;28th September that there   had been little change in triegeneral situation in the past fortnight, but that there was still a definite undercurrent of    rebellion in the country,Gangs have continued active in certain areas, while in othersbanditry has increased,,     Nevertheless Arab opinion generallystill/

9 9 1*v is &apos;jstill shows a definite sympathy with the cause of the democracies and welcomes a change in world conditions which&apos;they hope may impede Jewish immigration, illegal as well aslegal,.     Arabs from all parts of the country, and the Arabpress?    have given expression to their feelings of loyaltyfor Great Bin.tain   and have offered their full co-operation.Jewish terrorism: appears to have been called off by those responsible for it, and Jewish opinion is solid insupport of the Allied cause.     Jewish co-operation with theGovernment has so far been on the whole useful and theiful.The Jewish Agency has organized the registration of Jews willingto offer their services.     The Arabs have no similarorganization, but with a vie?/ to relieving the Arabs of anyfear that the Government may be oneouraging the exclusive-organization of Jewish military formations and of any feeling that the services of the Arabs would not be equally appreciated,District Commissioners have been instructed to register the names of Arabs wishing to offer their services.     There is alimited scope for the employment of Palestinians for certain technical duties in ancillary army services.M o, M.Ri richmond T e rr ace,5th October, 1939.
