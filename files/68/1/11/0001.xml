WEEKLY REPORT ON ACTION TAKENI.      WAR. TRADE NEGOTIATIONS.EUROPEAt the o tbreak of the war and before the Minister ofEconomic harfare was appointed,  it was decided that so far as war Trade Agreements were concerned the important thing was to initiate negotiations with states adjacent to Germany,H.M. Representatives at the following posts were thereforeinstructed to approach at once the governments to which theywere accredited on the lines of certain dormant instructions which had been circulated bee/ore the war began as a basis forWar Trade Agreements:-NorwaySwedenDenmarkIcelandNetherlandsBelgiumPortugalGreeceFinlandIn certain other countries,  viz:LatviaLithuaniaEsthoniaBulgariaYugos] .a v ia-missions were instructed to urge the Governments to whichthey were accredited to limit to peace time levels their export to Gerraanj&apos;- of a long list of essential commodities, and toinform these governments that in default of such limitation &quot;byagreement H.M.G, would have to reconsider the situation havingpegard to the vital object held in view.2-     It will &quot;be observed that certain countries (including someadjacent to Germany) do not appear en the above list,  e.. g.-^ILz^rlancL.      The French have by prior agreement with H . M , Gundertaken the responsibility for negotiations, keeping usinformed.

1*1 ryi 0Snain. It was decided to go slow with Spain, partly owingto the disorganization of trade consequent on the Civil War(e,g.  complete inability as yet to obtain accurate statisticalj  &apos;     &apos;[data on which any rationing scheme could be based) and partlyso as to allow the Spaniards time to realise their dependence on our goodwill in securing essential imports.[taly.      A special case is being made of Italy and it is hopedtp send experts with the least possible delay to begin nego-tiations.?turkey.      The state of our Treaty negotiations was such thatit was felt inadvisable to add a complication to them byproposing at this moment a War Trade Agreement.,. 3. 3.R.      Owing to recent political developments,   to the absenceof any bargaining lever,  and to the great difficulty of oxer-using any form of control over Russian exports to Germany,   itwas considered better to mark time for the moment.Rumania &amp; Hungary..      It was decided before the war broke outnot to approach these two countries for the time being withregard to War Trade Agreements,  since it was considered thatthey would be quite unable to sign any agreement satisfactory to us without laying themselves open to German reprisals.The position is,  however,  under review.      Steps are being takenregarding Roumanian oil,   and touch is being maintained with the hungarian Legation in London.PIDDLE &amp; FAR EAST3-     As most exports to Germany from the Middle &amp; Par East aresea-borne,  and as both China and Japan are fully occupied with^nu conservation of their own resources for the purpose oftheir respective campaigns,  it was here too decided that forhp moment we should rely on our contraband control system and

defer negotiations.UjbA.h.     The present neutrality legislation rules out all questionof a War Trade Agreement.      On the other hand negotiations are proceeding at the request of the U.S.  Government to institute a system of navicerts or letters of assurance,intended to facilitate non-contraband trade,CENTRAL A SOUTH AMERICA5.     Until a policy with regard to our purchases from thesecountries can be evolved (an interdepartmental committee isbeing formed for this purpose),,  it is difficult to startnegotiations and it was therefore decided to follow for themoment the same line as for the Middle A. Par Past.II. FINANCIAL PRESSURE.6.     Telegraphic instructions were sent on 7th September tciiis Majesty&apos;s Representatives in Norway,  Denmark,   Sweden,Holland, Belgium,  Portugal and Greece,  that they should takeoho opportunity in connection with the negotiations for War-Trade Agreements to mention the question of financial assis-tance to Germany.      They werj instructed to explain that while we were not asking for any explicit assurance in the agreement regarding the limitation of financial assistance to Germany&apos;,7e might be forced,   if any serious  increase in such assistancebecame apparent,  to consider the reaction on the Agreement.111 - CONTRABAND CONTROL.I-     During the 9 days from September nth to September 12th the contraband Committee considered 118 cases of ships.      One of0Sc was a German ship and she was seised with her cargo.In 39 cases the cargo,  or part of the cargo,  was seized aniU 51 cases the cargo was released.      The remainder are stillan^r consideration.
