Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1939.SKCEET.Copy No.    43W.P. (R.) (39) 6.WAR CABINET.BURMA AT THE OUTBREAK OF WAR.First Fortnightly Report submitted by the Secretary of State for Burma,covering the Period, up to 11th September.1. General.UP to the period of acute crisis the country was generally quiet; the friction between Burmans and Indians, which has persisted since the outbreak over twelvemonths ago, was dying down even in the worst areas. Since war was declaredthere has been no deterioration, the only threat to internal tranquillity being thatnoted below under &quot; Economic [Internal).&quot;Unrest in Burma is generally due at bottom to agrarian difficulties, and theprice of rice is at present unfortunately low. It is not impossible, therefore, that,when the harvest is in, about the end of October, and new rents have to be fixed,there may be some discontent on which the subversive and ultra-nationalistelements will seek to work. If, however, war conditions bring about any consider-able rise in the price of rice, this will no doubt ease the possibility of trouble,which is not at any rate imminent at the moment.Ministers have shown a general willingness to co-operate in successful prosecution of the war; the Acting Governor has taken them fully into consulta-tion over the Defence measures taken and sees no reason to doubt that he can carry them with him.Legislature. The Lower House met for its August Session on the 28thAugust and on the 31st August the Acting Governor addressed both Houses onthe lines of the Prime Minister&apos;s speeches of the 24th and the 29th August, andLord Halifax&apos;s broadcast on the 24th. The Acting Governor included in his address a statement of the new openings which would be afforded to Burmans toparticipate in the active defence of their country (a point on which Burmanopinion has always professed to feel strongly) by throwing the Auxiliary Forceopen to Burmans as well as Europeans and by the intention to organise as soonas possible a Naval Volunteer Force and later an Auxiliary Air Force in whichBurmans would be eligible to serve equally with Europeans resident in Burma.A reaction to this address was the unanimous adoption by the Senate of a Resolu-tion approving British policy in relation to Burma and promising unswervingloyalty to the King. A similar motion was not moved in the Lower House asunanimous support was improbable.Press. Up to the crisis preceding war, the Burmese Press and manifestosissued by the Central Nationalist Organisation (&quot; Dobama Asi Ayon &quot;) showed a disposition to advocate that Burma should hold aloof from the war then seen to be impending, as no concern of Burma&apos;s, and to exploit the opportunity tosecure freedom from &quot; British Imperialism.&quot; Since the actual outbreak of warthe Burmese Press, even of the extreme left, condemns Germany&apos;s action and isnot. on the whole, disloyal in tone: it contends that Great Britain&apos;s support of the[19966]
2independence of small nations should apply to the particular case of Burma, but even the most extreme organs admit that domination by Great Britain is prefer-able to domination by Germany.The Indian Press in Burma, particularly Moslem papers, is more positive insupport of the British cause.The Governor of Burma (Sir A. Cochrane) has curtailed his leave and leftby air for Burma on the 11th September.2. Defence Measures.The following defence measures have been taken : (a) The Governor promulgated on the 4th September the Defence of BurmaOrdinance and the Rules thereunder.(b) The Examination Service on the Rangoon River has been put into opera -tion, and for this purpose the greater part of the Rangoon FieldBrigade, Royal Artillery, was embodied by Notification issued on the4th September.(c) Two officers and 100 men of the Rangoon Battalion, Burma AuxiliaryForce, have been called up and sent to the refineries of the Burmah oil company at Syr i am (near Rangoon) for guard duty as a pre-cautionary measure against possible sabotage; and 6 officers and 200men to guard other important points in the Rangoon area.(d) Restrictions on civil aviation have been imposed.(e) General telegraph and postal censorship has been established.(/) Garrison companies (reservists) have been embodied for the protection ofthe oil-fields at Yenangyaung and the pipe-line from there to Rangoon.3. External Relations.Nil.4. Economic.(a) Internal.A tendency by Indian retailers of foodstuffs to force up prices when war was declared might have led to trouble with Burman consumers. The danger wasaverted by the promulgation by the Acting Governor, at the request of theMinisters, of an Ordinance appointing District Officers to control food prices.(b) External.Arrangements have been made for the Burmah Oil Company (in combination with the affiliated Assam Oil Company) to proceed to the maximum production of aviation spirit when requested to do so by the Air Ministry. It is estimated thatit will be possible to produce 200,000 tons a year of aviation spirit surplus to theessential requirements of India and Burma, and this will be reserved for the AirMinistry.Z.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 12, 1939.
