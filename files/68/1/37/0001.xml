HTOUSTRIAL RELATIONS&apos;. 9 r 9cj/Wages, hours and conditions.1.     There is still a marked desire in all parts of the country, on the partboth of employers and workers, to refrain from any action which might createindustrial difficulties or impede the national effort.2.     At the same time the desire of labour not to create difficulties in thepresent situation does not imply any willingness to suffer reductions in realwages.      All reports show that the level of prices in the shops is thesubject of the closest attention by workers and their organisations and thatany rise in these sufficient to create a read drop in the purchasing power oftheir wages would result in demands for a rise in wages.     Arrangements havealready been agreed or are under discussion in some industries providing forthe regulation of wages by reference to movements in the cost of living indexfigure...5.     Apart from this, pressure for increased wages is likely to develop unlessthe workers are satisfied that other persons in the community arc not being allowed to retain large profits as the result of the war.4.      The question of payment for time lost during air redds became veryprominent as a result of the air raid warnings received during the first few days of war.     As a result of action taken by employers&apos; organisations and discussions with the workers1 organisations, arrangements have been drawn up and agreed ina number of industries which, it may be hoped, will help to establish a genera],practice for the future.5.     Representative bodies of both employers and workpeople are showing areluctance at this stage to encourage any general relaxation of recognisedworking conditions or of safeguards such as those provided by the provisions ofthe Factory Acts with regard to the employment of women on night work a.nd therestriction of overtime.     It is felt that while there may be difficulties inparticular cases it would be unwise, at least pending the reabsorption into industry of workpeople who have become redundant owing to contraction in peacetime occupations, to allow general relaxations at this stage.     All responsibleorganisations of employers and workers are agreed that it v/ould be ineffectiveand in fact disastrous to encourage the working of very long hours in the falseexpectation that by this means increased production can be obtained.     The1.

9 K *i-O      *- experience is that the result of very long hours is not to give increased production, &quot;but to add very substantially to the cost of production, toferment discontent, and so to sow the seeds of future industrial disputes.6.     Reluctance to agree to relaxations of conditions does not extend to such questions as the recognised need, in the interests of production, for the relaxation of established custom in respect of the employment of skilled men.The arrangements made in the agreement reached in the engineering industry onthis subject are getting under way.7.      There is thus evidence that the policy of encouraging the established jointmachinery in each industry to continue to operate in the usual way and tosettle for itself the special problems throvm up by the war, is right and isleading to greater results than would be achieved by any attempt by GovernmentDepartments to interfere with or override the conditions of agreements orestablished customs and practice for the sake of immediate greater production.8.      The Ministry is itself having, and suggesting to other Departments thatthey should have, constant consultation with representative organisations ofemployers and workpeople.     By seeking their help and co-operation, much canbe done to meet and to overcome in advance many of the inevitable difficultieswhich will arise, and such consultation will undoubtedly strengthen the already very evident desire of the workers to assist in the effort to win the war.It is with these considerations in mind that representatives of the british employers&apos; Confederation and of the Trades Union Congress General Council were invited to meet under the chairmanship of the Minister on the 4th October witha view to the establishment of a representative central Committee to advise the Government on all aspects of labour matters which are likely to arise.EMPLOYMENT AND ulTEId3LQYI.ZEt-IT.Unemployment Fpvures.9.      As compared with 14-th August, there was on 11th September a net increaseof 04,110 wholly unemployed persons, 5 casual workers and 15,111 short timeworkers.     The increase of 84,110 wholly unemployed persons is however, largelyaccounted for by an increase of 57,248 (7,882 men and 49,366 women) personsnot normally in the industrial field.      This latter increase probably includes a large number cf evacuated women seeking employment in the now area and persons not normally in employment who now seek paid employment.     The returnsdo not include many thousands of professional persons who are seeking employ-men t.

10.     The general effect of the outbreak of Par can now be seen.     At firstindustries connected with the export trade were compelled to stand off -*&quot;   Jvrorkers until plans for protecting sea-borne commerce came into opera.tion;trades dependent on the Railways for the transport of goods were affectedby the initial diversion of Railways for defence purposes.     The abrupttermination of the season at holiday resorts resulted in immediate dischargeof seasonal workers in those districts.     Evacuation arrangements end thetemporary closing of places of entertainment in vulnerable areas combined to cause a considerable increase in the number of unemployed persons in theentertainment, hotel and catering trades;    and firms engaged in non-essentialor luxury trades reduced their staffs as a precautionary measure.     other firms not engaged on Government work retained only their skilled men pending a turnover to Government contracts.     Moreover firms in vulnerable areas withuncompleted air raid shelters for employees sought to complete their arrange-ments before allowing their employees to attend in full force.11.     Such dislocation as was temporary has now been overcome but the weeklyreturns of 18th and 25th September show that there is a steady increase ofunemployment in what may be termed the miscellaneous type of worker.     On18th September there was an increase of nearly 100,000 and on 25th Septembera further increase of 55,000.     These later increases are largely amongstrestaurant, hotel and cafe workers, female private dromestic servants andcharwomen, male and. female clerks, typists etc., male and female shop assistants,male general labourers and female miscellaneous factory workers.       Similar,but noticeable, increases have also occurred amongst housopainters and decorators,unskilled fitters, female laundry workers, female telephonists, commercialtravellers, male canvassers, male motor lorry and van drivers and compositors,the only noticeable reductions as compared with 11th September being amongsttrawler and drifter fishermen, coal and coke yard men and male and femaletheatre and cinema employees.      The first two weeks showed a very high propor-tion of female unemployed but on 25th September the position is reversed andthe majority of the 55,000 are male workers, approximately 35,000 being malesand 20,000 females.     Geographically the increases are fairly general, withthe exception of the London Division, which has suffered exceptionally.12.      It is too early yet to say what the effect of the petrol rationing scheme will be but it may considerably curtail employment in the Distributive and allied Trades.

9 FNew Pact pries. u Q15.     Since the outbreak of war relatively large numbers of new factorieshave been decided upon.     The question of the location of these factoriesis a matter of considerable importance end provisional arrangements havebeen agreed on for the location of important new undertakings in such areas as South Wales and Lancashire.      There is still however a considerablereluctance by some engineering employers to locate new capacity away fromthe already crowded Midland area.     It cannot be too strongly emphasised that the greatest importance attaches to location arrangements which will aim at finding employment for the large pools of labour at present unemployed.Engineering.14.      The shortage of skilled engineering workers continues, but the effects of the dilution agreement in the engineering industry have hardly had time tomake themselves manifest.Building.15.      There has been some increase in the number of unemployed carpenters andbricklayers, but it must be remembered that even so the numbers (4,200 and7,500 respectively) represent a very small proportion of the total insured population in these occupations.     It has been found that so far as the urgenthutting programmes of Government Departments are concerned the timber supply will probably prove to be a limiting factor and a system of rationing throughthe mechanism of the Central Priorities Department and the Timber Control isunder consideration.     Action has been taken to prevent uncontrolled competition between Government building contractors for skilled labour.Transport.16.     The outstanding feature in the Port transport industry is the positionin the Port of London, where the number of men proving unemployment hasincreased by approximately 100 per cent.     This has no doubt been due partly to diversion of shipping to other ports and partly to the inevitable time-lagin organising inward convoys.Goal Mining.17.     Uncertainty as to the export trade had its effect in the areas mostdependent on foreign markets-     Of the men registered as wholly unemployed on 13th September, one-third were in the ViTelsh fields.     Other districtshowever were working above the seasonal level and some shortages were said to exist;    the nature and extent of these are not yet known.4.

Fishing;.18.     The latest returns indicate that some improvement has taken place ascompared with the first week of War hut the position remains serious aspossibly one half of those usually engaged in this industry are still idle.19.     The Central Register of persons with scientific, technical, xorofessionaland higher administrative qualifications now contains some 93,000 names.A considerable portion of it is necessarily dormant at this stage of thewar as the persons concerned are already engaged on v/ork of high national importance.20.     The Central Register began to function shortly before the outbreak of war,and up to the end of September orders for 4,695 vacant posts were received.Of these 441 were scientific, 2,114 industrial, 2,023 professional, and117 administrative and others.     3,4-79 names have been submitted to employersup to the same date.     Of the invitations issued to persons on the Registerin respect of vacancies notified, more than two-tMrds were refused, either bythe person to whom the offer was made or because his present employer declined to release him.     Scarcities are already revealing themselves in severalcategories of scientists and engineers.      The v/ork of the Register may prove to be, to a large extent, not that of fitting unemployed persons into vacancies,but that of redistributing the professional skill of the country.21.     Host of the orders so far have come from Government Departments, butprivate firms having Government contracts arc beginning to use the Registerto a substantial extent.22.      The Government Training Centres, which v/ere greatly depleted by the with-drawal of the soldiers at the outbreak of war, are now beginning to fill upa.gain.     Two which were previously Army Vocational Centres are being used forother purposes by the War Office, and tv/o others have been temporarily vacatedin order to enable adequate A.R.P. protection to be provided.      The 8 subsidiaryCentres, mainly recruited locally, remain open.23.     Recruitment for the Farm Training Scheme for boys, and for the GravesendSea School (now at Sharpness) continues.     Otherwise the scheme has been closed down.     Two of the Hostels in London for the reception of transferred boys andTHE CENTRAL REGISTER.TRAINING.JUVENILES.Juvenile Transfer Scheme.girls remain open.5.

Authorised Gpurses of Instruction.24.     The Junior Instruction Centres closed down genei-ally on the outbreakof war, &quot;but recently 29 have re-opened, 21 of them being in Wales.RPCilUTTING.25.     Since the 9th September the Par Office have increased their require-ments for men called up under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act from105,000 between the middle of October and the beginning of December to 140,000between the middle of October and the middle of Iloveiiiber.     A further acceleration-tion in the programme for the calling up of men for service in the Army has there fore been necessary.     It is now anticipated that by the middle ofNovember the remainder of the Militia (that is, men who were between the ages of 20 and 21 on 3rd June last)will have been absorbed in the Armed Forces,except for a small proportion who express a preference for Naval or Air ForceService.      It will accordingly be necessary before the end of November todraw on the next age group of men.26.      For this purpose a Royal Proclamation has been issued (on 1st October)making liable to be called up for service in the Armed Forces of the Crown allmale British subjects (with certain.in exceptions) who were within Great britain on 1st October and who on that date had attained the age of 20 but had notattained the age of 22.     The effect of the Proclamation is to make liablethe 21-22 age group and those persons who on 1st October had reached theage of 20 since 3rd June.27.      The men made liable by the Proclamation will be required to registerat a Local Office of the Ministry of Labour and National Service on Saturday,21st October and the arrangements for this arc well in hand.28.     After the end of November it is expected that the rate of intake intothe Army will be at least 40,000 a month.29.      During the past three weeks the particulars of 66,000 militiamen whohave been passed by the Medical Boards have been sent to the War Office, andall these men will have joined their units by 19th October.     The medical examination of the remainder of the Militiamen not reserved under the schedule of Reserved Occupations has been proceeding continuously since 21st September.The Medical Boards are also carrying out the medical examination of the 25,119men who have volunteered for service in the Army in their trade capacity sincethe outbreak of the war.     Volunteers who have applied for enlistment in the

9^nt* *j uArmy and who do not possess qualifications suitable for their acceptance ina trade capacity have had their names and qualifications recorded at theLocal Offices of the Ministry.     The number of such men has now reached thetotal of 11,94-9.     The Schedule of Reserved Occupations has been applied inthe case of these men&apos; and the names and particulars of all those volunteeringfor Army service who are not covered by the Schedule are now &quot;being examined by the War Office with a view to their enlistment in the Army.50.     As regards volunteers for service in a trade capacity in the armed forces, the Schedule is being applied, but to meet an urgent demand by the ParOffice a. limited number of men have been permitted to enlist in their tradecapacity, even though they come within the scope of the Schedule.     The menin question have been enlisted as dock workers, heavy lorry drivers, warehouse-men, cooks, dental mechanics, bakers and crane drivers.     It is anticipatedthat cases may arise where a man not covered by the Schedule is employed in akey position and whose immediate withdrawal from his present employment might seriously delay the completion of urgent Government contracts.     To meet suchexceptional cases, which are likely to be few in number, an arrangement has been fmade to enable any Government Department to make proposals for deferring the calling up of individual men.31.     The work of the University Joint Recruiting Boards, and the TechnicalCommittees which have been set up in conjunction with them, is proceeding aridstatistics will shortly be available showing the number of men who have been dealt with oy the Boards and the different categories into which men have beenplaced by the Technical Committees.52.     Two sets of regulations have already been made under the Act, the firstdealing with miscellaneous matters of procedure, and the second with theprevention of eva,sion by employers of their obligations regarding the rein-statement of their workers.     Regulations have also been drafted underSection 6(7) concerning the principles to be applied and the circumstances to which regard is and is not to be had on the hearing of any application forthe grant or renewal of a postponement certificate.     These draft regulationsare at the moment being examined by the three Service Departments.     Regulations Kdealing with the adjustment of contracts of service are also in draft and will bemade shortly.

H.Q.275-95 J.I.PROVISION FOR THE UNEMPLOYED MS) FOR RELIEF OP DISTRESS-Unemployment Insurciicg.33.     The position as regards the Unemployment Insurance Scheme calls forno special comment.Unemployment Assistance.34.      The number of persons applying to the Unemployment Assistance Board forallowances has fallen from about 490,000 at the end of July to 394,000 on29th September.     The &quot;Jar has created opportunities of employment forunskilled and semi-skilled workers who form the bulk of the long-term umemployed for whom the Board are responsible.Relief of Distress.35.     By the 16th September, the total number of evacuated adult applicantsto whom payments had been made (at Local Offices of the Ministry) had reached114,493.     At that date, there v/ere 63,000 cases current in which an allowance had been authorised or an application was being considered by the unemployment assistance Board, under the scheme for Prevention and Relief of Distress.     Ofthese 63,000 cases, 46,000 v/ere cases of evacuated adults and 17,000 arose fromloss of employment by reason of the war by other persons outside the ordinaryUnemployment Assistance scheme.     Further details will be found in the home security Reports.Owing to the large number of evacuated persons returning to their homesa number of the offices specially opened by the Ministry and the Eoard have nowbeen closed., but arrangements have been made for expansion should the occasionarise.(Intd.)
