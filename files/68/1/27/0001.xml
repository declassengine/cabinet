2nd report ON GOAL position for period 8th to Both September, 1959.Product ion.Amendments have &quot;been made to the Coal Selling Schemes removingcertain previsions which might have a restrictive effect cn output.Production has shewn a gradual increase each week, but is stillslightly below normal owing tc loss of man power to the Services,Civil Defence and to ether employment with higher wage rates.Supply.The rate of output has been sufficient to meet a demandsubnormal except for domestic coal and the enly shortagesreported are local ones in a few areas, principally due toccastwise shipping difficulties.     The Department1s local officers are dealing with these.Distribution.Rail deliveries are now satisfactory as also is the supply of wagons at collieries.     Distribution by sea, however, is causingdifficulties both through insufficiency of tonnage for expertcargoes, and through waste of tonnage for coastwise shipmentscaused by delay in waiting for convoys and by increased sailingtime.     Road deliveries are being considerably hampered especiallyin some areas by the impressment of vehicles by the Services.The position is to some extent temporarily safeguarded by thelarge stocks (10 tc 14 weeks&apos;  supply) held by Public utility undertakings;    and the majority of the larger industrial consumershave also agreed to build up stocks where they have not already done sc.Rationing.Local Fuel Overseers have now been appointed by all theLocal Authorities and rationing of coal will commence on1st October.   Rationing of gas and electricity operates from theconsumer&apos;s next meter reading after 7th September.

feet 5n \j jSanction has heen given to the price of coal for export &quot;being raised to the general inland price level.     The price of seabornecoal to the London River area has advanced by 3/6d per ton forincreased freight charges and 2-gd per ton for War Risks Insurance forsea voyage.     A number of applications for increases in wholesalers&apos;margins, arising out of increased costs, are under consideration, theposition being complicated by the fact that the rise in costs isalmost confined to seaborne coal which leads to difficulties in areas where seaborne and railbcrne-coal are in competition.Export.Coal export control was brought into effect with but littleinitial difficulty and inconvenience and is now operatingcomparatively smoothly.      Inland demand has not risen and asshipments to Prance have not yet reached the level anticipated,substantial quantities of coal have been available for export..     Forthis reason and also in order to avoid stoppages at the pits it hasbeen possible to grant permission to export freely.     The MinesDepartment is in constant consultation with the Ministry of economic warfare and other Departments interested in regard to the export ofcoal to certain countries and to particular consignees where closecontrol is desirable.Certain difficulties arose in connection with the continuedsupply of coal to Italy, collieries and exporters in this countrybeing unwilling tc supply coal in the absence of some assurance thatfunds would be available in the Angle-Italian Clearing Account to pay&quot;lor it.     Arrangements have now been made, after consultation withtee Treasury, for the Expert Credits Guarantee Department to cover the risks involved until the end of October.The Mines Department will be closely concerned with the negotiation of War Trade Agreements with certain countries in viewof the coal requirements of those countries.Very close contact is being maintained with the French CoalMission in this country.
