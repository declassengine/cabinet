P. !3PROPAGANDA:    AN -APPRECIATION OFACTION TAKEN AFP ITS EFFECTACTION1, Two cardinal principles have heen laid down by theMinistry for the conduct of publicity:-(1) All British publicity should be truthful and.objective.(2) Speedy and widespread dissemination of Britishnews is the best publicity.The following brief survey therefore includesobservations on both the news and the publicity functions ofthe Ministry as carried out in its various Divisions,  togetherwith any necessary comments on censorship, since the operations of censorship have a vital effect on the news and publicityservices.      This survey, though primarily concerned with theweek ended September 17th, includes some reference to the first week of the Ministry&apos;s existence.A separate Cabinet memorandum has already beensubmitted on the work of Sir Campbell Stuart&apos;s department ofthe Ministry and therefore no reference to this specialactivity is included here.2. Earlier in the period under review the News I) i vis id.found itself heavily handicapped by the lack of information fromthe    service&apos;Departments   .^mnd by the strict interpretation of the Censorship Regulations,  an interpretation at that timeinsisted on by the Service Departments.      Grave difficultieswhich had already shown themselves in the first week of theMinistry&apos;s existence,  and continued to show themselves in theearly days of the second week, have been debated at length in(1)    See War Cabinet Minutes, 17th Meeting, Item 10,

both Houses of Parliament. The principal remedial measures taken are as follows:-

(1) In accordance with pre-war censorship policy and regulations, international telephone communication was summarily brought to an end on the outbreak of war. The Cabinet have since modified this policy, subject to adequate censorship control, and telephonic communication with the following countries, Canada, France, Holland, Italy, Switzerland, U.S.A., has now been made available for Press correspondents.

(2) Arrangements have been made whereby the Post Office have released one radio transmitter for Transatlantic Press Communication.

(3) Official censors have continued to operate in the offices of the Cable Companies in order to minimise delay.

(4) Two Deputies have been appointed to assist the Chief Censor and the staff of the Censorship Division has been doubled.

(5) Three senior representatives of the Service Departments, with a similar representative of the Home Security Department, have been appointed to act in liaison with the Ministry.

(6)Lord Camrose has been appointed to be Chief Assistant to the Minister and the Controller of Press Relations.

(7)As a result of a number of conferences with representatives of the War Office and of the Commercial Photographers and Newsreel Companies a plan for the issue of permits has been elaborated and will be put into effect at an early date. Arrangements have been made for accredited photographers and representatives of the British Newsreel Companies to be attached to the British Forces Overseas.

(?) Some of these have come into effect since Sept. 17th but are included in this report for the sake of clarity.

Much, however,  still remains to he done to ensurean adequate supply of British news in neutral countries.The chief cause of the long delay in the arrival ofcabled messages which still exists appears to be one whichhas nothing to do with the Ministry, namely,  the congestion,of the cables by Government priority messages.        Thequestion how to overcome this difficulty is now beingurgently considered.In addition steps are being taken, with the goodwill and co-operation of the Service Departments,  to provide amore abundant supply of interesting news about the waractivities of Britain,  including visits of selected journal-ists to units of H.M.Forces.3.        Action as follows has been taken in the variousPublicity Divisions of the Ministry.(1) Home Publicity and Production Divisions.Regional Information Officers have now been appointed in the 12 Civil Defence Regions. Local InformationCommittees based on the organisation of the political parties are in process of formation.      In addition, prepar-ation has been made for publicity by means of wirelessbroadcasts, posters,  special work by prominent authors,  andpamphlets,-    and an advisory film &quot;What to do in Wartime&quot; hasbeen prepared by the Post Office Film Unit in conjunctionwith the Films Division of the Ministry and has been dispatched to exhibitors for showing:    a second film dealingwith Britain&apos;s preparedness for war has been completed andis now ay/waiting final examination and approval.(2) Foreign Publicity and Radio Relations Divisions.Daily telegrams reporting on the press of foreigncountries are received from all II.Li.Missions and certainConsulates.    Where it has been necessary to rebut accusationsor clear up misunderstandings, replies have been sent givingthe lines on which press statements should-.be corrected.Articles for general use abroad have been prepared and

translated.    Close contact has been maintained with the B,3.C.and has heen established with some of the Embassies andLegations in London of friendly and neutral Powers,  and with london correspondents of the press of those countries.Continual efforts have heen made to facilitate the promptdistribution of news material to foreign countries by all available channels;    in particular,  special arrangements have been made which should lead,  it is hoped,  to speedy and full service of British news in the Balkan countries and scandinavia.      Daily news bulletins are now being broadcastin French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish,Magyar, Serbo-Croat, Czech, Rumanian and Arabic.      It must,however, be admitted that German sources of news have inmany countries outstripped British sources.    With the over-coming of censorship and other difficulties here the positionis, however,  improving.(3) Empire Publicity DivisionPublicity in the Empire,  as in foreign countries,has been severely handicapped by the obstructions impedingthe flow of British news.      This Division has assisted in stimulating that flow by various means,  and in particularhas taken steps, with the help of the Radio-Relations Divis-ion, to extend the use of British official wireless news andReuters wireless service, by the press and the broadcasting authorities of the Empire,  and to preserve the rebroadcb.fting of B.B.C.  news bulletins from Daventry by oversea radio stations.    Close contact has been maintained with the B.BPC,and several special talks arranged.Contacts are being satisfactorily established withthe Dominion Ministries and bureaux of information which arebeing set up and with the Bureau of Publicity of the Sc-ern-mfint-. nf Tnflia.      Arrangements are being made for the ant&apos;

(h) U.S.A. Publicity Division.This Division has been engaged mainly in assistingAmerican press correspondents and broadcasters in transmittingtheir messages with the least delay.    Satisfactory results are being achieved, but a fuller and prompter service of news and pictures from this country is needed to overtake the leadgained in America by news and publicity from German sources.U. The Intelligence Division has organised a completesystem of liaison with all the Departments of State and withnumerous bodies outside the public service , for the supplsr ofinformation indicating trends of public opinion both at homeand abroad.    By this means matters of importance to thevarious Divisions of the Ministry are communicated to them,and questions needing administrative consideration or actionare conveyed at once to the several Departments of state concerned.    By such timely warning the growth of publicgrievances may, it is hoped, be checked.    A monitoring(or listening-in) service in a number of the principallanguages has been instituted on behalf of the IntelligenceDivision by the B.B.G. , of which a daily digest is available.This service is of importance for the purpose of enablingenemy propaganda to be countered.    A one page summary ofprincipal points is circulated daily for the War Cabinet bythe Ministry&apos;s Intelligence Division.EFFECT.5- It is too early as yet to assess the effect ofthe action taken by the Ministry in the various fieldsdescribed above.    As explained in the earlier paragraphs ofthis memorandum, a large part of the energies of the ministry have been devoted to clearing away difficulties dueprincipally to censorship and to lack of news.    As these difficulties are overcome the effect of the Ministry&apos;spublicity efforts, both in the realm of news and of longer

range publicity, should become apparent.    Already a rapidsummary survey of -the foreign press during the week 10th-17tinstant, based on telegrams received from II.M, Missions,indicates that in Prance, Brazil and Latvia, among othercountries, there have been expressions of approval of thedisplay of news from the Ministry of Information bulletins.Approval has also been expressed of the matter and reception of B.B.C. broadcasts (e.g.  in Yugoslavia).    The declarationof determination to continue the war has been well displayed&quot;in the press of Prance, Spain and Rumania.    French approvalof the united effort of the Empire has been marked.    On theother hand the delay and inadequacy of photographic material is adversely commented on in a number of countries.    Indeedgeneral further energetic measures are necessary,  since theMinistry is still faced by the fact that external news in thUnited States, in allied and neutral countries, and even tosome extent in the Dominions,  is being derived from enemysources.While broadly it must be admitted that the highlyorganised German propaganda system has proved itself very effective from all technical points of view, it may well be questioned whether the real effect has been substantial or uhave other than purely temporary results.    As in the case ofthe last war truth will be found to be the best policy.    the obvious lying indulged in by Gorman propaganda (e.g,  the fakwireless announcement of the capture of Warsaw) will reap itown reward.    In the long run, however,  it is facts that counpredominantly and will count, and the success of Britishpublicity will largely depend on our achievements in thevarious fields of war-like activity, both military, politics&apos;and economic.(Initialled)   M.21st September 1939-
