On 1st September the first steps were tak^n towards the conservation and maintenance of supplies of raw materialsiIn respect of those materials for which difficulty was feared in the early stages of a war, control organisationswere set up and a number of orders were made under theDefence Regulations giving these organisations certain powers.      Maximum prices were fixed for a wide range ofmaterials, including iron and steel, copper, lead, zinc,aluminium, timber and paper:    the prices were, in general,those ruling on the market at the time.      Arrangements havealso been made with a number of industries, such as cementand calcium carbide, for a voluntary control of prices..10, In order to conserve supplies, purchase forconsumption of some materials was prohibited or limited;provision was made, however, either by exemption of allmaterials already contracted for, or by other means, toprevent the procedure from causing any delay to workwhich was then proceeding,11, Negotiations were begun for bulk purchases on behalfof the Government of the wool clips of Australia and NewZealand, and of a large part, or the whole., of the copper,lead, zinc and aluminium output of Australia.
