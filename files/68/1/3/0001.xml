INDUSTRIAL ILLATIONS.1,     There have been no signs of unrest or of disputes on a large scale.     Therehss on the other hand been a tendency to close down small disputes and not toraise questions which would have been raised if there had been no emergency.The question of the payment or non-payment of wages for time lost as a result ofair raid warnings has come up and. is under discussion in various industries.It has aroused a considerable amount of feeling end is one of the major problemsrequiring immediate settlement.      The claims of the railway men have been referred to the Railway Staffs National Tribunal, and will be heard next week.2.     Discussions are proceeding with the T.U.C.  and with the British Employers&apos;Confederation with a view to setting up a small joint Committee with aGovernment chairman to consider major labour questions as they arise.     Asregards the means of regulating wages and conditions and of avoiding or settlingdisputes, it is at present the general view that it is not necessary oradvisable at this stage to propose any arrangements other than those provided bythe existing negotiating machinery in the various industries.CONTROL OF EMPLOYMENT BILL.3.     The Control of Employment Bill was introduced and read the first time on 5th September.     The Bill empowers the Minister of Labour to direct by Orderthat employers of any class indicated in the Order shall not without his consentengage any employee of a class indicated in the Order,4.     The Bill also provides that an employer to whom an Order applies shall not without the Minister&apos;s consent publish any advertisement directed to obtain an employee to whom the Order applies.      It is intended at the outset to apply theprovisions of the Bill to the engagement by any employer of a member of a small group of occupations in which there is already a shortage of labour;    and alsoto the engagement of aliens by any employer.5.     The further stages of the Bill have been postponed pending the conclusionof discussions with the T.U.C.  and a further meeting with them has beenarranged for Tuesday, 12th September.EHPLOYLiENT AND UNEr.!PLOYME!NT.Live Register.6- It is not yet possible to report in detail upon the effect of the outbreakof v?ar upon employment.

7.     Preliminary reports show that a good deal of unemployment has been created in some areas and in some occupations.     Luxury and entertainment trades havebeen amongst the first to suffer;    there has also been some increase in umemployment in the coalmining industry in Durham.     The Building Industry doesnot as yet show any sign of increased unemployment, but there is some evidenceof unemployment in semi-skilled and unskilled labour in the Motorcar Industry.On the whole, however, it seems that some of the newly unemployed labour isbeing   rapidly diverted to industries requiring additional labour.Firms engaged on private production.8.     There appears to be a tendency amongst a number of firms not hithertoengaged on Government work to retain their skilled labour in the hope thatGovernment contracts may be obtained.     There can be no doubt that it would bea wise policy to bring into war production as much of this idle capacity aspossible.Priorities.9.     As a rough guide to the priority which should for the present be given to demands for labour, the Employment Exchanges have been given the names of1,700 firms engaged upon essential war work.     Priority is also being given toother firms specified from time to time by the various Production Departments as occasion demands.     Provision has also been made in collaboration with theCentral Priority Department of the Ministry of Supply and the Supply departments for the notification to each Employment Exchange of the priority certificatesissued to firms in its area.Building Industry.10,    Special steps are being taken to divert unemployed building trade labour toGlascoed and Bridgend but considerable difficulty is being experienced.     Thematter is under close observation by the Building Priority Committee.      TheMinistry of Health is co-operating in measures to curtail the buildingactivities of local authorities, with a view to releasing labour for urgentGovernment work.11.    The Building Labour Priority (Official) Committee is engaged upon an urgentreview of Government programmes, in relation to the supply of both labour and materials.

&quot;Engineering Industry.12.   The agreement recently negotiated by the Engineering Employers federation and the Amalgamated Engineering Union regarding the relaxation of existingcustoms as to the employment of skilled men during the emergency period, hasnow been extended by a supplementary agreement designed to accelerate the agreed procedure in tine of war.      The central and local machinery in theindustry for operating the agreement has been set up.Dock Industry.13.   Negotiations are in progress with representatives of employers and work-people in the docks industry with a view to devising an acceptable scheme forthe transfer of dockers from one port to another to meet any shortage of local labour arising cut of the diversion   of shipping.      There is reason to believethat an agreement will be reached at an early date, before the need for any large scale transfer of dockers is likely to arise.Aliens.14.   Arrangements are being agreed with the Home Office as to the procedure forthe employment of aliens staying in this country upon whose movements no restriction is being placed on security grounds.      It is not anticipated,however, that this will have any considerable effect in remedying existingshortages.THE CENTRAL REGISTER.15.    The Central Register of persons with scientific, technical, professional,and higher administrative qualifications now contains some 90,000 names,including 7,000 scientists, 5,000 industrial chemists, 22,000 engineers,14,000 accountants, 17,000 architects and many others.     Offers of service fromqualified persons continue to be received daily.16.   All Government Departments have been instructed to have recourse to theCentral Register for the additional higher staff they may require to   meet wartime needs;    and important firms engaged on work of national defence are beinginformed of the facilities offered by the Register.17,    The expert panels set up to advise on the selection of persons from theRegister for submission to vacancies began to meet upon the outbreak of war,and are already dealing with orders in considerable numbers.      Orders for over ,000 posts, mainly for people with scientific, technical and professional qualifications are already being dealt with.

0TRAINING. &apos;18.    The Training Centres at which men are being trained, for engineering,building and other skilled occupations are being continued and extended.     Allother similar centres have been closed down.     These include the InstructionalCentres for reconditioning men, the Women&apos;s Training Centres for domestic service, the Physical Training Classes and a number of Special Schemessupported but not run by the Department.RECRUITING.19.    The machinery required for calling up men under the Armed. Forces Act is complete and can be operated as and when required.20.   Arrangements are being made to speed up the calling up of militiamen for service.     The second batch of 16,093 militiamen will be reporting to their units on 15th September.     Under the original programme for the rest of thisyear, 18,000 were to be called up on 16th October and a further 16,000 on15th November;    the War Office have now provisionally asked to be supplied with32,000 on 15th October, 35,000 early in November and 38,000 early in December,a total of 105,000, compared with the original demand for 34,000.     Over 18,000have already been medically examined and the medical examination of theremaining 87,000 is beginning on 21st September.     When these 105,000 militiamenhave been called up there will still be about 25,000 of those registered last june left to be called up in 1940.21.   Arrangements are in hand to proclaim the next age group, the 21-22 classearly in October and to register them later in the month.     They will then beavailable to be called up as soon as the supply of militiamen has been exhausted,22.   As regards the Navy and the Air Force the previous arrangements providedrespectively for 7,000 and 14,000 militiamen who had expressed preferences for those Forces to be called up in the course of twelve months.      The questionwhether these arrangements should be speeded up is at present being considered.23.   As regards volunteers, 72 Joint Recruiting Offices have been established at which men with special qualifications and experience, e.g. skilled tradesmen,are being recruited for the Armed Forces.     Medical examination of thesevolunteers is proceeding.      The names and particulars of other men who volunteerare being taken at the Employment Exchanges.     Statistics of the number of volunteers are not yet available.

24.    To enable undergraduates and resident graduates to make application forenlistment in the Armed Forces in an officer producing unit, 25 JointUniversity Boards have been established.     Joint Technical Committees have alsobeen constituted as necessary and attached to the Joint University Boards todeal with these and other applicants having defined   professional and technical qualifications.SCHEDULE OF RESERVED OCCUPATIONS.25.    This Schedule is designed to secure a balance between the demands of theServices and of essential industry by providing that in general, men in certain important occupations shall be accepted by the Forces or for whole time civil defence only if they are below the respective ages of reservation for thoseoccupations.26.   A revised Schedule, for application in war time, drafted in consultationwith the Service and other Departments, and approved by the Man Power (Technical)Committee was published on 8th September, together with an explanatory memorandum it had been in operation since the outbreak of war.27.   When special war time recruiting for the Forces began on 3rd September,officers of the Ministry were attached to the several Recruiting Centres inorder to apply the Schedule to men volunteering for service.     An importantpurpose of this arrangement is to secure that skilled men are accepted for service in the appropriate Service Trades.28.     The operation of the Schedule is being closely watched with a view to amendment where necessary.     The work has proceeded smoothly and very fewdifficulties have so far been encountered.      In view of the urgent need to recruit a limited number of dockers, warehousemen, and heavy lorry drivers inorder to bring the first four Divisions of the Field Force up to establishment,the prescribed reservation ages in these occupations have been temporarilyrelaxed until the establishment is reached.     It is not anticipated that any similar relaxation will be necessary in future.Territorial &quot;Comb Out&quot;.29.   The Ministry is co-operating with the War Office in identifying men in theTerritorial Army who belong to certain highly skilled occupations in theengineering and shipbuilding industries and are above the respective ages ofreservation.      These men if they are not already being used in a Service trade^ill be returned to civil life.

9 Q;^lJJ:ia &quot;Comb Out&quot;.30.   Militia men in occupations for which the war time reservation age is 18are being identified for return to industry.PROVISION FOR THE LTIfflPTOYED AND FOR RELIEF OF DISTRESS.31..   Both the Unemployment Insurance and the Unemployment Assistance scheme shave been simplified to meet war conditions.     It was necessary to close theClaims and Record Office at Ksw at the outbreak of war because of itsvulnerability.      The staff of some 3,COO has been almost wholly distributed among the Department&apos;s Local Offices and the important records at Kew have beenstored in safety so far as possible,32.    Procedure under Unemployment Insurance has been simplified under thepowers conferred by the Unemployment Insurance (Emergency Powers) Act, 1939,without substantially affecting the rights of insured contributors.     The Actspecifically provides that Emergency Regulations should not affect the rates ofbenefit, the rates of contribution, the Exchequer contribution, or the provisions relating to Treasury advances to the Unemployment Fund.33.    By regulations under the Unemployment Assistance (Emergency Powers)Act,  1939, the procedure for unemployment assistance appeals has been simplified.34.    The Unemployment Assistance Act has been extended, by means of regulations made under the Unemployment Assistance (Emergency Powers) Act, 1959, to certainclasses who are not ordinarily covered by the Scheme, namely (l) persons indistress as the result of their having been evacuated under the GovernmentEvacuation Scheme, (2) persons in distress by reason of the fact that, owing tothe war, they or some person on whom they are normally dependent have lost their normal means of livelihood, (3) persons in temporary distress due to delay inthe award of some other form of war-time assistance from Government Funds.The object of this extension is largely to relieve Public Assistance authorities from a burden caused by the war.35.    In order to provide facilities for the payment of allowances to personsevacuated, 950 Organising Centres and. 4,589 Subsidiary Stations were madeavailable in the reception areas, including Scotland.      There was no difficultyin obtaining pi-emises, and requisitioning powers have not been used.

56.    The number of payments of allowance made to evacuees is considerably lessthan anticipated in the majority of areas.      It is thought that a large numberof the evacuees had sufficient money to carry them over the initial period andit may be that the applications for allowance will increase.Banking arrangements.57.   With the co-operation of the Head Offices cf the principal Banksextensive emergency arrangements have been concluded for the supply of cash in large amounts at the 1,200 Local Offices of the Ministry.     By this means itis believed that any risk of a failure to neet demands for payment of benefit and allowances ha.s been obviated.(Initialled)    E.
