W.-?r Trade Negotiations and Relations with Foreign countries.      Negotiations are continuing with most of thecountries to which His Majesty&apos;s Government have proposed War Trade Agreements.      In addition to thenegotiations with the Swedish delegation, which,except for iron-ore, are going on satisfactorily,negotiations have teen opened in London with aBelgian delegation.      A provisional agreement with the icelandic Government has been signed.      Agreement onthe details of a provisional arrangement has been reached with the Greek Government, with whom an Exchange of Notesis about to take place, and also with the Danish Govern-ment,  subject in this case to an assurance about normalDanish trade with Germany, which is still underconsideration and bids fair to cause difficulties.      no progress at all has been made in the negotiations withthe Netherlands Government, whose attitude has been most unsatisfactory.      The discussions with theNorwegian delegation to negotiate a charteringagreement have also proved very disappointing.2 ,      The following&apos; is a brief statement of thesituation in each country:-SWEDEN3.      The negotiations are being continued in thesub-committees which are still discussing the detailsof the definitive War Trade Agreement.      Good andsteady progress is being made on every subject exceptIron Ore.      It is hoped, to nave a draft skeletonagreement ready early this week.NORWAY

A.      Tonnage Agreement:    The Norwegian delegation on arrival urged, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should undertake to re-insure all vessels chartered to britain,  and to replace those which may he lostduring the War.      They also asked that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should insure the ships&apos;  crews and give assurances not to interfere with Norwegian imports.On the other hand, they stated that the norwegian government could not coerce the ship-owners as tothe terms of the charter parties and rates of freight,which must he left for negotiation between the owners and the British charterers..      They have    now returnedto Norway carrying with them a note addressed to theNorv/norwegian Government embodying the terms on whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government would he    prepared to charter,and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs hasimpressed upon the Norwegian Minister that,  if progress is not made in these negotiations,  economic measures will be taken against    Norway.5-     In the meantime, no further action has beentaken with regard to a War Trade Agreement.DENMARK6.      A provisional War Trade Agreement is still being discussed.      The Danish Government are readyto proceed to an Exchange of Notes, but are anxious that His Majesty&apos;3 Government should undertake not tointerfere with trade with Germany as provided for under- their 1939 Trade Agreement and Non-AgressionPact with Germany,      The Germans are stopping all ships to the United Kingdom       f&quot;he pretext thatwhile Germany has undertaken not to interfere with trade/

trade &quot;between Denmark and trie United Kingdom, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have not reciprocated.      Allfood shipments from Denmark to the United kingdom have ceased.      The question of giving some form of temporary engagement, as required by the danish government,  on condition that Germany also respectsAnglo-Danish trade,  is under consideration.FINLAND7.      The Finnish Minister has been authorised by his Government to begin preliminary conversations with a view to agreeing a framework for a War trade agreement pending the arrival of a Finnish Mission.After the first consultation he came to the conclusionthat it would be a good, thing if his government considered the signing of a Provisional War trade agreement on the usual lines.      He has been given adraft and is communicating with his Government forfurther instructions.ICELAND8.      A Provisional War Trade Agreement was signed on the 3rd October.      A Mission to negotiate a definitive agreement is expected next week.      AnIcelandic trade mission is also going to Germany.BALTIC STATES9.      No further move has been made, but itappears that the Treaties which the Soviet Governmentare making with different Baltic States provide forthe opening of the Murmansk port and for transport facilities for goods from the Baltic States consigned to the United Kingdom-10,    Since  the seizure of neutral vessels bythe Germans  In the Baltic, consideration is being given/

given to the question whether His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should allow commodities of specialvalue to Germany to he shipped in neutral vessels to Finland and the Baltic States .NETHERLANDS11.    There were two meetings with theNetherlands delegation on Monday, October 2nd.The Netherlands delegation resolutely adhered to their view that Holland, as a neutral, was entitled to tradewith whom and to what extent she liked:    and the delegates refused to discuss any proposals whichwould limit their freedom in this respect.      Theywere left in no doubt as to what the result of this attitude would be, i , e    strict rationing.      TheNetherlands delegates have returned to The Hague to seek instructions.      If the Netherlands Governmentapprove their attitude,  it will be necessary to start rationing quickly,12,    His Majesty&apos;s Minister at The Hague hasbeen instructed -co speak firmly to the netherlands government.BELGIUM13-    The opening meeting with the Belgiandelegates took place on Tuesday, 3rd October, and five meetings of experts to discuss technical pointstook place during the next few days.      The Belgianattitude was entirely different from that of theNetherlands delegation.      The Belgian delegates were more than ready to discuss ways and means of keepingBelgian trade going,  and at the same time preventingcertain key commodities from reaching Germany.      Thedraft lists of prohibited and partially prohibitedexports/

exports were discussed at length, and a considerable measure of agreement reached.      The delegates have returned to Brussels to obtain instructions, and consider various points, and the British delegatesare doing the same.      It is expected that the Belgianswill return to London at the end of this week.SPAINlk.    Negotiations between the French and SpanishGovernments for a Commercial Agreement will begin on the 15th October at San Sebastian.PORTUGAL15.    Dr. Salazar&apos;s comments on the draft war trade Agreement have now been received.      He prefersto negotiate a comprehensive agreement rather than atemporary one and is ready to do so immediately.      Hehas raised a number of questions which are underconsideration but which,  in the opinion of HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, should not involve insuperable difficulties.ITALY16.    Discussions with Italian representativesbegan in Rome on the 6th October,  and have so far been fairly satisfactory.      The Italian representatives have hinted that they would prefer the establishmentof a standing Anglo-Italian Committee which would deal with economic  questions,  to the conclusion ofany formal agreement of which the Italian Governmentare clearly very frightened.      His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadorsupports this proposal, provided that the StandingCommittee&apos;s scope covers the whole field of Anglo-Italian commercial exchanges and relations in t imeof war.17.  Steps/

The Yugoslav Government has taken overthe output of certain copper and lead mines owned byBritish and French Companies with a view toutilising the output for barter agreements .      In one case, at least, an exchange agreement between aBritish Company and the Yugoslav National Bank hasbeen cancelled.
