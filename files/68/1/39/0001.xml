Propaganda in Enemy Countries,Report by Sir Campbell Stuart G.C.M.G., K.B.E.LEAFLETS.On the 25th, 28th, 30th September and on1st October the Royal Air Force distributedleaflets over Hamburg, Bremen and the Ruhr.On the first of these occasions they carriedNo.  EH.  155, a factual document, and on the others No. EH. 158, which contained chargesagainst the Nasi leaders of having placedmoney abroad..    The last flight reached Berlinitself.    On 2nd and 3rd October the new agency of balloon distribution from France came into action, and nearly 200,000 copies of EHo 158and EH.  280 (the Prime Minister&apos;s broadcast)were conveyed by it.    Since then the RoyalAir Force have not distributed any leaflets.There is every reason to believe thatthe accusations of EH. 158 have stung andalarmed the Nazi leaders.    The German radio

9&quot;&quot;MHI t jlfor Germany was, for instance, silent in regardto them for three days after the publicationof the chargeso    Then the reference was asbrief and veiled as possible, no names beingmentioned.    The day, however,  after the leaflets were scattered a much fuller statement was made,though Goebbels was significantly made to appearas the chief victim.    Himmler, on the otherhand, has never once been mentioned,.    It is,for these reasons, difficult to resist theconclusion that the leaflets forced disclosure.The denials have, except in one Japanese andone Luxemburg Instance, been based on Germanevidence alone.    Consecpuently it may beassumed that many Germans, though they may havebeen led to question the exactitude of thedetails, must have derived a general confirmation of their own suspicions,,    Field Marshal Goringhas since, moreover, been driven to yet anotherattach upon our leaflet propaganda, and, therefore,into a fresh advertisement of it.

9 &quot; 9k.The recent pause in leaflet distributionhas in no way checked the pace of leaflet drafting the signature of the Russo-German pact on29th September, created a new situation and itwas felt that certain of the earlier leaflets were thus rendered less effective.    They have been replaced by others either of a news-givingdescription, or comprised of quotations from&quot;Mein Kampf&quot; or Hitler&apos;a speeches so arranged that comment is almost superfluous.Experience and deduction from information received have led to an increasing brevity inthe leaflets themselves,  and to the use of vividtypography in order that any passer-by of normalsight may glean the main points of a page withouteven stooping.    In preparing them the department is assisted by translators of German origin who can lend a pungency and certainty of touch toits productions, which no Englishman, howeverexcellent his German, could hope to achieve.

It lias, of course, heen impossible toobtain in the first weeks of the war, an accurate picture of listening conditions inGermanyo    The BoBoC.  technical experts are,however, satisfied that their broadcasts toGermany can already be heard easily on the mediumwave (which is within reach of the people withthe cheaper kind of wireless sets) as far Bastas Warsaw, Prague and Vienna,  and as far south as Rome9    The same   news, which is also sent outon the short wave, can be heard much furtherafield, though it needs a more expensive set.It is understood that v/ithin the next few weeks,at most, the strength of the medium wave signalwill, be doubled, thus making listening conditionsmuch easier.Some direct evidence of German listeninghas been received^    The B*B. C. has, for example,had a little correspondence from Germans whohave crossed the border into neutral countries.

2^  46.One of these letters saia in effect - &quot;Don* t beafraia that our listening to your braoaoasts willbe suppressea.    If necessary we shall keep oursets in our cellars. &quot;   A report receive a a fewaays ago from a reliable source in Scanainaviastatea that an observer, who had just come from berlin, reported that reception of the B.B.C.broaacasts was good in Berlin, and that the Nazihoards story as broadcast had had a considerable effect.    The fact that Germans are listening hasalso been borne out by various reports from other sources.    Moreover, the German wireless for theirown home public does from time to time take uppoints made by the B.B.C.    It would scarcely belikely to do so, unless the German propagandistknew that the statements of the B.B.G. were beingheard.    It would indeed seem that there arenumbers of Germans who, whether through curiosityor dissatisfaction with their own news sources&apos;,take the risk of tuning in.    It may also be assumed

O l&quot;J ***that there is some listening nraong the troops, for there was interesting evidence of it before thewar.    Certain positive steps are now being takento ensure that fuller information in regard to german listening will be available.    As a resultof its belief in the value of broadcasting theDepartment spares no pains in ensuring that theGerman broadcasts are the best it is possible to devise and prepareo    To this end, close and constantco-operation with the B.3.C. is maintained.    Hereit may be said that in so far as its German broad-easts are concerned, the admirable machinery whichhad been so well, tested during the year preceedingthe war, has since its outbreak been functioningwith increasing smoothness and precision.The period of transition in which the B.B. C,passed from the guidance of the Foreign Office tothis Department was free from any check or awkwardinterruption, and the close contact preserved with several of the Foreign Office officials who weredirectly concerned, has ensured the continuity ithas been sought to maintain.

The immense advantage possessed bybroadcasting above all other means of propaganda,lies in the speed with which it enables the lieto be contradicted or the point to he drivenhome.      Every effort is therefore made to exploit the opportunities it presents.      It is, however,essential that the information necessary fordenial of German allegations should be madeavailable as soon as possible.

3.    GERMAN REFUGEESThe Department has been paying close attention to the possibilities of enlistingthe knowledge and even in special cases theassistance of German refugees, and hasconstituted a sub-department specially chargedwith this matter.There are,  of course, many German refugeesin this country,  of whom most could render someservice to the common cause of destroying Naziism.Some,  indeed (though to a less effective degreethan in France) are already engaged in anti-Nazipropaganda.     Unfortunately there is so far verylittle co-operation between the refugee groups which have been formed.      There is indeed amarked, inclination on their part to work inseparate and uncommunicating compartments.Consequently a considerable diffusion of effortexists.      Moreover,  certain individual refugees,eager to do something, are unable either to act alone or to find congenial colleagues of their

own race.      Some of these are in touch with british public men whose sympathy and support theyseek to win.      Thus the impression may he createdthat there are at large in this country numbers of experts who have valuable advice to offer, and yet are unable to gain acceptance for their views.It may well, however, be overlooked by those whohave not investigated the whole problem,  that theadvice of one refugee,  or even a group of refugeesmay conflict with that of others.      consequently the Department is acting in this matter with great,and it is submitted, necessary caution, and will naturally look for the guidance of the Head of theS.I.S.      It has already found and is secretlytapping the best sources of information the refugees possess,  including one most valuablelibrary.      If, however,  the most effective use isto be made of the refugees in Great Britain,co-ordination between them is essential.      Opinions,for instance, which emerged from the general bodyof Germans in this country, would obviously be of

greater weight and value, than isolated views.An attempt therefore should certainly he made tosecure regular consultations between the principalgroups, and to set up a central organization.This will, however, be a delicate,  difficult,and perhaps a prolonged process.      The greatest care must, for example, be taken in selection.One untrustworthy person carelessly includedmight do immeasurable harm.Furthermore,  the good anti-Nazi of to-daymight,  in some cases, be influenced by tomorrow&apos;sGerman successes to change his mind in regard tothe Ftlhrer.        The deep-rooted love of theGerman for his land, be he Aryan or otherwise,is one of the fundamental factors nopropagandist dare ignore.Consequently,  while the Department isprepared to make the fullest use of some wellscrutinized and selected persons,  it neitherwishes its premises to become an arena fop

German disputations, nor its policy to be diverted by sectional demands, however vocal.Nor does it conceive the fostering of Germanpolitical causes to be within its sphere.        it need scarcely be emphasized that independent andunrelated propaganda carried on by Germans fromthis country might prove a dire embarrassment,and would certainly conflict with the basic rule that propaganda to be effective must not becontradictoryc

Por the period under review, theDepartment has made pood progress in its efforts to lay lines of approach to the German peoplethrough neutral countries.    The task is naturally both extensive and delicate.    Tobegins contacts have to bo established in thosecountries which border upon the enemy.Relationships which could be easily formed in normal times are rendered difficult by thenervousness which, naturally enough; obsessesthe Governments of Germany&apos;s closer neighbours,A special sub-denartment for neutral countries is now in active being and is concerning itself with the neutral connections with Germany, whichare susceptible to employment for propaganda purposes.    It is also intended that linesleading to Germany shall.bear a return trafficof information.    Substantial results havealready been registered.    As illustrations,one very great commercial organisationestablished on the Continent has already placed^ o Ji.

90 9., , K* O 1-JlUoits resources at the department s disposal. -the name for obvious reasons cannot be mentioned,and information of high potential value hasbeen received from an important ContinentalBank.Another branch of the department sactivity is the preparation of documents for introduction into Germany by secret means.This is in the hands of an entirely separatesub-department.    Its output naturally differsin character, as in apparent origin from the propaganda disseminated by overt means.    Alarge amount of natter of this secret kind hasbeen produced and circulated.

Hi OThe Joint Anglo-French Propaganda councils functioning smoothly, and continues topromote an ever-increasing cooperation betweenthe two countries.    The French have recentlyprepared several leaflets, copies of which havebeen sent&apos;over for the DepartmentT s criticism.It is understood that they have distributedonly a few, if any, of then, and that Frenchairoraft have not so far been used for thispurpose.Advantage was taken of the presence inLondon last week of a French military delegation,to continue discussion of problems connectedwith Broadcasting In time of war, and for representatives of the Department to exchangetechnical views with the experts who accompanied the delegation.The reports */hich have been receivedcontinuously from the Department&apos;s liaison officers in Paris have been entirely satisfactory.

l6oThe French authorities are anxious &quot;that sir Campbell Stuart should 50 to Francean early date to assist them in theirpropaganda activities,, and generally toadvise upon their procedure.
