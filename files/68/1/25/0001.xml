TO BE KEPT UNrLOCK AIt is reO&apos;.!M.NO KEY.133Tg nocUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF&quot; SEES BRITTANIG MAJESTY&apos;     GOVERNMENT)sent.Copy No4f;A RC A B I N E T.Supply and Prjoductipn1st Monthly Report submitt^o^^y the First Lord of the admiralty.Shipbuilding,  Ship Repair, Conversion,, etc.In general the work in II.M. Dockyards and the yards ofcontractors working for the Admiralty is being pressed on as fast as possible without violating A.R.P. regulations.    Priority isbeing given to services which can bo completed in a comparatively short period, where necessary at the expense of services such asbattleships which have been recently laid down.Restrictions imposed on the completion of certain types of vessels, however, by the rate of production of gun mountings,tend to bo aggravated by the conditions described under SectionII below.The Programmes of New Construction up to and including that of the year 1939,  and also the War New Construction Programme,have, however, been reviewed by the Admiralty to ensure that too large a proporation of the available resources is not being putinto ships which will not be available until 1942, and also toensure that expenditure is not being incurred and labour employedori such services which might well bo used for some more immediateffar purpose;    while at the same time ensuring that adequate supplies of light craft for such purposes as anti-submarineduties, which can be produced in a short time, may be madePliable in sufficiently large numbers to meet requirements,that their production should be pressed on to the utmostextent possible./jfi,S     m   * m   m

As a result of this and previous examinations onsomewhat similar lines reductions have been made in the 1939Programme as shown below, and the War New Construction programme will be adjusted in accordance with the figures shown.+ Reductions in Programmes up to and including 1939 Programme.Cancellati ons(1)    First 2 &quot;Fiji&quot; Class Cruisers of 1939 Programmebuilding in R.N. Dockyards.(2)    4 &quot;S&quot; Class Submarines(3)    M.T.B.  Depot Ship.(4)    Hospital Ship.Retardation of Battleships.(a) LION and TEMERAIKE - Work to be suspended for a year.(b) Two 1939 Programme Battleships - Ordering to be deferred for a year.Action with gun mountings and any other requirements on whichdelay is expected will proceed,  and it is expected that thisretardation will not materially prejudice the ultimate date of completion of the ships.The- released capacity following from this retardationwill bo partly employed to lay down eight new Intermediate ClassDestroyers which will bring the number included in the War new construction Programme up to sixteen, as shown below.War New Construction Programme.Cruisers.       2 &quot;Fiji&quot; Class.

The not additional cost, after allowing for items already approved,  and. the countervailing savings arisingfrom the reductions in the 1939 Programme, is  35,008,000 +War Ships Requisitioned.The following warships building for foreign powers have been requisitioned:-(l)        6 Destroyers building for Brazil.   (Completion dates -Spring to Autumn, 1940)(2)       Motor Torpedo Boats building for various powers,(Sweden, Norway,  and Poland).    The number is still under consideration.   (Completion dates - Oct.,  1939,to August,  1940)(3)        6 Whalers building for Norway.Purchases of Warships from Abroad.In view of dollar stringency the Admiralty intends tokeep demands for purchase of Warships in the United States, or those involving other currencies in which there may be difficulties to the smallest possible extent, and for the time being it is contemplated that some ten Whalecatchers only should be built in Canada.t This figure is arrived at as follows:-Estimated cost of War Reconstruction Programme  50,258,000.LessAlready approved.(1) Second 2 &quot;Fiji&quot; Class Cruisers,  1939Programme (expedited) ...      ...      ...   5,000,000(2) 30 Patrol Vessels,  &quot;additionalneeds&quot;      ...   2,900,000.Reductions in 1939 Programme.(1) First 2 &quot;Fiji&quot; Class Cruisers . .      . 5,000,000.(2) 4 &quot;S&quot; Class Submarines ...      ...  3.,600,000*(3) Hospital Ship      . ..        ...       ...       ...      750,000.Total           15,250,000.    15,250,000Net Additional Cost.........   35,008,000

Some 700 vessels of all classes had been taken upon the 8th September.    The work of fitting them out fortheir various services (A.M.C&apos;s, A/S, M/S, etc.) is being given a very high degree of priority and is being pressed forward according to prearranged plans.    The main features atthe moment are:-(l) 50 A.M.C&apos;s have been taken up,  the first 10 of whichwill be ready (Emergency Equipment only) on the1st October.(3) 100 M/S Trawlers were requisitioned and converted inthe first 48 hours after war.(3) Some 100 A/S Trawlers have been taken up.  The first few will be ready about the 25th September.    all should be completed by the end of October.D.E.M.S.Arming of merchant ships generally is in progressat numerous ports both at home and abroad,  and is being pressed forward as rapidly as possible.On 8th September about 50 ships had been provided with defensive equipment and the number is increasing rapidly.Although given high priority progress in certain areas is unavoidably delayed to some extent by other urgentGovernment work e.g.  A/S trawlers at N.E.  Coast ports whichmust be given priority and by the general shortage of skilled labour in South Wales.Docking Facilities.The following special steps to improve the dockingposition were either taken just before the emergency or havebeen taken&apos;since.(1)    Southampton Floating Dock.    This was bought from theSouthern Railway and is now being repaired for service at Portsmouth.    This will take any ship afloat.(2)- The Sabang Floating Dock has been acquired in the dutch east Indies&apos; at a cost of 760,000 guilders 4-    and will shortly be towed to Singapore,    This will -cake destroyers and small cruisers if lightened./( 3) New4-    95,000 at the current rate of exchange.

i n 9i. ^ j(3) New Floating Deck being built by Swan Hunters.    This will cost  120,000, and should be ready in nine months.  Itwill take up to the largest new destroyers.(4) Extensions to Commercial Docks:-(a) The Gladstone Dock, Liverpool, is being fitted to take any capital ship. It will be ready in about a month.(b) The King George V Dock at Southampton is also being fitted to take any capital ship.IISupplies of Warlike and Other Stores.ArmourSupplies under the Vitkovice contract were received upto the end of August, a total of over 10,000 tons out of thetotal 12,000 tons ordered being delivered.    Arrangements arebeing made to provide the remainder from alternative sources,and it is not expected that the non-receipt of the balance underthe Vitkovice contract will have any effect on new construction.Gun Mountings.Considerable difficulties are being experienced in theproduction of gun mountings to time for the Navy, owing to thewithdrawal of key men to rejoin their Services as Reservists, orto join the Territorials.Action is being taken to increase capacity for:-(l) 4- inch H.A./L.A. Twin Mountings.(2) 4-barrelled Pom Poms.(3) Medium Mountings.Guns and /mimunition.Directions have been given for production to beincreased to the maximum possible extent.    It is being found,hov/ever, that a certain interference with output is arising from men being called up.      Arrangements are being made to provide for additional capacity for the production of shells,  cartridge casesmand fuses.    The possibility of providing additional capacity in/Australia

i 0 ,f-A. d/&apos; JCAustralia for Mines and S.C.  Cordite is being explored.Orders have been placed to meet the first year&apos;s expenditure onammunition,  torpedos, mines,  depth charges and paravanes in sofar as is necessary to ensure continuity of full productionafter allowing for the increasing delays in obtaining rawmaterials.Fire Control Gear.There is at present no margin of production to meetincreased demands for this essential equipment.    To providethis, and also as a measure of insurance in the event of anyof the three principal factories engaged on this vital work(&quot;Vickers (Craford), Elliots (Lewisham), Coventry Gauge andTool Go.   (Coventry), being put out of action,  arrangements arebeing made for the erection of a new factory at Brechin (Dundee)by the Coventry Gauge &amp; Tool Co.Naval Stores.The existing stocks have been depleted owing to theheavy calls made upon them following the measures taken inconnection with the emergency, but steps have been taken toplace orders under dormant contracts.Fleet Air Arm Stores and Spares.The deficiencies here are still causing considerable anxiety, especially in view of the heavy consumption being experienced under war conditions.Oil Fuel.Action has been taken to order from Trinidad andIran the Navy&apos;s additional requirements for oil fuel and lubricating-cating oil during the first 3 months of war, in accordance withthe Oil Board Plan, the necessary tankers being requisitioned.Arrangements arc in hand to purchase a further  quantity of1,000,000 tons from Iran and Trinidad and to requisition thenecessary tankers.Fleet Air Arm Aircraft,The Admiralty is at present considering with theAir Ministry, what special steps should be taken to improve the/III

1 m :JIllWORKSThere has been a general slowing down of works owingto the following factors:-(l)    Night work is no longer possible owing to A.R.P.regulations.(2)    The available labour has been depleted owing to- (a) the calling up of Reservists,Territorials,etc.(b) the return home of considerable numbers of irish Nationals.(3) The loss of transport requisitioned from contractors.As a result of (l) above, work is being held up on essential items such as the bomb proof cover to the oil tank atRosyth, and the dredging of the berth for the SouthamptonFloating Dock.The Admiralty is perhaps less hard hit than otherDepartments by (2) and (3) because it has its own labour forceand works organisation, but these factors are causing the slowing down of almost every contract job being performed for theAdmiralty.    All steps possible are being taken by the RegionalControllers of the Ministry of Transport to improve the pos it ionin regard to (3).Passive Defence.The passive defence of Admiralty establishments, both athome and abroad is very well forward, but action is being takento expedite outstanding requirements.The passive defence measures being taken by vitalAdmiralty contractors are being pressed on with, as fast aspossible, under Admiralty guidance.Admiralty,  S.W.3rd October,  1939.W.
