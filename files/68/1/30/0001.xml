9 4 12ND MONTHLY REPORT ON THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN GERMANYCOVERING THE PERIOD UP TO SEPTEMBER 30th,   1939-The first report,  covering the period up to 11thSeptember 1939 (W.P.(R)  (39)9) dealt of necessity only with the economic situation in Germany at the outbreakof war.    Even now it is too early to offer any finalopinions upon the effect of measures taken in the courseof the economic campaign.    It has,  however, been found possible to observe certain reactions in Germany andother countries, which are not without interest.STOCKS.Since the war started German efforts appear to havebeen directed,  as was expected,  particularly towardsobtaining further supplies of strategic raw materials suchas petroleum,  iron ore and non-ferrous metals.    But althoughit would be highly dangerous to draw any importantconclusions at this early stage,  it is neverthelesssurprising to note the apparent urgency with which Germanyseems to regard the necessity of acquiring still furtherstocks of some commodities,  notably grain,manganese andsurprisingly lead,  of which she has hitherto been estimated to hold a year7s supply or more.    This is perhaps in-sufficient evidence from which to conclude that we haverated German stocks too high.    It may be that Germanybelieves that her difficulties will increase as the warproceeds,  together with a sharp rise in world prices of rawmaterials.    It may, however,  perhaps be taken as some evidence of German doubt as to whether the U.S.S.R. willin fact be able to supply in sufficient quantities,  overland routes,  even the commodities that she could bestafford to export.

24- 2 -INTERNAL RATIONS.The food rations introduced immediately &quot;before theoutbreak of war are below the average per caput consumptionof Germany during the years 1935/38.    The largestreductions are in milk and sugar, while the bread rationis above the minimum recognised as necessary for anadequate dietary.    The ration of butter and edible fats ismarkedly below the minimum standard accepted byphysiologists,   and meat,  while not below the minimum standard considered necessary for &quot;emergency periods&quot;,is below that accepted as adequate.    The present levelof rations,  even in the case of specialised and heavyworkers,  nursing mothers and children, where additional quantitites are allowed,   is so deficient in the so-called&quot;protective foods&quot; that it cannot be long maintainedwithout serious risk to health and to moral.Measures to ration clothing, which include an order for the surrender of stores of clothing by those possessingmore than the minimum permitted, may have been designed asmuch for political as for economic purposes.    On the otherhand,  persons in Yugoslavia are receiving appeals fromfriends in the Ostmark for clothing materials, while the personnel of Diplomatic Missions in Germany are in anumber of cases already obliged to obtain,  through diplomatic channels,  foodstuffs and soap from outside thecountry.LABOUR SITUATION.Insufficient information has as yet been receivedfrom within Germany to enable us to pronounce upon theeffect of national mobilisation and war on the previouslyexisting shortage of labour.    Steps appear to have beentaken,  however,  which are shaping a new hierarchy of labour

with miners at the top followed by specialists,professionalworkers,  skilled and unskilled workers,   in that order.The higher ranks of the hierarchy will obtain,  in additionto increased wages,   special rations,   including soap and clothing,   and better air raid protection.    Nation-widepropaganda has started to popularise this new social order,which appears in some of its aspects to resemble in manyways the labour hierarchy which has evolved in theU.S.S.R.There is evidence to show that many of the youngermen trained in the Nazi system are being retained in theParty organisation instead of being called to theColours.    This may be a wise measure of precaution, but is likely to serve as an additional irritant,   increasingwith the extent of the casualties among the fighting forces.FOREIGN ASSETS.The time at our disposal has not allowed prior consulation with H.M. Treasury on the highly important question of Germany&apos;o foreign assets,  regarding which itis particularly difficult to obtain reliable information.Special investigations,   still being conducted,   suggest aminimum figure of AO million sterling and a maximum figureof 75 million sterling,   to include gold,  probably stillinside Germany,  foreign exchange balances and other assets.They do not,  however,   include the realisable value ofparticipations in business in neutral countries and other assets usually classed as long term investments.There is clear evidence of Germany&apos;s desire to obtainforeign exchange,  not only by attempting to sell merchantvessels to neutrals - a policy at present meeting with but

little success - but also by means which in a longerview would seem to be uneconomic.    There is some evidencethat Germany is exporting deficiency materials where she can obtain exchange for them,  and in some cases she seemsto have made purchases in South Eastern Europe, with aview to re-export,  to Northern European countries.FOREIGN TRADE.Other evidence of real concern about the foreign exchange position is provided by the energy with which germany is now pushing her exports to neutral countriesboth of coal and of manufactured goods,   including ironand steel goods and even war material.    Doubtless the many cases of refusal by neutral countries to sell exceptagainst payment,  in some cases payment in dollars, florinsor sterling,  and the indications of financial confusionwhich are neve-aled ..hy nrLte.ro-ept.ecL- .Wl^gr-ams-7&quot;&quot;&quot;has^.inere-asedGerman anxiety.This is particularly the case with &quot;scandinavian countries whom Germany has already notified of her readiness to export Polish coal at pre-war prices to any extent.German coal has also been offered to Portugal at reducedprices.    The fact that such exports have begun need not yet be taken too seriously,   owing to the probable existenceof considerable stocks in Gdynia, Danzig,  and else wherein Poland.    Although this conduct has impressed manybusiness men in Scandinavia,  others express doubt aboutthe fulfilment of forward contracts.    Apart from suchdirect measures to maintain her exports,  Germany appearsto be applying strong diplomatic pressure on adjacentneutral countries,   and also on the Balkan States,   tosecure increased imports from them of such supplies as theyhave available.

/ ,   ihf i\) -u-INTERNAL TRANSPORTATION.So far transport facilities appear to have stoodup well to the strain imposed on them by recent events.Communications by post,  telephone,  telegraph and railappear to be working with reasonable smoothness,   and anumber of express passenger trains are running.    Quotationsfor the carriage over German railways of passengers and goods from Belgium to Scandinavian countries are being madeat less than sea transport rates.    A new company has beenformed to open a regular service between Hamburg andScandinavian ports.  Air lines between Antwerp and Rome withBerlin have been reopened.    Nevertheless,  the whole german policy of substitute production is based upon a system of distribution so complex and so highly integrated that itsweakest point is almost certainly the internal transport system.    Key factories for the production of wartime exportcommodities will be rendered useless if the essentiallinks in the transportation system are broken,  either byhostile action or through inability to stand the great strainplaced upon them.    It may well be that future military action will increase that strain.GERMANY&apos;S ECONOMY AND THE MILITARY SITUATION.By the conquest of Poland Germany has gained what should be a relative measure of self-sufficiency in zincand possibly lead,  valuable resources of animal fodder anda considerable accretion to her reserve supplies of ediblefat and dairy produce.    Poland was also the largest breederof horses in Europe,   outside the U.S.S.R.,   and a considerableexporter.    Germany has also acquired additional manufacturing capacity in Upper Silesia and the Polish armament complexin the so-called &quot;Defence Triangle&quot;  south of Warsaw.    Thevalue of this plant depends primarily,  however,  on itspresent condition and the state of communications.    It is

understood that although much damage was done to thepolish oil fields now chiefly in Soviet hands,  little damage has been done to mines and works in Silesia andTescben other than, that incidental to the militaryoperations in those areas. In fact,  it is reported that many of the Teschen mines have already been reopened.On the other hand,  the French advance in the Saaris depriving Germany of some industrial resources not without importance.    The normal Saar coal output is,however,  only about 1h million tons per annum,  as againstthe normal Polish output,   including the Teschen fields,of over h5 million tons.    Contrariwise,  the total lossof the output of pig iron and steel from the Saar would represent a net loss in capacity to Germany of nearlymillion tons when--s^t-^agairLs-t iAaja-O-UjnpuA- .jo -EQ.land.9.    GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.The general situation appears to be one of greattechnical efficiency,  rendered as strong as pre visionand the resources available could make it.    The system is both highly complex and distinctly brittle,  with supplies of foreign exchange,  animal fats and certainindustrial raw materials as the principal sources of weakness; perhaps a greater weakness than has hitherto been realised.    Labour is being subjected to immense strainand its productivity is scarcely being maintained.    Itsmoral is weak, but on the whole the population appears stillloyal to the idea of a Greater Germany and is capable ofthose feats o&apos;f endurance common to the German character and elsewhere displayed by those who see nc avtniue ofescape.Such symptoms of disorder as have so far beenreliably reported are signs of disorganisation,   inseparable

from the onset of full war conditions, rather than thebeginnings of decay.On the other hand, we have as yet found no reasonto revise our previous view that time is in favour ofthe Allies, whose economic situation is in most waysgreatly superior to that of Germany.    Nor can it atpresent be seen how Germany can successfully overcome the increasing difficulties which she will encounterin the economic sphere.
