1n^x it m4, The number of vacant beds held in reserve for thetreatment of casualties has remained nearly constant.&quot;During the past week there has been an appreciableinflux of ordinary sick to hospitals,  and a number of Servicesick have also been admitted, but this influx has been offset&quot;by the continued setting up of new beds.5. Some complaints have been received during the weekthat patients in need of hospital treatment were being refused admission to hospital.      Accordingly on the 23rd September theMinister of Health again published a statement that patientswhose medical condition necessitated in-patient treatmentshould be immediately admitted.6. In the past fortnight the progress of the hospitalhut schemes in the London and Northern regions has been underinvestigation.      By the end of the month,  accommodation for morethan 3,000 beds will be available in huts.      Every effort isbeing made to accelerate progress.7. A first interim payment to voluntary hospitals for bedsreserved for casualties has already been made in most cases anda further payment will be made during the next week.      payments are to be made fortnightly.      The amount of this payment isbased on the number of beds which hospitals undertook to emptyby sending patients home or to other hospitals, plus the numberof additional beds which the hospitals have been asked to set up.Local Authorities are being informed that the Government will beresponsible for the additional expenditure in which they may be involved by reason of the Emergency Hospital Scheme.

1 ii JEyacuation.8. Figures furnished by local officers of the Ministryof Labour and the Unemployment Assistance Board in Scotlandsuggest that about 23 per cent,  of the 30,000 adults evacuated -had returned to their homes by the 16th September.      The LocalAuthorities in the receiving areas in England and Wales, wherethe numbers concerned are much larger, are being asked to giveparticulars of the numbers of various groups who have remained in their areas.        The results cannot be available before themiddle of October.9. The school children who have been evacuated seem to besettling down reasonably well.      Parents of school children inthe evacuating areas v/ere recently given a further chance ofregistering these children for evacuation.      Between 30,000and 40,000 children have been registered in this way in Englandand 10,000 in Scotland, and arrangements are being made inagreement with the authorities for the evacuating and receivingareas to carry out this supplementary movement.      The childrenwill be medically inspected before evacuation and the receivingauthority will be consulted as to the adequacy of accommodationbefore any parties are despatched.      The general object will beto link these relatively small parties up with their schools.Public Assistance.10. On 15th September (the latest date for which completefigures are available) allowances under the scheme for thePrevention and Relief of Distress were being paid, or were underconsideration by the Unemployment Assistance Board, in about63,000 cases,  of which 46,000 were adult evacuated persons and17,000 were miscellaneous cases of distress.      These figures

1 &quot;is how an increase of about 6,000 and 14,000 respectively over those for the preceding week.      There are later indications that the number of evacuated persons receiving allowances isfalling, but that the number of other cases continues to rise.Schools.11.        During the period under review the Board of Educationauthorised the opening in evacuation areas of training colleges,technical institutions, evening institutes and clubs, subject to various conditions designed to secure the safety of the students.In some cases schools of higher education were evacuatedto areas where corresponding educational facilities are notavailable.      The Board are endeavouring in such cases to securethe redistribution of the pupils to appropriate areas.Problems arising owing to lack of control and the absence of educational,  medical and recreational facilities in the case ofthe large number of children remaining in evacuation areas,are engaging the Board&apos;s active attention.Railways.12, The railway passenger services during the week were substantially better than at the beginning of the previous week,the railway companies having been able to add considerably to thenumber of passenger trains, particularly in suburban areas.13. Some congestion of freight traffic has been reporteddue principally to restricted lighting in yards and goods depots;as this greatly hampers working during hours of darkness,difficulties may increase as the days shorten.Docks and Harbours.14. The ports remain free from congestion apart from isolated and temporary instances.      Generally,  the East Coast is working

.; dbelow normal;    the West is normal or slightly above, with theexception of the ports used for the Field Force which are workingnearly to capacity.      Unless hostile activities intervene, thereshould not be much difficulty in accommodating the ships nowapproaching in convoys.Road Transport.15.       The postponement of petfcol rationing eased the pressure on the Ministry&apos;s offices throughout the country and facilitated.preparations for the issue of supplementary ration coupons.Emphasis has been laid for the time being on the necessity for keeping transport running, even at the cost of some economy in fuel.16.       There is pressure on vehicle resources in some areas owingto accelerated work in camps, factories and aerodromes, but noshortage of a serious character has yet been experienced in anyRegion.17.       The passenger service position is satisfactory, and atpresent it does not appear that the introduction of fuel rationingwill cause any considerable inconvenience.Evacuation Qp Government Departments.18.       Considerable progress has been made with the work of preparing for occupation as offices the premises requisitionedin the Western and North-Western Counties to provide alternative accommodation for Government Staffs.      The premises could now be occupied if necessary on an emergency basis, but much detailed work is still   needed.    to prepare the accommodation required, forthe specialised activities of Departments.
