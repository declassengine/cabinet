The Home Security War Room and the regional headquarters had previously been placed on a war basis.Regional Commissioners were formally appointed by royal warrant on 31st AugustaAir Raid Precautions Services(a) Personnel2. The mobilisation of personnel has,  on thewhole, been quite satisfactory and,  except in a few areas, nodifficulty is expected in bringing establishments up to strength.3. Some difficulties have been inevitable at the startin organising appropriate spells of duty but in the betterorganised areas there is already evidence that the A.c.p..services are settling down to a proper system.4. At the beginning of the emergency it was necessary tocall up the whole time personnel available,  and in the absenceof any call for action some appearance may have been given ofoverstrength and waste of man power, This, however, couldnot he avoided and steps are being taken to adjust the positionso far as possible by giving leave without pay (subject to recall) to volunteers who have ether work they can go to,  andto review the organisation of whole time personnel on a war

footing.(b) Equipment5. The equipment position is reasonably satisfactory.It is known that there is not enough equipment in all respects for the whole of the A.R.P. personnel, but there is sufficient equipment in all the industrial areas for a properservice to be organised.6. Distribution to the public of the babies&apos;  anti-gashelmet has already begun.      It has been confined up to thepresent to those areas where, after evacuation,  there is asufficiency of helmets for all the babies left behind, e.g.in Central and East London and Tyneside.        Completedistribution is not likely to be effected until the end ofNovember at the earliest.Shelters and Works7. Good progress is reported to have been made inthe equipment and protection of local authorities&apos;depots, posts, etc., and in the designation and preparationof public shelters.8. Difficulties with labour and transport have caused a sharp temporary decline in the rate of delivery of steel shelters.      To maintain delivery it may benecessary to accept &quot;black&quot; sheets instead of galvanisedsheets;    they give equal protection, but are liable to rust.Warning System9. The warning system has worked effectively.Certain exceptional incidents,  due to the difficulties of identification of aircraft and of sifting reports, occurred.The giving of warnings not followed by active air attack butinvolving dislocation of normal activity has given rise to

0 9some criticism.       The position is under examination betweenthe Air Staff, the Air Ministry and the Ministry of home security.        It is probable, however, that no substantial modification of the present system can be decided uponuntil experience has been gained of actual raids.Lighting.10. Lighting restrictions have developed satisfactorilyand the restrictions are being generally well obeyed.Lighting restrictions at present are comprehensive over thewhole country, but when experience has been gained of actualraids the possibility of local modifications will beconsidered.       The problem of aids to movement on the streets under black out conditions is receiving special attention.Emergency Fire Brigade Measures11. The direction to mobilise the Auxiliary fire service was issued on Friday the 1st September, and RegionalFire Brigade co-operation schemes were brought intooperation On the same date.       Efforts were immediately madeby fire authorities everywhere to get the greatest possible number of pumping units ready for immediate action in the least possible time.       As a result the Auxiliary Fire Service waseffectively mobilised, quickly, and, on the whole, smoothly.12. In some districts the fire authorities experiencedsome difficulty in maintaining the crews for their pumps.      a broadcast appeal was made to employers to spare every trainedman possible who had enrolled for whole time service, andwho was needed to make up crews for emergency fire pumps that must be kept manned for the time being,13. During the week upwards of 450 pumps of varying

O Aoilcapacities were delivered by the manufacturers to localauthorities.14.        It will be necessary to increase the number of whole time auxiliary firemen as the equipment comes forward.Casualty Services15. On Friday, 1st September, nearly 5,000 patientswere removed by road and rail from London hospitals to otherhospitals outside London, and 18,000 were moved from thelarger provincial towns.        On the same day instructions weregiven to hospitals to send home all patients fit to go home.16.        The effect of the various measures taken was to free at once some 150,000 beds in England and Wales and15,000 beds in Scotland for the reception of casualties.      Inthe next few days this number increased as the clearance of hospitals was completed and more spare beds were set up andthe net result on 8th September was that over 200,000 bedswere vacant.      Of these, some 55,000 were in the LondonRegion, 15,000 being in the County of London.17. Some 2,500 doctors have been enrolled in theEmergency Medical Service for work in casualty hospitals andthose required for whole time at the outset reported on theoutbreak of war.18. Trained and assistant nurses have joined the reserve at the rate of 200 or 300 a day during the week,with the result that some 16,600 of these nurses are available,and posted to hospitals, in addition to the ordinary nursingstaff of the hospitals.       There are also some 58,500 nursingauxiliaries in various stages of training.19. Reports from the Hospital Officers indicate thatthe first aid posts, both fixed and mobile, have in general been

duly established and equipped and that the emergencyambulances have been assembled and fitted up.20. Some shortage of extra beds, bedding, dressingsand surgical equipment has been reported from a number of places, but this is being met as rapidly as possible.21. The 34 casualty evacuation trains of which 28 are for use by civilians in England and Wales have reached theirberths and been staffed.        There is some deficiency in medical equipment, but this is being made good.      The trainscould efficiently function at any moment.      The two casualtyevacuation trains allocated to Scotland have been stationed attheir war-time depots and have been supplied with the necessarymedical and nursing personnel.Public Order22. Police reports are to the effect that the positionin Great Britain is quiet and public morale excellent.23. Following isolated attacks on British Territorialsin Belfast on the 3rd September, 45 arrests were made.       Therehas been no serious disturbance in Northern Ireland since.Evacuation24. Evacuation started on Friday,  1st September,  andin a number of towns it was completed by Saturday.      In London,where the problem was exceptionally large,  it was completed by the following Monday.        Evacuation has been extended toall those   towns for which plans were in course of preparationat the outset of the emergency as well as to those for whichplans had already been worked out.        The scheme is to becompleted with the evacuation of Jarrow, Hebburn and Sunderlandon the loth and 11th September.

25.        The arrangements for evacuation and transportwere carried out without a hitch, and the arrangements madein the receiving areas have teen marked by enterprise,efficiency and good will.26. In England the total number of persons evacuatedhas been between 1,400,000 and 1,500,000,  somewhat less than half the evacuable population.      In Scotland,  although planshad been prepared on the assumption that as many as 400,000persons might be evacuated, the total number of personsactually evacuated was only 175,000.      Arrangements are beingmade for the further registration of school children with aview to affording them another opportunity,  if possible, to be evacuated.27.        The process of assimilating this large increase of population in the receiving areas will take time and must call &apos;for tolerance and mutual understanding.28. Experience so far shows that the billeting ofunaccompanied school children has given rise to much lessdifficulty than the billeting of mothers and young children.It appears that any further evacuation movements should as faras possible avoid the evacuation of adults on the basis ofbilletingcSchools29. As soon as the decision to start evacuation was announced,  all schools in evacuation and reception areas were closed for instruction until further notice.30. On the outbreak of war,  schools in neutral areas were closed and those in evacuation areas remained closed.As the evacuation of school children had been completed by

September 3rd, a notice was issued that schools in reception areas should be reopened for instruction as soon asarrangements could be made.31.        On September 7th notice was given that schools in neutral areas might reopen for instruction on or after Monday,September 11th,  at the discretion of the local authorities.Railways32.        On 1st September the Minister of Transport took overcontrol of the principal railways and the L.P.T.B.  andconstituted the Railway Executive Committee as his agents.On 3rd September he requisitioned privately owned railway wagons for pool operation.33.        Temporary protective work on the tubes and railwaysis complete in nearly all cases.34.        A restricted time table of passenger trains has beenarranged and comes into force on 11th September.Docks and Harbours35.       As a precautionary measure, upwards of 100 british vessels due to arrive in London and other East Coast ports havebeen diverted to other ports.      This precautionary diversioncontinues, but a number of deeper draught vessels are now being allowed to proceed up the Channel until the present pressure onthe West Coast ports has been eased.36. No major difficulties have resulted from thesediversions.      The minor troubles have been due for the mostpart to temporary causes (e.g.   shortage of railway facilitiesowing to evacuation).      The position is steadily improvingas those concerned become more familiar  with and adaptthemselves to the new conditions.

try,ijffoad Transport37.        The emergency organisation has been set up.38.       The situation generally is satisfactory..       Therehave been minor local difficulties arising from theimpressment of vehicles for the armed forces and Civil defence services.        Some local shortages of vehicles for ambulanceservices have been reported.39.       Many passenger services have been reduced to winterschedules and evening services have been reduced owing to the lighting restrictions.40.        The introduction of fuel rationing on 16th Septemberwill involve adjustment of goods transport services which maycreate temporary difficulties.Evacuation of Government Departments41. Authority was given to the Office of Works on the night of Wednesday, 6th September, to requisition all premiseswhich had been earmarked for the evacuation of Government staffs.Alternative accommodation for the Houses of Parliament wasexcepted from this decision.      Requisition notices were accordingly served, and the process of clearing the premises ofall their owners and occupants was commenced.      It should benoted that nothing in the way of protection against air raidsis at present being contemplated in respect of these premises in safer areas.J. A.Home Office.12th September,  1939.
