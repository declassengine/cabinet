TpTjjJjQCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)BCREToPo  (R)  (39)  26 COPY NO ^WAR    CABINET.SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION.Civil Defence Report No,   1,Report by the Minister of Home Security for September,  1959.1.        Civil Defence supplies can conveniently be classified,under four heads:-(A) Auxiliary Pire Service(B) Air Raid Shelters(C) Air Raid Protective Equipment includingSandbags.(D) Emergency Hospital and Evacuation Supplies.(A)    AUXILIARY FIRE service- The programme provides for the supply to II.re Brigadesthroughout the country of fire-fighting equipment on a scalesufficiently large to deal with numerous and simultaneous fires,The measure of this supplementary provision represents in manycases, particularly those of the populous and vulnerable areas,an increase of 10,  15 or even 20 times the number of firefighting units maintained in peace-time;    in all,  provision has been made for some 26,000 pumps of four different types,and their complete range of ancillary gear and appliances,including a war reserve and some 1,400 pumps for service departments.3. Practically the whole of the Borough end Urbanauthorities in England and Wales who were under obligation to

submit schemes have fulfilled their obligations and about one half of the Rural authorities have also submitted schemes.The position in Scotland is that Schemes covering 90% of thepopulated areas have been submitted.4. Production of all items is now being maintained at amuch increased rate over that ruling in the early part of theyear, and the position is that about 14,500 pumps, with theirancillary gear, have been delivered.      The present rate ofproduction can probably bo maintained and it is anticipatedthat the bulk of the requirements, with the exception of one ortwo small items of gear, will be met at the end of the presentyear and the whole programme,  including reserves, met by theearly spring of 1940.5. The hose problem is difficult.      The British output is quite inadequate, and supplies have been ordered from PranceNorway,  Canada, and United States tPf America.      The Frenchsupplies have unfortunately fallen off&quot; since the outbreak ofwar, but large deliveries have been rece*dved- from America.At the moment 90$ of the requirements for PhG pumps alreadyissued have been met but this has only been achieved with the aid of the very large deliveries from America,  an  there is a danger of serious shortage if, for any reason, it should notbe possible to keep up the foreign supplies.      The matter is being closely watched.(B)    AJJOoAID SHELTERS6* Shelters fall into two classes (a) the Steel Sheltersupplied direct to the public by the Department and (b)Shelters of various types, provided by th$e local authorities,owners of factories and commercial buildinp?s*

-3-1 A 91 iJ cj(a) Steel Shelters.        The programme which provides a solution for perhaps 3 of the total shelter problem aims at the supplyof 2? million shelters and slightly more than half of this number has been delivered to householders.      The outputarranged provides for completion of the programme within sixmonths i.e. by end of March 1940, but the unforeseen heavy demands now being tabled by the Fighting Services for similarmaterial may interfere with this programme.(b) Public and private Shelters.      It is not possible to make asatisfactory estimate of the position as it stands at the endof September.        The month has been characterized by greatactivity on the part of local authorities both in the actualconstruction of shelters and in the exercise of the emergency powers delegated to them to requisition or designate suitableexisting premises.      Now that the first  rush period is over,the Department is endeavouring to estimate/ what remainsoutstanding, but there can be little doubt $here isconsiderable leeway to make up.      For these wcPrks j large supplies of Bricks, Cement and Ironwork as well  as labour are needed.      The actual requirements of these componerfts cannot beaccurately gauged by reason of the many alternatives a0.vailaDlefor the use of local authorities and in this case too it .isclear that a heavy strain will be put on supplies owing to .theheavy demands of the Fighting Services and other GovernmentDepartments.      The position is now under close examination bythe Priority Department of the Ministry  of rSupply and by SirConnop Guthrie appointed by the Prime Minister to review theposition in the Building Industry.

(0)    A IP. RAID PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT including: SANDBAGS7.        (a) Clvi11an Resp1rators.50 millions have been issued to local authorities, andeveryone in the Country aged 4 years and over has been supplied.(This is in addition to 2-g- millions v/hich have been sent overseas).        Stock is held representing a 7% reserve,  andfurther large supplies are coming in.(b) Small Children&apos;s Respirators and Babies ProtectiveHelmetsaThe position is not satisfactory,  as only 125,000 outof 850,000 required of the first item and 425,000 out of1,400,000 of the second item have so far been issued.      the weekly output is 30,000 and 40,000 respectively and steps arebeing taken to increase it,(c) Service and Civilian Duty RespiratorsRoughly 70/o of the requirements have been met.      Itis estimated that the issue will be completed by March 1940.(d) Steel.. Helmets.Over three-quarters (l-g- millions) of the Departmentalrequirements have been met,  and 400,000 supplied ijo public utilities etc.        Production capacity is available for thebalance.(e) 0joskin Garments.The Admiralty is the common source of supply for theFighting Services and Civil Defence-Quantities so far received represent roughly half the initial requirements,  and completion of those requirements hadbeen promised by March 1940o      Since the outbreak, of war,however,  the Department5 s share of production of certain articles was surrendered for four weeks to Army requirements,

9 .A fta JThe supply position is satisfactory except for one ortwo items,  the most important of which is anti-gas ointment.For this the Department is dependent on the Ministry of Supply,which supplies also to the Fighting Services.      Meanwhile localauthorities are purchasing some supplies locally.Good supplies of the main consumable items, such asbandages and dressings, are held,  and will form part of acommon pool for the use of the services maintained by thisDepartment and the Health Departments.(g) Rescue Party Equipment.The Department is responsible for supplementing thesupplies of tools and equipment possessed by local authorities.Considerable supplies of the bulk of the items havebeen despatched to local authorities, who now hold 50$ or more of their full requirements.8&apos; SANDBAGSThe position is difficult owing to the heavy demands ofthe Service Departments which has exhausted the Department&apos;sreserve..     Some 430 millions have been issued for allrequirements.        The Dundee output is inadequate to meet thepresent demands and will be progressively decreased &amp;5 demands for camouflage material increase..        Further large supplies havebeen ordered from India to cover both Civil and FightingServices, but supplies for Civil Defence will not be forthcoming before early 1940*(D) EMERGENCY HOSPITAL AND EVACUATION SUPPLIES9. (a) Beds100,000 hospital beds have been made available for air

W O Xraid casualties &quot;by the discharge of patients from hospitals and by existing vacant teds.      100,000 more are being madeavailable by &quot;crowding&quot; and by the Ministry supplying thenecessary beds.      About 90,000 of these latter have so far been supplied.      In addition,  50,000 beds are to be supplied for hutswhich are being erected adjoining existing hospitals and bedsare also required for maternity homes and for additionalisolation and general hospital accommodation to be madeavailable for evacuees.      The supply of iron bedsteads is becoming difficult and weekly deliveries are falling off.Arrangements have accordingly been made for a supply of a substitute bed made of wood with a wire mesh which can beproduced quickly.      Supplies are coming in and the deficiencieswill be met within a few weeks and a reserve created.700,000 camp beds have been ordered, mainly for evacueesbut also partly for hospital staffs.        70,000 have been delivered within a little more than a fortnight and the rateof delivery is being increased.(b) Bedding100,000 mattresses have been delivered and supplies are coming in at the rate of 1,000 a day. A reserve can soon be created.By the purchase of existing stocks,   the position of sheets,pillow cases and towels has been greatly relieved.        further orders will however be necessary.(c) BlanketsThe position of both white and coloured t?lankets for hospital services is satisfactory.      There is however a shortageof coloured blankets for evacuees.      This has been met partially

by buying up existing stocks and by gifts,f being further explored.The position is10.Drugs90$ of the supplies contracted for before the outbreakof hostilities have been delivered.      Further orders have since been placed.      The position is satisfactory.11-       Ward and Theatre Equipment (other than surgicalinstruments).Orders were placed for 250 operating theatre sets and1,500 ward sets.      Deliveries are coming in satisfactorilyexcept for one item of tourniquets.12.       Surgical InstrumentsDifficulties have been experienced in obtaining thenecessary supplies particularly as regards instruments which inthis country are largely hand forged.      These difficulties are,in the main being overcome.      The most serious problem is to obtain an adequate supply of small artery forceps estimated at between40,000 and 50,000.      In August the available stock in the country,    -2,700, were purchased and a further 15,000 have been secured byexpediting production.      From foreign sources o&quot;f supply it isanticipated that a further 12,000 will be obtained ^7 the end ofj next week.13.DressingsThe position is satisfactory having regard to the stocks held by the Ministry of Home Security which willfown a common pool.J.A.3l,d October, 1939.A
