1Survey of German propaganda during, thefirst fortnight of the War.SOURCES:The chief sources used for this survey have been:-(1)   Monitored Broadcasts from German Stations(2);   Communications intercepted &quot;by the Postal and telegraph Censor(3)    Summaries of the press in foreign capitals sent byEL&apos;.M. Embassies, Legations or Consulates(lp)   Information received, in interviews or by correspondence,from well-*disposed individuals, including a certainnumber of &quot;enemy aliens&quot;.MAIN TRENDThe main trend of German propaganda since thebeginning of war has unquestionably been anti-British.Prom the very first day its fire has been concentrated upon us.     It is true that there have been the Polishatrocity stories, but the intention of these has clearlybeen defensive, to justify the ruthlessness with whichthe Germans have prosecuted the war In Poland.      france has escaped scot-free, with an occasional expression ofpity for her as the innocent victim of British war policy.DIRECTIONS OF attack in the first few days one attack was launchedwhich had evidently been held in readiness.      This wasthe attempt to split the Franco-British alliance byasserting that France had wanted to accept Mussolini*sfinal offer of mediation,  and was dragged reluctantlyinto war, a few hours late, by Britain.For some days after this the Germans were busycounter-attacking, as the result of our use of theAthenia incident.      The tone and volume of their

1 --AI of Jutterances about tills have &quot;been evidence enough of an acute sensitiveness to American reactions.Since the &quot;Athenia&quot; noise has died down, withthe question left unsettled whether the ship was sunk, byMr. Churchill or by Lord Macmillan, the most importanttopic by far has been what is always referred to as our&quot;starvation blockade.&quot;     Whether the German radio stations have been telling; the U.S.A. and SouthAmerica about our violations, alleged or admitted, of belgian or Danish or Dutch neutrality,  or whether theyhave been talking in Afrikaans to South Africa, the themehas been the same - Britain, the bully of small nations,starving women and children,  careless of all humandecency, if she can attain her ends.      Inconsistentlyenough,  these howls of wrath have been interrupted byassertions that our blockade really does not matter very much,  since Germany can support herself.OTHER FEATURESGerman propaganda iisually lacks subtlety andis sometimes downright stupid0      Only stupidity, or perhaps gross carelessness, could account for a broad-cast on September U/th, of which the theme was &quot;poorFrance, dragged into war against her will by wickedBritain&quot; having been given in English instead of French.The stale Joke of Britain fighting to the lastFrench soldier has been reissued with &quot;Indian&quot; insteadof French.The silence of the Germans in Russian (as faras our information goes) contrasts with floods ofRussian Marxism in German,SJTLERJJ3. PERSOl^L ,POSmpHThe German WirelLess ha a been devoting somespace to the Fuehrers personal activities, stressing

liis indifference to danger.      On the other hand,photographs, have shown him visiting the wounded orwatching an attack from a carefully hidden observationpost, exactly like the Kaiser in 1914*     It may be that hitler has remembered, too late, that not every lpetitcaporal,: is a Napoleon, and that he is trying, by makingsure of the limelight, to postpone the day when he willhave to recognise, as the real ruler of Germany, the realcommander of the German armies.WHERE PROPAGANDA IS NOT NEEDED.It is unhappily true that no propaganda is -needed to persuade neutrals to make what profit theycan out of the war.     Officially, Greece isirreproachably neutral.     There is no evidence of herhaving been influenced by German propaganda, which doesnot use the Greek language in broadcasts.      But thereis a mass of evidence that Greek merchants are extremelybusy trading, or hoping to trade, with Germany.And Italy is similarly busy, though her ownbroadcasts have been in the main impartial and objective0INFERENCESCertain inferences stand out clearly.      Theyare, first,  that propaganda is effective in directproportion to its reliance upon indisputable, or atleast undisputed, facts.      The Athenia was sunk..      Thatwas a fact, and we used it.     We have instituted a blockade, and inevitably it interferes with neutrn-1.?and makes life difficult for them.      Those are facts,and the Germans are using them for all and more thanthey are worth.     Canada declared war upon GermanycThat is a fact,  and it appears to have interested andimpressed South American commentators far more than thestreams of radio invective from Germany.

Of course, if one side talks volubly and the otherremains silent,  judgment may go by default.     That is why it is regrettable that British newspapers should reachSwitzerland long after German newspapers, and in small numbers.In general, however, it remains true that opinion is little impressed by argument and less by abuse,but is mightily impressed by facts - or by what it believesto be facts.     When we have won great victories over theGerman forces, when the German people have become reallyhungry instead of being only underfed, when we have solvedthe very delicate problem of cutting off supplies toGermany and letting them through to neutrals, our propaganda will have its effect.     Similarly, If factsspeak for the Germans, or seem to do so, their propagandawill be listened to.
