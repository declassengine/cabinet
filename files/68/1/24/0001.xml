1 P 9A U &amp;PROPAGANDA in Enemy CountriesReport by Sir Campbell Stuart,  G. C.&apos; .&apos;.G. 8K.3.E.On 13th September I submitted material for a reportto the    ar Cabinet on the dissemination of enemy propagandaby air.      The following is a fuller and wider survey of theactivities of Department E.H from 3**d September to the presentdate.EARLY days the outbreak of war found the Department complete inessential personnel,  established in its country headquarters,and with sufficient sources of information for its immediateneeds.    Its war-store leaflet, although prepared long before,was appropriate to the occasion, and, being already beside the bombers detailed, to convey it, the R.A.F. were able toscatter six million copies over ITorth   estern Germany on the night of 3nd September.The Prime Minister&apos;s broadcast made the same eveningprovided an ideal sequel.      It was printed forthwith anddisseminated freely in the same gallant and effective fashion.A third leaflet which dealt specifically with the origins ofthe war was then approved by the Government and in its turnshowered upon enemy areas.The printing orders for the first three leaflets werecalculated on the possibility that they might be distributed in the normal course of air warfare as well as by specialsquadrons.      The latter, however, alone were employed.Production was therefore soon found greatly to haveexceeded the prospects of early dissemination.      Fortunately,however, the targets which had. been agreed, with the R.A.F werewidely spread and. a different series of them was assailedeach night.      Consequently, there was no risk of saturation,and it was decided (on the representation of the R.A.F.)

IPO* Ll zj-2-that, unless for a special reason,  existing stocks should hecleared before fresh leaflets were printed.      As reservesdiminished two more leaflets were issued.      Others have since been approved and are in type ready at any moment for theprinter.SUSPENDED OPERATIONSA brief pause in leaflet distribution imposed byreasons of state has been followed by a longer one, theresult of weather conditions which have been unfavourable to heavy &quot;bombers.      Inevitable though they have been, anyinterruption wa: to be regretted.      The speeches of Hitler andGoring and the drastic measures which have been taken in Germanyto prevent the reading of British leaflets,  together with other more direct evidence received, indicates that they have been inno small degree fulfilling their object, and. that even at thisearly stage propaganda is proving a sharp weapon of offensivewarfare.It was never expected that at first it would achievemore than the creation of doubts and misgivings.      It was too much to hope that it would exert a truly disintegratingeffect until there were open fissures into which its leavescould be inserted.      Its success must necessarily depend largely upon the reputation it has built for itself.      Persistence andprobably much reiteration will,  therefore, be necessary to force the truth upon other than already disaffected elements in Germany.As, however, ampler and more exact information of the reception an effect of British leaflets and broadcasts upon Germany cones to hand,  it will be possible to aim with still closer accuracy, andto hit with still greater effect.

1 0 ;f-A    -j:The Department have proved themselves adequatelyequipped both on the productive and administrative sides for the initial demands made on them.      They have organised their ownsources of information,and a series of liaisons with the Services,the Ministry of Information,  the French propaganda authorities andcertain private sources ensure a constant inflow of intelligence.They are, however, actually at a stage of expansion.      As warintensifies the means of distributing their leaflets should been larged.      It seems probable, for example,  that the r.a.f will find, itself able to disseminate them in the course of increasedwar activities, and therefore on a greater scale as well as more widely than at present.      Supplementary distribution by balloonis virtually ready to begin.      The possibilities of effectivebroadcasting are being enlarged.      The establishment of a british front in France will present immense possibilities of assailingthe morale of the German troops.      In many directions, andparticularly in those approached through neutral countries, newopenings are being found.      Furthermore, movements intended tooutflank enemy propaganda in the Pear Past have begun, and theDepartments are active in regard to them.    In addition to these demands for larger production, an increasing variety in types of propaganda will, no doubt,  be required.      The problem mayindeed be compared with en attempt to scale a huge fortress wall,when no cranny which might provide a foothold may be overlooked.??.i;tci?l:&apos;.;s of ppqpag-apdaCertain principles of enemy propaganda, well tested in tlast war, were submitted, by the embryo department and generally approved some months ago.    Since then Lord . acmillan has laiddown general rules for the direction of the Ministry^ propaganda which the Department have welcomed and,  of course, strictly observed.      In applying them they have found, after three weeksvigilance and activity,   that the following rules have beenhelpful to them:-

addressed to German mentality.Certain of the criticisms which have been passed, on the earlierleaflets have been based on English translationsof them, and. on English standards.The truecriterion is the German version.-Leaflets should, be extremely simple both inconception and expression.This is essential in view of the fact that their targets are crowdedareas of Germany in which the population isoverwhelmingly of the working class.Imitations of the Goebbels style should be avoided,  if only for the reason that the Germanpeople are weary and suspicious of it.      vhile,however, cheapness would, of course, be unworthy,humour would often sharpen a point.      The Departmentnever must forget that their leaflets are in a real sense G-overnment publications, nor that theyare, for the most part, for distribution by adistinguished fighting Service of the Crown.      Itmay be added that in drafting leaflets everyprecaution is taken to obviate risk of reprisals against members of the &quot;loyal Air Force.      In regardto this point the lorce has shown a very naturalconcern;    but a complete and satisfactory understanding with it has been reached.Personal attacks on Hitler should be avoided.    EveryGerman soldier has, for instance,  taken an oath ofloyalty to him.    The tone adopted in references tohim has,  in fact, been a reflection of that of thePri:..e MinisterJ s broadcasts and speeches.      &quot;Membersof Hitlerfs party, however, need not, it is oubmitted9enjoy the same immunity.

The appeal of F/enemy Propaganda, pending thepossibility (soon,  it is hoped to be realised)of organised regional distribution should be tothe German people as a whole.      Leaflets andbroadcasts with a sectional appeal to specificclasses and interests in Germany should be avoideduntil particular reasons for them appear.     Attempts,moreover, to foster regional divisions should,naturally, be of the most guarded kind.      interference in such domestic quarrels from without might easilyprove worse than ineffective.Direct denial of German propaganda statementsthough, of course, necessary,  is less effective than counter-attack, by facts unknown to Germanreaders.      The German press and German broadcastingare being carefully studied for opportunities ofconveying news which German censorship has concealed,or in regard to which they betray a specialsensitiveness.When possible, assertions should be supportedby quotations from well-known neutral newspapers.Attribution to such newspapers is a. particularlyvaluable method in the case of broadcasting,  owingto the care which should be taken to preserve the traditions so long and. valuably established by the B.B.C.Appeals to Western standards of morality ov todemocratic idealism carry little weight with the nazi-minded population of Germany.      Many Germansdulled by incessant propaganda have almost lost theWestern power of judging issues.      Hard, facts are,therefore, a more formidable weapon.

-s- 1879* Ihe leaflet is a very different medium of expression from a ncwsp,per article.      Forcefulnessand economy of ideas and words arc essential.      Itsfacts should indeed be    resented and its conclusionsdrawn rather after the manner of the skilfullydisplayed advertisement than of current writing.A high degree, of legibility,  insured by variationsof type is, moreover, desirable,  especially whendeliberate reading can,  in view of the penaltiesattached, rarely be expected.In regard to the above principles, it   ust beremembered that leaflets from the sky are still a noveltyin Germany.      As, however,  the novelty wears off the need for:::ore varied types of propaganda may grow.      By that time, however,both British leaflets and. broadcasting will have begun to estab-lish the reputation how. being won . for them, and to create an increasing demand for themselves.CO-OPniATIOIT &apos;7ITH PAAACEOn the outbreak of war the Anglo-French PropagandaCouncil, under the joint control of Contre-Amira1 Fernet of theConseil Gunerieur dp. la Defense kationale and myself,  cameautomatically into being.      It was the outcome of several monthsnegotiation in Paris,  conducted by -myself with the approval ofboth the Governments concerned and the warm sympathy of theBritish Service Departments.      The intention was not merely toensure effective co-ordination of Allied propaganda against enemy countries, but to enable,who   necessary, French machinery to be emplo3red in the distribution of British leaflets and the broadcasting of British material.      As a result of these discussions which took place in Paris it has been insured that allthe appropriate machir^r^  uj.   Vif &quot;hb:-oh Armed Forces will beavailable for the purposes In view.      This includes facilitiesfor dissemination of British leaflets by British aircraft andballoons;    and for the employment in certain eventualities of

They have also,  through the Council,and in collaboration with the British Air Ainistry, paidclose attention to the possibilities of joint action with aview to defeating direction-finding by enemy aeroplanes.A strong team of British technical experts is in France atthe moment, and on the point of completing these arrangements.Full and continuous co-operation with the French is secured by the presence in Paris of British Liaison Officers on mystaff, both on the operative and. editorial sides.      They arein daily touch,  through the Coi.ua.cilj.. /with all the I;s*onchauthorities concerned.leaflets in France at certain agreed, centres.in regard to29th September 1939French Aircraft and balloons for the sane purpose.
