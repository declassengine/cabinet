Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1940.SECRET. Copy No. 55W.P. (R.) (40) 113.^r^8,1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ANALYSIS OF GERMAN PROPAGANDA, MARCH 17-31, 1940.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues, for their information, an analysis of German propaganda for the period the 17th-31st March, which has beenprepared by the Department for Publicity in Enemy Countries.Foreign Office, April 8, 1940.This Analysis of German Propaganda covers the period from theI7th-31st March.The arrangement follows lines similar to those of the previous Analyses.German propaganda is divided into a number of themes intended to providea basis for comparison.Firstly, a short summary is made of the major trends of propaganda during the past fortnight.A brief description is then given of each of these. In the margin beside the items are placed percentage figures showing their comparative importancein relation to the total propaganda directed to (1) the German homepopulation; (2) Great Britain; (3) France; and (4) neutral countries. In brackets after each figure is shown the corresponding percentage for theprevious fortnight.A table is then given indicating the relative importance of these variouslines of propaganda.The most prominent events for German propaganda during the &quot;part fortnight were, in order of importance : 1. The Sylt raid (19th/20th March).2. The Scapa Flow raid (17th March).3. The Hitler-Mussolini meeting (18th March).4. The publication of the White Booh of documents found in Warsaw(29th March).. The increase in anti-French propaganda seen during the first half ofMarch has been continued. For the first time since the outbreak of warinstructions have been given to concentrate the attack upon France insteadof Great Britain.10813-7   [21116]b
The order of importance of the principal lines of propaganda duringthe past fortnight were : 1. British Weakness.2. British Brutality.3. German Strength.4. Military Operations.The most important changes in the pattern of propaganda during thepast fortnight were : (a) A marked decline in the theme of German Strength from theunusually high level of the previous fortnight.(6) A further increase in the attention paid to military topics, and adecrease in social propaganda.(c) A striking increase in the theme of British Mendacity, especiallyin propaganda for the German home population.Germany, 14Britain, 13%France, 13%Neutrals, 16&apos;V, (25%)(201%)(17%)i (20%)1. German Strength.This theme has dropped to its previous level after the unusual increase during the first fortnight in March. All aspects, except those dealing, with military strength and the support of Germany&apos;s friends, have suffered fromthis decline.The most important section, the support of Germany&apos;s friends, was concerned chiefly with the reaffirmation of the Rome-Berlin Axis at themeeting of Hitler and Mussolini. &quot; The meeting, which shattered all hopes of separating Germany from Italy, made Paris and London appear as thoughstruck by lightning. The Rome-Berlin Axis to-day stands stronger and moreadamant than ever before in its history. While the statesmen of the western powers do nothing but attempt to start new conflagrations, Hitler andMussolini were engaged in forging the fate of a new Europe.&quot; emphasis on the support of Italy was nearly five times as great as that on the supportof Russia.Propaganda dealing with the latent power of the German armed forces,which occupied second place in the theme of German Strength, was con-cerned chiefly with air power, as shown by the success of the raid on ScapaFlow and by air attacks on convoys. Naval and military strength were givenfar less prominence, apart from a series of photographs of heavy artilleryon the West Front. There was a strong undercurrent of suggestion that themilitary and diplomatic initiative now rested with Germany.German economic strength suffered severely from the general decline inthe importance of tile theme. The line taken is still Germany&apos;s immunityto the blockade and the strength of the National Socialist economy.The support of neutrals was illustrated by references to Count Teleki&apos;visit to Rome, showing the identity of interest between Germany and hungary. It was in the interest of both Germany and the Balkan Statesthat there should be peace in South-East Europe.Germany, 1A\ %(12%)Britain, 10J % (SJ%)France, 7% (S%)Neutrals, 12J%(12%)2. Military, Operations.This theme is of interest primarily to Germany and the neutrals, and only in the second place to Britain and France. The most important item isstill the destruction of merchant shipping; and nearly one-half of the topic,compared with one-third during the previous fortnight, was concerned withattacks from the air. A large part of the remainder of the theme dealt with air fighting and aerial reconnaissance.There was an interesting difference between the methods of treating the raid on Scapa Flow and the British raid on Sylt. The first was treatedmainly as a military success. The second was exploited primarily as an example of the unreliability of British communiques, and was completely&quot; killed &quot; on the first day by stories of the violation of Danish territory bythe British raiders.Land operations have been confined to reports of patrol activities.
3. Neutrals Oppose Allies.This theme has declined to its former level of importance.The main stressviolation of her terjtorpedoing of the Hugo Stinnes, against the dropping of bombs on Danishsoil during the raid on Sylt and against the machine gunning of a fishingparty by a British aeroplane.Germany, 3% (4%)s was laid upon Norwegian protests against the British Britain, 21% (4%)?ritorial waters; and upon Danish protests against the Neutraisflj^ (51%)Germany, 181%(21%)Britain, 301% (30%)France, 16% (16%)Neutrals, 201%4. British Weakness.This theme has declined in importance in propaganda for home con-sumption, especially in the press, but has remained at the same level for othercountries.The most important topics, especially in home propaganda, has beenBritish military weakness, with dissensions in the British Empire taking-second place. In propaganda to Britain and to France roughly equalemphasis was placed on all the aspects of the theme.British military weakness was illustrated by the Scapa Flow and Syltraids. The first had not only crippled the Grand Fleet but had demonstrated that no naval base was safe for the remainder. The latter was christenedan unsuccessful &quot;propaganda-flight.&quot; The suicide of Squadron LeaderBlomfield, together with the changes in the Air Command, was exploited asa symptom of the declining morale of the R.A.F. The general hopelessnessof Britain&apos;s strategic position w&amp;s emphasised by use of the Russo-Finnishpeace &quot; defeat &quot; and the Allied panic about the Brenner meeting.Empire dissensions were illustrated chiefly from India, using the riotsat Lahore, strikes and demonstrations in Calcutta and Bombay, and theCongress agitation for immediate independence. Irish discontent took second place, illustrated by I.R.A. riots in Belfast, the mutiny at Dartmoor, andMr. De Valera&apos;s Easter appeal for a LTnked Ireland.Propaganda dealing with Britain&apos;s economic weakness concentratedalmost equally upon the shipping shortage and consequent inability to main-tain imports, and on the fall of the pound sterling. This latter item hasrecently been given much more prominence.Propaganda on British social weakness has fallen heavily, especially toGermany and to Great Britain. The most prominent single items were : theinjustice of rationing; the inequitable tax burden laid upon the workers;armament profiteering; M.P. company directors; and the usual attack onthe inadequacy of the allowances made to soldiers&apos; dependents. There are signs of a gathering campaign on the subject of child crime and the depravityof English youth. This campaign coincides with signs of uneasiness aboutthe behaviour of German youth.Propaganda on British internal political weakness, directed mainly to countries outside Germany, concentrated chiefly upon the British demandfor new blood in an &quot; antique and mediocre Cabinet.&quot;5. French Weakness.The increase in this theme noticed in the previous fortnight hascontinued, and anti-French projDaganda as a whole has reached a record level.The most important section of this theme has been the internal politicaldisintegration of France, illustrated by the fall of the Daladier Government.It has been made clear that M. Reynaud has inherited all the odium that was attached to his predecessor.France&apos;s military weakness was demonstrated by the uneasiness shownat the last meeting of the Allied War Council. The low morale of the french army was illustrated by descriptions of posters held up along the western front: &quot; Don&apos;t shoot we are on the brink of revolt.&quot;Economic weakness, to which little importance was attached, wasillustrated by rationing, the fall of the franc and the plight of agriculture.6. British Brutality and Unscrupulousness.This theme has been divided between (a) Britain&apos;s injuries to neutrals; Ger(b) her desire to extend the war; and (c) her general brutality, in the propor-tions of 9:5:4.   This shows a great increase during the past fortnight in , .......  ,.,,   ,,,concentration upon the first sub-theme.Germany 54% (4%)Britain, 81% (5%)   ,France, 134%  (12%)Neutrals, 84% (74%)many, 191%(19%)(17%)Britain, 154%Neutrals, 19% (17%)[21116]b 2
The injuries inflicted by Great Britain upon neutrals have beendemonstrated by : The bombing of Denmark during the raid on Sylt, and the machine gunning of a fishing party; attacks upon harmless German freightersin Norwegians waters; the torpedoing of the Hugo Stinnes in Danish waters,which was treated as a second Cossack case; and the continual violation by-British planes of neutral territory. Comparatively little attention has been paid to damage to neutral commerce.Since the defeat of her Finnish schemes Great Britain has been repre-sented as anxious to extend the war primarily in South-East Europe; in thesecond place to Scandinavia, and in the third place to the Near East, Herintended victims are warned of the fates of the Finns, the Czechs, and theAbyssinians. Great Britain has openly proclaimed her intention of violatingneutrality whenever and wherever it suits her purpose. She intends to forceneutrals to take part in her blockade of Germany. Her immediate aim is to intercept Germany&apos;s legitimate imports of iron ore along the Norwegiancoastal route, and to establish bases in Norwegian fjords. In such a situation the whole concept of neutrality may cease to exist.Britain&apos;s general brutality was illustrated by her blood rule in India,and the massacre of demonstrators at Lahore and Calcutta; attacks onunarmed German ships and even lifeboats: sabotage by the British secret service in Rumania, and murder in Iraq; the hunger blockade of 1918; the encouragement of alcoholism among Gold Coast natives, and the brutalsuppression of the Dartmoor mutiny.As an example of the methods used to inspire hate against England,street booths in Berlin and dusseldorf have offered the public &quot;shies&quot; ateffigies of Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. Churchill and Mr. Eden. Mr. Chamberlainwas concealing his face with a Bible which, when struck, opened anddisclosed the words &quot; Barralong! Altmark!&quot; When the effigy ofMr. Churchill was struck two &quot; canards &quot; escaped from his head. when mr. Eden was struck straw escaped from his brain. A mimic ofMr. Churchill patrolled the street, smoking a large cigar and dressed inAdmiraFs uniform with a miniature water-closet on the lapel.7. French Brutality and Vnscrupulousness.Germany, 4j % (oi%) There has been no parallel in this theme to the concentration on injuryBritain, 35% (5%) to neutrals seen in the theme of British brutality. Propaganda was directedNeutrals 4f% (7?%) almost exclusively at France&apos;s desire to extend the war.   The charges weresimilar to those made against Great Britain, and the French press seems tohave been even more outspoken than the British on the need to cut off Germansupplies of oil and iron ore.There were passing references to the violation by French aeroplanes of neutral territory, and the detention of Russian, Portuguese and Brazilianships.Prance, (i% (6%)Neutrals, fvj% (:U%)8. British Lies.Germany, 10% (Si%) The general increase in this theme was especially noticeable in homeBritain, 7% (3.v%) propaganda. This increase was due, firstly, to a violent reaction against british claims concerning the raid on Sylt, and, secondly, to the Britishconcealment of the damage done at Scapa Flow. It was pointed out thatall neutral countries, together with a good many Englishmen, accepted theGerman High Command report of the raid. The Admiralty took many hours to concoct an inadequate denial. Other items of importance were the allegedultimatum to Rumania and the mutiny on the Graf Spee.Considerable play was made with *&apos; Sir John Reith&apos;s platonic hope thatBritish news would contain truth only provided that the military situationpermitted such a luxury.&quot; Attempts to attribute the machine gunning of aDanish fishing party to a camouflaged German plane were dismissed as a&quot; second A thenia case.&quot; The suicide of Squadron Leader Blomfield &quot; whileawaiting sentence for reporting invented victories in the German Bight &quot; wasfrequently quoted as an indication of the reliance to be placed on Britishcommuniques.
There has been an increase in this theme, especially in propaganda Germany, 1% (i%)directed to France.  Refutations were generally concerned with false reports \% QfJ.of conditions in Germany, atrocities in Roland, and German violation oi Neutrals, \% (1%)Norwegian waters.10. Allied War Guilt.The great increase in this theme is due entirely to the publication of Germany, 34% (i%)the German White Book of documents discovered at Warsaw, which occupied franco&apos;7* (3*)^a large proportion of German propaganda on the last two days of the month. Neutrals! 4% (1%)The object of these documents, so far as they were used to indicate Alliedwar guilt, was to prove that the Allies were planning war against Germanylong before the German entry into Prague.11. Allied War Aims.The most important illustration of the French desire to &quot;return to Germany, 1% (i%)Westphalia&quot; was the &quot;sadistic fabrication&quot; in the Lyons Republicain. xl&amp;nce&apos;i% (2%;According to this article, the Germans would become willing and obedient Neutrals, 1% (11%)only on the day when they would have to queue up in front of French fieldkitchens.   The Confidential Party &apos;&apos; Leads &apos;&apos; issued for the month of Marchshow  that  considerable  prominence  was  given  to   the   &quot;Neurosis  ofWestphalia &apos;&apos; in unreported Party meetings.12. German War A ims. -While Dr. Ley in his speech to the workers on the West Wall referred Germany^-Ji%)in his usual manner to the &quot;annihilation of England,&quot; this aspect of Franco&apos;--(1%)German war aims was carefully suppressed by German propaganda. Neutrals, i% (*%)13. Britain Exploits France.There has been a notable increase in this theme in propaganda for home Germany, 3i% (1%)consumption.   M. Reynaud, even more than M. Daladier, was represented F&apos;J^1&apos; 4^ (5$%)as the vassal and bondsman of London.   England decided that he should Neutrals, u% (i%)remain in office, though he possessed an absolute majority of one vote only.France is now governed like Canada or Egypt.   Sir John Reith directsFrench propaganda, and Mr. MacDonald has assumed control of the french colonies.In consonance with the general growth of anti-French propaganda,there is now little suggestion that France resents this domination.14. Germany has no Quarrel with France.This theme remains at its previous level of insignificance and was Germany - (-)employed only in propaganda to France. . France-&apos; 1% (1%)Neutrals,   ( )15. The Capitalist War.The true importance of this theme may be estimated by considering it Germany, i% (1%)together with the points included under German Social Strength, British Sj^&quot;&apos; h%Social Weakness and French Social Weakness. The magnitude of the compre- Neutrals \%hensive theme &apos;&apos; The Old Social Order against the New &apos;&apos; is shown in thefollowing table.    (The figures for the previous fortnight are given In brackets) : Germany 3-8 per cent. (7-5 per cent.).Britain 8-2 per cent. (13-5 per cent.).France 7-1 per cent. (5-5 per cent.).Neutrals 3-4 per cent. (5 per cent.).The general decline in this comprehensive theme has coincided with a corres-ponding increase in the importance of propaganda 011 military subjects.

Anti-Semitism.This theme is pervasive rather than an unmixed line of propaganda,Some of the points made during the current fortnight were : the machinationsof American Jewry exposed in the White Book of documents found in warsaw; the Hebrew Mandel represents Jewish and masonic interests in theFrench Cabinet; and the French press is owned by Jews and freemasons.These sixteen themes constitute the main lines of German propaganda.The following individual points, however, deserve mention : (a) There was a decrease in explicit threats to neutral countries.(b) For the first time, following the publication of the new GermanWhite Book, a share of responsibility for the war was attributed to the U.S.A., whose Ambassadors were the &quot; industriousChief Whips of the present war.&quot;(c) Attention was paid to the &quot; freedom and vigour &quot; of religious life in Germany, mainly in propaganda for the U.S.A.(d) It was suggested that Germany would help Spain to recover Moroccoand Gibraltar, and was sympathetic to the growth of Spanish seapower.Table of the Comparative Importance of German Propaganda Lines Wireless,Press and Cable Directed to Various Countries, in percentages.
