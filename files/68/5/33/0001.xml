(40) 83.WAR CABINET.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Seventh Monthly Report submitted by the Secretary of State for theColonies, covering the Period February 1-29, 1940.(Previous Report: W.P. (R.) (40) 47.)Note. -In this Report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only Colonies in the strict sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories; and&quot; Colonial Governors ,: is used to include High Commissioners and theBritish Resident, Zanzibar.Part I. General.1. Utilisation of Colonial Man-Power.IT was stated in the report for January that plans for the formation of aCyprus regiment were nearing completion. Formal approval has now been givenfor the formation of this regiment, which will consist of a combatant battalion,pioneer companies and pack transport companies. Units of the first two categories are being raised forthwith, and the pack transport unit which isalready in France will be absorbed as part of the regiment. Commissions will begranted through the Army Officers&apos; Emergency Reserve, and all enlistments willbe for the duration of the war.   This decision has been received with great ,satisfaction in the Colony, and the recruiting offices have been besieged with state&apos;s&apos;Japplicants. telegrams Nos.A Pioneer Unit from Palestine composed -jointly of Jews and Arabs has now i8,an3 ^ ofj *    *pi Kcb. 9, 1940,arrived in i ranee. .mcl Prcss2. Censorship. Reports.Reference was made in the January report to the censorship at Bermuda of mails carried by the United States Clipper Service.  Towards the end of Februaryarticles appeared in the Press alleging that the first examination undertaken (orthe 18th January) had been carried out with armed force.  This was categorically telegram sdenied by the Government of Bermuda, and the denial was published in the Press. No. n of relations were of the best and the whole operation was carried out in the most Poh- 23, 19iatactful manner.   Nevertheless, it has since been reported in the Press (though there is at present no official confirmation of this report) that the operating  ,,ess rei,olts-Company has decided to discontinue the call of the Clipper Service at Bermuda onits eastward-bound flight.   Censorship is not suggested in the Press report as a reason for this decision.  On the other hand, however, there have also been press reports which suggest that, in view of the weather conditions prevailing at the azores, the Air Company concerned contemplate direct flight between Bermudaand Lisbon, omitting the call at the Azores.3. White Paper on Development Policy.An important statement of policy on Colonial development and welfare was published on the 27th February (Cmd. 6175).  The statement of policy, in additionto announcing that the Government intended to give effect to the most important[20953] p
of the West India Royal Commission^ recommendations (for the appointment ofa Comptroller of Welfare for the West Indies to be supplied with funds by the,United Kingdom Government) which were published simultaneously, announced the provision of assistance up to  5 million a year for Colonial development and welfare and  500.000 a year for research. The statement of policy has had avery good reception in this country and in the Colonial Dependencies. Fullreports as to its reception in America and in neutral and Allied foreign countries are not yet available, but such reports as have been received indicate that aconsiderable impression has been made by the statement of policy being announced in time of war. The legislation which will have to be introduced this Session to implement this policy is now being prepared, and careful consideration is being given to other preliminary action which will be necessary.4. Econ.07n.ic Measures.(i) Exchange Control. There is no particular development to report. Thescheme for obtaining control of the foreign exchange proceeds of sales of tin andrubber abroad is now complete, and it will probably be introduced during March.(ii) Export Licensing. The question of the extent to which applications for colonial export licences should be submitted to the Colonial Office by colonial governments before approval is still under active consideration, but so manyfactors are involved that it is unlikely that an early decision will be come to.For the moment attention is being focussed on speeding up the scheme asinstituted at present.The embargo on Colonial exports to Roumania has been lifted. In the caseof Palestine, it was in fact never imposed as the export trade in citrus fruit was so precarious that to check it. even temporarily in Roumania, might have hadmost undesirable repercussions.(iii) Import Licensing. The Colonial Office took part in the discussions withthe French Delegation which was over here in February, and agreement wasreached on the principles which the two Governments should adopt in the matterof the licensing of imports from the other country into the French and british colonial Empires respectively. Instructions have not as yet been sent out toColonial Governments as a result of this Agreement as several difficult pointshave arisen, for instance, the question of the desirability of not treating Frenchimports more favourably than Canadian imports, especially in such areas as theWest Indies, where there are particularly close commercial ties with Canada.By special arrangement with the French, the Agreement will not in any caseapply at present to Palestine and the territories lying in the Conventional Basinof the Congo on the one hand, or to Syria and the Lebanon and Morocco onthe other.(iv) Supplies of Colonial Products to the United Kingdom and France. the marketing of the main Colonial primary products which are essential for theAllied war effort has continued satisfactorily during the month; but difficultiesremain in the case of those products which are not vitally necessary to the Allies,and for which either markets or, more commonly, adequate shipping space arelacking because of the war. For example, the economic stability of the dependencies in the South Seas, which depend very&apos; largely on the coconutindustry, is likely to be severely upset unless provision can be made for liftingtheir copra output.Agricultural delegations arrived at the end of February from Tanganyikaand from Kenya and Uganda to discuss, with the Colonial Office and the otherDepartments concerned, certain problems relating to the marketing of east african agricultural products under war conditions; discussions are proceeding satisfactorily.The French Government asked whether supplies of coffee would be available from the British Empire for France this year. It was understood that, for reasons connected with their commercial relations with Brazil, the French were anxiousto reduce their imports of coffee from that country. The French Government^enquiry was communicated to the Governors of the coffee-producing Colonies,namely, the East African dependencies and Jamaica, and replies have now beenreceived from them. Unfortunately, it appears that in none of the Coloniesconcerned are large quantities likely to be. available, the East African depen-tendencies in particular having suffered from a very bad season this year.   The
position is, however, being considered in consultation with the Chairman of theCoffee Board of Kenya, who is now in this country, and it is hoped shortly tosubmit proposals in answer to the French enquiry.(v) Shipping. Shipping difficulties remain in the forefront of the economic problems which beset the Colonies to-day. As the War Cabinet will, of course,be aware, these difficulties are at present increasing rather than diminishing, andi! seems likely that their full force has not yet been felt in the Colonial Empire.I; may well be that, before the war is over, Colonies will have to face a drastic,iIteration of their normal channels of trade with a view to selling as much aspossible close at hand. Particular export trades are already under examinationfrom this point of view, the most notable being the trade in sugar, which is atpresent under examination in the Colonial Office, in consultation with otherDepartments of Government concerned, with a view to securing further savings in both foreign purchases of sugar and long shipping hauls. One project -whichis now under examination is that of meeting the requirements of the EasternColonies of Hong Kong, Malaya and Ceylon, which are heavy sugar consumers,from Queensland, Fiji and Mauritius, with a view to displacing the imports which those consuming Colonies at present draw from Java. Another trade which is being examined from the same point of view is the Western Pacific copratrade referred to in Section (4) above.At the present moment the two areas in the Colonial Empire which are suffering most acutely from shipping difficulties are East Africa, referred to inmy last month&apos;s Report, and the Western Pacific Islands, just mentioned.I am very glad to be able to report that the greater part of the limitedquantity of oranges and grapefruit, at the export of which the Palestineauthorities were aiming this season, has now been either shipped or fixed for shipping. The reduced programme comprised the export of about 7\ millioneases (as compared with some 13 million cases last year), and of this programmeshipping has been definitely arranged for some 6 million cases. I am glad to acknowledge again the assistance which the Minister of Shipping has given tohelp enable this result to be achieved. The political importance of securing atleast a reasonable proportion of Palestine citrus exports needs no emphasis.(vi) Supply of Foodstuffs to tlie Colonies. No serious difficulties have beenreported under this head, but there is reason to believe that there may be difficultyin the future in maintaining our exports of condensed milk to the Colonies, and,in view of the proposed increase in the prices paid to United Kingdom milkproducers, in preventing a heavy increase in the price of these exports. condensed milk is an important article in the diet of the indigenous population of many ofthe tropical dependencies, particularly Malaya.Part II.- Particular Colonies.5. Kenya.The Report of the Commission of Inquiry which was appointed in August1939 to investigate the causes of the strike at Mombasa has now been received,and is under consideration. The Report (which has already been published bythe Government of Kenya) is critical of the housing arrangements for Africanlabourers employed at the Port; and amongst its recommendations is one for the strengthening of the Labour Department, which has already been accepted bythe Governor.The Colony is suffering from the effects of one of the worst droughts Kenyaexperienced in recent years, which has just been brought to an end by torrential ^e0spj^frains.   Grazing and crops in the coastal and low-lying areas are particularly       i5Oi940aiiected, but thanks to a previously initiated long-range policy, the situation iswell in hand.6. Somaliland.Gracing Rights.On the 27th January, 1937, an agreement (by exchange of letters) was signed by Signor Cerulli, on behalf of the Italian Government, and Mr. CliffordPlowman, on behalf of the Government of British Somaliland, under Avhich theBritish Somali tribes were given access to their traditional grazing groundsm Ethiopia for a period of two years from the 1st March, 1937. The agreement[20953] B 2
was extended for a period of six months from the 1st March, 1939, and extended for a further period of six months from the 1st September, 1939. His Majesty&apos;s foreign Office Ambassador at Rome has been asked in a despatch dated the 20th February, 1940.kviaVof to request the Italian Government to agree to a further extension of the agree-Kci.. 20, 1940. ment. An extension for two years is desired, but the period for which the ItaliantQ S&apos;.r Porc.v    Government should be asked to prolong the agreement has been left to the discretion of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador.   The result of the approach to theItalian Government is not yet known.Disarmament of the Somali Tribes.At their 366th meeting held on the 20th July. 1939, the Committee ofImperial Defence agreed to approve the proposal of the Oversea DefenceCommittee that disarmament of the Somali tribes should be carried out on acompensation basis, compensation being paid only for registered arms.secret&quot;0&apos; S A -scent report from the Governor shows that registered rifles, for whichdespatch of     compensation is being paid, are coming in freely, and up to the end of NovemberDec. 22, 1939.   a total of 1,132 registered rifles had been redeemed out of an estimated total of1,972.  The calling in of unregistered arms, of which it is estimated that there are about 5,000 in the Protectorate and for which no compensation is to be paid, wasto commence early in February 1940.   This may be regarded as the testing timeSecretary 0f    for the Governor&apos;s disarmament programme, and he has been asked to submitdespatciTofet   aT! mterim report on the reaction of the tribes to the calling in of unregisteredFeb.&apos;g, 1940.    rifles as soon as sufficient time has elapsed to allow him to judge of the position.7. West Indies.The War Cabinet decided at its meeting on Thursday, the 15th February(W.M. (40) 42nd Conclusion, Minute 1), in favour of the publication of a State-nient of Recommendations prepared by the members of the Commission them-selves. This was published as Cmd. 6174 on Tuesday, the 20th February,simultaneously with the White Paper on Colonial Development and Welfare(Cmd. 6175). Owing, no doubt, to the fact that the White Paper accepted forth-with certain of the major recommendations of the Commission and promisedfavourable consideration of the remainder, the recommendations have been extremely well received throughout the West Indies, only a very occasional voicehaving been raised in criticism of the non-publication of the Report in full.Steps are being taken with a view to the appointment at an early date ofa Comptroller of the West Indian Welfare Fund and an Inspector-General ofAgriculture.Employment of West Indian seamen in the Merchant Service.The question of employing additional seamen from the British West Indiesin the Merchant Service to meet shortages in that Service is under discussion withthe Ministry of Shipping. The total number of seamen available in the british west Indies is estimated at about 1,800.British Honduras.The Guatemalan Government has replied to the proposals referred to in myreport for January. They have accepted the proposal for arbitration, but haverejected the proposed terms of reference, and have revived their claim for a cession of territory.... 8. Far East.&apos;        Ceylon.Governor^ On the 27th February the Board of Ministers in Ceylon resigned on theNo^P1&quot;1        occasion of a disagreement with the Governor owing to his supporting the PoliceFeb. 27 &quot;mo.   authority in their inability to comply fully with a request from the Minister ofHome Affairs that criminal prosecutions against alleged ringleaders in an estateriot should be postponed pending the Report of a Commission of Enquiry, whichwas to be appointed to investigate the circumstances of the riot.There were indications in the ensuing days that the State Council and thelate Ministers might be determined upon. a policy of non co-operation, butaccording to the latest report from the Governor it appears more likely that theMinisters will agree to resume their functions.
Malaya.The Federal Council of the Federated Malay States on the 20th Februaryadopted a resolution voting a sum of  1 million as a contribution to His Majesty^Government for the prosecution of the war. The High Commissioner has sub-sequently reported the intention of the Rajah of the small Unfederated MalayState of Perils to offer $50,000 (about  5,800) as a war contribution from hisState.9. Palestine.During February security conditions continued to improve. Arab and Jewishrelations are now open and outwardly normal and there has been a tendency onthe part of the Arabs to revert to the wearing of the Tarboush. There was littlepolitical activity during the month in either community and the return of three members of the former Arab Higher Committee passed practically unnoticed.Arab opinion was, however, perturbed over the continued influx of Jewishillegal immigrants and there was also growing Arab criticism over the delay in implementing that part of the White Paper policy which relates to the controlof the sale of land. The Jews, on the other hand, were confident that legislation would not be enforced; negotiations for further purchases of Arab land wereprosecuted energetically and, in the present economic circumstances, Arabs wereentertaining such propositions. The publication of the Land Transfers Regu-lations on the 28th February therefore surprised Arabs and Jews alike. TheHigh Commissioner reports that this action has proved the best possible retortto German wireless propaganda disci-editing the honesty of British intentions.The Arabs, and especially the villagers, were pleased and relieved, though notdemonstratively so. They feel that the publication of the regulations is evidenceof the Governments determination to implement the White Paper, and that itis a proof of British sincerity, which encourages constructively-minded Arabs,whose efforts in support of Government will no longer be nullified by the tauntsof those who say that Government makes promises but never fulfils them. TheArab press has given the regulations a cordial reception, and warm expressions of appreciation have been received from the Amir Abdullah and from the Mayorof Nablus, who is a prominent moderate leader.The Jews, on the other hand, were offended and angry. Demonstrationstook place in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa, and it became necessary to impose a curfew at the two latter towns. By the morning of the 3rd March the situation was again quiet. Up to that time, 14 British and one Palestinian police, andtwo soldiers had been injured, though not seriously. 212 Jews had beenslightly injured, 35 more seriously, and 2 were dangerously injured, one ofwhom has since died. About 500 arrests had been made, mostly of curfewbreakers in Tel Aviv. The High Commissioner reports that Jewish opinionplaces great expectations in the House of Commons, and that it hopes to securethe vote not only of the Labour Party, but also of other members.The economic situation has improved, mainly on account of military works in connection with the arrival of troops. As a result, unemployment hasdecreased. Disputes and friction are, however, still rife between the Jewishlabour organisations, and instances have occurred of minor clashes with violencewhich have necessitated police intervention. Improved shipping facilities andthe rise of prices in England have somewhat relieved the citrus industry for themoment, but the general situation of the citrus grower is still critical. arab and Jewish growers have co-operated in submitting representations to HisMajesty&apos;s Government for assistance to the industry.The situation in Trans-Jordan is normal.M.
