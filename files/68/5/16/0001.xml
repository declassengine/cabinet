The Master of the Rolls has returned to London toreport on the new situation created by Signor Mussoliiti&apos; s refusal to permit the supply of armaments to this country.15.

Widedifferences were noted between Hungary&apos;s former imports and her present requirements.17. After negotiations it was decided that in the case ofcotton,  Count Almaszy would submit to his Government a figureof 13,000 tons as an import quota to cover the first rationingperiod from the 15th. December to the 31st May.18. In the case of copper the import quota required was further in excess of previous imports,    In this instance it wasagreed that,  subject to the views of the French Government,a figure of 9,350 tons for the first quota should be submittedto the Hungarian Government,    It was also agreed that the hungarian Authorities should furnish His Majesty&apos;s Legation withany information that might be required to show that theadditional/

It appears that their wheat purchases from Roumania,Prance and the Argentine will fall short of requirements by300,UOO tons, and that the shortage of bread in the country districts is causing acute anxiety,,     The proposal is beingconsidered^,22. II.M, Ambassador has reported fully on the contrabandactivities by sea and air between Spain and Germany via Italy.Vve have known for some time that valuable German goods werereaching Spain by air.      It is now clear that the volume goingin this way is considerable and. that the air lines serve Portugalalso.      The Ambassador points out that a tightening up of theFrench naval, contraband control should be urged, but that unlessaircraft can also be submitted to control,  the sea control will only have the effect of increasing the amount of goods sent by air.     Zn addition to the American and Italian services now inoperation, it is proposed to institute a German service between italy and SpainsPORTUGAL23.

Ambassadoris being requested to point out to the Portuguese Governmentthat any agreed Limitation of Portuguese Exports which was notenforced by the Portuguese Government would be of little value to us;    that we regret that the Portiiguese Government have not felt able to assist us on the lines we had suggested, and that&quot;,in the circumstances,  it seems best that matters should remain as they are for the present02ht, The question of introducing the navicert system forPortuguese exports,  as suggested by HVM. ambassador, is being examined 0-OHINa25- The Chinese Government&apos;s reply has now been received tothe questions which His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Chungking was instructed, to put to them with regard to their barter arrangements with Soviet Russia,  and more particularly with regard to the cargo of v?oifpam, antimony and tin on board the Soviet vessel&quot;Selenga&quot; at Hong kong      The information furnished by theChinese Government is not a complete answer ta the questionswhich, were put to them,  though they state that they will bepleased to examine proposals fox- regulating the export of certainraw materials from China to Russia, provided that the proposals will not obstruct the practical working of the barter agreementwith the Sovieto      In view of the incomplete nature of theChinese Government&apos;s reply, the &quot;Solenga&quot; has not yet been released. 0Oontrabaad^A^eementa \ri_th. firms and -fither.general Prize questions,26o Since the begj.nn.ing of IQUu,, arrangements have been madewith, or general assurances received from a number of importantfirmso     These firms include: Messrs0 Francesco Parisi,  the

leading Italian forwarding agents, the Hungarian Cotton.

The latter agreement, madewith a combine which normally controls 80 - 90% of the Dutchimports of. freah fruits, contains specific import quotas and isexpected to have the effect of rationing Dutch imports of freshfruit, and of preventing the normal export of fruit from Hollandto Germany,29, There appears to be an increased tendency on the part oftraders to wish to come to an understanding with the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare,      This applies to exporters as well as importers.a considerable number of negotiations have been recently startedwith the approval and collaboration of ether Departments inter-ested and will, it is hoped, result in Agreements.     Among the firms concerned are Messrs, Armour &amp; Co,, and Messrs, swift &amp; Co.30.  IN/

30 o In the-aaucse- -of&quot;-the JL&amp;s t -w-eeKI the-jJ^mtraJband\^.G*ffl^, has. considered a number of questions of general scope.(a) The requirement, hitherto imposed on shippers in theinterest of contraband control, of specifying the name of theconsignee on the bill of lading, is held to be detrimental toBritish mercantile and financial interests and to impose incertain cases an unnecessary restriction on innocent neutraltradeo     An attempt has accordingly been made to devise a schemewhereby goods may be consigned to a bank in the country of dest-ination which will have agreed to hold them at the instructions of the Ministry of Economic Warfare.(b) a plan for carrying on the work of Contraband control in the event of a breakdown of communications between the Ministryof iUconomic warfare and the UontrabandLjJontrol Bases and portswas tentatively approved^by-the^Oommittee.     Certainfunctionsnow performed in the Ministry of iiiconomic Warfare will,  in the contemplated emergency, be performed by Naval and Customsauthorities at United Kingdom bases and ports respectively, andin the Mediterranean area, by the Anglo-French Committee in Home.(c) Arrangements for dealing with contraband found in mailshave been improvede      Customs are now empowered to seize notmerely, as hitherto, contraband addressed to Germany by parcelpost, but financial contraband addressed to adjacent neutralswill henceforth be reported to the Ministry of Economic warfare and considered by the Prize Department.     as for letter mailaddressed to adjacent neutrals the Censorship authorities willhave the responsibility of reporting to the Ministry of economic warfare any contents suspected of being contraband,. CONTRABAND CONTROL31o During the week ending 17th February,  89 new cases ofships were dealt with and 38 previous cases,  in regard to whosecargoes or items thereof enquiries had been completed, were disposed of032. In 68 cases entire cargoes were released, either on first/

first- consideration or after, enquiries,33. The system under which advance, copies., ofL. manifestsof cargoes are received and considered before the ships arrival at ports in this country resulted, during the week under review,in 54 cases being so dealt with and in 42 cases of the shipsconcerned being released by the Committee subject merely -to the formal checking of the original manifests on their arrival atthe control Bases,     In addition to these immediate releases,in 12 other cases the Committee&apos;s decision to release was given within 3 days or less of the arrival of ships at the control bases.     Of ships released 27 sailed under Hold-Back Guarantees.Navicerts34. Since the introduction of the Navicert system 22,784applications for navicerts have been received up to the 17thFebruary,     Of these 17*934 have been granted and 816 refused,while 3*467 are pending or have not yet been presented forconsideration,*  work of the Enemy Exports Committee35* The Committee met six times this week.     It reviewed 12ships, releasing 3, detaining 4 for enquiries, and orderingitems of cargo from 5 to be discharged and placed in Prize,36, The Committee considered 377 specific applications for exemption, granting 152, refusing 220 and deferring considerationof 5,     In addition 216 applications were treated summarily, 26being granted, and 187 refused,37, Applications of a general character were submitted tothe Committee in respect of (l) so-called &quot;typical&quot; Italiangoods, (2) a mass of claims to exemption supported by theJapanese Embassy, (3) a time-limit for Italian claims,(l)   The object of this curious application was presumablyto avoid the necessity for certificates of origin for Italianexports.     The &quot;typical&quot; Italian goods ranged from mineral waters and cheeses through textile and vegetable oils to sulphur andcement;/

cement; and. the Committee felt that, once a portmanteau-exemptionwas granted to one country, the bottom wovQ.d very soon be knockedout of our control.      The application was accordingly refused,(2)   The hatch of applications submitted by the JapaneseEmbassy numbered 152; and the particulars submitted were sounsatisfactory that the Committee would not have hesitated to reject the applications with hardly an exception if they had come forward from private traders,      as it was thought that political considerations might be involved, the committee recommended exemption for a very few applications that were somewhat less objectionable than the rest and directed that,subject to the approval of the Foreign office, nearly a hundredothers should be referred to the Japanese Ambassador with a request that he should obtain further information, especiallyevidence of payment,(3)   The Italian members of the Anglo-Italian Standing Committeein Home had asked for a fortnight!s notice of the latest date bywhich applications for exemption would be received.      The Committeesuggested they should be informed that applications would onlybe considered if received not later than 1st March.
