In the margin beside the items are placed percentage figures showing their comparativeimportance in relation to the total propaganda directed to (1) the Germanhome population; (2) Great Britain; (3) France; and (4) neutral countries.In brackets after each figure is shown the corresponding percentage for theprevious fortnight.A table is then given indicating the relative importance of these variouslines of propaganda.The most important events during the past fortnight, for german propaganda, were: 1. The Russo-Finnish peace, signed on the 12th March.2. The visit of Herr von Ribbentrop to Rome on the 10th March.3. The Leipzig Fair, opened by Dr. Goebbels on the 3rd March.By far the most important of these events was the signing of the Russo-Finnish peace treaty, which occupied more than a third of all german propaganda during the last four days of the fortnight.10813-6   [21024] b
The following table gives the percentage of the total of German wirelesspropaganda devoted to the peace negotiations and to the treaty during thesecond half of the period under review : &apos;To To To ToGermany.

British weakness.2. German strength.3. British brutality.4. Military operations.1. German Strength.Germany, 25% ^ There has been a striking increase of over 50 per cent, in the theme of britain 20i% (ill) German strength. Every aspect save that of social strength has contributedFrance,&apos; 17% (11%)   to this extraordinary increase.Neutrals, 20%    ^ Roughly equal importance was attached to Germany&apos;s economic strength,(I4i%) tQ jjgj, internal political unity and to the support of her friends.The Leipzig Fair was used as a text for propaganda illustrating thenormality of German economy and of Germany&apos;s relations with the neutrals,especially Avith the Balkans. The fair was another &quot;final proof&quot; of thefailure of the Allied blockade. Some attention was also given to the Italo-German coal agreement. There was comparatively little mention of economic assistance from Russia.The most important single item in the theme of German strength wasRibbentrop&apos;s visit to Rome, used to demonstrate the unshakability of the axis. Italo-German cultural exchanges reinforced the point. The supportof Italy during the current fortnight has completely overshadowed assistancefrom Russia.The anniversaries of the annexation of Austria and of Bohemia andMoravia were the occasion of speeches and demonstrations stressing theindissoluble unity of the Reich. Hitler&apos;s speech on Heroes&apos; Day providedmaterial on this point. The subservience of Slovakia was given more importance even than that of the protectorate.More prominence than of late has been given to German musicalactivities, lecture tours and exhibitions in the Balkans and Scandinavia.The newly-formed Society for South-East Europe appears to have already started activities.
2. Military Operations.This theme remains much more important in propaganda to the homepopulation and to the neutrals than in propaganda to Britain and France.The most prominent item is still the destruction of shipping, about one-thirdof this topic being concerned with attacks from the air. The publicitygiven to the High Commands report on six months of hostilities died downquickly after two days. The most important item in land operations wasthe capture of sixteen English prisoners on the West Front. This wasillustrated, according to the German custom, by radio interviews with the prisoners and their captors.GermanyBritain,France; !Neutrals12% (1.1%)8*% (s%)i.% (s.v%):12%(11-5%);3. Neutrals Oppose Allies.There has been a noticeable rise in this type of propaganda, due mainly Germany, 4% (2i%)to the Italian protest on the stopping of German coal shipments, and to a pra*ice&apos;3% m%)lesser extent to the Scandinavian attitude towards the Finnish war. Neutrals, 5i% (4%)4. British Weakness.This theme has grown owing to an increase in the attention paid, in propaganda to all countries, to British military weakness, and a returntowards their former importance of attacks upon the British social system in propaganda to Great Britain.Propaganda on British military weakness was concentrated equally uponthe effects of the Russo-Finnish peace defeat and the loss of sea. supremacy.The Allies were not only unwilling, but unable, to implement any promises ofassistance made to smaller nations. Their plot to intercept Germany&apos;siron ore supplies from Sweden had been finally defeated.The decline of British sea power had gone so far that neutral sailorsrefused to sail to England and the very mention of the North Sea plungedthem into panic. The Queen Elizabeth zigzagged hastily across the Atlantic,with lifeboats at the ready and a heavily bribed crew, because English portswere no longer safe. Scapa Flow had been evacuated, and the British fleet was skulking in the Western ports.There was little change in the volume of attack upon British economicweakness, though this was no longer the most important subdivision of thetheme. Stress was laid upon the general shortage of everything, from foreign exchange to coal and chickens. The difficulties of war finance andthe decline of British prestige had depressed the pound to a new low level.The continual rise in prices and the failure of the export drive made inflationinevitable.British social weakness was approximately half-way between the low level of the previous fortnight and its usual prominence. Stress was laidnot on a single point in particular, but rather on the general theme of wide-spread corruption and the callous attitude of wealth to poverty and suffering.Among the points mentioned were corruption in the Ministry of Supply, softjobs in Whitehall, the refusal of allowances and pensions for the dependants of soldiers and sailors, strip-tease for &quot; charity,&quot; Lord NuffieWs consciencemoney, and Sir John Reith&apos;s preference for six-course dinners and white ties.Britahrs internal political weakness was demonstrated by the generaldissatisfaction at the Governments treatment of the Finnish question andby the growth of anti-war sentiment.Propaganda concerning dissensions within the Empire has slightlyincreased, except to neutral countries. Much the most important item wasthe assassination of Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer. By this act, it was said, thewhole oppressed and suffering people of India demonstrated their bitternessand rage, and their stormy urge to freedom. Of much less prominence werereports of I.R.A. activities and the demand for a united Ireland, topics usedmainly for home consumption and for the neutrals. Mention was also madeof General Hertzog&apos;s and Mr. Pirow&apos;s sympathy for Germany; of Jewishunrest in Palestine; of strikes in Cyprus, Auckland, Singapore and australia; of unrest in the West Indies; and of the lukewarmness of canadian support.[21024] .

5. French Weakness.Germany, 4% (1%) This theme has doubled in importance during the current fortnight asFrlnc&quot;&apos; ilk (%f-&apos;) a result of the Russo-Finnish peace. The emphasis on French militaryNeutrals, 7j% *M%) weakness has been trebled, while French economic weakness has also gainedin interest.    Attention was paid to the severity of French rationingmeasures, to labour shortage, and to the plight of French agriculture.   the franc, together with the pound sterling, is&quot; falling in value, while Frenchprices rise together with English prices.France&apos;s internal political weakness was shown by the general dissatis-faction with the Government over the censorship and over the Finnish war.There was a widespread demand for the replacement of M. Daladier by amilitary Government under Marshal Petain.6. British Brutality and Unscrupulousness.Germany, 19% (35%) The decline in this theme, even after allowing for the subsidence of france &apos; il% (30%) indignation over the Altmark incident, has been remarkable. The stress hasNeutrals, 17% been shifted from &quot; atrocities &quot; to Britain&apos;s desire to exploit other nations.(30*%) The most important topic has been Britain&apos;s attempt to torpedo the Russo-Finnish peace negotiations and to extend the war to Scandinavia. Britain,having betrayed Finland, was now trying to find a new battlefield in theNear East.The main atrocity charges brought against Great Britain were thefollowing: her brutality in the colonies; &quot;the blood-bath of Amritsar &quot;;Colonel Wedgwood&apos;s proposal that German airmen should be left to drown;and the Daily MaiVs suggestion that Poles should act as warders overGermans in the internment oamps. The British Secret Service, having added the bomb outrage against the German colony at Montevideo to its record,was now discovered to have sabotaged the aeroplane in which Mr. Crossley,M.P., met his death.Great Britain continued to force neutral ships to sail in the &quot; waters of death &quot; around her coast and to hold up Greek, Roumanian and Americanshipping on the high seas and even in their own territorial waters.7. French Brutality and TJnscruptdousness.Germany, 51% (34%.) This theme has increased in importance owing to the concentration uponFr!ulceV&apos; ciV(tj%) ^e Allied exploitation of other countries. No distinction was made betweenNeutrals. 7j&quot;% (5$-%) the French and the British in their desire to extend the war to scandinavia and to the Near East.  France, like Britain, had betrayed Finland.Among the minor charges brought against France were the searching of japanese ships, the destruction of Belgian mail, and the harbouring of spanish &quot; Reds.&quot;An interesting example of the German technique of attacking the enemy on Germany&apos;s own weak points was the accusation that France herselfpersecuted Catholic priests.-8. Britain Lies.There has been a remarkable decline in the importance of this themeexcept in propaganda to France. The main charge was that Mr. winston churchill concealed Britain&apos;s shipping losses and exaggerated her navalsuccesses, and that the R.A.F. dropped their leaflets over the North Seainstead of on Berlin.The official admission that there had been an influenza epidemic in theBritish Expeditionary Force was contrasted with the War Office communiqueof the 26th January, which stated that there was not a word of truth in the story.The fact that Mr. Churchill had sunk the A thenia was again proved bya claim for damages brought by some American survivors against theshipping company.Germany, &quot;i % (6%)Britain, 31% (7%)France, 6% (64%)Neutrals, 34% (5%)

Daladier&apos;s statement that norway had refused to allow the passage of Allied troops to Finland.Ridicule was also cast on French allegations that messages broadcast byprisoners of war in Germany were falsifications.10. Allied War Guilt.The customary allegation was made that the Allies had refused allHitler&apos;s offers of understanding, and had finally launched the long-desiredwar of unprovoked aggression. The eagerness of German propaganda to exploit this line is shown by its readiness to snatch at trifles. Mr. oliver stanley&apos;s speech of the 10th March was seized upon to prove that GreatBritain had been preparing for war not only before the occupation ofPrague, but even before Munich.This theme is pervasive throughout the whole of German propagandarather than an unmixed line. A typical example is the continual use of suchphrases as the &quot; British wrar &quot; or &quot; British warmongers &quot; in propagandadevoted to other subjects.The topic is important in certain forms of home publicity, such as posterpropaganda. During the current fortnight a nationally advertised &quot; WarGuilt Supplement &apos;&apos; was issued by an important illustrated weekly.11. Allied War Aims.In its attempt to persuade the world, and particularly the home popula-tion, that the Allies wished to dismember Germany, the PropagandaMinistry made considerable use of Otto von Hapsburg&apos;s plan for theestablishment of a^ Central European Federal Monarchy. It was stated thatthis plan had been drawn up with the consent of Mr. Chamberlain andM. Daladier. London and Paris were forced to call in this degenerate cretinof the political underworld in order to realise their dark ambitions.The Allied aims for the annihilation, partition, destruction and disarment of Germany were demonstrated in speeches by Hitler, Buerckeland the lesser leaders.Greater emphasis was laid, as usual, upon this theme in the german press than in broadcasts, and, to a still greater extent, in speeches at Partymeetings.12. German War A ims.German war aims during the current fortnight were defined as the achievement of Lebensraum, the destruction of English plutocracy, and thecreation of a new social order based upon justice and the recognition of theplace due to the younger nations. While these definitions have becomeslightly more precise than of late, the volume of propaganda devoted to thetheme was practically negligible. &apos;13. Britain Exploits France.This theme was of serious interest only in propaganda to France, towhich country it has remained fairly steady during the past two months.The most important item was the inadequacy of the British Expe- Neutrals, i% (i%)ditionary Force, contrasted with the labour shortage in France and themillions of unemployed in England. Bad feeling continued to exist between british and French troops. Despite the consolations of the AuxiliaryTerritorial Service, the British soldier was always ready to outrage Frenchwomen and to lock French soldiers out of brothels. M. Daladier took his orders from London, and was fighting to the last Frenchman and to the lastfranc for the glory of Britain.14. Germany Offers Friendship to France.This theme remains at its previous level of insignificance.  It is employed Germany, - (-)only in propaganda to France. &apos; ^ ((7^)Neutrals,   ( )Germany, 1% (1%)Britain, - (1%)France, 1% (1%)Neutrals, 1% (1%)Germany, 1^Britain, 1%. dl%)(H%)

The Capitalist War.The true importance of this theme can be estimated only by consideringFraVico,&apos;u%^ together with the points included under German Social Strength, BritishNeutrals, j% (1%)   Social Weakness and French Social Weakness.    The magnitude of the comprehensive theme &quot; The Old Social Order against the New &quot; is shown inthe following table.   (The figures for the previous fortnight are given In brackets) : Germany. 71% (7%).Britain. 13*% (9%).France, 5f% (5%).Neutrals, 5% (5^%).Social propaganda to Great Britain has returned to something of itsprevious importance, while to other countries it has remained at approxi-mately the same low level as during the previous fortnight. On the averageit is at still less than two-thirds of its usual strength.The general theme is that the Western plutocracies, in their death-agonies, are fighting to preserve themselves against the young Germansocialism. The German press now quotes from the British Daily Worker,but describes it only as a &quot; Labour newspaper.&quot;During the last month lantern lectures on the subject of &quot; Plutocracyand Jewry &quot; have been given all over Germany, and a series of Partymeetings has been held in Austria on the subject of &quot; German Labour againstJewish-English Capitalism.&apos;&apos;16. A nti-Seviitism.Brifern-iiHiJ%%) This theme&apos; like that of Allied War Guilt, is pervasive rather than anPraime&apos;i%(2*) unmixed line of propaganda. Some of the points made during the currentNeutrals, 1% (1%) fortnight were: that the Jews, who have made the war, have now got softjobs in the army; that, out of 54 Home Defence &quot;organisers&quot; in GreatBritain, 35 are Jewish financiers; that Mr. Winston Churchill is under thesway of his Jewish bankers; and that Jews and Freemasons are planningwar on Italy.These sixteen themes constitute the main lines of German propaganda.The following individual points, however, deserve mention :- (a) Considerable stress was still placed upon Polish atrocities committedagainst Germans, as an antidote to the Allied charges of german atrocities on Poles.(b) German denunciations of the unneutrality of the Dutch and the swiss press remained at a high level, but there have been fewerthreats of the type &quot; Be neutral or take the consequences.&quot;(c) Considerable interest was taken in the presence of the Allied airchiefs in Ankara and in the Allied forces assembled in the near east.   The purpose of these forces was represented as a threat to both Russia and to South-East Europe.(cl) There was a slight but increasing stress, in broadcasts to Spain, on german sympathy with Spanish colonial claims in North Africa.(e) In one broadcast to Spanish America it was stated that the Orkneysand the Shetlands should belong to Norway.
