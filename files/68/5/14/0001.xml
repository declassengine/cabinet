The members of the Midland Area board have been appointed, and the Birmingham Area Advisory Committeewas inaugurated on January 19thD     As soon as the members ofthe   Area Boards have been appointed by the Departments concerned,and active steps arc being taken to this end, Area Advisoryjkommittees will he set up at another ten places.     Nominations:nave already been received for eight of these Committees.- 1 -/As

As each Advisory Committee is inaugurated; it .isproposed to divert to it any offers of capacity from firmswithin its area, so that the offers may he considered and suggestions made as to their use0     Arrangements are also hcingmade to supply the Committees with particulars of stores whichare required and which can he manufactured hy the smaller firms.PART II - MUNITIONS STORES.5, Production during the month was materially affectedby the severe weather and hy the heavy snowfall0     The lahourstrength of manufacturers was seriously reduced oving:to sickness and transport difficulties,,      In the circumstances,deliveries during the month were not unsatisfactory, hut someof the adverse after-effects are hound to reflect on the deliveries during later months.6. In connection with the discussions which have been proceeding on the Military Co-ordination Committee, revisedproduction programmes up to the end of the second year of war have been prepared.     Proposals are now &quot;being put forward for additional manufacturing capacity for guns, mountings andcarriages, shell, etc,7. New schemes and developments approved during themonth included:--      Guns.      Increased manufacturing capacity is &quot;being provided under the&apos; Monotype Corporation scheme so as to double the output previously approved.     Capacity for the manufactureof Bren guns is also heing created at one of the two new RifleFactories, hy installing plant common to the production of hotnweapons.These schemes will bring the total planned capacity for Bren guns to 4.500 a month,20 m.m.

(3) Sandbags.     Of the 20,000,000 sandbags which the War Officeagreed to release to the French, 9,000,000 have been delivered to them in London and the French have agreed to take delivery of the rest at Le Havre from supplies now en route from India.(4) Webbing for Anklets and Web Equipment..     The French submitted a request for 1,000,000 metres of webbing for anklets, but itwas impossible to meet the demand immediately.     Since, however,the matter was urgent, 21,000 yards were released and shippedto FranceoThe War Office having agreed to release 100,000 ankletsor the equivalent in canvas, the latter - 41,700 yards - hasalso been sent to France.An offer of 1,700 yards of genuine anklet canvas, whichwas surplus to an Air Ministry contract, has been accepted atthe original price of 3/6d0 a yard, which compares with 5/6d,to-day0(5) Rubber Trench Boots.     The War Office agreed to release40-507000 pairs in December, 1939, and 50-100,000 pairs inJanuary, 1940.

The itemsfor which demands have been received include hooks and eyes,&quot;buckles,. tin-plate, buttons, tunic material and sewing cottons.B.    GENERAL STORES.28. Raw Materials,..The difficulties mentioned in last month&apos;s report Inrespect of timber, Kraft-board, tin-plate and sheet steelcontinue and in an accentuated degree.      Inability of contractorsto quote except for three of four months ahead is now a commonfeature0     The War Office have agreed that demands shall be formulated on the assumption that delivery cannot commence untilfour months ahead (a further reference to this is made inparagraph 33 below)a5- 8 -/(29)

29. Timber.Further specifications have been revised and practically all the main items have been dealt with.     B *adly it may beassumed that these revised specifications have effected a saving of 25Jo of timber.The possibility of substitutes is still being explored.The I.C.I. product was mentioned last month and experiments are continuing.     Meanwhile, a new plastic in which ground slate is used, and which has a polished surface, has been produced and isunder examination.Rationing procedure has commenced and certificatesgiving contractors authority to apply to the Timber Control fora licence to purchase are now issued in respect of all contracts.30, Woodware Firms.Applications from firms to be added to the Departmentslist of tenderers still continue to be received at the rate ofover 100 a week.     The grouping system ib being oortinued.31. Tln-nlate.The position of this material is how almost acute, sofar as heavy gauges are Concerned!   ...The demand for ^-gallonpetrol eans in 20 S.W.G. (for multiple journeys from the fillingstations in France and the forwards areas) is so heavy that theexisting sources of supply in Soutii Wales ;cahnot give the output.Meetings With trie Trade have been arranged ttt consider theproblem.On the advice of the Tin-Plate Control, dinner platesand soup basins in still lighter gauges are being accepted.32* Steel. - See paragraph       below.33. Kraft-Board. - See paragraph 5-9 below,3h. Waterbottlea.The sample bottles made of tin-plate and re-tinned byelectrolysis, referred to in the last report, were examined bythe Royal Army Medical College and rejected,     Further samplesare being made and will be submitted to the same authority.The provision of felt covers for the enamelled ironbottles is still a difficulty.35. Small (Bench) Tools.Further new sources of supply for some articles havebeen found but the difficulty of capacity is still pronounced,particularly in regard to pliers.     Among the bodies which,together with the ministry&apos;s Area Organisation, are seekingnew sources are London, Sheffield, Baritsley and Hull chambers of Commerce;   the Society of Motor Manikfacturers and Traders;and the Cycle Manufacturers1 Association.36, Army Hut Camps.It has been decided that contracts for these huts andtheir component parts shall remain with the War Office.37. Paint.Agreement has been reached with the Paint Federation inregard to the allocation of approximately 1,500,000 lb. of paint.- 9 - /38.

38. Provisioning.It- has been agreed by the War Office that provision should be on a broad basis and should be well, ahead.&apos; ,&apos; TJie   &apos;;. arrangement is that provision action should be initiated four months before first deliveries are required and the quantities-should be for six months;    thus for items for which provisionaction is taken in March, delivery will be over the period july-December.     Provision action for the same items shouldcommence again in September for deliveries over the periodJanuary to June.PART IV - RAW MATERIALS,35. Shortage of shipping tonnage continues to be agoverning factor in the supply of essential raw materials,although there have been certain slight but definiteimprovements;   the areas which present the greatest difficultyat present are Australia, South and East Africa, N. Americaand Calcutta,-A further review of future programmes which has beenmade hy the Ministry of Shipping indicates that considerable. further reduction of imports will be necessary.     For this and other reasons further attention is being paid to thereduction of civil consumption,     A rationing scheme for paper is being introduced, and a rationing scheme for cotton goodsis under consideration.     Restrictions An a number of othercontrolled materials are being applied by a licencing system.40. Iron and Steel.The relation of the demand to the supply of steel has again been considered by the Priority machinery.     Since thelast revision, demands have been increasing, while production inthis country has only been maintained by encroaching on reserves of raw materials, and imports have fallen below the amountcontracted for.      On the basis of present production and rateof imports, the present demand at 17i million ingot tons is2i million ingot tons in excess of the probable supplies available for 1940.     Moreover, in the event of war activitydeveloping in France, it is probable that some of the Frenchworks will be put out of action and further demands will bemade on this country by France.Iron and Steel prices have been raised with effect from the 1st February by 3/- per ton for pig iron, and  1 per tonfor billets and heavy steel, with corresponding Increases on more finished products.     As in the November increase, thepresent increase is based entirely on the higher cost of imported materials and finished steel (these costs being met from a central fund), and on consequential increases in wages and cokeprices,k*. Aluminium.As the result of a visit of the Aluminium controller to Canada, arrangements have been made, with Treasury approval,for expanding the Canadian production of aluminium by 65,000tons per annum, the first instalment of the Increase coming intooperation towards the end of 1940.     The capital cost is about 30,000,000,There have been suggestions that the French, wIqO areexpanding their production, could expand still further to meet/British

British requirements, hut enquiry in Paris has shown this tobe inaccurate.      The French will want the whole of the increased production that can be made possible by using to the full theirwater power resources, and they have indicated that they may need assistance from us in addition.2. Copper, Lead and Zinc.The supply position is in general satisfactory.Arrangements are being made for zinc concentrates to be smeltedin Belgium, on joint Anglo-French account, to provide theadditional zinc required to balance the allied requirements,     Ajoint zinc concentrate programme has also been drawn up as theresult of a review of the world concentrate position, andarrangements arc now being made to secure as far as possibleadequate shipping.3. Brass.The increased demand for armament brass &quot;(particularlyrolled brass), makes it necessary to organize the brass industryto meet the position.     Arrangements are being made to strengthenand extend the scope of the Non-Ferrous Metals Control by theappointment of a Deputy Controller with special experience ofthe brass industry.      Consumption of copper and zinc and theproduction of brass for non-essential purposes are being restricted in order to safeguard the supply position.kc Tin.The improving supply position has enabled snme tinto be released for export to countries where this was ofpolitical importance.5. Chrome Ore.The pre-emptive purchases in Greece and Yugo-Slavia,the guarantee on the sale of Turkish output up to 250,000tons per annum, and the shipping difficulties from South africa and Rhodesia (our normal source of supply), have made itnecessary to consider&apos; setting up some form of Control.6. Tungsten.Arrangements have been made to secure substantially the whole of the Empire and British controlled supplies.      Atthe same time discussions are proceeding in connection with aproposal, to purchase wolfram in China and Siam, primarily onpre-emptive grounds, and efforts are being made to enlist thesupport of the United States Government in this proposal.Without their assistance, the large quantities involved andthe high price which would probably have to be paid would create difficulties.      The high price in particular might upset thesupply contracts with Burmese and Malayan producers,&apos; Sulphuric Acid - Pyrites and Acid Sulphur.All acid plants are working at full capacity and needsare barely being met.      The stock position of raw materials atworks is still deteriorating, but more ships have been fixed for March, and the position should, therefore, shortly improve.Great difficulty is, however, being experienced in securingsmall boats, which are required for loading and discharge atsmall ports abroad and in the U.K.0- 11   -

hS* Regular Sulphur.The regular sulphur position remains serious, as there are small stocks in this country, and manufacturers are dependent on the safe arrival of the vessels now chartered.UB* Inorganic Fertilisers.There has &quot;been much more success in fixing ships, andthe supply position of phosphate rock is improving.     There isat present full production;   hut the industry is dependent onthe acid supply position.50. Mercury.Purchase has been completed on Ministry account of5,000 bottles of Italian mercury for payment through the clearing..     Shipment is in course of being made.The Control of Mercury No. 3 Order came into force on 29th January, fixing fresh maximum prices for the moreimportant mercury salts.     On 26th January the price of mercurywas raised by the Italo-Spanish Cartel for the fourth time since the outbreak of war to $200 f.o.b.  (i.e, about  50) perbottle of 76 lb., the pre-war price being  16, 10s. per bottle.5t. Molasses.The arrangements under which we have taken over the stocks of molasses held at home and abroad by the DistillersCompany and United Molasses Company Ltd., and are using thelatter as our agents, are in general working satisfactorily.Discussions with the Ministry of Shipping, however, have shownthat, in view of the shortage- of tankers and the long haulinvolved, it will not be possible to transport the stacks ofmolasses held in Java.     The alternative, which is underconsideration, is to buy this year&apos;s output of   Cuban high testmolasses, which involves a much shorter haul, and to hold the. Java molasses, which have a lower sugar content, in reserve for the time being.52. Timber.The supply position is not unsatisfactory for hardwood,but will remain serious for softwood until adequate shipping space is made available.      In the meantime, every possibleeconomy in the use of timber is being explored by the TimberEconomy Sub-Committee of the Joint Production and MaterialsPriority Sub-Committee,A comprehensive programme for increasing home production has also been submitted to the Treasury Inter-Service Committee,53. Hides. Skins. Leather and Tanning Materials.The improvement in the shipping position reported last month has been maintained and supplies of most kinds ofhides, skins and tanning materials came forward moderately well.Imports of hides and skins in December were about 20 per centgreater than the monthly average for January/August, and supplies were approximately equal to requirements in mostdescriptions.     Input at tanneries (apart from a small falling   -off due to the Christmas holiday).was maintained at the Novemberlevel, which was higher than the pre-war rate by some 25 percent, in the case of sole leather and by varying lesser ratesfor other kinds-.- 12 -/The

The procedure by which leather is reserved for service requirements is working more smoothly0     Exports ofdressed leather and of footwear in December wore much more satisfactory than in previous monthscArrangements to facilitate the purchase of leather inthis country by the French Purchasing Mission, with theassistance of the Control, have continued;, and the Mission istrying to improve the supply of calf skins and chestnut extractfrom Prance to the United Kingdom,,5&amp;. FleiXoDifficulties in securing supplies from the Balticcontinue     An agreement has been reached with the French,governing Anglo&quot;-French purchases in Belgium and other fH.ax- .producing countries     Purchases in Belgium are beingtemporarily reduced in an effort to secure supplies at more reasonable prices,,     As the result of representations by theGovernment of Northern Ireland, an average price of  160 per tonhas been guaranteed for the IShC Northern Ireland crope     Thesame guarantee has been offered to EireDIn order that arrangements can be made for the properdistribution of-flax seed in Northern Ireland, stocks have beenrequisitioned and further quantities of seed are being purchased by the Ministry,The control of prices of the type of flax yarns mainlyproduced in Northern Ireland, which are used in the export trade,has been removed.,55. Hemp,oThe supply position continues to be satisfactoryQNegotiations have been concluded in Rome for the supply of10,000 tons of Italian hemp (mainly as a substitute for flax),and discussions concerning an additional quantity are now proceeding,,     The procedure in regard to purchases on behalf ofFrance is now virtually completed,50. Jute.Prices fluctuated but fell to about  39 per tontowards the end of the month on the reduction of government contracts for sandbags from India,      Stocks of raw jute inDundee have improved, about 25,000 tons having arrived duringthe month,57. Rayon.In view of the fact that Service requirements arenegligible and of an assurance given by the rayon and staplefibre producers that they will keep prices at a reasonablelevel, the statutory control of prices has been withdrawn.Firm prices will be quoted as far ahead as possible in theinterests of the export trade.     Prices have been increased by3d. a pound058. Wool.An examination of the requirements of the UnitedKingdom, the Empire and France for crossbred wool against theEmpire supplies available, which was made by the Priorityorganization, showed a serious shortage, which it is hoped partly to cover by the purchase of further supplies in South America.Endeavours are being made to ensure non-competitive buying if theFrench and the Canadians also buy in this market0     Arrangements13 -/are

- 14 -/members are also &quot;being made for the purchase of the Falkland Islandswool clip..As from the 15th January, the centralised slaughteringscheme of the Ministry of Food came into force, and from thatdate wooled sheepskins from the slaughtered animals have beenbought from the Ministry of Food by the Wool Control, whichhas them fellmongered on commission..    The wool so obtainedpasses into the Control&apos;s stocks.     The amount of wool involved is round about 30 million lb., a year.59. Paper.Although wood pulp continues to arrive in satisfactoryquantities and the esparto position shows some improvement,the necessity for economising in shipping and currency andat the same time ensuring adequate supplies of paper and board for essential requirements has led to the preparation of ascheme for rationing both home-produced and imported paper which will be introduced at the beginning of March.The shortage of timber for packing cases has resultedin a demand for Kraft pulp board which has far out-strippedthe present home production of 50,000 tons a year, and, althoughsteps are being taken to double home production, the growing demand for essential requirements will still necessitatesubstantial imports of board from the U..S.A.     An investigation is proceeding with the object of securing economies in boththe quantity and the design of Kraft-board containers with aview to reducing the demand for shipping and dollars.$0. Cotton.Supplies of American commercial cotton are nowadequate, and, in view of arrangements made with the Ministryof Shipping for the allocation of freight space, the industry&apos;sneeds up to the end of August are assured.      Supplies of cottonother than American are also generally up to normal.The spinners&apos; &quot;margins&quot; for most classes of yarns havebeen fixed by Order;    in general, the margins specified areappreciably lower than those previously ruling,      The Orderintorduces a measure of stability into yarn prices, and it ishoped that one result will be to assist the export trade.There is a congestion of orders on spinners&apos; booksfor American   yarns and it is proposed shortly to issue an Orderwith a view to securing preferential delivery of yarns requiredfor Government and export purposes.6*. Mica,Stocks at the end of 1939 were satisfactory.      shipments of munitions grade mica from India will in future be permittedonly to the U.K.;   hence supplies of ruby mica for allied needsshould be assured.     Arrangements have also been made with theFrench for adequate supplies of Madagascar amber mica,62. Rubber.Stocks of rubber fell sharply during January as aresult of the very low shipments from the East in November.This drop in stocks is likely to continue in February,     supplies in the U.K, at the present time are, however, equal to nearlyfour months&apos; consumption, and January shipments are much betterthan those of previous months.     A further approach to the

members of the Rubber Growers1 Association has been made witha view to securing early shipments of available unsoldsupplies, and as a result shipments in Pebruary are, it isunderstood, likely to be above consumption.PART V - SALVAGE.i&quot;   Military Salvage.The site for Reception Depot No. 1 at Lydney,GlosB, having been approved, the Office of   Works have drawn the plans and the O.W.Railway are commencing work on thesiding0A survey is being made of sites accessible toSouthampton for Reception Depot No. 2.The responsibility for the disposal in Prance of army salvage not to be returned home has been allocated to theMinistry, and steps are being taken to establish a small branchin PariSo     Meanwhile, sales of petrol tins have been effected by Army Departments.A conference was held with the Air Ministry, at whichrecommendations were made for extending salvage work in theAir Force.6-   Civilian Salvage.Further district conferences with Local Authoritieshave been held, and nearly all parts of the country have nowbeen covered by these conferences and by the 22 Honorary DistrictAdvisers0Returns of salvage work for December show the firsteffect of the recommendations made to Local Authorities.
