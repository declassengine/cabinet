Evacuation.7.     While figures are not yet available, present informationsuggests that the immediate response to the invitation toparents in the evacuation areas to register their childrenfor evacuation under the new scheme, and to householders inthe reception areas to enrol themselves as willing to receivechildren, has not been large.,8.     Arrangements have been made in co-operation with theMinistry of Infftrmatipn to take space in the weekly papers whichcirculate in the reception areas, in order to draw attention tothe importance of keeping ths. .children there, to. the value ofthe work done by householders who care for them, and to theneed for other householders, to help in this work.9.      Circulars have been issued to leal authorities emphasising the undesirability of the return of children to the evacuationareas during the Easter holidays0     A notice to this effect has been handed tp parents in the evacuation areas.10.      Following a discussion by the Advisory Committee aboutthe medical examination of children before evacuation, a circularhas been issued to local authorities giving detailed guidance on this subject.      All children registered for evacuation inthe event       raids are to be examined as soon as possible afterregistration and, where necessary, are to receive treatment soas to render them suitable for billeting on private householders.After the initial examination, all children will be kept undermedical supervision, and will, so far as practicable, be examinedagain immediately before evacuation takes place.      On arrival in the reception areas, the responsibility for further examinationwill rest on the school medical service of the area concerned,and special centres are to be set up in each area for thispurpose.

Public Order.11a      There has been n; ohservahle change in the character and scale t-;f the activities of the Communist Party, the Peace PledgeUnion and the British Union of Fascists, hut there is stillgeneral agreement that they are making little headway, and thereis increasing evidence of public hostility towards the anti-warrganisations and towards conscientious objectors.      A strikewas caused at one factory by the employment  of a conscientiousObjector.Railways^12.      Having regard to the effect of the recent exceptionalweather conditions upon the ability of traders to comply withthe Railways (Demurrage Charges) Order, 1939, it has beendecided that demurrage charges incurred between the 18th December,1939, and the 29th February, 1940, shall he waived and that theadditional 24 hours&apos;  free time allowed to coal merchants, whichwould otherwise have come to an end at the 31st March, shall beextended until 30th June.&quot;.IWcks and Harbours.13c      The ports are now working without undue pressure anderuditions generally are satisfactory.      There is, however, some delay to ships leading coal for export at the South Wales portsdue to shortage of supplies of coal.Read Transport.14.      The position as regards both goods and passenger road transport continues t-o be satisfactory.      The fuel rations issued for the operation of goods vehicles show an upward tendency asa censequence of the return to normal weather conditions.Central Register of Accommodajt^ic..yn.M15, There are now over 45,000 entries (nearly double the figureat the outbreak of war) in the Central Register of Accommodation,
