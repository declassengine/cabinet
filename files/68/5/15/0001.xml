(R.)(40)61.)(Initialled) G. L.Richmond Terrace,S.W.1.20th February,  1940.

COAL     POSITION.ELEVENTH FORTNIGHTLY REPORT.SUPPLIES.In the supplement to the tenth Eortnightly Report which I.submitted on the 14th February, I stated that I had asked theMinister of Transport for absolute priority for a few days to begiven to coal on the railways,,Following a meeting of the Transport Priority Committee, it wasarrangedon the 15th February that all coal should for one week be accorded the same priority as is at present granted to coal for public Utility Undertakings, perishable foodstuffs and other urgentgoods including stores for Navy, Army and Air Force establishments.The effect of this priority, as will be seen from the figures given in Appendix I, has not yet shown itself substantially exceptfor a slight improvement in the number of wagons passing over fromthe Northern to the Southern systems.The railway companies had planned to secure a big movement ofcoal during the weekend, but unfortunately once more they werehampered by bad weather as snow fell heavily in the Forth midlands and in Yorkshire from midday to midnight on Sunday,The position in Glasgow has now been eased and the specialofficer sent up by the Department on the 14th February reports thathe is satisfied that the arrangements now made will secure that coalwill be available to everyone who needs it, subject^ of course, tothe maintenance of the present rationing scheme by which householdsare limited to a maximum of 2 cwts. a week.In the South of England, however, the position is still veryprecarious and complaints are received every day from a number ofdistricts complaining that they are out of coal.     Though the position may sometimes not be quite so bad as is pictures, It remains true thatthere is an extreme shortage of coal in London and the South of England,The position in London can be judged from the fact that in a peakperiod the L.M.S. Depots in London would usually contain 3,500 to 4,000full wagons of coal and would clear 800/900 wagons per day.

- 2 -    -Recently the following is the number of full wagons in these Depots:16th February - 1,36016th &quot; 1,45517th &quot; 1,673Coal is moving over the railways but stocks have been heavilyreduced while the demand is abnormal and must remain abnormal untilthe arrears accumulated during the extreme weather (which followed aI   month during which transport was hampered) have been liquidated,A statement showing the quantities of coal shipped by sea toI   London and the South Coast during the last four months of 1939 andi   showing a drop of 2 million tons as compared with the correspondingperiod of the previous year, is attached for information (Appendix II)..PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT.The working of the mines has been seriously affected by the weather, and the transport dislocation caused by the weather, resulting in a substantial decline in production of saleable coal, the total forthe fortnight ended 3rd February being 7,675,000 tons, or 1,765,000I   tons less than a year ago.ITEM	11940		1939		Week ending 27th Jan.

-3-EXPORTS.Exports were not affected by weather and transport difficulties to the same extent as was production, possibly on account of theproximity to the coast of some of the main exporting districts.The total quantity of coal shipped abroad, including the coalequivalent of coke and manufactured fuel for the fortnight ended3rd February was 1,436,000 tons, or 236,000 tons less than for thecorresponding period last year.ITEMtal Quantity of Goalhipped abroadincluding the coaluivalent of coke andnufactured fuel).1940Week ending27th Jan.Tons751Week ending3rd Feb.Tons6852 Weeksending3rd Feb.Tons1,43619393 Weeksending4th Feb.Tons1,672WAGES AGREEMENT.Following the acceptance by the Miners&apos; Delegate Conferenceon the 25th January of the Owners&apos;  offer of an increase of 5d. pershift for January, February and March, the provisional agreement was referred back to the districts and adopted by them by 524,000votes to 70,000 (the dissenting districts being Scotland and a fewsmall districts).      The Agreement was then signed on the9th February at a Meeting of the National Joint consultative committee of the Mining Association and the Mineworkers&apos; Federation.A last minute hitch arising out of a lack of mutual understandingon the retrospective application of the Agreement to January and february was adjusted to the satisfaction of both parties and withinthe sense of the original intention.

PIT PROP SUPPLIES.The supply position is unchanged.      South Wales has beenliving beyond its means,  though there is a 6 to 7 weeks&apos;supply of timber available at the Collieries.There are ample supplies of wood ready in Prance andto a lesser extent in Portugal.      The rate of production in thewoods of both Countries is greater than the available shippingcapacity.As regards Timber supplies for England and Scotland,the main hope lies in the provision of shipping from Canada.There is nothing further to report in this respect.      HomeGrown timber supplies are available in increasing quantities,but the weather during the last six Y/eeks has hinderedoperations in the woods.STEEL.The promised supply of continental steel has not yet arrived in Britain but the first instalment is expected withina week.      This steel,  if used as face supports, will have thebest effect in reducing the demand for timber, but it may benecessary to use it to make arches for road supports.
