General Position.The General Election took place on the 26th March and resulted in a recordvictory for the present Government. The new Parliament will assemble on the25th April.2. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.(i) Army.- The Canadian Government propose to despatch the second division of the Active Service Force to this country about the beginning of July,and it is contemplated that mechanical transport for the division will be assembledin England about the same date. On this basis it is expected that the second division will be in a position to proceed to the Front a,t the beginning of November.(ii) Air Force. An Army Co-operation Squadron of the Royal Canadian AirForce has arrived in this country.It has been announced that the war establishment of the Royal CanadianAir Force has been increased by nearly 14,000 men and that provision has beenmade for a total personnel of 30,400 (2,400 officers and 28,000 men).Discussions are proceeding with a view to a possible meeting between representatives of the Governments concerned to consider the allocation of personnel trained under the Empire Air Training Scheme.In response to an approach by the Newfoundland Government, the canadian government have offered to make available for the defence of Newfoundland, if required, aircraft of the Royal Canadian Air Force, in addition to two 4-7 inch guns and two searchlights.[21075] this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;8 governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1940.
3. Legislative A ction.There is nothing to report.4. Economic Action.(i) Manufacture of Munitions.-Orders for finished munitions and raw-materials required for war purposes continue to be placed in Canada throughthe Canadian War Supply Board, a member of which has recently been in london for discussions with United Kingdom Ministers and officials. These include ajoint order with the Canadian Government for minesweepers.(ii) Economic Warfare. Since early in the present year the United Kingdomand Canadian Governments have been in consultation regarding the establishmentof a control base in Canadian waters for the examination of passengers andcrews, and possibly also for that of mails and certain work in connexion withcargoes. While the matter is still under discussion at Washington, the canadian government have indicated their willingness to co-operate with a view toremoving one of the outstanding sources of difficulty between the United Kingdomand the United States.The Canadian Government also took certain preliminary steps at the requestof the Government of the United Kingdom for the surveillance of the movements of a Russian ship which was carrying war materials from America toVladivostok, thought to be destined for the enemy, and was reported to be likelyto call at Seattle. The vessel was eventually intercepted 100 miles off the coast of Japan and taken into Hong Kong.(iii) Finance. The first Canadian war loan, for $200 million, which wasfloated early this year at par, was over-subscribed by 61 per cent., after the listshad been opened for two days, the terms being 3^ per cent, redeemable at parbetween 1948 and 1952 by annual drawings of equal amounts.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.5. General Position.The Government have been subjected to severe criticism during the past few weeks on account of an agreement, under the new Motor Bounty Act, withthe Australian Consolidated Industries for the manufacture of motors, and an&quot;indiscretion&quot;&apos; on tihe part of Mr. Lawson (Minister for Customs). As theresult of action taken by the Leaders of the Labour and Country Parties, theoperation of the agreement has been suspended until it has been approved byParliament, and Mr. Lawson has resigned.This, no doubt, had its effect upon the Corio by-election, when the Governmentcandidate was defeated. The by-election resulted from the appointment ofMr. R. G. Casey, Minister for Supply and Development, as the first Ministerof the Commonwealth of Australia to the United States. Shortly afterwards,the Prime Minister approached the Country Party with an offer of co-operation,and a Coalition Ministry has been formed under the leadership of Mr. Menzies.The Country Party hold five seats in the new Cabinet and Mr. Cameron, the leader of the Country Party, is- Minister for Commerce and the Navy.A General Coal Strike, originally called for the 1st March, began on the11th March. This results from the dissatisfaction of the miners&apos; leaders witha recent award of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and the failure of&quot; irritation tactics &quot; which have inconvenienced the men rather than owners. Ascoal reserves are high, industrial production will not be affected unless the strikeis prolonged, and the miners do not command the sympathy of the labour movement as a whole.6. Naval, Military and A ir Force A activities.(i) Navy. Eleven auxiliary mine-sweeping vessels are now in service and twoauxiliary anti-submarine vessels. The personnel of the Royal Australian Navynow totals 11,331, of whom 6,740 are on active service and the remainder in reserve.   134 merchant ships have now been defensively armed.   The Singapore
Civil authorities, in conjunction with the Naval authorities in Singapore, have requested the Commonwealth Naval Board to be prepared to supply immediatelyvery large quantities of provisions to Singapore in the event of certain eventualities. . .(ii) Army. The Prime Minister has announced that the second A.I.F. isto be expanded into an Army Corps by the recruitment of a second division. Thetotal strength would be brought up to 48,000. Recruiting for the additionaldivision and for the corps troops necessary will begin on the 1st May.The first quota of Militia (46,000) is now receiving three months&apos; training.The period for the second quota (30,000) will be from May to July. Some 25,000men have reported for enrolment under the Compulsory Service sections of theDefence Act, but 5,000 of these have been exempted for various reasons. 75 percent, of the stores necessary for the training of the Militia and for the secondA.I.F. have been delivered.A battalion of native infantry is being raised at Port Moresby, Papua,(iii) Air Force. Air Vice-Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, Inspector-Generalof tihe R.A.F., has arrived in Australia to take up his appointment as Chief ofthe Air Staff of the R.A.A.F. The Air Board has been reconstructed to consistof Chief of the Air Staff, Air Member for Organisation and Equipment, AirMember for Personnel, Director-General of Supply and Production, and FinanceMember.The fact that the Empire Air Scheme, as ultimately determined, providesfor the training of most of the Australian personnel in Australia rather thanoverseas meets with general favour. It is felt that the Scheme as now to be developed will not only permit of a more extensive Empire contribution by australia but have important permanent consequences to Australian air strength.Sixty-five Lockheed Hudson aircraft have been received from America and14 are on the way., In view of the possibility of enemy action, air patrols were carried out bythe R.A.A.F. to give air protection for the convoy of the First Echelon of theSecond A.I.F. and of the New Zealand Troops which left Sydney in January.During these operations an area of sea of some 500,000 square miles was searchedand approximately 45,000 miles flown.At the request of the French Government an officer of the Civil AviationDepartment is carrying out a survey for the establishment of a seaplane base atNoumea, New Caledonia. On completion of this survey, this officer will carry outsurveys at Vila, New Hebrides and Tulagi, Solomon Islands, to enable reliable information to be available if advanced bases should be required at those points for the flying boats of the Squadron stationed at Port Moresby, Papua.7. Legislative Action.There have been no particular developments.8. Economic Action.(i) Mamofacture of Munitions and A aircraft.- The orders received from theUnited Kingdom Ministry of Supply for munitions of various types are beginning to go into production, although they cannot be in full swing for some months.A shipment of rifles is expected to be ready shortly. The Commonwealth WarCabinet is considering whether it can release shipments of small arms ammunition, beginning shortly, thus giving United Kingdom requirementspriority over Australian requirements. Shell, cartridge cases and fuses for united Kingdom Government orders are in production.The production of explosives is being expanded. A factory is being established for the manufacture of 25-pounder Q.F. guns, 2-pounder Anti-tank guns and 3-inch trench mortars. The manufacture of Vickers machine guns isbeing organised, and requirements for India, New Zealand and the PacificIslands are being met. Manufacture of the Bren gun has begun, but fullmanufacture is not expected until about June. Depth charge throwers and smokefloats are being produced in quantity.Delivery of Tiger Moths is beginning, and the production of Wirrawayscontinues satisfactorily, 46 having been delivered.  Arrangements are being madefor the production of Trainers and Gipsy Major Engines.   The progress in theprogramme for the manufacture of Beaufort aircraft continues satisfactorily.[21075] B 2
(ii) Exchange and Import Control. It has been decided that the Companiesremitting film royalties in dollars should be subject to restriction. discussions are proceeding with these Companies to allow the transfer of 50 per cent, of theirAustralian earnings, provided that they can make arrangements satisfactory tothe Commonwealth Bank for the use of the remainder in Australia.Steps have been taken to bring under control Bank balances and deposits in non--sterling countries, and control of capital issues is being exercised morestringently.It has been decided that for the licensing period of two months ending the31st March licences are to be issued on the same basis as at present. A reductionof imports of Canadian and United States motor chassis during the next quota,year beginning the 1st May is under consideration. The motor trade has been consulted, but the degree of restriction to be imposed has not been finally determined.(iii) Wool. It is expected that substantial and increasing shipments willbe made to neutral markets. Shipments have been made or are being effected to japan, the United States and France, and also to Canada and India. The rapiddespatch of supplies overseas has minimised congestion in stores and relievedanxiety as to the provision for the storage of wool within the Commonwealth.(iv) Wheat. The latest estimates of the harvest are 190 million bushels.Difficulties are being experienced regarding storage. All facilities are being-utilised, but the position will not be relieved until arrangements are completedfor regular shipments overseas.There is widespread satisfaction that the United Kingdom Government hasfound it possible to commit itself to the purchase of the equivalent of 63 million bushels of new season&apos;s wheat on reasonable terms.A further offer by Japanese interests to purchase 50,000 tons of flour onextended credit terms has been refused.(v) Shipping and Shipbuilding.-Difficulty is still being experienced inobtaining shipping for wheat not purchased by the United Kingdom Governmentand also for exports of barley and timber.Following the announcement by the United Kingdom Government of theirpolicy of requisitioning, the Commonwealth Government appointed an OverseasShipping Committee consisting of one representative of the United KingdomMinistry of Shipping, one representative of the Commonwealth Government, and six representatives of the various shipping interests. It is the intention of theGovernment that the Committee shall advise it on all problems and questionsassociated with overseas shipping which the Government has to face.An investigation has begun into the extent to which Australia mightparticipate in the Empire war-time shipbuilding programme. Investigation will cover actual and potential capacity of Australian shipyards, changes in compara-tive costs of construction due to war-time conditions, probable Australianrequirements of merchant vessels, and similar questions. The enquiry is onlyin the preliminary stage at present.NEW ZEALAND.9. General Position.Mr. M. J. Savage, the Prime Minister, who has been in poor health followingan abdominal operation in August last, died on the 27th March.There have been no particular political developments.10. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.(i) Navy. Two more vessels have been defensively equipped. H.M.S.Leander is at Auckland having completed refit. H.M.S. Achilles is undergoingrefit at Auckland, where she arrived on the 23rd February. The whole ship&apos;scompany was accorded a tumultuous welcome and a civic reception, in whichrepresentatives of the Government participated. H.M.S. Hector arrived atAuckland on the 10th February and left on the 26th February with militaryreliefs for the garrison at Fanning Island.
Experiments are proceeding to determine the nature of magnetic fieldssurrounding typical vessels, including warships.(ii) Army. The technical units requested by the War Office (railway survey,railway construction and forestry) have entered camp for training. Arrange-ments are being made for 1,600 reinforcements to accompany the third echelonof the New Zealand Special Forces, and a further 2,000 to accompany the fourthreinforcement.   The normal three-monthly reinforcement thereafter will be 4,100.(iii) Air Force. Group Captain L. M. Isitt, R.N.Z.A.F., has been appointed the New Zealand representative on the Air Scheme Supervisory Board in Canada.The training of the Air Force continues at an expanding rate. The total numberselected to a recent date and passed as medically fit or temporarily unfit,respectively, is as follows : Pilots...............      764 and 223Observers       .........       ...      128 and   43Gunners        ............      200 and   68Twelve pilots have completed advanced training and will shortly be proceeding tothe United Kingdom. The building programme continues to be vigorously pushed forward.11. Legislative Action.An Emergency Regulation has been made prohibiting the making ofsubversive statements, which are defined to include statements causing disaffection,to interfere with the Forces, to prejudice recruiting or training of the Forces,to disrupt the national morale, to cause undue alarm, to cause unlawful resistance to the law, and to prejudice manufacture, production, output, supply and delivery,&amp;c. The Regulations also authorise the prohibition of all processions andmeetings likely to lead to a breach of the peace or to be used for subversive state-ments, and provide powers of investigation in connection with suspected payments for subversive activities.12. Economic Action.Shipments of wool and primary produce to the United Kingdom are proceeding satisfactorily. Petrol consumption in February under the rationing scheme was reduced to the monthly figure aimed at of approximately 6 million gallons.  It is not intended to intensify or ease the existing restrictions.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.13. General Position.As the result of the General Election of the Legislative Assembly in South-West Africa, the United Party has won 10 out of the 12 elective seats. This hasbeen interpreted by the English medium press as a rebuff for the parentNationalist Party in the Union.The Re-United Nationalist Party won the Kuriunan by-election by 3,255 votes to 2,452. The Government candidate polled 200 more votes than the Nationalistcandidate at the last general election. This defeat was expected, but it was hopedthat the majority would be smaller.The results of recent Provincial Council by-elections have been favourable to the Government. The voting strength of the opposition in Afrikaans-speakingareas has not been increased to anything like the extent which might have been expected to result from the defection of General Hertzog&apos;s followers and theiralliance with the Nationalists.14. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.Four additional mine-sweepers and two anti-submarine vessels are now beingfitted.Arrangements are being completed (a) to bind officers and men, who volunteerfor service in the defence of the Union both within and outside the borders of theUnion, by the completion of a new agreement of service and the administrationof a new oath, and (6).to extend the application of the military discipline code, ifnecessary, in territory beyond that laid down in the Defence Act.  . &apos; .      , .
The total strength of all branches of the forces (excluding commandos) isnow 2,480 officers and 52,100 other ranks. Five hundred Motor Transport driverstrained in Q services are now available for service.The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Middle East, recently visited the Union, and discussed various defence questions with the Union authorities.General Wavell was, in particular, authorised to discuss the possibility of the reinforcement of Kenya by the despatch of a Union brigade, and he reported as a result of his discussions that the Union Government would be prepared to despatch such a brigade equipped on a satisfactory scale from Union resources.The United Kingdom High Commissioner has been instructed to address a formalinvitation to the Union Government accordingly.In the light of his discussions General Wavell has also recommended that,in order to take advantage of the Unioirs potential air strength, steps shouldbe taken to enable Union air squadrons to move to Kenya by making availablemore modern equipment from this country.   This matter is under consideration.Arrangements have been made for Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Pop ham to visit the Union at about the end of April to discuss questions arisingout of the offer of the Union Government to provide air training facilities forpersonnel from the United Kingdom and other British territories outside theUnion. Sir Robert Brooke-Popham will also discuss the proposed move ofthree Union air squadrons to Kenya, plans for extending the coastal recon-naissance activities of the Union air forces, and the possibility of expediting the supply of material for these purposes.15. Legislative Action.The Minister of Finance has been empowered to appoint a custodian of enemy property and a controller of the property or business in the Union of aperson in Germany or of a German national. For the present it is not proposedto vest in the custodian all properties of German nationals or to control or manageall German properties or businesses; each case will be considered on its merits.The amount of information disclosed by the Union Censorship on theactivities of persons in neutral countries who are either (a) engaged in theendeavour to provide channels for trade between South Africa and enemy territory, (b) despatching subversive literature to the Union, or (c) seeking toestablish themselves as intermediaries for communications with Germany haspointed the need for a more rigorous examination of correspondence betweenSouth Africa, on the one hand, and the American Continent, Scandinavia and neutral countries contiguous to Germany, on the other. The examining staff has been increased to provide for an intensified examination of suchcorrespondence.16. Economic Action.The small arms ammunition factory is now producing at the rate of 48,000,000rounds per annum. Good progress is being made with building extensions toenable the production of tracer and armour piercing ammunition and Q.F.cartridge cases. A T.N.T. factory has been completed and production has com-menced. The erection of buildings for a bomb and shell-filling plant is in handand plant is now being shipped from England. Orders have been placed forthe manufacture in the Union of a total of 1,600 three-inch mortars at therate of 100 per month; 400 have been completed. Arrangements have been madeto produce 150,000,000 brass cups per annum for the War Office.EIRE.17. General Position.There have been no developments of importance.18. Naval, Military and Air Activities.The Naval Attache&quot; on the staff of the United Kingdom Representative to eire visited coast-watching stations in Donegal in the middle of March. Hereports the service as reasonably efficient and improving, the main defect being in the organization of communications.
NEWFOUNDLAND.21. General Position.The sixth anniversary of the introduction of the Commission form ofGovernment has been made the occasion for ventilating in the Press proposalsfor giving Newfoundlanders some constitutional voice in public affairs.The employment situation in Newfoundland continues to show improvement.In January 1940 the number of persons in receipt of relief was 52,549 and inFebruary 57,845, as compared with 69,403 and 75.447 for the correspondingmonths in 1939. .22. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.(i) Navy. The last batch of naval special service men and 275 general service men have either arrived or are en route. It is expected that the totalnumber of men so far asked for by the Admiralty (1,625) will have reached theUnited Kingdom by July. The Newfoundland Government are prepared tocontinue recruitment if more men are required by the Admiralty.(ii) Army. A party of Officers and N.C.Os. have proceeded to Newfound-land to take charge of the enlistment of 1,300 men for the Royal Artillery, andto escort the contingents to this country. Recruitment is proceeding and the firstbatch of 400 is expected to arrive here in April.(iii) Air Force. At the request of the Newfoundland Government, an approach has been made to the Government of Canada, and they have been askedto accept Newfoundland recruits for both initial and advanced training as pilots,observers and gunners.23. legislative Action.There is nothing special to report.24. Economic Action.At the request of the Ministry of Shipping, the Newfoundland Governmenthave agreed to recruit 300 to 400 deckhands in the first instance to man ships now under construction in the United Kingdom and ships about to be acquiredin the United States. These men will be employed by the shipping firms underordinary mercantile marine conditions, and will be entitled to repatriation at public expense at the end of the war or if incapacitated by sickness.The Civil Loggers&apos; Unit (2,100 men) are now getting to work, mainly in theNorth of Scotland, in producing pit-props for the mines. It is expected that thewhole unit will be in active production by the loth April.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.25. General Position.There are no developments to report.26. Military and Air Force Activities.(i) Army. Arrangements have now been completed for some 750 all ranks of the Rhodesia Regiinent to move about the middle of April to join selectedUnited Kingdom Units in the Middle East and the United Kingdom.   these the Eire Department of External Affairs have arranged that informationas to the presence of German submarines received from the coast-watching service shall be communicated immediately to the Office of the United Kingdom Repre-sentative, who will at once transmit it by telephone to the United KingdomGovernment.19. Legislative Action.There is nothing to report.20. Economic Action.There have been no developments of importance.
consist of some 450 Infantry, the remainder being Machine Gun, Artillery,Armoured Car, Engineer and Signals personnel.A Survey Unit is to move to East Africa.(ii) Air Force. The first batch of aircraft from the United Kingdom for the flying Training Schools which are being established in Southern Rhodesia was dueto reach Durban, en route for Southern Rhodesia, about the 15th March. The firstbatch of Southern Rhodesia pilots who have been receiving advanced training inthe Middle East have completed their training and have been posted toSquadrons.27. Legislative Action.Rent restriction regulations have been brought into force.28. Economic A ction.There is nothing to report.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.29. General Position.(i) Political Siluation.-The War Cabinet have at present under their consideration the general political situation in India and the policy to be adoptedwith respect to it. Since the date (the 11th March) of my memoranda submitted in that connexion the Indian National Congress has adopted without amendmentat its Ramgarh session held in the middle of the month the resolution framedfor its consideration by the Working Committee at Patna, thereby committingitself to an uncompromising demand for independence and to rejection ofDominion status or any other connexion with the Empire as the basis of Indianself-government. In answer to this resolution the All-India Moslem Leagueat its session held at Lahore adopted with acclamation on the 24th March aresolution defining the policy of the League as the partition of India regionallyinto &quot; independent States,&quot; connected apparently only by some loose form ofconfederation, if any, with the provision of &quot; adequate mandatory safeguards &quot;for minorities. In the Presidents address to the League he emphatically rejected as unsuited to India any form of democratic self-government which involvesmajority rule (including the federal provisions of the Government of India Act)on the ground that this would mean the subjection of the Moslems, who heclaimed constituted a separate nation and not a mere minority, to the domination of Hindus.I am now awaiting, for submission to the War Cabinet, the Governor-GeneraTs further appreciation of the present position in the light of these developments.The political events in Sind to which I referred in my last report have resulted in the resignation of the Ministry, and the Governor has appointed anew Ministry consisting of four Moslems and two Hindus said to represent the newly constituted &apos;&apos; Nationalist&apos;&apos; Party under the Premiership of one of theprevious Ministers. The new Ministry was to meet the Legislature for the first time on the 26th March, the date fixed for its re-assambly after the prorogationfor a few days which for technical reasons the Governor had found necessary.I have reported separately to the War Cabinet regarding the Caxton Hallcrime on the 13th March.(ii) Law and order. A number of Communist leaders (have been arrested and detained under the Defence of India Rules by order of the CentralGovernment.A serious riot occurred in Lahore on the 19th March. A body of Khaksars(a Moslem para-military organisation), largely from another Province, defiedthe orders of the Punjab Government forbidding drill and the carrying of arms.The police, after warning, resisted them and two constables and twenty-sixKhaksars were killed. Order was quickly restored. A comparatively moderateresolution was passed by the Moslem League conference at Lahore, and the punjab Government have declared the organisation illegal. Apart from thisno serious consequences have so far declared themselves.
32. Indian States.No important new developments in the States have been reported. In thecourse of the session of the Chamber of Princes under the presidency of the Viceroyat New Delhi, which has just concluded, the two following resolutions were passed: &quot; (1) The Chamber of Princes requests His Excellency the crown representative kindly to place before His Imperial Majesty The KingEmperor the firm determination of the Ruling Princes and Chiefs of India[21075] cThe War Office have now accepted the offer of the Government of Indiato place a Division, organised on a two brigade basis, at the disposal of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, They ask that this Division should also include one ofthe two additional brigade groups already prepared for service overseas. Theseformations were referred to in W.P. (R.) (39) 66 and W.P. (R.) (39) 32,respectively.The Division, which is to be earmarked for the defence of the Anglo-IranianOilfields, will thus include three infantry brigades. The composition of the division, apart from the Infantry, is under discussion.The Government of India have undertaken to erect, at the expense of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, an extension to their factories in India for the productionof 12 million rounds a month of small arms ammunition, in addition to theoutput of their own expanded factories.31. Foreign and Frontier Relations.(i) Afghanistan. The views of the Government of India have now beenreceived as to the reply to be made to the Afghan Prime Ministers request for a clear definition of the attitude and action of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the event of a Russian attack on Afghanistan. A memorandum making certain proposals on this subject is being circulated.(ii) North-West Frontier.-Successes against gangs in the Districts havehad a good effect in Waziristan proper where incidents have recently been fewer.In North Waziristan hostiles are believed to have suffered heavy casualties inan encounter with Scouts in the vicinity of Boya on the 16th March. In SouthWaziristan Government officers are again using roads which have been closedf for some considerable time.The operations in the Ahmadzai Salient are proceeding steadily. Fourpickets have been established beyond Daryobe (about the centre of the Salient)without difficulty. The hostiles are now believed to number under 300 and tobe scattered in various places towards the western end of the Salient.In Bannu District a bad outrage occurred on the 7th March when a gangambushed a passenger motor lorry and several passengers were killed. Therehave also been one or two kidnapping cases, but a general improvement in thesituation in the Bannu District is now reported as a result of recent successesof the Frontier Constabulary against hostile gangs. On the 3rd March on the borders of Dera Ismail Khan district the Frontier Constabulary repulsed a gangof 200 and inflicted casualties of 10 killed, including two important leaders,and a number wounded. On the 10th March they surrounded a large gangin the south of Bannu District and punished them severely, killing at leastnine, before they got away. On the following day the same gang was againintercepted by Regular troops and Frontier Constabulary and lost sixteen menkilled and five captured, besides a number of wounded. Our casualties were two wounded, one of whom, Mr. Fryer of the Indian Police Service, has sincedied of his wounds.The rest of the Frontier remains quiet. Enlistment for five new Afridiplatoons recently authorised for the Frontier Constabulary has been very keen.(iii) Persian Gulf. a possibility of local trouble on the Trucial Coastbetween the forces of the Sheikhs of Sharjah and Debai has been averted forthe time being by the conclusion of a three months&apos; truce between the twoSheikhs.   The armed forces of both are returning to their towns.
to render every possible assistance in men, money and material to HisImperial Majesty and his Government in their heroic struggle for upholdingthe cause of justice and for maintaining the sacredness of treaties andconvenants and prays that the united efforts of the Empire and the Alliesmay lead to the early and triumphant vindication of the high principles for which His Imperial Majesty has been forced to take up arms againstthe enemies.&quot;&quot; The Chamber of Princes, while welcoming attainment by India ofits due place amongst the Dominions of the British Commonwealth underthe British Crown, records its emphatic and firm view : (a) that in any future Constitution for India the essential guarantees and safeguards forthe preservation of the sovereignty and autonomy of the States and forthe protection of their rights arising from Treaties. Sanads, Engagementsor otherwise, should be effectively provided, and that any unit should notbe placed in a position to dominate the others or to interfere witn therights and safeguards guaranteed to them, and that all parties must be ensured their due share and fair play: (b) that in any negotiations forformulating a Constitution for India, whether independently of the Govern-ment of India Act, 1935, or by revision of that Act, the representatives ofthe States and of this Chamber should have a voice proportionate to their importance and historical position.&quot; (2) This Chamber further records its view that any constitutionalscheme which may involve the transference of the relationship of the states with the Crown to any other authority without their free and voluntary agreement, or which may permit of alterations affecting the rights and interests of the States without their consent, cannot be acceptable to them.&quot;The King has caused to be communicated to the Chancellor of the Chamber,in acknowledgment of the first resolution, His Majesty&apos;s profound appreciation of the loyal sentiments of the Princes and Chiefs of India and of the generositywhich has prompted their offers of assistance.33. Economic Affairs.(i) Civil Supply. The supply of sandbags by the Indian jute industry was found to be in excess of the present need, and the Ministry of Supply asked inJanuary that the rate of delivery of sandbags should be cut down by half. Theorders so far received by the Indian jute mills for jute cloth for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were also practically completed. As a result the hours of work inthe mills, which, in order to meet the increased demands at the outbreak of war,were increased gradually from 40 to 60 per week, have quite recently beenreduced to 54 per week. The price of raw jute has been showing a substantialdecline, no doubt as a consequence of the decline in Government orders and thereduction in hours of work, and the receipt of a new order from the Ministry ofSupply for 52 million yards of jute cloth has not checked the decline.Although jute occupies a special place among the products of India, thereare others which are important for the purpose of war supplies. The Ministryof Food, for instance, are purchasing very large quantities of tea (330 million lbs.)and oilseeds and oilcake (up to 1^ million tons), and the Ministry of Supplycotton goods, such as khaki drill and cotton duck, blankets and other textiles.A request for cellular cotton cloth for underclothing could not be met to the specification desired as such material was not made in India. But a reasonablyclose substitute was evolved for which substantial orders have been placed.Owing to the extreme shortage of flax, a material was required for water-holdingstores, and a substitute cotton and jute fabric was evolved which gives promise of great utility. If it comes up to expectations, the Ministry of Supply are likelyto require at least 6 million j^ards. The whole of India&apos;s exportable surplus of wool is now sent to this country, and also large quantities of Indian semi-tannedleather, which is required here for the manufacture of Army boots. Arrange-ments are also being made under which practically the whole of India&apos;s out-turnof high-grade mica suitable for aeroplanes and munitions purposes will come tothis country.
-India has for some time been maintaining the Army in the Near and far east in clothing and general stores. This includes a considerable out-turn ofboots. Quite recently the Government of India have undertaken to supply inaddition, to the order of the Ministry of Supply, by the end of the year, a millionpairs of boots, subject to the necessary accessories being sent from Europe.Another order from the Ministry of Supply is for considerable quantities ofcarbonized coconut shell, which is needed for the production of activated charcoalfor gas masks. In view of the shortage of soft timber in this country, the Govern-ment of India have offered to create an organisation to produce up to 15,000 tonsa month.Under arrangements made with the Ministry of Supply, large quantities of pig iron are to be supplied to this country, as well as quantities of finished steel,e.g., steel huts, to Egypt and other countries, to relieve supplies and shipping from the United Kingdom.The Indian Supply Department is also arranging supplies for other empire governments, and at the request of the Admiralty they are supplying electriccables for demagnetising ships against the magnetic mine.An enquiry by the Admiralty as to the capacity of India to build sea-goingtugs of about 500 tons has shown that there are shipyards in India capable of doing so.This brief statement takes no account of supplies of a distinctly military character, such as munitions, which are also being manufactured in largequantities to meet external requirements.(ii) Exchange control. New regulations came into force on the 25th March,under which all exports of jute, jute manufactures and rubber from India to alist of countries including practically the whole of America, Belgium, theNetherlands and Switzerland must result in the acquisition, by the Control, of dollars, belgas, guilders or Swiss francs. Thus the substantial sums yielded by such exports, which have hitherto tended to be lost on the free market, will infuture be available for essential purchases abroad.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.34. General Position.The Defence of Burma Ordinance and the Rules thereunder (c/. W.P. (R.)(39) 6, paragraph 2) were re-enacted on the 29th February without substantial change as a Governor&apos;s Act to be in force for the duration of the war and sixmonths thereafter. No comment whatsoever has been aroused in the Press bythis step.During this period propaganda articles of purely Burmese origin and notowing their inspiration to British influence have for the first time appeared in the burmese Press exposing Nazi methods in Germany; they are reported to havebeen well received.The Federal Council of Shan Chiefs has recommended that an allotment bemade from the Federal Fund of  40,000 to be offered to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment as a contribution towards the cost of the war. This, together with thespecial war funds raised by individual States, means a total contribution fromthe Federation and the component States of  57,000- 60,000. The Shan Chiefsoriginally proposed to contribute  100,000, but this was so clearly beyond theFederation&apos;s financial resources that the Governor secured its reduction to  40,000.There is, once more, nothing to report under the usual specific heads.[21075]
Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only Colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories, and&quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners and theBritish Resident, Zanzibar.)General Report.35. Defence and Man-Power Questions.(i) Defence Policy of Malaya. The defence policy of Malaya has recentlybeen reviewed by the Oversea Defence Committee as a result of representations by the Governor that the R.A.F. strength in Singapore should be increased. TheGovernor also referred to the difficulty of giving adequate training to thelocal volunteer forces without dislocating the economic life of Malaya. Thiswould be detrimental to the production of rubber and tin, which are vital to theEmpire&apos;s war effort from two points of view : not only are the tin and rubberthemselves essential materials, but their sale to neutral countries, particularly the United States of America, affords a most valuable source of foreign currency.It has not proved possible to meet the Governors wishes by increasing thestrength of the R.A.F. in Singapore. Indeed, circumstances have recentlynecessitated the withdrawal of two squadrons from Singapore to India (meetingof War Cabinet held on the 20th March, 1940, W.M. (40) 73rd Conclusions,Minute 9). The Governor has been asked to collaborate with the General OfficerCommanding with a view to the working out of a system for the training of thelocal forces, which will improve their efficiency without appreciably reducing theoutput or jeopardising the marketing of tin and rubber. He has also been askedto consider further the enactment of compulsory service legislation. approval for the introduction of such legislation was given last year, but no further steps were taken in Malaya.(ii) African Colonial Forces. It has now been decided that one battalion ofthe King&apos;s African Rifles should be moved, as soon as possible, from Kenya toSomaliland. A further battalion and battery are earmarked to proceed from kenya to Somaliland if relations with Italy deteriorate, and a brigade group isearmarked to proceed to Basra in the event of a threat of war with Russia. Thishas necessitated the reinforcement of Kenya in order that, if these further movestake place, the security of East Africa may not be jeopardised. As a result of a visit by the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to East and South Africa a requesthas been addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South africa to despatch a brigade group of troops from the Union. The Commander-in-chief has also recommended that a contingent of the Royal West African Frontier force should be transferred from West Africa to Kenya, in addition to the SouthAfrican troops, and this suggestion is now under consideration.36. Co-operation with the French Colonial Office.in the middle of the month I paid a visit to Paris for a three-day conference with M. Mandel, the French Colonial Minister.Discussions were conducted in an atmosphere of great cordiality and usefulresults were achieved. The first, and most important, decision was that eachMinister should appoint a liaison officer in his own Office to keep in constanttouch with the other Office, to visit it from time to time and to arrange directcontacts between the administrative and technical officers of the two Offices.It Avas agreed that this contact at headquarters should be supplemented bydix^ect contacts between British and French Colonial Governors in various partsof the world and periodical conferences between them.Advantage was taken of my visit to make further arrangements for collabora-tion in the economic sphere, and my Agricultural Adviser established a contact with his colleague in the French Ministry, which is likely to have useful results.Direct contact between my Medical Adviser and his French colleague is alsocontemplated.
Emphasis was laid throughout on the fact that, although it was primarilythe war which led to collaboration between the two Offices, there was everyintention of continuing it in time of peace.37. Economic Measures.(i) Exchange Control. The scheme for obtaining control of the foreign exchange proceeds of sales of tin and rubber abroad was duly put into effect duringthe month of March as arranged.(ii) Export Licensing. The volume of work in this connection continues to grow, but no important new developments of general application have arisenduring the last month.(iii) Import Licensing. Telegraphic instructions have now been sent toColonial Governments (other than the Government of Palestine and the Govern-ments of the territories lying in the Congo Basin) to the effect that importlicences for French imports should be issued either freely and without limit,or up to 100 per cent, of pre-war imports.(iv) Supply of Colonial Products to the united Kingdom and France. Difficulties in connection with the marketing of cocoa and, to a lesser extent,oil-seeds, arising chiefly out of the considerable surplus production of these commodities in the British and French Empires over Allied requirements, continueto engage my attention. As regards cocoa, it is provisionally estimated thatan unsold balance of 160,000 tons may have to be taken over by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment at the end of the current marketing season; but possible ways of reducing this surplus are being actively explored. The position of oil-seedsgenerally for the Colonial Empire is also being reviewed as a result of the growing excess over the Ministry of Food&apos;s requirements of supplies of palmkernels from West Africa and of copra from a number of Dependencies. liaison with the French Government, to which further reference is made elsewhere, isbeing maintained in connection with the marketing of these two importantColonial products.There is little to report in regard to the remaining Colonial commodities.The French Government have made some purchases of East African cotton forexchange reasons; arrangements are now almost completed for the purchase by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the whole output of Sea Island cotton fromthe West Indies for Air Ministry purposes; arrangements for the purchase bythe Ministry of Food of the available (very small) supplies of Malayan teaare nearly completed. Sir Willian Lead, head of the Tanganyika AgriculturalDelegation, has returned to East Africa after a fortnights visit to this country,during which he was able to review the arrangements for maintaining suppliesof East African sisal for Allied requirements and certain other matters affectingthe production and trade of Tanganyika. The delegation representing kenya and Uganda is still pursuing enquiries in London.(v) Shipping. The shipping difficulties mentioned in my report last monthstill remain; but thanks to the assistance of the Ministry of Shipping it hasbeen possible to relieve the position somewhat in some places, e.g., Palestine. TheEast African Trade Delegation mentioned in (iv) above is carrying on discus-sions with tihe Ministry of Shipping regarding the difficulties which are atpresent being experienced in that part of the Colonial Empire and otherindividual matters (e.g., a complaint from the Governor of the Straits Settle-ments about the provision of shipping space on homeward journeys from singapore) are being taken up with the Ministry.(vi) Supply of Food-stuffs to the Colonies. There has been no important new development in the situation under this head.(vii) Restriction of Food Imports into the United Kingdom. The arrange-ments introduced by the Minister of Food on the 19th March for the import licensing of a large number of food-stuffs, including food-stuffs from Colonialsources, have caused some concern to Colonial Governments and others interestedin the Colonial export trade to this country. No measures will be taken whichwill have the effect of dislocating existing trade, and I have proposed that thewhole question should be discussed between the Ministry of Food and repre-sentatives of the Colonial Office, with a view to avoiding the dislocation ofexisting trade and the preservation, so far as circumstances allow, of theprinciples generally followed so far as admitting Colonial produce freely.
Reports on Particular Colonies.38. Somaliland: Disarmament of the Somali Tribes.Governors The calling in of unregistered arms was referred to in section 6 of theNo.r59ofSram February report, Information has now been received from the Governor to theMnrch 27, effect that two sections of the Habr Toljaala tribe, from whom some opposition1940- bad been expected, have been successfully disarmed without incident, and that asa result others are handing in their rifles. The Governor therefore, feels that thesuccess of the disarmament policy is assured, provided it is continued carefullybut diligently.39. Northern Rhodesia: Strikes of Copper-mine Workers.Govemor-s A strike of European employees was declared at the Mufulira Copper MineNtT 71 &quot;of on t^e 18th March. The Union presented a number of demands to the CompanyMarch is, covering rates of wages and conditions of emplo3ment. The native employees1940- did not strike, but were rendered idle by the strike of the European mine workers.The strike spread on the 21st March to the Nkana and Nchanga Mines.Officers of the Northern Rhodesia Government, including the LabourCommissioner, have been endeavouring to effect a settlement between the twoGovernors parties; and on the 26th March the Governor, who had himself flown to theNo^sTof Copperbelt, reported that conciliation proceedings had ended satisfactorily, thatMarch 26, a settlement had been accepted by the men, and that work would recommence on15M0- the following day.   It is understood that agreement was reached between thetwo parties on all the points raised by the Mining Union, with the exceptionof a demand for a 2s. increase in wages per shift.  It was agreed that this shouldbe submitted to arbitration.Governor^ On the 29th March the Governor reported that a further strike had brokenNo^Tof out&apos; fckis time among the native employees at the Mufulira and Nkana mines.March 29, The strikers are demanding greatly increased rates of pay. They are picketing19-10. the streets and are adopting intimidating tactics.   In these circumstances the governors Governor has approved the despatch of two companies of the Northern RhodesiaNo^sTof Regiment, one to Nkana to supplement the police force there and one to Mufulira.April i, The Secretary for Native Affairs is on the Copperbelt endeavouring to effect1940 a settlement.  Everything is reported to be quiet at the other mines, where work is proceeding as usual.40. West Indies.Proposals are under consideration for schemes for relief expenditure fromthe special sum of  350,000 which Parliament will be asked to provide for theWest Indies. Expenditure has already been approved in some cases to be met from Colony funds in the first instance, on the understanding that refunds upto the amount approved for each colony will be made from the special provisionif this is approved by Parliament.Governors  2,600 has been subscribed in Trinidad and Tobago to a relief fund fortelegram British West Indian seamen and their dependants who are left in want as aMarch924f direct result of enemy action. The appeal originated with the loss of twenty-six1940.  &quot; &apos;       West Indian seamen in the British tanker Inverdargle.41. Cyprus.The economic situation, which has been causing some anxiety owing to shipping difficulties, &amp;c, has provided local politicians with opportunities forsome political agitation, and it is probably at their instigation that a number ofTrade Unionists attempted a general strike towards the close of February in sympathy with a small strike of mechanics and electricians in Nicosia. TheGovernor dealt firmly with this attempt, which was limited to twenty-four hours-and made no impression on the general life of the community. According to thelatest reports the present position is normal.The intention to resume municipal elections, which have been suspended sincethe political troubles of 1931, has been announced.
It is hoped that a solution may soon be reached of the difficult problemcreated by the long-existing vacancy in the Archiepiscopal See of Cyprus.Election to this vacancy has been delayed by the reluctance of the Bishop ofPaphos, who is himself ineligible for election under existing legislation, to relinquish his present jxisition as Locum Tenens. An added complication is thenecessity for obtaining the assistance of some other Greek Orthodox Church inthe formation of an electoral Synod. It is, however, proposed to enact legislation which will compel the holding of an election provided that it is possible, with theconcurrence and assistance of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to securethe co-operation of the Patriarch of Alexandria in the formation of a Synod.The election, if held, is likely to cause considerable political excitement in Cyprus,as the Church and, in particular, the Locum Tenens personally, have taken a leading part in keeping alive what is known as the &quot; Enosis &quot; movement, i.e., an agitation for the union of Cyprus with Greece. But the settlement of thisquestion is now considered very desirable on every ground.42. Ceylon.The Board of Ministers in Ceylon, who resigned on the 27th February onthe occasion of a disagreement with the Governor in a matter concerning thePolice Department, agreed on the 16th March to resume their Ministries. Theposition is thus again normal.43. Malaya.The Sultan of Brunei, a small Malay State in the island of Borneo, whocontributed $100,000 (about  12,000) last year towards the cost of ImperialDefence, has presented to His Majesty&apos;s Government a further similar sum, onthe occasion of his Coronation, as a contribution towards the prosecution of thr,war.A Chinese, long resident in the State of Negri Sembilan, Federated malay states, has offered to lend $100,000 ( 12,000 approximately) to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment without interest for the duration of the war, and in reporting this offer the High Commissioner for the Malay States indicated that others of asimilar nature were likely to follow.44. Hong Kong.The Legislative Council has resolved to contribute to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment from the proceeds of special war taxation two minesweeping vessels, fourharbour defence vessels, and two army ferry tenders (to be locally constructedat an estimated cost of Hong Kong $5,000,000 ( 312,000)). It was also decidedto offer to His Majesty&apos;s government a gift of  100,000 in cash as a contributionto war expenditure.45. Aden Protectorate.In the report for December 1939 reference was made to the murder by Arabtribesmen at Irqa, a village on the shore of the Gulf of Aden, of the crew of a royal Air Force bombing machine which made a forced landing after engaging in punitive air action against another section of the tribe. Substantial fines ofmoney and rifles have been paid by the tribesmen in the area concerned following upon visits by the Political Secretary at Aden. A temporary inter-tribal trucehas been signed in this lawless district, and every effort is being made by the protectorate authorities to promote some effective Arab administrative organisa-tion amongst the local tribesmen.In the Eastern Protectorate there has been intermittent unrest amongst theHamumi tribes, who occupy a large territory between the coast and the maintownships of the Hadhramaut. The Hamumi are a traditionally turbulent people,and recent reports have shown that their present hostile attitude towards theQu&apos;aiti Sultan of Mukalla and his British Resident Adviser is being assisted by money and arms furnished at the expense of one Salih Bin Abdat in theHadhramaut township of Al Ghurfa. The Resident Adviser himself is in theHadhramaut and endeavouring to impose terms on Bin Abdat. Instructions havebeen sent to the Governor at Aden that if Bin Abdat remains obdurate in hisdefiance of the local authorities, forcible action should be taken to apprehend him and to secure communications between the Hadhramaut and the sea.
High Com- Jewish demonstrations against the Land Transfers Regulations, which hadmissioned ^    been published on the 28th February, took place daily between the 2nd and theissfiss  i90,OS&apos; ^th March.   These demonstrations were restricted to Jerusalem, Haifa, Tel Aviv202! 207 and    and Petah Tiqvah, and elsewhere the country was generally quiet.  In those townsl30rOh 9        during the course of the demonstrations, the troops and police were stoned,19409       &apos;    barricades were erected, and attempts were made to damage and destroy Govern-ment buildings.   The situation became sufficiently serious to necessitate theimposition of curfew, at one time or another, in each of the four towns in question.During this period six soldiers and police were seriously injured and 21slightly injured.    Seventy-four Jews were seriously injured (of whom twosubsequently died) and 323 were slightly injured.  One hundred and forty arrestswere made.Mass demonstrations were held in Jerusalem, Haifa and Tel Aviv on the7th March, the day following the debate on the Regulations in the House ofCommons, but since that date no further incidents of importance have occurred.Apart from these short-lived disorders immediately connected with the issue ofthe Regulations, the improvement in the general security situation throughoutthe country was fully maintained during the month.High Com- Shortly before Easter Sir Harold MacMichael left for a brief holiday inte&apos;ieSiramr&apos;S Syria and the Lebanon, during which he repaid the courtesy visit which the HighNo^saToi Commissioner for Syria and the Lebanon had paid him in Jerusalem inMarch is,      November last.1940.
