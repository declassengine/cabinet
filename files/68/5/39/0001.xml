In the margin beside the items are placed percentage figures showing their comparative importancein relation to the total propaganda directed to (1) the German home popula-tion; (2) Great Britain; (3) France; and (4) neutral countries. In bracketsafter each figure is shown the corresponding percentage for the previousfortnight.A table is then given indicating the relative importance of these variouslines of propaganda.The dominating event during the current fortnight was the Altmarkincident. This has been the most important event for German propagandasince the early days of the war.The principal lines of German propaganda were, in order of their importance:  1. British brutality and unscrupulousness.2. British weakness.3. German strength.4. Military operations.10813-5   [20985] b
The most important change was the displacement of British weaknessby British brutality as the dominating theme, due entirely to the Altmarkincident. This latter theme occupied the extraordinary proportion of nearly one-third of the total of German propaganda. The decline in other themes,especially of British weakness and social propaganda, was merely a reflectionof this change.1. German Strength.Germany, 151% (13%)        The relative importance of this theme within the general pattern ofFrance&apos; 11% (Uj%)  German propaganda has remained unaltered.   Germany&apos;s economic strengthNeutrals,I4j% (15%) continues to be the most prominent sub-theme, except in propaganda for theGerman home population, where it was overshadowed by the friendship ofItaly and by Germany&apos;s military and internal political strength.As in the previous fortnight, the stress has been laid upon the Fcusso-German Trade Agreement and upon the barter system of economy.Germany&apos;s trade relations with the North, East and South of Europe remainundisturbed, and she is, therefore, immune to the blockade.Far more attention has been paid to the support of Italy than duringthe previous fortnight. Cultural ties were given scarcely less prominencethan community of economic interest. The German-Italian Trade agreement was treated even more as a political than as an economic event. &quot; The Italo-German Cultural Committee will pave the way for spiritual relations evenmore profound.&quot;Herr Hitler&apos;s speech was made the occasion for increased emphasis onthe military strength and internal unity of Germany.It is of interest that German propaganda books and pamphletsemphasise the theme of German strength more than do the press and wireless.2. Military Operations.Germany,ii% (151%) This theme has declined considerably in propaganda to the homeFrance&apos;l\ ^6%)     population and to neutrals.The sinking of ships remains the most important item. Prominencewas given to total losses rather than to individual sinkings. There has beena great increase in the attention paid to the destruction of Allied aircraft and to German reconnaissance flights over France and the North Sea. Itwas stated that, whereas British aircraft flew over Germany in darkness andat great heights, German aeroplanes constantly raided both Britain andFrance in broad daylight.3. Neutrals Oppose Allies.German treatment of the Altmark incident concentrated so exclusivelyupon British brutality that little time was wasted upon the consequenthostility of neutral States. No great stress was laid upon the Norwegianprotest to Great Britain.Use was again made of the indignation of the United States at thecensoring of her mail at Bermuda.Germany, 21% (3%)Britain, 21% (21%)prance, 31% (2%)Neutrals, 4% (21%)4. British Weakness.Germany, 171%(22%) Owing to the Altmark incident this theme has dropped to second placeBritain,23j% (3ii%) for the first time since the beginning of the year. It has declined inNeutrals i6i%^(23%) importance by nearly one-third over the previous fortnight.Britain&apos;s economic weakness has returned to its paramount position.Shortage of shipping was said to have caused her to cut down her imports,to slaughter her livestock and to purchase neutral tonnage at inflated prices.The adaptation by the Financial News of Herr Hitler&apos;s slogan : &quot; Exportor Die &quot; to British conditions was eagerly exploited.Interest in dissensions in the British Empire, though declining, was still at a high level. The I.R.A. outrages and Mr. de Valera&apos;s demand forthe union of all Ireland were given full publicity. The only other items ofimportance were the fighting on the North-West frontier and the activitiesof the Indian Congress.
The favourite topic of British social weakness has suffered severely fromconcentration on the Altmark incident. Interest, however, was maintained in the hardships of old-age pensioners and the dependents of soldiers and sailors.-t Tory M.P.,&quot; a book published in England some months before the war,has been discovered by the German Propaganda Ministry and quoted at considerable length. It was thereby demonstrated that money rules theBritish Parliament, that 181 M.P.S hold 775 directorships, and that the&quot; unscrupulous British plutocrat Chamberlain,&quot; revealed as the main share-holder, exploited the British railways for his own profit.British decadence was clearly proved by the prevalence of nudity uponthe stage, which, moreover, was ill-paid.In spite of the general decline in the theme of British weakness, therehas been an increase in the attention paid to British military and navalweakness. Britain can no longer protect either her own or neutral commerce&apos;. .The whole course of the war has, indeed, been so unsatisfactory that theBritish Ministry of Lies has been forced to evolve peace plans in order tomaintain the morale of the population.It is of interest that in propaganda for home consumption Britishinternal political weakness has always been neglected.5. French Weakness.Like the theme of British weakness, this has suffered severely from the ^itah^n^ (4&quot;&apos;&apos;Pdeflection of interest to the Altmark incident.    The loss, however, was prauoe,&apos;5i% (W%)confined entirely to French internal political and social weakness.  Emphasis Neutrals, oi% (6i%)upon her military weakness has increased, and the greatest doubt was castupon the morale and equipment of the French army.French internal political weakness, illustrated by the dictatorship ofDaladier and the muzzling of public opinion, continued to be the mostimportant sub-division of this theme in propaganda to France.In propaganda to Great Britain most attention was paid to France&apos;military weakness.6. British Brutality and Unscrupulousness.The spectacular increase in this theme, amounting to nearly 60 per cent. Germany, 35% (24%)over the previous fortnight, is entirely due to the German exploitation of the France&apos;30% (15*%)Altmark incident.   This incident was given far greater publicity than any Neutrals, 30* % (19%)other event since the conquest of Poland.   For four days the Altmarkpractically monopolised German propaganda.The incident was treated along three major lines :- (a) British brutality to German seamen, a point stressed most strongly to Germany.(b) The outrage to Norwegian neutrality, which was given specialprominence ^broadcasts to neutral countries.(c) Britain has shown once more that, where her interests are at stake.international law does not exist.Three subordinate lines were then developed. These were : firstly, that britain had lied in stating that the Germans fired first, and about the crueltreatment of prisoners; secondly, that the incident illustrated the desire of britain and France to extend the war to Scandinavia; and, thirdly, that britain had so far lost the command of the seas that she could carry out suchan operation only in neutral waters. The existence of British prisoners onboard the A it mark was scarcely mentioned in the earlier stages.There were signs that this propaganda was allowed to develop beyondcontrol. One broadcast to England began with the statement that there hadbeen nothing comparable in British history to the Altmark incident sinceNelson&apos;s brutal attack on Copenhagen and ended by pointing out that theBritish navy had dishonoured the Nelson tradition.&quot;In accordance with the usual technique, the Altmark incident was represented as only one in a historic series of crimes. It was compared withthe Barralong incident in the last war, and with the machine-gunning of the[20965] B 2

It was asserted that the deed inJoessing Fjord was the most shameful crime ever committed by any nation,and that the British flag would forever bear the stain of Churchill&apos;s crime.In dealing with this incident German propaganda excelled itself in theviolence of its language.Although all topics were subordinated to the Altmark. prominence wasgiven to neutral shipping losses, which were ascribed as usual to GreatBritahVs account, to the searching of mails, and to Britain&apos;s economicespionage.After some hesitation, it was decided that the British Secret service had murdered Sir Charles Cayser. M.P.. on account of his pacifist views.7. French Brutality and Unscrupulousness.The main charge against France continues to be that she desires, togetherwith Great Britain, to extend the war to Scandinavia and the Balkans. Theactivities of General Weygand in the Near East were again followed with interest.The injury done by France to neutral countries is still given littleprominence, although the applause of the French Press in connection withthe Altmark incident was criticised.Oppression in the French colonies is becoming established as a minorbut constant topic.8. Britain Lies.It is of interest that the main items in this theme showed Germany onthe defensive. It was emphasised that the Altmark prisoners were notill-treated, that they had pastries at Christmas, and that they were evenable to save butter, owing to the self-sacrificing generosity of their captors.The suggestion that U-boat commanders had acted in a brutal manner,or that German aircraft had fired upon lifeboats, was a malicious lie.Mr. Churchill&apos;s admission of damage to the Barham and the Nelsonwas seized upon as a proof that Great Britain had concealed her navallosses.This theme has shown less variation than any other during the lasttwo months.9. France Lies.The main accusation against France is that she misrepresents conditionsinside Germany. Her statements that prisoners are badly treated, thatthe workers are slaves or that the Nazi leaders are quarrelling amongstthemselves are shown to be ridiculous.Rumours of troop movements in the Protectorate and elsewhere werestupid and malicious lies.German propaganda has always played the theme of French mendacityto French audiences rather than to other countries.10. Allied War Guilt.Although the figures representing the relative importance of this themehave been consistently lower for Germany than for Great Britain and France,greater stress has been laid upon British War Guilt, throughout the monthsof October, November, December, January and February, than upon anyother theme in the Confidential Party Leads issued to speakers and editors.Much greater importance has been attached to War Guilt inside germany in forms of propaganda which cannot be numerically estimated.The most important charge is that the Allies wanted and precipitatedthe war, and that they refused Hitler&apos;s peace offer on the 6th October, 1939.Britain declared war out of envy of Germany&apos;s social progress and economic prosperity.11. Allied War Aims.This theme, like nearly allattention devoted to the AItmark.on the &quot; Westphalia complex.&quot;Minister, where the Treaty of Westphalia was signedothers, has suffered severely from the propaganda has continued to concentrateDr.  Goebbels, for example, spoke at

German War A ims.Herr Hitler&apos;s speech alone was responsible for the emergence of thistheme from the total obscurity of the previous fortnight.   Germany, it was said, demands Lebensraum and colonies, and desires to free the whole world Neutrals, 1% (-)from English injustice, terror and hypocrisy.German War Aims, however, remain imprecise in  definition andnegligible in importance.13. Britain Exploits France.The usual charges were maintained. Britain is said to exerciseeconomic domination over France. Mr. Hore-Belisha was reported to have written that English workers should continue to labour in factories whilefighting Germany to the last available Frenchman.The alleged order of Lord Gort, recommending British soldiers to avoidmarriage with French women, was well exploited.A German leaflet dropped in France on the 23rd February illustrated the traditional Anglo-French hostility by pictures of the burning of Joan ofArc, the Burghers of Calais in 1347, Napoleon at St. Helena guarded by aBritish sentry, and a British soldier inciting a French Poilu to attack the siegfried Line. The German &quot;Journal de Cambronne,&quot; printed for french soldiers, concentrated upon this theme in February more even thanin January.14.

Anti-Semitism.This theme continues to be an undercurrent rather than a distinct line Germany,2j% (2%)of propaganda.  The point is continually made that the Allied Governments ^1*^6&apos;2%%a?o%)are merely the tools of Jewish Capitalist finance. Neutrals, 1% (*%)These sixteen themes constitute the main lines of German propaganda.The following individual points, however, deserve mention :  (a) Great stress has been laid upon German reconstruction in Poland, asan antidote to charges of persecution.(b) Charges of &quot; unneutrality&quot;  against the neutrals have further increased in violence. Close attention has been paid to theneutral, and especially to the Swiss, Press.(c) The idea of an &quot; Eurasian &quot; economic bloc, comprising Germany,Italy, Russia and Japan, was once more ventilated.(d) There has been an increase in the justification of attacks uponneutral and Allied merchant shipping.[over
