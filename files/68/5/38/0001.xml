this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).secret.P.   (R)  (ho)  8$. COPY NO.    SOWAR cabinet civil DEFENCE REPORT NO.   lh.Fourteenth Report submitted &quot;by the Ministerof Home Security, covering the period from midnight, .18th February, to Midnight, 3rdMarch, &quot;M9U0.(Previous Report:    Paper No. W.P. (R)  (ho) 70-).Enemy Air Attack.1.     No bombing raids have taken place during the period buthostile aircraft have been active off the North-East and east coast, particularly on the 22nd February and the 2nd March.On the former date a Heinkel bomber was brought down atLumsdaine, Berwickshire.Air Raid Shelters.2.      A review of the progress of shelter provision of all kindsthroughout the country shows that, although in many areassubstantial progress has been made by local authorities,  therel!is still leeway to be made up in the programme of domesticshelter.      In addition to the steel shelter, designs of various^alternative forms of domestic shelter have, in the past, beenbrought to the attention of local authorities.      A circularis now being issued containing details of a new type, to be constructed in brick and concrete, particularly appropriate for blocks of houses where, owing to limitations of space andthe nature of the ground, neither the steel shelter nor theindividual brick shelter can conveniently be erected.      this new type of domestic shelter is designed to hold h8 persons,though it can be adapted for use by smaller numbers.      It is

simple in construction and inexpensive.30      Local authorities in vulnerable areas have &quot;been informedthat they should aim at the provision of shelter, includingboth domestic and public shelter, for approximately 80 per cent of their population.4.      The provision of shelter under the Civil Defence Act in factories is proceeding very satisfactorily.      Progress is rather slower in the case of commercial establishments, butin the most important cities substantial work has been done.Sport.5.      A reduced programme of race meetings has been agreed withthe Jockey Club and the National Hunt Committee.      this programme will in general allow fairly widespread racingoutside the populous areas.      The Epsom and Ascot meetingsare among those abandoned.Casualty Services.6.      On 3rd March, the number of vacant beds in England andWales was approximately 125,000, showing no change on. thefigure for a fortnight ago.      The number of Service patientsoccupying casualty beds has again fallen, owing in part tothe abatement of the influenza epidemic.7.      In Scotland, returns received on 3rd March showedapproximately 12,770 beds as available for the reception of casulties.      This shows an increase of 1,470 over the fortnight,due to the inclusion in the returns of some 1,500 beds held instore by local authorities, which could be erected and equippedat a moment&apos;s notice.8.      The adequacy of the existing hospital accommodation tomeet the requirements of the civilian population and Serviceneeds has been the subject of discussion between the Health

Departments and the War Office.      It is estimated that,when the present hutting schemes are completed, little over200,000 &quot;beds could, in an emergency, be made available at short notice for casualties and Service sick.      This figurefalls short rjf the figure of 300,000 which it was at one timeproposed should be made available for civilian casualties;in addition the War Office estimate their maximum hospitalrequirements in this country at any one time during thepresent year at 70,000 beds.      While it is now felt that,having regard to the course uf the war, the existingaccommodation might be sufficient for civilian casualties,it is considered that the War Office needs could not besatisfied, consistently with covering the requirements of.the civilian population, except by further building,9.      It has accordingly been decided, with the approval ofthe Treasury, to construct additional huts to accommodatea further 45,000 beds, at an estimated cost of  9,000,000.The construction will be-arranged by -the Health Departments,who have been responsible for the previous schemes.       Thework will proceed by stages, as suitable sites are found, andwill be kept under constant review in the light of the war situation.Evacuation.10.     In pursuance of the policy referred to in the last Report&quot;1&quot;3,703,000 leaflets have been sent to Local Authorities in the reception areas for distribution   to householders, invitingthem to enrol as willing to assist in the work of receivingand caring for evacuated children, both those who may bebrought to the district in the event of air raids and thosewho are already there.-* Civil Defence Report No.  13. para.  13.

11.      The Railway Companies have prepared time-tables for evacuation on the basis of information supplied to them bythe Health Departments.      Conferences are being held in the reception areas to deal with the local application of thesetime-tables and the necessary road transport arrangements atthe detraining stations.12.     The percentage of school children who have returnedto the London area is now 40 per cent, as compared with 35per cent on 21st January,      The rate of return appears to haveslackened somewhat but it cannot be said that the movementhas C-osaedj and in many receiving areas there is greatdifficulty in securing additional billets where required.Publio Order.13.     Widespread activity on the part of the Communist party and the Peace Pledge Union is reported, but as a rule it hasnet been on a large scale, and Chief Officers of Policegenerally are agreed that the public response has beenindifferent or hostile.      The British Union of Fascists seemsto have been less active.Railways.14.      With the improvement in the weather there has been asubstantial increase in the clearance of laden coal wagonsfrom the collieries.Docks and Harbours.15.      The ports are now working normally, but local shortages of railway wagons and wagon sheets continue to delay the free movement of goods from the ports.Road Transport.16. The position as regards both goods and passenger transport is no longer affected by weather conditions and is satisfactory.

Storage,170      A survey -f available accommodation for storagepurposes in selected districts has been carried out by theOffice of Works, and apprcximately 25 million square feet of accommodation in vacant factories, warehouses, etc., in some200 towns have been scheduled and the information placed atthe disposal ;f the Ministries of Supply and Pood and theMinistry of Transport.Alternative Aceommodation for Government Staffs.ISo     Five hundred Civil Servants were moved from Londonduring the peri :d under review, bringing the number ofevacuated headquarters staffs up to about 21000.Jo AoMinistry of Home Security,Hjme Office^Whitehall.8th March,  1940.
