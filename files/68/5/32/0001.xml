5.    The first meeting with the Latvian Trade Delegation washeld on the 27th February,    It resulted from the discussion thatLatvia was not in a position at present to send any produce to theUnited Kingdom, with the exception of flax, small quantities ofwhich are being forwarded via Odessa.      It was further decided to -ration the goods passing through the Contraband Control.Discussions are proceeding.BELGIUM.6.    The exchanges of notes embodying the special agreementtook place in London and Paris on March 1st.    The only outstandingQuestion is that of lubricating oils, about which discussions withthe French Government are proceeding.THE NETHERLANDS.7.    Owing to the pressure caused by the Swiss and Swedishnegotiations in Paris the French authorities have not yet been ableto consider the British reply to the French comments on the draft agreement.    Negotiations are therefore suspended, but theNetherlands Delegation has remained in London.SWITZERLAND.8.     The War Trade negotiations have been resumed in Paris,but no report has yet been received on their progress.ITALY9.      Ships leaving port with German coal for Italy becamesubject to enemy export control r.i from midnight on March 1st,    Aconsiderable number of ships are loading German coal at Rotterdamand Antwerp, and the Italian Coal Monopoly has asked for a furtherrespite for them on the ground that they would have sailed beforethe expiry of the time limit but for the fact that abnormal weather conditions had hindered or prevented loading,   This request isunder consideration.10.   An extremely strong pxvotest from the Italian Governmenton the subject of the stoppage of German sea-borne coal and on our contraband and enemy export control in general, has been reoeived,and is under consideration.

11.    Commercial negotiations between the French and italian governments are proceeding in Paris.hungary.12.   A Hungarian delegation headed by Dr. Quandt arrived in London on February 26th to negotiate the import quotas to beestablished under the rationing agreement.    A meeting to discussvarious general questions was held on March 1st, but consideration of the quotas has had to be deferred pending clarification of theFrench Government&apos;s attitude towards the basis to be adopted for the quota figures.ISPAIN.13.     The negotiations for a General Trade Agreement seemat last to be reaching their final stages.    It has probably becomeI clear to each side that the other is dissembling a certain anxietyI to sign, but it is hoped that the game will run its course by theSend of this week.lh.     The Spanish Government has asked the Indian Trade   ,1 Commissioner for Europe, who has been in Madrid, to sell 100,000I tons of pea-nuts (value about  1 million) for cash, either in1 sterling or dollars, and has shown great anxiety to conclude thisI purchase before the signature of the Trade Agreement.    The TradeI Commissioner refused and referred the matter to the British Embassy.I The ostensible reason for the Spaniards&apos;  desire to purchase is thatI ?ea-nut oil can be used domestically, releasing a correspondingI amount of olive oil, of much higher value, for export.    The mannerIof the proposal, and the Spaniards&apos;   anger at its rejection have,I however, given rise to a suspicion that the ultimate intendedj destination of the pea-nut oil may be Germany.    There is nothingI yet to confirm this suspicion, and if we can be satisfied that itI is unfounded, we shall be prepared to consider the deal after the1isignature, of the Agreement.15.    We have told the Spaniards also that once theAgreement is signed, we shall be prepared to discuss selling them Australian wheat on very favourable terms.   As a quid pro quo we Shall/

We shall ask them either- to bring some Australian wheat for us intheir ships or to make their shipping available for the Spain-U.K.traffic in ores.ROUMANIA AND BULGARIA.16.    Treasury Authority has been given to purchase up to200,000 tons of maize in Roumania and/or Bulgaria for shipment inAoril, May, and the first half of June,  at prices not exceeding 70%above the oai.f. price of Argentine Maize.    The Treasury have further agreed that as much Bulgarian maize as can be  bought at a price notexceeding 15% above the comparable Argentine price c.i.f. may beregarded as additional to the 200,000 tons.EGYPT.17.   Pressure is again being applied in Egypt to induceH.M.G. to buy cotton.     But it appears that stress is no longerbeing laid on arguments based on Egypt&apos;s alleged right to compensation on account of the greater strictness of Great Britain&apos;control of Egyptian cotton exports to dangerous destinations ascompared with the contraband control of American cotton exports.The pressure to buy is now based on general political grounds.IRAN18.    Economic relations between Iran and Germany appear to .have deteriorated owing to the non-delivery of German goods.Consideration has been given to a proposal that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should buy 6,000 to 6,000 tons of Iranian cotton, whichwould probably otherwise go to Germany.    It seems likely that itmight be arranged for the trade to buy this cotton, if samples can beproduced, and H.M. Minister at Tehran has been asked to try toarrange this.AFGHANISTAN19.      The Afghan Government have so far refused our offerat the ruling world price for 10,000 to 18,000 tons of cotton, on&quot;the plea of a higher offer from elsewhere.CHINA20,-     Further representations have been received from

Economic relations between Iran and Germany appear tohave deteriorated owing to the non-delivery of German goods.Consideration has been given to a proposal that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should buy 6,000 to 8,000 tons of Iranian cotton, whichwould probably otherwise go to Germany,    It seems likely that itmight be arranged fov the trade to buy this cotton, if samples can beproduced, and H.M.

Further representations have been received from

the Chinese Government regarding the continued detention at&quot;HongKong of the Soviet vessel &quot;&quot;olsnga&quot;&apos;,   Meanwhile the FrenchGovernment have expressed the strong view that the cargo on thisvessel, or at least the wolfram on hoard, should not he allowed toproceed to Russia,    The French authorities think that there is acase for seizing this material;  and they have suggested thatarrangements should he made to have the case transferred, to thecontrol of the French authorities0Contraband and Enemy Export Agreements with Firms.21,    In the past week a general guarantee of non-enemydestination covering future imports was received from the VacuumOil Company A/B Fin&quot;. i..d.    An Agreement was made with the NorwegianZinc Company A/S whereby the Company gave a blanket undertaking ofnon-enemy destination and promised to supply monthly statements ofimports and exports,    A. satisfactory agreement was concluded withthe Royal Hungarian Steam Navigation Company, Budapest, whosevessels run between Budapest and Alexandria, and which has promised to hold back goods when required to do so, at ports of dischargeeven on the Danube,  and to supply cargo information to H.M.Representatives at various ports in time to allow the Ministry toexercise this right,.^PNTRABM:!D CORtROL^22.    During the week ending 2nd March, 105 new cases ofships were dealt with and 56 previous cases, in regard to whosecargoes or items thereof enquiries had been completed, were disposed of,23-    I11 73 cases entire ^cargoes were released, either on first consideration or after enquiries,2ho    The system under which advance copies of manifestsof cargoes are received and considered before the ships arrival at ports in this country resulted,  during the week under review,  in72 cases being so dealt with and in A 5 cases the ships concernedbeing released hy the Committee subject merely to  the formal checkingof/

of the original manifests on their arrival at the Control Bases.5 ships were giving &quot;missing Kirkwall&quot; clearances. In addition tothese immediate releases, in 8 other cases,  the Committee1s decisionto release was given within 5 days or less of the arrival of ships at the Control Bases,    Of ships released 28 sailed under Hold-BackGuarantees.NA.VI CERTS.25.    Since the introduction of the Navicert system27,913 applications for navicerts have been received up to the 2ndMarch.    Of these 22,113 have been granted and 1220 refused, whilek,580 are pending or have not yet been presented for consideration.ENEMY EXPORTS CONTROL.26.     The Committee met 6 times this week.    It reviewedIk ships,  one of which was referred to it toe late for action,releasing 7, detaining 1, reminding the agents of 1 of theobligations under the hold-back guarantee, releasing the mastersof 2 from this undertaking and ordering items of cargo from 3 to beplaced in Prize,27.    The Committee considered 30 specific applications for exemption, granting 9, refusing 18 and deferring considerationof 3.    In addition, 135 were treated summarily, 19 being granted and 116 refused.280    Among the general questions discussed by theCommittee were (!) Certificates of Origin for the experts of certainconsignors in Italy,  (2) the supply of tyres from the U.K. and elsewhere for German-made cars, (3) the enforcement of hold-backguarantees in U.S, pores.(l)    Certificates of Origin were being refused tocertain Italian exporters by reason of the enemy interest in the share-hoiding;  and the Ministry was approached with a view tosome settlement being reached,   The Pore&quot;5 30 Office and theFrench Mission agreed in recommending that an arrangement should, if possible, be made with the companies concerned and/

and that it should not become a political issue with theItalian Government; and the Committee approved thesuggestion of the Exemptions Committee that, pendingnegotiations, export-passes should be issued to one ofthe companies, leaving the question of Certificates of origin unprejudiced,On this point there is considerable difference ofopinion, since it is bjr no means clear that the negotiationsnow proceeding with neutrals designed to curtail this formof German trade are likely to reach any satisfactoryconclusion5     On the other hand the difficulties inthe way of negotiating with neutrals will be greatlyincreased if in the meantime British exporters are allowedto ship tyres for the completion of German cars.H.M. Embassy in Washington and H-.M. Consulate-general in New York have reported that any action taken by H.M.G.to enforce hold-back undertakings in the U.S.A. and toprevent the delivery of goods to consignees there might lead to an unpleasant rebuff from the U.S. authorities.
