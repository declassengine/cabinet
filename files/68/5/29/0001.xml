(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 SGOVERNMENT)secret.P.(r)(40) 79Copy no war cabinetb u r mTWELFTH FORTNIGHTLY REPORT submitted by the Secretary ofState Tor Burma covering the period 16th-29th February ly40.Both Houses of the Legislature have been in sessionduring the period under review.   In the House ofRepresentatives a Motion was tabled by the Opposition for february 23rd, the first part of which expressedabhorrence at aggression by Governments inside and outside europe (this apparently aimed at Japan against whom and infavour of China opinion in Burma has lately veered) and complete sympathy with oppressed nations; the Motion wenton to express regret that the British Government had madeBurma a participant in the war between Great Britain andGermany &quot;without the consent of the people of Burma&quot; andhad further, &quot;in complete disregard of Burmese opinion&quot;,passed laws and adopted measures curtailing the powers and activities of the Burma Government.    It asked theGovernment to convey to the British Government that &quot;inconsonance with the avowed aims of the present war it isessential, in order to secure the co-operation of the burmese people, that the - principles of democracy with adequate safeguards for the preservation of the rightsand interests of the minorities be immediately applied to burma, and her policy be guided by her people and that(previous Report: W.P.(R)(40) 63.GENERAL

Burma should be recognised as an Independent Nationentitled to frame her own Constitution; and further, thatsuitable action should be taken, in so far as it ispossible in the immediate present, to give effect to that principle in regard to the present governance of Burma&quot;.Despite the views which the Premier at first expressed tothe Governor, the Ministry were not willing to move an amendment substituting for all except the first part of the motion (which, eventually, was moved separately and adoptedunanimously) a sentence approving the action of theMinistry in its policy of full support for Burma1s war effort and expressing confidence in the Government in their efforts to obtain by constitutional means a fuller measureof self-government.   They feared that they would not succeed in carrying such an amendment.    In these circum-stances the Governor thought fit not to press the ministers and it was arranged that the motion should be talked out.In the debate, however, Dr. Ba Maw, the former premier andLeader of the Opposition (whom Ministers are consideringprosecuting in view of recent objectionable speeches)tabled an amendment to the second part of the motion in extreme terms.   At the conclusion of the debate in which ministers&apos; speeches stressed the need for advancing on constitutional lines, Dr. Ba Maw&apos;s amendment was rejected by 70 votes to 36; but owing to maladroitness the substantive motion was unfortunately put to the House and declared carried by a majority without a division.In the Senate U Kyaw Din, who had moved a motion ofloyalty and devotion to the King in September, moved on29th Pebruary a Resolution on similar lines to that carried in the House of. Representatives, but somewhat milder inits language.    The mover stressed that co-operation byBurma in the war must be unconditional and condemned the

demands made in some quarters for a Constituent assembly and immediate independence, but asked that, within thepresent Constitution, Burma should be associated in an increasing measure with administration in the higher posts.The Revenue Minister opposed the motion, though expressingsympathy with the principles underlying it, but it wascarried by 18 votes to 12.There is again nothing to report under the usualspecific heads.Z.Richmond Terrace, s.w. 1.4th March 1940.
