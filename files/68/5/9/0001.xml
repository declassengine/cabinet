Twenty-second weekly Report on the Oil Position.The only appreciable change in the stocks of petroleum forthe Services, as compared with last week&apos;s return,  is an increasein the reserves of motor spirit held by the War Office both inthis country and in   France.On the civil side stocks of motor spirit and of lubricating oils again showed some increase.      Stocks of other products andof crude oils decreased somewhat. The question of improving the stocks of fuel oil is being actively pursued with the Petroleum BoaThe number of tankers which arrived in this country duringthe week was twenty, of which four were engaged on admiralty service.      This was an increase of two on the previous week.Particulars in respect of the past three weeks, togetherwith the weekly average for the three pre-war months and for thepast five months are set out in Table II.    The prospects of anincrease in the number of Norwegian tankers entering allied serviceover the next two months have recently improved.The total quantity of all products imported during the week(Table III) was 226,000 tons, an improvement of 46,000 tons overthe previous week.The forward programme for the four weeks ended 9th March(Table V), shows a slight reduction and the expected arrivals,excluding imports on Admiralty account, are rather lower thanthe total imports in January.With the improvement in weather conditions there wereincreases in the deliveries of all products but conditions were still not sufficiently normal in some districts for the figures to give a reliable guide to the actual current rates of consumption (Table VI).The following tables are appended:Table II. Tanker arrivals.Table III. Tonnage of imports on weekly basis.Table IV. Tonnages imported during past five months.Table V. Forward programme of tanker arrivals.Table VI. Consumption from civil stocks.Table I.      Stocks (a) service civil.
