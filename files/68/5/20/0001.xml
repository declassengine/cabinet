(R)   (40) 70.WAR cabinet civil DEFENCE REPORT NO.   15.Thirteenth Report submitted, by the Ministerof Home Security, covering the period from midnight 4th February, to Midnight 18thFebruary, 1940T(Previous Report; Paper NOc W.P.(R)   (40)  (51)).Enemy Air Attack.1.     No bombing raids have taken place during the period buthostile aircraft were active off the Scottish, North East and east Coasts on the 9th February, when a Heinkel bomber was brought down near North Berwick.      The crash caused no civildamage.      Yellow warnings were given in Kent on the 13thFebruary and in the Eastern Counties on the 17th.Air Raid Precautions Services.2.      Following rumours about the possible use of a new war gasby the enemy, which apparently originated amongst soldiers on leave from France, a Parliamentary question and answer was arranged, and a circular has been sent to local authorities, onthe subject of arseniuretted hydrogen.      It has been made clearthat this gas is not considered dangerous from the point of viewof the civilian population.3.      The issue to local authorities of a training manual,entitled &quot;Basic Training in Air Raid Precautions&quot;, marks afurther stage in the development of regular training in theA.R.P. Services.      It is a consolidation of previous separatemanuals and it has been made clear to local authorities thatthis training should be given, not only to A.R.P. personnel,but to as many members of the public as possible.      The Manualwill later be put on sale, and in the meantime local authoritieshave been urged to invite members of the public to attendlectures on the subject.4.      With a view to reducing the heavy expenditure involvedin the continuous manning of air raid warning sirens, localauthorities have been asked to consider the installation of .systems of remote control, in any case where the adoption ofsuch a system, in.conjunction with periodical tests, wouldresult in economy.-Emergency Fire Brigade Service.5.      Good progress has been made in the supply of fire-fightina-equipment.      A total of 22,300 pumping units and about14,000,000 feet of fire hose have now been provided.Casualty Services. \6.      On February 18th, the number of vacant casualty beds inEngland and Wales was approximately 125,000, showing a slight jincrease on the figure for a fortnight ago, though still areduction of 5,000 on the figure of .a month ago.      The number

2oof Service sick occupying casualty beds has fallen, largely owing to a lessening of the influenza epidemico7.      In Scotland the number of casualty beds available v/as11,300, an increase of 600 on the figure for a fortnight ago.8.      In a previous report&quot;t&quot;it was stated that all the voluntary hospitals in London (including the teaching hospitals), inwhich the number of beds available for civilian sick had beenreduced under the Emergency Hospital scheme, were being askedto submit proposals for increasing the number of bedsavailablec      Proposals from nearly all the hospitals have nowbeen approved, as a result of which approximately 1,500additional beds.have been made available for civilian sickin the inner hospitals of London.     A considerable saving tothe Exchequer has been effected by reducing the number of bedsreserved for casualties,,9.      Some 300 prisoners rescued from the  &quot;Altmark&quot; were landed at Leith on Saturday, 17th February.      All were taken to hospital for care and medical inspection,     A few of the men whose homes were near at hand were discharged the same day and the majority left on Sunday the 18th.      Reports on their conditions are being obtained from the medical superintendentsof the two hospitals concerned.      The arrangements fordealing with the men were made under the general instuctions in regard to marine casualties issued by the Department ofHealth for Scotland to seaboard local authorities, andfunctioned smoothly and efficientlye10.    The Health Departments have agreed with the british medical Association and other interested organisations on ascheme for providing free domiciliary medical treatment, ifcontinued hospital treatment is impracticable, for air raidcasualties and for Civil Defence volunteers suffering from war service injuries who are not covered by the provisionsof the National Health Insurance Acts.      Doctors giving thetreatment are to be paid a capitation fee of 16/- a year foreach patient011.    Proposals for the reorganisation of the Emergency medical service in Scotland have been put forward by the ScottishCentral Medical War Committee.      Generally, the proposals are on the lines of the reorganised English scheme and are acceptable to the Department of Healths12.    The Scottish Central Emergency Committee for the NursingProfession is being replaced by a Scottish Civil NursingReserve Advisory Council, for which the nursing profession,employers of nurses and voluntary (nursing) bodies are beinginvited to nominate representatives.      This follows thesimilar action taken in England and Wales.xEvacuation.13.    On February 15th, the Minister of Health made a statement in the House of Commons outlining the Governments plans forfurther evacuation in the event of air raids.      A circular and See Civil Defence Report No012, para0904- Civil Defence Report NOclO, para09c

3omemorandum were issued to local authorities on the same dateoThe plans provide for the evacuation of school children accom-panied by teachers;    but evacuation will not take place untilthe Government considers that the development of air raidingmakes it necessary.      The Government will also determine atthe time the evacuating areas in respect of which plans are tobe put into operation,,14.    The rate of billeting allowance in respect of allchildren who have attained the age of 14 is to be increased to10/6d per week as from March 2nd0      The use of sick bays, andof hostels for difficult children and other purposes? is to be developed.    Billeting allowances are to be made more widelyavailable for private arrangementsa15.    Emphasis is placed in the circular on the importance ofan equitable distribution of the task of receiving children;at the present time only about I householder in 5 of those whovolunteered a year ago is being called on, and local authoritiesare asked to issue an appeal to householders to enrol as willingto share in the tasks,      Local authorities in the evacuatingareas have been informed of the number of children in respectof whom plans should be prepared under the new scheme, and havebeen requested to arrange for the registration of childrenwhose parents desire them to be evacuated;,      Local Authoritiesin the receiving areas have been informed of the quotaassigned to their district, and have been requested to see thattheir organisation is ready to function at short notice, ifnecessary.16.    A conference has been held with the transport authorities,who have been advised of the numbers of children involved andtheir distributions      the railway companies are working outtime tables in detail and aim at having them ready by thebeginning of March.Schools.17.    The Board of Education have issued a Circular to LocalEducation Authorities emphasising the need for the resumptionat the earliest possible date of full-time education for allchildren, including infants.      Authorities in evacuation areas have been informed that, as soon as sufficient accommodation is available, school attendance should again be enforced^18.    In order to facilitate the resumption of full-timeeducation, the Ministry of Home Security have asked localauthorities to release school buildings used for Civil defence purposes where their use is required for educational purposes.Arrangements are also being made for the dispersal of schoolchildren for whom shelter cannot be made available on theschool premises to- their own homes or to neighbouring houses inthe event of an air raid.Public Order.19.    public order and morale remain good.      The Peaceorganisations continue to engage in propaganda and a  &quot;Women;sSilent March&quot; is planned in Cardiffo      A&quot; similar march in coventry was abandoned on police advice.      The Communist partycontinues to urge the stoppage of the War and to attack theFinnish government it appears also to be attempting tocreate industrial unrest.      Fascist activity also continues andthere are isolated reports of anti-Jewish feelingo

J.A.Ministry of Home Security,Home Office,Whitehall,23rd February, 1940.Railways.20.    The coal supply situation is still difficult, and special arrangements have been made to transport 143 train loads perweek from the pits in the Northumberland, Durham and MidlandAreas direct to destinations in the London, Southern and SouthWestern consuming area so      This represents additional traffic to the extent of nearly 72,000 tons per week.Docks and Harbours.21.    The severe weather conditions have continued to hamperthe operation of the ports (particularly those on the north-east and north-west coasts) but no serious congestion occurred on the quays or in the transit sheds.      Local shortage ofrailway wagons, especially of the closed type, caused some delay in the free movement of goods from the ports and owingto insufficient supplies of sheets it was not possible to makethe fullest use of available open wagons.Road Transport.22.    Both goods and passenger road transport continued inmany areas to be affected by weather conditions in the earlier part of the period under review but conditions have now, withsome exceptions, returned to normal.Alternative Accommodation for Government Staffs.23. Contracts have been placed for temporary buildings forthe accommodation of approximately 10,000 evacuated staffs;schemes are in preparation for buildings for a further 20,000.
