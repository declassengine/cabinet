weekly Report on action taken for period $1st March -7tii AprilVisit of konsieur Georges Monnet, Ministre du Blocus.1. Monsieur Georges Monnet,  the new French Minister of blockade, visited nondon at the end of the Week, and meetingstook place between him and Mr. Gross on the 5th and 6th ^pril.The Meetings provided an opportunity for a review of a numberof important questions affecting the blockade.2. The chief subject discussed was that of the rationing of neutral countries.      It was recognised that the crux ofthis problem was the treatment of Italy.     Mr;,. Cross explainedthat the question of the policy to be adopted, towards italy was being urgently considered by his Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom.and. that until a decision had been taken on this point,  it was not desirable to start the forciblerationing of the smaller neutrals.      The following resolution on this subject was agreed:-&quot;The two Ministers agree that it has become necessary forthe purposes of economic warfare to ration imports ofadjacent neutrals and that in applying this policy no discrimination must be made between the smaller andthe more important neutral countx^ies.     The rationingwould be applied to selected commodities;    and it should if possible be arranged by agreement, particularly inthe case of the countries with which war Trade agreements have been concluded.      The system of havlcerts should beextended and if satisfactory progress cannot be made byagreement, navicerts would be refused for consignmentsin excess of the proposed, ration and if such consignmentsare shipped without navicerts, steps should be taken to detain them11.3. other/

3o other steps discussed included the supply of oil toGermany from b .S.Sand Roumania and stocks of oil in neutral countries, especially Italy and Holland:    the supplyof awedish iron ore to Germany and the adaptation of the^nglo-Swedish War Trade agreement to meet French requirementscontraband control in the ^astern and western Mediterranean:the control of civil air lines&apos;    contraband control in theEar i^ast:    and blockade purchases in the Balkans.z+o It was agreed, that every effort should be made toimprove contraband control arrangements in the Eastern and&quot;western i^mediterranean and also round the Atlantic coasts ofthe Iberian Peninsula.     .as regards the Eastern Mediterraneanthe measures considered were the conclusion of additionalagreements with shipping lines, the authorisation of alliedinspecting officers in neutral ports, and the establishmentof a contraband control base in the Aegean.     as regards thelatter point it was evident that it would be exceedingly difficult to obtain the Greek Government&apos;s consent and itwas pointed out that in any case the present was not asuitable time to press for the establishment of a base,since no base ship was available.5. It was agreed that the volume of contraband traffic between Spain and Italy gave cause for serious disquiet andthat the position demands that Spain and Portugal shouldhenceforth be treated as adjacent neutrals.      The alliedVvar Trade Reporting arrangements in Spain and Portugal shouldbe improved,  the navicert system should be extended to bothSpain and Portugal as consignor countries and the issue of certificates of Origin in Portugal should be resumed.    PinallM. ivionnet agreed that every effort should be made to tightenup the Naval control in the &quot;Western Mediterranean and round the Western coasts of Spain and Portugal.      it was, however,recognised that owing to the shortness of the passage betweenthe Balearics and Italy and the distance of the Atlantic portfrom/

from any convenient control &quot;base, tlie tightening up ofthe patrols involves great difficulties,6. The two Ministers agreed that the development ofair traffic, especially between opain and Italy andGermany, threatens to produce a serious leak in theblockade and that it is of great importance to establishrapidly the principle that civil air lines should.be asmuch subject to contraband control as merchant shipping.They agreed that xoossible means of controlling civil airlines should be urgently considered by their two Ministriesbut that it would be a mistake to maice any announcement ofthe intention to control civil air lines until it had beendecided exactly what measure of control would be possiblein practice.7. The proposals for   establishing satisfactory contra-band control in-the Pacific were reviewed with special reference to the possibility of arriving at agreements with Japan and with the U.b.a.      It was recognised thatthe attitude of the U.b..a. largely governed the question,and that where the wishes of the U.s.a, Government and theclaims of the Japanese Government could not be reconciled,the former would have to take precedence.      It was agreedthat the Prench Government should take action similar tothat taken by His&apos;Majesty1s Government in the United kingdom to deny Japan supplies of raw materials, in particular iron,tin and rubber etc., from Indo-China.8. The two Ministers recognised the special importanceof denying to Germany supplies of animal fats, fodder andoilseeds.      It was agreed that immediate consideration shouldbe given to the problem of transport from Balkan countries.as regards payment for pre-emptive purchases, it was recog-nised that the prior agreement of both Governments shouldnot be required before the completion of each purchase inorder/

order that it should rank as a blockade purchase, the loss on which fully to be shared between the two Governments, andthat it v/ould be sufficient for one country to notify theother of the &quot;proposed purchase, provided the latter fallswithin the sphere of economic warfare.      It was agreed thatthis view should be represented by both ministers to theirrespective Treasuries.;i.    x^ar^fraue. l,e got tattoo 3 ..ayp. gelations with peutral states .&quot;(fixe events of the present week in Scandinavia make much ofthis section out-of-date)KORwhf9* Lord Glenccnner returned from Oslo on April 7th afterthe first meeting of the standing Commission.

The first private Agreement to he concluded inconnexion with enemy export control was reached on nthApril;    in consideration of his Britannic Majesty&apos;s Consulsin Holland issuing Certificates of origin covering their various chemical products, N.V. Pabriek van ChemischeProducten, Vandelingenplaat, Holland, undertake to allowaccountancy and technical control hy our designates inorder to ensure that their products include no more than25/o by value of materials of enemy origin, and in additionundertake (a) to&apos; import from other neutral countries onlygoods covered by Certificates of origin, and (b) to limitexports to Germany to the value equivalent of the rawmaterials imported therefrom.29.       A blanket undertaking of Ultimate Destination hasbeen received covering the imports of the Lithuanian subsid-plenipoteniary of Socony Vacuum oil Co.30.       Negotiations are at present taking place with certain of the United States grain shippers and meat packers, with two British companies who together control the sale of Boraxfrom the U.c5,a. and with various other concerns.ENEMY iuAPURTb31.       The Committee met six times this week.     It reviewed17 ships ordering items of cargo on one to be discharged and placed in Px&apos;ize.      In the case of 6 others a decision wasdefexu&apos;ed for search or enquiry.      The remainder were released.32.       Special interest attaches to the s.s. ^Soemba1&apos; whichwas reviewed by the Committee on the 20th March when it was directed that five items of cargo should be discharged and placed in Prize.      a letter on 1st April from the Netherlandslegation contained the phrase &quot;She also proposes to load, ifyou will give the necessary facilities, 1,131 cases cartridgesfor anti-aircraft gunds of German manufacture1&apos;.     This was thefirst/

first occasion on which the Netherlands Legation had admittedthe desirability of collaborating with the Ministry to securefacilities;    and the Committee felt that its policy of detainingitems of cargo for which the Dutch authorities had not troubledto secure exemption was beginning to bear fruit.33.       The Committee considered 69 specific applications for exemption,  granting 5, refusing 4 and deferring considerationof 60,  in addition to those treated summarily, of which 31were granted and. 3ul refused.      The advice of the Committee wasalso sought in respect of general and specific applications forcertificates of origin^34-a       Among the general questions discussed by the Committeewere (1; certificates of origin for goods of non-enemy originpassing through Germany before shipment;    [2) the percentageof enemy material or labour allowable without disqualifyinggoods for certificates of origin and the desirability of reducing this percentage;    (3) certificates of origin for the personal effects of foreign diplomats;    and (4) the treatmentof goods of enemy origin or ownership transmitted by parcelsor letter mail.Arrangements for cargo inspection in Scandinavian ports.35.       It has been reported, by representatives of the Ministryof Economic warfare who are just finishing a voyage insvandinavia that agreement has been reached with the Swedishshipowners, whereby, in return for their vessels being allowedas a rule to omit calling at Kiricwall for contraband control -(1) the arrival at Swedish ports of all vessels of over1,000 tons will be reported to us;(2) the cargo of vessels may be verified at the Swedishport of unloading by British subjects approved &quot;&amp;y us;    and(3) our right to order ships,  if need be,  to British portsis conceded.36.       Eor some time attention has been given to the questionof devising/

of devising arrangements for the carrying on of contrahandand enemy export control, should the Ministry of economic warfare or its communications with Contraband Control bases and ports be severely damaged, by enemy action,,     a scheme has now been approved covering control in Northern Europeanwaters and a similar scheme for the mediterranean area will shortly be considered.      The basic principles of the emergencysystem are:(1) devolution of authority to decide on the seizure,detention or release of cargoes on CO.8. Officers and CustomsCollectors.(2) the laying down for tne guidance of these officers, ofclear interim instructions which taice account of Black Listconsiderations, War Trade Agreements, Navicert &quot;system, and thenecessity of withholding key commodities from Germany.      the automatic result of the destruction of the Ministry of economic warfare would, it is anticipated, be a tightening up and not a relaxation of control.37.       During his visit to Washington, Mr. Ashton Gwatkin hasdiscussed with the State Department various questions affectingContraband Control.      It has been uecided to make certain concessions which it is hoped will ensure the continuance ofthe- present attitude of goodwill shown by the U.8. government towards bu-r. Contraband Control.     Navicerts from the U.S.A.will in future not be refused, on evidence based essentiallyon conditions relating to American exporters.      In the caseof any temporary interruption in the issue of navicerts fora particular commodity to one or more neutral countries,the reasons will be explainea to U.S. shippers.    Further,when individual applications for navicerts are rejected

the British jiaribaaay in v,ashington will give to theapplicant a statement of the reason for the rejection.jo. Arrangements are heing made for examiningfor enemy exports, goods sent &apos;oj parcel poot on ships suhmitted to our controls.      fills is a consequenceof tue decision to examine outward mails, which was originally coxen hy the Vvar Cabinet at the ena ofNovember 1939? but which for laox of censorshipstaff and Other reasons/was not possible to put intoeffect until the beginning of April.    It is hoped thatthe examination of outward mails will considerablyincx^ease the amount of available infoxunation aboutevasions    of contraband and enemy export control.39.       Applications for exemption from enemy export control fox&apos; cargoes bounu. for spam from mediterraneancountries ax-e in future tv. be dealt with exclusivelyby the French authorities.
