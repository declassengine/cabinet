Lybe taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.Copy No.SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION.Report submitted by the First Lord of the Admiralty, covering thethree-monthly period december 1. 1939. to february 29. 1940.I.Naval Shipbuilding, Ship Repair and Conversion.THE amount of Naval New Coi*struction* in hand has increased during these three months from 433 vessels of total standard displacement 905,100 tons to 696 vessels of total standard displacement 969,600 tons. During this period56 vessels have been laid down, 31 have been launched and 16 have completed(including the last two of the &quot; K &quot; Class Destroyers forming the 5th destroyer flotilla, 3 of the ex-Brazilian Destroyers and the first of the Admiralty-designedTrawlers).   Details are given in the following table :  Laid Down.2 &quot; Dido &quot; Cruisers. 210 Destroyers. 17 Submarines. 19 Escort Vessels. 13 B.D.V&apos;s. 1113 Patrol Vessels. 34 Minesweepers. 27 Trawlers. 11 Minelaying Lighter. 9Launched.Battleships. 5Destroyer. 2Submarine. 1Destroyer Depot Ship.    1Escort Vessels. 3B.D.V&apos;s. 1Patrol Vessels. 2Minesweeper. 1Trawlers.Completed.Destroyers.Submarines.Escort Vessel.B.D.V.Trawlers.M.A./S.B.M.T.B&apos;s.Minelaying Lighter.The acceleration of the completion dates of the three battleships of the 1937Programme (Duke of York, Anson and Howe) has been under consideration and,by shortening of trials, it has been possible to advance the first by two months andthe Howe by four months. The earlier completion date of Howe is dependent onthe delivery of turrets in time.Owing to the acceleration of King George V the completion date of theAircraft-Carrier Victorious, building at the same yard, has gone back from october to December 1940.Labour difficulties in connection with the gun mountings have affected thecompletion dates of the Cruisers Naiad, Phoebe, Dido, Euryalus and Hermione,which will be later than those it had been hoped to achieve by periods ranging-from a fortnight to two months. Similarly, the Minelayer Latona will now be two months later in consequence of a difficulty in obtaining welders, and some 40of the Patrol Boats will be from one to three months late owing to the recentsevere weather, sickness and other causes.It has now been decided that the &quot; L &quot; Class Destroyers referred to inNovember, and the first 24 of the Fast Escort Vessels now under construction, are* Excluding ships building for other Governments and miscellaneous small vessels and theten patrol vessels which are to be built in Canada.
to complete with two gun mountings only, instead of three. The whole pro-gramme of completion of Destroyers and Fast Escort Vessels has been re-examined,and it is now anticipated that it-will be possible to achieve accelerated completionin a good many cases, though six of the earlier Escort Vessels may be delayed byperiods of about a month, consequent on necessary alterations.It is hoped to bring forward, by periods varying from two to five months,the completion dates of&quot; three &quot; T &quot;&apos; Class Submarines. The firm concerned is making every effort to accelerate these vessels in order to be able to proceedwith the &quot; S &quot; Class Submarines.It has been decided to build the following further vessels:  6 Boom Defence Vessels of the &apos;&apos; Bar &apos;&apos; class, of which it is hopedtwo will be built in Hong Kong.50 Wooden Minesweepers.40 M.A./S.B&apos;s. specially designed for patrolling the mouths of harbours.5 Modified &quot; S &quot; Class Submarines.4 Salvage Lifting Craft for dealing with wrecks in the entrances toports.1 Cable Ship.120 Motor Launches (&quot;Fairmile&quot; Type) for employment as A/S craft(to follow on at the rate of 20 a month for six months whenthe 25 M.A./S.B&apos;s. at present building by the Eairmile company are completed in May).Orders had been placed by the end of February for all these vessels, exceptfor the six B.D.V&apos;s., six of the AVooden Minesweepers and one of the harbourpatrol M.A./S.B&apos;s. Orders had also been placed for the seventy vessels referredto in the last Report.In view of the possible extension of the use of counter-magnetic-mine ships of the &quot; Borde &quot; type, and of the difficulty of finding suitable vessels for requisi-tion for this purpose, the possibility of building them has been under investiga-tion. It has been decided to construct 24 tubular-steel lighters for this purpose,and six of these have already been ordered.In advance of a decision on the 1940 New Construction Programme as awhole, orders have been placed for ten M.T.B&apos;s., together with engines for afurther 42 such boats.Pressure of work in ELM. Dockyards is very heavy, particularly in viewof the considerable number of vessels of high priority that are being dealt with,for example, in connection with the countering of magnetic mines, and theshortage of skilled labour is being acutely felt. In consequence the resourcesof private dockyards continue to be increasingly utilised to supplement H.M. Dock-yards, and there are at present 51 vessels (excluding Trawlers and other small craft) in hand by outside firms for repair.Auxiliary War Vessels and Mercantile Fleet Auxiliaries.The number of ships under requisition or charter at the end of february was 2,145, an increase of 622 since the end of November. The increase hasbeen due, in the main to the taking up of extra vessels for Minesweeping,Harbour Defence and Patrol, Enemy Aircraft Observation, Boom Working,Balloon Barrage service and Contraband Control. On the other hand, it hasnow been possible to release to their owners nearly 100 Trawlers, taken up during november and December to look out for parachute mines pending the completionof fully fitted M/S. Trawlers. It has also been decided that for the present no more ships are to be requisitioned for conversion to A.M.C.&apos; The rate of requisitioning has slowed down considerably during the past two months and, in fact, two-thirds of the increase referred to above took placein December. This is to a large extent due to the difficulty in obtaining suitablevessels. The total gross tonnage represented by the vessels taken up to date is close on 2,000,000 tons, and complaints have been receiA^ed from shipownerson account of the heavy drain on the Merchant Service and Fishing Fleetscaused by the requisitioning of shipping on this scale, particularly in view ofthe fact that, especially in the case of Trawlers, it is the best boats that arerequisitioned, as it is essential to take thoroughly reliable vessels for war service.The boats that are left, therefore, tend to be the older and less remunerative
and the most up-to-date concerns are inevitably the hardest hit. The Admiraltyis giving the most sympathetic consideration&apos;to this matter and as and whenpracticable such relief as is possible is given by the release of vessels from naval service. It is not apparent, however, how any immediate large-scale alleviationof the position can be achieved.The considerable progress made in fitting out such of the requisitioned shipsas need conversion is illustrated by the following main points : (1) A.M.C.&apos;s. The original fitting of all these has now been completed, i.e.,12 with emergency equipment and 37 semi-complete. Three of this number have now been taken in hand for conversion to completeequipment and the first is expected to be ready by the end of April.(2) Minesweepers. 292 ships have now been completed for this service while136 are still in hand. Included in these figures are 21 trawlers and93 drifters which have been completed for the operation of eithermagnetic or electric sweeps or skids, and 72 trawlers and 5 drifterswhich are in hand for this purpose.(3) Anti-Submarine Vessels. Eleven yachts (fully converted), 70 trawlers and 3 drifters have been completed. Eleven yachts, 6 trawlers and drifters are in hand.(4) Harbour Defence. 98 vessels have been fitted out, 11 being still in hand.(5) Enemy Aircraft Observation. Fourteen vessels are complete, 24 being in hand.In order to counter enemy aircraft attacks, it has been approved to fit bullet-proof protection to all Fleet Auxiliary Trawlers, Drifters and other small vessels.Arrangements are being made for the supply of the necessary bullet-proof plating,but in urgent cases, and until bullet-proof plating is available, mild steel plating-is to be fitted.It has also been decided to provide all small auxiliaries, merchant ships and fishing vessels operating in the North Sea with kite protection againstlow flying aircraft. It is estimated that in the first instance a total of about1,000 ships will be so fitted.Purchase of Vessels.The purchase of 65 Trawlers for Boom working has been sanctioned, providedthat such purchase would be more economical than hiring, and, of these, up tothe end of February, 10 large and 25 small vessels had been taken up and allocated for conversion. Two vessels for the Contraband Control at Aden are also to be bought in this country and it is proposed to acquire similarly a yacht for service as Armed Boarding Vessel in the Mediterranean.Acquisition of Vessels from Abroad.In order to meet the shortage in the United Kingdom of small vessels suitablefor requisition, further steps are being taken to procure them from abroad.Two Tugs and a Water Boat have been bought in Holland and the purchase in neutral countries of small vessels to a total of  360,000 has been sanctioned.Arrangements had been made by the end of February for the purchase of18 vessels accounting for about  187,000 of this sum.In view, however, of the increasing difficulty in finding suitable ships from neutral sources, investigations have been proceeding into the possibilities ofbuilding small vessels abroad, and arrangements are being made to build fiveRescue Tugs in Belgium. It was also intended to order Trawlers in that country,but this has been precluded by the amount of French and German constructionbeing undertaken there. The possibility of building a few more Trawlers in portugal is at present being investigated.Docking Position.The New Floating Dock for &quot; Tribal &quot; Class Destroyers, under constructionby Messrs. Swan Hunter is due to complete in May 1940, and arrangements forits towage from the Tyne to Scapa are under consideration.Southampton Floating Dock was transferred to its berth at Portsmouth onthe 24th February.
Rescue and Salvage Work.(a) Rescue Tug Service. By the end of February there were 13 Rescue Tugsin service, of which seven were armed, and it is expected that five more willbecome available for this service during March, thus bringing the total number to 18 as against an estimated requirement of 30.Co-operation with the French Naval Rescue Tug Service has resulted in the stationing of Tugs at selected points on the English and French Coasts.During the three months under review 71 calls for assistance were answered,40 with successful results, while in 11 cases the help sent was not required. -(b) Salvage Service. Four of the five Salvage Vessels (including the twoacquired abroad) which have been under refit, are now ready for service, as isalso the Dumb Salvage Lighter purchased in Holland. The remaining Salvagevessel is expected to complete during March.In view of the special vulnerability of the Tyne to air attack, and of the factthat it is likely to be several months before the four Salvage Lifting Craftreferred to earlier in this Report are ready for service, it has been decided tostrengthen six large hoppers belonging to the Tyne Improvement Commissioners,and to obtain, and store until required for use, certain necessary equipment, suchas beams, compressors and lifting wires.Deliveries of all items of Salvage Equipment are coming forward regularlywith the exception of 12-inch Motor Pumps and Portable Electric Generators.In each case delivery is expected to commence in March.During the past three months 25 Merchant Vessels have been salved. Salvagework has also been completed on certain service casualties, and work of the wreckof the Gipsy is continuing.II.Equipment and Warlike Stores.Gun Mountings, Director and Fire Control.The labour position is still the critical factor in the production of these items of equipment. It is materially unchanged since the last Report; and labour exchanges are finding increased difficulty in meeting the unsatisfied demands for skilled labour.So far enemy action has not directly affected factory production ofarmaments. Indirectly, however, additional commitments fall on the principalfirms on account of repair work necessitated by enemy action at sea, and this work must inevitably influence the completion dates of ships under construction.Provision of additional Armament Capacity.Steady progress is being made with the development of new capacitypreviously reported, with the exception that where new buildings are involved the recent severe weather has had a serious effect. New firms are added to thesuppliers of all classes of Armament Stores wherever possible without prejudice to the prior claims of other services.The proposal for the manufacture of Oerlikon guns in this country, referredto in the last Report, has now been sanctioned.Progress is being made with the scheme for the provision of additional capacity for anti-aircraft ammunition referred to in the last report, and anumber of proposals have already been approved under this scheme.Special steps have also been taken in conjunction with the Ministry ofSupply to increase capacity for filling mines, depth charges and torpedowarheads. The peak load, which will develop about July 1940, is expected to involve 10 million pounds of explosive per month.New Weapons.As a result of the intensification of enemy air attacks on Trawlers, &amp;c, anumber of devices for increasing the defensive measures available for such craftare being put into production.Trials are in progress with a multiple LLP. (Rocket Projector) firing wirefilled shell incorporating a small bomb.   In order to protect small ships from
low-flying aircraft, a pneumatic gun firing Mills bombs the Holman Projector has been developed. An initial order for 500 has been placed, and orders for afurther 1,500 are under consideration. A 2-pounder equipment to fire case shot,and also a 12-pounder gun for the same purpose, are under investigation.In the meantime, and while lethal rockets are being developed, various formsof Schermuly rockets are being supplied to small ships in the hope that they will act as a deterrent to machine-gun attacks from the air.Guns and A ammunition, &amp;c.Steady progress is being made in the production of armament material. the severe weather experienced in January and the early part of February, however,hampered production considerably, especially in Lancashire and Wales, owing tosnow, lack of fuel, failure of electricity supplies and the breakdown of transport.Difficulties are being experienced more frequently than hitherto in obtaining a sufficient flow of raw materials to maintain outputs at full capacity in variousfactories, and, although constant touch is maintained with the materials controlsconcerned, it appears likely that partial shortage will continue in a numberof cases.Consignments of Oerlikon 20-mm. ammunition are now being received from switzerland. The first deliveries of guns are now starting, and it is hoped toget 60 by the end of March.In order to meet the increasing requirements of guns for arming trawlers and other small ships, some Lewis Guns have been obtained from the War Officeand the Air Ministry, while 250 have been purchased from a commercial firm in belgium.The output of new type Torpedoes for the large number of Submarines on order will not cover full reserves by the time the vessels commission, and in orderto meet this deficiency an extension of Whitehead&apos;s Torpedo Works is underconsideration.The rate of delivery of Depth Charges required in the next few months isappreciably in excess of pre-war forecasts and special action is being taken toobtain adequate production capacity.In order to provide reserves of mines for the Far East, manufacture inAustralia has been arranged to commence in May 1940. Five hundred mines havebeen ordered, delivery to be completed by the end of the year. The total capacityfrom this source is about 3,000 mines per annum.Mining Cables.The amount of mining cable now ordered is just under 8 million yards, ofwhich 900,000 yards has been completed. Difficulty is being experienced inobtaining adequate supplies of certain raw materials, and the large amount ofcable required for demagnetisation and other anti-mine purposes has interferedto some extent with the production of mining cable. The position, however, isgradually improving as a result of action with the appropriate controllers andmakers. About l-g million yards remain to be ordered, and the progress of manu-facture by the various makers is being studied in order to ensure that further orders are placed to the best advantage.Anti-Submarine Equipment.Delays in production of Anti-Submarine material give rise to considerable anxiety, despite the fact that spare capacity has been found, 40 contractors havingbeen added to the 85 employed at the outbreak of the War. The loss to the Forcesof skilled men from these firms is one of the principal causes of delay, and aspecial request for the release of about 100 such men has been referred to theWar Office and Air Ministry, and a favourable reply to this is an urgent necessity.In the meantime sickness of employees and delays from sub-contractors areaccentuating the difficulties of producing the required output.Short of asking for priority certificates, all possible steps are being taken to accelerate matters, but firms all state that they can only increase the rate at theexpense of other Departments&apos; contracts.
Indicator Loops. Deliveries of cable are now satisfactory. Deliveries ofControl equipment are increasing, but have not yet reached the desired rate andsome delay in establishing Indicator Loop Stations is being experienced. Everyeffort is being made to speed up manufacture to meet the extra laying facilities which will be available by the middle of the summer.Boom Defence Materials.The defences which have been and are now being provided reach a total ofabout 46 miles and, in order to provide a reserve for the maintenance of thesedefences and for urgent unexpected commitments, it has been decided to commenceplacing orders immediately for boom defence material to the value of  1,500,000and for indicator net defence to the value of  160,000.In addition to these reserves, provision is being made urgently for the protec-tion of the Fleet at Scapa against aerial torpedo attack at a cost of about 500,000 for material.Further schemes requiring the provision of boom defences, involving an expenditure of an additional  1,000,000 for material, apart from maintenancestores, are under consideration.Deliveries of boom defence material have hitherto been insufficient to meetconsumption requirements, but the rate of production is now being increased,and it is hoped that within the next two months production will more nearlymeet consumption.Counter Magnetic Mine Devices.Measures to combat these mines continue to be developed intensively and considerable progress has been made with the provision of the necessary equipment.In addition to the measures described in tlhe last Report (involving the conversion of special ships and of Aeroplanes, and the development of specialmagnetic and electric sweeps) work is proceeding on the provision of an electricallyenergised loop in the Clyde.A special department has been set up to deal with the demagnetisation ofships, which is considered to be the main line of defence against these mines.Sufficient cable has been delivered to the various ports to demagnetise temporarilyall H.M. Ships in Home Waters and about 600 Merchant Ships. Further cablesufficient to cover the remaining H.M. Ships and another 4,300 Merchant Ships&quot;is being manufactured in the United Kingdom, Canada, India, Africa and U.S.A.The numbers of ships dealt with to date are 195 H.M. Ships and Auxiliaries,and 180 Merchant Ships. Included among the H.M. Ships are 6 Battleships,2 Aircraft Carriers. 10 Cruisers and 33 Destroyers. Preparations for permanentdemagnetisation are continuing.Fleet Air Arm Aircraft.The number of aircraft in First Line Squadrons on the 29th February, 1940,was 261 with an equal number of Immediate Reserve. Similar figures forTraining aircraft were 292 and 128 respectively. Aircraft not allocated but heldtowards expansion and wastage requirements totalled 305.Deliveries of Aircraft and losses during the past three months are as statedbelow :  Delivered. Lost. Time expired.Torpedo Spotter Reconnaissance       17 23       fighters     ............     43 (including 13 from Air      6Ministry)Amphibians   and   Light Recon-      21 (including 3 from Air     10       1naissance Ministry)Miscellaneous Training Types   ...     35 (including  1  requisi-       4     10 (including 4 returnedfcioned) to R.A.F.)Total.........    116 43     ^There was a temporary fall in deliveries of Torpedo Spotter reconnaissance aircraft during December and January owing to technical difficulties due to achange over from the Sword fish tvpe to the Albacore.   The latter are however
now coming forward in increasing numbers and deliveries are expected to continuesteadily.   In fact 11 of the 17 quoted above were delivered during February.It is expected that Fulmar Fighters should begin to come out in April 1940.Fleet Air Arm Stores.No improvement has yet been effected with regard to the undermentioneditems, shortages of which have continued for some months : (1) Air frame spares for Sword fish and Walrus Aircraft.(2) Engine spares for the Bristol range of engines and for the ArmstrongSiddeley Tiger VI.(3) Cameras.III.Merchant Shipbuilding and Repairs and D.E.M.S.(N.B. &quot; Tonnage,&quot; when mentioned in this section, refers to Gross Tonnage,which has no relation to Standard Displacement quoted in other sectionsof the report in relation to Naval Vessels.)Following the decision of H.M. Government taken with a view to securing the advantages of centralising the use of all resources available for ship building and ship repair, both in materials and in labour, and of introducinggreater elasticity into the allotments of capacity to naval and mercantilerequirements, the Admiralty assumed, from the 1st February, 1940, theresponsibility for ensuring the necessary production of mercantile shipping,as well as that of meeting the requirements of the Navy. The Ministry ofShipping will advise on the types of ships required after consultation withshipowners, and the Admiralty will meet these requirements as far as possible,taking into consideration what ships are already building, availability ofberths, &amp;c. The Admiralty will also be responsible for seeing that, as far aspossible, adequate repair facilities are available and that the)&apos;- are being usedto the best advantage.The policy approved by the War Cabinet is that a rate of output of newmerchant ship construction of 1,500,000 tons a year should be reached by the1st February, 1941, which is about double the present rate.There is no intention to suppress private enterprise and shipowners willbe encouraged to build on their own initiative, under licence from the Admiralty,provided that the ships they wish to build are suitable for war-time needs. Inorder to ensure this, the specifications of the ships have to be approved by theMerchant Shipbuilding and Repair Department of the Admiralty, and allpossible simplification and eliminations are being made to increase speed ofbuilding and reduce requirements of material and hibour.In addition to ships building under licence, the Admiralty is placing ordersdirect with shipbuilders for new ships. The policy adopted is that yards shall continue to build types of ship with which they are familiar and which willbe of value in wartime.The four principal types of ship which will be built are Tankers, CargoLiners, Cargo Tramps and Coasters. In the planned programme for deliveries to the 31st December, 1940, the percentages of these four types are 13, 29-3,53-7 and 4 respectively.It is the first essential to see that all the yards which are immediately available for merchant ship construction are used to their maximum capacity.It is estimated that some 20,000 more men could be absorbed into existingshipyards for merchant shipbuilding and -repair alone. Discussions are now taking place between the Minister of Labour, the Shipbuilding Employers&apos;Federation and the Trades Unions on the question of increasing labour resources.Arrangements have been made for allocation of steel &apos; to meet the fullAdmiralty requirements for merchant ships, and special arrangements have beenmade for the import of 110,000 tons of steel from the U.S.A.; 60,000 tonsimmediately and the rest beginning in June. It is expected that this, togetherwith British production, should ensure an adequate supply.There are three yards which might be reopened without undue difficulty werelabour available, but it would be premature to take any action until the
discussions referred to above have been completed. It would be a very big task to reopen any totally dismantled yards, even if the necessary plant and machine toolscould be found, which is very doubtful. It is also necessary to guard against thedanger of dispersal of labour and of effort which the opening up of many newyards would cause.On the 24th February, 1940, 102 vessels totalling about 550,000 gross tons were building to Admiralty (or previous Ministry of Shipping) order and 197vessels totalling about 800.000 gross tons were in course of construction under licence.D.E.M.S.The number of Merchant Ships defensively armed up to the end of february was 1,944,* an increase of about 160 during the month. Of these, 380 had beenfitted with paravanes. Demagnetisation of merchant ships is proceedingintensively and 180 have so far been protected in this manner.The fitting of Kite protection on merchant ships using the North Sea hasbeen referred to in Section I of this Report.IV.Materials.There arc indications that the supply of steel and of certain non-ferrous metals may cause serious anxiety in the near future. This is particularly thecase with regard to brass, and it is understood that the Ministry of Supply intend to augment the Non-Ferrous Control forthwith by the appointment of a DeputyController, whose sole concern wall be to direct the production and output ofbrass. Every effort is being made to reduce the use of aluminium and copper bythe substitution of other metals with a view to assisting in overcoming theshortage of these metals. Considerable delay is being experienced in obtainingdeliveries of steel forgings.Sufficient quantities of Flax have now been released by the appropriateControl to enable contractors to proceed with orders in hand for heavy canvasgoods.   The outlook for future supplies is, however, a matter of concern.The situation has eased as regards &quot;hard&quot; hemp fibres (Manila and Sisal)and supplies appear to be assured for some months. &quot; Soft&quot; hemp, of which themain source of supply is Jugo-Slavia, continues to be the chief difficulty in this class of material.There has been some improvement in the Timber situation as orders havebeen placed, and freight engaged, for further considerable quantities of WesternCanadian soft woods. Offers of foreign-grown hard wood and English timberare now being taken up.V.Labour.The arrangements for bulk postponement of calling up of men employed bycontractors of importance to the Admiralty referred to in the last report and also those for the individual postponement of the calling up of keymen in other cases,are now in full operation.The exemptions of a number of Army Reservists expired on the 1st March.After application to the War Office extension until the 1st June has been granted in most cases.The R.A.F. are continuing to release small numbers of keymen. For example,during February 31 applications were made, of which 19 were successful, while37 out of 41 applications for extension of exemption were granted.While such procedures are preventing further large-scale loss of skilled labour from Admiralty Establishments and contractors, measures, such asTraining and Dilution, designed to augment the supply of skilled labour, have not* This figure includes some ships requisitioned by Government Departments, includingabout 100 requisitioned by the Admiralty as Mercantile Fleet Auxiliaries.
yet had any result commensurate with the need, and existing capacity is in manycases not fully employed. The shortage has already been referred to in earliersections of this report, and is particularly serious in regard to skilled electricalartisans and the specialised workers needed for the production of gun mountings,Fire Control apparatus and Asdics key items affecting the completion dates ofships under construction.As already stated in Section II of this Report, negotiations are proceeding with the War Office and Air Ministry with a view to securing the release of acomparatively small number (about 100) of keymen whose calling up has had avery serious effect on Asdic production. The possibility of taking similar steps in regard to some 300 men lost from the manufacture of Gun Mountings is underconsideration within the Admiralty.As far as Admiralty Establishments are concerned, negotiations areproceedings with the Trade Union side of the Shipbuilding Trades Joint council for an extension of dilution to other skilled trades besides those represented bythe A.E.U., and for the relaxation of certain rules of demarcation. The consentof the Unions is also being sought to the introduction of women to increase thesupply of semi-skilled workpeople. Steps are being taken, by relaxation ofcertain of the normal rules relating to the entry of workmen, to facilitate andexpedite the recruitment of Mechanics in Admiralty Establishments, andadvantage is being taken of the Ministry of Labour Training scheme to obtaindilutees.Among Admiralty contractors, too, a few informal arrangements have beenagreed between individual firms and unions, designed to assist the absorption of semi-skilled and unskilled workers into skilled occupations, or otherwise toincrease the effective use of labour for production. Such measures will, however,need to be employed on a much more extensive scale if the serious shortage insome trades is to be relieved.Some important Admiralty Contractors have reported instances in whichthey have lost the services of skilled workers who they claim have been led byoffers of higher earnings or other inducements to accept engagement bycontractors for other Departments. The introduction of some form of control to eliminate such competition between Government contractors for the availableskilled labour, and to secure a greater standardisation of contract conditions inrespect of piecework prices, bonus times, allowances, &amp;c, has been submitted tothe Treasury Inter-Service Committee for consideration, and it has been decidedto set up a committee of representatives of the interested Departments to dealwith this question.In not a few cases there are indications that the workmen, particularly themore highly skilled, are beginning to feel the effects of continuous work at highpressure, with an inevitable falling off both in quality and quantity of production.The prolonged spell of exceptionally cold weather this winter has enhanced theseeffects, and there has been a heavy loss of working hours through sickness.VI.Works.The abnormal weather conditions experienced during this winter haveseverely affected all outside works to a greater extent than normally allowed for.The adoption of brickwork in lieu of timber because of the shortage of the latter,makes the erection of surface buildings peculiarly susceptible to weather con-ditions. In addition to actual stoppage of work, progress has been affected bythe consequential disorganisation of transport systems, which in some casesresulted in materials arriving out of the required order of receipt. There hasbeen some compensation, in as much as the heavy frosts enabled heavy excavators,&amp;c, at FA.A. stations to overcome some of the delays previously experiencedwhen the ground was softened by heavy rains.Some shortage of labour has been experienced, especially in the Orkneys,at Invergordon and in some isolated districts in England and Wales. close co-operation with the Ministry of Labour and National Service has been main-tained with a view to overcoming shortages as they arise, and a substantial improvement in the number of workmen employed was achieved during February.Delay in the recruitment of labour to the major works at Caerwent Cordite
Factory, Trecwm Armament Depot. St. Merryn F.A.A. Station and Dean HillArmament Depot is occurring, pending the settlement by the National joint council of the Building Industry, in conjunction with the Works and BuildingsPriority Sub-Committee, of the wage conditions to be observed in these works.The shorter hours of daylight have also affected output. Night work underrestricted lighting conditions has been carried out where permitted by the appro-priate authority, but the output of work obtained has been relatively small, andin some cases definitely uneconomical owing to accidents and time lost in rectifyingerrors made during the night.
