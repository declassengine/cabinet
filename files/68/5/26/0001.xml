CANADA(1) General Position.The Canadian Parliamment reassembled on the 25thJanuary, when the Governor-General, the late Lord Tweedsmuir,announced that Parliament was to he dissolved and a GeneralElection held.      This announcement, which came as a greatsurprise, has been variously received:    with suspicion by theOpposition Leader, Dr. Manion - Conservative - who made abitter attack on the Government for planning a &quot;snap&quot; electionat a time of grave crisis.Mr. Mackenzie King, the Prime Minister, explained the reasons which had led to the Government decision to holdan immediate election.     The chief was the resolution adopted by the Ontario Legislature during the previous weekregretting that the Federal Government &quot;has made so littleeffort to prosecute Canada&apos;s duty in the war in the vigorousmanner the people of Canada desire to see&quot; which in mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s view had created a situation which madea new mandate imperative.     The election will he held beforethe end of March.(2) Naval, Military and Air -nativities.In addition to the two contingents of the Canadianactive service force which had already arrived in thiscountry, non-divisional units to the number of about 5,000arrived early in February.Steps are being taken to put into effect the EmpireAir Training Scheme.    71 Officers and 200 men of the Royal AirForce have arrived in Canada to assist in training, and thefirst

COHMQNWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA(l) General Position.Early in December the question was raised in Parliamentof providing certain increases in the pay of the militaryforces.     Eventually, certain advances were conceded, and aposition which at one stage seemed difficult was overcome.Mr. Menzies has explained privately that he agreed to compromisebecause an election on the army pay issue might conceivablyhave resulted in a Government defeat, and the risk of givingGerman propaganda a handle was too great.    In Mr. Menzies&apos;view, the present petty differences with, e.ga  the 0OuntryParty, and to some extent with the Labour Party, would vanishthe moment the war in Europe flared up,  or when there was abig air raid &quot;on the civil population at home&quot;.( 2) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Navy.Three further auxiliary mine sweeping vessels arefitting out and one auxiliary anti-submarine vessel ispreparing for service.      Ships under construction includetwo escort vessels, two tribal destroyers,  four local defenceanti-submarine minesweeping vessels and one oil fuel lighterof 1,200 tons.     According to latest available figures, the personnel of the Royal Australian Navy consists of 6,630 on active service and 4,195 in reserve.      124 merchant vesselshave now been armed.Army.The advance party of the Second Australian ImperialForce consisting of reconnaissance party of 6th Division and overseas

overseas base and personnel for training, left Melbourne onthe 15th December.      The first contingent of 1 Infantry brigade and attached troops, numbering some 6,600 in all, embarkedbetween the 9th and 11th January, and has now arrived inPalestine.By the 15th December enlistments for the SecondAustralian Imperial Force had just exceeded 20,000 all ranks.The United Kingdom Government have accepted an offer by the Commonwealth Government to provide certain technicalunits, namely a Railway Survey Company, three railway construction Companies and two Forestry Companies.Air.Since the outbreak of war, reconnaissance squadronshave been brought up in strength and efficiency by theposting and intensive training of reservists.    Seawardreconnaissances can now be undertaken in any coastal waters to a distance of 200 miles from the coast, and in the New&apos; - ;.;;:vl&apos;     .      &apos; &apos; -       &apos; - 1&apos;.&quot;.&apos; &apos; &apos;:&apos;&apos; &apos;:&apos;- ,. - &apos; 1 :   -Guinea and bolomon Islands areas by Empire flying boats.The details of the Empire Air Training agreement as now determined upon, represent a substantial modification ofthe original conception which envisaged the air training inCanada of all Australian trainees.     Most of the 26,000airmen whom Australia proposes to contribute will be trained inAustralia, only a few thousands going to Canada.      Of the26,000, 10,400 will be pilots and 15,600 observers, wirelessoperators and gunners.It is estimated that over a period of three yearsAustralia will spend  A50,000,000.Thirty-four new training schools will be established and

and there will be a substantial provision of additional aircraft.The United Kingdom will make a contribution of both engines and aircraft and will lend instructors to supplement the Australianinstructional staff.   A considerable charge will also be met bythe United Kingdom in respect of pay, allowances and pensions which will be at United Kingdom rates from the date ofembarkation for England,Talks with New Zealand Ministers resulted in furtherundertakings in relation to provision by Australia of.certain essential defence supplies including training aircraft.Manufacture of Munitions and Aircraft.New developments are the manufacture in Australia ofpredictor apparatus and directors for the location of aircraft and the direction of fire.     The manufacture of heavy anti-aircraft guns and of lighter anti-tank guns and trench mortarsis proceeding satisfactorily and. the output of fuses and artillery cartridge cases is increasing.The Bristol Beaufort Aircraft Manufacturing programme is being pushed forward with all possible speed.     Workshopsin New South wales, Victoria and South Australia are nearlycompleted, and orders have been placed for the required machine tools and other equipment.(3) Legislative Action.There have teen no particular developments.     parliament has adjourned until April.(4) Economic Action.Exchange and Import Control.Consideration is being given to economies in respectof

of non-sterling exchange for purposes other than imports,particularly of film royalties, and to the prohibition of importation   of superior grades of petrol motor cars.    exchange for imports from non-sterling countries is now being controlled by the system of import licensing to le put into effect onthe 1st December.    Balances abroad have markedly declined andthe question of taking over the remaining balances is beingconsidered.     Reports show that the net holdings of UnitedStates of America and Canadian Securities at the 5th Octobertotalled 17,000,000 dollars.     These were subject toencumbrances and subsequent sales which might reduce the totalby, say 25 per cent.Wool.The quantity of wool appraised by 51st december was computed at 1,470,000 bales, valued at  18,400,000 sterling.The quantity shipped totalled 800,000 bales.      Concern has been expressed at the delay in arranging sales to the neutralwool-buying countries, as it is feared markets might he lost andthe sale of substitutes encouraged.    A first shipment to Canadahas,  however, been arranged and shipments to America are about to commence.   Nothing definite has been heard from Japan, aconsiderable buyer in the past taking the years as a whole.Wheat.The position of wheat has continued to cause deepconcern.     Advances in&apos;world prices have intensified the hopethat enough shipping will soon be available to relieve the seriouproblem of storing upwards of 120,000,000 bushels.     arrangements have been completed for financing advances to wheat growers forthe present harvest,  involving the provision of  23,000,000.The

The problem of the disposal of the new wheat is intensifiedby the revised estimates v/hich indicate that the harvestwill be about 180,000,000 bushels.      Considerable  relief tothese difficulties should, however, result from the recentpurchase by the Ministry of Pood of 56,000,000 bushels of wheat and 150,000 tons of flour, representing an additional7,000,000 bushels of wheat.     negotiations have also been concluded for the sale to Japan of 200,000 tons of wheat on credit, and the purchaser will arrange monthly shipments.Dried Fruits.The Ministry of Food has offered to buy as a first purchase a total of 24,500 tons of various classes ofdried fruits.     The offer has been made on the understanding thatit will not prejudice negotiations concerning the disposalof the balance of the fruit.    Discussions are proceeding.Ships Bunkers Control.Legislation has been prepared to enable action tobe taken in regard to Bunker Control, etc. in Australianports when necessity arises.

NEW ZEALAND.(1) Genera 1 PositioruThere have heen no major political developments.      One,of minor importance, was the revocation of the appointment, asParliamentary Under Secretary for Housing,  of Mr. J.A. Lee(the leader of the &quot;Left Wing&quot; of the Labour Party)    owing tohis press activities, which, to the Government, &quot;conveyedimpressions incompatible with the mutual trust and loyaltyessential between those who work in close co-operation&quot;*     TheGovernment decision to ask for the revocation of Mr. Lee&apos;appointment was unanimous.      Mr. Lee, alluding to his futureplans, said that he &quot;may be able to defeat conscription, whichI intend to fight by helping to recruit to destroy Hitler&quot;.A Defence Liaison Officer in Australia has beenappointed,  to deal with questions of supply and to assist inthe co-ordination of defence policy between New Zealand and australian services.The New Zealand Parliament, which had adjourned untilthe 8th February,  has been prorogued until the 16th May,(2) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Navy.A programme of mine sweeping in approaches to certain parts has been carried out.      One trawler has been fitted out as an auxiliary minesweeper.      Three more vessels have beendefensively equipped.Army.The advance party of the New Zealand Special Forceembarked at Melbourne on the 15th December, and personnel ofthe

the first echelon of the Force embarked at Sydney and Melbournebetween the 9th and 11th January.    They arrived in Egypt on the12th February.    Increased rates of pay for all ranks while serving overseas have been announced.     The second echelon andthe Maori battalion have entered camps      Officers and N.C.O&apos;s  -of the third echelon are undergoing preliminary training, andit has been announced that only 753 men are still required tocomplete this echelon, and that sufficient men should be ready in a week.Following a request by the V/ar Office,  certain technicalunits (railway survey, railway construction and forestry)are in process of formation.Air.The training of the Air i-orce continues at an expanding rate;    applications for service are satisfactory.The construction of additional grounds and flying training schools is proceeding.( 3) Legislate-.Action.There have been no particular developments.(4) Leonomic Action.Shipments of wool and other primary products to theUnited Kingdom since the outbreak of war have exceeded the quantities for the corresponding period of the previous year.The various controls to regulate Dominion production continueto function satisfaotorily and total production gives evidenceof all round increase.     A Wool Advisory Eoard has been appointeIt has been announced that petrol rationing will bere-introduced as from the 1st February with a view to securing a

30/o reduction in consumption.Action has teen taken in regard, to control of bunkersupplies to specified neutral vessels and for the controlof German exports.-.

UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.(1) General Position.The new Parliament met on the 19th January.   ThePrime Minister had publicly expressed the view that the sessions should be as short as possible in order that the Government couldreturn to Pretoria and proceed with the work^ of implementingtheir war measures with the minimum delay.     Meanwhile,.. theOpposition parties, under General Hertzog and Dr. Malan, hadbeen unable to find a formula under which they could unite,though Mr. pirow had publicly stated that the differencebetween the Hertzog and Malan groups was &quot;so insignificantthat a magnifying glass would not find it&quot; - a view whichwould certainly not be accepted by the majority of theHertzog group.      In view of the strong debating strength ofthe Opposition the Government expected to have to meetpowerful attacks - which would probably be concentrated on thePrime Minister and on the Government policy in regard to thewar.     But General Hertzog&apos;s remarkable outburst in favour of union neutrality, in which he declared,  among other things,that the real reason for the war was the existence of a&quot;war party against Germany&quot;, and which went on largely tojustify the German actions to destroy the Versailles treaty,was received both in the House and in the country, with shock,surprise, embarrassment and anger.      It is said by the press that, with the exception of the residents of the Platteland,and other diehard haters of Great Britain,  the country as awhole almost unanimously deplores the speech.     Many ofGeneral Hertzog&apos;s own followers, and even the Malanite group,appear to have been almost equally embarrassed, whileGeneral Hertzcg&apos;s former supporters who have since followedGeneral Smuts

General Smuts received the speech of their formerleader with a &quot;bewilderment tings3 with sadness- at thechange of policy in a man who had so often proclaimedthe value to the Union of friendship with the UnitedKingdom.In the course of the subsequent debateMr. Pi-row was severely criticised by one member for hislack of achievement as Union minister for Defence *     Hehad given South Africa &quot;soldiers without equipment, gunswithout ammunition, an air force without aeroplanes&quot;,deficiencies which General Smuts was now engaged inremedying.General Smuts, in his reply, characterised hisformer leader&apos;s speech as &quot;sounding like a chapterfrom -Meih Kampf&apos;&quot;, and the House eventually rejectedGeneral Iiertzog&apos;s peace motion by 81 votes to 59*Although the Government majority has thus increased ascompared with that in September from 13 to 22, thisis not to be attributed to any defection from theOpposition, and the Government can at the moment relyonly on a normal majority of 19.      One outcome is thatin a joint statement, General Kertsog and Dr. Malanannounced that their parties had reached a &quot;basis ofagreement&quot; to unite under the name of the &quot;ReunitedNational or People !s Par^-y&quot;, on a formula which statesthat both parties are convinced that a republicangovernment separate from the British Commonwealth wouldbe best suited to the traditions and aspirations of theu e Li in i

South African people and the only effectiveguarantee that South Africa would not he drawn&quot;into Great Britain&apos;s wars&quot;.(2)    Payal. Military and Air. Activities.The Seaward Defence Force formed by the UnionGovernment took over from the Royal Navy anti-submarine and minesweeping duties on the 15th January.The total strength of all branches of theforces is now 2,300 officers and L7,000 other ranks.Several new Army units have been formed and it isexpected that a complete division will be equipped withmobilization clothing and non-fighting accoutrement bythe end of April and the whole mobile field force by theend of June.The strength of the Air Force is now 531officers and 5,050 other ranks.      Ih2 pupil pilots are under training.Arrangements have been made to send thirtymedical officers from the Union to complete medical fieldunits in Kenya.General Smuts has replied to the telegram sentto him with regard to the provision of Union forces forthe defence of Kenya intimating his readiness to despatchthree air squadrons as soon as the necessary material is available.      He has been informed, that, while every effort is being made to expedite the supply of material, some time must elapse before delivery in the Union.      The questionof the supply of aircraft for this purpose is beingconsidered in conjunction with that of supply for the

purpose of coastal reconnaissance by the Union Air Force,in which it is thought that the Union Government couldaffcrd very welcome assistance.The Union Government were informed, in replyto their offer to extend Union Air Force training-facilities to European British subjects in southern africa,  that this offer was much appreciated but that itwould be even more valuable if these facilities were also available to personnel and pupils from the UnitedKingdom.      General Smuts has agreed in principle soto extend the Union facilities.      Detailed arrangements are under consideration and it is proposed to despatchtwo or three experts to the Union to discuss matters with the Union authorities.( 3)    L ? gi s 1 a 11. ye Action.The Defence Act has been applied to South WestAfri ca.851 persons,  of whom 803 are enemy subjects, havebeen interned in the Union and 80 persons, of whom Hoare enemy subjects in South Vest Africa.The German s.-s. &quot;Hagen&quot; (renamed &quot;Ixia&quot;) , whichwas detained in the Union on the outbreak of war and brought before the Prize Court, is being transferred tothe Ministry of Shipping after completing a voyage toAden.The postal and telegraph censorship is operatingsatisfactorily, and a considerable volume of information has been brought to light as to trading with the enemyactivities and subversive tendencies of individuals.Goecial

Special control of imports and e xports is to beestablished as from the 15th February.(4) Economic action the Union Government have established a system of export and import control and will co-operate in contraband control, examination of vessels for enemy exports, bunkercontrol etc.

EIRE.(1) General position the death sentences passed upon two members of theIrish Republican Army in connection with the Coventry explosion of last August gave rise to a considerable agitation in eire against the carrying out of the sentences, andMr. de Valera himself made strong representations to theUnited Kingdom Government on the subject.      The UnitedKingdom Representative to i^ire has summed up the situationresulting from the executions to the following effect.Mr. de Valera, who made this an intense personal matter,has moved sharply to the Left.     His administration isunpopular and incompetent and his eyesight is failing fast.It is almost certain that the partition question will nowbe raised more vehemently, and more frequent acts of violencemust be expected..    The popular agitation against theexecutions v/as not completely genuine,  since many personsin Eire had open minds on the subject, but all thought itprudent to join in an appeal for clemency - some early andsome late.     While the position remains difficult anduncertain bir John Maffey docs not despair of other and morehelpful trends gradually gathering force.(2)  Naval,_Military and Air Activities.The first of the motor vessels ordered by the eire government from this country for coastal patrol work has been delivered.(3) Legislative action.There is nothing to report *
