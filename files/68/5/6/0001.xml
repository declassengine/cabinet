MINISTRY OF LCONOHIC      RFARLWeekly Report on action taken for the periodFebruary 4th - February 11th.1. War Trade Negotiations and relations with Neutrals.Good progress has been made this v/eek in thenegotiations with Denmark,  and those with Holland and Belgiumare also continuing satisfactorily.      It is hoped that it willbe possible   to conclude the Norwegian negotiations^in Osloshortly.      The nego&apos;negotiations with the Italian Government havereceived a severe check,  thanks to the refusal of signor mussolini to allow the sale of war material to His Majesty&apos;sO-overnment,  a proposal which formed an essential part of thearrangements suggested to the Italian Government.      The master of the Rolls is returning to London to report.2. The position in the various countries is as follows:-SWEDEN.3- The ordinary-day--to-day problems which have arisenhave been dealt with satisfactorily^vthj^xug^i^the standing commission.      Tor instance a satisfactory arrangement^r^has-beienreached through the Commission for the supervision of Swedishimports of lubricating oil,  and has made it possible to resume the issue of navicerts for this commodity.      The War trade agreement may he said to he working very smoothly, with theall important exception of Iron Ore.      There are more and moreindications that the Swedish policy as regards this commodityis, on the one hand,  to assure the Allies that they over-emphasise Germany&apos;s dependence on her Swedish imports of iron ore and., on the other hand,  to continue to make to germany the largest deliveries which the /Hied Governments will allowto pass without serious protest and reprisal.      These-,deliveries are., of course,  accompanied by frecuent intimationsto the Germans that any interference with Sweden will lead totheir immediate suspension.NORWAY/

NORWAY.;;. Mr. Hanbro has gone to Oslo with full instructions,after consultation with the French Mission,  to settle pointsoutstanding in connection with the Norwegian Trade Agreement.DENMARK.5. Good progress has &quot;been made with the negotiations-,the Danes recently have adopted a much more reasonable attitude and a satisfactory Agreement is in sight.      It isexpected,   therefore,  that negotiations for a Payments agreement will shortly be resumed.FINLAND.6. The wool required for the execution of government orders in Finland will be sold to the Finnish Government atU.K. home market prices.7- According-to.J.nforrnation received from the FinnishLegation in London,  great delays are experienced in.-the ship-ments of war material -to Finland.0. The Finnish Go vernmaat hav^expjce-ss-ed. -1o theMinistry of Economic Warfare their great appreciation of theassistance received from the Departments of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment concerned in granting of export licences and inthe expeditious passing of goods through the Contraband Control.BALTIC ST/TBS.9- The Commercial Secretary to His Majesty&apos;s Legationat Riga is shortly arriving in London in order to take part inthe negotiations with the Latvian Trade Delegation which isexpected in London on or about the 20th February.BELGIUM.10. Conversations have been taking place in Paris between theBelgian Government delegates on the one hand and the French andBritish Governments on the other with a view to clearing upoutstanding points arising from the War Trade Agreement.      InParticular, details of the proposed special agreements arebeing discussed.

TJjjJ NETHERLANDS.&apos;11. Negotiations with the Netherlands delegation con-   ,tinue.      The draft lists have now been agreed hy both sides.The texts of notes to be exchanged are now under consideration,SWITZERLAND.12. Discussions are continuing in Berne on the lists tohe attached to the AgreementsITALY.13. Our new proposals for a comprehensive settlement of outstanding questions were favourably received by Count Ciano,who undertook to submit them at once to Signor Mussolini.The latter, however,  subsequently instructed Count Ciano toinform Sir Percy Loraine that he could not consent to sales of war materials such as guns,  aeroplanes and bombs.      count ciano explained that Signor Mussolini&apos;s decision was basedpartly on the fact that he did not want :I mi sunder standingswith Germany&quot; and partly on Italy&apos;s own need for the  types of war material we were willing to buy.14. As substantial purchases of armaments were anessential part of the proposed general settlement, besides*being necessary in any case to assist in balancing the clearing, negotiations have been interrupted and the master of the Rolls is returning to London to report on the new situation which has arisen.15. It is satisfactory, however that,  in his lastconversation with Sir Percy Loraine, Count Ciano showedhimself as quite resigned to the stoppage of Italy&apos;s sea-borne imports of German coal.SPAINThere is no further news of any Cabinet re -shufflein Madrid, or that Sr.Suner is likely to take over theMinistry of Foreign Affairs or that of Finance.      Detaileddrafting of the Anglo-Spanish Clearing Agreement continues,and time/

and time has unavoidably been taken up with the reference ofnumerous points to London and the drafting of amendments.The Spaniards have objected to providing,  in the Clearing,for financial payments such as dividends and profits ofBritish companies operating in Spain,      They say that thestate of the country does not justify them in allocatingany of their sterling for such purposes.     We are standingfirm in our stipulation that provision for such paymentsmust form a part of the Agreement.17. It has been asked in Parliament why the FrenchGovernment have been able to conclude their Agreement with spain sooner than we.      The answer lies in the nature of theAgreements.      The French Agreement is simple in essence, pro-viding for an exchange of goods on agreed lists up to acertain value.      It does not,,  as ours does, provide for thepayment of outstanding debts, nor for the allocation ofproceeds under different headings.      We believe that thetime being taken in reaching our Agreement will be justified by its completeness.PORTUGAL18. The Portuguese Government&apos;s counter-proposals fora War Trade Agreement have now been received^      These proposalsenvisage an under talcing from us to &quot;use our best endeavours to supply Portugal with essential goods and to increase our purchases of her products.      They further include a schemefor exempting from the operation of our control Portugueseexports to and imports from Northern European countries ofcertain goods up to a certain amount in each case.      Theactual goods and the amounts have not. however, been specified.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador is of opinion that these proposals are unacceptable.      He suggests that the attempt to conclude a Jar Trade Agreement with Portugal should be abandoned and&quot;hat,/

that, instead of the export licensing system which we had asked the Portuguese to introduce, the Navicert system should&quot;be applied for exports from Portugal to the northern neutrals.19. The Portuguese proposals and His Majesty!s Ambassador&apos;suggestions are now being studied.YUGOSLAVIA20. . The Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decidedto send four experts to the United Kingdom for the purchase ofraw materials and other commodities arising out of the MineralsAgreement.     The Mission is expected to leave Belgrade after12th February and to arrive in London before the 19th February.EGYPT21. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo reports a growingagitation against our control over the export of eygptian cotton to &quot;dangerous destinations&quot;,  in view of the fact that american cotton to such destinations is not at present sub-jected to the same restrictions,      Sir Ivi. Lampson has recom-mended that His Majesty*s Government should purchase everymonth a certain quantity of Egyptian cotton in compensationfor stoppages by our export control arrangements.U.S.A.  &amp; SOUTHAMSRIC.A22. Further progress has been made in the study of ascheme for regulating the trade in raw cotton.23. A message has been received from Mr0Purvis sayingthat the proposed mission of experts in economic warfare cannow leave for Washington. The Mission will therefore leavein the ne ar future,2^-&apos; A request has been received from the ColombianMinister that the issue of Navioorts in Colombia should be started as sron ^? nos^i^le,II.CONTRABAND/

In 97 cases entire cargoes were released, either on first consideration or after enquiries,27.

It reviewed5 ships, ordered k to be released anr! Invited the India Officeto inform the Government of India of its opinion that oneconsignment by the s.s.  &quot;H00GKERK&quot;, destined for transhipmentin Calcutta,  should be placed in Prize,30, The Committee considered 1h5 applications for exemption, granting 5k, refusing 82 and deferring 9*    &apos; Inaddition/

The new procedure by which applications for exportpasses in respect of refugees&apos;&apos; effects are supported byrefugees&apos; relief-organizations in countries contiguous toGermany,  is now working.      Some of these refugees&apos;  appli-cations have been transmitted to the Committee by theseorganizations;    others, not so supported, have been referredto the organizations for information.      The Committee feelsgreat satisfaction that it has succeeded in arranging for collaboration with the relief-organisations;    its sympathieshave always been with genuine refugees who have been drivenby oppression to seek new homes, but is has had to envisagethe possibility that German agents may try to pass abroad in the guise of refugees and the further possibility thatgoods of small bulk and high value may be smuggled in vansand cases ostensibly filled with personal effects,  to be sold later to obtain foreign currencyc
