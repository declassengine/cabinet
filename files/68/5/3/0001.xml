In the margin beside the items are placed percentage figures showing their comparative importancein relation to the total propaganda directed to (1) the German home popula-tion; (2) Great Britain; (3) France; and (4) neutral countries. In bracketsafter each figure is shown the corresponding percentage for the previousfortnight.A table is then given summarising the relative importance of these various lines of propaganda.The events which exercised the greatest influence on German propaganda during the current fortnight were : (a) The official German replies to the French Yellow Book, issued on the16th, 18th, 20th and 25th January;(b) The Asama Maru incident on the 21st January;(c) Mr. churchill&apos;s speech on the 27th January;(d) Herr Hitler&apos;s speech on the 30th January.10813-3   [20775] j b
GermanBritain,France,Neutraly, 12% (8%)9% (10%)12% (11%), 91% (12%)The principal lines of German propaganda were, in order of their importance : (1) British Weakness;&apos;; (2) British Brutality and Unscrupulousness;(Followed at a considerable distance by)(3) German Strength;(4) Allied War Guilt.The most important changes were :-(a) A great increase in the theme of &quot; Allied War Guilt,&quot; in which forthe first time France shares full responsibility;(6) An increase in the theme &quot; Neutrals Oppose the Allies,&quot; reflectinga more positive attitude towards Great Britain.1. German Strength.The most important sub-division of this theme remains Germany&apos;simmunity to the British blockade, in support of which Mr. Cross andMr. Amery are mis-quoted, and the superiority of the National Socialisteconomic system. Herr Ffitler&apos;s speech on the 30th January, together withthe political fanfares which preceded it, were responsible for a sharp risetowards the end of the month in the emphasis placed upon the political unity of the German people under National Socialism.The normality of life in Germany, as shown by the Leipzig&quot; Fair and theWinter Sports at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, was contrasted with the cancellation of all normal activities in France and Britain. &apos;. . - &apos;Remarkably little emphasis was laid- on the military aspect of the factthat this time Germany is not fighting a two-front war.! Considerably less play than formerly was made with the support ofGermany&apos;s friends. Italy&apos;s ideological identity and natural sympathy with her Ally were given most attention, followed by Germany&apos;s cultural ties with spain. In contrast with the preceding fortnight, Russia was scarcelymentioned.Germany, 13% (13%Britain, 6% (6%)Franco, 41% (5%)Neutrals, 9% (11%)Germany, 6% (1%)Britain, 6% (2%)Franco, 31% (2%)Neutrals, 8% (3%)Germany, 25% (25%)Britain, 321% (31%)Franco, 19% (151%)Neutrals, 20% (25%)-2. Military Operations. , rt .,. ,In the absence of any important operations this theme remained at approximately the same level as during the preceding fortnight.The greatest part of this line deals with the sinking of British ships,especially by attacks from the air. The destruction of British shipping isby far the most important single item in German propaganda. It is pointedout that Britain&apos;s convoy system cannot protect either her own or neutral shipping.  The slogan remains &quot; The road to England is the road to death.&quot;There has been a considerable increase in &quot; Front-Berichte &quot; for home consumption, both in the Press and on the wireless. These consist of descrip-tion of life in the Front Line, patrol duty, &amp;c.3. Neutrals Oppose Allies.The remarkable increase in this line is due mainly to the Asama Manincident, and to a less extent to the protest of the United States against the censorship of mails and the detention of ships.The Asama Maru incident, together with its consequences, was treatedas a major event in the war and was given almost as much prominence asthe Graf Spee battle.While German propaganda was able to represent the neutrals asrejecting Mr. ChurchnTs appeal to &quot; join in the English war,&quot; it was unableto demonstrate that they had been driven into active opposition.4. British Weakness.    ,   ,This remains by far the strongest theme of German propaganda.The most important sub-division, except to Britain herself, continues tobe economic weakness.   It is interesting to note that British attacks on german financial stability were immediately followed by a strong counter&apos;offensive dealing with the &quot; inevitable inflation &quot; in Great Britain.
Emphasis, parallel with the dominant story in &quot; Military Operations,&quot;also laid upon lack of shipping, and especially of oil tankers. &apos;    -The story of British social weakness has gained further in importance, &apos;  -and now occupies nearly 11 per cent, of the whole of German propagandaw this country, to which it is especially directed. The main points in the attack were that &quot; The rich take profits, while the poor bear the sacrifices,&quot;!iml &quot; The miserable inadequacy of the allowances made to the dependentsof British soldiers and sailors.&quot; Great play was made with the meanness ofthe rate of old-age pensions, and with the lack of interest shown in the Houseof Commons debate on the subject.The fatal disunity in British political life was illustrated by the broadcast of doctored gramophone records of the interruptions duringMr Churchill&apos;s speech at Manchester. This is believed to be the first occasion on which German propaganda has used a recording of a Britishstatesman&apos;s speech. In propaganda for Great Britain these interruptionswere given less prominence than speculations about Mr. Hoi*e-Belisha&apos;resignation and divergencies inside the British Cabinet.^Dissensions in the British Empire were illustrated mainly by references to ^outh Africa, though surprisingly little capital was made out of GeneralHert7.og&apos;s speech.A story in a British newspaper was used to demonstrate that half of theBritish Expeditionary Force was laid low with influenza.The hopelessness of Britain&apos;s military position was held to be provedi bv Mr. Churchill&apos;s appeal to the neutrals to come to Britain&apos;s aid.5. French Weakness.There has been a notable decrease in this line in propaganda to France, Germany, 3% (3%)due, possibly, to the great increase in the theme of Allied war guilt, which p^aMe&apos; 6^/2%^has subtracted from the importance of nearly every other topic.There is an interesting divergence in emphasis. To Germany the stressis laid upon French economic weakness, snowing that France&apos;s financesI cannot bear the strain of the war, and that her agriculture and industry have been paralysed by mobilisation. In propaganda to other countries, andespecially to France herself, the emphasis is laid upon the miserable conditionof 1 he unemployed and the plight of evacuees.J6. British Brutality and Unscrwpulousness.The unusual decrease in this line of propaganda is due to a shift in Germany, 20% (24%)(attitude from &quot;The Allies are injuring the neutrals&quot; to &quot;The neutralsare opposing the Allies.&quot;-Britain&apos;s  desire   to  exploit   other   countries   is   demonstrated   byMr. OhurchiH&apos;s speech in Manchester and by her wish to extend the warfin all directions.Kngland&apos;s brutal conduct towards Germany since the Treaty ofVersailles was stressed by Hitler in his speech on the 30th January, andwas taken up with enthusiasm by all the commentators.After some pardonable hesitation the German propagandists have at last decided that the British Secret Service was responsible for the murderot the late Iraq finance minister.Considerable prominence was given to an article by H. G. Wells in an american magazine, recommending the aerial bombardment of German[towns.Hie German propagandists, for want of better alternative atrocities,aye resurrected the Re-port on Conditions in the Colonial Emyire issued in&apos;uly 1939.\v \      be siSnincaiit tnat for the first time it has been suggested that france, 6% (12%)Neutrals, 6J% (6%)Britain, 17% (23%).France, 13*% (14%)Neutrals, 22% (20%)e Welsh and the Scotch resent their exploitation and neglect at the hands ofe English.the 1fitan instance of the length to which German propagandists go in order a given fact into predetermined lines of propaganda, it was noticedrtl- an increase m Swedish customs duties was laid to the account of Great3rnain.in a broadcast to Germany, great indignation was displayed^ ine tact that flogging is still legal in Great Britain.[20775] &apos; B 2
7. French Brutality and Unsc?,upulousness.Gormany, 2i% (4%) The decline in French brutality is apparently due to the increase in$S% t$$    Allied war guilt.Neutrals, 4% (7%) In the subordinate themes of exploitation of the neutrals and the desireto extend the war, France was still coupled with Great Britain. Herr Hitler,in his speech of the 30th January, also made little differentiation betweenthe two countries.A few separate charges, however, were made against France alone.M. Daladier was accused of having adopted a &quot; brutal attitude &quot; towards germany in his speech of the 29th January. It was also suggested, as anafter-thought, that French officials were responsible for the outbreak of firewhich destroyed the Italian liner Orazio.8. Britain Lies.The main charge is still that Britain has concealed her shipping losses.Germany has shown herself unusually sensitive, especially in propagandafor home consumption, to the attacks on her administration of Poland whichhave been broadcast by the Vatican radio. She has accused the Vatican itself.France and Britain, in turns, of atrocity-mongering. A similar indecisionhas marked her reactions to reports of German troop concentrations inGalicia these being attributed first to Britain, then to France, and finallyto France under the orders of Britain.The A thenia pot was kept boiling by an indiscreet item in the british press.9. France Lies.This theme has also suffered, especially to France, from the increase ofinterest in Allied, and particularly French, war guilt.The more important charges referred to reports of German troop concentrations in Galicia, of conditions in Poland and of threats to the low countries. A Havas allegation that Jews in Warsaw had been compelledto burn their own Synagogue was strongly refuted.Germany, 6% (6%)Britain, 8% (71%)Franco, 6% (6J%)Neutrals, 6% (5%)Gormany, 1% (2%)Britain, 1J% (li%)France, 5*% (7J%)Neutrals, 2% (2%)10. Allied War Guilt.BrftTinny7%\i%?* ^e Srea^ increase in the importance of this theme was due to the france,&apos; 13% (3j%) publication on the 16th, 18th, 20th and 25th January, of the German repliesNeutrals, 7i% (4%)  to the French Yellow Book.The first two replies declared that France, after the Munich Agreement,had specifically disinterested herself in the problems of Eastern Europe. Onthe basis of this new French policy, the German-French declaration of the6th December, 1938, was brought into being. On this occasion Herr von ribbentrop clearly gave M. Bonnet to understand that the French militaryalliances in Eastern Europe were regarded by Germany as survivals ofVersailles, not to be accepted by a resuscitated Reich. This condition wasexpressly accepted by M. Bonnet, who explained that any public declarationsto the contrary were merely to be regarded as sops to an ill-informed publicopinion. As a matter of course France would engage in no policy in theEast which could disturb Germany. Under English influence Franceabandoned this policy in the Spring of 1939, and unleashed war in Europe.The third reply dealt with the utterances of M. Campinchi, whodeclared in April 1939 that France and England were ready for war, andthat the peace which would follow would be modelled more upon the Treatyof Westphalia than upon Versailles. France was resolved to go to war,not out of any sympathy for Poland, but in order to stop the german advance. It would be wrong to postpone the military decision, as time was working in favour of Germany.The fourth statement explained away M. Coulondre&apos;s reports in theFrench Yellow Book as being based upon subjective gossip no less than thoseof Sir Nevile Henderson.   &quot; We do not envy the French people this rnan.These replies, while stressed to all countries, were given extraordinaryemphasis to France. They occupied more than one-eighth of the total ofGerman propaganda to that country.

German War Aims.The only comment that can be made concerning German war aims is that even less was said about them in the current than in the previous fortnight.i;]. Britain Exploits France.It is interesting to note that the importance of this theme, in propa-i oanda to France, has declined during the past three months from 20 percent, to 4 per cent.  At the same time, the emphasis is moving from a passive[endurance by the French of English domination to an active resentment[against the &quot; historic enemy.&quot;Sarcastic&apos; reference was made to the refusal of the French authoritiesto permit their. English &apos;&apos; guests &apos;&apos; to import a pack of foxhounds for theirrelaxation.14 Germany Offers Friendship to France.This argument is being reduced to a sentimental appeal.   &quot; Germany Germany --\c___-p---.____j 1_____i.        __1__j ))     ct rpl,^__,-__-j?

It has been suggested to neutrals (i) that they should show more active resistance to the threats of Mr. Churchill;(ii) that it is not in keeping with neutrality to allow their press to print &quot;tendentious allied reports&quot;; and (iii) that it is un-neutral to sail in British convoys.(over)
