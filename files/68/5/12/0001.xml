Q-fQT?T.5^V. .P.(H)(40) 62 Copy no war cabinetI N D I AELEVENTH FORTNIGHTLY REPORT submitted by the Secretary ofState for India covering the period 1st-15th February 1940.(previous Report: W.P.(R)(40) 44)I.    general as the War Cabinet are aware from the telegrams whichhave been circulated to them during the past ten days, the conversation between the Governor-General and Mr. Gandhi on.5th February came to an end without result after one short imeeting.   As authorised by the War Cabinet the Governor-General expounded to Mr. Gandhi the plan on the basis of   &apos;whicfrhe had hoped to persuade the Congress Party to resumeoffice in the Provinces, which was substantially the offer made In his Statement of the 17th October, but Mr. Gandhithought the gap between his position and that of his majesty&apos;s Government too wide to make discussion profitable.In a statement published in the press the following day he explained that the vital difference between the Congressdemand and the Governor-General&apos;s plan consisted of thefact that the latter contemplated&quot;the final determination ofIndia&apos;s destiny by the British Government whereas theCongress contemplated just the contrary.There is evidently widespread disappointment in congress circles that accommodation was not reached, though-i1r&apos; J1nnah on behalf of the Muslim League in an interview with the Governor-General the following day did not conceal&apos; is own satisfaction.    It now seems improbable that any very

siecific change in the political situation will occur beforethe Conference to be held by the Congress in the middle of--arch, when the party&apos;s policy and plans will be discussed and redefined.   It will be remembered that if the proclamations under which the Governors of the &quot;congress&quot;provinces are at present exercising their powers are tocontinue in force beyond the end of April, resolutions mustbe passed in both Houses before that date approving theircontinuance.II. MILITARY affairs there is no change in the situation as regards the Armyor the Air Forces in India.III. FOREIGN AND FRONTIER RELATIONSAFGHANISTANThe Minister reports that a certain amount of pessimismis apparent as spring approaches owing to the fear that inorder to restore the prestige of the Red Army some easycampaign will have to be undertaken by Russia as an offsetto the failure in Finland and Afghanistan is looked on asthe likeliest objective.   This attitude however is notwidespread and the general attitude is increasingly infavour of the cause of the democracies while anti-Russianfeeling is growing.In recent discussions with the Minister in Kabul theAfghan Prime Minister expressed agreement with the generalscheme of training proposed by Brigadier Molesworth duringhls visit t0 Kabul (see the Report for the first half ofJanuary), but said that there would be some difficulties toIDGovercome before it could be put into force, as it wouldtaV&apos;&quot;&apos; tirne t0 accustom the army and the people generally toidea of British training.   He made a request for the

grant of credits for the purchase of armaments, which hesaid would demonstrate the sincerity of British intentions and Dave the way for the introduction of a training scheme.The Prime Minister also raised once more the question01 Russia and asked our Minister to obtain for him a cleardefinition of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s attitude andactions in the event of a Russian attack on Afghanistan.Our Minister is now on a visit to India and he proposes todiscuss the whole question further with the authoritiesthere.    I am in preliminary telegraphic consultation withthe Government of India and on receipt of their views andthose of the Minister will take up the question of the response to be made to the Afghan prime Minister.XCRTH WEST FRONTIERThe Shabi Khel section of the Mahsuds submitted onthe 7th February and the air proscription of their territory has been raised.   They furnished cash security fortheir fulfilment of Government orders announced to them inDecember.A Peshawar newspaper reports that on the orders ofBadshah Gul, a prominent tribal leader, the 19th ofJanuary was observed as a day of prayer for Turkey in thewhole of tribal territory.In the Bannu District there were serious incidents ontne main Bannu-Tochi road when a party of officers and other ranks in cars was ambushed by a gang.   One officer and aergeant were killed and three persons wounded while threemotor cars were burnt.   There were also three cases ofsnapping in the district.   The Government of India are proceeding with their preparations to give effect to the--proposal to send troops into the Ahmadzai Salient, which recently approved.   An explanation of their intentions&apos;&apos;G De8n Slven &quot;to the Afghan Government.   A brigade

reconnaissance towards the hills north-west of Bannu on12th February encountered a hostile gang of between 100 and200, on whom heavy casualties are believed to have beeninflicted.   Our own losses were one British Officer and oneIndian Other Rank killed, and 5 Indian Other Ranks wounded.ST^I^NG.The Consul-General has been informed by theAdministrative Commissioner in Kashgar that the provincial government at Urumchi have instructed him to inform the consul-General that his wireless station should be abolished within three months from the 1st February.    the consul-General has asked for an interview with theAdministrative Commissioner and will report the result ofthe interview in due course.IV.    INDIAN STATES.Since the New Year conditions in the Indian states have remained exceptionally tranquil, apart from someriotous demonstrations in Manipur in connection&apos; withprofiteering in rice which have ceased with the prohibitionof its export.The States are co-operating with the Government ofIndia in measures to prevent profiteering and were represented at a recent conference on price control.The question of establishing joint administrative services for groups of small States in such matters asPUD.ic health, justice and police has been under discussionssong the Rulers of the small States in the Eastern Statesagency and in the Standing Committee of the Chamber ofwinces.   Rulers individually view with much dislike the-ossibility of such measures being extended to their ownMinistrations.    But there is reported to be a growingo-iioion of the desirability of pooling resources to

effect improvements in the conditions of the subjects inthe smaller States.A sum of Hs.50-i lakhs ( 377,000) has already beencontributed by Rulers in the form of donations and afurther sum of Rs.34 lakhs ( 255,000) is promised in theform of recurring contributions to the Viceroy&apos;s- war purposes Fund.V.    ECONOMIC - RISE OF PRICES.In considering the question of prices in India it isnecessary to make two preliminary remarks.    In the firstplace the pre-war level of prices of agricultural commodities and other raw materials was, and had for years been, unduly low, both in itself and in relation to thatof manufactured and imported articles.   A substantial rise of these prices was required in the interests of thecountry as a whole and can without difficulty beijustified;indeed, it may be looked upon in the light of an economic recovery rather than as a movement which requires to becounteracted.   Secondly, a&apos;s the mass of the people depend upon the production of agricultural commodities and other raw materials and as, moreover, agriculture is still to alarge extent upon a subsistence basis, the ill effects of rising prices are comparatively restricted and fall uponlimited classes, such as those who produce cash crops&quot;hich happen to be subject to unfavourable influences,those who have fixed non-agricultural incomes and thosewho earn salaries and wages.   The latter classes havebenefited from the very low prices which have prevailedsince 1939 and it will be seen from what follows that fore most part Indian prices have not yet returned to the levels which prevailed before that year.    In thesecircumstances the consideration of price control in Indiad&amp; S0 far reiated largely to the margin between the

-rices paid to the producers and those charged to the consumers, and to the prevention of profiteering, thoughit is also recognised that interference with the upwardcourse of prices beyond a certain point may in some cases be justified or, indeed, necessitated, by the requirementsof supply for war purposes.Early in September there was an abrupt rise in anden instability of the cost of many of the necessities of life beyond anything that the conditions justified.   TheCentral Government gave the Provincial Governments power to fix limits to the rise.   In many provinces the need forutilising this power was not felt and the mere existence ofit was sufficient to check undue profiteering, and in someprovinces salutary action was taken.A conference of the Central and provincial governments and of the Indian States was held in october and at that time it was thought that the rise had been sufficiently checked and that a reasonably normal and stable level prevailed, with an exception in the case of medical supplies which have since been the subject of separate consideration.   Strong objection was raised to anyattempt to regulate the price of agricultural produce uponthe grounds outlined in the first paragraph.   The rise ofprices has, however, after this temporary check, continued the following figures, in which a comparison is made between the conditions of the present time and those of thelast war, will show.   As the level for August 1939 wasidentical with that for July 1914, it is possible to makea direct comparison between these two periods.

Calcutta Index figure for all ConmodJ/jitfls.La st War p-p 3c. nt maJuly 1914 -100 August 1939       &quot;-^0^-January 1915        110 September &quot; 114Average 1915        112 October     &quot; 1181916        128 November   &quot; 1311917        145 December   &quot; 137ti1918 176It is to be observed that although the index figurehas been rising more rapidly since the beginning ofSeptember than during the early months of the last war, thefigure for December 1939 (137) is still well below theaverage of the pre-slump years.    The annual average duringthe six years 1924/29 was 152; the annual average during the nine succeeding years was 95, which was the actual figure   &apos; -for the last year of that period, 1938.   Except in the caseof raw jute and jute goods, which have been particularlysubject to speculation recently, the prices of individual commodities included in this general index have beenkeeping below the level of the pre-slump years.   It Isprobable that the working class cost of living has not byany means risen to the full extent of the Index figure forall commodities.    In view of all this, it may be inferredthat the rise in the cost of living, provided it ismoderate and gradual, should have some way to go yet beforeproducing consequences of a gravely disturbing nature among those who are adversely affected by it.In view of the fact that the comparative stability ofprices which followed the rise soon after war broke out hasnot been maintained in spite of the measures adopted by theProvincial authorities, there is widespread doubt as to thea llity of the local administrations to check profiteeringwithout reinforcement.   Special difficulties, however, ariseom the constitutional division of authority between theal Governraent on the one hand and the Governments of6 Provinces and States on the other and from lack of

co-ordination between the local authorities themselves.With the object of overcoming these difficulties it isintended to hold quarterly conferences between the central and local authorities, and a second conference of this nature was held in the course of last month.   By thismeans it is hoped to keep the situation under periodicalreview and to co-ordinate measures so far as they may befound possible and desirable.VI.    FINANCEDISTRIBUTION OF REVENUES.     Under the existing scheme of distribution of revenues between the Centre and theProvincial Governments, the allocation of the proceeds of taxes on income is determined by an Order - in-Counc il of1936 (3.R.&amp; 0. No.676).    This was well adapted to normalconditions, but its operation in war conditions would havebeen highly inequitable.   The Provinces would have receivedunexpected, and disproportionately large, windfalls; whilethe Centre, with increased Defence expenditure to bear, andwith the prospect of a considerable shrinkage in itsmainstay, the Customs revenue, would have been unable toreap the full benefit from any taxation of war-timeincreases in income and profits, or to reap any benefit from the expected improvement In the profits of its ownState Railways.   A revised scheme, to have effect from thecurrent year, is accordingly embodied in a draft Order-in-Council which has now been laid before Parliament.   Underbis it is estimated that the Provinces will still receivesubstantially more than they would have received under theexisting order had peace conditions continued.:cp**MOND TERRACE, s.W.1. z.7th February 1940.
