COPY NO.WAR    cabinet food SITUATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOMFIFTH REPORT submitted by the Minister of FoodCovering the month of January, 1940, incorporating thereport on home production for the same period prepared bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in conjunction-with the Secretary of State for Scotland.W.

MINISTRY     OF     FOOD.REPORT ON SUPPLIES OF FOOD AMD ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFFS.1. The statistical position of supplies of food and feeding-stuffs is shownin the Appendix to this report.     Table I gives monthly particulars of bulkstocks since the outbreak of war projected to the end of April 1940, togetherwith the number of weeks&apos; supply on the basis of the estimated stocks in April.Table II gives particulars of supply, consumption and total stocks for Januarywith forecasts for February, March and April.     The data are based on all imports which are expected to arrive in the months shown, &quot;but no account has been taken of losses at sea and the allowances for delays in loadings or voyages may proveinadequate.     Since shipping tonnage has not yet been arranged for a large part ofthe April imports, the predictions for that month must be regarded as less reliablethan those for February and March.Matters of special interest in respect of the more important commodities are dealt with in the following paragraphs.2.     wheat.The sinkings of ships in January, resulting in a loss of about 55,000tons of wheat, together with continued delays, resulted in imports during that month being about 100,000 tons less than the estimate given in the Minister&apos;sfourth report.   While an attempt has been made in compiling the forecasts ofimports to the end of April (Table II of the Appendix) to allow for delays inarrivals, the allowance made may, as in the past, prove insufficient.    Moreover,the forecasts make no allowance for sinkings.   These two factors will, however, be partially offset by imports of wheat from France and Morocco, of which no account has been taken in the forecasts.     The Ministry has already imported about 100,000tons of borrowed wheat from France.     A purchase of 50,000 tons of wheat fromMorocco has just been made and arrangements have been completed for the loan of afurther 100,000 tons from France, about 40,000 tons of which should be importedoy the end of March and the bulk of the remainder in April./ The

AJ.The consumption, of flour in recent weeks has continued at a rate ofabout 116,000 tons of wheat per weekD     Assuming that bakers&apos; stocks of flourhave not declined substantially; and bearing iri mind that the Quantity of flourused in feedingstuffs for animals and for industrial purposes has &quot;been abovenormal, human consumption of flour has probably been about normal.     In orderto allow for the possible increase in human consumption of wheat, due to thedecline in the supply of other foodstuffs, the weekly quantity of flour used forall purposes during February-April has been assumed to be the equivalent of120,000 tons of wheat.     It is estimated that about 50J&amp; of the home-grown wheat sold (including sales for seed) was milled into flour in December and about 55fi in January.     The latter figure has been used as a basis of estimating the proportion milled in February-April.The reserve stocks of wheat and flour which declined from 1,181,000tons in mid-September to only 650,000 tons in Mid-November were increased by theend of January to 1,066,000 tons.     Reserve stocks at the end of March, 1940 arenow estimated at 1,495,000 tons or 12.5 weeks&apos;  supply.    It should be noted thatthis figure excludes stocks of flour which were held in mills and at ports on18th November and were not taken into account in the War Cabinet&apos;s instructionthat a 13 weeks&apos; reserve stock of wheat should be accumulated by the end of March..This instruction has, however, been interpreted as excluding only the stocks of flour (113,000 tons representing 155,000 tons of wheat) so held on 18th November;the subsequent increase in flour stocks is included.3.     ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFFS.Imports of maize during February-April are forecast at 53,000 tons perweek or 78^5 of the 1936/38 weekly average.     The forecast for April is based onthe Ministry1 s import programme, upon the full implementing of which the Ministryof Shipping have already made certain reservations.     As in the case of wheat,an attempt has been made to allow for delays in arrivals, but the allowancemade may, as in the past prove insufficient*    - The forecast makes no allowance for sinkings and is based on the understanding that the full programme shareof tonnage will in fact be allocated to maize and other feed grains./ Estimated

Estimated weekly consumption (49,000 tons) during February-April isbased on the Ministry&apos;s undertaking to allocate to distributors not less than2/3rds of the normal quantities.     The fulfilment of this undertaking is dependent upon the estimated arrivals during February-April being fulfilled, asstocks at the end of January were sufficient for only one week&apos;s supply.     the forecast of stocks at the end of April of less than 2 weeks&apos; supply, is based onthe assumption that the import programme will be completely fulfilled.     Theposition may be eased by the purchase of extra supplies of maize in the U.S.for early shipment.Imports of barley during February-April are estimated at only 50^ ofthe 1936/38 weekly average, i. e,, only 4,000 tons per week in February and7,000 tons per week in March, but 14,000 tons per week in April.     The latter figure is an optimistic one as it is based on the assumption that shipping willbe provided to lift in time for April arrival a substantial part of the 100,000tons of barley recently purchased from Algeria and Morocco.      Imports of barleyduring September 1939 to January 1940 were only about 50/o of normal and, inconsequence, the home grown barley crop was used at a rate in excess of normal.Total stocks of barley at the end of April are forecast (on the basis of weekly consumption in April of 29,000 tons) at only 5c4 weeks&apos; supply (80/d of which isestimated to be held by brewers) as compared with 22.7 weeks&apos; supply at the endof December.It is estimated that 50^5 of the 1939 oats crop in England and wales was still on farms   at the beginning of January as compared with 53/b in 1939.Supplies of oilseed cake, which are obtained partly by importation ofcake and partly from oilseeds and nuts crushed in the United Kingdom, havebeen considerably below normal owing to reduced arrivals of each of these commodities.     Consumption of oilseed cake is highly seasonal;   under normalconditions it averages about 140,000 tons a month, but is as high as 200,000tons in certain winter months.     The quantity available for consumption inrecent months was only 75^5 of normal and no improvement on this rate is expectedbefore April.     In the meantime, the stocks of oilcake are only at the minimumlevel necessary to maintain distribution./ Pending

Pending the completion of quarterly returns by manufacturers anddistributors, upon which future allocations will be based, the Port Area GrainCommittees have been instructed to allocate equitably two-thirds of the normalsupplies of maize, barley and offals to all c.i,f, buyers.     Country merchantshave been instructed to do the same, subject only to the implementing of theMinistry&apos;s policy of granting priority to dairy cattle.A special report on the feeding stuffs position has been submitted tothe Ministerial Committee on Pood Policy.4.     SUGAR.Imports of sugar in January were slightly higher than those indicated inthe Appendix to the fourth report, while consumption was lower,     In consequence,stocks at the end of January were about 50,000 tons above the estimate given inthe fourth report.     Since, however, the home production season has terminated and imports in February and March are likely to be appreciably less than the quantityconsumed, a decline in stocks appears inevitable.The rationing of individual consumers began on 8th January, but thecontrol of supplies to manufacturers did not come into operation until 1st February.The total consumption of sugar in January approximated to normal peace timeconsumption and showed a reduction compared with the earlier months of the war.The control of manufacturers will result in a further reduction of about 30,000tons a month, on the basis of the present scheme.     It is estimated that total consumption of refined sugar under full control will average 135,000 tons amonth compared with the monthly average of about 200,000 tons in 1935/37,     Inthis estimate of total consumption, exports are included on the scale of thepresent export programme, viz, 86,500 tons a year;    exports are normally 375,000tons a year.5..    MEAT.The full control of meat and livestock, preparatory to rationing, was put into operation on 15th January, 1940.     Within a few days producers were unable to market their stock owing to exceptionally severe weather and a widespreadshortage of fatstock resulted at collecting centres.     Normally a shortage ofhome-killed beef can be made up by increased use of imported beef, but the adverse road and rail conditions greatly accentuated the distribution problem,/ These

These difficulties were, however, only temporary;   more adequate suppliesof fatstock   are now coming forward and the internal distribution of imported meat is proceeding smoothly.Details of imports, consumption and the satisfactory stock positionare given in the Appendix to this report.The ratios of home-killed to imported meat consumption by civilians in February-April 1939 and 1940 are estimated as follows:-Beef and vealiiutton and lambPorkOffalEstimated consumptionFebruary - April;Of which % home-killed;1939318117513919402521375641193951.644.472.564.1194064.334.371.458.5Total52548653.056.2&quot;6. BACON AND HAM.Imports of bacon and ham in September-November were 9o76 of the1937/38 average.     This reduction, combined with the need to accumulate a working reserve, resulted in a drastic reduction of consumption.     during december and January, however, imports exceeded normal, while consumption,affected both by the increase of prices and, after 8th January, by rationing,did not reach expectations.     The full effects of the increase in the baconration from four to eight ounces a week (29th January) and the decrease in priceof 2d. a lb.  (5th February) are not yet fully known, but the need to limitstocks, due to the difficulty of keeping bacon in cold store, makes it necessaryto increase sales for the time being to 10,500 tons a week, compared with the,500 tons required to honour a 4 ounce ration and the Service requirements.Steps have been taken to reduce imports of bacon;   Denmark is being asked toreduce shipments, licences in respect of supplies from certain Balticcountries are no longer being granted and licences for Dutch and Swedishimports are being curtailed.     In addition, home cured supplies are being reduced temporarily by diverting more pigs to the pork trade.     These reductions/are

are unlikely, however, to become effective during the next two months and,although some expansion of demand may result from the rationing of meat,further steps may be necessary to achieve the desired limitation of stocks.An awkward dilemma had to he faced in the control of &quot;bacon:   IfDanish supplies had been forcibly cut off, the available quantities would nothave been sufficient to honour the 4 ounce ration, but if normal suppliesarrived f^rom that country stocks would reach embarrassing levels.     Tosafeguard against the danger of the former contingency, arrangements weremade to procure quantities in excess of normal from elsewhere.     Danishsupplies were not in fact seriously interrupted and in consequence excessivestocks have been accumulated.V.   MILK.Owing to favourable grazing conditions the production of milk inEngland and Wales was 9.8% and 5,7$ greater in September and October 1939respectively than in the same months of 1938.     In November-December 1939 and January 1940, however, the shortage of feeding stuffs and the severe weatherresulted in decreases of 1,6$, 2.1$ and 8.7% respectively as compared with thesame months of last year.Liquid milk consumption in each of the months September 1939 to january 1940 was less than in the corresponding months of last year - the decreasesbeing 5.7%, 6.2%, 6.2%, 2.4% and 2.7% respectively.     A substantial part of the decrease is attributable to the drop in demand under the IiLlk-in-Schools Scheme.Of the 419 million gallons of milk produced in September 1959 to january 1940, 113 million gallons or 27,1% were manufactured;   the corresponding figures for September 1938 to January 1939 were 415 million and 94 million or22,8/0,     The greatest increase occurred in the manufacture of condensed milk;the decrease in fresh cream was offset by an increase in butter production;the production of milk powder and tinned cream was substantially increased.The absolute quantity of milk manufactured was 45.9%, 39.6$ and 16.598 greater in September to November 1939 respectively than in 1938 - the increases beingattributable to the decline in sales and the inorease of production of liquid milk.In December 1939 and January 1940, however, the quantity of milk manufacturedwas 0, 8$ and 35.0$ respectively less than in the same months of 1938/39.In January 1940 the amount of milk manufactured dropped to the safety margin/for

for liquid milk, being only 9.5 million gallons as compared with 14.6 million in 1939.The reduction in the distribution of feeding stuffs to 2/3rdsof normal is likely to result in a further drop in milk production during therest of the present winter and the early spring.     This decline is estimated to be of the order of ISfa of normal-compared with 8.7^ in January 1940.8.    BUTTER AND MARGARINEDuring the past few weeks imports of butter have been considerably in excess of ration requirements and, on the basis of expected arrivals, arelikely for some time to exceed requirements at the present rate of consumption.A reduction of 25fo in the quantities to be bought from Denmark and theNetherlands is contemplated;   if this reduction is not made or if the rationis not increased, it will not be possible to provide storage for the rapidly expanding stocks.     Butter purchased by householders is estimated at about20 per cent less than the quantity (5,250 tons a week) required if everybodypurchased their 4 ounce ration.     This lack of demand is attributed in part tothe relatively greater increase in the price of butter than of margarine.    Itis probable that the shortage of supply and increase in price of butter wasreflected in increased margarine sales some weeks before the rationing of butter came into operation.     On the basis of the cost of living indexprepared by the Ministry of Labour the price of butter increased between 1st September and 1st January from l/5^d to l/6fd per lb. or 19 per cent, whileduring the same period the price of margarine rose from 6-^5. to 6^d per lb.or only 4 per cent.     Weekly deliveries of margarine from factories, whiehbefore the outbreak of war averaged about 4,000 tons a week, averaged duringthe six weeks to 6th January 6,200 tons a week.     There has so far been littleconcrete evidence of a further increase in demand for margarine attributable to the rationing of butter.     Provision has, however, been made for a production of margarine in February of 7,000 tons a week to meet a possibleexpansion of civilian requirements.During February the prices of the more expensive varieties of margarine have been raised from 6d and 8d per lb. to 7d and 9d per lb./respectively.

respectively.     The cheapest variety (5d per lb) is unchanged in price.The rise in price of the two more expensive varieties is due to advances in the cost of raw materials and increased freight charges.The occasion of the rise in price of margarine has been takento insist upon the vitaminisation of all margarine sold for domestic consumption.      In the past a proportion of the cheapest variety was notvitaminised.     Prom March onwards the degree of vitaminisation will be raised for all margarine to figures in excess even of those formerly adopted for theleading proprietary brands.    In consequence all margarine for domestic consumptionwill be at least equal in vitamin content to the best summer butter.9.   OILSEEDS AMD NUTS AND VEGETABLE AMD MARINE OILSDuring January imports of oilseeds and nuts were insufficient to coverrequirements and stocks were reduced.     This deficiency of imports is likelyto continue in February, but it is hoped to commence the re-building of stocks in March.     Vegetable oils, including the oil produced in this country fromimported seeds and nuts, are divided for manufacturing purposes into three categories, i.e., hard, soft and technical.     The hard and soft oils are edibleand are used largely in the manufacture of margarine and compound lard.     Stocksof hard oils have been sufficient, but those of soft oils have recently fallen to a dangerously low level.     A large part of the February imports will,however, consist of cotton seed and groundnuts for the manufacture of soft oils.The soft oil proportion of total stocks will thus be increased.     Supplies of oils for soap making are being maintained at slightly over the pre-war output.This figure is adhered to in order to produce the quantity of glycerinerequired for explosives.      Supplies of linseed oil (used largely for paint,varnish, linoleum and oil skins for A.R.P.) are small and the position cannotbe improved during the present month.     Heavy arrivals of linseed are,however, expected in March.     If the white lines on the roads are renewedthis spring the demand for paint (and therefore linseed oil) will be veryconsiderable&apos; and the availability of paint for other purposes (including theexport trade) correspondingly restricted.The total average weekly crushings of oilseeds and nuts, which were only 28,200 tons in January, are estimated at 34,500 tons in February and32,000 tons in March, which will not yield enough oil to meet demand, which/is

is above normal.     This deficiency of oil will necessitate a reduction onthe allocations to manufacturers other than those of margarine and cookingfats.      Insufficient shipping space has &quot;been provided to transport the amplesupplies purchased abroad, hut from March onwards the rate of shipment isexpected to increase.The British catch of whale oil during the Antarctic season isexpected to he about 130,000 tons and is likely to arrive in this countrybetween May and July.     Negotiations are proceeding for the purchase of theNorwegian and Japanese catches.      In the meantime, existing stocks of whaleoil are ample to meet expected requirements.10..   DRIED FRUITThe Ministry have agreed to purchase  1,300,000 worth of sultanas,figs and hazelnuts from Turkey.     A political purchase from Greece has so far been avoided by our agreeing to consider the position with the Greek Governmentshould Germany cease to buy a large part of their dried fruit crop.The bulk of the annual average demand for sultanas of 60,000 tons isnet during September-December.     Yet the Ministry has (including 10,000 tonsafloat and 10,000 recently purchased but not yet shipped) at present at least35,000 tons of Smyrna sultanas for sale before the new Turkish crop is harvestedin September next.     Moreover, negotiations are now proceeding to buy 15,000tons of Australian and 1,400 tons of South African sultanas and both Dominionsare pressing the united Kingdom to buy very much larger quantities.      In an endeavour to meet this burdensome supply problem an &quot;increase consumption&quot;campaign is under way which involves an initial expenditure of  28,000 onadvertising, the selling of sultanas at extremely low prices (e.g3 areduction from 8d to 6d per lb, for the cheapest variety) and co-operation withbakers and confectionery manufacturers to induce them to enlarge their consumption.     The commercial treaty with Turkey precludes the disposition ofany part of the surplus on the export market.     There is little or no hope ofconsuming during February-September 1940 the 50,000 tons of sultanas now heldin stock or about to be purchased, let alone getting rid of such additional quantitites as Australia and South Africa may send us.     The high naturalsugar content of sultanas, coupled with the enforced shortage of Californianprunes, dried peaches, etc., should, however, stimulate the demand for sultanas.

11.    CONTROL OF IMPORTSThe Ministry has a monopoly of the importation and distribution ofwheat and wheat flour, feeding grains, grain meal and offals,.all types of meat except poultry, game and rabbits, eggs, butter, cheese, tea, cocoa, sugar,oilseeds and nuts.     To strengthen or to increase the scope of the Ministry&apos;scontrols, the list of goods which cannot be imported without a licence unlessconsigned to the Ministry has recently been extended to include;   eggs, bacon and ham and lard, animal fats, dried fruits, meat and canned meat.     Theaddition of butter, rice and rice flour and sugar is under consideration.In case the importation of cheap potatoes should endanger the successful operation of the scheme to control and increase the production of home-grownpotatoes, steps have been taken to establish machinery for the licensing ofpotato imports.   The placing of commodities on the list of goods, the importationof which is prohibited, is frequently for the purpose of tightening controlsalready functioning.     The most important food items hitherto largely uncontrolledare fresh tinned and preserved fruit and vegetables.    It is hoped tointroduce shortly measures to control the importation of these commodities.Upon the completion of the plan to extend the control of home-producedmilk, the importation and distribution of condensed milk will be regulated.The use of starch for a variety of purposes is being examined with a view tothe adoption of import and distribution control measures.    Similar steps are contemplated in the case of rice and rice flour.     A scheme for the controlof canned fish is practically completed.     In order to increase consumptionof hazel nuts imported from Turkey it may be necessary to strengthen the presentpartial import control of other sorts;    a centralised form of control willprobably be adopted.     For the food products not already mentioned it isproposed to leave the control with the Import Licensing Department acting onthe advice of the Ministry of Food.     If later it should prove necessary,these articles will be added to existing or prospective schemes of controlundertaken by the Ministry.While the immediate purpose of extending controls to cover a wider range of commodities is to conserve shipping space and/or foreign exchange,the mechanism of control is in each case being adapted wherever possible tofacilitate interception of windfall profits resulting from the restriction of supplies./If

If the commodity is an essential article of everyday consumption it is unlikely that any form of indirect taxation will he imposed.     In some cases,however, e,g. most type3 of canned fruit, there is no good reason why theMinistry should make a profit hy increasing the margin &quot;between buying andselling prices,12.   NEGOTIATIONS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIESIn co-operation with other Government departments, the Ministry ofFood is continuously taking part in consultations on the political and other aspects of purchases from foreign countries.     Recently the Foreign Officeand the Ministry of Economic Warfare proposed that the Ministry of food should purchase up to  5,000,000 worth of Italian foodstuffs in addition tothe small amount already being imported from that- country.     The Ministry ofFood expressed the opinion that not more than  2,500,000 worth could conveniently he used in the United Kingdom market.     The plan is now in abeyance,since the negotiations with Italy have been suspended for the time being.   TheMinistry expect to reduce their purchases of both bacon and butter from denmark and, in response to a request from the Ministry of Economic Warfare, are making arrangements which will permit of the importation by Denmark of only sufficientfeeding stuffs to maintain her agricultural output at a level reduced by atleast the amount of the diminution in the Ministry&apos;s purchases.     A war trade agreement has been signed with Sweden; only a few details regarding the pricesof bacon and butter already purchased remain to be settled.     representations made by the Baltic States, arising out of the prohibition of imports of theirbacon, are under consideration.     Negotiations are under way for the purchaseof up to 80,000 tons of Norway&apos;s forthcoming catch of whale oil.   Representa-tives of the Ministry have participated in discussions on war trade agreements with Greece and the Netherlands and also on the purchase of whale oil from japan.     An interdepartmental committee, upon which the Ministry is represented,has had under consideration our economic relations with various countries inSouth and Central America.     These considerations have included a study of theinterrelation of the United Kingdom&apos;s purchases from and exports to thecountries concerned, the respective balances of payments and the question of relevant French imports and exports.     In addition, the Ministry has had/consultations

consultations with the other Departments concerned on the possibilities of pre-emptive purchases of substantial quantities of maize and animal fatsfrom the Balkans, regarding which full reports have been received from theMinistry of Pood&apos;s Mission of Inquiry appointed at the request of theMinistry of Economic Warfare.15.   ANGLO-FRENCH CO-OPERATION.The most important development during the period under reviewhas been the first joint session between the Anglo-French Food executive and the Anglo-French Shipping Executive, in order to satisfy the latterthat the programmes submitted from the British and French sides of the FoodExecutive could fairly be regarded as minimum programmes.The co-ordination of purchases is proceeding satisfactorily.    Thussome saving on tonnage for long-distance voyages (e.g. Australia) has been effected by the purchase, for early delivery to this country, of about150,000 tons of wheat and barley from Morocco and Algeria.     Efforts arebeing made to secure that as much as possible of the requirements of oilseedsfor both countries shall he obtained from the nearer countries of supply,e.g. British and French West African colonies, rather than from India, theStraits and the South Sea Islands.Joint purchases of meat are proceeding according to plan.     Themain difficulty as regards purchases in the Argentine - that of currency -has been to a large extent overcome by the recent concession by theArgentine Government of a special franc-peso rate for French meat purchases.The Anglo-French Food Executive have given serious attention tothe rise in chartering rates for neutral freight, due mainly to thecompetition of individual shippers in the freight market for commoditiesnot controlled by either of the two allied Governments.14.    SHIPPING.The tramp tonnage requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping isfilling the gaps in the January-February loading programme of cereals in north America and of sugar in Cuba and the West Indies.     But the concentration of early tonnage in these near sources of supply has led toa deficiency in more distant areas, particularly South Africa and the east coast of India.     The ships now being requisitioned for these longer voyages/will

will not be ready for loading till March.The principal shortages in the January-February loading programme will be in cattle food and oilseeds;   these should be largely made up inMarch. Shipping has been obtained to lift the whole of the West Africanground-nuts crop, but the liquid oil position is still very difficultowing to the shortage of January-February tonnage in Alexandria and theMadras Coast.The Ministry of Food have chartered 28 neutral vessels, themajority of which are either carrying wheat from the Danube to France, in replacement of the loan of French wheat to this country, or are small ships still engaged in the transport of this French wheat from northern France to the United Kingdom.     It is hoped to secure someAmerican shipping to move Australian wheat to North America for shipmentby British vessels to the United Kingdom.15.    CPU STORAGE.The position is not free from anxiety.     The change over fromchilled to frozen beef, the accumulation of reserve stocks of meat,butter and bacon, and the irregular arrivals are imposing a very considerablestrain on the available cold storage space.     By a system of closer stowage,the space occupied by each ton of produce has recently been reduced.The erection of the additional five million cubic feet of space,recently authorised, is proceeding, but the new stores are unlikely to beready for use for about nine months.     Cold storage owners in theWest of the country have been invited to make proposals for the extensionof their stores with assistance from Government funds, but schemes ofthis nature are unlikely to produce a substantial increase of availablespace in the near future.On the present estimates of reserve stocks the available spacewill be just sufficient. No margin exists for any loss of cold storagespace from enemy action or other cause.16.   PRICES.The Ministry of Labour&apos;s Index of retail food prices for february 1st showed an increase on the month of 4 points or about/2-g- per cent.

2-g- per cent.     The greater part of this increase was due to a rise inprices of beef, principally of imported beef.     Bacon, fish, cheese, eggs and potatoes also contributed;   in the case of the latter three commoditiesthe unfavourable weather conditions during January had a considerable influence.As far as can be ascertained there is unlikely to be much changein the general level of retail prices during the present month.     The Indexwill he affected by the reduction in the prices of bacon, averaging2d. per lh., and also by the increase in the prices of the dearer brands of margarine, both of which took effect on February 5th.     Some further increase in the price of cheese and potatoes is possible but not certain.At the worst the net effect of the above changes would be an increase ofabout .8 of a point on the Food Index.     The average prices of meat, however,may also show a rise since certain cuts (principally British beef andBritish legs of mutton) are at present selling below the maximum price.If all these prices rose to the maximum the Food Index would increase by afurther .6 of a point so that a total rise of about 1-g- points seems possible.The approximate weekly amounts of the subsidies, which are being paid on certain staple foods, and their estimated effect on the Index of retail Food Prices are as follows:- 000&apos;s Estimated effect onRetail Food Index.(Points)Bread ) 480 3.9Flour ) 2.8Home killed meat 320 2.0 to 2.milk 235 2.1Imported cheese 12 0.51,047 11.1 to 11.8In addition the reduction in the price of bacon on the 5th Februaryresults in a loss to the Ministry estimated at  80,000 a week.     Its effect is to lower the Index by from .75 to 1 point.It should he noted that the Ministry&apos;s net losses on meat are confined to home produced meat, a small loss on imported beef being made good by a profit on other imported meats; and that on milk the paymentrepresents the estimated average cost of the present three months subsidy tothe Milk Marketing Boards.

REPORT ON FOOD PRODUCTION(By the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in conjunction withthe Secretary of State for Scotland)14th February, 1940.Ploughing up Campaign.The original expectation for England and Wales was that 1,500,000 acres of grassland would &quot;be ploughed up as part of the war-time task.     The minimumwar-time task communicated to County Committees was 1,350,000 acres.     Of this1,350,000 acres, all hut 20,000 have now been selected for ploughing, anddirections to plough have been served on farmers in respect of 1,015,000 acres.Applications for the  2 per acre grant cover 950,000 acres, of which 750,000corresponds to the war-time task.     In Scotland an increase in the tillage area of260,000 acres was aimed at.     Farmers have indicated their intentions to ploughup 245,000 acres under the grassland subsidy scheme.     This figure includes someploughing which does not represent a net increase in the cultivated area.     InNorthern Ireland applications for grant cover 190,000 acres compared with a war-time task of 250,000 acres.Six weeks ago it was roughly estimated from local enquiries that inEngland and Y/ales the acreage which would be actually ploughed by March 31st mightbe 50,000 - 100,000 acres short of the minimum task of 1,350,000 acres.Unfortunately the prospect has become since then less favourable.     The latest estimate of the progress of the various Committees in Scotland suggest that theprobable increase in the cultivated area in 1940 may be in the neighbourhood of210,000 acres.The arrears are due to weathei- conditions.     Excess rain in October and november, sustained frost and, heavy snow in January, and periods of frost inDecember and February have together constituted one of the most unfavourablewinters for pj.jughing for many years.     Not only have frost and snow hinderedploughing up, but they have also retarded normal arable operations, seriously damaged the late sown winter wheat, so that much of it will need resowing, andspoilt large quantities of potatoes and fodder.     The position may be retrieved inApril to some extent.It would now seem that the 1940 United Kingdom wheat crop cannot besafely estimated at more than the 1939 crop.     Prospects for an increase in sugarproduction are also disappointing, though the rate of contracting between farmers and factories has improved a little of late.1.

Machinery and Implements.The tractors and implements required by County Committees for springploughing and cultivation are now being distributed.     Some equipment has lately been requisitioned in anticipation of a rush of work in March,     Steps have beentaken to establish a Government reserve of binders (reaper-binders) and threshingmachines.     With this reserve and the machines already in the hands of farmers andcontractors it is expected that there will be ample supplies to cope with the harvest.     The supply of other equipment such as carts and trailers is underconsideration.Man Power.The Service Departments have agreed to the release in Great Britain for various periods of 900 key men, 250 of them for an indefinite period.     7,500applications for postponement of calling up have been received.     The War office are considering applications for extension of releases previously allowed whereweather conditions have held up farm work.Among the proposals being examined in conjunction with the Ministry ofLabour for meeting the additional demand in the summer are schemes for &quot;holiday-farming&quot; camps for schoolboys and for facilitating the placing of boys leavingpublic and secondary schools in agricultural employment.     The possible use of theWomen&apos;s Land Army for seasonal work is also under consideration.     The number onthe registers of the Women1 s Land Army in England and Yfales is now 15,000 - 16,000,of whom 3,200 have been placed in agricultural employment during the War.     Afurther 1,400 are available at any time,     Farmers1 demand shows some signs ofincreasing, especially for women who can milk.When recent decisions of the Agricultural Wages Committees become operative, the average minimum wage in England and Y/ales will become 37/5d. ascompared with 34/9d. on September 1st.     In Scotland no increases are yet operative,but they will in due course range between 5 and 10 per cent.     Some measure ofagreement to a compromise solution to the question of national versus local wagedeterminations has been reached after discussions between farmers and workers inEngland and Wales and a Bill has been drafted for early introduction.     In Scotlandthere is less feeling in favour of national regulation.Seed and Fertilisers.With a view to safeguarding the supply of seed for spring sowings,farmers have been asked to estimate the quantities of cereal seed they will need to reserve as much as possible of their own grain, and to place orders for the balance.

Trade organisations have given undertakings to assist in distributing seed oatsevenly and at a reasonable price.     200,000 bushels of seed oats have been purchased by the Government from Canada as a reservec     Exports of cereal seed to3ire are being limited.As regards fertilisers, the sulphuric acid position (which reacts uponsupplies of superphosphate and sulphate of -ammonia) is not very satisfactory.Although acid plants are working to full capacity it may be difficult for them tomee-c the needs of agriculture during the next three months unless special steps canbe taken.     Supplies of superphosphate have also been adversely affected by delays in shipments of phosphate rock, though there has recently been some improvement.Sxdphate of potash is in short supply.Feeding Stuffs.In spite of increased supplies of feeding stuffs becoming available in thelatter part of January, complaints from farmers (particularly poultry farmers)continue to be numerous.     Complaints formerly related mostly to cereals and cerealproducts, but farmers with cattle are now feeling the effects of smaller arrivalsof oilseeds and oilcakes.     Continued shortage of these products will reactadversely on the milk supply.     There is also an inexplicable shortage of wheatoffals, which is being investigated,During the past month M.F. &apos; s and the Agricultural Departments have been subjected to growing pressure from poultry farmers.     The heavy imports of eggs inJanuary and their effect on prices of English eggs are also being criticised.     Thepoultry industry is urging that it would be more economical of foreign exchange and shipping to import more feeding stuffs and fewer eggs.     The position is underreviev/-.Livestock.The scheme for the purchase of fat stock by the Ministry of Food has onthe whole been well received.     Criticism is mainly devoted to the prices for fatcows and the grading of calves.     The possibility of modifying these items is being examined.     The initial dislocation of supplies was aggravated by transport difficulties due to weather conditions, but marketings are increasing and shouldshortly reach more normal levels.Milk Production,In England and Wales milk supplies in January 1940 totalled 72,3 million gallons compared with 76.4 millions in December, 1939, and 79.2 millions inJanuary 1939,     Comparing the two january , liquid sales declined by 1,8 millions3,

and sales for manufacturing (including farmhouse cheese) &quot;by 5,1 millions,,     Thedecline in total supplies was due to severe weather, insufficient and irregularsupplies of purchased feeding stuffs, and possibly to a slight extent, an   increasein slaughterings of cows,     The decline in liquid consumption may also beattributable to transport difficulties due to the weather.     In the main Scottishscheme the total supplies in January amounted to 7,6 million gallons, and comparedwith January, 1939, there was very little change in total supplies or in liquidconsumption,,Short Term Credit.Under Clause 24 of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous War Provisions) bill Scheme has been prepared for the supply to farmers in England and Wales of seeds,fertilisers, implements, feeding stuffs, silos and contractors&apos; services forploughing, cultivating and harvesting.     In order to qualify a farmer must need therequisites to comply with directions of the County Committees, and have been unable to secure them through normal channels owing to lack of funds.     Repaymentwill normally be after harvest, with a rate of interest of 5 per cent.     It is notyet known how many farmers will desire to use this scheme,     The question of similar arrangements in Scotland is under urgent consideration,,Miscellaneous.County Committees have been authorised to take possession of 5,934 acres in England and Wales, and 290 acres in Scotland, for the purpose of securingbetter farming.     Existing tenancies are being terminated in respect of 3,178 acresbeing badly farmed.     Procedures have been worked out for facilitating thesubstitution of cattle and sheep for deer and grouse on sporting properties andfor the burning of heather (for purposes of improvement).     The difficulty of persuading the Service Departments not to requisition fertile agricultural land,unless this is essential, is becoming a source of widespread grievance.Animal Health.In the last six weeks there have been eight outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, involving the slaughter of 896 head of stock, of which 663 were salvagedfor human consumption.     During January and in the first nine days of Pebruarythere were 459 outbreaks of swine fever;    the improvement during December in respectof this disease has not continued.
