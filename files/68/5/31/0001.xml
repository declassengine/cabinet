THE REGIONSAgreement has been reaehed with the three major political parties and they will now co-operate with the Ministry in propaganda on the HomeFront.In accordance with Cabinet Paper W.P. (&amp;)(Zt.0) 41 plans are beingmade, in collaboration with the Air Ministry and Ministry of Home&quot; Security,by which Regional Information Officers will be authorised, subject tocertain oonditions, to provide the local press and public with informationduring the interval between the occurrence of air raids and the issue of official bulletins.22 Regional Advisory and Local Information Committees are now in being and plans are urgently in hand for the organisation of public meetings.HOME INTELLIGENCEThe Home Intelligence Section will soon be in operation;   it willprovide a useful barometer of the trends of public opinion.BROADCASTINGOn January 7th the B.B.C. introduced an evening programme for theForoes, extended on February 18th to twelve hours daily.     The method of radiation, designed to avoid guidance to enemy aircraft, does not givefirst-cjlass reception.In the Home Programmes two new series - &quot;Onlooker&apos; s&quot; weeklycommentary and &quot;Under tho Nazi Rule&quot; - have been started with a view tocountering German broadcasts in English.       Various other propagandafeatures are being planned.New low-powered transmitters are to be erected to serve the districts where, owing to synchronisation, reception has been badlyaffected.COMMUNICATIONSPress rates, which will result in a saving of  12,000 per annum,have been introduced for outgoing and incoming news telegrams sent orreoeived by the routes of Cable and Wireless Limited to a number of centres in the Near and Far East and in Latin America. ,The Italian national, news agency, Stefani, has agreed to take

Reuters-Leaf ield-Atlas Service to Europe and the Near East, andOaaervatore Romano has applied to Stefani for it.A greater wordage was carried by Reuters at Government expenseduring January and February, part of it being French news and backgroundmaterial to further the cause of Anglo-French co-operation.5.     FILMSSince January thirty-two films have been commissioned showingvarious aspects of British war aims and effort.     Some are primarilydesigned for foreign or Empire distributions.       Three are completed;most of the others will be released within a month.The selection and quality of newsreel material has been improved.Nearly all the leading producing companies in this country, bothBritish and American, have been persuaded to produce films presentingwar effort and aims in a favourable light.6.     PRODUCTIONA publicity campaign has been undertaken on Road Safety (forthe Ministry of Transport) and one is in preparation on Evacuation(Ministry of Health and Board of Education).During the months of January and February 394 new featurearticles were produced (average weekly despatch of copies 5*247) and 1493photographs, of which 125^32 copies were supplied in all.     The average weekly despatch of all articles was 128,000, compared with 60,000 a week in December.The circulation of &quot;Noteworthy&quot; has risen from 3,000 to 10,000and is now to be increased to 15,000.7.     FOREIGN (other than U.S.A.)A.   GeneralSeveral publicity themes have been worked out for developmentthrough talking points telegraphed to Press Attaches, pamphlets andarticles, photographs, films and broadcasting.      In some regions all, in others only some, of these means can be employed in giving publicity toany particular theme.

The following are the themes underlying current work:-Britain&apos;s armed strength.Scope of activities of Royal and Merchant Navies putting lossesat sea into proper relief.Unity of British Empire.Earnestness and unity of Britain&apos;s war effort;   reaction torationing, support from Labour, etc.Anglo-French co-operationFrierKuyemphasis on increasing collaboration of neutrals.Misleading nature of British unemployment figures.Advantages to neutral shipping of the convoy system.Necessity for contraband control of materials and of german exports, and for the arrest of German travellers of military age.Strain on German economic system.Illegality and inhumanity of German sea warfareFar-reaching character of collaboration between Germany and SovietRussia, especially as regards threat to Finland.Inconsistency of German propaganda.German attempts to sow discord among neutrals.While topics have special area importance as in the Low countries the defence of Contraband Control and in Greece and other maritime countrieBritish power to protect shipping, the main theme everywhere is the certainty of allied victory.In addition to these themes, emphasized whenever possible,other themes have been chosen for intensive treatment in a regular campaignThose now being developed in this way are:-Germany&apos;s repeated threats and broken promisestowards neutrals.Ideological similarity between Germany and SovietRussia (&quot;Communazism&quot;).Britain&apos;s financial and economic strength.British social services.Conditions in occupied Poland.Subversive and extra-legal activities of the nazi party abroad.

The following activities are of special interest:-(a) Cinematograph vans in France are about to begin tours with sufficient films for three months.(b) The scheme by which British newspapers for Franoe, Switzerland,Hungary, the Balkan States and Italy are sent by air to Paris came into operation on February 12th, and has considerably accelerateddeliverleo.(c) A pamphlet, &quot;The War at Sea&quot;, has been produced consisting mainly of photographs and pictorial statistics, with captions in sevendifferent languages.     80,000 copies have been distributed, andarrangements have been made for its commercial publication in France.B. Broadcasting.Daily broadcasts in Bulgarian began on February 7th and inSwedish on February 12th.     Arrangements for broadcasts in Norwegian,Dutch and Finnish are well advanced, while those in Hindustani only await the formation of a staff unit.     Additional broadcasts in Arabic andGerman are pending.The Joint Broadcasting Committee continues to prepare and supply scripts and records for use by foreign -broadcasting systems, andhas started new features in Hungary, Sweden, Jugoslavia, Denmark andBrazil.Treasury authority has been obtained for a capital expenditureof  210,000 and a running cost of  U3,C30 a year, to instal and operate at Droitwich an 800 kilowatt medium wave transmitter.     This will be in working order in nine months1 time and will provide good service to theContinent in hours of darkness.C. EffectLOY/ COUNTRIES Save in its comments on the First Lord*s reference to neutrals, the press in both the Low Countries has been favourable, especially in respect of photographs, of which from three to five British are printed for every one Ger lan.SWITZERLAND In Switzerland the press in uniformly favourable,though the Censorship is severe, and Germany has inspired

protests against the predominance of Allied News.    BritishBlue Books are selling well, that on German ConcentrationCamps being particularly popular.     The B.B.C. broadcastsunhappily are poorly received in Switzerland.SCANDINAVIA Estonia.     The Press Bureau at Tallinn has hadremarkable success in getting material into the strictly-   controlled Estonian press, while the position in Scandinaviagenerally is reflected by the admission in the HamburgerTageblatt of 22nd December, 1939, that the news from Londonappears on the first page (of the Norwegian papers) in heavytype while German news is regarded as less important and is placed on the inside pages and even then as unobstrusivelyas possible.THE BALKANS The Hungarian press does not reflect the pro-Alliessympathies which predominate among the people; in Greecea strict censorhip.: fails to prevent an openly favourablepress tone and much British material is printed in disguisedform; Croatian newspapers are outstanding in the generalfriendliness shown by Yugoslavia; both in Hungary and in bulgaria the objective character of B.B.C. news is recognised and approved.ITALY Unlike the national broadcasting service, which gives the news with reasonable fairness, the Italian presscontinues hostile to the Allies, both in the presentation of the news and in comment, though some implicit criticism of German policy can be detected in leaders by Ansaldo,Editor of the Ciano family newspapers, and by Gayda.    Maybethe official bias only holds in check a spontaneous antipathyto Germany and that Russia has to some extent replaced theAllies as a target for ridicule.     Prance is more popularthan Great Britain.     About three out of five of thecommuniques issued by the Embassy Press Bureau are printed,many in several newspapers, and British photographs are getting improved publicity.      The recall of Barbato,

correspondent of the &quot;Popolo d&apos;Italia&quot; in London, hasremoved one channel of most hostile reports.     Comment onthe broadcast news talks in Italian is conflicting, complaints of boredom and bad reception being balanced by appreciativereports from widely separated provinces.SPAIN .        Such publicity as can be undertaken in Spain isprobably beneficial.      In the last two months the circulation of the Embassy Press Section Bulletin has risen from 2,500to 6,000 copies a week, and an ultimate figure of 30,000 isPORTUGAL expected.      In Portugal more and more material is getting into the press.      In both countries there is need of furtherchannels for publicity, and commercial possibilities arebeing examined.     The increasing sales of both editions ofthe &quot;Tangier Gazette&quot; are encouraging.LATIN AMERICA The requests for material for Latin America, the generalstate of opinion there, and the reports from British Missionsprove that a high percentage of material supplied by theMinistry is used with good effect.     One of the two Nasipapers started in Buenos Aires has ceased publication.MIDDLE EAST In the Middle East the publicity machinery is runningwell and at an increasing pace.     In January 5*409 copiesof 154 separate articles were sent out, as against 1,846  inDecember;    the figures for photographs were 12,019 (copiesof 258 separate subjects) and 4,914 respectively.FAR EAST In the Far East the Germans appear to be losing the initial advantage secured by the greater power of theTransocean wireless news service and the exciting storieswhich, in the first weeks of war, they could release in large quantities.      The public are beginning to prefer themoderation and restraint of the 3.B.C. announcer and to appreciate the superior reliability of Reuter.

8.     THE UNITED states in the United States of America where politics are disturbed bythe charges and counter-charges prevalent before a Presidential Electionthe policy of no propaganda is still maintained.       Controversies suchas the neutrality zone, contraband control, diversion of American shipsinto the war zone, mail censorship,., cessation of tobacco purchases havegiven rise to unfavourable editorial comment.     One way to deal with thisis to explain all the factors composing the British case to Americanpressmen in London so that they can help to correct any editorial bias due .to irritation at our measures.      The reports received weekly from the censorship Bureau on the tendencies observed in press cables to Americaare definitely favourable.In pictorial publicity, British and Allied pictures are nowbeating German pictures by two or three to one, whereas in the first eight weeks of the War, the Germans had this field almost to themselves.9.     THE BRITISH EMPIRE.  With the close collaboration of the Dominions, Colonial andIndia Offices, a large scale campaign of publicity about the Empire athome and in foreign countries has been undertaken.As a first step, the supply of news from the overseas Empire isbeing increased;   for example, the news sent by Reuters to London from india will be expanded from 2,000 to 6,000 words per day.The Empire Division has collaborated intimately with theColonial Office in securing publicity for the White paper on colonial development policy.Mobile cinema vans have been despatched to Kenya, Nigeria andthe Gold Coast; and a scheme has been submitted to the Colonial Officewhereby audiences in the Colonies will be shown Ministry films within afew weeks of their production.The Transcription Scheme for distributing records throughoutthe Empire for broadcasting locally is now in full swing.

RELIGIONS DIVISIONThe Division emphasises three main themes in its publicitymaterials -  &apos;The unanimous support given on moral grounds by the christian Churches in this country to the nationalcause.The spiritual issues at stake in the war.The attitude of the German Government to Christianity,The circulation of News Letters and bulletins issued by the division to various denominations at home and abroad, continue   toincrease;   the Catholic Newsletter in Spanish has risen from 2,500 to6.^000 copies per issue.      There is considerable cumulative evidence thatthese bulletins are achieving their purpose.     They are widely used in theneutral i^eligious pjsess and significant attacks have been made   upon themin two German religious journals.Arrangements have been made to distribute every month a pamphletdealing with the moral issues of the war to. 45,000 clergy and ministers at home.The Division Is encouraging the visits of British Church leaders to neutral countries:    the Dean of St. Pauls, for example, is leaving onMarch. 1st on a five weeks tour of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Holland.
