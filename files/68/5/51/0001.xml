NOTES.1, The severe weather conditions and the heavy rate of sicknessamongst v/orkers caused by the influenza epidemic had serious effects on production during February, particularly in the case of ammunitionfilling, and there is no prospect of the loss of output being made good.As an example of the dislocation involved, the conditions at the royal ordnance Factory, Chorley, may be cited.     There was practically nooutput from the factory for a week, and during the first two or three days after the main snowfall little more than 250 workers out Of thefactory total of over 6,000 were able to get to work.     Drifts inside thefactory were in places as high at 9 ft. and the available labour was employed for a number of days entirely in clearing away snow.The dislocation of transport had its most serious effect inintorference with supplies of materials, and the loss of production inthe filling factories and elsewhere is liable to be reflected in the delivery figures for many weeks to come.Construction work at the new Royal Ordnance Factories hasalso again been set back owing to severe weather conditions.2. The number of Brcn guns accepted exceeded 2,000 for the first time in any month since production began.3. The figure for deliveries of .303&quot; type S.A. ammunition for january included a bulk consignment from India.4. There was a temporary reduction in the deliveries of heavymachine gun ammunition for February, in part due to the interferenceof work for Finland.5. Production of explosives and propellants during February was again affected by loss of capacity at the Royal Gunpowder Factory,Waltham Abbey.     Good progress has, however, been made with thereconstruction work and it is expected that the production of nitro-glycerine will be resumed about mid March and that full production will soon be reached.6. Progress in the deliveries of light tanks is still slowowing to delay in production on transfer to new Marks.7. There has been continued interruption in the production of infantry tanks owing to difficulty in obtaining materialseB. The deliveries of wheeled vehicles have been held up by weather conditions.     The shortage of steel for wheels, to which reference was made in the Report for January, has been largely overcome, but theprovision of materials of all kinds especially of all alloy steels, is becoming increasingly difficult.9. The manufacturers&apos;  rate for the delivery of trucks, 15 cwt.4-wheel, has been deliberately slowed down on an anticipated shortage oftyres.10. Deliveries of many engineer and signal stores have been held up during February owing to sickness, and transport disorganisationcaused by severe weather.     In some cases work actually stopped owing todifficulty in obtaining fuel.     In others firms had up to hfifQ of theirpersonnel absent.

11. The hold-up in deliveries of assault boat3 in January, causedby difficulties in obtaining canvas, has now been overcome.12. The programme of deliveries of transport bridges is nearing completion.13. The low figure for deliveries of wireless sets No.9 is dueto time lag in deliveries ocming forwrrd from new contracts.14. The reduction in the deliveries of respirator facepieces andcontainers during Pebruary was mainly due to heavy sickness amongemployees.15. The whole of the requirements of greatcoats has now been purchased and contractors who have been undertaking this work willswitch over to the production of battledress and Denim overalls.16. The number of firms receiving contracts for making upbattledress and Demin overalls has been greatly increased and will boincreased still further when firms switch over from the production ofgreatcoats (see para.15 above).17. There has been a reduction in the deliveries of certain types of web equipment stores, including waist belts, but a substantial increase in the deliveries of others not included in this statement.18. In all over 900,000 blankets have been shipped to Prance andthe French have stated that their requirements of blarfcets are, forthe moment, satisfied. Further orders for 1,500,000 blankets havebeen placed and the position is causing no difficulty.

Scarcity of shipping has roiaained the chief difficulty in maintaining adequate supplies of raw materials.     During the first sixmonths of the war stocks of many important materials have been substantially reduced, but it is hoped that with bettor weather it will bepossible to increase our imports sufficiently to neet current needs, ifnot to restore stocks.Further steps have been token to reduce home civil consumption in order to safeguard supplies for Service needs and for the exporttrade.     The civil ration for wool has.been reduced to about 50/o ofthe normal, paper deliveries have been reduced to rSOyb of the normalexcept under licence, and the quantities of iron and steel, copper andzinc licensed for civil use are being propressivcly reduced.Some of the more important materials are specifically dealt with.below.Iron and Steel.Meetings have been held with representatives of the French.Department of Public Works to discuss the supply position of the oresused in the Iron and Steel industry.An order has been made increasing the maximum prices of scrapby amounts varying between 5s and 10s with some adjustments to higherfigures in certain cases.The iron and Steel programme for 19A0 has been examined by theJoint Production and Materials Priority Sub-Committee and therequirements, totalling 18 million ingot tons, have been reducedprovisionally tc balance the estimated supply of 15*000,000 ingot tons.The cuts made included the dessation of supplies for Anderson shelters.The decisions of the Committee have been referred by the Chairman to the ministerial Priority Committee;CopperiThe Rhodesian cox^per producers have undertaken to supply anadditional 100,000 tons of copper within the next 18 months on very favourable terms, and the consent of the Treasury is now awaited to theacceptance of this offer.     If, as is expected, from 60/70,000 ton3 ofthis extra production become available during the current year, the total supply of copper for 1940 (including scrap) will amount to about 600,000tons, which just balances the latest estimated requirements for this year.Nickel.Since the conimencement of the War considerable quantities ofnickel have been passing into neutral countries, and it has beendecided that the time has arrived when the imports of this importantmetal should be rationed.     The International Nickel Co., the Mond NickelCo. and the Falcoribridge Nickel Co. have agreed to the limitation of their imports to European neutral- countries on the basis, with certainadjustments, of their imports during 1938 and 1939, and the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare, in collaboration with this Ministry, are now working outdefinite quota figures.     The quotas for Italy, Hungary, Japan and russia present considerable difficulties and are receiving special consideration./Aluminium.-lO-

Aluminium.The plans for the extension of plant by Aluminium Ltd. ofCanada have now been agreed and it is expected that this will &quot;bring usan additional 48,000 tons of metal during the second year of war.provisional agreement has also been reached about theextension of the British Aluminium Company1 s works in this country,Factories with capacities of 2,A00 and 10,500 tons will be erected atKinlochleven and Swansea;    the costs, estimated at  200,000 and  800,000,will be borne by the Ministry, which will be the owner of the works.The Ministry will also contribute two-thirds of the cost of a newalumina plant at Newport.TiruA large tonnage of Bolivian and Nigerian ore arrived in january and the figures for that month show an export of 1,235 tons of tin.The total for February is likely to bo still larger.Sulphuric Acid - Pyrites^ ^cid Sulphur and Regular Sulphur.Sulphuric acid plants continue to run at their masdmumcapacity.     There have been some releases of pyrites from Governmentreserve stocks to maintain plants pending arrival of shipments.     Smalladditions to plant have been made by one or two manufacturers of theirown initiative and a substantial addition to the productive capacity inLancashire is under discussions in view of our dependence on imported sulphur and sulphur bearingmaterials, several investigations are in trairi with a view to increasing the indigenous production of such materials.The supply position for regular sulphur, owing to delay inshipments, is still precarious.Molasses.In view of the shortage of tankers, it has been found impossibleto lift molasses from Java, Hawaii and India.     In these circumstancesauthority is being sought to purchase our imported requirements fromCuba.     In view of the fact that neutral tankers would have to bechartered from Java etc.,   this change of source of supply will not result in any additional commitment in foreign exchange.Timber.The soft wood supply situation remains serious.     At thepresent rate of shipment, with all possible economies and the use of alternative materials, stocks will be dangerously low by June.At a meeting of the Joint Production and Materials PrioritySub-Committee it was decided that additional allocations of soft woodshould be made to certain Departments, to meet the needs of indirectGovernment requirements and the export trade.     In order to avoidincreasing the total of the allocations previously given, an all round outof 10^ was made.In order to reduce the demand for shipping from the PacificCoast, arrangements have been made to rail timber from British Columbia/to

to Eastern Canadian ports.     It is hoped to carry some 20,000 standardsa month by this method.Leather.The reservation of leather for service requirements is now-proceeding smoothly and is being extended to assist the export trade.Exports of dressed leather and footwear are increasing andwere well above pre-war averages in January.Flax.A further review of supplies and requirements during the first year of war has been mo.de hy the Joint Production and MaterialsPriority Sub-Committee and it seems probable that the requirements for essential home use, the Northern Ireland export trade and part of theDundee export trade will be met.     The supply position does not allow of linen goods being xaade for the non-essential home civil trade.Following the agreement with the French a material reduction has been effected in the prices of Belgium flaxes.     The Eire Government haveagreed to reserve the 1940 production for the United Kingdom at thesame price as has been guaranteed to Northern Ireland.Further quantities of seed for 1940 cultivation in the UnitedKingdom and Eire have been ordered and statutory maximum selling prices in Northern Ireland have been fixed.Paper.The collection of waste paper and rags is being stimulated.Supplies of wood pulp hove not come forward well owing to weather conditions in the Baltic, whilst lack of shipping space for esparto grassis placing the mills using that material in a serious position.CottonaThe Control of the Cotton Industry (No.4) Order was made on the9th February, and from the 19th February, when it came into force, theCotton Controller has been issuing &quot;preference directions&quot; in favour of(a) Government orders and (b) export orders.     The procedure appears to boworking smoothly, and experience so far suggests that full use will bemade of the system so as to ensure deliveries for Government and export orders.Rubber.The United States Government have agreed to the suggestion thatthe period for the shipment of rubber, under the Cotton/Rubber BarterAgreement, should be further extended until September in order to avoidundue pressure on supplies during the second quarter of the year.At the same time the International Rubber Regulation Committeehave fixed the quota release for the second quarter at 80 per cent.     Atthis figure production should be sufficient to allow a substantialaddition to world stocks.     Shipments of rubber from the East to theUnited Kingdom, during February, were above average monthly consumption.

n p f.300SALVAGE.Military Salvage.Authority has &quot;boon given for the formation of a secondreception depot to serve the Southampton area, and a site has been selected at Stcventon near Didcot,It has been decided to open a branch in Paris to deal withsales of army salvage not to be returned hone.Civilian Salvage.The returns of municipal salvage work for January (so faras received) show sales totalling over  35.000. The corresponding figures for December and November were  32,000 and  29,000 respectively.Continuous stimulus was applied to Local Authorities for theintroduction or extension of salvage schemes.     A strong letter was addressed by the Ministers of Health and Supply to the Mayors&apos; of the29 Metropolitan Borough&amp;j   there was an encouraging response.The Lords Lieutenant have been invited to help by writingpersonally to each Local Council in their counties and to the localPress. .  The replies received indicate that over 30 Lords Lieutenanthave taken such action.During February 118 additional Councils reported the startingor planning of salvage schemes in their areas.     The total schemes in operation represent approximately 30 million of the population and themovement is daily gaining momentum4(intd.)      E.L.B.The Adelphi, W.C.2.23rd March, 1940.G.694.
