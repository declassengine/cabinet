S.W.I.8th March, 1940.

MONTHLY REPORT (No.  7) BY THE AIR ministry on SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION.Aircraft.1.       The output of aircraft in this country during the monthof February,  1940, was 719 as compared with the planned output of857, and, in addition, 58 aircraft were delivered from the UnitedStates.      The deficiency on the planned programme was due to bad weather, which caused a great deal of sickness among operatives,interfered with their travelling, and rendered a number of aerodromes   unusable for the flight testing and delivery ofcompleted aircraft0      Having regard to the very abnormal conditions*the output is creditable to the industry.2,       Additional orders were placed in this country during themonth for 300 aircraft.     Since the outbreak of war, 19,700 air-craft have been ordered in this country, 190 in Canada and 1,300in the United States, at an estimated aggregate cost of  419million.3.      &apos; The following are the more important measures approvedduring February to increase capacity for the production of aircraft:-(i)    The works of Cunliffe Owen Aircraft Ltd. near Southampton^which were established as a commercial venture for themanufacture of civil aircraft, will be extended and equipped by the Air Ministry for the production ofTornado (fighter) aircraft, at an estimated cost of 227,000.(ii)    The London and North Eastern Railway Company areundertaking the assembly of fuselages for Swordfish(torpedo spotter reconnaissance) aircraft in theirworkshops at York, which will be adapted and equipped for the purpose by the Air Ministry at a cost ofapproximately  15,000.

(iii)    The new factory at Blackpool to be managed by Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd. for the assembly of Wellington aircraftmanufactured by sub-contractors was described in the fifth Report (W.P.  (R)  (40) 23, para. 3 (ii)).      It is becoming increasingly necessary, in developing largesub-contracting schemes, to provide some balancingplant or machine tools, and the provision of  100,000worth ofnplant for sub-contractors working inconjunction with the Blackpool factory has now been authorised, as a first instalment,(iv)   A.irspeed Ltd., who are to manage the new factory atChristchurch for Oxford (trainer) production&apos;(W:P,  (R) (40) 23, para,.3 (i)), are being provided withplant and machine tools costing approximately  12,500for manufacture of the jigs and tools required fortheir greatly increased rate of output,(v)   Among schemes for the expansion of sub-contractors&apos;capacity authorised during the month may be noted thedecisions to provide plant and equipment within a totalexpenditure of  65,000 for the manufacture of sphericalroller bearings by the Skefco Company at Welwyn, and toprovide plant costing approximately  19,400 for themanufacture of high pressure joints by the BritishErmeto Corporation at Maidenhead.Engines.4,       The following are the more important measures approved! sduring February for expanding the production of aero-engines and accessories to meet requirements of the aircraft programme:-(i)   Additional buildings and plant costing approximately 391,000 have been authorised to increase the productionof carburettors for Bristol types of aero-engine by the shadow factory at Oldham.

(ii) Plant costing approximately  21,000 is being providedfor the A.C. Company to increase their production ofsparking plugs.(iii)    The capacity of Messrs.pyndham Hewitt, at Staines andSlough, for the production of controllable cooling gillsfor Bristol aero-engines, will be doubled, the firmproviding the necessary additional floor space and services and the Department providing the additionalplant required, estimated to cost approximately  22,000,.Equipmento5.        The position with regard to the supply of a number of types of aircraft instruments was reviewed during February, and approval was given to the provision of additional plant and machinery to enable production to be increased by the followingfirms:-   M.R. 0. Ltd,, at Enfield (for automatic controls, 17,000);    Mabie Todd &amp; Co., Harlesden (for bombsights,  2,100);the Salford Electrical Instrument Company (for gunsights, 49,000;    for engine speed indicators,  1,860;    and for altimeters, 7,590).Armament.6.        The supply of Browning .305&quot; guns was reviewed and itwas decided to provide additional buildings and plant at a costof approximately  470,000 to. increase, by 2,000 guns a month,the output of a sub-contracting organisation managed by B.S.A.Guns Ltdn      This scheme is being planned so as to be capableof producing .5&quot; guns if they are required instead of .503&quot; gunsat a later stage of the aircraft programme.      Expenditure of 460,000 was also approved for the provision of additional capacity for the production of Browning gun barrels and sparesby B.S.A, Guns Ltdr, and their sub-contractors,/*1 o     * * *

7c        Having regard to the difficulty of providing sufficientcapacity in this country for the production of 20 ram. HispanoSuiza cannon guns,  the Canadian Supply Board are being asked.toplace an order for 3,000 guns with a view to the creation of a supply of up to 500 of these guns a month from the Ottawa GarManufacturing Company,    Canada.    Only a limited amount of balancingplant is required by this firm, and no capital expenditure by theUnited Kingdom Government is involved.8,        During February,  the Air Ministry agreed to providebuildings and plant costing approximately  598,000 for ParnallAircraft Ltd,, and plant costing approximately  175,000 forDaimler Ltd,,  to increase their production of Fraser-Nash types of gun turret,    Machine tools costing approximately  14,000 arealso being provided for Integral Auxiliary Gears, Ltd., whomanufacture the oil pumps by which these turrets are operated.Fuel.9.        Negotiations have been completed with TrinidadLeaseholds for the creation of capacity for&apos;35 million tons of100 octane fuel per annum in Trinidad, at a capital cost of 3 million.Raw materials.10,       Light Alloys.    Negotiations are in train with the objectof diverting two 1,500 ton extrusion presses,  one to France and oneto this country, which are at present being manufactured,  partly in England and partly in Belgium,  under Russian contracts.11.        Additional plant costing approximately  70,000 is being provided for High Duty Alloys Ltd., who are to manufacture lightalloy forgings and extrusions at Distington.

12.       Steel.    The present capacity of this country for theproduction of high grade steel tubes, made from electric furnacesteel, must be at least doubled if the requirements of theaircraft programme are to be met.    Proposals are under discussionwith the Ministry of Supply and the firm concerned.13.       Supplies of Swedish electric furnace steel will be insufficient to meet requirements and British steel must be usedto an increasing extent.    During February,  the provision ofadditional buildings and plant costing approximately  70,000was approved to increase the output of electric furnace steel bythe Clyde Alloy Steel Company.14.        Timber.    A new factory is being provided and equippedat a cost of approximately  200,000 for the production of aircraftveneers and plywood by the Aeronautical Panel and Plywood company at Lydney, Forest of Dean, and an investigation is being under-taken into the possibility of increasing veneer cutting capacity in Canada.Total Capital Commitments,15.        The capital commitments incurred at the expense of AirVotes for the creation of productive capacity have been increasedby  22 million to a total of  124 million.Summary.16.
