Some of the information inthis report has already appeared in the paper W.P. (40) 120 circulated by theSecretary of State for Air.BE.April 13, 1940.REPORT ON PROPAGANDA BY LEAFLET IN GERMANY, AUSTRIA,THE PROTECTORATE AND POLAND BY SIR CAMPBELLSTUART. G.C.M.G., K.B.E.IN all the reviews I have furnished of the work of my Department I have included an estimate of the results achieved by our leaflet propaganda. It hasbeen based on reports from the S.I.S. and on others from my own agents abroad,from the more trustworthy German emigre organisations, from travellers returned from Germany, and from incidental sources of various kinds. At first theevidence was scanty; but as time has passed, it has become fuller and moreconclusive. I therefore feel that, in the light both of greater knowledge and experience, I should attempt more fully to answer the question whether the efforts of my Department to weaken the resistance of Germany by the dissemination of propaganda from the air are, in fact, proving successful.Dissemination of Leaflets.The activities of Great Britain in regard to propaganda of this kind have,of course, been on a larger scale than those of either her ally or her enemy.  TheFrench have produced leaflets in considerable numbers, but they have notdistributed them in equivalent quantities.  We, on the other hand, have produced10982   [21146] b
and distributed 71 individual leaflets, and the monthly totals of our dissemina-tions over enemy territory by aircraft and balloon have up to date been : September         ............ 20,250,000October   ............... 5,360,000November          ............ 4,027,000December          ............ 2,164,000January............... 5,623,000February           ............ 8,064,000March &apos;............-      ... 20,254.000April 1-6          .........       ... 736,00066,478,000N.B. The disparity in these figures is due to operational and weather conditions.A German &apos;&apos; A pproach.&apos;&apos;The Germans also have followed our example by adopting leaflet propagandaby air as a weapon of war, though for reasons of their own, which are possiblyfear of our defences and petrol shortage, they have directed it against France,and not against Great Britain. They have also in some cases imitated the exacttypes of our productions. It is one of many indications that they find our propaganda methods far from ineffective. Indeed, an interesting report recently received from the S.I.S. suggests that they feel themselves to be getting the worst of the propaganda warfare in the air. It states that a person who has for years been in touch with the Nazi hierarchy and is known by it to have connexions withGreat Britain lately received a courier from one of its leading members, Avhomade the following proposal:  &quot; It is unworthy of the great traditions of the British and German Air forces to use them for the rather low business of propaganda. If the R.A.F. will desistfrom droj^ping tracts, the German Air Force will also stop dropping leaflets onFrance. If not, the German leaflet-dropping campaign will be intensified andBritish airmen flying over Germany will one day have a very unpleasant surprise.This will cost the British a lot of valuable lives and machines. A tacit gentle-man^ agreement should be reached to stop this propaganda from the air.&quot; the recipient of this message felt that the importance attached to our propagandaflights in so high a Nazi quarter was most significant.Enemy Anxieties.The reason for the German Governments disquietude at the recent increasein the propaganda activities of the R.A.F. are set forth in another Secret Report,which has greatly interested me. It points out that the Chiefs of the german air Force, from Goring downwards, had so strongly assured the German people,and even more significant, their party organisations, of their security from enemy air attack, that they have found themselves in a serious dilemma. Either theymust lose face or they must embark on air conflicts over important industrial centres which, in addition to the noise and excitement they would cause, would entail a serious loss of time and interfere with the much-needed rest of workersalready overstrained. Reassurances addressed to the Hitler Jugend to the effectthat one day the whole British Air Force will be annihilated, are beginning to lose their effect, while the S.A. are criticising the German Air Force freely for theirinaction; The Gestapo, moreover, which hitherto have been opposed to counter-activities, are now reconsidering their attitude. The leaflets dropped by theR.A.F. are, the report goes on, a serious problem. &quot; It is against human nature and especially against German nature not to read a printed piece of paper. you can convict a man if he deliberately listens to foreign broadcasts, you cannot send a man to a concentration camp if he tells you with righteous indignation : &apos; Tfelt it my duty to remove this rubbish; I do not want my children to be poisoned.&apos;This is the excuse which, with variations, has been given on many occasions whencivilians were accused of having picked up these leaflets. After several years&apos;experience of Gestapo rule there is hardly a German stupid enough to take leafletshome and keep them.  They are read and promptly destroyed.&quot;
Another problem, the report states, is that of collection and swift destruction.Large numbers of people, in addition to the police and S.A. are employed,and by no means all of them hold their tongues. Moreover, the German authoritiesparticularly dislike nights over Berlin, for the Berliner, who has a strong andsomewhat sardonic sense of humour, also respects courage, and has been exhibitingan amused admiration of the British Air Force. This is wholly incompatible with the contemptuous hatred German internal propaganda seeks to inculcate.It is significant that there has been of late a concerted effort on the part of theGerman Press to spread the illusion that all our leaflets are distributed byballoon.Moral Effect.It is, indeed, in their employment as the visiting cards of the RAF. thatone of the values of leaflets lies. A Reuter message which appeared in the Pressa few days ago contained an account of a distribution of an Austrian editionof our miniature newspaper over a small village near Braunau. Hitler&apos;s birth-place. At first the inhabitants hesitated to believe that they could be English:then, despite the ban, everybody picked them up and read them. Some were impressed and believed the contents, others dismissed them as mere propaganda.No measures to collect them were taken for some time, but at last the local school-children were turned out to gather them up. In cases of this kind the moral effect upon the German people cannot fail to be considerable. No other method,except unrestricted bombing, could more directly convey to them the far-reaching-strength of the British air-arm, or the peril which hangs over the inhabitants of the greater part of Germany. Even if the message borne were no more than an announcement that British aeroplanes had been overhead the leaflets would achieve valuable results. Incidentally, it is interesting to speculate as to theeffect on British opinion if the German Air Force were night after night to penetrate unhindered into our country and leave millions of leaflets behind.Further Reports.There are many other reports of an encouraging nature. One which comes from a secret source states that a member of the German Air Force had himselfseen the leaflets in lubeck  and that, in spite of police instructions, no one gave them up to the authorities.Again, an apparently well documented memorandum received from one ofHis Majesty&apos;s Vice-Consuls on the reception of leaflets in Vienna tells that their effect was considerable. Vigorous precautions were taken against picking them up, but people went to considerable lengths to read them. It was added, asan example, that callers in twos and threes visited one greengrocers shop wherea leaflet was known to be preserved. Other intelligence from our own sources and from the Austrian organisations in Paris have confirmed the effect of leafletsin Austria.A report from His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Antwerp dated t!he29th March is as follows : &quot; The entire population learns that air raids by British planes havebeen carried out over practically all parts of Germany, including austria and Poland. During the various raids by British planes over Western,North-Western and Northern Germany, millions of pamphlets were dropped and were veiy carefully collected, not only by Hitler Jugend or party organisations, but also by civilians who, as a matter of fact, have proved to be very eager to spread the contents of such pamphlets amongst their friends. The pamphlets go from hand to hand and, only in very few cases,people, instead of showing them to others, hand them over to the police or Party organisations.&quot;Other secret reports have also referred incidentally to the effect of leafletsin Germany.   Nearly all agree in describing the flights as important.The well-informed Social Democrat &apos;&apos; Green Reports&quot; from Germany havealso stated that the effect of the leaflets in one district has been considerable.We know, of course, that earlier in the war leaflets distributed in western germany had found their wray as far east as Berlin and Vienna.[21146] B 2
Leaflets in the Protectorate.All reports (detailed reports of distribution have now been received fromCzech sources) agree that the effect of the flights and of the leaflets was powerful.The news of the flights has been passed from mouth to mouth, and nearly thewhole population knows about them. People receive great encouragement fromthis knowledge. One report states that the &apos;&apos; effect is almost dangerouslyexhilarating.&quot; When leaflets are. jiicked up their contents are quickly made known by a whisjDering campaign over the wdiole country. Two members of theMaffia who have recently escaped from the Protectorate have reported that the text of the leaflets was suitable and that the flights have made a tremendousimpression on the population.Leaflets in Poland.The information we have expected from Poland in regard to results of thetwo flights to that country has not yet reached us. A letter, however, from a polish soldier interned at Vaxholm, which was stopped recently by the censor-ship, contained the following information : The spirits of the people are raised because they saw birds in the air,from which feathers with Polish writing fell, which deeply impressed ourPolish population and cheered them up, because they have no other news,since the wireless sets have been confiscated.&quot;&apos;Devising the Policy of Leaflets.It is, of course, difficult to obtain except from reports, of which the above aretypical, any precise information of the effect of a particular leaflet upon Germansof different regions, mentalities and classes. There is, too, naturally enough,conflict of evidence since the people of Germany tend, as do those of othercountries, to differ in their individual views. Owing, moreover, to the penaltiesimposed, our products are not freely discussed, and secret agents seem to findgreat difficult)- in obtaining reactions. I have, therefore, in devising the contents of leaflets, to trust chiefly to the local knowledge of my experts, their close study of the German Press and wireless, and their ingenuity in selecting and employingthe points most likely to strike home. In view of the fact that they are, probably,the most competent and are certainly the most experienced men to be found fortheir task, and in addition are advised by the best expert intelligence of theForeign Office, it is difficult to see how a more effective method of influencing theGerman people could be found. There is certainly no reason, even after careful investigation, to believe that any of the German refugees in this country would do better. Their knowledge is, of course, available; but propaganda is an art,and requires a special training and skill, together with an understanding ofGerman ps3*chology, rare indeed even among Germans themselves. Moreover, fewGermans, if any, could present the British point of view, an essential of my work.Forms of Leaflet.There has been constant development in the forms of our propaganda.In our large type one-sheet leaflets we have always aimed at conveying simplemessages, but now we are also employing pictures freely, in order to catch theeye of the passer-by. In our miniature newspaper and its supplements, on theother hand, we give the latest possible news, and develop arguments more freely.We believe that, though the smaller print we employ in it would not be easilyread even by a stooping person, this production (which the Germans have imitatedclosely) enjoys a considerable hand-to-hand circulation. We are also conscious of the souvenir value of productions of a more elaborate type, and intend further to develop them. In addition, we are engaged upon the production of an imitationof the Volkischer Beobachter, the German newspaper of largest circulation, whichwill be sufficiently close to deceive at first sight. Moreover, with the increasedmeans of distribution the Air Ministry has made available, we have been ablelargely to develop the production of regional leaflets. For these we can select thepoints best adapted for particular localities and address ourselves with all thegreater force to those who, we know, will read them.There is another aspect of leaflet propaganda Avhich is worth mentioning.The leaflet conveys not only news and argument, but also something of thespirit or mood of the country from Avhich it comes. Thus, when Germany Avaselated at the collapse of Finnish resistance, and her propagandists were loudly
boasting of the diplomatic defeat suffered by the Allies, we replied by propaganda leaflets of a specially cheerful and courageous tone.Risk of Curtailing Effort.In the foregoing pages I have endeavoured to prove that, despite the immensedifficulties with which we have to contend, our leaflet propaganda is steadilyexerting an influence, which, if it continues on the present scale, is bound tobe cumulative. The facts that early this year heavily increased penalties were imposed on those who read or talked about our products, and that the Nazileaders continue in almost every speech to denounce them, are we believe incon-trovertible evidences of success. So are the swift responses of German propaganda to statements made in them. Leaflet distribution by air has indeed become, asboth Spain and Finland helped to prove, a normal method of modern warfare.In connexion especially with military operations it has,a great and valuable part to play, as will, I have no doubt, appear if and when the appropriate circum-stances arise. We have now for seven months been committed to a big propaganda campaign in German)-. If we were at this stage for any reason to abandon orcurtail it, it would inevitably be attributed to weakness, and we should courtdiscredit. So much so that, even if air warfare intensified, I should plead forthe reservation of a sufficient force of bombers to enable our present power ofconveying news and of fomenting and fostering discontent in Germany and her subjugated territories to be maintained. If, for example, a heavy engagement,of the German forces on the West encouraged restiveness in Czecho-Slovakia, inxAustria or in Poland, it might be of high importance to convey messages of goodcheer or suggestions to their insubordinate or resistant peoples.Restricting the Press.In conclusion, I would allude to one of the minor, though somewhat difficult,problems which has confronted me. In the early days of the war the ChiefCensor, after careful consideration and discussion with me, issued a notice tothe Press asking it to refrain from publication of the texts of leaflets or fromcomments upon them. There were many reasons. The chief was that publication would have invited discussion and perhaps criticism both in this country and in others which could, and almost certainly would, have been used by Germaninternal propaganda to the disparagement of our efforts and the disadvantage of Great Britain. The Government might, moreover, have had to suffer muchof this criticism in silence, since it would have been virtually impossible to statepublicly the reasons for the adoption of certain lines of propaganda withoutbetraying secret sources of information, or the deeper aims of national policy orstrategy. Indeed, a domestic wrangle over our propaganda to the enemy wouldhave been both humiliating and unseemly, and would have tended to provokethe gleeful ridicule of the German Ministry of Propaganda. Time and experience has affected none of these considerations nor has any wise alternative appeared.There is even objection to the publication of those leaflets which are in themselvesquite unexceptionable, since the enemy would only too soon detect the principlesupon which we published or withheld our productions.Furthermore, Pront-Line propaganda may, before long, bulk largely in our work, and it is a matter for grave consideration whether an activity so closelyallied to military operations should be advertised in the Press. As an instance,it might be desirable to couch leaflets intended solely for the enemy soldiery interms quite foreign to the minds and experience of the British public as a whole.There would, indeed, if the texts of our leaflets were made public property, bea risk of our subjecting ourselves to limitations and influences from which thepropagandists of the enemy are entirely free. It is even possible to imagine that,if Press and public interest in our products continued, the Government mightbe seriously embarrassed by pressure on the part of newspapers and public mento adopt ill-advised suggestions and even conflicting lines of propaganda.Fortunately, although there have been some indiscretions, the more respon-sible journals of Great Britain have, hitherto, accepted the restrictions imposed in good spirit, a fact which is due to two invaluable letters addressed by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs to British editors. In this matter I would add that my conversations with my colleagues in France have led me to believethat their views on restriction of the publication of leaflets accord with those ofthe British Government.
