(this document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;sgovernment ).secret.P.(R)(40) 80.war cabinetINDIATWELFTH FORTNIGHTLY report submitted by the Secretary of 1State for India covering the period 16th-29th February 194;Previous Report: W.P.(R)(40)62)I. GENERALThe Working Committee of Congress has prepared aResolution for submission to the main Congress Session tobe held in the Middle of March.    It reiterates uncomprom-isingly the demand for Independence.By the casting vote of the Speaker of the SindAssembly a motion of no-confidence in the Ministry of that province was defeated.   Whether or not the Ministry willin consequence resign, and if so whether the presentAssembly can produce a successor, is at the moment stillunsettled; and the Governor is considering, in consultationwith the Governor-General, whether, in the event of resignation and the probability of any appreciable delay in securing a successor, he should himself assume powerstemporarily by Proclamation under Section 93 in order tosecure Supply for the beginning of the new financial year.These events in Sind have no connection with the resignation of the Congress Ministries elsewhere*-   The present Ministry,which consists of two Muslims (one of whom is chief minister) and one Hindu,- assumed office about two years ago and for most of the intervening period it has been in anCopy No.

- 2 -unstable condition owing to the fact that there are noproperly organised political parties in Sind, but (at all events so far as the Legislature is concerned) a merecongeries of groups - Congress Hindus,Independent Hindus,and several groups of Muslims which refuse to coalesce.II. MILITARY affairs there is no change in the situation as regards theArmy or the Air Forces in India.III. FOREIGN AND FRONTIER RELATIONSAfghanistan.There is reported to be a certain increase in pro-Amanullah propaganda which is gaining some support amonghigh officials, particularly in the War Ministry.North-West Frontier.Minor incidents only have occurred in Waziristan proper.Most of the bad characters appear to have collected in theAhmadzai salient to await the advance of the troops.   Thefrontier elsewhere remains quiet.&apos;  The operations in theAhmadzai salient began on the 21st February when columnsadvanced into the salient meeting with some opposition.The hostiles are estimated to have lost 19 killed and 25wounded in the first two days.   On the night of the 24th/251hFebruary two platoons of Frontier Constabulary on patrolduty in the Bannu District were ambushed by a large gang ofabout 500 hostiles.   Their casualties were 15 killed, 14wounded and 3 missing, and the arms of all casualties were lost.   28 men succeeded in returning to their post with their arms.Sinkiang.The Chinese Administrative Commissioner at Kashgarpromised&apos; to make a further reference to the Provincial

Government at Urumchi on the question of the Consul-General&apos;s wireless but the latter received the impression that it is the intention to insist on the station beingclosed by the 1st May.   The matter has been taken up againwith His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Chungking.The Consul-General reports that there have been notroop movements of any importance in southern Sinkiangduring the past two months.IV.  INDIAN STATESNil.V. ECONOMICEconomic Warfare.It may be of interest to record something of the part which India is playing in the prosecution of economic war-fare,   In this sphere the Government of India have co-operated most willingly in all suggestions which have beenmade to them and their assistance has been most useful.At the beginning of the war the Government of Indiaestablished a system of export control analagous to thatoperating in the United Kingdom.   Exports licensed to neutral countries in Europe have been restricted to normal trade and the list of commodities to which the systemapplied has been extended to cover all India&apos;s importantexports.    In addition to its primary function of preventingcommodities of value for war from reaching the enemy, thisexport control provides a valuable bargaining weaponbecause of the extent to which the available world suppliesof certain important commodities are obtainable only inIndia.   For example, India is the only important producer of jute and under existing conditions European neutrals can obtain their supplies of groundnuts only from India.   Thus,

9 9 3!merely by the exercise of control over exports it ispossible to bring pressure to bear upon foreign governments.For example, not only did India, in combination with therest of the Empire, maintain a ban on all exports to roumania between 24th January and 21st February inconnection with negotiations with the Roumanian government regarding petroleum, but, in order to help the negotiationsfor war trade agreements which are at present being carriedon with the Danish and Netherlands Governments, exports from India to those countries of oil seeds and oilcake havebeen restricted to small figures since early in December.By withholding licences for the export of jute to Italy it proved possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government at the end ofDecember to reach an agreement whereby a quantity of italian hemp which was much needed in this country waspurchased in return for a promise of export licences for a fixed quantity of Indian jute.   Negotiations are at presentproceeding for the supply of Italian hides required for themanufacture of army boots in return for the sale to italy of Indian hides for which there is a demand in Italy but which, on account of lighter quality, are of no military value, the same tactics of withholding export licences for indian hides being employed.   Similarly, licences for theexport of jute to Hungary are at present being withheld inorder to facilitate negotiations for the purchase by theMinistry of Supply of Hungarian hemp.The possibility of goods being forwarded to Germany via the Trans-Siberian Railway through the agency of JapaneseCompanies is a difficult problem for the Government ofIndia in view of the vital importance to India of herexport trade to Japan.   The Government of India have beenasked for their views on a suggestion that Indian exports ofraw cotton to Japan, which are normally very substantial,

should be rationed on a monthly basis.   At the beginning of-&quot;February export licences were refused for a large quantityof jute bags consigned to Japanese Companies in Manchuriawhich are known to have been intended for the carriage ofsoya beans via the Trans-Siberian Railway to Germany.Early in February a quantity of paper believed to beof enemy origin which was to have been transhipped atCalcutta for onward despatch to Shanghai and otherdestinations was detained by the Indian authorities underthe Reprisals Order-in-Council.   This is the first casearising in India under that Order.   Part of the paper sodetained has been placed in prize and other parts are underc onsideration for similar treatment.   Other substantial quantities of paper consigned to India, which arrived atBombay on other ships, and which are also suspected of being of enemy origin have been detained for consideration.VI.    FINANCEIndian Budget.The Central Government&apos;s Budget was introduced in theLegislature on February 29th.   The following tabledsummarises the figures (converted into sterling) of thelatest revised estimate for the current year and of theBudget estimate (on the basis of existing taxation) for1940-41.Revenue 1939-40 1940-41(Revised Estimate) (Budget Estimate)  millions   millionsCustoms and Excise 37.55 34.50Income Tax (Centre&apos;s share) and CorporationTax 11.30 12.12Other sources 16.97 .17.45Revenue Reserve Fund - . 6865.82 64.75$ (For footnotes please see following page)

Richmond Terrace, S.W.- 14th March 1940.Debt RepatriationA scheme has been announced under which holders ofGovernment of India sterling securities will be able to convert their holdings into rupee securities bearing thesame rate of interest and having the same maturity.   Thisfacility may attract Indian holders of sterling securities of whom there is a large number, who are desirous inpresent circumstances of remitting their investments backto India.    Its main purpose, however, is to permitoperations on Government account whereby the large surplussterling balances which are accruing, under the stimulusof war, from India&apos;s exports, may be usefully employed inthe purchase and cancellation of sterling securities,while the complementary rupee finance is automaticallyraised by the marketing of corresponding securities inIndia.Z.
