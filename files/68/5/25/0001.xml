Twenty-fifth Weekly Report on the Oil Position..Sj  J 2* Stocks of petroleum for the Services shew no appreciable change from those reported in last week&apos; return, but it is interesting to note that the stock of aviation spirit for the Air Ministry continues to  increasesteadily.On the civil side the stock of motor1 spirit showed anincrease.      Stocks of kerosene and heavy oils againdecreased but the foward positions show some improvement,though especially as regards fuel oils much still remains to be done before a really satisfactory position is re-established.      The demand for kerosene remained at ahigh level probably due to desire of the distributors toreplenish stocks.TANKERS. The number of tankers which arrived in this country during the week was twenty-three of which three were engaged on Admiralty Service.    In addition to these onetanlcer arrived at Havre with War Office supplies for theB.E.F.Particulars in respect of the past five weeks,together with the weekly average for the three pre-warmonths and for the past five months are set out inTable II.IMPORTS.
