in cases where it was felt that the neutral purchaserwould suffer hardship by the strict observance of the rule,it might be relaxed.3)    The Committee was of opinion that refugees fromGermany applying for exemption should be informed that toavoid inconvenience and aelay they should obtain exemption for smaller articles of luggage carried with them as wellas for larger pieces of luggage and lift-vans.32.       On the general question of luggage the propertyof passengers other than refugees, the Committee approved the suggestion that, as far as possible, luggage shouldbe occasionally examined to discover whether any merchandisev/as contained in it and in order that passengers might knowthey ran the risk of detection if they tried to carrymerchandise.     The Committee wished to make it clear that theexistence of the certificate of origin would not, of itself,preclude the possibility of examination.
