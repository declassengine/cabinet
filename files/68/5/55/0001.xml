(40) 105.March 29, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecv of this document,WAR CABINET.PUBLICITY IX ENEMY COUNTRIES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues, for their information, a Report by3ir Campbell Stuart on the activities of the Department of Publicity in enemy countries for the period from the 7th Eebruarv to the 22nd March. 1940.H.Foreign Office, March 29. 1940.PUBLICITY IN ENEMY COUNTRIES.LenffeU.IN my last report, dated the 6m February. I deplored the Interference offrost and snow with the dissemination of leaflets over Germany. In a periodof six weeks only 7.000,000 had been distributed. Since then, however, improve-ment in the weather and an increase in the number of aircraft- employed in.our work have combined to secure a much greater output. In the period I nowreview thirty-five individual leaflets to a total of over 24,0*30,000 copies havebeen distributed. Of these 1,234,000 copies have been carried by balloon. Anumber of the flights have been of exceptional range and daring. Two visitshave been paid to Poland, the second reaching Warsaw; three to Prague, two to Yienna, one to Linz, and no less than six to Berlin and its district.It has now become possible for us to count, subject to military necessities,on both larger and more regular distributions.! Consequently, we are enabled,on the one hand, to print fresher news, and, on the other, toprepare regional propaganda aimed at. partielar districts of Germany,and even at particular cities. This tends to sharpen the point of ourproductions. Indeed, we can now feel that the cumulative effect at whichwe have long aimed is in process of achievement. This is especially true ofthe Hamburg-Bremen area- These cities have been visited frequently, first,because we believe -them to be a specially favourable soil, and, secondly, theyare the best of all objectives for the training purposes of the EA.F. I need,scarcely explain that the selection of targets is a matter we discuss closely withthe R.A.E. Unfortunately, with the approach of shorter nights, the range of aircraft is likely to be progressively restricted and the more distant targetsvisited of late to be inaccessible.The leaflets scattered over Germany in the past six weeks were widely variedin form and substance. For example, one, a folder illustrated with&quot; photo-montage, conveyed a joint message from the Prise Ministers of Great Britain10956   [21055]
and France; six were consecutive issues of the little paper Wolkiger Beobachter;one was based upon quotations from the Prime Ministers Birmingham Speech;another on quotations from Lord Halifax and Mr. Churchill; others again wereaddressed to German women and to ex-Trade Unionists. Anticipation of increased activity in the air has, moreover, led to the preparation of a long seriesof leaflets with special applications to the Hamburg area, Kiel, the Upper Rhineand the Ruhr. It includes some single-page news sheets under titles embodyingnames of places to be visited.In our newer productions we are making greater use of illustrations,employing our own cartoonists for the purpose. We believe that a good photo-graph&quot;, cartoon or drawing, which conveys its message clearly, is a valuableaddition to our short single-sheet leaflets. &quot;Even Germans cannot resist a picture.Broadcasting.On the 3rd March the B.B.C. inaugurated the first of the three broadcasts bywhich it has intended for many weeks to supplement its daily programme inGerman. The period chosen for it is from 11-15 p.m. to 11-30 p.m. There is reason to believe that, although the hour be late, children and servants will by then be well out of the way, and the risk of listening will be somewhat less thanin the case of the earlier broadcasts. It has, indeed, been suggested to us from french sources that audiences could be found even later in the night.At the end of February Professor Lindley Fraser, to whose selection my lastreport referred, began his &quot;regular tri-weekly talks on the German programme.He is, according to the experts at Portland&quot; Place, shaping well for the role of regular commentator in German. Every Saturday he visits my country head-quarters in order to discuss his scheme for the following week, and each of hisbroadcasts is subsequently prepared in consultation with my staff. Personalityin a broadcaster is the result of careful training by the experienced rather than of individual inspiration, and there is reason to hope that Professor Fraser&apos;stalks will in time become a most valuable feature in our wireless propaganda.It is also worth mentioning that, at the end of February, the B.B.C. arranged for weekly talks in Czech by Jan Masaryk, in the programme addressed to his fellow-countrymen. These have, we believe, proved an effective addition. Indeed,the large numbers of listeners in the Protectorate have encouraged us to pay the closest attention to the broadcasts addressed to it, and warranted the specialmessage from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs broadcast on the14th March, the eve of the anniversary of the German entry into Prague.We have recently been engaged in reviewing with the B.B.C. both the policyand technique of the broadcasts to Germany and the other countries within oursphere of action. As a result we have prepared a series of directives, in whichwe describe as closely as possible the internal conditions in each of them, and lay down the principles to be observed in wireless propaganda. We have also recom-mended certain minor changes in the presentation of talks and news, which will,we hope, enhance the effects produced.Results Achieved.There is a volume of reports to the effect that our leaflets have been received,circulated and widely read in Germany. In regard, however, to the general impression created, it is usually impossible to obtain more exact evidence thanthe opinion of individual recipients in Germany at the best an uncertain guide.In the case of the recent raids upon Austria the reports have been somewhat moreilluminating. One, from a British Vice-Consul in Roumania, stated that the leaflets dropped in Vienna produced considerable effect. People went, despitevigorous precautions, to considerable lengths to read them, and, it added, as an example, that callers in twros and threes visited one greengrocers shop where aleaflet was known to have been preserved. Other reports have confirmed the viewthat, in this case certainly, our productions achieved excellent results. Moreover,Herr Burckel, the Gauleiter of Vienna, made a vicious onslaught upon theirtexts, a clear indication that they had been widely read and required refutation.This is, indeed, a common sequence to raids by the Royal Air Force since,beginning with Goring on the 9th September last, every Speech of a Germanleader (except that of Hitler at the Berlin War Memorial) has contained anattack either on the leaflets or on the policy of bombless flights over Germany.From Czecho-Slovakia, too, the reports upon the results of the special flights
there have been most encouraging. A great impression was created, and the intelligence which has reached us up to date indicates that the leaflets themselveswere well received.In regard to the reception of our broadcasts, messages received from secret and other sources suggest that the recent increase in the penalties for listeninghave not succeeded in restricting it. One, from the British Consulate at Liege,states that the German-language population of the German cantons, which other-wise listens only to Cologne, listens also to them, and that they are stated tobe highly satisfactory. Clandestine listening is, the report goes on, believed to be on the increase in Germany. One method now employed is to make upa party of four people, of whom two keep watch at the door and window, whilethe others listen in a darkened room to the receiving set, which has been heavilymuffled in rugs and bedclothes. A secret report of early March confirms that,despite the threat and the imposition of heavy penalties, large numbers of thepopulation continue to listen to the &quot; forbidden &quot; foreign broadcasts. Germanlisteners, it says, refer to items of information in a very guarded way. Theusual formula is : &quot;I had a very strange dream last night I dreamt. ...&quot; Thefriend replies: &quot; That&apos;s strange, I had the same dream: what a coincidence.&quot;The B.B.C. have also received plentiful evidence which satisfies them that manyGermans continue, in spite of the severe restrictions, to hear and to discussforeign broadcasts.The Soviet Union.I have for some time been making the necessary preparations for the task of introducing propaganda into Russia which the Government has committed tome. I have selected and appointed a small nucleus staff of experts which isalready engaged in collecting the information required, and surveying theproblems entailed. Progress in this matter must, owing to its peculiar difficulties and the fact that we are not at war with Russia, be slow; but I am satisfied thatthere will be no unnecessary delay in accomplishment of all that can be done.Relations with France.I have recently been to France. The chief object of my visit was to promote,in order to facilitate my co-operation with them, a closer co-ordination of thevarious bodies in that country which are concerned with propaganda directed atthe enemy. I found that I obtained a ready hearing from those Ministers and officials to whom I spoke, and particularly from M. Reynaud, General Gamelinand M. Mandel. In view, however, of the fact that the appointment of a Ministerof Information was generally anticipated, I decided to await that event, and then to raise the matter afresh. The recent change of Government and the appoint-ment of M. Frossard have now created a situation which may perhaps enable meshortly to visit Paris and renew my endeavours.Neutral Countries.We have recently taken steps to improve our arrangements for securinginformation through neutral countries of internal conditions in Germany. Amember of my staff has visited Denmark, Sweden and Norway and inaugurateda more regular service of intelligence, which should be a valuable supplement tothe reports we have been receiving from our agents in Switzerland and Belgium.On his return, he reported favourably on the reception of our newsletter, theLondoner Brief. The circulation of this publication is now about 8,000, and weare pursuing a policy of concentrating it in States bordering upon the Reich,with the belief that a considerable number of copies infiltrate into enemy territory.We have learned, for instance, that it reaches Vienna in some numbers. We havealso heard from Latvia that an issue which treated of Finland made a deepimpression in Riga. We have, moreover, made preparations which are now inan advanced stage, to produce another newsletter in German, which will be printed in the neutral countries bordering on Germany, and posted into it.Co-operation with the Services.The Consultative Committee on which the Secretariat of the War Cabinet,the Intelligence Departments of the Services, the Foreign Office, the Ministryof Economic Warfare and the Ministry of Information are represented, has, in
the period under review, met three times. The Head of the Secret Service isalso a member. It continues to provide a valuable clearing-house for suggestions in regard to propaganda activities. An important part of its business isdiscussion of ruses de guerre; and a number of &quot; whispers,&quot; which have doubtlessechoed in Germany, have originated at its meetings. Its chief object is, of course,the correlation of the policy and work of my department with strategy; and inthis respect the Committee&quot;has proved, in so far as circumstances have allowed,of substantial value.Relations with the Opposition, the Liberal Party, and the Press.I continue to maintain close personal touch with the Labour and LiberalParties through Mr. Lees Smith and Lord Samuel, the representatives respectivelyaccredited by them for contact with me. Hitherto I have encountered on their part, and that of other non-Governmental leaders with whom I have discussed the work of my department, only the most helpful spirit, and no differences ofopinion have arisen. I also frequently see private Members of Parliament whohave exhibited a particular interest in the activities of my department. On the18th March I held a meeting of my private Committee of Newspaper Proprietors,and found that they also had no criticisms to offer. All who attended it were satisfied with the propaganda now emanating from my office, and even preparedwillingly to accept the restrictions upon the publication of the texts of ourleaflets which the Censor has imposed. In view of the &quot;news value&quot; of manyrecent leaflet raids on enemy territory, their attitude in this matter is, I submit,both patriotic and disinterested.Relations with the Roman Catholic Church.Indirectly we are in contact with his Excellency Cardinal Hinsley, and havebeen assured of his unqualified desire to help us in every way within his power.Throughout the extensive mission field of the Roman Catholic Church we haveindirectly established contact by letters. Such letters, it is clearly understood,will never contain any political propaganda; but they will insist quietly andconvincingly on just those ideals for which the Allies are fighting, and which, onceaccepted, will necessarily lead the leaders to be sternly critical of Nazi tyranny.Conclusion.Finally, I am happy to report that the progress made by my department inevery other branch of its activities has been continuous, and, to me at any rate,satisfactory. I have recently strengthened my staff by the appointment ofMr. F. A. Voigt, the distinguished Foreign Editor of the Manchester Guardian,as head of my Intelligence Section, and am finding him most useful in that capacity. As month follows month, my German department has been gainingexperience in its work, and I have every reason to believe that the propagandait prepares serves its purpose as fully as the information at our disposal permits.My relations with the other departments with which I am concerned growcloser. This is particularly true of the Ministry of Information, with which my liaison has been strengthened, and of the Ministry of Economic Warfare,where I have posted a liaison officer.CAMPBELL STUART.March 22, 1940.
