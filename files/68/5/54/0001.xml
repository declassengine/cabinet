Twenty-Finth Yfeekly Report on tire Oil Position,IKS. There is again very little change in the stocks ofpetroleum for the Services.On the civil side there was en increase in the total stocksof e.ll products compare! with last week of over 20,000 tons.-73113^ The number of tankers vhich arrived in this country duringthe week was twenty-eight., of which two ware engaged on admiralty Service.    The total for imports other than on admiralty account was the highest since the outbreak of war. .Pour out of the last five weeks  showed good returns: but the stocksof heavy oils continue to call for improvement.Particulars in respect of the past five weeks, togetherwith the weekly -average for the three pre-war months and for  thepast six months,  are set out in Table II.IrQRTS... The total quantity ox all products imported during theweek (Table III) was 269,000 tons.The forward programme for the four weeks ending20th April (Table &quot;7)  is slightly lower than for last week.-FSUlvIP- Total deliveries for consumption were the  seine as in theprevious week.    Increases in respect of motor Spirit and heavy Oils were offset by decreases in the case of all other products.     (Table YI. )    The increase in the consumption of motor Spirit is presumably due to the improvement in weather conditions and to the greater utilisation of the permissibleration in anticipation of the Easter holiday.The following tables are appended :--Table      1.
