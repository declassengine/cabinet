INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.1,     Measured in terms of trade disputes and stoppages of work, industrial relations are satisfactory &quot;but it may be useful to refer to certain factorscausing restlessness - it can hardly be described as unrest - among the rank and file who have not yet grasped the full extent of the nation&apos;s war effort or all that it involves.2.     To some extent the wage position has been eased by the faot that thecost of living figure for January showed only the smallest increase, butit is openly declared that this figure is not a fair reflection of theactual increase in living costs that has to be borne by the workers andoritioism of the basis upon which it is compiled is inclined to gatherstrength.3.     There are also several large and important groups of workpeople that had not by the end of January received any increase of wages to meetincreased living expenses since war began, including those in theEngineering, Shipbuilding and iron and steel industries, Railway workers,including shopmen and road haulage workers.     (Such increases have since&quot;been given to engineering, road haulage and railway workers).4-.     The attitude of the rank and file towards the dangers of a viciousspiral of wages and prices has been stated by an officer of the Departmentwho is in olose touch with the problem in the following words:-&quot;The &quot;vicious spiral1 controversy is going fairly strong at themoment, partly because it is the kind of controversy which provides a text for, and can be exploited by, all sorts of groups and individualswith diverse aims, many of whom find in it their first opportunitysince the war of lining up with the trade union and labour movements in a 1 united front.     The average trade unionist&apos;s position is simpleenough when he gives expression at all; he is not excited about thematter and is open to argument; he claims that cost of living and theprofits of trading and manufacturing should be kept down; how theyshould be kept down is the Governments problem.     He does not pretendto understand the difficulties of control or the complications of subsidy and the provision of the means of subsidy; he does notdifferentiate the elements in the industrial situation - the difficultiesof an export trade, the incidence of hardship as between the highly paid and the lowly paid workers, the increments of overtime andpiece-work payments, etc., etc, - but says that if cost of livinggoes up then wages should also go up.     The local trade union officialsargue in much the same way and even when they are under instructions from headquarters to reject a &quot;fodder basis1 they cannot get away from it in their discussions with employers or members.     It is doubtful ifthe speeohes of Ministers, or the quotations from such speeches by employers whose use of them is prejudicial anyway, or the leadingarticles in newspapers the trades unionist does not read, will disturb

the simplification which will persist until the trade union leaders to whom he looks for guidance can&apos; reach reasonable agreement upon a wage policy.     ivleantime, the propagandist, the political lecturer,organiser or theorist, makes the most of the opportunity, not, as yet,with great success, to develop the thesis &quot;that the Government wantsthe working man to &quot;bear the cost of the war&quot;.5.     Other factors leading to restlessness among the workpeople are the black-out, recent bad weather conditions and, in certain trades, fatiguedue to long hours and the pressure under whioh work is being performed.Some of these will right themselves in the ordinary course while others are receiving attention.     Another difficulty, which may be increasinglyfelt as time goes on unless the position is properly controlled, will arise from the overcrowding of particular munition areas, resulting in a shortageof accommodation and transport and of facilities for recreation and other social amenities.6.     There is also a certain amount of resistance to demands for changesin normal working practices, to the further employment of women and torelaxation of the provisions of the Factory Acts.     This is associatedwith the fact that the unemployment figures still show Ig- million personsunemployed, of whom it has to be admitted that between 600,000 and 700,000are available for new work if they can be fitted in.7.     The leaders of the workpeople have a real appreciation of the many difficulties that are not at present in the minds of the rank and file,but they are in no doubt that, if they are to maintain their authority theymust be able to carry their people with them and that they cannot ignore the psychological factor.     The process of education in the problems of wareconomy can only proceed gradually and must be accompanied by a sense of real equality of sacrifice.     There must be no Justification for doubtswhether reference to the dangers of a wages-costs spiral ignores thepossibility of a prices-profits spiral.8.     So long as the Trade Union leaders r etain the confidence of their members, the influence of extremists and left wing elements is negligible,but the latter are ever ready to take full advantage of any real grievancesthat may develop.

9.     On the employers&apos; side, certain sections would undoubtedly welcome a lead from the Government on the problem of the adjustment of wages under war conditions.     They find great difficulty in reconciling the needs of national economy with claims for increases of wages on grounds that are difficult to deny, such as the increased cost of living and improved earning capacity, thelatter more especially in industries such as the cotton textile industry wherepeace time wages have been depressed owing to bad trade.     Otherwise the main difficulty on the employers&apos; side lies in dealing with the small minoritywhose workpeople have only recently been organised and who wish to avoid, asin the past, trade union negotiations.10.   The National Joint Advisory Council held its fourth meeting on 51st January.Since the previous meeting the two representative sides had met jointly andit was reported that they had made some progress in the preparation of astatement embodying agreed views on a number of the matters raised in thestatement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the recent meeting ofthe Council, such as the desirability of the policies of controlling prices and of encouraging voluntary savings.     The Trade Union side, however, werenot prepared to commit themselves to a statement on these matters   until theyhad received a reply to their request that workpeople&apos;s war savings should be disregarded in the application of means tests to which they might in futurebecome subject.     The discussions between the two sides will be resumed onl;13th February by which date it was promised that a statement on behalf of theGovernment would be available.     The discussion in full Council will be resumed on 6th March.11.   A useful exchange of views and information took place between thei representative members of the Council and officers of the Board of Trade and that Ministry of Pood on the control of food prices and the working of thePrices of Goods Act.     Other matters discussed included (a) methods of meeting^transport and accommodation difficulties during the holiday season, (b) theprevention of undue congestion of munition centres and (c) Government policypi regard to the labour supply for munitions.

EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT.112.   As anticipated, the result of the monthly count on 15th January shewed a; substantial increase in unemployment (157,371), almost wholly accounted for by weather conditions.     In the three industries, building, agriculture andI public works contracting, most affected by frost and snow, there were increasesI totalling over 130,000.     The usual increase resulting from the end of the  Christmas season seemed to be somewhat lower than usual.     The number of boysand girls added to the Register at the end of the school term amounted toiover 9,000.13.   There is little change to report in the employment position in theengineering industry, but discussions with the Employers&apos; and Workers&apos;Sides have now begun.     The preliminary talks with the Management Board of theEngineering Employers&apos; Federation and the Executive of the AmalgamatedfEngineering Union were conducted in a friendly- and sympathetic atmosphere.     ItIhas been arranged that the talks will be resumed after an interval of aboutllO days, when definite suggestions will, it is hoped, be forthcoming.     Afdiscussion with the Confederation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Unions has beeniarranged for 13th February.The position in certain individual industries apart from engineering isteiscussed in the following notes.Building.14.   Employment in the building industry has been greatly affected by the^abnormal weather conditions prevailing in January and in many parts of theountry outdoor work has been at a standstill.     This is shown in the increasef unemployment among skilled building workers which occurred between8th December, 1939, and 8th January, 1940.     At the latter date the numberunemployed was 55,855, representing an increase of over 17,000 over thecorresponding figure on 8th December.Goal Mining.15.   Short time working has persisted, particularly in Northumberland and DurhamBut to a lesser degree elsewhere.     This was no doubt accentuated in recent$reeks by the abnormal weather conditions and consequent transport difficulties,lut information as to its extent is not yet available.     In the earlier part ofthe month, however, the weather was already restricting work on the surface inlie Scottish Coalfields though it did not adversely affect the numbers employed4.

underground.     The effects of shipping delays were most keenly felt at Horden,Hough ton-le-Spring and Seaham Harbour, and the loss in production at Stanleyduring the month is estimated to be over 55,000 tons.     The export trade fromthe northern collieries was affected by the shipping position but in Walesemployment improved further and most collieries maintained full production.Slate Quarrying.16.   The curtailment of building and road development schemes has continued to depress employment in the industry.      It is estimated that since the outbreakof War some 1,660 slate quarrymen have been rendered wholly unemployed while2,900 are working less than their normal number of shifts.Textiles.17.   Boom conditions continue in most of the textile industries.     The demandfor skilled workers continues to outrun the supply.     Several applicationshave been made to extend the working hours of female employees and various other expedients have been adopted in an endeavour to expand production stillfurther.18.   In the woollen industry there have been occasional suspensions of work through the shortage of supply of crossbred and Merino wools.     As a result of contracts placed by the Ministry of Supply, a fair amount of employment hasbeen given on the making of camouflage nets at Hull and Lowestoft, and two groups of outworkers have been organised on the Moray Firth with other in contemplation.Clothing;.19.   The effect of Government contracts has been marked in decreasing thecustomary decline in employment at this time of the year and in the North Eastarea particularly the industry is very active.     Unemployment is mainlyconcentrated in the branches which do not receive Government contracts in bulk,i.e. the bespoke tailoring trade, the for trade and the better class dressmakingand millinery.     The shortage of skilled machinists persists and efforts to train inexperienced adult workers encounter difficulties because of the initiallow earnings on piece rates.     In the boot and shoe trade, however, it isreported that the training   of elderly and inexperienced men to replace workers who have been called up is increasing in the North Midlands.Fishing.20.   Activity in the fishing industry has been affected by the further depletionof the trawler fleets, hy enemy action in the North Sea and by bad weather.5.

In Hull and Grimsby, however, there has been a decrease in unemployment due partly to the further absorption of men into mine sweeping and patrol service.In this connection it is interesting to note that efforts made to recruitfishermen for the Mercantile Marine are said to be largely unsuccessfulbecause the men prefer to enter the patrol service.     Another contributingcause is the good price obtained for fish which is making fishing a good deal more lucrative than at other times.Pert Transport.21. Despite the weather employment at most ports was not adversely affected.The exceptions were Bristol and Hull; work at the timber yards in the latterport having been impeded by the heavy snow. Unemployment in London remainedbelow the 5,000 level and at Liverpool between 6,000 and 7,000. Bristol wasexceptionally quiet in the latter part of the month and had over 1,200 menregistering.     The latest figures available do not show that unemploymentd been affected by the recent interruption of transport facilities, but itis possible that later reports will reveal the effects in some ports,articularly on the west coast.istribution.22.   In all Divisions unemployment on 15th January was substantially worse,articular ly among women, than three weeks before.     More than one Division,&quot;owever, reports that activity has been maintained by a number of causes;anuary sales, extra staff required to deal with food rationing, the presencetroops or evacuees in certain areas (particularly in the Southern Division)r the absorption of some workers into the Armed Forces.     The seasonal increaseunemployment has, therefore, frequently been less severe than in normalears.     On the other hand the smaller rate of increase may perhaps beartially accounted for by the greater absolute volume of unemployment.hotels and Catering.23.   In this group there was a negligible change in unemployment in thefortnight before 15th January, but the position then was distinctly betterthan a month previously.     In the Southern Division this is ascribed largely to the billeting of troops and to provision of accommodation for naval officers,d m London partly to the absorption of employees in the Navy, Army andir Force Institutes,aper manufacture and Printing.-   The employment position in these trades is much the same as in previous^nths.^   Paper manufacture is fairly busy excepting where there is a shortageraw materials, but printing is generally slack.6.

Food.25.   There has been some decline in employment since Christmas but the main difficulty appears to be a shortage of materials, in great part because ofrestricted imports.     In Scotland, for instance, butter rationing is affectingconfectionery and high class baking, and the shortage of grain the distillingindustry.     London and Southern Divisions are busy with Government contracts and the Eastern Division reports that chocolate and jam making areexceptionally active.Entertainment and Sport.26.   The revival from the first shock of the outbreak of war still seems to be continuing slowly.     London reports that there are signs of renewed activity in the fiLn industry.     In the North Western Division a substantial number ofthe girls discharged from the football pools seem to be finding fairlypermanent employment.     In the theatrical profession, however, the Actors&apos;Organisations are concerned at the danger of some exploitation of artistes.Furniture making.27.   Southern Division reports activity on Government contracts, but elsewhere the trade seems still to be depressed by the curtailment of private demand and the shortage of timber.Shipbuilding.- 28.   Reports from all of the shipyard areas show that activity has reached anew high level, and there is a pronounced shortage of certain types of skilled workers.     In some districts the bottle-neck in the supply of shipwrights hasbeen overcome, in agreement with the Unions, by the employment of skilledjoiners, though other areas continue to complain of a serious shortage of this class of worker.     Employers are to an increasing extent co-operating among themselves to overcome local difficulties - e.g. at Southampton skilled menare being moved from job to job according to the degree of urgency of thework, and at Grimsby an understanding has been reached between the employersaimed at preventing &quot;poaching&quot;.     During the month, a serious shortage ofriveters in the South Western Division has been eased by the transfer(through the Employment Exchanges) of unemployed riveters from theNorth East coast.

29.   The labour supply position is on the whole satisfactory.     A substantial number of women is now employed in the latter, industry.     Generally speakingthe supply of female labour has been adequate, although the demands of theChorley Pilling Factory (where over 3,000 women have already been placedthrough the Exchanges) are so heavy that it has now become necessary toconsider men for some of these vacancies, the recent revival in the cottonindustry having increased the opportunities of employment for women in their normal occupations.THE CENTRAL REGISTER.30.   The appended Note shows for the period up to 31st January, 1940, thenumber of vacancies notified to the Central Register, the number of personssubmitted and the number notified as engaged.31.   Since the outbreak of war 7,026 vacancies have been notified in respectof which 7,726 persons have been submitted.     During this period 3,029persons have been notified as engaged,32.   During the fortnight under review (l6th to 31st January) orders for653 persons were received and 835 persons were submitted to Ordering Departments.The number of placings notified during the fortnight was 423 which again&quot;shows an increase on the previous fortnight (405) .3.   The number of effective cards of persons on the Central Register on31st January was 87,676 as against 86,489 on 15th January.

TRAPJING.Recruitment for Government Training Centres improved slightly duringperiod under review but further steps are being taken to stimulate it.&apos;&apos;&apos;e number of serving soldiers in training as Army tradesmen rose to 953 onhe 25th January.     Proposals for increasing the number of training places byconsiderable amount following upon the Cabinet decision of 18th January aredw in train.RECRUITING.The next registration under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act hasen fixed for Saturday, 17th February.     The men who will be required to register on that day, will be those not already registered who, onst December, 1939, had reached the age of 20, but not the &apos;age of 24.     Ineffect the registration will, therefore, relate to(l) men who since 31st December, 1938, but before 2nd December, 1939, havereached the age of 23;   and(2) men who have reached the age of 20 since 1st December, 1939, but before 1st January, 1940..ere will, therefore, be 11 months&apos; supply of men aged 23 and 1 month&apos;s supplyf men aged 20.     Widespread publicity is being given to these arrangementshrough the Press and the B.B.C., and posters will shortly be exhibited through-out the country setting out in detail the classes of men to register and theprocedure to be followed at the time of registration.     After this registrationKb will be possible to register men on a full &quot;birth year&quot; basis.7.     In order to ensure that men to be posted for service with H.M. Forces areelected on a wider basis and in closer conformity with the principle of callingp the youngest first, the work of allocation and posting which has hithertoifieen performed by a number of selected Local Offices is being centralised in theleven Divisional Offices of the Ministry.8.     The Umpire has now given a number of leading decisions on appeals arisingom applications for postponement certificates made under Section 6 of the Act.ere the application has been based on the domestic position of the man, thempire has ruled that circumstances, over and above the mere withdrawal of aontribution to the household fund, must be proved before exceptional hardshipan be established.     Where it is a question of business responsibilities and interests, the Umpire has laid down the principle that a postponement certificate10.

oannot be granted on the ground that the applicant is engaged on work ofnational importance or is more usefully employed in the national interest inbis normal employment.     In this connection it may be noted that where it is desired to defer the calling up of a key worker in the national interest, theII[necessary action can always be taken administratively.     The fact that thebusiness in respect of which the applicants responsibilitys and interestsarise cannot be carried on so expeditiously, efficiently or conveniently inhis absence, is not a ground for granting a postponement certificate.     BeforeH postponement certificate may be granted in such cases, it is necessary toshow that the business could not be carried on at all in the applicantspbsence.     In the case of students, the Umpire has ruled that a postponementcertificate may be- granted to a full time student who proves that he has been&quot;studying for a critical examination for a period of not less than a year, whenthe critical examination for which he is studying is due to be held within9 months of the date on which he registered for service in the Armed Forces.En the case of a part-time student, the same principle applys with theException that the student must show that he has been studying for a criticalexamination for a period of not less than 2 years.9.     The University Joint Recruiting Boards and their associated Technicalommittees continue to function effectively.     Since 21st October, 1939 morelhan 5,000 undergraduates, resident graduates and men under the age of 25 withcertain prescribed scientific and technical qualifications have been inter-iewed.     Approximately 3,000 of these men have been assessed as to their;uitability for training as officers and the great majority have been recommendet&quot;&apos;for such training.     The remainder, numbering approximately 2,000,have beeniterviewed by the Technical Committees for assessment of their technical qualifications.     Of these men 65 have been recommended for service in a technical capacity in the Royal Navy, 805 for service in a like capacity inthe Army and 103 for the Royal Air Force.     1,011 men have been recommended to continue their studies for varying periods so that they may be better fitted or scientific and technical work.     Where such recommendations have been madein respect of men liable to be  icalled up for service under the National Service(Armed Forces) Act, arrangements have been made not to call up the men untilihe recommended course of study has been completed.     Ill men have been 11.

recommended as possessing outstanding scientific qualifications and in such,cases the men have been reserved for scientific or technical work of a highorder either in the Armed Forces, in the Government service or in the war industries.     458 men were found not to possess sufficient technical qualifica-ticns to merit special treatment.40.     The most recent figures show that 6,076 decisions have been given by thelocal tribunals which have been set up to decide the applications of men to be registered as conscientious objectors.     Analysed by categories the decisions were as follows -Registered unconditionally as conscientious objectors.....................     837        (14$)Registered conditionally for civilian work .. . 2,740        (45$)Registered for non-combatant duties in the armed Forces     .................. 1,439        (24$)Applications dismissed ............... 1,060        (17$)Total ... 6,076The Appellate Tribunal for England and Wales has considered a total of314: appeals.     In 222 cases the appeals have been dismissed, while in 92 casesthe decision of the local tribunals has been varied.     The Scottish Divisionof the Appellate Tribunal has so far heard 63 appeals and in 18 cases thedecision of the local tribunals has been varied.     It is proposed to set upshortly a new local tribunal to cover the Southern Division of the Ministry.SCHEDULE OF RESERVED OCCUPATIONS.4-1.     The amendments to the Schedule have been few in number and of relativelyminor importance.42.    Discussions have taken pla.ee with representatives of various industries,viz., the Cinema industry, who raised the question of the reservation positionof a large number of occupations in the industry;   the Wholesale ClothingManufacturers&apos; Federation of Great Britain and the National Union of Tailorsand Garments Workers, who are interested in mechanic repairers and shirtand garment cutters;    the Paper Tube Manufacturers, who are concerned with&quot;tacklers&quot;;   the National Union of Foundry Workers in respect of &quot;coremakers&quot;;and Cables and Wireless Limited concerning probationary student cable engineers.

45.     Representations from sixty different representatives of industry,either for the inclusion of additional occupations in the Schedule, orfor the variation of the present age of reservation of certain occupations,are at present under consideration.44.
