l^TH FORTNIGHTLY REPORT SUBMITTED BY THE SECRETARY FOR mines covering THE PERIOD I5TH TO 5IST MARCH,  19UO.GOAL POSITION..Supplies..The supply position has been improved hy the seasonal changein the weather and the consequent decline in the demand for coal forheating and lighting.    During the past fortnight, however, thisfavourable influence has been partly offset by the Easter holidayswhich interrupted production at the pits.    Some interruption was,of course, inevitable but as a result of the efforts which were madeto minimise its effect, the decline in output during Easter *weekcompared with the previous week was only 570,000 tons; thecorresponding drop due to the Easter holidays last year was830,000 tons,A measure of the general shortage of coal has been providedby the increased number of applications for fuel made immediatelyafter Easter hy non-priority industrial consumers who were amongthe first to stiffer from the loss of output occasioned hy the holidays.    Notwithstanding the difficulties experienced by certain   &apos;classes of consumers, the general supply position is, nevertheless,becoming easier and may he expected to improve from now on underthe influence of more favourable weather and the resumed recovery in production.Owing to their remoteness from the producing areas and the interruption of coastwise shipments, London and the SouthernCounties will inevitably be among the last areas to recover fromthe effects of the coal shortage.   This problem continues to receiveclose attention and is being met by the continued railing weekly tothe South of bjo train loads of house coal and 97 train loads ofPublic Utility coal as a supplement to the normal supplies receivedby these areas.    It has not, however, heen thought necessary to askfor the continuance beyond the end of March of priority for coaltraffic generally.

It may be noted in connection with the railing of coal from north to South that the previous decline in the reserves of the gas and Electricity Undertakings in London, and the SouthernCounties has heen stopped and a slight movement in the reversedirection has taken place.     Coal stocks at Gas Works in this regionincreased to 792,000 tons for the week ended 23rd March against775,000 tons in the preceding week.   Likewise, the stocks ofElectricity Undertakings improved to 630,000 tons as compared with621,000 tons,   For the country as a whole, the stocks of all gasundertakings amounted to 1,856,000 tons as compared with 1,852,000tons, while the electricity stocks rose to 1,952,000 tons, against,932,000 tons.Although demand in certain directions normally tends to fallaway at this time of the year, the tendency is least marked in thecase of coal for industrial purposes.   With the ever increasingactivity of the new war industries, industrial demand may, therefore,he expected to remain fairly high.   Nor is it likely, in view oftheir concern&apos;at their stock position, that the Public utility undertakings will wish to relax their efforts to obtain supplies.As regards house coal, although there has undoubtedly heen somediminution in demand which will become more marked as time goes on,the supplies position is not yet sufficiently easy to warrant thegeneral removal of the restriction on deliveries to 2 cwt. per week.However, some modification of the restriction should be possible atan early date.Production and Employment.The gradual recovery of production from the low level of .the week ended 3rd February was interrupted for the first time duringthe Week ended 23rd March, which included the Easter holidays.   AsEaster did not fall in this week last year, the comparison withperformance in the corresponding week a year ago is not valid.The most recent production figures are as follows:-

At the present time this demand continues to exceed the supply of coal available for export and difficulty isfound in meeting the full bunker and cargo needs even of purchasershigh on the priority list.      The quantities of coal exported in-recent weeks have been as follows:-sThe comparison of these figures is invalidated bythe fact that those for 1940 reflect the effect ofthe Easter holidays whereas those for 1939 do not.
