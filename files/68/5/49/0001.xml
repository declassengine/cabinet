Twenty-Eighth Weekly Report on the Oil Position.sss.^ORTS.There is very little change in the stocks of petroleum forthe Services.      The reserves of motor spirit, held in thiscountry for the War Office now exceed those held at theoutbreak of hostilities hy ahout 3 per cent.On the civil side the fall in stocks shown in last week&apos; return of nearly 50,000 tons has heen practically recovered,and the forward position shows some improvement.In relating civil stocks to consumption a new basis has been adopted in Table l(h).      Hitherto stocks have heen shownin terms of week&apos;s consumption calculated on the deliveries hythe Petroleum Board for consumption in the previous four weeks.These deliveries do not in any particular week representactual consumption and they are from time to time affected hyconditions such as had weather, holiday periods, etc.      As aresult of discussion with the Chairman of the Petroleum Boardit is considered that a more suitable basis would be to show the period which current stocks are calculated to last inrelation to probable future consumption.      This is the basisadopted in the present report and it will he followed in futurereports.The number of tankers which arrived in this country duringthe week was twenty-eight, of which five were engaged on admiralty Service.      This follows a good arrival in the previousweek.Particulars in respect of the past four.weeks,  together withthe weekly average for the three pre-war months and for the past six months, are set out in Table II.The total quantity of all products imported during theweek (Table III) was 285,000 tons.      This quantity is thehighest recorded since the outbreak of war and is an increase of17,700 tons over the previous highest figure which was reachedduring December last.The forward programme for the four weeks ending13th April (Table V) also shows an improvement.
