MONTHLY REPORT  (NO. 6) BY THE AIR 1JI-TSTRYOF &quot;SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION,Aircraft.1. The output of aircraft during the month of January,1940 was 857 as compared, with the planned output of 880oThe deficiency was chiefly due to had weather whichinterfered with flight testing and delivery..      It is satisfactory, however.,  to record that deliveries ofHurricane, Spitfire and Defiant fighters totalled 150 during january as compared with 122 in December,,  and thatdeliveries of the heavier bomber types,  ioe0 Whitley5Wellington, Hampden and Hereford, totalled 96 as comparedwith 89 in November and 79 ill December02. Additional orders were placed in this country duringthe month for 2,580 aircraft which will cost,  together withengines, turrets, armament and equipment,  about  53 million,.3. The principal measures for expanding productivecapacity which were approved during the month are asfollows:-(a) In order to meet the growing demand for patrolsover the sea,  it is necessary to increase considerably the provision of flying boats.The capacity of Short Brothers, Rochester,  thedesigners and present constructors ofSunder lands , is being increased threefold.,and capital expenditure on buildings and plant for this purpose to the extent of approximately 387,000 was approved.      Two other firms -Short &amp; Harland, Belfast,  and Blackburn-Denny,Dumbarton     have undertaken the manufacture ofSunderiands.      In addition,  a number of P.B.Y.flying boats are being bought from the UnitedStates to assist in meeting early requirements.(b) The manufacture of Halifax (heavy bomber)aircraft will take place not only in the works of Handley Page Ltd.  (the designers) atCrlcklewood and Radlett, but also in theEnglish Electric Companyfs factory at Preston

(erected, at Air Ministry expense) and intwo new Air Ministry factories at Stokeand Watfordo      The Watford factory willhe managed by the De Havilland Company;arrangements for the management of theStoke factory are not yet complete, butconstruction is being commenced.     TheCricklewood, Radlett and Watford factorieswill make extensive use as sub-contractorsof small firms in the London area where thelabour supply is abundant,  due regard being paid to the duplication of sources of supply on grounds of security.      Further, theproposed L0P.T.Bo railway depot at Aldenhamnear Elstree, which was left unfinishedowing to the outbreak of war, will beccmpleted, equipped for aircraft productionand used in conjunction with the Watfordfactory for the duration of the war.(c) Mention was made in the Fourth Report(Paper No. W.P.(R)(59) 125, paragraph 5)of the manufacture of Lysander (army co-operation) aircraft by a group of scottish firms under the direction ofV/estland Aircraft Ltd.      During January,the provision of plant costing approximately 170,500 for this group was approved.(d) It was decided during January to expand the capacity of a number of aircraft sub-contractors by the provision of plant and.,in a few instances, additional buildings.Particular mention should be made of thePressed Steel Company, Cowley (makingparts of a number of types of aircraft);Automotive Products, Leamington, and .3.E,oSpperman Ltdo, Willesden (makers of under-carriages);    the Brooke ToolManufacturing Company, Birmingham(aircraft jigs and fixtures);    RuberyOwen &amp; Company, Darlaston (parts ofStirling - heavy bomber - aircraft);and the Ratcliffe Tool Company, ParkRoyal (parts of Beaufighter aircraft)0Engines and engine accessories.4. During January, authority was given for theprovision of plant, within a total expenditure of 150,000 for firms working as sub-contractors in

conjunction with the new factory at Accrington to be managed, by the Bristol Aeroplane Company (see first report, W.P.(R)(39)16, paragraph 7).      The provisionof plant, of a similar value, was authorised to equipthe Triumph motor car works which, are to be used forthe manufacture of Hobson carburettors05. Orders for engines are being released inquantities sufficient generally to keep manufacturersemployed until September 1941, and corresponding ordersfor engine accessories are also issued as required,.During January, orders were placed or authorised forupwards of 9,000 airscrews from one contractor alone.Equipment.6. It has been decided,  as a result of recentoperational experience,  that all aircraft shall beprovided as quickly as possible with self-sealingpetrol tankso      This will require the supply of largequantities of rubber, which is under discussion withthe Rubber Controller, and considerable expansionof manufacturing capacity.      During January, approvalwas given for the provision of buildings and plantcosting approximately  60,000 to increase the capacityof one of the firms making the self-sealing covering,the Expander Rubber Company,. Croydon.7. Approval has been given for the provision of machine tools costing approximately  12. 550 toincrease the production of bombsights by theEnglish Electric Company at Stafford,

8. Two firms, the Salford Electrical Instrument Cor&amp;panyand the British Jewel Llanufacturing Company, Salford, are&quot;being provided with   additional machinery for theproduction of ring jewels for instruments, and boules(synthetic stones from which jewels are manufact\u?ed).Armament.9. A review was undertaken during January of theposition with regard to the supply of all types of bombs,and additional orders were authorised in quantitiessufficient to maintain in full production, until April, 19^+1at least, the maximum existing capacity for the productionof each type.     A further detailed review of the whole position is being undertaken by an ad hoc Committee.Balloon Barrage.10. Existing manufacturers of balloons, who are atpresent producing about 250 a month, are capable of workingup to an output of about kOO a month.     A peak output of1,000 a month must be attained in order to achieve the planned establishment of the Balloon Barrage.     An additional150 a month will be produced in the buildings of LittlewoodsLtd., Liverpool, which have been released by the Office ofWorks and are being adapted at a cost of  30,000 and equipped with plant costing  35,000 for the purpose.      Space for production of the balance of requirements will be obtained by the use of Earls Court Exhibition buildings, a part ofwhich will also be available to the Ministry of Supply forthe manufacture of tentage.Raw Materials.11. (a)   Light Alloys.     Steps are being taken to enstirethat all extrusion presses are worked to their maximum

capacity night and day. including mealtimes.Negotiations are in train for the purchase of 1,000tons of magnesium a year for the duration of the war from palestine, and capacity for rolling magnesium sheet is being increased by the provision of two additional mills forRobert Byass &amp; Co., Port Talbot.(&quot;b)    Steelc     Some concern is felt with regard to thesupply of steel, particularly high grade steel, which isrequired for many purposes ranging from airframes, engines and bombs to hydrogen and oxygen cylinders.     This matter isbeing discussed with the Ministry of Supply.(c)    Iridiumo    During January, upwards of 3,000 ozs. ofiridium were purchased by the ^ir Ministry for use in themanufacture of sparking plugs.(&amp;)    Silicol.      Silicol is required by the Air ministry for the manufacture of hydrogen in portable plants forsections of the Balloon Barrage which are required to operate in areas where a supply of hydrogen from gas-works is not readily obtainable.     Norway has been the normal source ofsupply of silicol, but, in view of the vulnerability of this source, arrangements have been made to secure a supply from canada;    2,000 tons of Canadian silicol were ordered during january.(e)   Magnesium powder.     Magnesium powder, which consists of finely divided magnesium metal, is required for themanufacture of signal cartridges, reconnaissance flares andother pyrotechnic stores.     Air Ministry requirements exceed,000 tons a year and will probably rise to over 2,000 tons ayear.     Existing productive capacity is sirfficient for only about h50 tons a year.     In the manufacture of the finergrades of powder certain quantities of the coarser grades are necessarily produced, and in order to ensure the economicalworking of plant, discussions are proceeding with theAdmiralty and the Ministry of Supply with regard to the

desirability of centralising in one Department theresponsibility for providing magnesium powder for all three services and for undertaking the increase of productivecapacity which will be requiredoSummaryo12.
