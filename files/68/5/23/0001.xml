WAR TRADE AGREEMENTS AND RELATIONS WITH NEUTRAL COUNTRIES.The chief event of the week has been the initialling of theNorwegian War Trade Agreement at Oslo on the 23rd February,after long and difficult negotiations0     The Agreement is not as satisfactory as could be wished, but should have the great ad-vantage of securing that the very important Norwegian ShippingAgreement will be carried out in full.      It is hoped that the danish Agreement will be ready for signature shortly.     Thespecial agreements with the Belgian Government will also be signed in the near future,      The  impasse in the negotiations withthe Italian Government continues.    Count Ciano was informed byHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador on the 22nd February that any shipleaving port after March 1st with a cargo of German coal for italy would be liable to be stopped for export control.    Thequestion of German exports to Spain has become a political issueof some importance.2.     The position in the various countries is as follows:NORWAY.3.

Arrangements are being made for the special agreements to be signed at an early datecNETHERLANDS.9. There have been no new developments with regard to theWar Trade Agreement, which is still under discussion by bothDelegations,  and by the French Government,2IIS2ERLANJA10o Apart from items forming the subject of special -Agreements,substantially the whole of the Swiss tariff has  now been allocated to agreed lists,     The French have still to inform us of theProposals for the special agreements which they h.ave undertaken&quot;0 prepare and which comprise the heavy group - ari^^ments, iron ore and copper.      In the meantime arrangements have  been made to

transfer the negotiations from Berne to Paris when outstanding questions affecting special Agreements and the draft text of the notes to be exchanged will be discussed.     The first meeting inParis is due to take place on Thursdays  the 29th February.ITALY.11.

In the meantime,  it has been decided to enforce the embargo on sea-borne German coal destined for Italy,      On the20th February a guarded answer was returned by the Minister ofEconomic Warfare, to a question in the House of Commons on thesubject  of coal shipments from Rotterdam but on the 21st H.M.Ambassador in Rome was informed that any ship leaving port withcoal for Italy after the 1st March would, be liable to be stoppedfor export control.      Sir Percy Loraine conveyed, this decisionto Count Ciano on the 22nd February in a written communication which added that arrangements had been made to facilitate ship-ments of British coal to Italy throughout March irrespective of subsequent arrangements which may be, made between the twoGovernments.13.        Count Ciano&apos;s personal reaction to this communication was reasonable but he warned the Ambassador that Signor Mussoliniwas still in a bad mood and was unlikely at present to cancel the decision of the 8th February., -which created the presentsituation.     However, certain -indications that the Luce&apos;s banas regards aircraft might not prove completely prohibitive,  arebeing explored,Spain/

-k- ftSPAIN.1A.       The signature of the War Trade Protocol is still awaiting the conclusion of negotiations for the general Trade Agreement,which has been delayed by last minute proposals tay the Spaniards.15.        The question of Enemy Exports has been made a politicalissue by the Spanish Government.,      Large quantities of goods ofGerman origin are lying at Genoa,   incurring high storage charges.The Spaniards claim that they have all been paid for and shouldbe exempted from the reprisals order.      In fact,  dates of pay-raent for these goods are extremely difficult  to establish,  and owing to the need for making some concession we have been obligedto make an arbitrary classification of them.      The present in-tention is to&apos; exempt those which arrived, in Genoa before January1st. provided that the French consul there is reasonably satis-lied that they have been finally paid for.      We have given the spaniards no hope that exemptions will be granted for theremaining goods except on very special grounds,HUNGARY.16,        Consultation has been proceeding with the French.
