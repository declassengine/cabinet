FEBRUARY 1-15. 1940.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues, for their information, an analysis ofGerman propaganda for the period the lst-15th February, 1940, which hasbeen prepared by the Department for Publicity in Enemy Countries.H.Foreign Office, February 23, 1940.THIS Analysis of German Propaganda covers the period from the1st to 15th February.The arrangement follows lines similar to those of the previous Analysis.German propaganda is divided into a number of themes intended to providea basis for comparison.Firstly, a short summary is made of the major trends of propaganda during the past fortnight.A brief description is then given of each of these. In the margin beside the items are placed percentage figures showing their comparative importancein relation to the total propaganda directed to (1) the German home popu-lation; (2) Great Britain; (3) France; and (4) neutral countries. In brackets after each figure is shown the corresponding percentage for theprevious fortnight.A table is then given indicating the relative importance of these variouslines of propaganda.Finally, there is given in an Appendix a summary of the confidentialpropaganda &apos;&apos; Leads &apos;&apos; issued by the Propaganda Offices of the national socialist Party and of the German Labour Front during the month ofJanuary 1940.The only event which exercised much influence on the course of german propaganda during the current fortnight was the Russo-German trade agreement announced on the 12th February. The repercussions of theprincipal events during the previous fortnight the German replies &quot;to theFrench Yellow Book, the Asama Maru incident, and Herr Hitler&apos;s speech died away with unusual rapidity.10813-4   [20875] B
The principal lines of German propaganda were, in order of their importance :  1. British Weakness.2. British Brutality and Unscrupulousness.3. German Strength.4. Military Operations.The most important changes were : (a) A considerable decrease in the importance of Allied war guilt, dueto the decline in interest in the French Yellow Book, representing a return to the normal proportion of this theme after the unusualactivity of the previous fortnight.(b) An increase in the themes of German Strength and MilitaryOperations.1. German Strength.Germany, 13% (12%) The conclusion of the Russo-German Trade Agreement caused aFraiiceuty^ 12%) considerable increase in the importance of this theme. Germany&apos;s economicNeutrals, 15% (9j%) strength has in consequence of this pact regained its place as the dominantsub-theme. The agreement, together with her barter system of economy, issaid to render Germany immune to the blockade. German social and culturallife continues to run its normal course. Some play was made with the factthat the Winter Help Relief collected in one day more than the British red cross had collected in five months.In propaganda to France, however, there has been a decrease in the emphasis laid upon the virtues of the German social system, matched by acorresponding decline in attacks upon French social weakness.German strength is the main theme of many of the propaganda filmsnow produced in Germany. The latest and most prominent example is thedocumentary film &quot; Campaign in Poland.&quot;2. Military Operations.Germany,i5j% (13%)        Increased attention has been paid to Military Operations in propagandaFranc&quot;&apos; 6% (4*%)    to a^ countries.  This has been almost entirely due to German air attacks onNeutrals, 15% (9%)   merchant vessels over the North Sea, and to the publication of German figuresof Allied and neutral shipping losses.   The destruction of shipping remainsby far the most important single item in the whole of German propaganda.During the past two months the theme of German success in military,naval and air operations has been given almost twice as much attention in propaganda for home consumption and to the neutrals as in that to GreatBritain or to France.3. Neutrals Oppose Allies.Germany, 3% (6%) Loss of interest in the Asama Marti incident has caused this theme toFrance&apos; 2%m*&apos;) return to its previous level. The incident is kept alive, however, by insistingNeutrals. 2j% (8%)   that JaPan will not be satisfied until all the captured&apos; Germans are returned.Attention was also drawn to Spanish resentment at the French use of spanish emigres in broadcasts to Spain, and Russian indignation at thesearching of the Paris offices of the Soviet Trade Delegation. It is of interest.that the attack in both these cases is directed against France and not against great Britain.4. British Weakness.Germany, 22% (25%) This remains the most important theme in German propaganda.Fraucen,2i%%(i92%r There has been an unusual increase in the attention paid to dissensionsNeutrals&quot; 23% (20%) within the British Empire, in propaganda for home consumption and to neutral countries. This has taken place at the expense of British economicweakness. The two items contributing to the increase were the executionof the two Irish terrorists, and trouble in India due to the breakdown in negotiations between the Viceroy and Mr. Gandhi and to the renewal of fighting on the N.W. Frontier.
In propaganda to Great Britain a long-term survey shows an ever-orov/ing concentration upon British social weakness. The underlying themeis almost invariably : &quot; The rich take the profits, while the poor bear the sacrifices.&quot; This topic occupies about 13 per cent, of the total propaganda to Great Britain, compared with 11 per cent, during the previous fortnight.Special points that have recently been emphasised were : that rationingaffected only the poor, since the rich could take their meals in restaurants;that the evacuated children of the poor receive no education, while thechildren of the rich economise at Eton; and that wealthy officers revel innight clubs, while the wives of private soldiers eke out their inadequateallowances.There has been a decline in the emphasis laid upon British economicweakness. To Germany and to the neutrals most attention has been paid to britain&apos;s shortage of shipping space: to France and to Britain herself, to theimminence of inflation.An example of the &apos;&apos; boomerang &apos;&apos; technique of German propagandawas the allegation that an official inventory is to be made of metal ornamentsin English churches as a prelude to their use for armaments. This is areflection of a similar charge recently made against the Reich administration in Austria.5. French Weakness.This theme, with the decline in interest in the French Yellow Book, has Germany, 2j% (3%)returned to its previous importance.   The emphasis has been shifted from 2 itainj 9%^!%]French social and economic weakness to internal political dissensions, and Neutrals,*6i% (6j%)especially to the opposition to M. Daladier, both within and without his cabinet.  The vote in favour of a secret session was represented as a defeatfor the Government, and the subsequent vote of confidence as merely windowdressing.Social propaganda concentrates on the hardships to the poor caused bythe late introduction of rationing, on profiteering by shopkeepers, and on themiserly allowances and pensions paid to soldiers&apos; families.6. British Brutality and Unscrupulousness.In this, the second most important theme of German propaganda, Germany, 24% (20%)emphasis has shifted  from  Britain&apos;s exploitation of other nations to Britain, i6j% (17%)miscellaneous atrocities.   German propaganda has never at any time given N^11&quot;1Caisl0ig%(&apos;1(22%)Great Britain credit for a single spark of humanity or even common decency,either in this war or in any of the other wars which she has ruthlessly wagedfor 300 years against the continent of Europe.The speeches of Mr. Stanley, Sir Kingsley Wood and Mr. Eden are onlyfurther essays in hypocrisy.The execution of two members of the I.R.A. is the latest, but by no means the last, blood-tribute paid by the brave Irish people in its age-long struggle against the historic oppressor. The same Britain which made itselfresponsible for the atrocious murder of 58,000 helpless Germans in poland was also the father of the slave trade, the opium traffic and the concentrationcamp.   &quot; England, the mask has fallen!&quot;After the eloquence devoted to this subject, the other crimes of which great Britain is accused appear more commonplace. Britain continues herattempts to drive the Balkans, Scandinavia and the Near East into war forher own interests. Neutral ships are lured into her convoys, and thenabandoned at the first approach of danger. &apos;&apos; The coast of death &apos;&apos; is strewnwith the wrecks of neutral shipping.7. French Brutality and Unscrwpulousness.The main stress in this theme is placed upon France&apos;s desire to exploit Germany, 4j% (2*%)other nations.   The charges run parallel for the most part to those made p itain&apos; 4^ (2%)against Great Britain, but special attention is paid to the desire of the Neutrals, 4*%^4%)French press to intervene in Finland.The chief atrocity laid at the door of France is the execution of theAlsatian autonomist Roos.[20875] B 2
8. Britain Lies.Germany, 6j% (6%) German propaganda continued to be extremely sensitive to charges ofFrance,&apos;7% (6%) persecution, especially of the Church, in Poland. Refutations of theseNeutrals, 7% (6%)    allegations received more attention than the usually predominating charge that Great Britain conceals her shipping losses.     Following the usualtechnique, attention was distracted by stories of even greater atrocities com-mitted by the Poles against the Germans.The German press found it necessary to deny British reports that imports from Roumania were being held up on the Russian railways in their passage through Galicia.9. France Lies.Germany, j% (i%) Interest in this theme has declined, especially in propaganda to France.wlance&apos;3% m%) most important single item was the denial that Roos was a member neutrals, 1% (2%)    the German Secret Service.   France was also sometimes coupled with GreatBritain in refutations of stories of atrocities in Poland.10. Allied War Guilt.Germany, 2% (4%) After the exceptional attention paid to the French Yellow Book inFrance&apos; 5%(i3%) January, this line has now dropped to less than a third of its previousNeutrals i% (7j%)   importance.  It remains, however, as an accepted background to the generalpicture presented by every form of German propaganda.   The point mostoften stressed was the usual allegation that the Allies had used Polandmerely as a pretext to get the war they wanted.The Yellow Book continued to be the most important item in propaganda to France.11. Allied War Aims.Germany, 2% (2%) This theme was, as usual, given far more prominence in the GermanBritain, 3% (ii%)    press than on the wireless.   England&apos;s war aims were again unmasked byNeutrals2^&quot;&apos; &quot;(2%)    the publication of  an intercepted  letter  from  a  Consular  official  ineu r  &apos; Peking.   This letter was used to show that Britain wanted to destroy theGerman people and not merely the Nazi Government. For a few days it wasquoted extensively through all the channels of German propaganda.The theme of partition, as opposed to the complete destruction of theGerman nation, was brought out by reference to an article in the Americanpaper News-Week.  The Appendix gives a fuller treatment of war aims.12. German War Aims.Germany. - (-) While bitterly  attacking  the alleged  Allied war  aims,  GermanyFruu&apos;&quot; - -) maintains an almost complete silence about her own. It may be recalled that.Neutrals - (1%)     ^n      early days of the war, Germany herself complained that the Allies hadno war aims, or, if they had any, were afraid to state them.13.

Daladier in propaganda to France, that theNeutrais62% (if%)    French Government is acting solely in the interests of Great Britain.The old charge is still maintained that very few British soldiers are tobe found at the front, and that France is bearing the major burden of the war.14.

It has been suggested to neutrals that their Press should print no reports unfavourable to Germany, and that it is not only un-neutral but dangerous tosail in British convoys or to call at British control ports.(&amp;) It was observed, for the first time, that the British Daily Workerwas quoted to the German home population.(c) Great interest continues to be shown in the activities ofGeneral Weygand in the Near East.
APPENDIX.Summary of Confidential Leads Issued by the Propaganda Offices of the party and the German Labour Front, January 1940.(Twenty-two out of the twenty-four pages of these leads are concerned with england, the other two being reviews of books.)Why England attacked us.The Old Lies no Longer have Effect.Although the English warmongers soon realised that the old catchwords ofthe last war no longer influence the German people, they have long hesitated toreveal their real intentions. Hitherto, they have hoped that it would be enoughto say simply that the war was waged, not against the German people, but onlyagainst &quot; Hitlerism.&quot;But now they are openly saying : &apos;&apos; Even if Hitler was removed the conditions imposed on Germany would be no less severe.&quot; Meantime, one can read also thatit was proposed in London to cut up Germany into innumerable small States, to hand over the Ostmark to Otto von Habsburg, to place Slovakia and Czechia once more under the dictatorship of Benes, and, of course, to deliver over Poland once more to its previous boasting masters.Of course there is nothing more &apos;&apos; harmless &apos;&apos; in this Avorld than England,and nothing more &quot; dangerous &quot; than Germany. England, who possesses a wholeContinent and other vast and valuable territories, who rules over a quarter ofthe earth, has, of course, never striven for world domination. Only Germany,cramped and surrounded in the middle of Europe and not even possessing enoughterritory to nourish her whole population, is accused by the London warmongersof striving for world domination.All these fairy tales are designed only to obtain allies to fight for Britain&apos;interests. The mottoes of &quot; Freedom of the Seas,&quot; &quot; Self-determination,&quot;&quot; German Militarism,&quot; and now &quot;Defence of Democracy against Aggression,&quot;have only served as pretexts to mobilise other peoples against the risingcompetition of Germany.England would find no countries to fight for her if she did not concealher intentions.Why did England really attack us? The reason had nothing to do with england&apos;s slogans.The Social Germany Stands in England&apos;s Way.England&apos;s historic policy has always been to maintain the balance of power.This balance has hitherto been essentially one of physical force, but National-Socialist Germany has created a new factor, that of the Social balance of power.The German example filled jealous men with the fear that one day theirown people might strive to follow the German model, and. demand the same for themselves. The unemployed in other countries demand that what has been donein Germany should be done also for them. These demands do not suit the Englishplutocracy, which has been accustomed to exploit the workers for its own benefit.To have granted these demands would have shattered the whole framework of britain.And because they hate and fear this social Germany, they attacked her and wished to destroy her utterly.Rich England is a Land of Social Devastation.When we speak of an England which rules over a quarter of the world, andpossesses all the riches of the earth, we must not forget that this is not the Englishpeople, but a small upper class and perhaps a certain section of the middle class.The millions of British workers, the small business-man and the small officials, &amp;c,have no share in these riches, but must often live in the bitterest poverty and other conditions which every German would condemn as monstrous.
(Here follows a long personal report of conditions of life in a British slum,and an account of the expulsion from the House of Commons of Mr. Dobbie asa result of his &quot; shattering appeal on behalf of hungry women and children.&quot;)The Author of this Distress: The Jew.Like Germany before the last war, England is a country controlled by theJews. Just as in the Germany of the past, Jews have crept into positions wherethey can direct the English people according to their will.(Here follows a list of 54 Jews occupying prominent positions in Englishpublic life.)England&apos;s only War Aim: The Destruction of the German People.So that is the opponent which, together with elements subservient to theJews, such as Churchill and Company, lias prepared the war against germany for years, and caused its outbreak in the autumn of 1939. To the hate of theEnglish shopkeepers has been added the racial hate of the Jews. This enablesus to discern England&apos;s true aims. Although the English warmongers try to persuade the world that there is a cleft in Germany between the people and theGovernment, they know that it is impossible to destroy the National Socialistregime, because it is deeply anchored in the German people. And so their aimis not the removal of the regime, but the destr uction of the German people, becauseonly in that way can the ideal of the present social community be destroyed.Just as in 1918, they are trying to obtain victory by undermining the InnerFront, after which they would once more &quot; forget &quot; their promises and dictatean even worse peace of starvation than last time.Germany is to be Conquered by Treachery and Assassination.England has already failed to find any nation, except France, to fight herbattles for her. Just as certainly, they have decided in London that nothing canbe expected from the undermining of the German Inner Front.So England puts her hand to her third weapon, herIntelligence Service.The attempted assassination on the 8th November has demonstrated themethods with which England wages war.But these methods will no longer succeed. England has attacked germany without the least provocation and forced her to fight for her existence. germany will conduct the battle with determination until the Reich is finally freed fromEnglish guardianship and arbitrary might.England wants to Dictate her Will to the World.Just as the English plutocracy is trying to undermine the German people with lying slogans, it is daily pouring out lies to the neutral nations. Just as england has been personally commissioned by God to dominate the world, she has also been commissioned by Him to protect the peoples, and especially the littlepeoples.This &apos;&apos; Protectorship &apos;&apos; of England is already very old. England has already taken Malta, Cyprus, Egypt, Aden, India and Burma, and, curiously enough, the&quot; protected &quot; always turned into an English colony.England did not take over German East Africa, Palestine, Transjordan and iraq for strategical reasons, or German South-West Africa because of thediamonds, but only because &quot; Germany was not capable of administering colonies,&quot;or because &quot; the poor Jews &quot; should be given a home, or because Transjordan and iraq were to be educated for &quot; independence.&quot;It was for the same sort of reason that England forced her guarantee uponRumania and tried to do the same to the Baltic States.It is part of this &quot; protection&quot; that England forces neutral ships intoher control harbours and only allows food-stuffs to be delivered on board whenthe Customs Duties have been paid. It is also part of this &quot; protection &quot; thatEngland steals gold and mailbags from these ships, that she confiscates neutral ships and forces them into her service, or threatens Dutch firms in the dutch east Indies with a boycott in order to compel them to dismiss their Germanemployees.
According to the English view it is indispensable for the &quot; protection &quot; ofthe neutrals that they should place themselves, without reserve, under theguardianship of England.With real British cynicism the English Blockade Minister declared that themeasures of his Ministry were not blockade but an internationally recognisedact of ivar.&apos; Yes, in the World War England did not conduct a blockade againstGermany, but by her methods of starvation &quot; only freed the German people fromthe militarism which oppressed it &quot; and if, in the process, more than half amillion women and children literally starved to death, this was scarcely to be avoided.After the World War England hit upon a method by which only those thingsshould be permitted which were acceptable to England. She created the so-called&quot; General Acts &quot; which were signed by the remaining members of the GenevaUnion, but when Chamberlain had returned from his &quot;peace journey&quot; toGermany and had agreed with his comrade Churchill and the remainingwarmongers to declare war on Germany at the hrst opportunity, the first measure to be taken in January 1939 was to declare that England no longer consideredherself bound by these General Acts.Another of England &apos;s creations was the International Court of Arbitrationat The Hague by which all quarrels should be settled peacefully. But when,on the 3rd September, England began an attack against Germany, which she could never have justified before this court, she gave notice on tlhe 4th Septemberof her departure from this institution, in order to avoid such a danger.England&apos;s chicanery, threats and violence to the neutrals, designed to forcethem on to her side, are only another proof for us of &apos;the infinite extent ofBritish hypocrisy and despicability.
