9 Qi/COXWar Trade Agreements and Relations withJReutralsThe  chief question affecting relations with neutrals dealtwith during the week was that of exports of German coal to Italy.After threatening to cause a political dispute of great potential danger,  this question was disposed, of at the end of the week through an unexpectedly satisfactory compromise settlement.      Three  sets ofWar Trade negotiations reached their final stages during the week.The Norwegian Agreement was signed in London on the 11th March.The Danish War Trade, Payments and Shipping Agreements were all hutready for initialling&apos;,  and it was hoped that the Spanish agreement would also he signed very shortly.      Negotiations are proceeding with Latvia and. Hungary,  and a Yugoslav Delegation will shortly open negotiations on the supply of goods to Yugoslavia,  on general financial and commercial relations and on questions arising out of contraband Control.      An important decision has heen taken to rationcotton imports into European neutral countries,  if possible byagreement, but if not by forcible rationing,2.    The position in the various countries is as follows:-NORWAY3.    The Norwegian War Trade Agreement was signed on Monday., the11th March, by Lord. Halifax and Mr.  Cross on behalf of the Govern-ment of the United Kingdom and by Mr.  Colban on behalf of theNorwegian Government.A.    The British members appointed to the Standing commission are Mr,  Charles Hambro and Lord Glenconner, who will be resident inLondon,  and Mr,  G/L,  Paus and Mr* Colin Hugh Smith, who will beresident in Oslo.      The first meeting of the Commission will probablybe held in Oslo in the near future,DENMARK5.    It was hoped to initial the Anglo-Danish &apos;Var Trade agreement and the Payments Agreement on Monday,  the 11th March.      Owing to last-minute/Weekly Report on action taken for theperiod March 3rd - March 10th 1 QhO

last-minute difficulties raised &quot;by the Danish shipowners over theproposed shipping arrangements,  it proved impossible to initial onthat date.      (It was,   in fact,  initialled on the 12th March.)BALTIC STATES6.    Latvia.    Satisfactory progress has been made in thenegotiations with the Latvian Trade Delegation.7.    The proposals made by the Ministry regarding the rationing of raw materials have now been referred for the consideration of theLatvian Government,  and the conversations will he resumed after thereceipt of the latter&apos;s reply.8.    The first transport of flax consigned from the Baltic states to the United Kingdom via Odessa has reached Istanbul.      Efforts arenow being made to send flax via Roumania.BELGIUM9.    It is hoped that the  special agreement on lubricating oils,only one provision of which remains to be settled, will be broughtinto force shortly.THE NETHERLANDS10.    The Netherlands Delegation have proposed that the provisionof the draft War Trade Agreement should be brought into effect atonce without awaiting signature.      In view of the present unsatis-factory position and the danger of the agreement falling through.,the French Government have been informed that His majesty&apos;s government are disposed to accept this proposal.SWITZERLAND11.    Negotiations for a War Trade Agreement, which it was hopedhad reached the final stage,  have been in progress in Paris duringthe past fortnight.      Differences on the Lists, which arose from thediscussions in Berne and still remain to be settled,  involve Swissagricultural products,  their iron-ore,  and the textile groups c:7manuf actures.ITALY12.    As stated in paragraph 9 cf last week&apos;s report,  a request was received/

was received from the Italian Coal Monopoly that the ships loadingGerman coal at Rotterdam and Antwerp should he  allowed to proceed,notwithstanding our notification to the Italian Government that german coal for Italy would he liable to be put into Prize if found in ships which left port after midnight on March 1st.      In view of the strong protest from the Italian Government on the subject of our contraband and enemy export control,  which was received almost atthe same time,   the Cabinet decided to adhere to their decision and torefuse any farther exemption for- German ccal.      Shortly afterwards,however,  the  representatives of the Coal Monopoly in the Netherlandsissued a public announcement that a further exemption had beengranted;    and although this report was promptly denied,  a number ofcolliers (13 in all)  left port on March 3rd, hth and 5th.      on arrival at the Downs they were,  of course,  detained,  and the EnemyExports Committee decided in due course that their cargoes should beput into Prize.13-    In the meantime,  indications were received that there hadbeen a genuine misunderstanding in Rome,  the head of the CoalMonopoly having,   apparently,  understood from the Embassy that nodifficulties were likely to  arise.      In view of this misunderstandingand of the fact that coal exporters in this country were not atpresent in a position- to fulfil their contracts with Italy, much lessmake good the loss which Italy would suffer if the German coal wasdischarged,  the Cabinet decided on March 8th that the italian ambassador should be informed that the ships already detained wouldbe allowed to proceed with their cargoes,  provided the ItalianGovernment undertook that the colliers which were  still in Dutch and belgian ports should not come forward with German coal,  and that nofurther ships should be sent to fetch German coal from those ports inthe future.      This eompronn.se was accepted by the Italian Governmentand an announcement to the same effect was made by agreement betweenthe two Governments in the morning of March 10th.HUNGARY/

1h.    Negotiations in regard to import quotas (rationing)  are proceeding and some measure of agreement has already been reached.15-    The French Government have waived their general objectionsto the quota figures which we had put forward, but have expressed the wish that we should endeavour to secure in all case a a reduction ofthe Hungarian demands to the 1933 import figures at the most.      It is improbable that we shall be able to do so,   since Hungary&apos;s import requirements have been increased since 1933 by accretions of terri-tory,  and by the acceleration of her re-armament programmeoPORTUGAL16.    The fact that Portugal is receiving German goods by air for internal consumption,  and acting as entrepot for German trade withthe Americas, has given rise to some concern.      Sir W. Selby had along interview with Dr.  Salazar on March 7th,  at which,  on theinstructions of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,- he urgedthat Portugal should show a greater readiness to co-operate inaccordance with the spirit of her alliance with us.SPAIN17.    On March 7th,  Sr. Huete of the Spanish Delegation saidthat,  subject to the  question of acceptances,  on which our reply wasawaited, the whole of our text for the Payments Agreement was agreed:The question of acceptances has been settled by the Treasury on lines which the Spaniards had said they would agree.      Our delegation was anxious to sign on March 9th or 11th and to bring the agreement intoforce on March 18th.      It is now reported that the Italian delegationv/hich is negotiating an Italo-Spanish Agreement in Madrid.,  is trying to force the Spanish Government&apos; to postpone signature of our agreemenuntil theirs has been concluded.      H.M.  Ambassador proposes to ask the Spanish Government to fix a date for signature not later thanMarch 15th.18.    Signature of the Agreement and the War Trade provisionslich go with it will clear the way,  we hope,  for more rigorousaction/

faction on our part in regard to contraband--t-r^.fJlLaJaetutfijLn JSpjain -andLermany.      a strict attitude in regard to exemption for German goods[going to Spain is likely- to., reduce reciprocal trade.      The Spanishl-iebt to Germany is,  according to our information,  almost liquidated,and Spain will therefore he unwilling to send her goods to Germanyunless she can get others in return.      A reported increase in thenumber of seizures by the French should also have a salutary effect in reducing the sea-borne traffic.      There remains to be solved thequestion of air-borne  traffic,  which has assumed serious proportions.YUGOSLAVIA19.    A Yugoslav Mission,  consisting of six experts and headed byDr. Gavrilovic,  a senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,has arrived in London with the object of concluding contracts and payment arrangements for the supply of goods which His Mane sty&apos;sGovernment have undertaken to make available in return for the minerals reserved for them under the Minerals Protocol of 11thJanuary 19U-0.20.    Discussions will begin on the 12th March.      The Mission isexpected to he followed in t.en. daysd time by a Delegation consistingof. the Yugoslav Minister in London and the Vice-Governor of therational Bonk of Yugoslavia, who will he assisted hy Dr. Gavrilovic.This second Delegation will discuss general financial and commercial relations and in particular questions arising out of Contraband Contr21.    Tentative negotiations initiated with a view to acquiringIranian cotton have made no progress,      An Iranian-Russian trade agreement is now a possibility.      This, combined with the inability of the united Kingdom to supply Iran with the goods she requires -mainly armaments and railway material - and our reluctance to pur-chase what she produces,  is likely to create a difficult position.AFGHANlST-AN22.    No response to our offer to buy cotton has heen received.J-t is understood that a good deal of the old crop has been spoiltby exposure./

by exposure.THAILAND23.    Pending consideration of the major issue of the pre-emption of China&apos;s output of wolfram, no action is being taken towards pre-empting Thailand&apos;s production.      In the meantime saleson a small scale are being made to Japan,JAPAN2h0    The problems created by the export of rubber and tinfrom the Dutch East Indies to Vladivostok are still under conside-ration.      Pr&quot; -emotion of &quot;Mis Japanese whale oil catch is alsounder consideration      We are faced with the alternatives of paying a stiff price with inconvenient delivery or the possibility of seeing part of the oil going to Russia and thence to Germanyafter being hardened in Japan,U.S.A,  and Sout-2 America25,    As the result of the study of the problem of cotton imports into contiguous neutral countries, His Majesty&apos;s G-overn-ment have now decided to adept a policy of rationing these imports,if possible by agreement with the  countries concerned, but,  if not?by forcible  rationing,      Arrangements are being made to put thisdecision into effect as soon as possible,26,    Discussions are taking place on the question of startinga Black List in the U.S.A.   and a list of firms to whom the Contra-band Committee will refuse Navicerts has been sent to His Majesty&apos;?Embassy at Washington,27,    A meeting has been held with the European representativeof the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in an attempt to securethat company1 s co-operation in the temporary embargo on the import,&apos;of lubricating oil to Denmark; Holland and Belgium,   a co-operation which this company alone of the large American producers isfailing to provide, .20,    The question of forming a new Phosphate cartel, with aview&apos;to securing a complete  control at the producing end,  has been raised/

-7-287raised,and an interdepartmental meeting will shortly he called to take the discussions further.29.    Discussions have also taken place with the London rep-resentative of the Kennecote Copper Company in order to investi-gate the report of His Majesty1s Ambassador at Santiago that this company through its Braden subsidiary has been selling importantamounts of copper and molybdenum to Japan for transhipment toGermany via Vladivostok,II. CONTRABAND AND ENEMY EXPORT AGREEMENTS30.    In the past week, general guarantees of non-re-exporta-tion to Germany have been signed by three further subsidiaries of the American S.O.G.O.N.Y,  Vacuum Company viz,  Raffineria diNapoli, Vacuum Oil Company, S. A. I.,  Italy,  and Vacuum Oil CompanyA.G.,  Basel;    also by three further subsidiaries of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company,  viz,  Sinclair Petroleum Company,  S.A.,Brussels,  &quot;B, P.&quot; Benzine &amp; Petroles S.A.,   Zurich;  and BenzinaPetroleum (B.P.) S.A., , Trieste:;  also by a further Standard Oilsubsidiary,  Standard-Mineralvelprodukte A.G.,  Zurich.General Prize Questions31.    The Contraband Committee considered the question of the implications of the Anglo-Greek War Trade Agreement as regardsgrounds for seizure and for refusal of Navicerts respectively5the Contraband Committee decided that:a) the mere fact that the consignee is on the Black Listor Statutory List could not of itself justify seizure,unless there were evidence of an intention to evadethe Greek ex-port prohibitions:b) when a Quota is fixed there would be a right to seizein a case of shipments in excess of the quota:c) the Committee are not bound  to grant Navicerts to statutory/

Statutory and Black List consignees:d)    refusal of Navicerts should he a main means of enforcingquotas, hence the Committee propose to refuse Navicertsin any cases where the quota is full,CONTRABAND CONTROL32.    During the week ending 9th March 86 new cases of ships were dealt with and 47 previous cases,  in regard to whose cargoes or items thereof enquiries had been completed, were disposed of,33-    In 68 cases entire cargoes were released,  either on first consideration or after enquiries,3k&apos;    The system under which advance copies of manifests of cargoes are received and considered before the ships arrival at ports in this country resulted,  during the week under review,  in59 cases being so dealt with andin 33 cases of the ships concernedbeing released by the Committee subject merely to the formalchecking of the original manifests on their arrival at the control bases and of k ships being given &quot;Missing Kirkwall&quot; clearances.In addition to these  immediate releases,   in 5 other cases theCommittee&apos; s decision to release was given within :j days or less of the arrival of ships at the Control Bases.      Of ships released23 sailed under Hold-Back Guarantees,Navicerts-35-    Since the introduction of the Navicert system 30,992applications for navicerts have been received up to the 9th March.Of these 23*886 have been granted ana 1SU56 refused, while 5*650are pending or have not yet been presented for consideration.ENEMY. EXPORTS36,    The Committee met 6 times this week,  and reviewed in all25 ships,  among which were 13 Italian ships that had. sailed fromRotterdam for Italy with cargoes of German coal after 1st March.Another/

Another ship which had been detained in the Downs had started onthe 1st March but had been delayed by engine trouble;  and it was directed that she should be allowed to proceed.      In respect ofthe other thirteen,  the Committee ordered the coal to be dischargedand placed in Prize.      The subsequent decision of His majesty&apos;s government regarding these ships has been recorded in paragraph 13above.37.    The Committee considered 161  specific applications for exemption or for a reversal of previous refusals, granting 14*refusing 86 and deferring consideration of 61.      In addition,  163were treated summarily, 32 being granted and 131 refused.      Theadvice of the Committee was also sought in a number of cases inwhich His Majesty&apos;s Consuls were uncertain whether certificates of origin should be granted.38.    Among the general subjects discussed by the Committeewas the question of payments to Germany in respect of royaltiesand patent-licences.      The Committee thought that it would begoing too far to say that, wherever there was a royalty, howeversmall,  the goods in respect of which the royalty was payable mustbe treated as goods in which the enemy had an interest,  so thata certificate of interest could not be given;    but it was agreed in principle that a small royalty payable to the enemy shouldrightly be considered as part of the cost to the manufacturer and taken into account in calculating the 25!o cf eneiay ingredient.The Committee felt that a full investigation of the question was desirable;    and it appointed a sub-committee to suggest someworking principles for the guidance of the Committee.
