MINISTRY   OF   FOODREPORT FOR MARCH 1940.Part I.1.   CONTROL OF IMPORTS.The import of the major foods tuffs is already under the control of theMinistry of Food.     Some, but not all, of these can be imported under an ImportLicence.     Certain foodstuffs are subject to import licensing, but are not atpresent controlled by the Ministry, while others have not hitherto been subjectto any control at all.In order to complete the control of imports of foodstuffs, a general order is being made prohibiting the import of almost all foodstuffs except undera licence.     (The exceptions are wines and spirits, fresh and cured fish, and live animals).     The Order will be published on Thursday, 21st March, and will apply to all foodstuffs not already subject to licence which are despatched afterthe 20th March and arrive in this country after the 27th March.In view of the large increase in administrative work likely to be involved in this rapid and extensive control of imports, it is proposed that the licences to be granted in respect of the import of particular foodstuffs will be divided for the time being, into the simplest possible categories;    that is tosay, certain commodities from certain countries will be temporarily prohibited,while, in the case of other commodities from other countries, open generallicences will be granted.     In a number of cases, despite the administrativelabour involved, it will be necessary to give more specific and limited licences.However, with the development of the new controls and with the full developmentof the new machinery, it is hoped to introduce a greater degree both ofprecision and flexibility into the import restrictions, either by an extensionof centralised purchase or by a more detailed and particularised control withregard to licences.As from the end of March, therefore, all foodstuffs imported into theUnited Kingdom will be subject to the control of the Ministry of Food or theImport Licensing Department of the Board of Trade.     The efficiency of these controls should rapidly increase once the first shock of the change has been overcome, so as to regulate imports in accordance with the numerous and sometimes conflicting considerations of national policy.

II. NEGOTIATIONS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES.Negotiations for purchase of Italian foodstuffs remain in abeyancepending Mr. Playfair&apos;s visit to Rome.The Ministry has been engaged in protracted negotiations with the danish representative about the quantities and prices of their commodities to be imported in the coming months.     Agreement had been reached with the otherdepartments concerned that, in order to reduce dependence on a precarious source of supply and to effect economies in total imports of butter and bacon,progressive cuts should be made in the quantities imported during the current year.     It is proposed that bacon imports will now run at the rate of 2,500 tonsa week as from the beginning of March in place of 3,500.     Butter imports will be1,600 tons a week during March and 1,500 tons thereafter compared with 1,660 tonsa week which Denmark has been sending during the first quarter when imports are normally low.     It is contemplated that the annual rate of import will be around60,000 tons in place of nearly 90,000 a year which was the estimated annual ratebefore the negotiations began.     It is not proposed to reduce Danish imports ofeggs for the present owing to the precarious condition of home supplies, or tomake any cut in imports of condensed milk and other commodities.     A start hasbeen made on a scheme, which arises out of the War Trade Agreement initialledlast week, for the co-operative purchase of Danish f eedingstuff s and the diversion of these purchases into, the sterling area.In the past week the Ministry saw representatives from Holland with aview to allocating between the various imported commodities the reduction inguilder expenditure ( lm.) which the Treasury has asked the Ministry to bringabout during the next five months.Negotiations for the purchase of the Norwegian whale oil catch havebeen concluded and it is hoped to dispose of some part of the unexpectedly largebalance (107,000 tons) to Denmark.On March 13th, the Ministry saw representatives from Eire and negotiations are still proceeding whereby in return for a shipping agreement Eiremay agree to reduce her cereal and feeding stuffs import programme.The Ministry has been represented at meetings to discuss the proposedWar Trade Agreement with Latvia and in order to satisfy the existing trade agreements with the Baltic States, has promised to offer to take quantities oftheir butter and bacon corresponding with their past share in imports, but

subject to competitive prices and c.i.f. terms which may make such importsimpossible.The Board of Trade and the Treasury have proposed to adjust tradebalances by diverting purchases of coffee from Costa Rica to Colombia.     TheMinistry is prepared, if it be so desired, to further this result by the workingof the import licensing system.The Ministry has had further consultations with the other departmentsconcerned on the possibilities of pre-emptive purchases from Balkan Countries,and negotiations are still on foot to implement the decision to purohase maizein Rumania and Bulgaria up to 200,000 tons during April, May and June.III. ANGLO-FRENCH CO-OPERATION.The Anglo-French imports programmes have now been brought to a point where they are usefully comparable as minimum programmes.     French estimates for february-July 1940 have now been submitted for examination by a Joint ProgrammesSub-Committee so soon as the British estimates are available.     In order tofacilitate the preparation of future programmes, a questionnaire has been agreed by the Anglo-French Food Executive for submission to the two Governments.Steps are being taken by the Anglo-French Food Executive in collaboration with the joint Executive for Economic Warfare to hasten forward thejoint purchase of maize from the Balkans to prevent it falling to German buyers.Consideration is also being given to the co-ordination of sales ofBritish and Empire supplies of cocoa.IV. GENERAL REPORT ON SUPPLY, CONSUMPTION AND STOCKS.1. The statistical position of food and feeding stuffs is shown inPart VII of this report.     Table I gives monthly particulars of bulk stocks sincethe outbreak of war projected to the end of May 1940, together with the number of weeks&apos; supply on the basis of the estimated stocks in May.     Table II givesparticulars of supply, consumption and total stocks for February, with forecasts for March, April and May.     The data are based on all imports which are expectedto arrive in the months shown, but no account has been taken of losses at sea andthe allowances for delays in loadings or voyages may prove inadequate.     Sinceshipping tonnage has not yet been arranged for a large part of the May importsthe predictions for that month must be regarded as less reliable than those for march and April.Matters of special interest in respect of the more important commodities are dealt with in the following paragraphs,,

o o riti- lj U2. WHEAT.In the fifth report reserve stocks of wheat and flour in mills andpublic warehouses at the end of March 1940 were estimated at 1,495,000 tons or12.5 weeks&apos; flour consumption at the present rate of about 120,000 tons of wheatper week.     Reserve stocks are defined as total stocks of wheat and flour heldin mills and public warehouses, minus the wheat equivalent (155,000 tons) of the113,000 tons of flour held in mills and port warehouses on 18th November 1939,which quantity has been taken as the minimum working stock.     Had it not been for the order to release 40,000 tons of imported wheat for animal feed and theearmarking for livestock of one-half instead of one-third of the home-producedcrop, the estimate given last month of reserve stocks at the end of March wouldhave been realized.     Assuming no losses of wheat afloat, it is now estimatedthat reserve stocks at the end of March will be equivalent to 12 weeks1 supply.Imports in April-May, plus the proportion of the home crop likely tobe marketed, are expected to be little in excess of total consumption.     Reservestocks at the end of both April and May are therefore expected to equal about12 weeks1 supply.     In view of the present shipping position, only by making afurther serious reduction in imports of feeding grains could the 13 weeks&apos;reserve of wheat, regarded by the Cabinet as a minimum for the end of March, beaccumulated by the end of June.3. ANIMAL FEEDING- STUFFS.Owing to the necessity of economizing shipping space, the main burdenof which has fallen on feeding stuffs, the imports envisaged in the fifth reporthave been subjected to further reductions.     Imports of maize in March-May 1940are now forecast at only 43,000 tons a week or 65$ of the 1936/38 weekly average,while the comparable figures for barley are 8,000 tons and 44$,     In order to implement the undertaking to allocate to distributors not less than two-thirds of the normal quantities of imported cereal feeding stuffs, 40,000 tons of wheatimported from France have been released for feeding.     Stocks of cerealfeeding stuffs at ports and in the hands of distributors are negligible and the continuation of the present rate of distribution is entirely dependent uponprompt arrivals at the normal ports.     Any unexpected delays or losses ofshipping may therefore result in failure to maintain the promised allocation.Stocks of oilcake are also extremely small and the maintenance of thepresent rate of distribution is therefore dependent upon the quantities receivedfrom crushing mills and by direct importation.     As a result of the diversion of

ships that would normally have brought cottonseed cake from Egypt, and the lowproduction in February by crushing mills, considerable difficulties are being experienced in maintaining the continuity of deliveries and the balance between different types of cakes required for the various classes of livestock.4.   SUGAR.The quantity of sugar released in February to wholesalers and retailers was smaller than that forecast in the fifth report.     This saving isattributed to a reduction of stocks and hoardings by retailers and consumers.Bulk stocks of sugar have been maintained at a figure slightly below the Decemberlevel;   some further reduction is expected in March and April.The control of supplies of sugar issued to manufacturers came intooperation on 1st February and considerable savings in the quantities used havealready been effected.     Stocks held by manufacturers are being adjusted to the equivalent of four weeks&apos; requirements.     Despite rationing of domestic consumersand the strict control of distribution to manufacturers, some variation in consumption from month to month is inevitable.     The requirements of the jammanufacturing trade and domestic jam makers are seasonal.     Moreover, eachexpansion in the number of men in the forces adds to the total consumption of sugar owing to the difference between military and civil rations.There is a serious deficiency of shipping space booked to lift sugarfrom the British West Indies during their heaviest production period (i. e. March-May),5. MEAT.Imports of meat in February, although at a lower rate than during thethree preceding months, were sufficient to maintain consumption without decreasingstocks.     Large imports are expected in April and May, shipments from New Zealandbeing in excess of the normal seasonal movement.     The severe weather in the early part of February caused a temporary reduction in supplies of home-produced meat,but since then normal supplies of livestock have been coming forward.     Thereduction of supplies of animal feeding stuffs has not, so far, affected thequality of cattle marketed.     Frost damage to root and green fodder crops has,however, resulted in many unfinished sheep being offered for sale.The control of meat and livestock has functioned reasonably well.The hesitancy of farmers, in the early days of control, to send their stock tothe collecting centres and the delays in marketing home-killed stock caused bysevere weather were both overcome by the utilization of ample and well distributed

stocks of imported meat.     No serious difficulties have been experienced in operating the schedules of maximum retail prices.The effect of meat rationing, which was commenced on 11th March, on consumption cannot yet been assessed.     As in the case of the other rationed foods, it is expected that the full equivalent of the coupons will not be purchased.     The estimates of consumption during March-May 1940 are based on the expectation that the civilian population will, on the average, use about      lbs.per head per week, or ^ lb, less than could he purchased on the basis of thecoupon value of l/lOd.The estimates of civilian consumption of home-killed and imported meatduring March-May 1939 and 1940 follow: -Total Civilian Consumption   Of which % home-killed1959                 1940 1959 1940&apos;00Q tonsBeef and veal                                         314                  240 50.3               63.8Mutton ana lamb                                      145                  148 36.6               32.4Pork                                                          55                    62 85:5               87.1Offal                                                         41                    38 61.0               60.5Total 555 488 51.0 57.0The consumption of meat by H.M. Forces during March-May is estimatedat 49,000 tons.In the unlikely event of civilian consumption during March-Mayreaching the full weight equivalent (i.e. if lbs. per head per week) of the ration,stocks at the end of May will be about 100,000 tons.     Having regard to thepossible decline in the rate of marketing home-killed meat and bearing in mind that, owing to sinkings and delays, the present estimates of imports may not be fully realised, a reserve of 100,000 tons cannot be considered excessive.     Buton the basis of the probable rate of consumption, and disregarding the uncertainties due to possible sinkings and delays, total stocks of meat at theend of May are estimated at 173,000 tons.     If this estimate is realised, 140,000tons will have to be placed in cold store together with about 35^000 tons ofbacon and 80,000 ions of butter, making a total for the three commodities of255,000 tons.     The provision of cold storage for this total tonnage would presentserious difficulties.     There appears to be little likelihood of increasing theconsumption of either bacon or meat, but the consumption of butter is expected tobe increased shortly.     Thus it is improbable that cold store stocks of meat,bacon and butter will be as great as 255,000 tons.

6. BACON AND HAM.As a result of action taken to reduce imports the supplies received in.February were lower than those forecast in the fifth report and stocks, which wereapproaching dangerously high levels, have been reduced to more reasonabledimensions.     A further expansion of stocks is, however, expected in March owingto the arrival of supplies already purchased.     The arrangements made with denmark, and certain other countries, to reduce exports to the United kingdom should reduce stocks from April onwards.     Difficulties have recently occurred in continuing the restrictions on the home production of bacon, owing toimpracticability of diverting the desired number of pigs from the bacon to thepork and manufacturing trades.     An increased home production of bacon istherefore being permitted.     If consumption is maintained at the present level,which is the same as in peace time, stocks are unlikely again to becomeembarrassingly large.7. MILK.The total production of milk in England and Wales during January and february was 8.7$ and 8.8$ respectively less than in the same months of 1939.While the lower level of production is partially attributable to the severe weather conditions, the main cause is the shortage of feeding stuffs.     further steps are being taken to ensure that dairy cattle receive preferential treatment.Of the 71 million gallons of milk produced in February, 61 million gallons (85.6$) were used in liquid form and 10 million gallons (14.4$) weremanufactured.     The daily consumption of liquid milk declined in February by 2.6$as compared with February 1939.     This is attributed largely to the fall in thequantity of milk supplied under the Milk-in-Schools Scheme, which was reduced from ,6 million gallons in February 1959 to 1.7 million gallons in February 1940.The reduction in the supplies of cereal feeding stuffs to two-thirds of the normal, together with the decrease in supplies of oilcake, are expected toreduce milk production by about 15$ during March and the first half of April, ascompared with the same period of last year.     The increase in grazing after themiddle of April should partially offset the shortage of feeding stuffs.8. BUTTER AND MARGARINE.Imports of butter continue to exceed requirements on the basis of a four ounce ration and, although arrangements are being made to reduce imports from denmark and Holland, the expected imports in March and April will be considerably in excess of the present level of consumption.     An Import Prohibition Order has7.

been imposed under which it is proposed, so far as possible, to withholdlicences except where purchase agreements have already been negotiated.Although there has recently been a slight increase in the demand for butter, thequantity distributed is still appreciably below that required to meet a fourounce ration.     Stocks have, therefore, continued to rise.     This increase in stocks has made it necessary to increase the butter ration to eight ounces per head per week.     On the basis of the present rate of consumption it isestimated that cold storage stocks will be about 85,000 tons at the end of april and about 90,000 tons at the end of May.     It is not possible to estimate theextent to which these figures will be reduced by the doubling of the ration, butit is hoped that it will be substantial.The consumption of margarine, which prior to the outbreak of waraveraged 4,000 tons a week, increased to an average of 6,200 tons a week duringthe six weeks before the rationing of butter commenced on 8th January.     Duringthe following six weeks the weekly rate of consumption of margarine was6,700 tons.     In contrast, the weekly average consumption of butter, includingcaterers&apos; and other requirements^ is now only about 5,200 tons compared with a normal figure of about 10,000 tons.9. CHEESE.In order to limit prices and to reduce expenditure of hard currenciesfor Canadian and Dutch cheese, partial control is being introduced.     The control will take the form of an Import Prohibition Order, to come into effect on1st April.     The issue of a Maximum Prices Order is also under consideration.It is thus hoped to avoid for the present the particularly difficult task of controlling the distribution of cheese.The uncontrolled importation of Canadian cheese at high pricescontinues to prejudice the Ministry&apos;s negotiations for the bulk purchase of canadian cheese.     But despite urgent representations, no reply has beenreceived from Ottawa to the Ministry&apos;s latest proposals regarding purchases.Stocks of cheese at the end of February were about 14,000 tons ascompared with about 18,000 tons at the outbreak of war.     Consumption continuesat about the normal level,10. OILSEEDS AND NUTS:   VEGETABLE AND MARINE OILS.Imports of oilseeds and nuts in February exceeded expectations, whilethe quantity passing through crushing mills averaged only 27,000 tons per weekcompared with the forecast of 34,500 tons given in the fifth report.     Stocks8.

of oilseeds are, therefore, higher than anticipated, &quot;but are expected to declinesince the throughput of the mills must be increased to meet the needs of the oilutilising trades.Vegetable oils are divided for manufacturing purposes into three categories, ioe0 hard and soft edible oils and technical oil.     Owing to the low level to which stocks of soft oils had fallen, and the need to ensure supplies for use in margarine and compound lard, it became necessary (a) to restrictallocations to other users of these oils and (b) to concentrate on imports ofnuts and seeds producing soft oils.     The balance of stocks has now improvedconsiderably and should continue to improve during the present month.     It hasbeen necessary to restrict also the allocations of linseed oil except to manufacturers of oilskins and gas protective clothing.     Allocations of whale oilhave, however, been increased to certain manufacturers to make good the deficiency of soft oilsoThe new season&apos;s British catch of whale oil, estimated at 130,000 tons,is expected to arrive in May and June.     This will again bring the level of stocks to that obtaining at the commencement of the war, i.e. about 300,000 tons.A further large quantity of Norwegian whale oil, which may amount to nearly100,000 tons has also been purchased.     The arrival of these supplies will bespread over the remainder of the year.11. DRIED FRUIT.It is too early to form a definite judgment on the results of the advertising campaign to increase the sale of sultanas.     The advisability of advertising figs is under consideration.     Of the stocks of 54,000 tons of driedfruit held by the Ministry on 1st March, 13,000 tons have been distributed to thetrade.     The dried fruit trade is normally highly seasonal and more than one-halfof the total annual peace-time consumption of about 180,000 tons was distributedduring the two months before Christmas.     The present stock is considerably abovenormal and purchases already arranged with Turkey under the trade agreement will further increase the supplies.     On the other hand, the cessation of purchases ofevaporated fruit, such as prunes, from the United States should soon result inthe disappearance of these fruits from retailers&apos; shops.     It is hoped that the rationing of sugar will help to increase the consumption of sultanas and dates.12. FISH.The war at sea has had a marked effect on supplies of fish;   inJanuary 1940 the quantity landed was only 25,000 tons compared with over

50,000 tons in January 1939.     The average prices paid at the ports were morethan doubled during the same period (from 2/2d. a stone in January. 1939 to5/ld. a stone in January 1940).     Estimated landings in Pebruary were about 12$more than in January, while the price fell by about 10$.     The increased prices have attracted much heavier supplies of frozen fish from abroad, particularlyfrozen cod from Newfoundland, the imports of which are still increasing.Vo PRICES.The Ministry of labour&apos;s Index Number of food prices at March 1stremains at the same level as a month earlier, a rise in the prices of eggs,margarine and cheese having been approximately balanced by a fall in bacon andfish.     The fall in bacon, (averaging if d. per pound) resulted from the revisedMaximum Prices Order which came into force on Pebruary 5th.     The increase inmargarine averaged rather over -g-d. per pound and was due to the increase of Id.per pound in the prices of the dearer qualities which also took effect onFebruary 5th.     Arrangements were, however, made to insure that there should heno increase in the price of the cheapest margarine which remains at 5d,As far as can be judged, there is not likely to be a substantial change in the food index figure for April 1st.     Retail prices of potatoes willbe raised under the revised Prices Order which is expected to come into forcebefore the end of the month, and the average increase in maximum prices is ofthe order of l-gd^ to 2d. per 7 pounds.     The reduction in fish prices during february cannot be regarded as more than a temporary fluctuation.     On the otherhand, retail prices of eggs have been declining since the beginning of the month,and this downward movement will probably continue.     The issue of a maximum prices Order for cheese would effect a reduction of as much as Id. per pound inthe average figure.     In any case, the tendency of cheese prices is nowdownwards.     (it may be observed that the rise in cheese amounting to 2jd, perpound, according to the Ministry of Labour&apos;s figures between 1st December and1st March, is almost entirely; due to the higher prices of home-produced cheese.This has only been available in very limited quantities, but imported cheese canbe purchased for considerably less than the Ministry of Labour&apos;s figure.)The Retail Price Pood Index may, therefore, be expected to show nochange, or at most only a small increase on April 1st.

VI. SHIPPING-.The Ministry of Shipping has established a Central Charteringorganisation to avoid, competitive chartering by Government Departments.     TheMinister of Pood has concurred in the arrangements and the chartering of neutralshas accordingly passed out of the hands of the City Office of the FreightDepartment.     The City Office is continuing;, by arrangement with the Ministry of food, to charter coastal tonnage for the carriage of wheat from Prance.The following table illustrates the incidence of the increase of freight rates on some of the principal foodstuffs.     The table does not includerates of freight on requisitioned Tramp tonnage which have not yet been definitely agreed.August 1939.   January 1940.

(By the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in conjunction with theSecretary of State for Scotland).Ploughing up Campaign,In England and Vfales the acreage selected for ploughing by the CountyWar Agricultural Committee now amounts to 1,396,000 acres as compared with theminimum task communicated to them of 1,350,000 acres.     Directions to ploughhave &quot;been served in respect of 1,236,000 acres.     Applications for ploughing-upgrant cover 1,100,000 acres.     The area actually ploughed increases from day today and the last available figure (March 14th) is 933,000 acres.In Scotland Committees were asked to aim at securing an increase of260,000 acres.     It is estimated that 82,000 acres had actually been ploughed byFebruary 15th and considerable progress has been mads since that date.     Noticesof intention to plough 253,000 acres of old grassland under the subsidy schemehave been received.In Northern Ireland, applications for ploughing-up grant cover 226,000acres.     The war-time task is 250,000 acres.Although in some parts of the country it has only been possible forfarmers to get on to the land during the last fortnight (up to March 15th) the weather has been favourable for nearly a month and the prospects for overtaking atleast part of the heavy arrears of work which existed in the middle of Februarycan be regarded as good.The rate of contracting for sugar-beet growing is higher than a yearago, and the deficiency in.the acreage signed up as compared with last year isbeing steadily reduced.Ploughing-up Grant.In view of farmers1 difficulties during the severe weather, it hasbeen decided to extend the period during which grassland ploughed up for the1940 harvest is eligible for grant from 31st March to 30th April.     A further extension to 15th May is to be allowed for grassland ploughed up and sown tocertain crops, mainly root and fodder crops0

Machinery and Implements,Since last summer the number of tractors in the country has increased,some 25 per cento and there have been very considerable sales of all kinds ofimplements.     The demand for both tractors and implements is still heavy, andsome delay on the part of manufacturers in meeting orders of individual farmersis still inevitable.     County Committees have been supplied with all the tractorsand almost all the implements they need this spring,.The provision recently made for the lighting of tractors for nightwork is helping considerably in the effort to overtake arrears of ploughing andcultivation.     Petrol rationing for farmers, under the Scheme which was introduced earlier this year, has operated smoothly0Seeds and Fertilisers-Very few complaints are now being received about difficulties ofobtaining cereal seed, and the market price of seed oats has been falling,,     Thesupply of seed oats and seed wheat is considered sufficient to permit the exportof limited quantities to Eire,     With the exception of certain varieties thesupply of horticultural seeds is not unsatisfactory.In Northern Ireland distribution has commenced of the flax seed andseed barley purchased by the Ministry0&apos; No appreciable change has occurred in the fertiliser position.     Themaximum prices of superphosphate, ground phosphate and compound fertilisers(controlled by the Ministry of Supply) have been further advanced, andsuperphosphate now costs 44 per cent-, more than a year ago.     The increase in price is due to additional costs of importing the raw materials0Oredot 0In Scotland arrangements have been made with the Banks by which special credit facilities will be given to farmers who find difficulty inobtaining credit in the ordinary way.     These arrangements will securesubstantially the same results as the Agricultural Requisites Assistance scheme in England and Wales.     In Northern Ireland&apos;a credit scheme also analagous tothe Agricultural Requisites Assistance Scheme has boon put into operation and provides loans for the purchase of seeds and fertilisers,Man Power.In February agricultural unemployment reached the high level of50,000.     With better weather this surplus is being once again converted into ashortage, having regard to the fact that most of the unemployed men are either15.

casuals or unemployables.Applications for release of farm workers from the Forces exceed the quota agreed by the War Office.     Discussions are taking place, however, with theService Departments in the hope of securing agreement to certain further proposalsfor enabling soldiers to assist farmers.     The War Office have agreed to thetemporary release of 200 skilled threshers where certified as urgently required.Seven thousand applications for postponement of service resulted from the october and December registrations for Great Britain which was equal to roughly80 per cent, of the numbers registered.     The proposition in respect of the Februaryregistrations is even greateri     It is estimated that some postponement can beallowed in respect of 85 - 90 per bent, of the applicants.la addition to the above the Agricultural Departments have under activediscussion with other Departments the following proposals for augmenting labourseuppliesj   it is hoped that it will be possible to authorise AgriculturalExecutive Committees to organise mobile gangs of workers;   a special auxiliaryforce of women will be organised by the Yeomen1 s Land Army to work at least four weeks at the busy period;   proposals are being worked out for employing boys at school or who have left school, and also volunteers, undergraduates, andconscientious objectors;   and the British Sugar Corporation is to be permitted toassist in the recruitment of Irish workers to help harvest this year1s beet crop$All forty-seven Agricultural Wages Committees in England and wales have now increased the minimum rates.     When all decisions become operative theaverage for the country will be 37/10 or 9 per cent, higher than the average onSeptember 1st.     Revised rates representing an increase of from 5 to 10 per cent,over pre-war rates will become effective throughout Scotland on 18th March.The effective strength of the Women&apos;s Land Army in England and Walescan now be estimated at 12,000 - 13,000.     Five thousand of these are already in agricultural employment, and an additional 1,000 are trained.     Of the remains6,000 - 7,000 only 10 or 15 per cent, are not in non-agricultural employment ofsome sorte     In Scotland the number of enrolled members reaches almost 1,000,Of these 170 are in employment and over 200 are trained or&apos; experienced andawaiting employment.

Apart from the general shortage of feeding stuffs, farmers continueto complain of the lack of straight feeds, and of the unsatisfactory quality and high prices of compound and mixed feeds.     Proposals are under considerationto limit the volume and number of varieties of compounds and to standardise theircomposition and price.     At the same time the Agricultural Departments areexploring the desirability of restricting the sale of mixtures.     It is believedthat an alteration of distributive methods on these lines would have beneficialeffects and be welcome to farmers.     Although such a change would materiallyalter trade practice, especially as it has developed during the war, a reversion to earlier methods would better accord with the changes in farm practice inducedby the ploughing up campaign.Other measures to improve distribution are under consideration but no effective action can be taken pending a decision regarding the level of suppliesof imported feeding stuffs during the ensuing six months.Livestock.Marketings of livestock are now reaching more normal levels.     Certainadjustments in the scheme of livestock control and purchase are to be put intooperation shortly and should remove a number of causes of criticism.The Farmers1 Unions have, however, represented that feeding costs,especially of pigs, have increased in excess of the allowance made when thepresent scale of fat stock prices was introduced in January, largely owing tothe high cost of compounds and mixtures and the use of inferior ingredients whichlengthen the fattening period.     These representations are shortly to be examined by the Departments in discussion with representatives of the industry.Milk Production.The following figures relate to Great Britain sMillion gallonsLiquid Manufacturing TotalFebruary 1940 66.8 12.0 78.8February 1939 66.1 16.6 82.8January 1940 69.0 11.0 80.0The following relate to the United KingdomLiquid Manufacturing TotalFebruary 1940 68.0 12.7 80.7February 1939 67.4 17.3 84.817.

Urban Swill for Pigs and Poultry.The Salvage Department of the Ministry of Supply in collaboration withthe Agricultural Departments have informed local authorities of the pressing needfor salvaging waste foodstuffs for pigs and poultry and urging them to arrange forits collection.     The County Committees have been asked to get into touch withthe local authorities and assist in the arrangements for disposal.     Someauthorities have already taken the necessary steps and it is hoped that progress will be speeded upaUncultivated or Neglected Land in Scotland.Since the date of the last Report consent to take possession ofagricultural land has been given in three cases.     Agriculttiral Executive committees have been asked to ensure that satisfactory arrangements are made for the utilisation of golf courses for grazing cattle and sheep.     A new defence regulation (No. 63B) has been made giving occupiers of agricultural land extendedrights to burn heather.Animal Health.Since the last Report there have been eight outbreaks of foot andmouth disease involving the slaughter of 1,290 head of stock;, of which 206 headhave been salvaged for human consumption.     The swine fever position has remainedrelatively unchanged,,     Since the last Report 280 outbreaks have been confirmed,,x      Except that the Scottish figures do not include the minor marketing schemes.
