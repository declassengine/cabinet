COAL POSITION.Twelfth Fortnightly Report submitted, hy the Secretary for mines covering the period 16th-29th February, 19*4-0.(Previous Report: Paper No. WP(R.) (hO) 65.)SUPPLIES.The latest information regarding the coal suppliessituation is included in the Report which the Lord privy seal is making to the Cabinet.      It can be summed up by saying that when the additional coal ships and trains begin to arrive in London and the South of England, it is hoped that,given reasonable weather,  it will be possible to avoid further serious trouble, although the house coal position will necessarily remain precarious until the end of March,ITEMPRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT.More favourable weather conditions helped to bring abouta recovery of production, the estimated quantity of saleablecoal raised being 8,659.000 tons for the two weeks ended17th February.      Owing largely to unavoidable absenteeism dueto sickness among workers, the total is 878,000 tons less than for the corresponding period last year.19U01939Week ending 10th Feb.

J
competitive position of the United States producers, led the Mines Department and other Departments concerned to examine the possibility of ensuring the renewal of South Wales anthracite contracts with the Dominion during 1940.

As a result of this move, the Ministry of Shipping has agreed, broadly speaking, to provide 6 - 800,000 tons of shipping for the transport of South Wales anthracite to Canada during the coming exporting season, April-October inclusive. The rate of freight has been fixed a 10/- per ton firm which just enables United Kingdom anthracite to compete with that of the United States in the Canadian market. The collieries have equally agreed to quote a firm price for the season, irrespective of any increase in the general level of coal prices which may be sanctioned. They will, of course, obtain the benefit, if any, of rises in prices made possible by a rise in United States prices, or an appreciation of the dollar.

COLLIERY TIMBER.

The maintenance of the present output of coal depends largely on the provision of the requisite amount of shipping to bring supplies of pitwood and pitprops to this country. The minimum amount of tonnage required from Canada between June and November is 750,000 tons while from the French Bay and Portuguese ports an average of 60,000 and 25,000 tons per month respectively is required.

Owing to lack of shipping from France and Portugal considerable congestion has arisen at the ports and a general slackening off in production in foreshadowed. Great difficulties have been experienced in France in accelerating production and, if the present momentum is retarded, supplies will become short in the summer.
