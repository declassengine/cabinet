INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.1.     Industrial relations generally remain quiet throughout the country.2.     During the month the settlement of wages claims has been reported in anumber of the smaller industries and in oertain districts in industries wherenegotiations are not conducted on a national basis;   in the aggregate the increases affect a considerable number of workpeople.     Apart from the opera-tion of cost of living sliding scale arrangements following the notification of an increase in the cost of living index figure, there have been nofurther increases in any of the principal industries.3.     As a result of the rejection of a claim for a wages &quot;advance, in additionto the increases under the existing cost-of-living scale, the National Unionof Textile Workers gave notice to terminate the agreement in the dyeing andbleaching industry.     This notice will expire on 15th April and the union isat present taking a ballot for strike action if no agreement is reached.The situation is being closely watched.EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPL0Y1IBNT.4.    The regular monthly count taken on 11th March showed a decrease in umemployment,-as compared with 12th Pebruary, amounting to over 582,000.     the test check taken towards the end of Pebruary, when the weather conditions haddefinitely improved, had shown a reduction of 200,000 and the subsequentfurther reduction of 182,000 is encouraging.5.     Conversations have continued with the two sides of the engineering and shipbuilding industries.     Both the Engineering Employers Federation and theAmalgamated Engineering Union have appointed small sub-committees for thepurpose of considering detailed proposals, in collaboration with theMinistry of Labour and National Service, for effecting the redistribution of skilled labour and the introduction of additional labour into the engineeringgroup of industries.     Meetings of these sub-committees have been held, and detailed proposals are now being hammered out.The position in other industries is as follows:-Building Industry.6.     Employment continues to improve and unemployment is now considerablylower than at the same time last year.    All skilled occupations have sharedin this improvement j which has been most marked in the case of bricklayers

where it is due to the adoption of substitute methods of construction to economise in the uso of imported timber and constructional steel.     With thereturn of favourable weather for outdoor work reserves of skilled craftsmenare being rapidly absorbed on the Government building programme and onA.R-P. work.Coal Mining.7.     There has been a wide-spread improvement in employment and a decrease of short-time working during the last month.     This extended to the Northumberlandand Durham coalfields, which had been particularly subject to short-time and temporary cessations of work, the improvement in these fields is largely to be attributed to the special arrangements which have been made for transportingcoal by rail in order to meet the shortage in the South.     In the Yorkshirefields output has been retarded to some extent by spasmodic strikes, bothofficial and unofficial.8.     Shortages of skilled underground workers have been reported in severalareas and numbers of men from the wholly unemployed registers have been re-absorbed.     Some managements are bringing men daily from a distance - one Welshcolliery providing free transport for the purpose.     There may be room forfurther arrangements of this kind to bring in labour from outlying villages.Texti3.es.9.     Employment continues to be very brisk in cotton spinning and weaving and ashortage of certain types of labour persists.     To meet the unsatisfied demand forwomen and juveniles, transference of workers on a fairly large scale has been continued, overtime is being worked in many areas, men are being trained asweavers for night work and married women are being induced to return to the millsfor part-time work.Shipping: Services.10.     Most Divisions have reported that the shortage of deck hands has been somewhat eased and that in general the demands for seamen have been met.     a detailed survey of the numbers available on Exchange registers is shortly to beundertaken.

Agriculture.11.     Improved weather has brought large decreases in unemployment in practically all the Divisions except Wales, where there lias been no appreciable change.     The making up of arrears and the greater acreageto be brought under the plough are expected to cause heavy demands for labour which, it is feared, there will be some difficulty in meeting inmost Divisions.     Both Scotland and North Western Divisions report thatthe majority of the labour now on the Register is of inferior   quality and frequently immobile.     In these and in several other Divisions, ascarcity of skilled workers either has already arisen or is expected soon to arise.     Except in the Midlands, where demands exceed supply, farmersstill seem on the whole to be reluctant to employ members of the Women1 s land Army*TEE CENTRAL REGISTER.12.     Since the outbreak of War 8,534 vacancies have been notified to theCentral Register and 12,051 candidates have been submitted for thesevacancies.     Of this total 4,292 are known to have been appointed whileabout 4,000 candidates are still under consideration.15.     During the month under review, 850 vacancies were notified.     Ofthese 99 were scientific, 247 industrial, 144 professional, 178 administra-tive and 162 fell into miscellaneous categories.     There has been anoticeable increase in the number of scientific and professional vacanciesnotified.14.     On 51st March, the number of offers of service recorded in theCentral Register was 92,021, which includes persons already placed throughthe Register and those still under consideration.

TRAINIKG.15.     On 28th March there were 7,115 civilians in training at government training Centres.     The response to the appeal for recruits shows no signs of abating, and there were on 50th March 3,574 men awaiting alloca-tion to the Centres.     811 men were due to enter training on 4th April.The increase in the number of men on the waiting list is partly due tothe fact that entry to the Centres was suspended during Easter week.Several hundred eqaipped places cannot at present be filled because ofthe difficulty of obtaining instructors.16.     Current expansion programmes which were seriously interfered withby the weather in January and Pebruary are now being pressed forward with all speed, and the erection of Nissen huts should shortly make available further training places.     Arrangements are being made forblacking-out the Centres in preparation for operating a double shift system in the machine shops;   but here again the engagement of theadditional Instructors necessary will constitute a difficult problem.Orders have been placed for equipment which will become necessary as theexpansion programme develops.     The Co-operation of the Ministry of Supplyand of the Air Ministry has been sought in the matter of obtaining machine tools.17.     There are 2,505 training places available for training soldiersto become Army tradesmen, and the number of soldiers in training on28th March was 2,102.     The training of soldiers for the War Officebegan in December and as the training lasts for a period of from four to six months, the first batches of soldiers are just completing their training and will be replaced by fresh drafts.     It is anticipated thatthe War Office will shortly require further training places to be madeavailable, and preliminary arrangements have been made to secure thenecessary accommodation and equipment.

gBCHDTTING,18. Since the date of the last report, two further registrations have heenheld under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act.     That on 9th Marchand 9th March, 1920, both dates inclusive.     The total number of menregistered amounted to 525,500, of whom 5,544 or 1.64 per cent, wereprovisionally registered as conscientious objectors, as compared with1.96 per cent, at the last registration on 17th February.     Of the menregistered in the Military Service Register, 56,706 expressed preference for naval Service and 85,815 for service in the Air Force.19.   Another registration was held on 6th April and related to men not already registered who were born   between 1st January, 1914, and 6th April, 1920,both dates inclusive.The total number of men registered amounted to 514,430, of whom   4,431or 1.41 per cent were provisionally registered as conscientious objectors.This percentage was the lowest for any registration since the outbreak of war. -20.   A further registration will be held on 27th April, and will relate tomen not already registered who were born between 1st January, 1913, and27th April, 1920, both dates inclusive.     The effect of this registrationwill be to register the following new classes -(a) men reaching the age of 20 between. 7th April, 1940 and(b) men who reached the age of 26 during the year 1939.It is estimated that the number of men required to register on this occasionalso will be in the region of 300,000.21.   The most recent figures available show that a total of 548,226 men havebeen medically examined under the Military Training and National Service(Armed Forces) Acts.     The following table indicates the percentage of menplaced in each grade:-?related to men not already registered who were born between 1st January, 1915,27th April, 1940, both dates inclusive;   andGradePercentageIIIA VisionIIA Feet75.54.91.887.5IIIIIIV5.5   )8.04.7

22.   According to the latest returns, the total number of men who havebeen posted to the Forces since the introduction of compulsory recruitingnow stands at 323,310.     This figure is made up of 297,532 for the Army,W17,242 for the Royal Navy, and 8,536 for the Royal Air Force.SCHEDULE OF RESERVED OCCUPATIONS.23.   A number of amendments have been made to the Schedule during themonth in the direction of granting greater reservation to certain keyoccupations in the textile and the textile accessories industries, whichare essential for meeting the needs of the Supply Departments and of theexport trade.24.   Among the more important discussions that have taken place with the ;appropriate associations on the question of the reservation of workers, thefollowing industries may be mentioned:-1. Iron ore and ironstone mining2. Wholesale clothing manufacture3. Chemical industry^4. Hair, bass and fibre manufacture5. Coke oven and by-products.In addition, discussions are proceeding with the Department of Overseas trade on the position of pottery workers employed by firms engaged in export business, and with the National Joint Council for Dock Labour as to theposition of registered and unregistered dock workers.PROVISION FOR THE UNEMPLOYED AMD FOR THE RELIEF OF DISTRESS.25. The number of cases in which allowances were authorised or underconsideration was as follows:-UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE (including supplementary allowances to claimants for unemployment insurance benefit)	1st March 395,000	8th March 581,000	15th March 570,000	22nd March 565,000&apos;	29th March 561,000PREVENTION AND RELIEF OF DISTRESS (i) Evacuated persons (ii) Other cases	2,900 28,100	2,800 26,700	2,600 25,600	2,500 25,200	2, 500 24,700f[T) 26.   Supplementary allowance cases have declined as well as the others, butin a less marked degree.     If such cases are excluded the latest unemployment assistance figure is roughly 345,000.     This is some 51,000 less than at thebeginning of February and 56,000 less than the previous lowest figure sincethe outbreak of war:   it is also the lowest figure since the unemployment assistance scheme started at the beginning of 1935.H.Q. 198-90 D.J.
