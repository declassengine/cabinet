I followed it in early January by an account of the policy we had pursuedand are pursuing, but this, however, dealt with policy alone.In so far as the dissemination of leaflets by air is concerned, the period has,except for two short bursts of activity, been all too quiet. Persistent frost andsnow, with baffling winds from the East, have defied even the daring of the RoyalAii1 Force. It has been all the more disappointing, since the Secretary of Statefor Air had earmarked additional aircraft for our work, and steps had beentaken to increase the efficiency of the service of balloons in France. Under normali iiditions of weather we might indeed have looked for a period of intenseliveliness. As it was, however, fifteen individual leaflets to the total of some&apos;.000,000 copies were scattered over enemy territory, for the most part in theHist and second weeks of January. Restricted distribution has, however, beencompensated to no small extent by the superb and spectacular descents during the flight of the 12th January on Vienna and Prague. On this occasion the raidingaircraft carried leaflets specially addressed to the Austrian and Czech peoples.1 he obvious consternation of the German Propaganda Department as well asreports received from secret sources indicate that these blows were both shrewdand severe.The leaflets distributed during the past two weeks have continued to be oftwo kinds. The first is the single sheet printed in type so large that it can be readit lies upon the ground;  the second, our little four-page paper Wolkigereobachter, of which the seventh number is now about to appear.   Reiterated10877   [20813]Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1940.
reports to the effect that the large-type leaflet embarrasses the Gestapo havewarranted our continuing to use it for general purposes, while the fact that theGermans have copied the style and make-up of the Wolkiger Beobachter for theirown use against France has indicated that it also is on the right lines. Withthe latter we continue to send out a supr)lement, which enables us to treat at thenecessary length of serious themes. The supplement has also other uses.Recently, for &quot;instance, we have filled an issue with excellent photographs ofGerman&apos; cities taken from above by British airmen. I may add that my Depart-ment continues also to produce its fortnightly news-letter in German, and such reports as have reached us in regard to it are favourable.Broadcasting.The hope I expressed in my last report that the number of broadcastprogrammes^ given by the B.B.C. in German would shortly be increased fromfour to seven has not yet materialised. I understand, however, that the remainingdifficulties are those of obtaining staff with the necessary high qualifications&quot;,and of satisfying the Treasury in regard to the financial implications. I cannot,however, stress too strongly the importance of developing a form of propaganda which is producing results of unquestionable value. Even seven broadcasts aday would be less than the flood of propaganda in English which pours from german stations. If the additional times are instituted we intend to begin by using them for news bulletins only, and then by degrees to introduce specialtalks for the benefit of those classes of Germans likely to be listening at each particular time. Thus at mid-morning, housewives, and during the post-prandial rest, business men will receive special attention. There is already anearly morning broadcast, and arrangements are now in progress for talks to workers at this time. In this the T.U.C. have offered to co-operate by procuringEnglish Trade Unionists who will address themselves to Germans in similaremployments to their own. It is possible also that some neutral and (if weare satisfied in regard to their individual suitability) some German refugee trade unionists will also be included1.For a considerable time I had urged upon the B.B.C. the desirability of appointing a special commentator to talk two or three times a week to Germany.My ideal is a man of personality who would convey a sense of his own trust-worthiness and common sense even to enemy audiences. Broadcastingpersonalities, and especially those who have good German, are, however, fewand far betAveen. The hunt, I am glad to say, seems to have ended! in the discovery of the necessary qualifications in Professor Lindley Fraser, of AberdeenUniversity. The B.B.C. have already found him an excellent broadcaster,particularly on theoretic economics, but he appears also to have wider gifts,and in his trial efforts has registered a good beginning. Economists are, more-over, of value. Of recent weeks, for instance, we have pursued! a deliberateattempt to play in the German broadcasts upon the widespread fear of inflationwhich exists in Germany. As in all our efforts we have been governed by thenecessity of keeping well within the limits of demonstrable truth. It has, never-theless, been possible for us to show that, while actual monetary inflation is stillonly a danger, concealed inflation of a pernicious kind already exists.Regular news broadcasting continues in Czech and Polish, and, in addition,there are three weekly talks in each language. In the case of both languages, one is a military survey, one a diplomatic view, and the third a review of the week&apos;snews. In addition, two further weekly talks are planned for Czech and Slovaklisteners.Results of Propaganda.On the 27th January the British press contained significant evidence of theeffect of our leaflet and broadcasting propaganda on, at any rate, the GermanGovernment, In the first place it announced that those Germans or neutrals inGermany who pass on our leaflets were liable to be shot, and that the penalties for picking up or keeping them would be more vigorously applied. The reasonalleged was the large number of cases before the Courts. In the second, it was reported that a broadcast warning had been given on all German transmittersduring the previous night reminding that the existing penalties of death or penal servitude would be ruthlessly imposed for listening to foreign wireless stations.
Neutrals, it was added, would in this matter be subject to the same laws asnationals. It seems improbable that even the German Government would haveconfessed its embarrassment so openly and carried unpopular prohibitions to suchlengths, unless it had serious reason for alarm. I am not yet in the position toreport to what extent these attempts to defeat foreign propaganda have proved a deterrent; but naturally I have sought to be informed.A few days later a secret report from a Berlin source informed us that the.,Gestapo hate leaflets. If a German is found listening in to foreign broadcastsconviction is comparatively easy. It is, however, more difficult to prove that&quot; aman who finds and reads a piece of printed paper on the ground is committinga deliberate crime. Certain cases at the beginning of the war had, moreover,greatly worried the Gestapo. Leaflets dropped in Northern or Western germany had been discovered in sheltered mountain spots in the Tyrol and Bavaria. In one case a leaflet was found pinned to a tree. A well-trodclen path off a main roadproved that a number of people had made a special journey to read it. TheGerman Ministry of Propaganda, the report goes on, consider leaflets as a dangerous addition to broadcast propaganda, since Germans are now satiated bythe &quot;endless stream of their own wireless. The fact that their own PropagandaMinistry is employing leaflets in enemy and neutral countries demonstrates, itsuggests, a belief in the effectiveness of this form of publicity. Confirmation ofthe German Governments fear of our leaflets and of its inability to prevent their being read is also to be found in the angry denunciation of them published inthe Volkischer Beobachter (North German edition) of the 31st January. Anotherrecent report from within Germany states that the great majority of Germanslisten in to Paris and London. They have even formed listening-in clubs, whichmeet each evening in a different house. &quot; Did you have the Paris (or London)dream last night?&quot; is quite a common question, and few people, it adds, arecaught listening in. Yet another from the British Minister in Bucharest statesthat he has learned from a Roumanian who claims to know Germany well, and hasbeen in touch with recent German arrivals, that B.B.C. broadcasts are widely known and carry conviction; French broadcasts are less successful, as too obviouslyoji the propaganda note. Reproductions of Hitler&apos;s speeches (they are a constantfeature of our broadcasts in German) have a tremendous effect. An excellentreport has also been received to the effect that the London broadcasts in Polishare being listened to widely in that country, including the part occupied by the soviets. Indeed, Russian soldiers, officers and officials in this area exhibitconsiderable curiosity in regard to the London news. A similarly good report has been received in regard to the broadcasts in Czech, which are listened tdwidely.Relations with France. :\My office in Paris continues to send me cheerful reports of the goodwill whichcharacterises all their relations with the French. Recent collaboration in regardto the leaflet embodying a joint statement by Mr. Chamberlain and M. Daladier,to which I alluded in my last report, has, I understand, given considerable satis-f action to the French, and I have every hope that it will have opened paths tofurther common action.Front Line Propaganda.My second major interest in France is the arrangements for front-line propa-ganda at such time as our military authorities there desire it to begin. I haverecently reached a most satisfactory agreement with the Director of military intelligence at G.H.Q. in regard to our respective spheres of responsibility. It isbriefly that both the policy and production of front-line propaganda are the concern of my Department, while the machinery of dissemination, in so far as itis under the control of the Director of Military Intelligence, is his. We have,lowever, agreed that, in the event of propaganda matter being required withgreat urgency, he shall be empowered to prepare it within the limits of agreed policy, and, after submission to a representative of mine in Paris, to produce it.i nis arrangement will in no way conflict with that by virtue of which the RoyallorCe disseminates leaflets by the agencies of distribution under its control ropaganda directed towards the German lines seems likely to produce^ eater results than appeared possible when we first considered its problems.  A
report emanating from the French Secret Service, which I received a few daysago, states the French are delighted with the results of loud-speakers by whichthey projected first music and then talks across the Rhine. On a still night theywere clearly audible at three kilometres. At the second trial, the German troops were seen to run out in great numbers, evidently eager to listen. They were followed by their officers, who roughly ordered them back, and then shOuts of&quot; shut up &quot; were raised. Later shots were directed towards the sound. Germancommuniques subsequently referred to the transmissions and claimed, quiteuntruly to have silenced them. The French idea was, it appears, deliberately totaunt the enemy; it would be interesting to test the effect of less provocative formsof propaganda,. Incidentally, the report adds that Hitler&apos;s reputation with theGerman troops ca,n no longer be considered unassailable, as it was when the warbegan. It has been notably affected by the Graf Spee incident, and it is now plain that his idea of military honour is not that of the Reichswehr.Co-operation tvith the Fighting Forces.Since my last report my consultative committee, which comprises the directors of Naval and Military Intelligence, the Royal Air Force, the ForeignOffice and the Ministry of Information, has held three meetings. I have nowadded to it by arranging for the Ministry of Economic Warfare to be represented.The Committee is also greatly aided by the attendance of General Ismay and colonel Hollis of the War Cabinet Secretariat. The Committee continues not.only to prove most helpful to my work, but also associates with it all the Depart-ments most interested in external propaganda. It thus acts valuably as a clearinghouse for suggestions, and provides a convenient channel for interchanges ofinformation.Refugees.The arrangement mentioned in my last 1&apos;eport by virtue of which I takeadvantage of such useful information and advice as is obtainable from the refugeegroups in this country continues satisfactorily. A certain amount of freshintelligence which it is able to employ usefully reaches my Department, and ithas access to the more valuable records in refugee hands. I have, moreover,recently instituted a system under which certain German refugees listen regularlyto the B.B.C. broadcasts in German and furnish reports upon them. I feel that,in this way, the difficulties of employing refugees without embarrassment or theexercise of undue influence on their part have been overcome.Relations with the Press.On the 3rd January I held a meeting of the private Committee of newspaper proprietors, to which former reports of mine have alluded. I made a general statement on the activities of my Department, and am satisfied that it met with full approval. Indeed, the only difficulty which has arisen recently is anoccasional, though, it would seem, diminishing, restlessness at the deprecationby the Censorship of the publication of the texts of leaflets. I have found,however, that, when the full reasons for it have been confidentially explainedsome cannot well be published), their validity has been accepted, and I have nodoubt, that a letter on the subject addressed recently to the newspapers by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs has had good results.I need scarcely say that I regard prohibition in this respect as an increasinglyvaluable protection against potential exploitation in Germany by the german propaganda Ministry of alleged differences of opinion in this country, and of interested neutral criticism of our products. I understood, moreover, that thisview is shared to the full by my colleagues in France.
