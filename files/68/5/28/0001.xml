2i7INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.1.     During the month under review settlements on wages questions, allproviding for substantial increases, have been reached in several of the mostimportant industries in the country.     These include engineering, shipbuilding,flour milling and the railways.     In addition, in a number of industries inwhich wages are calculated on cost-of-living sliding scales, rates have been increased, in accordance with the provisions of those scales.     In generalthe machinery of negotiation in industry continues to function without- difficulty.2.     The Road Haulage Central Wages Board at a meeting on 8th February decidedto set the statutory machinery of the Road Haulage Wages Act in operation witha view to increases of 5/-, 4/- or 3/- a week (according to area) being madein the existing statutorjr rates of wages for road haulage workers.     At thesame time, the Board resolved that the employers&apos; organisations be requested torecommend their members to bring these increases into operation forthwithwithout waiting for the statutory machinery to function.     Action outside theBoard by the Unions in support of this resolution led to a number of disputes and in Bristol to the issue of strike notices.     The position seemed likely todevelop unfavourably and the Emergency Committee of the Board was called together to deal with it.     It now seems likely that the matter will be cleared up without undue trouble.3.     The Trade Boards and Road Haulage Wages (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1940,received the Royal Assent on 21st February.     The object of this Act is togive the Minister of Labour and National Service power to make regulations to speed up and simplify the machinery for the statutory regulation of minimum rates of wages in the industries to which the Trade Boards Acts have been applied and in the road haulage industry.4.     In pursuance of these powers, regulations were made on 23rd February, the broad effect of which is to enable variations of minimum rates to become effective in about a month from the inception of a proposal to make such a variation instead of from three to four months as in the past.EMPLOYJdSNT AND UMMPLOYKtENT.5.     The normal count of unemployed persons taken on 12th February showed adecrease of only 14,796 as compared with 15th January.     It seemed clear thatthe effect of the adverse weather conditions still persisted on 12th February

and in order to confirm this opinion a special test check of the Registerwas made on 26th Pebruary.     This provided information which enabled theDepartment to estimate with confidence that there had &quot;been a further reduction in the neighbourhood of 200,000.6.     Whilst the weather conditions of January and Pebruary have been exeptional and have caused a large amount of temporary unemployment, it must be noted thata contributory factor of some importance in the engineering, shipbuilding and aircraft industries is the shortage of materials.     In the discussions on labourproblems which have been taking place with the engineering and shipbuilding industries, both Employers and Trade Unions have called special attention to this factor.7.     It is satisfactory to be able to report that the discussions with Employersand Trade Unions, referred to above, are proceeding very satisfactorily.     Bothsides have given a clear indication of their desire to be helpful.The following notes relate to the position in individual industries.Coal Mining.8.     The abnormal weather in the earlier part of the month and the consequenttransport difficulties naturally caused a heavy increase in temporary stoppages.Many pits were unable to get waggons in or out and stocks accumulated at thepit heads.     In some areas men were unable to get to the collieries for several days.     The special steps taken to move the coal as soon as the weather improvedameliorated the position and by the middle of the month most areas werereturning to normal working.     The demands for industrial and domestic coal are particularly heavy since stocks have been reduced all over the country andcollieries in this trade are sure of full time work.     In the Northern Divisionshipping delays have continued to affect the output of export coal.     The WelshCollieries have now practically recovered the favourable position reached inJanuary and all the collieries, except a few in the Rhondda Valley, are back to full time.Textiles.9.     In the early part of the month shortages of fuel and raw material causedby the transport difficulties during the frost resulted in temporary stoppagesin several branches of the cotton industry, but the position is now rightingitself.     Boom conditions continue in the woollen industry and manufacture for

export is said to be improving.     Several instances are reported of firmsdeclining orders because of the restrictions on supplies available for home demand.     The shortage of skilled operatives especially for night work ispronounced, and firms are endeavouring to meet their difficulties by overtime,importation of labour, some dilution, and relaxation of restrictions imposed by the Factory Acts.10.     Hosiery firms who have received Government orders are exceptionallybusy but others are having to refuse civilian orders through lack of wool andsome short time working has resulted through depletion of stocks.Clothing.11.     The wholesale trade is active and the retail bespoke branch has improved,owing to anticipated Spring and Summer requirements.     Some difficulty inobtaining materials is reported and there is said to be a shortage of buttonsand trimmings.   The boot and shoe industry continues to be busy.Fishing; Industry.12.     Unfavourable weather conditions inevitably affected the industry andemployment in the East Coast Ports remained poor.     Only two boats are fishingat Lowestoft, while the return of requisitioned trawlers to Grimsby has not materially affected the position in that port.     On the West Coast, Fleetwoodhas been exceptionally busy, although 52 fewer trawlers use the port than atthe outbreak of hostilities.     A number of trawlers from East Coast Ports are,however, now putting in at Fleetwood and the Icelandic trawlers are also landingtheir catches there.   There has been an improvement in Scotland following thecommencement of the salmon fishing season.     There has also been some increasein the numbers engaged in herring fishing on the West Coast and in the firth of Forth area.     For the most part trawlers are having to operate on theWest Coast but catches have been fairly good and prices high.     The loss of continental markets is seriously affecting the curing branch of the industry.Shipping Service.13.     Difficulties continue to be experienced in meeting the demands forseamen and engine room ratings.     The position is being carefully examined andanalysed in order to obtain full information as to the numbers of men available and the possible sources of further recruitment for the Mercantile Marine.

Port Labour.14.     Unemployment in the port transport industry lias remained at a low level, the total number of dock workers registered in the third, week ofPebruary being in the region of 21,000.     Employment is particularlygood in Manchester, Bristol, Glasgow and. Liverpool.     London has maintaineda good, average level and its number of registered unemployed has remainedaround 5,000.Engineering; and Allied Industries.15.     In the engineering industry the labour shortage which lias been referred to in previous reports has continued.     There are, however,encouraging signs that employers are making efforts to solve their difficulties.     The standards of skill on which they previously insistedare being relaxed, men from Government Training Centres are being engaged,complicated skilled processes are being broken down into their simplecomponent operations which can be learnt within a fairly short time, and theemployers&apos; own training facilities are being extended.     In addition, casesof dilution under the Relaxation of Custom Agreement, some of them involvingsubstantial numbers of workpeople, are becoming more frequent.Shipbuilding Industry.16.     The shortage of skilled workers has continued in the shipbuilding industry.     Private firms, however, have made some progress in dilutionunder local arrangements with the Unions concerned, and Government establish-ments are taking steps to ease the shortage by retaining employees afterthe normal age of retirement.Agriculture.17.     In most areas the employment position has continued to deteriorate  .mainly on account of bad weather.     Worth Western is the only division which reports a slight improvement.     There are serious arrears of work andit is expected that there will be unusually heavy demands for labour toovertake them as the weather improves.     Most of the demands can probablybe met from existing labour supplies, but Scotland and Southern Divisionsparticularly report that there may be difficulty in obtaining sufficientexperienced workers, and there are still many reports of farm labourers

being attracted to industrial employment.     Some shortages of particulartypes of skilled workers have already arisen.     In Hampshire a scheme isbeing considered for setting up a pool of threshing-machine drivers togo from farm to farm.     South Western Division reports that tractordrivers are difficult to obtain on account of the low wages offered.18.     In Midlands Division the demand for members of the Women&apos;s land army is greater than the supply and it has been necessary to obtain them from other areas.     Elsewhere farmers still seem disinclined to use this organisation.Building Industry.19.     As was to be expected there has been a substantial improvement inemployment in the building industry with the advent of more favourable weather conditions for outdoor work.     The total number of workers (aged 18-64)unemployed at 19th Pebruary, the latest date for which information is available,was 158,297J    this was nearly 24,000 less than at 22nd January.     The numberof skilled men (excluding painters) wholly unemployed was 54,568;    8,186 lessthan at 22nd January.     All the skilled occupations have shared in this reduction in unemployment.20.     The total unemployed in the industry at 19th Pebruary also shows areduction of 19,437 as compared with Pebruary 1959 but this reduction wasamong unskilled men, over 14,000 more skilled men being unemployed than ayear ago.21.     Skilled men are being released from civil building and A.R.P. workbut they are also being absorbed on the Government building programme andon the construction of extensions to factories producing for war purposes.As these demands are concentrated mainly in the West of England a considerabletransfer of workers is involved.     Several thousand building trade workers have already been imported into the Salisbury Plain area and new demandsare likely to arise there.     The National Joint Council of the BuildingIndustry has scheduled five of the contracts in this area, thus bringing them within the provisions of the new agreement applicable to certain war-time jobs requiring an unusual degree of organisation of accommodation.

THE CENTRAL REGISTER.22.     Since the outbreak of war 7,828 vacancies have been notified to theCentral Register and 9,578 candidates have been submitted in connection withthese vacancies.     Of this total, 3,795 candidates are known to have beenappointed, while about 3,000 candidates are still under consideration.     a recent feature has been the increase in the number of administrative andqaiasi-administrative vacancies.23.     During the month, 815 vacancies were notified.      Of these, 31 werescientific, 182 industrial, 84 professional, 243 administrative,  and 275 fellinto miscellaneous categories.24.     On 29th Pebruary the number of offers of service recorded on theCentral Register was 90,743, which includes persons already placed throughthe Register and those still under consideration.TRAINING.25.     There continues to be a good response to the intensive recruitmentcampaign to fill the Government Training Centres.     Following upon mybroadcast talk, arrangements were made for newspaper correspondents to visit the Leicester Centre on 19th February, and the Training Scheme receivedwide publicity in the Press as a result of this visit.     1,300 men were dueto enter training on 29th February, and there still remained a waiting listof 1,325.26.     The number of soldiers in training had risen by 22nd February to 2,309.RECRUITING.  &quot;27*     On Saturday, 17th February, a further registration was held under theNational Service (Armed Forces) Act.     It related to men not alreadyregistered who, on 31st December, 1939, had reached the age of 20 but notthe age of 24.     The machinery of registration worked according to plan andthe provisional figures show that a total of 257,802 men were registered.Of the men registered in the Military Service Register, 41,332 expressed a preference for Naval Service and 67, 758 for service in the Air Force.     Thenumber of men provisionally registered as conscientious objectors was 5,114representing 1.98 per cent of the total registered.     This was 0.12 per cent,less than for the last registration on 9th December, 1939.

28.     Owing to the increased demands of the War Office for March and april and the larger number of men in the 23 age group who will be reserved bythe Schedule of Reserved Occupations,  a further registration has been fixed for 9th March.     On this occasion men not already registered who were bornbetween 1st January, 1915, and 9th March, 1920, will be required to register.Having regard to the classes of men already registered, the registration on 9th March will in the main relate to:(a) men reaching the age of 20 between 1st January, 1940 and March, 1940, both dates inclusive, and(b) men who reached the age of 24 during the year 1939.It is estimated that the number of men required to register will be in the region of 300,000.29.     It has now been ascertained that of the 693,482 men registered in theMilitary Service Register at 12th Pebruary, 1940, 124,730 were reserved bythe Schedule of Reserved Occupations, and over 23,000 others had had theircalling up deferred at the request of contracting Departments on whoseurgent contracts they were employed.30.     The most recent figures show that a total of 488,347 men have beenmedically examined under the Military Training and National Service (armed forces) Acts.     The following table indicates the percentage of men placed ineach grade:Grade PercentageI 76.3^HA (Vision) 4.9) 88.0        cent.IIA (Feet) 1.7)II 5.1)III 7.6IV 4.431.     During the month 39,073 men were posted under the National Service(Armed Forces) Act for service with the Army, making a total of approximately267,000 since the introduction of compulsory recruiting to the Forces.The comparable totals for the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force are now &apos;16, 728   and 6,243 respectively.

SCHEDULE OB&apos; RESERVED OCCUPATIONS.32.     During the month it has been found desirable to lower the age ofreservation in certain occupations in (l) chain making, (2) bolt, nut andrivet manufacture,  and (3) Admiralty Chart Production;    and in order toensure a supply of plywood for aircraft manufacture, reservation has beenafforded to certain classes of workers in the veneer and plywood trades,not previously reserved,33.     As a result of the conclusions reached by an Inter-DepartmentalCommittee on the supply of scientific instrument makers and assemblers tothe Forces, it has been decided to appeal to Universities, technical colleges and Technical Schools and to amateurs, for men with suitablequalifications to volunteer for service in the Forces as instrumenttradesmen.     Additions have also been made to the list of civilianoccupations from which such tradesmen may be recruited.34.     A document combining the Schedule of Reserved Occupations and the list of Service Trades has been issued to Local Offices of the ministry and this will greatly facilitate the correct posting of tradesmen.55.     Deputations urging variations in the present ages of reservation of various occupations have been received, of which the most important were from the following industries:-1. Paper making2. General waste reclamation3. Printing4. Film production and exhibition5. Glove manufacture6. Leather tanning, currying and dressing7. Carbon goods manufacture.As a result of discussions with these industries amendments to the Scheduleare being considered.36.     In order to give the coal distributive trade an opportunity of getting over its present exceptional difficulties, arrangements have been,made, in consultation with the Mines Department, under which specifiedmen employed by coal merchants, whose immediate withdrawal from their employment would give rise to difficulty in the delivery of coal, will notbe called up under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act until themiddle of April at the earliest.

39. The number of cases in which allowances had been granted or were underconsideration was as follows:-	2nd February	9,th February	16th February	23rd FebruaryIMBMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE (including supplementary allowances to claimants for unemployment  insurance benefit)	416,000	411,000	406,000	400,O00PREVENTION AND BELIEF OF DISTRESS (i) Evacuated persons (ii) Other cases	3,400 29,000	3,200 28,400	3,100 28,500	3,000 28,90040. .   The number of unemployment assistance allowances on 2nd February was substantially higher than at any time during the period from the outbreak ofwar to the end of 1939, following an increase starting at the end ofDecember.     The number of allowances exclusive of supplementary allowances to persons on unemployment insurance benefit, however, did not increase to any appreciable extent by comparison with the last three months of 1939*     On37.     It has been considered desirable in the national interest to maintain and develop missionary activities abroad and it has accordingly beenagreed that Lay Missionaries home on furlough from abroad should be allowedto return to the mission field and not be called up for military service andthat candidates who were accepted, before the war, by an authorisedMissionary Society for religious work as missionaries abroad should be reserved by an entry in the Schedule of Reserved Occupations.38.     Section 11(1)(e) of the National Service (Armed Forces) Act, 1939,which exempts from liability to be called up for service a man in holy ordersor a regular minister of any religious denomination, does not cover allfull-time religious workers,  and it has been agreed that in fiarness anentry in the Schedule of Reserved Occupations should be made as follows:-&quot;Men who though not within the scope of Section ll(l)(e) of theNational Service (Armed Forces) Act, 1939, have been,  since before september, 1939, engaged whole-time upon religious work for somerecognised religious body and continue in this work withoutinterruption.&quot;PROVISION FOR THE UNEMPLOYED AND FOR RELIEF OF DISTRESS.

H.Q.217-90 C.J.2nd February it was only 3,000 more than at the beginning of october and only a few hundreds more than the highest figure during thosethree months:    by the end of February it had fallen by 17,000 and was less than at any time since the outbreak of war.     Supplementary allowances,on the other hand, have increased steadily from under 7,000 early inOctober to 22,000 on 2nd February and over 23,000 on 23rd February.     this increase may largely be explained by the fact that winter additions havebeen made under the Unemployment Assistance Regulations in appropriate cases from the end of October onwards, and by the increase in unemployment assistance scale rates made by the Amendment Regulations in December.It was to be expected, therefore, that a greater number of unemploymentinsurance benefit claimants could be considered in need of supplementary allowances from the Board.41.     The Board&apos;s local officers took the leading part in thearrangements for the care of the men released from the &quot;Altmark&quot; who were landed at Leith on 17th February.     Their special task was to obtainclothing for those of the men who needed it and to make arrangements for those who were fit and anxious to do so to return to their families inother parts of the country.     Their work has been specially commended bythe Regional Commissioner for Scotland.(Intd.) E.B.
