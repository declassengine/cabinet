Enemy aircraft dropped bombs on the Shetland IslandsIon the 24th and 29th January but no damage was done.    Thereiras considerable enemy activity off the North-East coastjetween the 29th January and the 3rd February and air raidearnings were sounded in a number of places on the 29th January.fOne enemy aircraft was brought down on the 3rd February nearlitby.iir Raid Precautions ServicestThe issue of personal protective equipment for A.R.P.ersonnel has now reached the final stage, and in many directionsthe completion of the programme is already in sight.    By the endlot March it is anticipated that the full quantity of steel helmetslittle over two-thirds of the requirements of Service respirators,he full requirements of Civilian Duty respirators, and sufficientupplies of protective clothing will have been delivered.The distribution of the baby&apos;s helmet to the whole country is now practically complete, and the same is true of thefirst essential distribution of the children&apos;s respirator -that is to say, to children up to three years of age.4. A full-time officer who is an expert in cateringSpatters has been appointed to investigate the organisation ofmessing facilities for A.R.P. personnel, beginning with the   -London Region.    It is hoped that considerable economies andHalso greater efficiency will be secured.JLighting Restrictions.5. The work of the Inter-Departmental Committee onLighting in Industrial Establishments is continuing, and agreement has been reached with representatives of the shipbuilders on thehecessary standards of lighting in shipbuilding and shiprepairmgyards.IpCasualty  S^r-in^making?* During the fortnight the number of vacant beds inI     England and Wales has dropped by a further 8,000, the total on
4th February being approximately 122,000.    The number of Servicesick occupying casualty beds has risen to nearly 17,000,showing an increase of 6,000 during the fortnight.    Convoysof military sick are now being received from France twicea week.7. In Scotland the.number of casualty beds available on the 4th February was approximately 10,700 - a.decreaseof 400 over the fortnight.    Actually 700 fewer beds wereavailable in existing hospitals, but 300 -beds in. new huttedannexes came into service during the period.     About 1,200casualty beds are occuped by Service sick.&apos;8. By interim arrangement with the Service Departmentsnearly 400 cases of serving soldiers, etc., chiefly cases of sickness, are being treated in Ministry of Pensions Hospitals.9. As the Central Emergency Committee for the NursingProfession have completed the initial organisation of theCivil Nursing Reserve,  the Committees executive functionshave now been transferred to the Ministry of Health, and theCommittee itself is being replaced by an Advisory Councilof nursing and employing organisations, with Miss Horsbrugh,Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry,  as Chairman.    Thelocal Emergency Committees remain unaffected by these changes and their work will now be further assisted and -stimulated by the appointment of Regional Nursing Officers on the staffof the Hospital Officers.10. The latest figures received from local authoritiesshow that at&apos;3lst December, 22,000 trained and assistant,nurses and 26,000 trained nursing auxiliaries were registeredwith the Reserve in England and Wales.

The Ministry&apos;s Optical Appliances Depot forthe manufacture and supply of artificial eyes and spectacleshas been extended for the same reason and already the outputof spectacles,  8000 per annum under peace-time conditions,has reached nearly 8,000 per month, and is increasing, by reasonof the demands of the Service Departments for   soecial spec-tacles; for wea-r.-..witt.h gas mask.
gva cnation?15, The remaining returns now received from localauthorities confirm in general the figures given in the lastreport&quot;1&quot; as to the return of evacuated persons to the evacuationareas.      The complete returns show that in England and Wales,out of 4-35,000 mothers and young children,  379,000 or 87 percent, have returned, and out of 735,000 school children520,000,  or 4-4 per cent, have returned.16.

Ministers held a conference with representatives ofthe English and Scottish local government associations and educational bodies on January 22nd and discussed with them theproposals for evacuation of unaccompanied school children inthe event of air raids on land objectives.    A general measureof agreement was obtained.      The plans have been considered in further detail and a number of points remitted to the english and Scottish Advisory Committees.on the evacuation of school-children, which met on February 1st and 2nd respectively.      Itis proposed that a public announcement should be made andcirculars issued to local,authorities on February 15th,Public Order.18, There is little to add to previous reports aboutsubversive activities.    Both the Fascists and the Communistsappear to be concentrating -on Manchester.    Three Fascistinterrupters were ejected from the meeting addressed byivir.  Churchill on the 27th January, which was otherwiseenthusiastic.    On the following day the Communists held amass meeting which was addressed by Harry Pollitt, and whichwas packed, and on Sunday the 4th February, Sir Oswald Mosleyheld a mass meeting at the Free Trade Hall and there was anotherCommunist meeting.      Elsewhere neither Fascist nor Communistactivity has been out of the ordinary.a civil Defence Report No.  9,  paragraph 14.&quot;h iJivil Defence Report No.  11, paragraphs 15 and 16Emergency Health Measures.13. Reference was made in a previous report   to theincrease in the incidence of venereal disease owing towar conditions.     A circular has now &quot;been issued to localauthorities emphasising the importance of maintaining, and where necessary extending, the arrangements for treatment.14, A central Council, with Lord Rosebery as Chairman,has been set up in Scotland to co-ordinate existing bloodtransfusion services, conduct propaganda, organise thecollection of voluntary contributions, and serve as the channelfor the distribution of Exchequer assistance.
Railways,19, During the period under review severe weather con-ditions,  accompanied by heavy downfalls of snow,  spread tomost parts of the country, with the result that congestionupon the railways continued to he acute.    Shortages of domestic coal were reported at many - places throughout thecountry.      In some parts public Utility and industrial undertakings were also in difficulties owing to shortsupplies of coal.20, Consultations took place between the Ministry ofTransport, the Mines Department and the Railway ExecutiveCommittee, and an emergency programme was put into operationunder which suitable coal was requisitioned by the MinesDepartment and drawn in full train loads from the nearestrailway sidings or marshalling yards, irrespective or originallabelling instructions,  and sent to points most in need.    Some30 train loads were delivered in this way.    In addition some20 train loads were despatched direct from the collieries.Docks and Harbours.21. The operations of the ports generally, andparticularly on the North-West and North-Sast Coastshave been seriously hampered by the severe weather con-ditions.    There have been relatively few cases of vesselsbeing actually held up, but the dislocation of inland transport services has prevented goods moving freely fromthe ports.Road Transport.22. The operation of both goods and passenger road transport has also been considerably hampered by the weather.In consequence there was a reduction in the issues of petrolz&apos;ations, but it is likely that in order to deal with arrears of work the next period will show an increase above normal.Special arrangements were made for making additional petrolavailable for local distribution of coal.J.
