Thirteenth Fortnightlythe secretary covering the periodReport submitted &quot;byfor Mines1st to 14th March.COAL POSITION&quot;.Supplies.The general shortage of coal continues.      It is true thatthe extension of priority for all coal traffic on therailways has helped to expedite deliveries and the specialweekly programme for London and the Southern Counties of46 train-loads of coal for household purposes and 97 train-loadsfor electricity undertakings has eased the position in some ofthe most hard-pressed areas.     Nevertheless,  supplies to house-coal depots   remain,   of necessity, on a hand-to-mouthbasis, while the reserves of the Public Utility Undertakingsare below the safety level.Production is slowly recovering from the effects of therecent dislocation, and as pits are now generally working fulltime the best means of securing increased production is againunder consideration.Among the temporary factors affecting production havebeen strikes in the South and West Yorkshire coalfieldsinvolving intermittently between 15,000 and 18,000 mineworkers.Negotations have been taking place between the representative bodies in this area of the Mining Association and the Mineworkers&apos;Federation with a view to the settlement of outstandingdifferences, which are concerned with wages.

Pro du c t i o n a n d &amp; rap 1 o yme n t.Production has again been affected by absenteeism due mainly to sickness among workers.      The estimated quantity of saleablecoal raised for the week ended 2nd March was only 50,000 tonshigher at 4,526,000 tons than for the previous week.      The total for the two weeks showed at 9,002,000 tons an advance of34-5 , 000 tons on the previous fortnight, but was 507,000 tons lessthan for  the corresponding fortnight a year ago.ITEM	1940			1939	Week ending 24th Feb.
