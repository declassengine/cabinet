OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)No.C R E T.,    (r)  (hi) 27.h April 1941...WAR CABINET.Economic Warfare.I attach, for the information of my colleagues, aef report for the month of March,  1941.H.D.h April, 19U1.

ECONOMIC WARFARE DURING MARCH,  19ULThe central features of the economic war last month have&quot;been pressure from the French, accompanied by threats and boasts,to increase their sea-borne supplies,    much discussion between ourselves and the U.S.  Government on the correct policy to adopt towards this pressure     and the focussing of public opinion, both here and in the U.S.A., on the subject of the blockade of France,In other sectors changes have been slight.      Progress towardsadequate co-operation from the U.3.A.,  continues slowly.      We haveincreased our control over shipping and financial contraband.FRANCE AND FRENCH NORTH AFRICA.Early in the month the U.S. Government, who had alreadybeen negotiating independently with the French regarding supplies to French North Africa, urged His Majesty&apos;s Government to considerallowing shipments of wheat for unoccupied France.     His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were becoming increasingly concerned at the infiltrationof Germans into French North Africa, and at the continuing leakin the blockade through the Straits and a-eo^fc^t-e the Mediterranean.Faced with the U.S. demand, we felt the need of bold action, and invited the U.S. Government to offer   limited supplies for north africa and wheat for Unoccupied France in return for the stoppingof German infiltration and the establishment,  though the presenceof British and American observers, of adequate controls.     TheU.S. Government were not willing to adopt this suggestion in toto,hut they agreed to discuss the problem with Vichy.     At the sametime they proposed to send two cargoes of flour to unoccupied france without conditions.     Though dissatisfied with this policy,we agreed to grant navicerts.Meanwhile, Admiral Darlan announced that the FrenchMerchant Fleet was organised to bring food to France, and the news of the &quot;French leak&quot; in the blockade was clearly brought to the^notice of public opinion in Britain, which reacted strongly against it.     When, later, Vichy announced a barter agreement withthe Reich for   the exchange of food stuffs from the unoccupiedzone for wheat, U.S.  opinion also notably hardened.     At the end ofthe month, the U.S. Government seemed disposed to drop further proposals to feed unoccupied France;    to pursue negotiationsregarding French North Africa in collaboration with us;    and to insist on political concessions, especially the stopping ofGerman infiltration and facilities for U.S.  observers, as conditionsof any agreement.      The two promised cargoes of flour have not yetsailed, but will probably do so in the very near future.French sailings through Gibraltar were much the same as for January and February.      At the end of the month an unsuccess-ful attempt was made to intercept a convoy of four ships whichentered Nemours.MIDDLE EAST.Favourable negotiations with the Turks may lead to anarrangement virtually equivalent to a War Trade Agreement.Pre-emption operations are in progress in Turkey, Iran and afghanistan; they are limited largely by the difficulty of supply-In g what is wanted in exchange.    Our policy towards Syria wasrelaxed so as to provide outlets alternative to Germany for SyrianProducts.
THE FAR BAST.German plans for securing 30,000 tons of rubber fr0Indo-China and Thailand via the Trans-Siberian railway look 1succeeding, under Japanese pressure, whilst the Philippines abecoming an ever-widening gap in the Pacific blockade.Some progress has been made in reducing Japan&apos;s oil supplies by the progressive withdrawal of non-Japanese tankerfrom the Pacific trade. Further advance has been made in agreeing with N.E.I. quotas for exports to Japan, and N.E.I.confirmed their adherence to the policy of prohibiting exporof all their principal raw materials to the U.S.S.R. To obtaadequate control of Pacific trade, however, much greater co-operation from the II.S.A.  is indispensable.U.S.A.Negotiations with the U.S-Government moved faster tin recent months and more rapid progress may be hoped for infuture, following the passing of the Lend-and-Lease Bill andappointment of Professor Noel Hall to Washington.      The lackany body or co-ordinating office in the U.8.A. capable of deawith all economic warfare matters is still a major handicap.Little progress has been made in controlling dangerexports from South American countries by means of exportlicensing at source, nor has any adequate co-operation yet beestablished in co-ordinating with the U.S.A. pre-emptive andother purchases in South America.     There have, however, beennumber of welcome additions to the U.S. Export Licence List.The U.S. Government has arrested all enemy ships un&quot;the Espionage Act, and action of varying efficiency has beentaken in certain Central and South American countries toimmobilise or take over such ships. This has been the signalfor several ships to leave port; others have been sabotaged.The task of immobilising and, if possible, getting control of arefugee shipping in the Americas is thus entering on an activephase.CONTROL OF SHIPPING.The undertaking required of shipowners under the warrant Scheme has been strengthened and applications in respeof a further two hundred and eight    ships have been receiincluding a first application from Mexico. The N.Y.K. line oJapan has also given an undertaking equivalent to entering thescheme, and the O.S.K. line has made a similar application.The conditions of ships&apos; Navicerts are being stiffento give power to exclude undesirable enemy passengers.CONTROL OF ENEMY TRANSACTIONS.The control by Censorship authorities over suspectedfinancial contraband and financial enemy exports has been and being strengthened.
