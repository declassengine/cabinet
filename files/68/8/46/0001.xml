(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT). No,.secret.P.. (R)  (2+1)   46.17th July, 19M*WAR CABINET.Economic Warfare.I attach, for the information of my colleagues,&quot;brief report for the month of June, 1941.H.D.17 th-July, 192+1.
Consequences of The outstanding event in the field of economic the GermEn warfare during the month of June was, of course, the invasion of German invasion of Russia.     The effects of this areRussia. far-reaching.     For the time being, at least, germany has been deprived of all supplies from Russia and also from the Far Bast over the Trans-Siberian Railway;her imports from and through Iran and from Scandinaviathrough Baltic ports have been interrupted;    transport in North Eastern Germany and, to a&apos; lesser extent inthe Balkans, has been disorganised;    and at the sameconstant drain of oil to the eastern front hasbeen created and severe pressure on supplies of high explosives, rubber and steel.Further details of the consequences include thefollowing:(a) Oil stocks in German Europe will be reduced by anamount estimated at at least 250,000 tons per1 month,exclusive of war damage,  (it is too early to estimate the effect of the attacks which have already been madeon Roumanian refineries and stocks by the Russians andon a German synthetic oil plant by the R.A.F. sincethe campaign began.)(b) Germany will be cut off from her supplies of cruderubber-from the Far East, which were estimated toprovide 25 per cent of her total supplies for thecurrent year.     Her needs will at the same time be greatly increased,(c) Germany will be deprived of her imports of vege-table and marine oils from the Far East, which were estimated at about 15 per cent of the minimum require-ments of German-occupied Europe.(d) Germany will be cut off from all her Russian import of cotton, amounting to 100/125,000 tons for 191+1 outof the 185/200,000 tons which was likely to have been available to her over the same period.(e) Germany will be deprived of substantial imports ofchrome, manganese, asbestos from Russia and of small &quot;buvaluable supplies of tin from the Far East.The economic section of our Mission to Russia was 1by Mr. Lawrence Cadbury. Shipments to Russia which hadbeen held up were at once released and the Soviet Government were asked for, and provided us with, a list oftheir requirements in raw materials. Steps have beentaken, in cooperation with other Government Departments,to meet their most urgent demands.Developments The United States Government have extended theirin the U.S.A. Freezing Order to cover the assets in the U.S.A. of GerrocgJlfl South        Italy and the other countries of continental Europe and america. their colonial possessions.     They have announced thatgeneral licences to operate accounts in the U.S.A. wo\ildgiven to neutral countries on conditions ensuring, ineffect, that no benefit accrues to the enemy.     Russia hnow been excluded from the Order and general licenceshave been given to Sweden and Switzerland.     &apos;,7e have accepted an invitation of the United States Treasury to cooperate in detecting evasions./ The export
2 -The export of all petroleum products from the U.S.has &quot;been made subject to licence. ;   Exports from the pacific Coast:may. now be made only to the BritishEmpire, . Egypt and. the Western Hemisphere.     the diversion of tankej?, tonnage to British needs willrestrict st,ill further the supply of. oil to Japan,The United States Government have concluded anagreement with Brazil.under which&apos;;Brazilian exports.of  ......certain strategically&apos;import^ht Commodities are to &quot;be confined; to the :U.B.A. and countries in the western hemisphere which, have similar ^licensing - systems.    Thus,even .U.K.&quot; j?,e^u.ire.ri;ehte:.&apos;&apos;Qf &quot;v^hfe^e ^pramodit-ies- from Brazil.;will have to &quot;be obtained&apos;&apos; through ^the&apos;1 tl. 3&apos;. A.-The..United States Government is negotiating- similar agree-- ments, with pother. South&apos; American&quot; government s-.&apos;. .Supplies are on their way from *the&apos;TJvS.&apos;A.&apos;- to french north Africa, in accordance with the terms of an agree-ment &quot;between Vichy and Washington,     This agreementdeals only with shipments urgently required, not, ashad &quot;been expected, with regular quarterly shipments.The tanker &quot;Scheherazade&quot; is again sailing for africa and shipments of goods other than oil are to take placeearly in July.     For every eastbound sailing in this traffic a French ship is .to sail for America.Nine French ships were intercepted in June.The enemy have &quot;been making further efforts to import through, as well as from, Spain, and there is evidence that they are meeting with some success.Communications &quot;by sea &quot;both in the Mediterranean and inthe Atlantic have certainly &quot;been developed and smallcoasting vessels are plying regularly &quot;between Bilbaoand Bayonne .and from Barcelona to Marseilles and Genoa.There are also signs that military supplies have beentransported to the Germans and Italians in North Africafrom Spain via Naples..    The full story is not yet:available, but we hope to take counter-measures in thenear future.Early in June the movements of the German Army intoFinland became so pronounced that we could no longerregard the Finnish Government as able to prevent goods from falling into the hands of the enemy.    instructions were therefore given that no more navicerts should begranted for the Petsamo route and the Admiralty were requested to ensure that all ships bound for Petsamowere intercepted and detained,     After the outbreak ofthe Russo-German war, the further step was taken ofdetaining all Finnish ships wherever they might be found.The German invasion of Russia has placed Sweden ina difficult position.     Of her four possible, channels of import, three are now closed.     At the same time, she isunder strong pressure from Germany, and the Finns have asked for economic assistance which the swedish government feels unable to refuse.      Our policy to sweden in these new and peculiar circumstances was still under review at,the end of the month./ Iraq.
Owing to extreme congestion at the port of Basrathe issue of navicerts and export licences for iraq and for transit through that country has for thepresent &quot;been stispended.     Exceptions are &quot;being made inthe case of supplies required.&quot;by H.M. Forces, and tomeet urgent Government needs.His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy towards japan is remaining unchanged for the present.     The JapaneseGovernment are claiming that,.as communications&quot;between Japan and Germany are interrupted, restriction on exports to Japan should &quot;be relaxed.     But Japan isstill a member of the Axis and she has given no sign of any intention to re-orientate her policy:    indeed,there are indications that she may shortly &quot;be tempted to take further action.     Pressure is therefore &quot;being maintained.
