I propose to make this return monthly, and in future I expect to be&quot;ole to circulate the figures within about a week of the expiry of the periodovered by the return.Tuberculosis does not carry the same risks of sudden epidemics asthe diseases in the table, and hitherto notifications have not been requiredt short intervals.     I have however, decided as a war measure to obtainNotifications of tuberculosis at lesser intervals, and the first of thesefigures will be available at the end of Janjaary.M.M.Ei;i3TRY OF HEALTHfpth January, 194-1.

In the past the fatality rate in this disease has been more alarming than themorbidity rate.     Although the incidence of this disease during the past year has been the higheston record the fatality rate which.used to be 60/i or more fell to 22.3 per cent for England and Walesduring the first quarter of 1940, and in certain civilian hospitals to as low as 11 per cent.Figures for the last few months suggest that, under favourable circumstances, the fatality rate maybe reduced lower.     The spread of cerebro-spinal-spinal fever is promoted by undue aggregations of population.
