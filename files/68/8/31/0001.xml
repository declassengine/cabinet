Beef; The -present stock of approximately 90 thous antons: is. expected to inerease. to approximately156--&apos;thousand tens by the end of August,provided that emergency issues are not large,.
Bacon &amp; Ham:Fish:(i)During April/June home produced supplies will bedeclining but arrangements have been made to obtainsupplies from Canada, additional to the quantities underthe long term contract.     The present rations areexpected to be maintained in this period.There was some improvement in British landings of freshfish in March, as compared&apos;with February.     Suppliesof Icelandic fish were very small.(ii) Additional purchases of sardines, crayfish and tuna areto be made to help to fill the gap caused by the shortageof canned salmon.Cheese:PROTECTIVEFOODS(i) Stocks showed a further substantial increase in Marchand are likely to maintain an upward movement duringthe next three months.(ii) Shipments frcm the U.S.A. are expected to begin in April,(iii) Rationing will begin on 5th&apos;May with a weekly ration of1  oz. per head (8 ozs. for agricultural workers,underground miners and vegetarians);    if the forecastsupplies are realised a larger ration may be possible before the end of July 1941.(ii) Supplies increased in March owing to the seasonalincrease in home production and a corresponding increasein imports frcm Eire.(ii) Supplies from Canada and the U.S.A. during May and Juneare expected to off-set declining home production.They should also allow a small reserve stock of pickledeggs to be accumulated.The cut in liquid milk consumption follows a month with consumption ata record high level;    small quantities of Spanish oranges are expected;soft fruit in 1941 is being directed into jam manufacture;    allocations of dried fruit are to be reduced in May and June&apos;.&quot;-.&apos;Eggs:Fresh Milk:Condensed &amp;Dried Milk:Fresh Fruit:Jam:Dried Fruit:(i) Sales of liquid milk during March reached a record high level of 89 million   gallons;    consumption (apart frcmsales to mothers and children under the free and cheapI   milk schemes and in other special cases) was cut byl/7th as frcm 15th April.      -(ii) The latest.estimates of production during May/July are lower than those previously given.     In consequence lessmilk is now expected to be available for manufactureinto cheese and condensed milk.The.output of the home manufacturing season and increased imports will enable.a considerable expansionof stocks during the summer months.(i) Shipments of sweet oranges from Spain are expected tobe about 8 thousand tons only as compared with the contract quantity of 34 thousand tons.     The greaterj    part should arrive in April,,(ii) Maximum prices for soft fruit in 1941 will be fixed soas to encourage growers to sell to jam manufacturersj    rather than to the general public.Production of jam in April/August is likely to besufficient to meet the minimum ration requirements.   ^Imports in March were small and no improvement can beexpected until May at the earliest.     Allocations inMay and June will consequently be cut by 50/2 asj    compared with March and April.
Fresh Vegetables;The National Vegetable Marketing Company, which is tocontrol the distribution of home-grown vegetables, will deal first with onions and carrots.Tea:(i) Imports in March were the best sinceare approaching their seasonal peak.November 1939: stocksStarch;Animal Feeds;(ii) Allocations have been made to provide a fortnight&apos;s reserve of packeted stock, to be held by traders against theMinistry&apos;s instructions.Consumption of all starches in April/June is beinglimited to 43$ of consumption in the twelve months endedJune, 1939, as compared with 65fo in January/March..    Aslight increase in stocks is expected during these threemonths.(i) In April the cereal and protein coupons for livestockrationing were reduced by one half as compared withJanuary and February, but siipplementary coupons were issued for dairy cows and farm horses,(ii) Further reductions in May/August will be necessary sincearrivals of all imported feeds are likely to be small inthis period.(iii) During the summer months stocks of imported cereal feedswill be exhausted but it is hoped that end-August stocksof oilcake will not bo bo low five weeks1 requirements,based on the March rate of consumption.Transport;Retail food prices;Rationed foods;Emergency food distribution;EmergencyFeeding;V. DISTRIBUTION.(i) Movements of food by rail have been delayed by heavytraffic from the West coast ports.(ii) The transport of flour is affected by the shortage of wagons.The retail food price index increased by 1 point during march.     Bacon prices were increased on the 10th Marchby approximately 2d. a lb. on the average.The only change during March was the reduction of the meat ration from I/2d. to 1/- per head ( half for children)on 31st March.    No further rationing changes have been announced.Sufficient stocks of essential foods have been stored inthe 104 zones into which the country is divided tomaintain the population in each zone for 10-15 days.Additional emergency stocks, to be controlled by DivisionalFood Officers, are being built up.A large majority of Local Authorities of towns with a population of 50,000 and over have submitted detailedschemes for feeding people who are unable to obtain mealsin the normal way after air raids.   Specially selectedfoodstuffs have been allocated in each division for emergency feeding.VI.SUPPLIES FROM THE UNITED STATES.For April/May shipment to this country, the U.S. Department ofAgriculture has approved requests for 18 thousand tons of cheese, 15 thousand tons of raisins,  11 thousand tons of eggs in shell, 6 thousand tons of cannedfish, 4i thousand tons of canned tomatoes and 3 thousand tons of maize starch.Requests for evaporated milk for the Army in the Middle East have also beenapproved.W.j.
