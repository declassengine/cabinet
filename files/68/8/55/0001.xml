ilS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJjSS1COPY NQ. 5^,tember, 194-1&apos;.WAR CABINET,GOAL;Report by the Secretary for Mines for August.(Previous Report W. F. (R) (41)50)The return of men to the pits continued to engage the attention bothof the Mines Department and of the Ministry of Labour &amp; National Servicepromise speedy attainment of the minimum objective of 720,000 total man-power,encountered numerous difficulties and delays as the month proceeded.     A high proportion of the men who had registered - especially of those expressingwillingness to return - proved to be unfit or otherwise unsuitable, manycolliery managements were requiring their own medical examination as well asan Interview before accepting each man, existing employers were found to beusing every effort to retain valuable workers (backed in many cases by theService Departments), many men who had actually been placed were found to betaking a holiday before starting work in the mine, and when theMinistry of Labour began issuing compulsory directions to those not preparedto return voluntarily there were naturally many appeals.     The slow growth inthe total number on colliery book? - which is, of course, the net result ofadditions and natural wastage - is shown in Table II.Eventually the Production Council (the President of the Board of Tradein the Chair) with the approval of the Ministry of Labour &amp; National Service,decided that colliery managements should bo required to accept without question all men deemed suitable (after medical examination where necessary)by the Ministry of Labour and that directions, with a short time limit, shouldhe issued to every man.     Various questions relating to the release of menfrom establishments of the Supply Departments were under- consideration by theProduction Executive at the end of the month, when the number reported to havebeen placed had reached 13,447.Widespread holidays for the whole or part of the Bank Holiday week ledto a heavy fall in production (as shown in Table l) and output continues tooe affected in some districts by &quot;staggered&quot; holidays.     This factor should,throughout the month.The arrangements which seemed at the outset to
hov.&quot;evo:c 3 bo .;omc negligible after the first week in September.Fortunately the slow progress made in increasing production is beingsubrdenuially offset by savings on c!i&apos;i estimates of consumption, for thecummer half year.     These savings are duo in part to executive action,e.g, curteJImont of coal shipments abroad, concentration of industry, reducedimports and reduced stool production, and in part to the fact that insufficieallowance was made in those estimates for the effect of an exceptionally coldspring.     The revised estimate of coal required to meet consultation andshipments abroad during tho b mciiths to 1 st November next is roughly68 million tons as compared with the estimates of 93 million appended to theMay report (Y,\P.

Gruinel!(of I.C.l), with the aid of a small staff of combustion engineers, to prorxtaeconony in industrial consumption and the other, a publicity committee,representative of all the interests concerned, to conduct the campaign inregard to non-industrial consumption. While It is hoped that the activitiesof these two committees may suffice to bring consumption sufficiently near tcsupplies for the coming winter to make it unnecessary to introduce generalfuel rationing, a scheme for this purpose has for some time been in preparation as a precautionary measure and will shortly be submitted tothe Lord President&apos;s Committee.D.R.G.Mines&apos; Department.9th September, 1941
