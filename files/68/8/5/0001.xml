(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;government)SECRET.w.p. (r)   (4e)  521st January, 1941.WAR   CABINET,Economic Warfare..I attach, for the information of my colleagues,a brief report for the month of December, 1940.H.D.21st January, 1941*

ECONOMIC WARFARE DURING DECEMBER.  19u1.Direct Controls.Throughout December, His Majesty&apos;s Government continued their policy of strictly regulating the trade of the neutral countries adjacent to enemy and enemy controlled territories.Concessions have been granted to these neutrals only whereadequate counter-concessions were forthcoming.&apos; Small quantities of goods have been allowed into finland and Sweden and both countries have been given our proposalsfor an agreed settlement for the future.      In Finland we havebeen granted important rights of inspection, guaranteesagainst re-export and a limitation of exports of home products,particularly metals.      In Sweden, in return for a number of concessions which show a willingness to co-operate, arrangements have been made for an experimental reopening of the Gothenburgroute.The Spanish oil agreement was renewed for a further threemonths from December 31st.     We failed to obtain the denial of supplies to the Italian Air Line (L.A.T.I.) and so we have refused to permit imports of either aviation spirit or lubricating-cants.     Our attempts to assist Spanish economic reconstructionby financing essential imports in controlled quantities weredelayed by the Tangier incident as also were plans for dealingwith Portuguese colonial surpluses by assisting their sale to Spain.     These surpluses now appear to be smaller than was at one time supposed and Dr.. Salazar is prepared to adopt apolicy parallel to our own ,in financing their importation intoSpain.     For strategical reasons we have not been able topress as strongly as Economic Warfare considerations require for an adequate control over Spanish and Portuguese exportsthough these are known to be reaching the enemy..Our policy towards Switzerland has been influenced by(1) our desire not to force, the country into the enemy&apos;s armsand, (2) the political tension caused by R.A.F. flights overSwiss territory.     In this case, however, the dependence ofthe Swiss upon ships which they had chartered from the greeks and which can no longer enter the Mediterranean has reduced the Swiss tendency to attribute to us the responsibility fortheir shortage of supplies.     A. fresh approach to the Swiss,in which we propose co-operation to reduce their shipping difficulties, is now contemplated.The Yugoslavs have continued to put up a good resistance to German demands for deficiency metals and deliveries upon our account are still continuing.     In return for these, ad hocconcessions have been made for imports urgently needed by the yugoslavs.     A concerted programme designed to meet Yugoslavrequirements so far as permissible and to improve arrangementsfor prompt delivery is now being worked out.     The Germans arewatching these developments closely.The German attempt to reach a new trade agreement with turkey met with scanty success, possibly because the UnitedKingdom Commercial Corporation has. now been able to deal withbetween 35 and 2+0 per cent of normal Turkish exports and,more important still, has been able to undertake to supplylocomotives and wagons, which are most urgently needed.
The leak from and via French North Africa continues,though it is hoped that, if interceptions are made, they wimhave a deterrent effect on this traffic.     At present, the   \Moroccan authorities appear to have become conscious of thesmall risk which this trade involves.      The Ministry ofEconomic Warfare and the Admiralty are in consultation about!this trade and also about the French traffic passing throughthe Straits of Gibraltar.     Cargoes of German deficiencycommodities, including groundnuts and rubber, have been re-ceived at Marseilles.     There is strong evidence to show tha;lthe greater part of these cargoes have gone, not to unoccupiJFrance, but to Germany and Italy.Indirect Controls.Following the successful detention of the &quot;Sequeira CarJthe Lloyd Brasiliero Company have now agreed in principle tojenter the Ships&apos; Warrant scheme. Of 283 ships which during!December, undertook voyages into waters where ships&apos; navicerjare required, only one sailed without the necessary document!A friendly warning to the Spanish Government about thedifficulties that might follow a repetition of such an inciclappears to have had satisfactory results. Colonel Donovan!has displayed interest in the basic ideas underlying the ShjWarrant scheme and the fact that it can be used by a neutral!as a means of indirect pressure on a belligerent without -invoking belligerent rights has been explained to him.Meanwhile, the United States administration continues tlfollow what appears to be an erratic path.      While they stillrefuse to commit themselves to discussions about regulation!commodities, they have expressed willingness to considerspecific cases such as wheat, sugar and cotton.      Meanwhile,our pre-emptive and surpluses purchases policy is in partsupported by their ?preclusive&apos; purchases.      But the recent Ideals in copper in South America have lost much of their efilbecause they were not made conditional upon control overexports to dangerous destinations.     The United States ExporlLicensing List is being tightened up and co-operation inlimiting the freedom of action of enemy financial interests Econtinues:    but the administration are not yet prepared toextend this control so as to limit exports to Japan of many Iimportant commodities (including oil).The effect of denying insurance and reinsurance to ship!outside the Warrant Scheme appears to have had some slightresult in Japan.     After it had been made clear to theJapanese that the warrant was indispensable if insurance wasto be underwritten, some Japanese interest was aroused in ttpossibility of admitting a limited number of Japanese ships to the Scheme.      Italian hulls have now become well-nighuninsurable, as the leading insurance companies both inGermany and Japan refuse to underwrite them.During December 36 fresh cases and 10 old ones were finally decided by the Contraband Committee.    Seizure amountto 2,500 tons was made in Ik cases and 3 small French ships were seized.      87 applicants for exemption from enemy exportcwere considered and exemption granted in 26 cases.    10 out c31 applicants for   certificates of origin and interest were refused.     A new point has been raised in export control &quot;by american purchaser of French wines who offered to pay thepurchase money to the Custodian of Enemy property in London&apos;This offer was refused on the ground that the object of theexport control was to produce trade stagnation in enemy-occupied and controlled countries.
