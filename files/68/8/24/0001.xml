ii j-fiyjOODSdehydrates)IV. COMMODITY SUPPLY POSITION.The fall in wheat stocks continues; consumption of flour hasincreased; demand for oatmeal has outstripped present production;the danger of a shortage of rice has diminished; sugar stocks are showing a seasonal decline; the potato surplus (Great Britain)is now estimated at 250 thousand tons.Wheat &amp; Flour;Oatmeal:RiceSugar;(i) Reserve stocks have &quot;been declining since theend of September.    The fall during February(153 thousand tons) was greater than in any ofthe previous four months.(ii) Consumption of flour during February was136 thousand tons a week (wheat equivalent)as compared with a weekly average of 122thousand tons during Sept.1940/Jan,1941*    Theincrease is due to the shortage of other foods.(iii)   Using the same basis as in past calculations(i.e. consumption of flour at 125 thousand tonsa week - wheat equivalent) reserve stocks at end February were equal to 12.6 weeks&apos; flourrequirements; at the present level of con-sumption they were equal to only 11.5 weeksflour requirements.(iv)   Even with increased allocations of shippingno increase in stocks is expected during march/May; end May reserve stocks are forecast at 11.1 weeks&apos; flour requirements (based onthe present loyel of consumption).(v)   Although millers have increased the number of hours worked per week, stocks held as flourhave not increased.    Recent air-raid damage toflour mills has reduced output.Production is 50fo above pre-war, but is still not adequate to meet existing ^demands.An increase in expected April arrivals has reduced the danger of a shortage of whole rice.(i)   A seasonal decline in stocks is now in progress and will continue until the new home beet cropis available in late October.(ii)   Consumption will be reduced as a result of a cut in the Services&apos; ration (l?!- oizs. to 14ozs. per week) but requirements for syrup andtreacle have increased.Potatoes: The latest estimates of stocks and consumption in Great Britain suggest a substantial surplusover human requirements from the 1940 cropStocks of oilseeds increased during February; the soft oil position has improved but the outlook for hard oils is not good; the butter position is strong in the immediate future but a return to a2 oz. allowance is foreseen.Oilseeds,Vegetable &amp;        (i) Imports of oilseeds during February were 50j$Whale Oils: higher than the low figure for January, but the. , February oil imports were small.(ii)(iii)-2-The soft oil position was strengthened by goodarrivals of ground nuts and cottonseed, but hardoil stocks declined further.    Linseed stocks are adequate.The present upward trend in soft oil stocks isexpected to continue in March.    Whilst no^?civilian 5lj?nc&amp;apg? I^hard oils is expected in&quot;CDl cappreciable change in hariMarch, April forecasts show a weaker position

Margarine &amp;Cooking fats:Butter:(i)(ii)The new catch of whale oil by 3:rrLtisb--expedj tionsis expected to produce 36-,-000 tons.As long as the butter allowance under the combinedration is 4-ozs. it is possible to build up stocks of margarine and compound lard, which are badly needed inview of the vulnerability to air attack of the plant at all stages of the processing of oils and fats.Arrivals in February were good and forecast arrivalsand home production in March/May are 15 thousand tonsin excess of consumption under the k- oz. allowance.The 4 oz. allowance cannot be continued beyond Juneowing to the forthcoming -crans-rer of refrigeratedshipping space to meat.The outlook for animal protein focdr-, already in very short supply,XN  is poor.     The meat ration has been reduced from Is. 2d. to Is., fishsupplies are affected by a suspension of sailings frcm Iceland, and canned salmon distribution is being cut. Cheese supplies should increase in thefuture. The maintenance of the bacon ration after June is dependent uponincreased imports being obtained.Meat:BacomFishtCheese;Eggs:(i) The Is.2d. ration in February was met with theassistance of small releases of corned beef.   Manyconsumers did not accept corned beef willingly.(ii) The ration has been reduced to Is. in the weekcommencing 31st Marcho   Present forecasts of suppliesof butchers&apos; meat during April/May are lower than the quantities required to meet a Is. 2d. ration.(iii) It is expected that under  he livestock reductionpolicy now envisaged additional supplies of about150 thousand tons of home killed meat will become available in the period June-August.   Much of this willbe suitable only for manufacture.(i) Home production is expected to fall steadily frcm the february rate of k- thousand tons a week to less than2 thousand tons a week in August.(ii) Unless additional imports are obtained, it will bedifficult to maintain the present k- oz. ration afterJune.(i) If continued, the suspension of sailings of Icelandicvessels will reduce supplies of fresh and frozen fish.(ii) In view of the uncertainty of obtaining further supplies of canned salmon until September/October,allocations for April have been suspended.   Allocationsfor May onwards have been reduced to 30$ of pre-warquantities (60/  was distributed in December/March) .(i) Stocks increase,, slightly in February but it is notpossible in the immediate future to increase the rateof distribution,(ii) Supplies are expected to be substantially greaterduring the summer month so(iii) It is proposed to introduce a rationing scheme forcheese, with priority issues to miners and-agricultural workers, early in MaycTotal supplies are estimated to be even lower inFebruary than in January0   The shortage is most acutein the larger cities.-     A scheme for controlling thedistribution of eggs is being formulated.

jVE Liquid milk consumption is being reduced in Apriljoranges from Spain are expected to begin to arrive in April;are still in ample supply.carrotsFresh Milk;Fresh Fruit;Jam andMarmalade:(i) Shortage of feed has been experienced particularlyin areas of intense feeding;    producers in these areas are receiving some additional supplies offeeds.(ii) It is estimated that, under favourable grazingconditions, milk production in April/September1941 will be 85;i to 90$ of the correspondingmonths in 1939.(iii) Consumption (apart from the National Milk SchemssSchool Milk and sales to hospitals) is being reduced in April by l/7th.     The reduction willbe continued during the summer monthsMilk for manufacture into cheese and condensed milk will thus be increased by 50 million gallonsuA contract for 34r thousand tons of sweet orangesfrom Spain has been made and the first arrivalsare expected in April.Existing stocks of Jam are equal to 6 weeks&quot;supply at the Jan./Feb0 rate cf consumption,,Fruit pulp sufficient to make a further 25 week&apos;sjam supply (at the same rate of consumption) isin stock. *Dried Fruit:Reductions in allocations will be necessary-April and May, owing to delayed arrivals of greek and Turkish fruityMODITIESFresh Vegetables; The consumption of carrots has increasedfollowing the Ministry&apos;s publicity campaignsSupplies are still amplecTea;End April 1941 stocks are forecast at aboutnormal pre-war stocks at that period of the year.Starch:Considerable cuts in allocationnecessary in April.will beJAL iVifliDS; (i) In April cereal and protein coupons for farm livestock will bereduced by one half, but supplementary rations will be issued for dairy cows.(ii) The present deficiency of approximately 25/3 in supplies offeed concentrates is estimated to increase to about 60$ inMay-August, unless there are drastic and immediate livestockreductions, in the pig and poultry populations particularly.(iii) Summer rations for livestock are being discussed with the agriculture Departments.V.    DISTRIBUTIONPORT &amp; (i) Rail transport in the north was handicapped by February snow ^SQUSING- storms, but further south it improved,    A shortage of road transport is being experienced in several districts.(ii) The building programme together with space to be obtained through the Board of Trade Limitation of Supplies Order should increase warehouse space from 740 thousand tons to 1,100thousand tons by bh** end of 1941.4

&quot;5*118The retail food price index fell by 2 points during February,as a result of reductions in egg prices0POODS There were no changes in civilian rations during February,,A minimum share scheme for sweet preserves came into operation as from17th March, and* cheese rationing will soon be introduced,     The three services agreed to make reductions in their ration scales.VT.      POSSIBLE SUPPLIES FROM THE UNITED STATESEstimates of probable food and feed requirements in theperiod March 1941 - June 1942 have been submitted to the United states administration.     If the supplies are obtainable (which is doubtfulin some cases) and shipping space is available., the position of meat,bacon, canned meat, cheese, milk products, pulses and canned fish willbe strengthened.ry of Pood,t March, 1941.
