(R) (41) 38.May 23, 1941.WAR CABINET.REPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 1941 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES, PROTECTORATES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.1. General Position.AT the beginning of the month the position in regard to war production had improved, with the introduction of a new programme of shipbuilding. In themiddle of April, however, strikes in the basic steel industry threatened to extend,and concern was expressed about the available supply of labour and about thedefiance by the Congress of Industrial Organization of Government rulings in industrial disputes. The situation eased later, and by the end of the monthcomparative industrial peace was restored. The &quot; immense war production ofAustralia&quot; was favourably commented upon.In the field of Empire relations, there was a movement in the press, whichwas endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition, for the summoning of an ImperialConference, and most papers urged that Air. Mackenzie King should visitLondon, though Devoir, the organ of the French Canadians in Quebec, recalledthe fact that conscription had followed the return of Sir Robert Borden from asimilar visit in 1917.The Premiers of the nine Provinces have been invited to Ottawa to discussseparately the Canadian Governments budget proposal that Provincial Govern-ments should relinquish taxes on personal and corporation incomes for the duration of the war. The severity of the new Canadian taxation proposals is reported tohave staggered public opinion.On events in the British Isles, some concern was shown over reports ofinefficiency and selfishness during the exodus from Plymouth.A further attack was made on Mr. de Valera&apos;s &quot; suicidal &quot; attitude, and his policy was described as &quot;unprofitable&quot; and &quot;inglorious.&quot;In foreign affairs, the progress of events in Greece was followed with anxiety,and some depression was caused by gloomy despatches from the United Statesof America. Mr. churchill&apos;s speech, however, did much to rally the doubters,and one paper went so far as to say that &quot;when .... British forces are compelled to withdraw .... the battle for the key position in the Mediterraneanwill then only be starting.&quot; On the other hand, a realistic, attitude towardsevents in Libya was maintained. &quot;What good did this victorious offensive in[22542] B
Libya do \ It annihilated an enemy army of 200.000, destroyed considerablematerial, and seized munitions almost equal to the amount lost at Dunkirk. Isthat nothing? &quot; (L&apos; Action Catholique).The United States-Danish agreement over Greenland was welcomed, andthere was warm approval for the Prime Ministers visit to Washington, and forthe statement about United States-Canadian co-operation which followed it. Theproposal that President Roosevelt should visit Ottawa was enthusiasticallyacclaimed.The visit of General de Gaulle&apos;s representative, Captain D&apos;Argenlieu, isreceiving full publicity, but support is still shown for Petain, although one news-paper commented &quot; if he disappeared, I think all Frenchmen would unite againstHitler.&quot;&quot; Great indignation was shown in ail quarters by the incident at Nemours,when the French opened fire on British control vessels. One French-Canadianpaper (Le Jour) is now hostile to Petain, one (Devoir) supports him, and one(UAction Catholique) is impartial.The visit of the Polish Prime Minister, General Sikorski, to North america has been received with much satisfaction.Otto Strasser, the anti-Nazi leader, is believed to be now in Montreal.2. Naval, Military and Air Activities.A large batch of approximately 900 Empire air-trained air crews arrived inthe United Kingdom from Canada at the end of the month.Air Commodore Johnson, Deputy Chief of the Canadian Air Staff, and AirCommodore Anderson, A.O.C. Eastern Air Command of the R.C.A.F., arrived in the United Kingdom for a period of attachment to the R.A.F.3. Economic Activities.Discussions have been proceeding with the Canadian Government with regardto the problem of financing United Kingdom purchases and expenditure inCanada. The Canadian Government have offered, on certain understandings, touse their best endeavours to continue meeting the United Kingdom&apos;s full deficitwith Canada by the repatriation of securities and the accumulation of sterling balances, and this generous offer should greatly simplify the problem.An important agreement relating to supply and finance was reached between mr. Mackenzie King and President Roosevelt at their meeting at Hyde Parkon the 20th April. It was agreed as a general principle that in mobilising theresources of North America, Canada and the United States of America should provide each other with the defence articles which each is best able to produce and, above all, produce quickly, and that production programmes should become-ordinated to this end. It was estimated that Canada would be able to supply the United States in the next twelve months with some $200 to $300 million ofsuch articles, and payment for these supplies would materially assist Canada in meeting part of the cost of Canadian defence purchases in the United States.Moreover, it was agreed that component parts imported from the United Statesof America into Canada for the production of supplies for the United kingdom should be obtained by the United Kingdom on lease-lend terms, thereby furtherreducing Canada&apos;s adverse balance of payments with the United States ofAmerica.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.4. General Position.The campaign in the Balkans developed in the course of the month into a major domestic issue in Australia. It may not be out of place to give here aresume of the facts.At the end of the first week in April (the 8th April) the news of the arrival of the Australian and New Zealand troops was received with a &quot; deep sense ofpride,&quot; although there was no disposition to underrate their task. A week later,however, as the news of early German successes began to come through, the ActingPrime Minister, Mr. Fadden, made a statement to the press about the delay in thesupply of information from the front, and also of the decision of the Common-
wealth Government not to consult the Advisory War Council (which representsall parties). Although Mr. Fadden did his best &quot;to damp down the press campaignwhich followed, certain Sydney papers could not resist the temptation of makingcapital out of the alarming reports from Europe to secure either a change ofGovernment in Australia or a coalition.By the 18th April wholesale charges were being made against the Britishconduct of the war by the London editor of the Sydney Telegraph, and the Sun,encouraged by the attitude of the London Daily Mail, enquired why australian troops had been &apos;&apos; offered up before superior numbers and superior equipment in what had apparently been a political manoeuvre.&quot; By the 23rd April, as the news continued to worsen, the Sydney Telegraph wrote: &quot; A little more of the truth.....is beginning to come out,&quot; and complained, on the authority of twoAmerican columnists, that only three Imperial divisions, &quot; most of them Anzacs,&quot;had been sent against 60 German divisions. The Sun wrote on the same day : &quot; Asa military adventure it was madness. As a political gesture it was stupid, as itwas bound to fail.&quot; The important Sydney newspaper, the Morning Herald,deprecated recrimination, while the attitude of the remaining Australian presswas summed up in the Brisbane Courier Mail, which attacked irresponsiblehvsterical outcries which immediately clamour for scapegoats.&quot;The crisis became most acute on the 23rd and 24th April, when the Govern-ment were reported to be &quot; badly rattled.&quot; On the night of the 23rd, one of their supporters in Parliament had died, leaving the balance of parties such that the decisive vote lay with an entirely irresponsible Independent member. parliament was summoned for the 7th May, and at the same time Mr. Fadden invitedMr. Curtin, the Labour Leader, to form an all-party Government.The situation was made worse by reports, sent by some correspondents to theUnited States, and passed by the Censor, suggesting that a wave of defeatismamong some Sydney business men, and in Labour circles in New South Wales, wasprevalent throughout the Commonwealth. In fact, this was not the case,public opinion in other States, as expressed through the press, being entirelyunobjectionable.The crisis died down as a result of three main causes : Mr. Churchill&apos;s speechgiving the true facts; the German propaganda attempts to divide Australia from great Britain which, in fact, had exactly the opposite effect; and Mr. Menzies&apos;broadcast on the subject from London. The Labour Party denounced the attitudeof the Sydney press concerned, and the New South Wales Labour leaders went outof their way to make strong speeches in support of the war effort, and it is now considered improbable that the Opposition who are unlikely to accept the invita-tion to form a National Government will attempt to bring about the fall of theMenzies Cabinet. By the end of the month, the Sydney press was beating anundignified retreat, blaming, as it did so, those London papers which had startedthe scare, the B.B.C., which had suggested that all the fighting in Greece was doneby the Anzaes, and finally, the Australian Censorship for allowing misleading-messages to be sent to America, The Sun wrote : &apos;&apos; We are brothers in arms readyto live or die together.&apos;Interest was so closely centred on the Balkans that there was little comment on other events. At the beginning of the month the Nemours incident was regarded as &quot; an intolerable breach of neutrality,&quot; while the announcement ofthe Soviet-Japanese Pact led to a call for &quot; vigilance in the Pacific.&quot;Mr. Menzies, the Commonwealth Prime Minister, prolonged his visit to thiscountry in view of the situation in the Balkans and the Middle East, and he was still here at the end of the month. He continued his discussions with UnitedKingdom Ministers and departments.5. Naval, Military and Air Activities.An agreement implementing those articles of the Empire Air training scheme Agreements in which the United Kingdom Government undertook thatpupils trained under the scheme would, after training, be identified with theirrespective Dominions Avas negotiated with the Commonwealth Government. Thisagreement, which follows the lines of that already made with Canada, providesfor the formation of eighteen R.A.A.E. Squadrons but of the output of Australiantrainees. These squadrons will be at the disposal of, and paid for by, the UnitedKingdom Government.
From Anzac Day until the evacuation the Australian and New Zealand forcesin Greece fought as an Anzac Corps.Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Blarney, Officer Commanding the AustralianImperial Force in the Middle East, has been appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief, Middle Fast.6. Economic Activities.Discussions are proceeding with Mr. Bruce and the Commonwealth Govern-ment in regard to the arrangements provisionally reached with Mr. Menzies forthe joint financing of Australians agricultural surpluses.NEW ZEALAND.7. General Position.The political situation in New Zealand is more stable than in Australia, andthe reaction of New Zealand opinion to the Greek campaign was in consequencesounder. In fact, the Australian crisis had practically no echo at all in NewZealand, where comment was at first optimistic, then cautious; angry over theLondon Daily Mail campaign, and anxious over the fate of the New Zealandtroops in Greece. As in Australia, Mr. Churchill&apos;s statement quelled anylingering doubts about the wisdom of undertaking this hazardous enterprise, andthe final New Zealand judgment on the intervention in Greece may be summarised in this extract : &quot; If it was a mistake to send British troops to Greece, it was an honourable mistake.&quot;Some dissatisfaction was, however, shown because information about theAustralian troops greatly exceeded the information about New Zealand troopsin the hands of the New Zealand Government.Public opinion otherwise continues to be divided in interest among a numberof items, without any lively reaction to any of them, with the exception of the anxiety shown in trading circles about the actual and potential economic situation.After the exporting primary industries, it is now the turn of the importingsecondary industries to be anxious about shipping, although all interests realise the essential importance of reserving space for troop movements. A certainanxiety was shown over the Soviet-Japanese pact, but. generally, the situationremains calm, and the Prime Minister, Mr. Eraser, before leaving on his journeyto England, deferred consideration of the formation of a National Government,although he offered a seat in the Cabinet during his absence to Mr. Holland, the leader of the Opposition.8. Naval, Military and Air Activities.An agreement regarding the arrangements to be made for the identificationwith the Dominion of New Zealand air crew pupils trained under the EmpireAir Training Scheme, on the lines of the agreements made with the canadian and Commonwealth Governments, was negotiated with the New Zealand Govern-ment. It provides for the formation of six R.N.Z.A.F. Squadrons out of theoutput of New Zealand trainees.Major-General Freyberg was appointed to command the Allied Forces inCrete.All units of the Home Defence Forces have reached their prescribed totalestablishment and approximately 1,300 officers and 30,000 other ranks have completed three months&apos; continuous training. The New Zealand Home Guardnumbers 80,000, but the large majority are still unarmed.The New Zealand Government have been asked to proceed with the manu-facture of fuses. 450 Universal carriers have been ordered in the Dominion for new Zealand&apos;s own requirements. 2,000 women are being trained for munitions production.9. Economic Activities.Discussions are proceeding with Mr. Jordan and the New Zealand Govern-ment in regard to arrangements for the joint financing of New Zealand&apos;ssurpluses, particularly of meat and dairy products.
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.10. General Position.The main political event of the month was the meeting of the Federal Councilof the Nationalist party. The council s non-committal proposals included aperfunctory reference to equal rights for both sections of the community, but thecreation of a Republic &quot; by a simple majority &quot; took precedence over all detailedquestions. The Council considered British parliamentary methods &quot; a down-right failure&quot; in South Africa, but added that National Socialism was not appropriate to the Afrikaner^ way of life; nevertheless, qualifying the latterstatement by remarking that the bogy of &quot; nazification &quot; of the Union by a victorious Germany was the work of &quot; hysterical propaganda.&quot;This uninspiring document was bitterly attacked by Mr. du Toit, one ofMr. Pirow*s lieutenants, who was in turn attacked by Messrs. Strydom and Louw.An attack was also made on it by the Afrikaner party (Hertzogites), since itomitted a reference to equal political rights.It will be seen that fissiparous tendencies continue in the Opposition. Atthe same time, the situation is not altogether satisfactory. The report of theCommission of Enquiry on the Johannesburg riots last March laid the blame bothon the soldiers and on the police, and comments on the report seem to suggestthat the extremist organisation, Ossewa Brandwag. now has a membership ofnot less than 350,000. Later in the month, nineteen members of the staff of theUniversity of Stellenbosch, representing one-quarter of the staff of the University,but including many of the best-known leaders in Afrikander culture, protested against the infiltration of Nazi doctrines into the Union, and the acting UnitedKingdom High Commissioner, who described their manifesto as useful, at thesame time considered it disquieting, since its publication, he thinks, indicateshow far evil tendencies have gone.Apart from this, the month was largely marked by a lull, and the press ofthe &quot; official &quot; Opposition has been strangely objective in its comments on thewar. The next phase of the war in Africa, involving the use of Union troops inEgypt, may, however, precipitate a crisis.Mr. Churchill&apos;s latest broadcast is reported to have had a strikingly good effect in heartening pro-Government opinion, and placing recent events in greece and North Africa in their proper perspective.The passage through the House of Assembly of a resolution giving Asiaticsthe right to own land in certain areas has revived an Opposition campaign forthe segregation of Indians.All sections of public opinion were deeply impressed by the United KingdomBudget.Nationalist agitation against the wool agreement with the United Kingdomcontinues, and now takes the line that farmers in the Union were paying theprice of the Union Governments subservience to Britain.Both Opposition and pro-Government newspapers are impressed by thedevelopment of United States policy regarding help for Britain, and, inparticular, by the question of American convoys for shipping. Some support isfound for the suggestion by the Deputy Prime Minister, &quot;made without consulting anybody,&quot; that the United States should be invited to assume theguardianship of Abyssinia.11. Naval, Military and Air Activities.Part of the South African Air Force took part in operations in Cyrenaica.The Union Government have considered the recommendations of the eastern group Conference as to development of munitions production in the Union andhave discussed these with the United Kingdom authorities; certain developmentsare already in hand.12. Economic A activities.The Union Government are preparing to introduce some measures of import control which will curtail expenditure on non-essentials and be of help inconserving the dollar resources of the sterling area.
NEWFOUNDLAND.13. General Position.The two Representatives of Newfoundland visited Washington on their return journey to discuss matters arising out of the Agreement with the UnitedStates Government relating to the lease of bases in Newfoundland. They werecordially received and had satisfactory conversations. They were satisfied thatthere is no desire to exercise jurisdiction over British subjects in Newfoundlandeven in respect of security offences.The Permanent Joint Defence Board for Canada and the United States haveagreed in principle that Newfoundland Representatives should be invited toattend meetings at which the defence of Newfoundland is coming underdiscussion.The Admiralty and the Government of Newfoundland have agreed inprinciple to a proposal that all the naval personnel serving in Newfoundlandshould be placed entirely under the direction of the Royal Canadian naval authorities.The negotiations for the transfer of the air bases in Newfoundland to canada for the duration of the war have been completed and an Agreementapproved by the Governments of Canada and Newfoundland lias been submittedto His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for their approval. Aproposal that United States personnel and aircraft may make use of the newfoundland airport and other air bases is under consideration.14. Naval, Military and Air Activities.No further contingents from Newfoundland have arrived in this country during the month.15. Economic Activities.The Government of Newfoundland have agreed to supply a further contin-gent of 400 Loggers for service in this country.They have been asked to agree, in the interests of the food supply of theUnited Kingdom, to the continuance of the suspension for one year more of theduty of 10 per cent, on certain kinds of white fish, under which, by virtue of the ottawa Agreement, they enjoy a preference.16. Southern Rhodesia.Nothing of importance to report.EIRE.17. General Position.Mr. Aiken, the Eire Minister for Defence Co-ordination, has been in theUnited States throughout the month engaged in trying to buy arms and ammuni-tion, ships and food supplies. Acting on instructions from his Government,Mr. Gray, the United States Minister in Dublin, has informed Mr. de Valerathat, in view of the past friendly relations between the United States and Eire,they are willing to make two ships available to Eire on charter or on sale.Mr. Gray made it clear that this offer was deliberately not made through mr.. Aiken in view of his anti-British attitude in the United States. Mr. Graywent on to hint that Mr. Aiken should now return to his own country. TheMinister has also informed the Eire Government that arms and ammunitioncannot be supplied to Eire as they are reserved for those actively engaged in thestruggle. He added that the United States could not quarrel with Eire&apos;s policyof neutrality, but regarded her attitude as the reverse of helpful. His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington has been instructed to explain to the Administrationthat, in view of our own dollar position, we should not be prepared to make available dollars from our resources to Eire for these ships.
In addition to the two ships to be obtained from the United States, Eire has succeeded in obtaining two other ships in Europe. She has also arranged forquantities of wheat to be shipped in neutral vessels to ports in Spain and Portugal,whence it is hoped to carry it to Eire. Nevertheless, the supplies position con-tinues to exercise the minds of the Government and people in Eire. The reductionin the quantity of tea supplied to Eire to 25 per cent, of normal consumptioncontinues to be canvassed in the Eire press and forms the basis of the arguments of those who maintain that the United Kingdom Government is bringing economic pressure to bear upon Eire for political ends. On the other hand, the Minister ofSupplies has announced that the supply position in regard to petrol is easier andthat private car owners may shortly get a small ration.During the recent air raids on Belfast, fire brigades and rescue squads from eire went to the assistance of the North. Refugees streaming south were relieved by Red Cross units in Eire and funds were started with good response.Mr. de Valera publicly expressed his sympathy with the victims. These eventsappear to have had the effect both of deepening the feeling of the average man in eire against Germany and of increasing his desire to remain neutral in order toavoid being bombed.Amongst minor developments worthy of mention is the issue of an Order in eire forbidding neon and other display lighting and the lighting of shop windowsafter closing time. Ostensibly this has been done to save electricity : actually it follows representations from the United Kingdom Government. The eire government have also made arrangements, at Sir John Maffey&apos;s request, for the broadcasting en clair of the movements of unknown aircraft over Eire, and haveagreed to exclude from such broadcasts movements of aircraft over the corridorof Eire territory between Lough Erne and Donegal Bay used by British flying-boats operating from the former on the Atlantic patrol.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.18. Political Situation.(i) Civil Disobedience. There are still no signs of any mass enthusiasm for mr. Gandhi&apos;s anti-war campaign of civil disobedience, though the numbers ofpersons offering satyagraha have been definitely higher than in the previous month, namely, some two or three thousand persons each week. (The latest reportsshow a marked decline in numbers as compared with the preceding weeks, andthere is thus no evidence of any continuing tendency for the numbers to increase.)Of those courting arrest in this way, about three-quarters have been arrested, thevast majority of them being in the United Provinces, where the movement hascontinued to be mainly concentrated. It may perhaps be hoped that recent actionwhich has been taken against the organisers of the movement there will haveuseful results. Outside the United Provinces most cases have been deliberatelyignored, with good effect.As regards the scale and continuance of the movement, Mr. Gandhi recentlystated that &quot;Whether civil disobedience is offered by one or many is of nomoment. It must continue against all odds,&quot; and he added that &quot; extraordinaryprecaution is being taken to keep the movement within limits and absolutelyinnocuous.&quot;The latest figures available show that, on the 1st March, 4,422 persons wereundergoing imprisonment in connection with the movement, and that the cumulative total of convictions up to the middle of March was 7,183.(ii) Political interest has remained centi-ed on the move of Sir T. B. Sapruand his supporters at the Bombay Conference, of which the recommendations were described in paragraph 2 of the last Report. Lord Linlithgow, in inter-views accorded to Sir T. B. Sapru, gave him opportunity to develop his scheme.It will be remembered that this comprised an immediate declaration that dominion Status would be granted within a specified time after the war andthe constitution now of an all-Indian Executive Council to be responsible during
sthe interim period not to the Legislature but to the Crown and to have thestatus of a Dominion Government in external matters. Meantime resolutions were passed by the All-India Moslem League reaffirming their support of the pakistan project of independent Muslim (and Hindu) States with no Indiancentral executive and by the All-India Mahasabha dissociating themselves fromthe Bombay resolutions and strongly condemning the Moslem League&apos;s proposals.Thus Sir T. B. Sapru&apos;s plan, apart from the fact that it contained elementsincompatible with His Majesty&apos;s Governments declaration of August last whichthe Viceroy and His Majesty&apos;s Government could not accept, was held to failfrom the outset for lack of the support which would be necessary for the enlargedExecutive Council to be able to function as a Government.(iii) Opportunity was taken in Parliament, on the occasion of the passageof the necessary statutory resolutions to prolong the administration by Governorswithout Ministries or Legislatures in seven provinces in which congress ministries resigned in October 1939. to indicate His Majesty&apos;s governments intention to maintain their proposals of August 1940, which spoke of addingrepresentative Indians to the existing Council, and their inability to accept theSapru scheme. Encouragement was. however, given to the formation of a centreparty willing to co-operate in the prosecution of the war and prepaired to find the necessary support in the country. Criticism by Indian political leaders andin the Indian press of the speeches in the Parliamentary debates has followed the anticipated party lines. Mr. Gandhi professes great indignation at the inter-p relation placed by His Majesty*s Government on the refusal of Congress toco-operate. Moderate leaders who were concerned in the Sapru proposals express a feeling of frustration at the failure of their efforts. Meantime some criticism of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s continuance of the policy of non-co-operation is developing in congress newspapers and there are signs that in the Muslim as well as theCongress camps there is some division in regard to the policy to be pursued.(iv) It is worth mentioning that, despite the All-India Hindu Mahasabha&apos;sadvocacy of an early date for Dominion Status and of an all-Indian executivenow at the Centre, its President recently telegraphed asking that the ministry in Bengal should be suspended and its powers assumed by the present Governoron the ground of its failure to deal effectively with Hindu-Muslim communalriots.19. Military A flairs.(i) One Indian Brigade group has been sent to Basra, where it arrived on the18th April. Further reinforcements are arriving and the force will be brought up to a strength of five brigades early in June.(ii) The Government of India have agreed to provide personnel for twoIndian A.A. regiments for Singapore.(iii) The arrangements to provide India with 71 Lysander aircraft (referredto in Report No. 24) have been revised. The Canadian authorities have found itimpossible to release 41 airframes. which will now be supplied from this country.Some delay in delivery will result.(iv) The Government of India have made a special offer of further assistancein the Middle East and are despatching six battalions of the Indian states forces, an Artisan Works Company, three Supply Issue Sections, together withcertain equipment, and 500 vehicles, during May.(v) The Government of India have submitted a review of the defences ofIndia based on the changed situation in the Far East, which implies a potentialthreat to the Eastern Frontier of India, This plan is at present under considera-tion by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.20. Foreign and Frontier Relations.(i) Afghanistan. Following on his discussions with the Afghan Govern-nient in March on Anglo-Afghan relations, the British Minister at Kabul was instructed to inform the Afghan Prime Minister that His Majesty&apos;s government accepted his personal guarantee (that the Afghan attitude would not while hewas alive be a cause of embarrassment to the British Government during the
war), while making it clear that we were not satisfied with the present position,and that, as the Prime Minister would, of course, realise, the value of hisassurances must be judged by the actual position now and in the future in afghanistan with regard to German contacts, propaganda and infiltration. TheBritish Minister has now had further discussions with the Foreign Minister onthe 9th April (the Prime Minister being unwell) and with the Prime and foreign ministers on the 19th April. These interviews took place in a calmer atmosphereand the Afghan attitude was sufficiently reasonable to enable Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytler to resume discussions with the Afghan Government on economic matters.Throughout the earlier interview the Foreign Minister laid great stress on two points [a) the continued anxiety of the Afghan Government about Russia,whose Government remained most suspicious about Afghan relations with us, and(b) the fact that there was no change in the Afghan Governments desire tocultivate the best possible relations with the British Government. The british minister believes that the Afghan Government are sincere as regards (b), but,unfortunately, they have linked with it a determination to maintain their pre-war economic relations with Germany and are unwilling or indisposed to realise thepolitical dangers in this connection.At the second interview on the 19th April, the Prime Minister, though stillsomewhat indisposed, was very friendly. He said that the Afghan government&apos;s policy of neutrality had been the only course for them to adopt at the outbreak ofwar, but reiterated that his sympathies and those of his Cabinet remained withthe British cause and would not change. He was gratified at His Majesty&apos;governments acceptance of his guarantee and would do his best to implement it.He admitted that, in view of the situation in the Balkans and in Africa, german propaganda might be having some temporary effect among the younger elements in Kabul.As a result of these talks His Majesty&apos;s Minister feels reassured as to thePrime Ministers attitude, and believes that he has the majority of the Govern-ment behind him, but two disquieting features about the present situation are(a) that the Government and Royal Family are not*at all popular in the countryand there are many rumours of impending trouble, and (b) the admittedly strong-position of the Germans in Afghanistan and the influence of their propaganda.The rumours of internal disturbances in Afghanistan are partly seasonal, andHis Majesty&apos;s Minister would not attach great importance to them by themselves.The possible danger in the situation is that events in the Balkans, and particularly the future attitude of Turkey, might give the Germans an opportunity, whileremaining in the background, to foment a revolution and bring about the downfallof the present regime. There is a pro-German tendency among the youngerAfghan intelligentsia and the official classes who are liable to be easily swayedby the fluctuations of the present struggle. The country is generally quiet andAfghan opinion outside the cities is not at present much affected one way or theother, but it is likely to be influenced by the attitude of Turkey.The first reactions of the Afghan Government to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsoffer to purchase Afghan wool and the Government of India&apos;s offer to purchasemore cotton have been somewhat unsatisfactory, the Afghans asking for very high prices.(ii) North-West Frontier. The Faqir of Ipi has remained at his head-quarters at Gorwekt, where he continues with some success to intensify anti-Government activities. It is, however, reported that neither the Wazirs nor theMahsuds show signs of wishing to become involved in large-scale hostilities. air action against the Faqir was again taken on the 9th and the 24th April. In bothSouth and North Waziristan there have been minor incidents. A gang of 200hostiles attacked Spinwam post on the 9th April and fired six shells from a gun(all misses); a V.B. gun being also used. There were no casualties. A fine ofRs. 1,000 has been demanded from the section of the tribe responsible for theterritory concerned, together with 20 rifles and 20 hostages. An attack was madeon a military convoy on the 22nd April, north of Razmak, several persons being-wounded.  The situation in North Waziristan has recently deteriorated.In Bannu District a police post was overpowered by a party of hostiles on the17th April and suffered casualties.Elsewhere the frontier has remained quiet.(iii) Nepal. On the occasion of his birthday the Maharaja has made furtherdonations to funds for the relief of war victims in this country and in India.
21. Indian States.The Viceroy, in his speech at the recent session of the Chamber of Princesfor the third year in succession, stressed the importance to the smaller States of adopting plans for the joint administration of certain matters, particularlyjudicial and police arrangements, of which the efficient discharge might be foundbeyond their individual resources. Some progress in this matter has recentlybeen reported. The Viceroy also recommended that the conditions of service ofIndian States Forces, of which some 40 units are now being employed in India oroverseas with the Imperial Forces, should be brought as far as possible intoharmony with those obtaining in the Crown Forces on the Indian establishment.He drew attention to various ways in which the States had now been brought into consultation and had been accorded representation on bodies in India concernedwith the war effort, particularly the executive of the Eastern Group Conferenceon development of war resources.Conditions in the Indian States remain generally tranquil.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.22. General.The internal situation remains quiet.Pi-ess and Public Opinion.Nothing to report.23. Defence.Nothing to report,24. External Relations.Nothing to report.25. Economic Relations.(a) Internal. The price of Burma rice remains high on account of Japanesebuying.(b) External. During March the average number of lorries leaving andentering Burma by the China Road were 207 outwards and 200 inwards per day.Over 13,000 tons of goods were transported into China, mostly on Chinese govern-ment account.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &apos;&quot;&apos; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies inthe restricted sense, but also protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &apos;&apos; Colonial Governors &apos;&apos; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)26. Military A fairs.ia) United States Bases.By agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government, arrangements have been madefor additional United States Forces to be sent to Bermuda and Trinidad (andalso to Newfoundland) in view of the possibility of raids by surface naval vesselsagainst these territories. The forces for Bermuda arrived in the Colony on the20th April.(b) Ewopean Manpotver, West Africa.The question of making further use of European manpower in West Africafor military service has been under review and formed the subject of discussion at a recent meeting of the West African Governors&apos; Conference.   The General
Officer Commanding. West Africa, has been requested by the War Office to fillas high a proportion as possible of his requirements for white personnel locally inorder to avoid the despatch of men from the United Kingdom. On the otherhand, the commercial firms, who are the principal employers of Europeanpersonnel in West Africa, point out that their trading staffs have already beenreduced from the pre-war figure by approximately 30 per cent., the greater partof whom have joined the Forces; and, while anxious to co-operate to the best oftheir ability, they emphasise that it is difficult for them to release more men ontheir staffs. In particular requests for the release of varying numbers of men at short notice and at irregular intervals cause great difficulty. The chairman ofthe West African Governors&apos; Conference has been asked for his comments on the merchants&apos; representations, and in particular for his views whether, if anyfurther calls are to be made on the companies&apos; staffs, it would be practicable towork out some co-ordinated programme. The matter, however, also affectsGovernment staff, and this is receiving consideration.(c) Gibraltar.General Lord Gort. V.C., has been appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Gibraltar in place of Lieutenant-General Sir Clive Liddell.Sir C. Liddell has represented that some 4,000 civilians, of whom 2,200 aredockyard workers, would, in the event of Gibraltar being besieged, be unneces-sary to the defence and an embarrassment to the Military. He has asked for authority to evacuate these civilians as opportunity offers and their services canbe spared; the number which can be released immediately is about 500.*27. Disposal of Colonial Products.A detailed scheme of assistance to Palestine citrus growers has now beenagreed and announced in Parliament.Discussions are still proceeding for the formation of a pool to spread theburden of the surplus of copra over the whole Western4 Pacific area.Negotiations with Latin American cocoa producers for the introduction of import quotas in the United States market are being conducted through theUnited States Government.28. Miscellaneous.On the instructions of the Food Policy Committee the Colonial Office hascalled together a small Committee which is engaged in considering the produc-tion of food yeast and the desirability amongst other things of establishing itsmanufacture in one of the West Indian Colonies from sugar.Reports on Particular Colonies.29. Northern Rhodesia.Sir John Maybin. K.C.M.G., who had been Governor of Northern Rhodesiasince 1938. died suddenly at Lusaka on the 9th April.30. East A frica.The Governments of Kenya and Tanganyika have announced their intentionof introducing an excess profits tax and Uganda and Zanzibar have been encouraged to follow their example.31. Trinidad.As a result of a decision of the War Cabinet on the 17th April His Majesty&apos;representative at Caracas was authorised to inform the Venezuelan Governmentthat His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to conclude agreements at an earlydate for (i) the cession to Venezuela of the islet of Patos on the western side of thenorthern entrance to the Gulf of Paria;(ii) the division of the submarine areas of the Gulf of Paria to renderpossible the orderly exploitation of oil deposits which may be foundthere.* The War Cabinet authorised on the 5th May evacuation to this country in accordancewith the Governors proposals.
A condition of (i) is to be the continuance of the informal Venezuelan under-taking not to interfere with certain anti-submarine detector devices which havebeen laid across the northern entrances to the Gulf, in part in Venezuelan waters.An announcement was made on the 19th April, at the meeting of the VenezuelanCongress.32. Hong Kong.It has been proposed that the Government of the Colony should take overexisting reserves of rice stocks and assume monopoly of all rice imports and exports for the period of the war and possibly for a short transition periodthereafter.33. Sarawak.Important constitutional developments have taken place in the protectedState of Sarawak, where the Rajah has announced the end of the period ofautocratic rule which has lasted since the foundation of the State, and hasdirected the drafting of a Constitution providing for a representative legislature.The significance of these events in Sarawak is not fully clear at present, but theposition is being closely watched in view of His Majesty&apos;s Governments treatyrights in the State.34. Ceylon.The new Immigration Bill is still under discussion in the State Council.When passed by the Council, it will be &quot; reserved &quot; by the Governor for con-sideration by His Majesty&apos;? Government before His Majesty&apos;s assent is given andthe Bill becomes law. Meantime, the Minister of Local Administration.Mr. Bandaraniake. has been making various public utterances of a provocativecharacter, and a resolution was passed by his party to boycott the Governor. TheExecutive Committee of Local Administration, of which he is chairman, alsorecently decided to withhold their approval of contributions by local authoritiesto war funds until &quot; satisfactory &quot; legislation on the Indian immigrationquestion had been enacted. Under pressure from the Governor, the Minister isnow taking steps for the cancellation of the Executive Committee&apos;s decision aboutwar funds, and the Governor has called his attention to the objectionable natureof his reported public speeches.35. Aden Protectorate.There has been friction on the Aden Protectorate-Yemeni frontier owing toan incursion by some of the Humeidi tribe at a place called Dar-al-Beidha, justwithin the Subeihi border. Yemeni officials demanded the withdrawal of a smallpost of Government Guards posted in the district for defensive purposes. ThisAvas declined unless the Humeidis also withdrew. The Governor of Aden subse-quently reported that by agreement with the Yemeni Frontier Officer theHumeidis had left Dar-al-Beidha, that the Go\7ernment Guards had similarlybeen withdrawn, and discussions were proceeding.36. Cyprus.The military situation in Greece led the Greek King and Government to enquire whether, if forced to leave Greece, they could be established in Cyprus.It was recognised that, in view of the political movement in the island for union with Greece Avhich since the entry of Greece into the war has become increasinglyinfluential, the presence of the Greek King and Government would cause the cyprus Government grave embarrassment. But they Avere informed that, if they desired to go to Cyprus, they would be welcome in the island and everything possible Avould be done to assist them. They asked, hoAvever, that in that eventthey might be given in Cyprus an enclave to be regarded temporarily as Greeksoil, in which they could exercise jurisdiction. Strong objection is seen to suchan arrangement on various grounds. They are now being urged, if it becomes necessary for them to leave Crete, to go to Palestine, which is less vulnerable thanCyprus. Their presence in Palestine would cause no political difficulties, and theHigh Commissioner has reported that they could be accommodated there.
In view of the increased threat to Cyprus which results from the Balkancampaign, the garrison has been reinforced. The island is not, however, fortifiedand has not hitherto been provided with anti-aircraft guns.The Governor is reviewing the civil defence services in consultation with theMilitary authorities.37. Malta.During the latter part of April Malta was subjected to heavy air raids by night. The main street of Valletta has suffered severely, and there has beenextensive damage to property generally. Civilian casualties have fortunately beenslight. These raids have thrown a heavy burden on the Police and on civilian a.R.P. services, which are being strengthened.38. Mauritius and the Seychelles.These two Colonies have been providing troops for service in the pioneer corps in the Middle East. The services of these troops have proved satisfactory,and the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, has recently asked for a furthercontingent from each Colony. The Governors have reported that this demand canreadily be met.39. Palestine.There have been no political developments. Events in the Balkans, Cyrenaicaand Iraq had an unsettling effect on both the Arabs and the Jews, particularly thelatter, whose despondency on one or two occasions was almost as evident as duringthe period immediately after Dunkirk. Among both communities rumours wereprolific and often patently inspired with evil intent.Events in Iraq created less stir than might be expected among the Arabs,perhaps owing to the meagre information available, but the Mufti&apos;s supportersseized the opportunity to push him by spreading rumours that he was to be thenew Regent of Iraq. After prayers in the Harem Esh Sharif on the eve of theProphets birthday, cries in favour of the Mufti were raised and taken up bysections of the crowd; the incident did not, however, assume a serious aspect;it was clearly stage-managed by a few individuals, and most of those whoresponded were peasants from villages owned by members of the Husseini family.Arab recruitment continued on a moderate scale, but Jewish recruitmentdwindled still further. Lack of response among the Jews is attributable topropaganda by their official organisations in favour of Jewish &quot; National &quot;Forces.Jewish political activity has been reduced during the month under review,apparently as a result of the events in the Balkans and the Middle East. Thereis no evidence of a greater degree of unity among the Yishuv; Mr. Ben Gurioncontinues to appeal for it as a contribution to the war effort.Crime does not present any alarming features, although there was oneinstance of damage by a gang to the Iraq Petroleum Company pipeline, a formof lawlessness long absent. It is too early to say whether this was an isolatedincident or the beginning of organised sabotage. Three or four small gangsoperated, including one which held up the traffic on a main road in the late evening and another which was caught by the police, who shot one of the gang. There were three minor instances of damage to the frontier fence.The King of Yugoslavia and his Government have been established inPalestine since Yugoslavia was overrun by the enemy. (Prince Paul and his wifeare in Kenya under surveillance, and M. Stoyadinovitch is being sent toMauritius.)Transjordan remains normal.Great George Street, S.W.1,May 23, 1941.
