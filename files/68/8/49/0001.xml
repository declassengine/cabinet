A small expansion of home prdduction will be effected by the issue to curers of increased quantities of imported frozen carcases.    ^&quot;&quot;Tr(iii) Stoclcs suitable- for the ration arc forecast to fall to a. very low level in September. .-.
Fish; (i) Total supplies of fresh fish in June were approximately the same as in May.     A maximum price-order for most types of sea fish came into operation on 30th June,(ii) Pending control cf distribution, of canned fish,holders of stocks have been asked to restrictallocations and this is expected to reduce eonsumptito about 50f0 of the pre-war average,.Egr;s; (i) The Ministry became the sole purchaser of home produced eggs on 23rd June. In order to accumulateworking stocks no allocations were made in the first week of control.Cheese:(ii) During July-September supplies will be low becausehome production and imports from Eire will bedeclining and non-refrigerated shipments from canada and the U.S.A. will cease during the summer months,The average rate of consumption should be at least one egg per head per week,(i) Supplies from Canada are coming forward more rapidly than is provided for in the Ministry1s contract andall available quantities are being-shipped-from theU.S.A.(ii) The general ration was increased, from 1 02, to 2 ozs(on 30th June, and a further increase to 3 ozs.towards the end of August is proposed.The present level of milk consumption is greater than suppliesexpected in the winter months;    domestic consumption of condensed milkis being increased;   fresh fruit and vegetables are in short supply;releases of dried fruit are being increased.Fresh milk:condensed milk:Consumption in June was l6f0 greater than in June 1940.The present level of consumption requires more milk than is likely to be available in the winter months,     a rationing scheme which ensures adequate supplies forexpectant mothers, children and adolescents is underconsideration.- .       ..(i) Home production and imports cluring July-September arenot likely to be so large as had been anticipated.Stocks, however, are expected to be doubled betweenend-June and end-September,(ii) Releases for domestic consumption are to be increased in August from approximately 8 thousand tons to 12thousand tons a month.Fresh fruit &amp;   (i) Soft fruit is being diverted from the fresh fruitmarket into jam manufacture, Nearly 7 thousand tonsof oranges which arrived in June were distributed to areas which had suffered from air raids,(ii) Fresh vegetables were in rather short supply during june owing to the late season.Canned fruit &amp; It is intended to reserve s&apos;stocks of canned fruit...and vegetables for distribution during the winter.vegetables:vegetables:Jap.) andmarmalade:Dried fruit:Owing to the small fruit crop now expected., it is unlikGjthat a substantial reserve of pulp from home-grown fruican be built up.     All available fruit pulp is beingimported and will be used as a reserve for jammanufacturing,(i) /arrivals in June were.heavy and are expected, tocontinue at a high level in July and August,(ii) Increased releases in July and later months should nprevent the building up of total stocks and the la.jjt-are expected to reach about 60 thousand tons at end-
OTHER COMMODITIES

Tea: Arrivals were at a low level in June, being about two-thirds of consumption during that month. The seasonal decline in arrivals is expected to end in August and stocks should begin to increase.

Cocoa: Total stocks of raw cocoa beans rose from 71 thousand tons at end-May to 84 thousand tons at end-June and are likely to rise to a higher level in August.

Beer: Local shortages have been due to an apparent increase in demand and to transport difficulties rather than to any lack of brewing material.

Starch: Total stocks increased slightly in June but a decline is expected in July-August, owing to increased requirements for the manufacture of glucose.

ANIMAL FEEDING STUFFS

Forecast supplies of feeding stuffs are sufficient to meet livestock rations on the existing scale until the end of the summer rationing period. There should be a further expansion of oilcake stocks, which are forecast at 233 thousand tons at end-September 1941 as compared with 215 thousand tons at end-September 1940.

LEASE-LEND SUPPLIES

Requisition up to 19th July totalled 799,000 tons including 64,000 tons of dried beans, 43,000 tons of land, 54,000 tons of bacon, 121,000 tons of cheese, 113,000 tons of evaporated milk, 159,000 tons of dried fruit and 65,000 tons of fruit pulp. Shipments up to 19th July were 167,000 tons and the loading programme for August amounts to 243 thousand tons but it is unlikely that the latter figure will be realised.

V. DISTRIBUTION

Transport &amp; Warehousing: (i) There is a shortage of road transport due to the small number of new vehicles being released for civilian use, shortage of spare parts and reduced petrol supplies.

(ii) During June three new cold stores and one reconditioned store with a total capacity of 1.6 million cubic feet came into operation. A further 2.8 million cubic feet may be available by October to meet the peak demand for cold storage space.

Prices &amp; Price policy: (i) The index of retail food prices declined from 170 to 167 during June. The decline was due to reduced prices of fish, old potatoes and eggs.

(ii) During August it is proposed to increase the price of flour but to reduce bread prices by subsidy from an average of 8½d. per quartern to an average of 8d.

Rationed foods: (i) The changes during June were: (a) on June 9th offal was excluded from the meat ration and the minimum share scheme for preserves was converted into a rationing scheme; and (b) on June 30th the sugar ration was doubled for four weeks to allow for home jam making, the butter allowance was reduced to 2 ozs. and the general cheese ration was increased to 2 ozs.

(ii) Registration of consumers with retailers for eggs has been carried out but eggs are not yet rationed.

(iii) Retailers with less than 25 registrations for any food (except eggs for which 50 will not be issued with buying permits in the new rationing period. Food Executive Officers have discretion to review individual cases of hardship to the public or to retailers.

British Restaurants: At end-June there were 777 British Restaurants of all types in operation serving 167,000 meals per day as compared with 706 at end-May serving 148,000 meals per day.
