Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1941.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (R) (41) 58.WAR CABINET.REPORTS EOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST 1941 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.(1) General Position.CANADIAN opinion acclaimed the meeting between Mr. Churchill and president Roosevelt, as well as the message to Stalin, and the potentialities of anglo-American-Russian co-operation aroused much enthusiasm.Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s visit to London pleased his supporters and silenced,his critics.The Queen&apos;s speech was fully reported in the Press, and the visit of the duke of Kent had good publicity.Mr. Menzies&apos; resignation as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth ofAustralia aroused considerable interest, and much regret, in the Canadian Press.It raised the question of an Imperial War Cabinet, on which press comment was,however, cautious.In foreign affairs optimism was shown in regard to the maintenance ofRussian resistance, and there is now a strong feeling that Canada should giveactive aid to, and resume diplomatic relations with, the Soviet. Moreover, theidea that Russia is still &quot; on trial &quot; is being abandoned, and even the militantlyanti-Communist Action Catholique ridicules Hitler&apos;s pretensions to be waging areligious war against Russian paganism.Great satisfaction was expressed at the Allied initiative in Persia, and thereis a general feeling that ultimate victory is sure, but that it will not come quickly,and that a speed-up in Canadian production is essential. Canada&apos;s war efforthas recently been the subject of criticism in the United States Senate and press,and this has evoked in Canada a vigorous demand for a publicity campaign to counteract this criticism.Labour disputes are still given considerable attention in the Canadian press.Reports that Mexico, Cuba and some South American countries are proceeding against Nazi agents in those countries have been welcomed in Canada.Much prominence continues to be given to events in France. The attempt on the life of Laval was not discountenanced, and the French people, it is thought,only await a command to rise in rebellion. General de Gaulle&apos;s stock continuesto rise, and the Free French Movement is receiving a definitely better FrenchCanadian press. The appointment of a Canadian Consul at Saint Pierre-Miquelon is regarded as a wise move.At the meeting of the Canadian Institute of Public Relations, the lateProfessor Mowat. of Bristol University, advocated the political union of canada and the United States, a proposal which aroused considerable opposition,especially amongst the French Canadian delegates.[22941] b
The Canadian attitude towards Japan is reflected in the proposal to fill thepost of Canadian Minister to Tokyo (vacant since 1938, when the holder resignedowing to ill-health) only &quot; when the present critical position has been settled.&quot;The announcement of the establishment of the Supply, Priorities, andAllocations Board, in the United States has aroused demands for similarorganizations to be set up in Canada.(2) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Mr. Angus Macdonald, Minister for Naval Services, and Rear-AdmiralP. W. Nelles, Chief of the Naval Staff; visited London during August for discus-sions with the Admiralty. One result is that certain naval construction personnel are to be lent to the Canadian Government to help in destroyer construction.The strength of the Canadian Army in Canada in the middle of August was136,000 and of the Canadian Army overseas 86,107.In consultation with General McNaughton, the Commander and the maincombatant Units of the military force which carried out the operation againstSpitzbergen were found from Canadian troops iii the United Kingdom.In his speeches in this country Mr. Mackenzie King emphasised the fact thatCanadian Divisions are remaining in the United Kingdom because of the import-ance attached to its defence by the United Kingdom Government.Units and reinforcements for the 3rd Division left Canada at the end ofAugust for the United Kingdom. The infantry units of the 6th Division destined for service in Canada have already been mobilised.The Canadian and United States authorities are co-operating in investiga-tions of a possible ferry route via Labrador, Greenland and Iceland for aircraft,such as medium bombers and fighters, which cannot fly the Atlantic in one stage.(3) Economic Activities.Nil.COMMONWEALTH 0E AUSTRALIA.(4) General Position.Australian attention was monopolised during August by the political crisiswhich resulted in the resignation of Mr. Menzies, after he had renewed an appealto the Labour party, which they rejected, for the fprmatibn bf a National Govferh-ment, in which be would be willing to serve, and his own rejection Of the Labourparty demand that his Government should resign in their favour. The hew PrimeMinister, Mr. A. W. Faddeii, who is supported by the joint votes of the UnitedAustralia and Country parties, is a Queenslahder, 46 years old. He was theCommonwealth Treasurer and acted as Deputy Prime Minister duringMr. Menzies&apos; recent absence abroad. Mr. Faddeh&apos;s immediate task is thepreparation of the budget, and he is expected to carry oh with the present Ministry(in which Mr. Menzies serves as Minister of Defence and Cb-ordiiiation) untilthe budget is presented. Parliament meets again oh the 17th&apos; September.Mr. Menzies has not so far resigned the leadership of the United Australiaparty; The strength of the Government and Opposition parties is now exactlyequal at 36/36, with two Independent members, one of whom Has just left theUnited Australia party.The general press attitude towards, the new Prime Minister is one of &apos;&apos; tepidapproval.&quot; . Another crisis is expected at any moment, as Labour will almost certainly challenge the new budget., The Prime Minister expects td place theOpposition in a dilemma in this; as his new taxation proposals are supported bypast statements by Labour leaders. It is widely felt that an early general electionis inevitable;The entire press supported the proposal,that Mr. Menzies should go back toLondon, and go as Prime Minister; Originally this proposal was fostered ph theground that the Far Eastern situation had Been somewhat, mishandled. by theUnited Kingdom Government and that there was need: for ah Australian repre-sehtative in the United Kingdom War Cabinet; Questions on the extent to whichthe: Commonwealth Parliament would be bound by decisions taken in london by reason of the presence there of an&apos;Australian representative have, however,
been raised in the press. The line that has recently been taken by tb,e MelbourneHerald is that, although no &quot; right &quot; exists to &quot; representation &quot; in fjie UnitedKingdom War Cabinet, &quot; access &quot; tp that body should be available when matters are discussed and depisiqns taken affecting the safety of Australia. When itwas first proposed that Mr. Menzies shquld go tq London, the Labour partyshowed violent opposition, Mr. Curtin claiming that the Prime Minister, as such,could not be spared at the present junpture. &quot; We ask Britain to accept not therepresentative she chooses, but the representative the Australian Governmentchooses.&quot;It was found impossible to arrange a party truce with Labour during theabsence of an Australian representative in London, and in the end Mr. Menziesdeclined to take any further part in the suggestion that he should proceed again to London. Sir Earle Page, Commonwealth Minister of Commerce, has now been selected for this visit.Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s recent expression of satisfaction with the existing machinery for Empire consultation has drawn the comment that the position ofAustralia is quite different from that of Canada, which can look tq the UnitedStates of America for armed assistance if necessary.Meanwhile, the Brisbane Cayrier Mail has pointed qut that the first essential for a claim to an f&apos; equal voice &quot; for Australia is that there should be politicalunity at home.While the more responsible newspapers recognise the difficulties in the wayof Australian ministerial representation in London, most of the press too^ theline that Australian representation in the United Kingdom War Cabinet cannot reasonably be refused in view pf the Australian contribution tq the Empire war effort.Speaking qn the Australian war effort, Mr. Menzies, on the 25th August,stated that 400,000 persons were engaged in full-time or part-time war service,representing one in four pf the mq.\e population from 18 to 40 years pf age; while50,000 were directly engaged in the production of munitions. This year alonethe cost of the war to the country would be more -than the total cost of the war of 1914-18.The concern aroused by Japan/s aggressive intentions grew during the month,and the British-U.S.A declaration was prepeded by hints in the Australianpress that a concrete assurance on American Pacific polipy was overdue.The Vichy Government^ contemptible attitude over IndorChina, contrasted with its action in Syria, aroused resentment, and hppe was expressed thatany similar submission in the case of French North and West Africa would leadto a crisis in United States relations with Vichy.Amidst all the turmoil caused by the various party squabbles, the more responsible press has not failed to draw public attention to the dangers toAustralia inherent in the present Far East position. The A delaide A dvertiser,stressing these dangers, added &apos;&apos; we have dangerous external enemies already, andmay have more, but the enemies with whom we have ftpst to deal are thoseAustralians who insist on putting party before country, and who are so much morezealous as partisans than as. patriots.&quot;(5) Naval, Military and Air Activities.The total strengtli of the Royal Australian Navy is now 18,923.Mqre than 50 warships, including minesweepers, patrol vessels and Tribalclass destroyers are tq be built in Australia.Two 6-in. guns haye now been mounted at Noumea and the installation ofcoast defences at Darwin, Port Stephens (Newcastle), Sydney and Rabaul isprogressing satisfactorily.A.I.F. enlistments now total 171,575, of which 96,395 are serving overseas.The 27th Infantry Brigade Group of the 8th Australian Division and ancillary troops arrived at Singapore in August.One of the Australian brigades in Tobruk has been relieved by a PolishBrigade.MajorrGeneral Sir Ivan Mapkay has been appointed General Officer Com-manding-inrChief,  Australian  Home  Forces,   and  has  reached  Australia.Brigadier E. F. Herring has succeeded him as Major-General pqmmanding the[22941] b 2
6th Division of the A.I.F. General Mackay is reported to have emphasised thenecessity of providing adequate air support for the army in the Middle East, butpress reports that the Commonwealth Government had arranged independentlyfor a large allocation of aircraft to the Australian Forces are unfounded.Over 2,600 internees and prisoners of war reached Australia from the middle east during August.A.R.P. measures have been the subject of a conference between the Common-wealth and State Governments.NEW ZEALAND.(6) General Position.Parliament had adjourned before Mr. Fraser, the New Zealand PrimeMinister, left Wellington on his visit to the United Kingdom, but a specialthree-day secret session was held to discuss the Battle of Crete, on which occasionthere was considerable criticism from the extreme Left. The Deputy PrimeMinister, Mr. Nash, however, took a vigorous line, and had no difficulty incarrying the House with him.Before his departure, Mr. Fraser had offered to Mr. Holland, the Leader ofthe Opposition, a seat in the War Cabinet, accompanied by a request for apolitical truce during his absence. Mr. Holland declined the former while accepting the latter. The truce, however, was broken after only a few weeks,the failure of the medical profession to co-operate in the free medical servicesscheme of the Government providing the issue.The National (Opposition) Party considers that its chances in an electionhave improved, since recent local elections have gone steadily against theGovernment. The party have adopted the slogan &quot;National Government, no party politics, and get on with the war.&quot; As the party lacks outstanding leaders and a striking policy, its chances of success are probably not very rosy. The positionof the present Government, on the other hand, has been strengthened by the prosperity due to the war; and the enhanced prestige attaching to the PrimeMinister from his visit to London will stand them in good stead.Earlier in the month some pessimism was evinced about the prospect ofRussian resistance, but latterly this has given place to restrained optimism asRussia continued her magnificent effort. The Christchurch press provided a&apos;contrast to this view by condemning the complacency shown by some UnitedKingdom newspapers that we are secure against defeat, by pointing out that, if germany should win in Russia before the winter, victory &quot; as a whole&quot; maybe hers. Meetings organized throughout New Zealand to promote culturalrelations with the Soviet Union have come in for some criticism in the press,while the Roman Catholic papers continue their campaign against communism.Comments on other events in foreign affairs have taken the general lineshown by the United Kingdom press. References to possible United States/Japanese talks were deprecated, and the view was held that any concession to japan, despite the feeling that war was nearer, was to be avoided. Prominentreference was given to reports of Vichy-organized anti-British propaganda inthe United States. . The action in Persia was welcomed, though the WellingtonPost suggested that the move was primarily a Russian one. Turkey receivedscant sympathy in her difficulties, for which it is felt she was herself to blame.Mr. Churchill&apos;s broadcast about his meeting with President Roosevelt madea strong impression, and the meeting was widely featured in the press.Some newspapers quoted London reports advocating an Imperial War Cabinet,but the general opinion seems to be that Mr. Fraser would be more useful at homethan in London, were a crisis to develop in the Far East. The United KingdomMinistry of Information again came in for criticism on the score that, in contrast with copious German photographs, there was &quot;not a single picture&quot; to show the United States that this country is hitting back effectively.A Government bill to abolish flogging and to substituted imprisonment for life for the death penalty in the case of murder, was introduced into the NewZealand Parliament.
His Majesty has approved of the New Zealand Naval Forces, previouslyknown as the &quot;New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy,&quot; being entitled the&quot; Royal New Zealand Navy.&quot;The first composite minesweeper constructed in New Zealand has been launched at Auckland. Two more are to be launched during September.Preparatory work for building nine steel minesweepers has started.35,000 Territorials have received at least three months&apos; training since theoutbreak of war. The full war establishment of medium machine guns for theTerritorials is now in New Zealand.The New Zealand Home Guard has been reorganized as a military force under Army control. 50,000 men fit for combat duties are to be equipped withuniforms and trained. Some machine guns, Tommy guns and trench mortars will shortly be available.20,000 volunteers have been enrolled in the Women&apos;s War Service Auxiliary.Total Air Force personnel despatched overseas is 4,079, of whom 458 are forthe Fleet Air Arm.An aerodrome construction unit sailed for Malaya.(8) Economic Activities.Nil.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.(9) General Position.The Union Parliament is not expected to reassemble before the middle ofJanuary.As was foreshadowed in the last report, General Smuts has decided to propose to the Cabinet the suspension of the&quot; Provincial Council elections, since these would be likely to be fought at the present juncture on war rather than on purely provincial issues.In contrast with the bitter feud which has developed among the sections ofthe Opposition, the Government Coalition party continues to present anexemplary appearance of unity, and the Prime Minister had a great receptionat a recent party day meeting, at which a large crowd, which included manyBoer war veterans from the Eastern Transvaal, were present.The measures announced by the Minister of Finance to counter inflation and increases in the cost of living have had a good reception in the pro-Governmentpress, although it is suggested that these steps come too late to avoid the generalpayment of cost-ofdiving allowances, and that the excess profits tax would haveto be raised to 100 per cent. Even the Opposition press agreed that farmers should accept the warning not to buy land at speculative prices owing tonervousness about the future of money.A Commission has been appointed to examine the future of shipping in theUnion and it is possible that this may include the question of establishing ashipbuilding industry.Forum welcomed the prospect of the amalgamation of Northern and SouthernRhodesia with Nyasaland. Most other papers avoided the subject. The statement by the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia about subversive Afrikaner activity in the colony evoked a retort from the Transvaaler that the treatment of Unioncitizens in Southern Rhodesia had provoked this activity &quot;The day would come when Afrikaners would be in a position to do more for these people.&quot;The Natal Mercury looks forward to intense development of Africa afterhostilities have ceased. While Opposition papers strongly disagree withMrs. Smuts&apos;s view that the country will need immigrants after the war, theNatal Mercury urges the need of a revision of the present attitude towards thewhole question of assisted migration. In this connection there are signs thatthe Nationalists may make a stand against the immigration of all non-Europeansinto the Union. Professor Frankel, of the Witwatersrand University, has,however, stated that &quot; South Africa would have to prepare herself for greatchanges in her customary outlook and way of life. The chief problem was goingto be to prevent the relative stagnation of African economic development and it
would be solved only by finding the quickest means for unskilled native workers to play their part.&quot;Opposition activity has been mainly devoted during the month to striving,through the efforts of the Afrikaner Unity Committee, to compose the differences between the Nationalist Party and Ossewa Brandwag, which became intense whenthe latter issued a pamphlet containing a draft constitution for the &quot; comingRepublic.&quot; Dr. Malan, Leader of the Nationalist Party, demanded the with-drawal of this document and in this he has had the support of practically thewhole Opposition press. Ossewa Brandwag, while acknowledging nationalist party leadership and agreeing to withdraw the pamphlet, insisted on the rightof each organization to conduct its own propaganda for the republicanprogramme. With this was coupled a demand that Dr. Malan should publiclywithdraw his insinuations against Ossewa Brandwag. Meanwhile, the offendingpamphlet had caused divisions within Ossewa Brandwag itself, and the Chairmanof the organization^ Council resigned, owing to the defeat of his proposal thatthe Council should express itself against National Socialism. Mr. Eric Louw, a leading Nationalist M.P,, was suspended from membership of the ossewa brandwag for having indulged in destructive criticism of that party, while Mr. Pirow, whose New Order (which he reveals he discussed with Hitler,Mussolini and Franco) caused all the trouble, seems likely to be thrown out of theNationalist party at any moment. At present, Mr. Pirow has the support of18 M.Ps.The real issue between the Malan. Pirow and Ossewa Brandwag sections iswhich group of leaders is to be recognised as representative of the whole of&quot; United Afrikanerdom.&quot; Dr. Malan has the great advantage of the supportof all Nationalist papers, while Ossewa Brandwag has none. It is now thoughtthat Dr. Malan is determined to force a final &quot; show-down &quot;; that he will forceNationalists to resign from Ossewa Brandwag, and that, in conesquence, the&quot; rump &quot; of the Ossewa Brandwag and Pirow groups will make common cause for the New Party based on National Socialist principles.Meanwhile, some Government supporters are bringing pressure to bear toobtain the prosecution of Dr. Malan and other leading Nationalists, much to the embarrassment of the Minister of Justice, who has had to explain that there areno legal grounds for such action, and that prosecution would confer on Dr. Malanpolitical martyrdom.In foreign affairs the economic sanctions enforced by the Union against japan aroused opposition in the Nationalist press, which pointed to the cutting off of  5 million worth of Japanese imports (irreplaceable at present) and the consequent depletion of Union stocks.The Opposition papers also severely condemned the Government decision tosever relations with Finland.Inevitably, the Opposition has made sarcastic comparisons between the Anglo-Russian invasion of Persia and previous German and Russian invasions, andaffirms that the real question at issue is which Great Power is to rule the world.While the joint statement by the United Kingdom Prime Minister and thePresident of the United States of America was generally welcomed by the pro-Government press, there was an undercurrent of disappointment at continuedAmerican non-belligerence. The Opposition press is still nervous lest Simonstownshould ever be made available for the United States Navy.The pro-Government press are concerned to underline the importance of quickBritish and United States aid to Russia, and the Natal Witness urges a Britishoffensive, even on a large scale. The press generally is sceptical about general smuts&apos;s statement that land warfare may prove to be unnecessary.Pro-Government papers stress the folly of imagining that Russia will win the war for us.&quot;In Empire affairs the press generally has shown considerable interest in theAustralian political crisis, which has caused much press discussion over thequestion of Dominion representation in the United Kingdom War Cabinet;Friend suggests that the need is for a consultative body of outstanding repre-sentatives from all Dominions, while&apos;-the Natal Witness stresses that it is brainsthat are needed.Die Burger condemned British poverty and confusion of ideas, contrasted withHitler&apos;s powerful slogan of a &quot; New Order&quot; and described the &quot; punish theGermans&quot; aspect of Mr. Churchill&apos;s broadcast as   a gift to Goebbels.&quot;
SOUTHERN RHODESIA.(15) General Position,The Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia made a speech to the congress of the United Party in which he dealt with the question of the amalgamation ofNorthern and Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Sir Godfrey Hugginsexpressed dissatisfaction that it had not been possible to deal with this matteralready, and, in the course of his speech, remarked that Southern Rhodesia was&apos;&apos; not prepared to be put off in regard to amalgamation because that question might be difficult in the House of Commons and even cost votes outside. Theyhad no say in the election of the House of Commons, and therefore were notinterested in their reactions to Rhodesiah affairs.&quot; At a later stage he said that&quot; as a Minister of the Crown he could riot go to Colonial Office territories andraise the flag of revolt,&quot; but he suggested that Southern Rhodesia should paythe expenses of a convention which could be held in Southern Rhodesia, at whichdelegates from the three territories should draft a Constitution for the territories which &quot; should be sent to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom fortheir acceptance.&quot;The position is that after the outbreak of war further consideration of thequestion of amalgamation was deferred pending receipt of a report byLord Hailey on the possibility of co-ordinating native policy in the threeThe total strength of Union Forces is how 45,762 and hon-European Servicesamount to 52,757.The non-European personnel of the 2nd South African Division reachedEgypt in August.(11) Economic Activities.Nil.NEWFOUNDLAND.(12) General Position.The United States authorities are pushing on actively with the constructionof their new air and naval bases in Newfoundland.The Permanent Joint Defence Board of the United States and Canada has recommended that steps should be taken- to improve railway facilities in newfoundland for military use. Representatives of the United States DefenceSupply Corporation have visited St. John&apos;s, and, after discussion with them, the newfoundland Government agreed to accept rolling-stock costing $1,900^000(including five locomotives and 150 cars of various types) and to undertake other work costing $200,000. The Commission of Government are authorizing theissue of a loan of $2,100,000 United States at 2-^ per cent., repayable over15 years, the bonds being issued to the Corporation and the equipment remainingthe property of the Corporation till finally paid for and being liable to return incase of default.(13) Naval, Military and Air Activities.The 10th Contingent of R.A. recruits (37) and the 16th Contingent of R.N.recruits (105) arrived safely..Three hundred naval and thirty artillery recruits are at St. John&apos;s awaitingshipment.(14) Economic Activities.An Institute for British and Allied seamen has been opened at Corner Brook.Newfoundland seamen are continuing to join the Mercantile Marine, and batchesare being sent to the manning pool at Montreal from time to time.
territories. Lord Hailey&apos;s report (the conclusion of which is that there is a fundamental divergence in native policy between Southern Rhodesia and the other territories) has only just been received, and copies are being sent to SouthernEhodesia as soon as it has been put into print.(16) Naval, Military and Air Activities.The Southern Rhodesian Minister of Defence attended a conference atNairobi at the beginning of August which recommended the formation of an east African Command. The Major-General commanding the Northern Rhodesian and Nyasaland district of this Command is to act as military adviser to the Southern Rhodesian Government.EIRE.(17) General Position.There have been few developments in the political field in Eire since the speeches in the Dail reported in last month&apos;s summary on the subject of Eire&apos;sneutrality. In early August Senator MacDermot put down a motion that, &quot; inthe opinion of the Senate, the Government should take immediate steps to obtainthe full and effective co-operation of the United States Government in securingIreland against attack.&quot; This motion was subsequently withdrawn before discus-sion, because, as the Senator explained, it was represented to him by otherSenators, who agreed with the motion, that the aim which they had in mindwould not be furthered by public discussion of it. It was apparently feared that the Government would commit themselves to a statement which would makeit more difficult for them to move later. Senator MacDermot is now on a visit tothe United States, where, according to press reports, he has made a statementdeclaring that it is essential for the future of Ireland that Britain should not be defeated, and that the lack of naval and air bases in Ireland may just make thedifference between victory and defeat for Britain in the Battle of the Atlantic.The Irish Independent, the principal organ of Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s party, carriedan article on the 30th August containing the following passage :  &quot; Anybody in touch with public feeling in this country must be dis-disturbed by the cynicism, not unmixed with despair, which is so common atthe moment. There is danger that, having lost faith in those charged withmanaging the country&apos;s affairs, people may begin to lose faith in them-selves.&quot;The Irish Press, Mr. de Valera&apos;s paper, accused the Independent of trying to undermine the authority of those who are &quot; endeavouring to bring the countrysafely through the most dangerous emergency in its history,&quot; and charged theIndependent with the seeming ambition to become the organ of the native fifth column and to destroy the faith of the people in the Government.The general public in Eire are more concerned at the economic situation,and especially the supply position. Until recently the deterioration in the quality of bread as a result of the shortage of wheat and the rationing of tea to \ oz.per head were the ways in which shortage of supplies was most brought home to the ordinary man. At the end of August it was reported that a cargo of6,188 tons of wheat had been discharged in Dublin, the first wheat to reach Eiredirect from the United States for some months. It came in the first of thevessels purchased by the Irish Shipping Company created by the Eire Govern-ment for this purpose. This announcement came shortly after the Minister for agriculture had stated that this year&apos;s wheat crop in Eire was the largest since1846. The shortage of fuel and lighting oil has now taken the principal placeamong Eire&apos;s difficulties. The full effect of this shortage is not immediate, butthere is general fear as to what the position will be in the coming winter.Although every effort is being made to increase the production of turf in Eire,there seems no prospect that this will make up the expected deficiency in imported supplies.
INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.(18) Political Situation.1. The Congress Civil Disobedience movement shows less and less life.There is a pronounced lack of enthusiasm for it among members of Congressgenerally, but so far there is no sign of any change in Mr. Gandhi&apos;s attitude.2. There have been few outward signs of communal agitation, as is naturalduring the monsoon period. (Incidentally, a partial failure of the monsoon hasmade it probable that relief measures will be necessary in some provinces duringthe cold weather.)3. The measures announced in July for the expansion of the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council and the creation of a National Defence Council haveprovoked little active opposition from Hindus, but an unwelcome political crisishas resulted from Mr. Jinnah&apos;s resentment that his consent was not sought beforemembers of the Moslem League were invited and consented to serve on bothbodies, even though they had been invited ex officio, e.g.. the Premiers of Bengal,the Punjab and Assam. The Working Committee of the League has called onthe members to resign, under threat of disciplinary action. In the NationalDefence Council the Premiers of the Punjab and Assam have complied; thePremier of Bengal has deferred his decision. (The fourth Premier on the Council,the Chief Minister of Sind, is not a member of the League, and is determined to retain his seat.) Other Moslem League members on the National defence council have still to reveal their attitude, but Sir Sultan Ahmed has announcedthat he has no intention of resigning his seat on the Viceroy&apos;s Executive. Thesituation tends to be aggravated by the malicious pleasure shown in sections ofthe Hindu press.   The outcome of the crisis is still uncertain.4. Item III of the Atlantic Declaration has excited wide-spread interestand an authoritative statement is hoped for from His Majesty&apos;s Governmentdefining the bearing of the item on constitutional advance in India.5. There have been no outstanding manifestations of feeling in connexionwith the various developments in the war situation, apart from a tendency inMoslem circles to look with misgiving on Allied operations in Persia. This wasdisplayed in objectionable resolutions passed by the Working Committee of the moslem League, condemning &apos;&apos; unprovoked aggression&apos;&apos; in Persia and themilitary occupation of Moslem States in the Near East. The Government ofIndia have taken measures to prevent the publication of the resolutions.(19) Indian States.There is nothing of special importance to report. Morale continues to be generally good and confidence in ultimate British victory is maintained.(20) Military Affairs.The Indian forces in Iraq and Persia now amount to two Divisions plus oneBrigade Group and an Armoured component consisting of two ArmouredRegiments, one British and one Indian.His Majesty&apos;s Government have accepted India&apos;s offer of a further four divisions and one Armoured Division for service overseas in 1942, but the questionof the British element required for these Formations is still under consideraton.The Government of India have agreed to provide personnel for six coast defence batteries for service outside India.(21) Foreign and Frontier Relations.1. Afghanistan. In view of the Afghan Governments action which hasresulted in a decision by the Germans not to send Von Hentig to Kabul, it hasbeen decided to relax certain measures of economic pressure on Afghanistanpending further indications of the Afghan Governments general attitudetowards the German colony. The Government of India have, moreover, sent up[22941] c
experts required by the Afghan Government for the erection of a briquettingplant and for a coal survey, and are trying to find some road engineers for them.The Government of India are not, however, prepared to grant Afghanistan morefavourable treatment than India in respect of motor spirit; on which there is anall-round cut of 25 per cent., though they are willing, in view of their interestin the Afghan Air Force, to give further consideration to the possible withdrawalof the reduction in aviation spirit to Afghanistan if the Afghan Governmentparticularly press for this. At a recent interview the Charge d&apos;Affaires informed the Afghan Foreign Minister that His Majesty&apos;s Government had been soconcerned at their apparent determination to pursue an unfriendly policy towards us that they had been forced to consider what steps would be necessary for themto take to protect their interests; but that on receiving indications of a properspirit of neutrality, provided by the Afghan action to eliminate ; Von Hentig,they had deferred further consideration of the question. At the same time, he added, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot pretend satisfaction until the AfghanGovernment have taken effective action against the German colony. ; The ForeignMinister replied that his Government would be glad to learn that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment realised that they were in practice carrying out their declared policyof neutrality. He entirely repudiated the suggestion that they had been pursuing a policy in any wav unfriendly, and could not admit that the presence of &apos;alimited number of Germans (rather over 100) in the country was a breach of neutrality. The Afghan Government had taken steps to deal with activitiesdirected against His Majesty&apos;s Government and would be prepared to consideradditional measures if it could be shown that these were not adequate. But theremoval of the Germans was an entirely different matter and would be as harmfulto His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the Afghan Government itself, since it wouldbe interpreted by Afghan opinion as subserviency on the part of the AfghanGovernment to Great Britain. This might menace the stability of the AfghanGovernment and inflame public opinion against Great Britain.The question of the request by the Afghan Government for the withdrawalof Major Fletcher, the Publicity Officer to the Legation, was also discussed withthe Foreign Minister, who was informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government couldnot agree to the Afghan request, since they did not consider that the flimsynature of the charges made against him justified a request for his withdrawal.The Foreign Minister said that he regretted this decision, which he felt would further strain our already delicate relations; It is possible that Sir FrancisWylie, the new Minister, will be faced with a formal demand from the AfghanGovernment for Major Fletcher&apos;s withdrawal. The Afghan Government, whopreviously had only protested against publicity material being distributed bythe Legation, have now complained also about the distribution of Persian andPushtu magazines, picture papers, &amp;c, in the country. It was pointed out tothem that His Majesty&apos;s Government were not satisfied that German propagandahad been suppressed, as the Afghan Government have claimed, and that they must therefore take measures to protect themselves. But it is anticipated that the afghans will now endeavour to stop the circulation of propaganda materialentering Afghanistan across the Border.Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytler, the retiring Minister, vacated his appointment atKabul on the 13th August.The British and Soviet representations to Persia (Iran) have been the subjectof much comment and rumours of pressure on Afghanistan to allow the passageof troops and to remove Germans from the country are current. Events in theFar East are also being carefully watched. Prices of foodstuffs and importedarticles have risen in the last few months, and this may cause trouble for theAfghan Government. At present, however, the country is quiet and interest hasbeen centred in the Independence Celebrations.2. North-West Frontier. In North Waziristan the recalcitrant tribes inthe Tochi Valley have now made their submission and the troops are being with-drawn after completing selected demolitions in offending villages. SouthWaziristan remains steady. Generally, the situation both in Waziristan and inadjoining districts is unusually quiet. The Faqir of Ipi is reported to have lostmuch prestige. As regards public opinion, it is reported that, while in the&apos;Southern and Eastern Provinces of Afghanistan the tribes are still anti-Soviet,there is in South Waziristan a growing realisation of the heavy German losses inRussia and an increasing disbelief in German invincibility.

-experts required by the Afghan Government for the&apos; erection of a briquettingplant and for a coal survey, and are trying to find some road engineers for them.The Government of India are not, however, prepared to grant Afghanistan morefavourable treatment than India in respect of motor spirit, on which there is anall-round cut of 25 per cent., though they are willing, in view of their interestin the Afghan Air Force, to give further consideration to the possible withdrawalof the reduction in aviation spirit to Afghanistan if the Afghan Governmentparticularly press for this. At a recent interview the Charge d&apos;Affaires informed the Afghan Foreign Minister that His Majesty&apos;s Government had been soconcerned at their apparent determination to pursue an unfriendly policy towards us that they had been forced to consider what steps would be necessary for themto take to protect their interests; but that on receiving indications of a properspirit of neutrality, provided by the Afghan action to eliminate ; Von Hentig,they had deferred further consideration of the question. At the same time, he added, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot pretend satisfaction until the AfghanGovernment have taken effective action against the German colony.:! The ForeignMinister replied that his Government would be glad-to learn that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment realised that they were in practice carrying out their declared policyof neutrality. He entirely repudiated the suggestion that they had been pursuing a policy in any way unfriendly, and could not admit that the presence of &apos;alimited number of Germans (rather over 100) in the country was a breach of neutrality. The Afghan Government had taken steps to deal with activitiesdirected against His Majesty&apos;s Government and would be prepared to consideradditional measures if it could be shown that these were not adequate. But theremoval of the Germans was an entirely different matter and would be as harmfulto His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the Afghan Government itself,:since it wouldbe interpreted by Afghan opinion as subserviency on the part of the AfghanGovernment to Great Britain. This might menace the stability of the AfghanGovernment and inflame public opinion against Great Britain.The question of the request by the Afghan Government for the withdrawalof Major Fletcher, the Publicity Officer to the Legation, was also discussed withthe Foreign Minister, who was informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government couldnot agree to the Afghan request, since they did not consider that the flimsynature of the charges made against him justified a request for his&apos; withdrawal.The Foreign Minister said that he regretted this decision, Which he&apos; felt would further strain our already delicate relations-. It is possible that Sir FrancisWylie, the new Minister, will be faced with a formal demand from the AfghanGovernment for Major Fletcher&apos;s withdrawal. The Afghan Government, whopreviously had only protested against publicity1 material being distributed bythe Legation, have now complained also about the distribution of Persian andPushtu magazines, picture papers, &amp;c, in the country. It was pointed out tothem that His Majesty&apos;s Government were not satisfied that German propagandahad been suppressed, as the Afghan Government have claimed, and that they must therefore take measures to protect themselves. But it is anticipated that the afghans will now endeavour to stop the circulation of propaganda materialentering Afghanistan across the Border.Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytler, the retiring Minister, vacated his appointment atKabul on the 13th August.The British and Soviet representations to Persia (Iran) have been the subjectof much comment and rumours of pressure on Afghanistan to allow the passageof troops and to remove Germans from the country are current. Events in theFar East are also being carefully watched. Prices of foodstuffs and importedarticles have risen in the last few months, and this may cause trouble for theAfghan Government. At present, however, the country is quiet and interest hasbeen centred in the Independence Celebrations.2. North- West Frontier. In North Waziristan the recalcitrant tribes inthe Tochi Valley have now made their submission and the troops are being with-drawn after completing selected demolitions in offending villages. SouthWaziristan remains steady. Generally, the situation both in Waziristan and inadjoining districts is unusually quiet. The Faqir of Ipi is reported to have lostmuch prestige. As regards public opinion, it is reported that, while in theSouthern&apos; and Eastern Provinces of Afghanistan the tribes are still anti-Soviet,there is in South Waziristan a growing realisation of the heavy German losses inRussia and an increasing disbelief in German invincibility.
BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.(23) General.The country generally is quiet.There are signs that the non-Communist members of the Thakin (NationalistYouth) party are inclined to co-operate with the Government, as they are intenselysuspicious of Japanese designs. On the other hand, there are indications of japanese fifth column activity among the extreme elements of this party.A proposal made by U Saw, the Premier, that he should come to this country as soon as convenient, ostensibly to convey a message of goodwill from the Govern-ment and people of Burma, has been accepted.

In this report &apos;&apos; Colonies &apos;&apos; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)(25) Economic A fairs.(1) Supply of Colonial Requirements from the United States.The Head of the Economic Department of the Colonial Office has now returned from Washington, but a Principal of that Department is remaining inthe United States as Colonial Supply Liaison Officer.(2) Japan.Following the freezing of Japanese assets, Colonial Governments have been directed to cancel all existing export licences for Japan. Moreover, in order to implement the policy of restricting trade with Japan to the barest essentials, theyhave also been instructed to refer all future applications for import and export licences to this country.(3) Import Licensing.A conference was held in Jamaica to discuss the tightening up andco-ordination of import control in the West Indian area. A full report is awaited.[22941] DPetrol Rationing in India. Rationing of petrol was introduced in India onthe 15th August. The scheme is designed to effect an immediate cut of 25 percent, in civil consumption. It is intended that imports should remain on a normalscale and that the savings should be used to build up stocks for military purposes.
(4) Rubber.In order to ensure the highest possible production of rubber from the signa-tory countries, the International Rubber Regulation Committee at their meetingon the 19th August fixed 120 per cent, as the quota for the last quarter of thecurrent year. This quota will enable the maximum productive capacity of the rubber-bearing areas in the East- British and Dutch to be fully utilised.(5) Sisal.An offer has recently been made for sale to the United States of a stock pileof 40,000 tons of sisal. Under agreement between the parties, 23,000 tons were offered by British East Africa and 17,000 by the Netherlands East Indies. no reply has been received to this offer yet.(26) Defence.Security arrangements in West Africa have recently been strengthened inconsultation with the appropriate Departments, and arrangements have been madefor the despatch of Field Security Sections to the seaports and airports of allfour Colonies, and for the co-ordination of their activities. In addition, other officers have been sent to West Africa to advise the local Governments on various aspects of security, and the whole question has been reviewed by the Home DefenceSecurity Executive, whose recommendations have been sent to the Governors for appropriate action.Reports on Particular Colonies.(27) West Indies.Mr. George Hall, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, accompanied byhis Parliamentary Private Secretary and his Private Secretary, left England by air on the 21st August on a short visit to the West Indies. He is visiting the bahamas, Barbados, Jamaica, British Guiana and Trinidad.(28) British Honduras.At the request of the Ministry of Supply, British Honduras has raised a self-contained Forestry Unit for service in the United Kingdom. The Unit ismore than 500 strong, and the first detachment of over 100 men arrived in scotland on the 22nd August.  The remainder are on their way.(29) Palestine.During August there were no developments or activities in Arab politics, butthere was much speculation about rumours that the Government intends toappoint a President of the Supreme Moslem Council. This is partly the result ofthe Mufti&apos;s further flight and the growing conviction that he is finished as far asHis Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned, and partly due to the initiative of theDefence party, who have made periodic attempts to force this issue from 1937onwards.Public interest in the future of Syria continues. Amongst the Arabs there is increased impatience, coupled with scepticism, regarding Allied intentions.Infiltration into Syria of Jews from Palestine, largely, if not extensively,organised by the Agency&apos;s satellite organisations, is on a considerable scale.Jewish opposition to the proposed labour dispute legislation is now showingsigns of anaemia, despite periodic stimulation by Left political bodies. the citizens&apos; Bloc and certain minor labour organisations have come out in favour ofthis legislation mainly, it must be conceded, because of Left opposition to it.The terrorist campaign by the Irgun, a Right Wing Jewist terrorist organi-sation, which was mentioned in the report for July, continued unabated, and it became evident that the Revisionist Party Executive were fully aware of whatwas going on. On the night of the 31st July-lst August Irgun gangsters believed to have been involved in intimidation in the Tel Aviv-Petah Tiqva area were arrested, and on the 1st August the Revisionist Executive was summoned to an interview with the Chief Secretary. He informed them that the Governmentwas well aware of their knowledge of acts of terrorism, which constituted a threat to security and a deliberate flouting of lawful authority, and that, unless those
acts ceased forthwith, the Government would have no alternative to the detention of responsible Revisionist leaders. The terrorist campaign continued sporadicallyfor another week, when it was stopped by the Revisionist leaders. The presentlull does not, however, mean that the Irgun has thrown in the sponge, but is abreathing space to give the Revisionists time to take Governments measure.(30) Aden Protectorate.No further reports have been received with regard to the Dar-el-Beidhaincident, which appears, for the present at any rate, to be closed.. , A satisfactory consequence of the recent deposition of the Fadhli Sultanhas been the conclusion of an agreement between his successor and his neighbour,the Lower Yafai Sultan, regarding the district of Abyan, which has been a boneof contention between these two tribes for many years. If this agreement ismaintained, it should assist materially in the efforts that are being made toimprove the conditions of this potentially fertile area. To the north-east of theFadhli country the Government Agricultural Officer has met with considerable success in his experiments on the Audhali plateau, which is at a height of about,000 feet, and most of which can be cultivated and made productive. The roadconnecting this plateau with Aden passes through the Fadhli country, and betterarrangements for its control are another satisfactory result of the removal ofthe former Fadhli Sultan.Mr. Ingrams, the Chief Secretary, who has recently returned from a visit to Sana, has reported an improved and more friendly atmosphere in the Yemen.This is no doubt partly attributable to the decline in Italian influence in the yemen, consequent on Italian defeats in North-East Africa.(31) Ceylon.It has now been definitely decided that discussions between representativesof the Government of India and the Ceylon Government on the subject of indians in Ceylon shall be reopened at Colombo at the beginning of September.In last month&apos;s report I said that I had again suggested to the Governorthat a suitably-phrased statement should be issued to the effect that, while HisMajesty&apos;s Government wish to promote the reform of the Constitution as soonas possible, they are unable to proceed with the matter during the war. TheGovernor has now agreed that such a statement should be issued.(32) Malaya.The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia have decided to appoint an official representative at Singapore to exercise functions covering politicalintelligence information, commercial and administrative matters. This step hasbeen considered essential in view of the great significance of Australia^ interestsin the Malayan nd it is proposed to appoint the present commonwealth trade Commissioner at Shanghai to the post.Representations have been received from rubber-planting interests in thiscountry that, in view of the importance of rubber production to the war effort, andthe desirability of maintaining adequate estate staff to maintain good relationswith the workers, planting should be made a &quot; reserved occupation &quot; in Malaya.In the view of the Malayan authorities, it would not be possible, if planters areexempted from service with the Local Volunteer Forces, for these forces to function in the Federated Malay States, Johore or Kedah, since many of their officers are planters. Applications for individual exemptions, however, are carefully considered and, wherever possible, granted, with the consent of themilitary authorities.The&quot; Rajah of Sarawak is introducing a new Constitution in this centenaryyear of the State&apos;s independence under the rule of the Brookes. It is understoodthat he is now willing to accept a British representative in Sarawak.(33) Hong Kong&apos;. -The Governor, Sir Geoffrey Northcote, is retiring on grounds of health. his successor, Sir Mark Young, will assume the government of the Colony very shortly.
