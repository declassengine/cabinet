(R) (W) I3-February 17, 1941.Copy No.   51WAR CABINET.IMPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY, 1941, FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES, PROTEC-TORATES AND MANDATED TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.1. General Position.THE chief political event of the month in Canada has been the abortiveconference between provincial and federal politicians, held to discuss future policy on the basis of the Sirois Report on Dominion-Provincial relations; themain point raised by the report was a closer control by the Dominion authoritiesover Provincial and municipal finances. As reported in the press, the conferencebroke up almost as soon as it had begun, in an atmosphere of mutual recrimination,he one basis of general agreement seeming to have been the more active)rosecution of the war. The fiasco was particularly unfortunate in that publicopinion was said to have been generally favourable to the report; indeed, a polltaken by the Canadian Chambers of Commerce showed there were no adverse votesin any Province. Some Canadian newspapers believe that a second conference will be called in a few months&apos; time.Comment by Canadian newspapers on the world situation shows little difference from that exhibited in this country; thus, criticism of Mr. de Valeralias been severe in all papers, even among those supported by the Irish Canadians,jj Comment on Italy in French vernacular papers has recently been acrid, especially[after the Christmas bombardment of Corfu. Mr. J. B. Priestley&apos;s broadcastsifi&apos;om England, and Sir Walter Citrine&apos;s speeches in Canada, have beenlexceptionally well received.The Canadian attitude to the United States remains what it has traditionallyIbeen; thus, although Mr. roosevelt&apos;s last speech was widely ^welcomed, there wasla taint undercurrent of anxiety that the economic interests of Canada mightIpe swamped by the new activity of her powerful neighbour. The progress ofI, !; Roosevelt&apos;s &quot; Lease and Lend &quot; Bill is being watched with great interest.I - he great event is the rapid and decisive rapprochement between the two[Anglo-Saxon democracies.&quot;2. Naval, Military and Air Activities.Mr. Mackenzie King has announced that the Canadian Army programmejrovides for the despatch of the following units overseas :   (a) the balance of&apos;01&apos;PS troops for the 2 Divisions now in the United Kingdom, (6) an Army Tank[22232] b
Brigade for employment with the Canadian Corps, (c) a 3rd Canadian Divisionwith complement of corps troops, and (d) a Canadian Armoured Division. he added that the present strength of the Royal Canadian Air Force (36.000 men)would l)e doubled.The Canadian Government have appointed Commodore L. W. Murray.R.C.N.. to command the eight Canadian destroyers (including two ex-UnitedStates) now at the disposal of the Admiralty in Home Waters.Mr. Ralston. Minister of -National Defence, Mr. Howe, Minister of munitions and Supply, and Air Vice-Marshal Breadner, Chief of the Air Staff, have returned to Canada from their visits to the United Kingdom.In a broadcast address on the 2nd February Mr. Mackenzie King stated thatthe Canadian Government had considered the reports by Mr. Ralston andMr. Howe and he summarised the Canadian Defence Programme for 1941, which,he said, was timed to fit into the United Kingdom programme. The programmeinvolves rapid Navy expansion, the despatch of further military forces overseasthe doubling of the R.C.A.F. and a vast increase in the production of war equip,ment and supplies.(3) Economic A activities.Nothing of importance to record.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.4. General Position.There has been no political event of major importance, either internally orexternally, in the last month in Australia. The political truce may in part bedue to tlie departure of the Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, for conversations inLondon. Mr. Menzies&apos; visit meets with general approval. The general attiludetowards the war still seems to be somewhat languid. Although criticism of theUnited Kingdom effort frequently appears in the Commonwealth press, the more responsible papers also do not spare their criticism of examples of slackness inthe local war effort, exhibited by the leakage of shipping information, the poorpublic response to the war loan recently floated, and the insignificant effects of petrol rationing.The most important example of the general feeling appears to have been theban on overtime recently imposed by the Sydney Boiler Makers and Iron Workers.This action has been severely criticized by the press. The Commonwealth Govern-ment has taken powers under the National Security regulations to deal withsubversive statements.Considerable agitation has been aroused by the statement made by theMinister for External Affairs in regard to Japan that &quot; relations between japan and Australia are cordial despite the unavoidable trade and financial restrictionscaused by the war.&quot; One influential newspaper stated that &quot;We cannot havecordial relations with a nation which has only recently signed a military alliance with our sworn enemies.&quot; The impression created by this announcement has,however, been offset to a certain extent by general approval of the firm and tactfulspeech made by Sir John Latham, the recently appointed Australian Minister to japan, on his arrival in Tokyo.The statement by the Minister for Shipping on shipping losses has provided the text for numerous articles in the press urging the establishment of an australian shipbuilding industry.5. Naval. Military and Air Activities.Mr. Menzies, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, isto arrive in this country on a short visit in the middle of February.  Mr. MenziesNvishes to discuss various aspects of the Australian war effort, in particular. pw*affecting the Navy, Army and Air Force and the provision of military supplies on his way to this country, Mr. Menzies has been visiting Egypt and Palestine.
tieZeGetheofawMinesweeping operations have continued in the Bass Straits and one mine; il0en exploded in the approaches to Hobart. A modified system of convoys, been introduced in the Tasma.ii Sea.a number of officers and men of the Royal Australian Naval Volunteerserve have arrived in this country for service with the Royal Navy.The Commonwealth Government are arranging for the installation of coastonce guns on Ocean Island and Nauru, and are in consultation with the NewiLiiuf Government as to the provision of personnel for manning the guns.The Commonwealth Minister for the Army and the Australian Chief of theneral Staff recently visited the Middle East and inspected Australian unitsre.The Commonwealth Government have approved the immediate formationthe initial units of an armoured division comprising two armoured brigadesa support group.6. Economic Activities.The Commonwealth Government have approved the proposal of the recentnference at Delhi that an Eastern Group Supply Council should be set up, andhave appointed as their Representative on the Council Sir Bertram Stevens,formerly Premier of New South Wales.The Commonwealth Government report that satisfactory progress has beennade with the design of cruiser tanks in Australia and that production isexpected to begin in August 1941.The Commonwealth Government imposed further restrictions on importsnun non-sterling countries as from the 1st January.Exports of Australian primary products to the United Kingdom are likelyo be severely restricted in the immediate future owing to increased shippingiilieulties, and this may give rise to some difficult &quot; surplus&quot; problems in theominon wealth.NEW  ZEALAND.   .7. General Position.There is very little to report from New Zealand during January. opinon as been perhaps most deeply stirred b)r recent shipping losses in the Pacific, andinplaints have been made of New Zealand&apos;s lack of coastal reconnaissancelanes. Considerable anxiety also appears to be felt about the position of theominions generally in the post-war world, particularly with regard to Newealand&apos;s overseas trade. In this connection public opinion is disturbed over theiminution of New Zealand meat supplies to the United Kingdom, not only frome point of view of the war as a whole, but also from that of New Zealand as aeat exporting country.Tn foreign affairs the attention of New Zealand is as present mainly fixedthe Far &quot;East, where it is felt that there is no cause for anxiety as yet; and one American &quot; Lease and Lend &quot; Bill.   The general tone of the Dominion pressregard to the progress of the war is cautious, but there is entire belief in antimate British victory.Mr. W. H. Donald (an Australian who is adviser to General Chiangai-shek) paid a visit to Auckland during the month, and in the course of a pressterview expressed confidence in the victory of China, and criticised the openingan Australian Legation at Tokyo.8. Naval, Military and Air Activities.he New Zealand Government are arranging to second personnel to assist inie defence of Tonga, and will also supply certain equipment required.1 he Chief of the New Zealand General Staff recently visited the Middle East.9. Economic Activities.1 he New Zealand Government have approved the proposal to establish ann Group Supply Council, and are arranging to appoint a representative onCouncil.L22232]B 2
10. General Position.The internal political position of the Union continues to be as agitated asever. Participation in the war is still the main theme of contention, and the resumed session of the Union Parliament has given fresh indications of theviolently partisan and diametrically opposed policies of the various factionsstruggling for power. In face of the Opposition^ -non possumus attitude, theposition of General Smuts and the Government is being continually strengthened,both on account of the divisions among their opponents, and also owing to the developments of the war, which even Opposition newspapers are compelled to acknowledge have lately been taking a turn more favourable to the British cause.The latent dissension has very recently flared up into ugly clashes between soldiersand members of the &quot; Ossewa Brandwag &quot; and also those members of the police force who have not accepted military service beyond the Union borders.Although the soldiers suffered much provocation, General Smuts has issued anorder roundly condemning the &quot; riotous conduct of certain members of theforces,&quot; on the occasion in question, and has threatened severe disciplinary action.The Ossewa Brandwag is an extreme nationalist organization. It recentlyappointed as its Commandant Dr. Van Rensburg, formerly administrator of the orange Free State. Dr. Van Rensburg is thought to be much under the influence of Nazi ideas, but the Organisation was stated recently to have abandoned its policy of declaring for a republic under German protection in favour of along-term programme of peaceful penetration in the Union.The recent occurrences are unfortunate, and may prove inconvenient for theGovernment, but the existence of the Ossewa Brandwag constitutes an equalproblem for the Nationalist groups. The latter&apos;s difficulties have not beenlessened by the action of the supporters of General Hertzog in founding the&quot; Afrikaner Union Party &quot; under the leadership of General Conroy. this group is so far made up of ten Members of Parliament and five Senators, and itis believed to be opposed to continued participation in the war.The Government has been attacked in Parliament by the Opposition over theadditional appropriation of  14 million, which brings the war expenditure forthe year up to  60 million.Press comments on affairs outside the Union follow the usual party lines.The Government press have naturally made much of the British victories in north africa. They have continued to criticize Mr. de Valera, and have noted with satisfaction the new Royal Air Force policy of advancing the air frontier. Theysupport the imposition of industrial conscription and the suppression of the daily Worker, and have been cautiously optimistic about the decrease in-shipping losses in the Atlantic. The Opposition press contrast the Reuter report5of German bombs on Eire with their reports of British bombs on Switzerland,they have commented on inflationary tendencies in the United Kingdom and onthe illogical attitude said to have been adopted by Dr. van Broekhui-zen (UnionMinister to the Netherlands) in supporting Eire&apos;s neutrality and opposing thatof the Union. They have protested at the &quot; shameless breach &quot; of the under-taking given by the Union Government in September 1939, represented by thepublication of news that Union minesweepers are now serving in Northern waters,and have made some play with the adverse effect of the war on the financialposition of the Union as illustrated by the difficulties in the way of exportingagricultural produce.A National Security Code for the Union and South-West Africa, providingdrastic penalties for the circulation of subversive statements, undesirableactivities, unauthorised drilling or exercises of a military nature, &amp;c., waspromulgated on the 4th February.(11) Naval, Military and Air Activities.The total strength of the Union forces is 108,000 all ranks; of these, 98.000are on full-time service and 33,000 are in Kenya.General Smuts recently offered to send a 2nd Union Division (motorised) to east Africa. The offer has been accepted, and detailed plans for the move arenow under examination.   In connection with this move General Smuts has
expressed his anxiety at the poor state of the road through Northern RhodesiaVrul Tanganyika to Kenya. He is anxious that the road should be made an\\\-weather route, capable of carrying the greater part of the mechanical transport required for the 2nd Division. He has suggested that Italian prisonerswar should be employed on the road, and this suggestion is under examination.12. Economic.The Union Government have approved the formation of an Eastern GroupSupply Council, and have appointed a representative to serve on the Council.EIRE.13. General Position.There has been little change in the relations between the United Kingdomand Eire since the last report was written. No further reports have been received of bombs being dropped on Eire territory or of Eire ships being sunk, and publicopinion in Eire is coming to the conclusion that the bombings of late december and early January were either a mistake or intended as a warning by Germanyno! to make concessions to the United Kingdom. There have been further casesof United Kingdom aircraft making forced landings in Eire territory and theircrews being interned.It is too early yet to estimate the full effects of the operation of the Board ofTrade Order subjecting most exports from tJhis country to Eire to licensingrequirements as this did not come into force until the 20th January. The supplyquestion has, however, been much canvassed in Eire recently and formed thesubject of a special two days&apos; meeting of the Dail. Mr. de Valera subsequently,on the 29th January, broadcast an address to the people of Eire, in which be referred to Eire&apos;s dependence for her imports on shipping which was not her own and went on : &quot; The belligerents in blockading each other are blockading us.How far directly and how far indirectly, how far designedly and how farundesignedly, we need not wait to estimate. The results are the same and theyare serious.&quot; He appealed for the growing of more wheat, potatoes and cattlefeeding stuffs and the conservation of coal and petrol supplies. Tea, he announced,would be rationed.Arrangements are being made to supply Eire with petrol at the rate ofapproximately 50 per cent, of her pre-war consumption. The cut in consumptionm this country is roughly 33^- per cent.It is understood that the Eire Government, who have unsuccessfully been pressing the Treasury here to provide them with dollars for their purchases inthe United States, are now seeking a dollar loan in that country for the purchaseof ships, arms, &amp;c.The Eire Government have agreed to a request made by Sir John Maffey, atthe instance of the Air Ministry, to acquiesce in military flying boats operating from Lough Erne flying over a corridor of Eire territory and territorial waters to the sea. The Eire Government have also agreed to a request made again atthe instance of the Air Ministry to permit civil flying boats for Lisbon, WestAfrica and America to alight at Foynes, thus enabling a greatly increased payoad to be carried. The Eire Government have made consent to the latter requestconditional upon our very occasionally giving a seat to the Eire Government forjan official passenger and more frequently taking a small mail bag. It is under-jstood that the Censorship Department and the Ministry of Economic Warfarejsee objection to the latter conditions, and the matter is still under consideration.On the 4th February Mr. Willkie paid a flying visit to Eire and had a longInterview with Mr. de Valera. Mr. Willkie told the United States Minister inpuhlln that he had given Mr. de Valera &quot; one or two jolts.&quot;NEWFOUNDLAND.14. General Position.It Mi&apos;. J. H. Penson, M.C., Commissioner for Finance, and Mr. L. E.Ipmersou, K.C., Commissioner for Justice, arrived in the United Kingdom on the
24th January to take part in the discussions now in progress with the UnitedStates delegates in connection with the lease of naval and air bases in newfoundland to the United States of America. The Newfoundland newspapershave been voicing a demand for some financial or economic concessions from theUnited States in return for the lease of bases, and the Newfoundland Board ofTrade have passed a resolution supporting this demand. United StatesContractors are now starting clearing operations at Argentia and a shipconveying United States troops has reached St. John&apos;s, where it will moor in the harbour.The payment in full of the interest on the Newfoundland public debt onthe 31st December, without assistance from United Kingdom funds, has promptedthe leading papers to raise the question of the desirability of the early establish-ment of a more liberal form of constitution.15. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.Owing to lack of transport no Newfoundland recruits for the 57th Regiment,Royal Artillery, or for the Royal Navy were able to sail during January.-   16. Economic A ciirdties.An agreement of importance to the Newfoundland seal fishery was reached with the Treasury and other authorities concerned. Licences will be issued during1941 for the import of 150,000 sealskins into the United Kingdom, subject to thecondition that the skins will be utilised solely for re-export, and arrangements have also been made covering the other seal products. It is hoped that this willenable the fishery to be continued in the spring, a point on which there was previously some doubt.SOUTH ERN   RHO DESI A.[17. Nothing of importance to report.]INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.18. General.Political Situation.No noteworthy change in the political situation has occurred during January.The so-called &quot; second phase &quot; of Gandhi&apos;s anti-war publicity campaign, thegeneral idea of which was that every day one candidate for arrest should presenthimself in every district throughout India, the candidates being necessarily on a lower plane of prominence than those whose activities constituted the &quot;firstphase,&quot; started on the 6th January and continued more or less according to planthroughout the month.   The technique is that each intended victim gives noticeof his intention to recite in public anti-war slogans at a certain time and place:but owing to the practice now common of arresting the individual as soon as hehas announced his intention and thereby depriving him of the publicity he seekfor his ceremonial breach of the law, the tendency of candidates has been to go into hiding after announcing their intentions.   The &quot;first phase&quot; involved the conviction and imprisonment of 635 persons; the &quot; second phase &quot; up to the endof the month had led to the conviction of some 1,515 persons in addition.  Mostof these have been convicted and sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment. Ibut in one Province only fines have been inflicted, and there and elsewhere offences Iby individuals of no standing have been ignored both of which expedient; 1appear to have caused some annoyance.   The Government of India reported a: Ithe end of the month that so far the &quot; second phase &quot; of the movement has led Eto no general increase of popular feeling and no great enthusiasm on the par: Iof Congressmen themselves, though there is some reason for supposing that &apos;Mconviction in the course of this campaign is regarded as likely to prove a valuable jasset to candidates at the next general elections whenever these take place. I&quot;lone or two places arrests have given rise to slight disturbances.There is nothing to report with regard to the deadlock over constitutionalMdemands.
19. Military Affairs.1.   In addition to the two Indian State Force Infantry Battalions forJuards and Internal Security duties in the Middle East which were due to leave;1 at the end of January, the Government of India have now arranged ton-h a third Indian States Forces Battalion for the same duties in February,2.   The Government of India have agreed to provide 21 Labour Companies,i&apos; which one was to be despatched to Malaya in January and the remaining 20i-o for the Middle East.   Of the latter, two were to be despatched in Januaryml four in February.   India has been warned that a further 36 companies for he Middle East may be required.3. It has now been decided that the division to be available from India inlav 1941 will go to Malaya. The Government of India have now agreed toceelerate the despatch of this division to Malaya. Subject to shipping beingrraneed, it is expected that the first brigade will reach Malaya in February andhat the move should be completed by April.4. The Government of India have also agreed to send two squadrons R.A.F.rom India to Malaya in February.5. An Infantry brigade and 2 Mountain batteries are being sent from india reinforce Burma. The force should leave in February and is being replacedi India by new units which are being raised.20. Foreign and Frontier Relations.a) Afghanistan.The British Minister has recently had interviews with the Afghan Primelinister, who was very cordial but would discuss world affairs only, and withle Afghan Foreign Minister, with whom matters of current interest wereiscussed. This opportunity was taken for a straight talk on such matters asGorman propaganda, the employment of Germans.on economic development, theI-eatment of British publicity, and the apparent unwillingness of&apos;the AfghanEovernment to come into the open in accepting offers of economic assistanceIroni His Majesty&apos;s Government. The attitude of the Foreign Minister, thoughiery friendly, was not altogether satisfactory. No satisfaction was obtained onBio question of the limitation of the issue of the Legation Bulletin, and theAfghan Government are unable to accept certain of the conditions laid down byHis Majesty&apos;s Government for the grant of credits. The Foreign Minister,jowover. declared that the Afghan Government had ho intention of changingfiieir policy of close friendship with the British Government, but said that thereBere great difficulties in the way of making an open display of their friendshipm view of the backwardness of the Afghan people and the consequent traditionalRrsistence of suspicion of the British. The Afghan Government were unableH drop their commercial connections with the German Government, but theyBpre doing their best to check German propaganda, which, he declared, in anyca-&apos;. was having no effect. The British Minister derived the impression that,thi&apos;ugh the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, and. possibly the majorityof he Cabinet, are pro-British and anxious for our support, they are not strongencMLih to pursue a definite policy in face of the traditional suspicions of British&quot;TFio; 1 es which still permeate the country and are fostered by German propaganda.B The question of the purchase of this year&apos;s Afghan wool and cotton, foreco:uanic warfare and political reasons, is under consideration. The Governmentoi india are prepared to purchase 10,000 tons of Afghan cotton as they didBfft year.i hVorth-West Frontier.Hie tribesmen concerned in the attack on the column near Razmak on the december have complied with the terms imposed on them and the towers oflostiles responsible have been destroyed.   In North Waziristan a gang underhostile leader called Shodi Khel have been active in one area and have beenecting subscriptions for the Faqir of Ipi.   Their activities have, however,sed considerable local resentment, and efforts are being made to induce the1 tribesmen to deal with them.  Fresh evidence has come to light of communi-between the Italian Legation at Kabul and the Faqir of Ipi.   In theJm   K&apos;:s a serious kidnapping outrage occurred in the Dera Ismail Khan district.le ;est of the frontier has remained quiet.
(c) Nepal.The discovery of a plot directed against the Maharaja (Prime Minister) andruling family in general resulted in a number of arrests in Nepal, and the Govern-ment of India, at the request of the Nepalese Government, also took action against persons in British India alleged to be involved. The Maharaja has now passedjudgment on those brought up for trial and has condemned 4 to death, 14 to lifeimprisonment and 20 others to varying terms of imprisonment. He has justifiedthe severity of the sentences on the ground that strong action was necessary toprevent the movement from spreading to alarming dimensions.There has also been serious indiscipline in a battalion, stationed at Kohat,of the contingent of the Nepalese Army which has been lent to the Governmentof India. This may be symptomatic of popular dislike of the ruling family, which supplies the majority of officers.21. Economic.(a) Supply arrangements East of Suez.His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Empire Governments concerned have accepted the conclusions of the Eastern Group Conference recommending theestablishment, with Headquarters in India, of an Eastern Group Supply Councilto co-ordinate arrangements for production and supply in the Eastern empire countries, and of a Central Provision Office to supply all theatres of war withinthe Eastern Group. Sir Archibald Carter (recently Secretary to the Admiralty)has been appointed by His Majesty&apos;s Government to be their representative onthe Eastern Group Supply Council, in which capacity he will also act as Chair-man of the Council in accordance with the recommendation of the Conference.Major-Gencral W. C. Holden has been appointed to take charge of the CentralProvision Office. Steps are being taken to ensure that the Supply Council and theCentral Provision Office are established with the least possible delay, andSir A. Carter and Major-General Holden left for India on the 2nd February totake up their appointments.(b) Ministry of Supply Mission to India.The Ministry of Supply Mission to India has submitted several initial reportscontaining important recommendations for the expansion of India&apos;s munitions production. These reports are receiving urgent consideration by the Ministry ofSupply. The Mission is now actively engaged in finalising the proposals in these reports and, in consultation with the authorities in India, is working- out in greater detail the requirements of factories and factory services, plant, machine tools, technical personnel. &amp;c, which the recommendations involve. When this further survey has been completed, the Mission will submit a final Report.(c) Mica.As a part of their rearmament programme, the United States Govern men!wish to build up a reserve Stock Pile of Mica, consisting of 1 million lb. oiblock mica and of 5 million lb. of splittings. They desire to purchase tinsmica from Plis Majesty&apos;s Government from stocks in this country and from India.Arrangements have now been made for the Government of India to obtain offersfrom the trade and to transmit them to the United States Government. The firs!offer, amounting to 67,700 lb. of block and 566,000 lb. of splittings, has beenmade and has been accepted by the United States Government. It is hoped thatthere will now be a steady flow of mica from India to the United States for thebuilding of the stock pile.22. Finance.(a) Rupee borroiving.The issue of 3 per cent. Defence Bonds, 1946, has been closed. In its pla*the Government of India have placed on tap a 3 per cent, loan redeemable at p*f1949-52. The issue now closed was repayable at 101, and thus the new loan iJon terms slightly more favourable to Government. There is no limit to the amountof individual subscriptions.
(b) Supply of Maria Theresa Dollars for the Middle East.In anticipation of the probable requirement of greatly increased quantitiesof Maria Theresa Dollars for use in the Middle East, and of the possibility thatthere might be difficulty or delay if supplies had to be obtained from the RoyalMint in London, arrangements were made a considerable time ago whereby theIndian Mints were provided with the requisite dies and were enabled to practisethe technique of production of these coins. Towards the end of December an urgent demand for the provision of such coins of which it was represented thatthe immediate supply on a large scale was of great importance in connection withthe successful conduct of the campaign was made by General Wavell, and it hasbeen possible to arrange that production and shipment at the rate of about two million pieces a month shall be made forthwith from the Indian Mints. Thishas not only enabled the supplies to be provided promptly at the time when tlieywere wanted, but has relieved the strain upon the Royal Mint, which is working at pressure and under difficulties, and has obviated the necessity of double ship-ment, i.e., of the silver bullion from the East to London and of the coin fromI .ondon to the Middle East.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.23. General.The internal situation remains unchanged.Press and Public Opinion. During the month all sections of the Press have occupied themselves with speculation on the next move of the Nazis. the burmese papers apprehend that, in spite of Mr. RoosevelCs speech, which is described as a victory for democracy, the Japanese may &quot; take the plunge &quot; in1941. and that this may bring the United States into the war.The Burmese Press express the view that the Government of Burma shouldbe consulted regarding the projected Sino-Burma railway, and also that,following the British policy, they should take the people into their confidence toprepare them against all possible dangers.The appointment of Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith as Governor has been welcomed, and tributes have been paid to Sir Archibald Cochrane.24. Defence.Nothing to report.25. External Relations.A Mission from Burma visited Chungking from the 16th to the 25th january to discuss with the Chinese Government various questions of common concern,and in particular means of improving existing methods of transport. A report,^received in a telegram from the Governor of Burma (already circulated to theCabinet) since the Mission&apos;s return, shows that the Chinese Government were,from the outset, insistent on the great importance of constructing the Burma-[Yunnan railway a question since decided by the Cabinet and were prepared,in return for a promise to undertake construction, to adjust the long-standing[dispute in regard to the fixation of the Burma-China frontier near the projectedrailway alignment in the sense desired by the Government of Burma.I 26. Economic Relations.la) Internal.A rise in the price of rice has led to an appreciable increase in the cost ofivino- in Rangoon for Burmans and Indians.IB)) External.Nothing to report.[22232]
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies inthe restricted sense, but also protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)(27) Military A fairs).(a) United States Bases.Discussions are proceeding here with Representatives of the United States.Newfoundland. Bermuda and certain West Indian Colonies on the terms of theleases and questions of administration and jurisdiction. The United Statesrequests in the matter of sites, which have in the main been agreed to. are in someterritories far in excess of what was contemplated in the exchange of notes.The United States Government produced at an early stage separate draft leasesfor each territory, giving to themselves very extensive rights and powers,including the right to acquire additional areas. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentobjected to the drafts, but they were unfortunately circulated in the territories and caused great alarm and resentment. This alarm led to requests fromTrinidad and the Leeward Islands to be specially represented at the Londondiscussions, and the Governor of Trinidad, accompanied by a prominentunofficial, and the Governor of the Leeward Islands, have flown home for thispurpose. It had already been decided that Representatives of Newfoundland andBermuda, should take part in the discussions.(b) Coast Defences.Progress is being made with the review of coast defences in certain colonies and it has been decided to establish coast defences at an early date in ascension island. Rodrigues, Direction Island (Cocos-Keeling Group) and Fanning Island,which are links in our cable communications with the Far East. Two 6-inchnaval guns have already been sent to Seychelles, the other important link in these communications. In addition, it is proposed to place coast defence guns inChristmas Island (Straits Settlements) and Ocean Island (Western Pacific),which are important producers of phosphates, and in Lutong (Sarawak).Dar-es-Salaam and Tanga (Tanganyika) and Zanzibar. It is proposed that the defences in Ocean Island and Fanning Island should be under the control of theAustralian and New Zealand Governments respectively, and the commonwealth government has itself offered to undertake responsibility for the defences to beestablished in Ocean Island. The question of additional coast defences in Fiji,and coast defences in Tonga, is still under consideration. In connection with thedecision to establish coast defences in Ascension, which is part of the Colony of st. Helena, it has been decided that compulsory military service should be intro-duced in the Colony.(c) East African Naval Volunteer Reserves.On the recommendation of the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station,arrangements have been made for the combined operation of the Naval VolunteerReserves of Kenya, Tanganyika and Zanzibar under the immediate command ofthe Officer in Charge of the Kenya unit, who will be responsible through theNaval Officer in Charge, East Africa and Zanzibar (formerly Naval Officer inCharge, Kilindini), to the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies. To give effect tothis decision, certain amendments are necessary in the Naval Volunteer Reservelegislation of the East African territories in question, and the Governmentsconcerned have been asked to introduce legislation accordingly.(d) Malta.In view of the recent heavy air raids on Malta, the introduction of a schemeof compensation for damage to property and for personal injuries has been authorised.   The Acting Governor has been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-
t regard it as clearly right that the people of Malta should be covered andould know that they are covered by adequate arrangements for compensation,th for personal injuries and for damage to property, comparable to those inrce or in contemplation in the United Kingdom.  It is intended that the Colonyould itself operate its own schemes and that these should be retrospective in[feet.  The revenues of the Island will make such contributions as may be within2 Colony&apos;s means towards the eventual cost, and contributions will be soughtom private individuals within their capacity.
