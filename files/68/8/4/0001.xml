(R) (41) 4.January 16, 1941.WAR CABINET.REPORTS   EOR   THE   MONTH   OF   DECEMBER   1940   FOR   THEDOMINIONS,   INDIA,   BURMA   AND   THE   COLONIES,PROTECTORATES AND MANDATED TERRITORIES,THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State J. or Dominion Affairs.CANADA.1. General Position.IN internal affairs, some anxiety is shown over labour supply problems, andover the recent heavy shipping losses. Bills designed to facilitate UnitedKingdom exports to Canada, and to improve the foreign exchange position, havebeen introduced into Parliament.President roosevelt&apos;s plan for aiding Britain had an enthusiastic reception,and his affirmation of belief in the triumph of the Allied cause is noted withparticular satisfaction by the press. One consequence of this is that the presshas been emphasizing the urgency of mobilizing full North American aid for britain.Unfavourable comment on Mr. de Valera&apos;s recent address, which was described as a &quot; cheap appeal to racial prejudice,&quot; has appeared. Eire is saidto be playing with fire, and Mr. de Valera is urged to reconsider his attitude in the light of President Roosevelt&apos;s appeal.Press comment on the appointment of Lord Halifax to succeed the lateLord Lothian, to whose great work at Washington many tributes have been paid, is good. Lord Halifax is thought to have &quot; that strain of idealism whichappeals so strongly to the Americans.&quot;Canadians have accepted the decision to supply wheat to Spain, but thereis no enthusiasm over it.There has been great indignation over the destruction of part of the City ofLondon by fire, and much praise for the heroism of Londoners. Canadian firemenhave offered to form a volunteer corps for service in the United Kingdom.A further speech by the Premier of Quebec (Mr. Godbout) emphasizing the unity of Quebec with the rest of the Dominion in the prosecution of the war has been universally applauded in Canada.French-Canadian opinion appreciates the difficulties of the Vichy Goyern-ment, and welcomes the removal of M. Laval.[22128] ; B
2COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.4. General Position.The Government position has been slightly strengthened by a success in a recent bye-election.The crisis which occurred in connection with the budget has been greatlydeplored by the Australian public, and the Press continues to call for theformation of a National Government.Much disquiet is felt over the alleged leakage of information about shippingmovements in the Pacific.The United Kingdom High Commissioner reports that the Australian public as a whole is not yet sensible of the necessity for the conservation of petrol.Great enthusiasm has been shown over the capture by Australian forces ofBardia, referred to in one paper under the heading : &quot; Puncture of the SawdustCaesar.&quot;Mr. Beasley, leader of the Non-Communist Labour Party, described the actionof the United Kingdom Government in giving a  31 million contract for ship-building to the United States, as a staggering blow to the Australian shipbuilding industry.In foreign affairs general appreciation is expressed of the choice ofLord Halifax as successor to the late Lord Lothian at Washington, and the return of Mr. Eden, &quot; the ablest and most trusted Foreign Secretary sinceSir Edward Grey,&quot; to the Foreign Office, is generally welcomed by the AustralianPress.Press comment on the recent bombing of Eire is that &quot; all that Eire holdsdear depends on Britain being able to win victory over the Nazis, and Eireneutrality at present works to prevent that victory.&quot;Mr. Ralston, the Minister of National Defence, and Major-General Crerar,Chief of the General Staff of Canada, have recently completed a visit to thiscountry, in the course of which full discussions on a number of defence questionstook place.Among these was the Canadian Governments suggestion that the construc-tion of cruisers and destroyers might be undertaken in Canada. The projectwould require the provision of special apparatus and key men from this country;it has been explained to the Canadian Government that in view of our own urgentneeds in these they could not be spared. Tt lias, however, been suggested to themthat it would be of the greatest assistance if they could undertake to builddestroyers to the latest United States design, obtaining technical help and specialapparatus from the United States of America. The Canadian Government are considering this alternative, though up to now their reaction has not been very favourable.The 2nd Canadian Division has now been assembled in the United Kingdomand the Canadian Corps is being formally constituted. The Canadian intentions as regards the raising and despatch oversea of further military formations was discussed with Mr. Ralston, who, it is understood, has sought the canadian government&apos;s approval to a programme based on these discussions.Mr. Howe, the Minister of Munitions and Supplies, and officials of his department have been discussing in London questions of munitions supplies withthe Ministers and Departments concerned.3. Economic Activities.The Canadian Government imposed in December important measures for the conservation of their resources of United States dollars and also for the encouragement of imports from the United Kingdom. Importation of a long listof non-essential commodities is now prohibited except from the sterling area, andthe British preferential tariff rates have been suspended or reduced on a largenumber of imports from the United Kingdom. These measures should be ofconsiderable assistance to our dollar-earning export trade, and a message of warmappreciation was sent to the Canadian Government for their action.
Roman Catholic newspapers have described Great Britain as the chiefbulwark of Christian civilization in the world to-day, against the paganarrogance of Nazi Germany, and the militant atheism of Soviet Russia.5. Naval, Military and Air Activities.Since the latter part of November German raiders have been active in theSouth-West Pacific Area, and mines have been laid in Australian waters. Germanraiders sank 5 phosphate ships off Nauru on the 8th December and a number ofother merchant ships have been lost. On the 27th December the quays at Nauruwere shelled by a raider and considerable damage was done to them and thephosphate shed; there was no loss of life. Arrangements have been made tostrengthen the cruiser force on the Australian station. It has been madecompulsory for all merchant vessels on the Australian register to be degaussedand for all but the smallest to be fitted with paravanes also.Up to the end of December enlistments in the Australian Imperial Forcetotalled 128,000, of whom 73,000 had left Australia. Recruiting for the force will be resumed this month to fulfil a monthly requirement of 5,000 reinforcements.The Commonwealth Government have agreed to the move of an Australianbrigade to Malaya.Australian troops have taken a prominent part in the operations in theWestern Desert. The two Australian brigades which have been stationed inthis country are being moved to the Middle East and reinforcements are alsoarriving from Australia.The first batches of pilots, observers and wireless operator-air gunners toreceive full training in Australia under the Empire Air Training Scheme sailedin December.6. Economic Activities.The Commonwealth Budget for 1940-41 is balanced at  150,000,000, whichis 50 per cent, higher than last year&apos;s record Budget. Severe taxation increases have been imposed to bring in  31,000,000. The War Estimate for 1940-41 isfor  186,000,000; of this sum  143,000,000 is for local expenditure, which is tobe met as to  65,000.000 from the Budget and the remainder from loan andcash balances.NEW ZEALAND.7. General Position.Mr. Fraser, the Prime Minister, commenting on the 31st December on president roosevelt&apos;s broadcast talk, said that his words provided a &quot; powerfulcontribution towards our own security in the Pacific.&quot; He appealed to the peopleof New Zealand to make a tremendous war effort in 1941.Mr. Nash, the Minister of Finance, has been reappointed deputy leader ofthe Parliamentary Labour Party.Some anxiety is shown over the effect of shipping losses on the New Zealandexport trade, and there is, in particular, widespread concern over the activitiesof raiders in the Pacific and Indian oceans.Reports that the Australian Minister at Washington had conferred withMr. Cordell Hull on the question of the defence of the Pacific were received with interest.Criticism of the United Kingdom press censorship continues to be offered,especially as regards Admiralty and Air Ministry communiques, which arethought to be &quot; too rigid.&quot;The Prime Minister has extended an invitation from the New Zealandfederation of Labour to the Trades Union Congress to send representatives on afraternal visit to New Zealand.Public opinion is elated at the British successes in Libya and the capture of Bardia is specially welcomed, though some disappointment is shown at thesmall share of the New Zealand troops in these engagements.The Press paid striking tributes to the work of the late Lord Lothian.Indignation is expressed over the recent bombing and firing of an historicpart of London, while Press comment on the situation in Eire is that the problems raised by Eire&apos;s neutrality may easily become both acute and dangerous[22128] B 2
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.10. General Position.A weekly air service between the Union and Portuguese West Africa wasbegun on the 17th December by the South African Railways. This, and the newshipping service between the Union and the Belgian Congo, are regarded as a welcome augury of the rapid creation of export trade with those countries. this new spirit of co-operation with other African territories in military and commercial matters is said by the Union press to be in striking contrast to thetendency before the present war.The Minister for Agriculture has drawn attention to the great value toUnion agriculture of the United Kingdom market. Opposition papers, however,point out that farmers are not profiting from this market, and instance the harmdone to South Africa by the recent United Kingdom embargo on the import ofcertain kinds of fruits.The serious split in the ranks of the Reunited Party which occurred on theresignations of General Hertzog and Mr. Havenga has resulted in the formationof a new party, the &quot;Afrikander Union.&quot; by the Hertzog group, to upholdGeneral FIertzog&apos;s principles of &quot; reasonableness, honesty and decency in public life.&quot; Dr. Malan, the Republican leader, characterised this move as an attemptto &quot;build a bridge&quot; between the supporters of General Hertzog and general smuts, and as a dagger at the heart of the Reunited Party. It is thought that several of the Hertzog supporters in Parliament may decide to support general smuts, whose prestige increases daily.In foreign affairs, the speech of President Roosevelt, in which he expressed his confidence in an ultimate British victory, has greatly impressed all shades ofopinion. Opposition papers say that, as the President has openly declared hisenmity to the Axis Powers, he has so committed himself to aid Britain that united States participation in the war could no longer be avoided if Britain&apos;present position were to deteriorate.The Opposition press, while trying to whittle down the value of the recentBritish successes in Libya, is obviously impressed by the efficiency of the Britishoperations there, and by the scale of the British reinforcements in the middle east. This gives it the opportunity to suggest that, now that the Italian threat to North Africa has been so greatly diminished, there is no real need to retain a union force in Kenya.The decision to raise the status of the Agent-General for India to that of high Commissioner is regarded favourably, and the Government press praise the growing part which India is playing in the war.Criticism continues to be offered on the attitude of Eire towards the questionof naval bases.   The passing of Lord Lothian, that &quot; friend of South Africa,&quot;was noted with sadness, and many complimentary references to his work in SouthAfrica, and as Ambassador at Washington, have appeared.The total numbers of men serving overseas up to the beginning of december was : Army, 24.000; Air Force, 1,400; Navy. 2.000; a further 6,900 Army and1,500 Air Force personnel are in training for service overseas. 5,600 Army,4,300 Air Force and 750 Navy personnel are permanently mobilised in NewZealand and 12.000 territorials are undergoing intensive training.The New Zealand Brigade which has been stationed in this country is beingmoved to the Middle East.In view of the activities of German raiders in adjacent waters (to which reference is made above under &quot; Commonwealth of Australia &quot;), the New zealand government have pressed for the release of long-range reconnaissance aircraft to assist in raider-hunting; 6 Hudsons are accordingly being released to them.9. Economic Activities.-Nothing of importance to report.
EIRE.13. General Position.Relations with Eire during December have been coloured by the discussion in the press of all countries of the questions of Eire&apos;s neutrality and of theUnited Kingdom desire to obtain the use of ports in Eire. In a broadcast to thepeople of the United States on Christmas Day, Mr. de Valera complained of thepress campaign against him and reaffirmed Eire&apos;s neutrality. He declared thatEire was already suffering heavily as a result of the war, and appealed to theUnited States of America to supply her with weapons and food-stuffs. referring to the suggestion that the ports should be seized, he stated : &apos;&apos; Should any attemptbe made to put such a suggestion into execution we shall defend ourselves to theutmost of our power.&apos;&apos; **President Roosevelt, speaking on the 29th December, said: &quot;Analyse foryourselves the future of two countries even nearer to Germany (than SouthAmerica), if the Nazis won. Could Ireland hold out, and would Irish freedom be permitted as an amazing exception in a world not free? &quot;German relations with Eire have taken a turn for the worse during themonth. Bombs were dropped in County Dublin and County Monaghan on the21st December. Bombs have subsequently fallen near Drogheda and Dublin(31st December), in County Car low and Dublin (1st January), and at Enniskerry,on Dublin and in County Wexford (2nd January). Some of the bombs have been identified as German, and the Eire Government have issued an official statement to this effect and have lodged protests with the German Government. Aircraftflying over Dublin City and Lough Swilly on the 29th December were fired on byground defences, and in the former case fighters were sent up to intercept. Theaircraft over Lough Swilly, which appears to have been British, has formed thesubject of an official protest by the Eire High Commissioner in London.United Kingdom military aircraft made forced landings in Eire and the crews have been interned.German attacks have also been made on ships, trading to Eire. An Eire-registered vessel has been sunk in a raid on a United Kingdom port, and anEire-registered vessel belonging to the Irish Lights Commissioners has been attacked and sunk inside Eire territorial waters. Two British tankers engagedm carrying oil to Eire have also been sunk, one in a United Kingdom port, theother in or near Eire territorial waters. This has resulted in a sudden and acutepetrol shortage in Eire, and the reduction of the petrol ration there for Januaryfrom a level approximately double that of the United Kingdom ration to one-quarter of the original level.At the same time as Germany is showing increased disregard for Eire&apos;interests, the German press has been publishing warnings to the United Statesagainst allowing United States ships to enter Eire waters, and has been spreadingrumours of a British intention to occupy Eire.A Board of Trade Order, which came into force on the 1st January, subjectedvarious classes of exports to Eire to licence. These included animal feeding-stuffs,fertilisers and oranges and lemons.The Union Government have accepted a suggestion that a United kingdom military liaison mission should be established in the Union, and arrangements forthe mission are in hand. The mission will co-ordinate the activities of the variousUnited Kingdom military bodies now in the Union (the transit camp and movement and provost staff at Durban and the liaison staffs at general andconvalescent hospitals) and will supplement the existing means of liaison betweenthe United Kingdom and the Union Defence H.Q.The 3rd Union Brigade has now arrived in Kenya. Units of the SouthAfrican Forces have carried out a successful operation at El Wak in italian somaliland.12. Economic Activities.Nothing of importance to report.
6Another Order, published on the 8th January to come into force on the20th January, subjects virtually all commodities in short supply in the countryto the licence requirement, It has been decided that, except in the case of food-stuffs, no licences shall be granted for the export to Eire of goods which are in short supply here, and which we do not desire to export to Eire for our ownreasons. In the case of food-stuffs exports will be licensed to enable the Eireauthorities to maintain a ration not greater than that in the United Kingdom.It has also been decided that no United Kingdom-controlled shipping, or space in United Kingdom-controlled ships, shall be provided to carry goods for Eire,and that neutral shipowners shall be pressed to follow a similar policy.NEWFOUNDLAND.14. General Position.Mr. Gibson, Canadian Minister for National Revenues, has visitedNewfoundland in order to discuss administrative and financial points arising inconnection with Canada&apos;s undertaking to control and defend the air ports duringthe war.In connection with the lease of naval and air bases to the U.S.A., a U.S.steamer with 1,000 U.S. troops is expected to moor at St. John&apos;s in themiddle of January for an indefinite period. A number of questions connectedwith Customs and land acquisition have, in consequence, come up for early decision, although the formal conference between the British and U.S. repre-sentatives has not yet taken place. Newfoundland proposes to take theopportunity of raising with the U.S.A. the question of certain compensatoryadvantages with reference to the export of fresh and frozen fish and fish oils tothe U.S.A. and the immigration quotas for Newfoundland in the United States.15. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.The 13th Naval Contingent (149 men) has arrived safely, and the8th Contingent for the Army (59 men) has also arrived.16. Economic Activities.At the request of the Ministry of Shipping the Government of Newfoundlandare continuing to recruit deckhands and firemen for service on british merchant ships.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.17. Military and Air Force Activities.Nothing of importance to report.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.18. General.Political Situation.By the end of November the first stage of gandhis movement for the offeringof civil disobedience by individual Congress leaders was in full swing, and anumber of ex-Ministers and other prominent persons had been arrested. Thesearrests continued through the month of December and reached a total of 625. Thefirst phase of the movement is now believed to be over, and the main activity of congress appears to be devoted to selecting candidates for a &quot;second phase&quot;beginning the 7th January.   The persons offering satyagraha in this stage will
be more numerous but less distinguished, and the President of the Congress (whohas since been arrested) has estimated that 15,000 persons would offer satyagrahain the next three months, after which the field might be opened to all and sundry.The Government of India consider that general popular reactions have beensurprisingly small, while industrial production and the services have not been affected. Not move than half the Congress leaders of the selected categories arenow at large. The month closed with a &quot; Christmas truce &quot; declared by Gandhi,professedly for the benefit of Government officers concerned with law and order.Resolutions have been passed by conferences opposed to Congress, including one for which M. N. Roy, the ex-Communist leader, was largely responsible. Anumber of Liberal and Labour leaders took part in this meeting, which was chiefly concerned to support Great Britain against the Nazis. It remains to be seenwhat support Mr. Roy can gather by his further efforts to work up a&quot; win-the-war &quot; front. A resolution adopted by the Hindu Mahasabha was nothelpful. The Liberal Federation passed a resolution in favour of whole-hearted support in the war, but suggesting that a change in Government policy was required.19. Military Affairs.(i) The motor cavalry brigade, equipped with trucks, will leave India for theMiddle East at the end of Januaiy.(ii) The Government of India have agreed to send two Indian States Forcesinfantry battalions to the Middle East for guard and Internal Security duties.These will leave at the end of January. The possibility of providing a thirdbattalion is being examined.20. Foreign and Frontier Relations.(i) Afghanistan. There is nothing of political importance to report. TheBritish Minister has paid a short visit to India for consultation with the Govern-inent of India, returning to Kabul on the 12th December. Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytlerhas since undergone a successful operation for appendicitis.(ii) North-West Frontier. Land and air operations have been undertakenagainst strong hostile gang concentrations in South Waziristan at the beginningof December. On the 4th and 6th December the village of Hayat Khan, a leader of the hostile tribesmen, was destroyed by air action. In the course of land operations serious casualties were sustained by two companies of Punjabis on the night of the 7th/8th December during the withdrawal of a column of troops which had moved out from Razmak Camp. Casualties consisted of one british officer (Lt.-Col. G. F. Faulkner), two Indian officers, one British other rank and 56 Indian other ranks killed or died of wounds, and three Indian officersand 49 Indian other ranks wounded. Punitive action which is now being taken against the tribesmen concerned includes the destruction of the towers of thepersons chiefly implicated, the imposition of a fine of rifles and ammunition anda demand for the surrender of hostages. In the event of non-compliance withthe demands or resistance to our forces, the villages concerned will be destroyed.On the 22nd December a large gang blocked a road in the Kohat district and looted two lorries, kidnapping five persons and wounding two others, andsubsequently eluded the police and Frontier Constabulary by escaping into tribalterritory.The rest of the frontier has remained quiet.At the invitation of the Government of India officers of the Turkish military mission in Afghanistan paid a highly successful visit to Peshawar and other points on the frontier during the week ending the 23rd December. Evidence ofthe closeness of British friendship with Turkey, thus afforded, is calculated tohave a good effect on Muslim feeling on the frontier.(iii) Nepal. Dr. Filchner, the well-known German scientist who went toNepal before the war to carry out a geo-magnetic survey for the NepaleseGovernment, and who has been suspected of engaging in anti-British activities,has now expressed a desire to go to India for treatment of kidney trouble. Aftertreatment it is understood that he will be interned in India together with histwo German assistants who are accompanying him. The party has just arrived in India under a British Indian Police escort.
s(iv) Persian Gulf. British prestige continues to rise owing to the recentsuccesses against the Italians in the Western Desert and in Albania. The peopleof the Persian Gulf States are very anti-Italian.21. Finance.New type of rupee coin. In the Report for July 1940 was mentioned theintroduction of new types of half-rupee and quarter-rupee coins in 500-fine silver.The further step has now been taken of providing for a similar change in thefineness of the silver rupee, which has hitherto been 916-fme. The new coin willbe of the same &quot; quaternary &quot; alloy as the present United Kingdom silver coinage.One advantage of this change is a potential great economy in the use of silver, which it is hoped may obviate any risk that silver might have to be imported into India at the cost of dollar exchange. A second great advantageis the following : The Indian currency system has always been subject to the threat that a steep rise in the price of silver might make tlhe rupee more valuableas a piece of metal than as a coin, and that the circulation of the country might thus disappear into the melting pot. This danger actually materialised afterthe 1914-18 war, and resulted in the exchange value of the rupee being forcedup from Is. 4c/. to nearly 3s., a procedure to which India&apos;s subsequent currencytroubles are largely attributable. This hitherto perpetual threat to the stability of the Indian currency may be regarded as having, for practical purposes, beenpermanently removed by the measure now undertaken.Advantage has been taken of the opportunity afforded by the issue of a new type of coin to equip it with a &quot; security edge.&quot; This consists of a recessedgroove running round the rim of the coin, which makes it proof against counter-feiting by the commonly used method of moulding. There is some ground forhope that when the Indian public discover that the new style of coin incorporatesthis protection against the counterfeiter they will realise that it is a better andnot a worse coin than the rupee with which they have so long been familiar, andthat the transition will thus be facilitated.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.22. General.The situation in the districts is peaceful, and prospects of a good harvestcontribute to its remaining so.Press and Public Opinion.Lord Lothian&apos;s death is given prominence by all sections of the press. the burmese papers particularly pay tribute to his work, and express the opinionthat the entry of the United States into the war is only a matter of time.The British-owned press attributes the strained relations between Thailandand Indo-Chinia to Japan&apos;s machinations, and commends the United States move to hold up supplies to Thailand.The Burmese press speaks of Thailand&apos;s opportunist policy backed by japan, and urges the importance of preventing Japan from turning her attentionsouthwards. It is convinced that Britain is prepared against all eventualities inthe Middle East, but envisages the possibility of the Axis winning over turkey and of Anglo-Turkish hostilities. The Indian-owned press printed in Englishbelieves that Turke)r will fight against the Axis.23. Economic Relations.(a) Internal. Nil.(b) External. During November the number of lorries leaving and enteringBurma by the China road averaged 131 outwards and 125 inwards each day.Over 3,000 tons of material were transported to China, and largeconsignments of wolfram and tung oil arrived from China.
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. -In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)24. Military Affairs.(a) United States Bases.It has now been decided by His Majesty&apos;s Government that the wishes ofthe United States Government in regard to sites for bases in the West Indiesmust be met in full. It is hoped, however, that the United States Governmentin return will be willing to meet our wishes over the questions of administration and jurisdiction. His Majesty&apos;s Government has pressed that the discussion ofthese questions should take place in London and not in Washington, and theUnited States Government have reluctantly agreed to this course.(b) West Indies: Security Services and Security Intelligence.As a consequence of the recent visit by the Director of Postal and telegraph censorship, the Commander-in-Chief, America and West Indies, has made certain recommendations for improving security arrangements in the West Indian area.These recommendations include the appointment of a Co-ordinating Officer forintelligence work to be stationed at Jamaica, stricter measui&quot;es for dealing with enemy aliens and non-enemy aliens who may be enemy agents in transit by sea or air in this area, and the establishment of a small base for contraband controland enemy exports examination in Trinidad.Two special security intelligence officers are being sent out from england to strengthen this side of the local Governments&apos; staff, one to cover the westerngroup of Colonies with headquarters at Jamaica, and one to cover the eastern group with headquarters at Trinidad. These officers will co-ordinate all securityintelligence work within their areas and maintain liaison with each other, with.Bermuda and with London. Instructions have been sent to the Governors for&apos;stricter control of aliens in transit.The proposal to set up a contraband control base in Trinidad is underconsideration.(c) Malaya.In a general appreciation of the Far Eastern position the Commander-in-Chief, Far East, has made certain recommendations for improving the efficiency of the Malayan Volunteer Force. The Force will shortly be called up for twomonths&apos; intensive training,under a scheme which will involve little or no reductionof tin and rubber output. If measures which will interfere with these twoessential industries are contemplated, the matter is to be referred home forconsideration before any decision is taken.25. Disposal of Colonial Products.Bananas.In continuance of the measures reported last month to deal with thesituation arising from the stopping of exports of bananas from various Coloniesio this country, Treasury approval has been obtained for the grant to theGovernment of Nigeria of a sum of  10,000 per month, for three months in thefirst instance, to cover the cost of maintaining the cultivation of the bananaplantations in the British Cameroons, which it would otherwise \ have been necessary to abandon with considerable ill-effects on local employment and morale.26. War Risk Insurance in the Colonies.Discussions have been proceeding for some months regarding the need for warrisk insurance of stocks of commodities, both local produce and importedmerchandise, held in Colonies which may be the scene of warlike operations.  Theproblem has arisen particularly in East Africa, where the Governments of Kenyar22128] c
10and Uganda and local commercial interests, on being consulted, stated that they regarded the institution of such a scheme as very desirable. Since such insuranceis outside the scope of commercial insurance companies and the Colonial Govern-ments concerned are not themselves in a strong enough financial position to carry the risk, agreement has been reached with the Treasury for the institution of alocal scheme on the lines of that in this country, backed by a guarantee by theBritish Government, who will bear any loss or take any profit arising from theoperation of the scheme. It is proposed shortly to submit draft legislationempowering the Treasury to guarantee approved schemes in any Colonies.Meanwhile, the Governments of Kenya and Uganda have been authorised tointroduce their scheme immediately as it is urgently required for the beginningof the cotton crop; but no public announcement of the guarantee by the BritishGovernment is being made until it has first been announced in Parliament here.Reports on Particular Colonies.27. West Africa.A Conference of West African Governors and Acting Governors and theG.O.C., West Africa, met at Lagos on the 16th December to consider various questions in which closer co-ordination between individual West african governments and between all of them and the military authorities in West africa is required. The proceedings were marred by the sudden death on the eve of theConference of Mr. H. R. Oke, C.M.G., M.C.&quot;, Colonial Secretary of the Gambia,who, as Officer Administering the Government, had flown to Lagos to attend theConference.28. West Indies.A visit has been paid to the West Indies hy an Economic Mission from theUnited States headed by the economist 1\. W. Taussig and including as well aLieutenant-Colonel and a Lieutenant-Commander. The object of this mission,which left at very short notice, was stated to be an examination of social andeconomic conditions in the British West Indies in order to help the United states to cope with similar problems in their own Caribbean territories. It appears thatthe United States are concerned regarding symptoms of discontent in their ownterritories, which may be artificially fomented from outside, and wish to find out what the position is in the British West Indies. Concern was expressed here lestthis visit, so close on the heels of Admiral Greenslade&apos;s mission regarding bases,might arouse apprehensions in the West Indies regarding United Statespenetration.In conversation with the Governor of the Windward Islands, Mr. Taussigsaid that &quot; he was studying the possibility of establishing an international bodydesigned to co-ordinate economic and social efforts within the Caribbean area,including control of production and prices in relation to the markets within theWestern Hemisphere. He definitely expressed the view that any such body shouldbe formed as soon as possible so as to ensure as far as possible a measure of stability following the conclusion of hostilities.&quot; It is not known how much importance need be attached to this suggestion, but it has a bearing on the workof the Committee on Surpluses recently set up under Sir Frederick Leith-Ross.29. Ceylon.The failure to reach agreement with the Government of India on certain matters of difference between Ceylon and India is being examined by the governor and the Ministers.The War Purposes Fund promoted by the Government of Ceylon as a contribution to His Majesty&apos;s Government has now reached 1 million rupees.30. Hong Kong.The Ordinance giving power to control immigration into the Colony has been enacted, and is to come into operation in the middle of January.An offer has been accepted from the Rhodes Trustees of a grant of money for a period of years to provide studentships at Oxford for selected Chinesegraduates of Hong Kong University.
The new Governor, Mr. (now Sir) J. H. Hall, has arrived in the Colony andassumed the administration.The Quteibi tribe is still causing trouble in the Western area of the protectorate, and it has been necessary to withdraw the small force of GovernmentGuards from the positions they had taken up on the Aden-Dhala road.Negotiations are going on with the tribesmen concerned, and in the meantime air action and economic pressure is being applied.32. Palestine.There were no political developments during the month on the Arab side.The continued Greek success is having good effect, and the British successes have created a deep impression and have further increased confidence in Britishstrength generally and our ability to protect the territories for which we areresponsible. Moslems in Jaffa staged a demonstration to celebrate the Greek andBritish victories.The Arabs in general were not moved by the deportation of illegal immigrantswhich they considered no more than the Governments duty, but there is no doubtthat failure to take such action would have aroused considerable feeling. In fact,retention in Palestine of the Patria passengers evoked the cynical comment thatthe Government would always be out-manoeuvred by the Jews.The sinking of -the s.s. Patria on the 25th November aroused mixed feelings inthe Jewish community; relief that illegal immigrants had been landed being mixedwith sorrow at the loss of life and some condemnation of the sabotage. With theannouncement on the 4th December that survivors would not be deported, thegeneral attitude turned to complacency at the &quot; victory &quot; over the Government.The deportation on the 9th December of the illegal immigrants who had arrived on the s.s. Atlantic came as a surprise to the Jewish community, but the resultantagitation against the Government was neither geaeral nor spontaneous. Jewishorganisations have since engaged in a pamphleteering campaign with the objectof embittering opinion against the policy of deporting illegal immigrants. TheJewish Agency considers that they have suffered a major political defeat, andin an attempt to restore their self-esteem are developing an attack on the! Palestinian Government (and on the High Commissioner in particular) asI distinct from His Majesty&apos;s Government, whom they have no desire to alienate.There is no diminution of Communist activities.The recruitment of both Arabs and Jews for the Palestine InfantryCompanies and other units has been satisfactorily maintained.Several small gangs have operated and incidents of violence on the part of arabs still continue, but they are on an unimportant scale and are all clearlybanditry.
