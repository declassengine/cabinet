WAR CABINET.THE COAL POSITION.MONTKXY REPORT BY Z\:\ SKORETAKY FOR MINES COVERING MAY. 1941,*Negotiations between owners and men in regard to conditions of servicehave continued throughout the month.   A Delegate Conference of the Mineworkers1Federation called to consider the Essential Work Order on the 8th Hay was ledto give it approval by a Government assurance that the owners were ready todiscuss the question of a minimum wage and that the Government would assist, if need bo, in bringing the negotiations to a speedy and successful conclusions the formal application for a minimum wage of . 4- &amp; week came before theJoint Consultative Committee (of the Mining Association and the Mineworkers1Federation) on the 21st May.   In view of the growing seriousness of the supplsituation, the owners agreed to offer instead of a minimum wage a bonus of6d, a shift for full weekly attendance, conditionally upon an equivalent incrof coal prices.   The men offered to accept l/- a day on like conditions:Government approval was duly given for an advance of coal prices of 10da a tonfrom 2nd June and unanimous and even cordial agreement was reached between thetwo sides on those terms.Unfortuiaately the conditions of the bonus had been inadequately worked outin the Joint Consultative Committee and after considerable discussion in thecoalfields and. a keen debate in the House of Commons, the agreement was rejected by the Executive Committee of the Federation on the 29th May.   further negotiations followed and after considerable modification of the conditions the bonus arrangement was eventually accepted by the Executive Committee on the6th June,,The debate in the Commons on the 28th May took place on a motion to approvea draft Order to enable the Central Council of Colliery Owners to meet the costof the guaranteed pay week (under the Essential Work Order) from a central fundprovided by a levy on all collieries.   Both Houses approved the Order on the28th May;   it would seem reasonable to assume that, all major issues inconnection with the Essential Work Order as well as the attendance bonus havenow been satisfactorily settled and that the way is at last clear forwhole-hearted co-operation in the industry in increasing production.Meanwhile the need for greater output has become acute.   The stockingprogramme appended to my report for February (v7P(R)(Ll)20) involved anaverage weekly production during the seven months to 31st October next of4*5 million tons.   During the first 9 weeks of this period output has fallenshort of this figure by amounts now aggregating 3.5 million tons:   the fallin the numbers of workers on colliery books lias, it is true, been arrestedbut there has as yet been no appreciable increase.   All possible measures
D.  R.  G.are being developed to increase production with the existing labour force,but after so poor a start it is obvious that if transport conditions next winter are to be no better than last, it vri.ll be impossible to prevent a dangerous coal shortage in many areas unless(a) the man-power of the industry is rapidly and very substantially increased and(b) steps are taken to rcdv.ee fuel consumption for thelower priority   purposes, including domestic.Discussions have already been opened with the Minister of Labour and NationService for the return of 50;000 men to the industry, and plans are beingworked out in the Jlepartment for reducing consumption.The usual statistical tables are appended to this report.   Theimprovement in transport, weather conditions and other factors affectingmining operations is shown by the average number of days worked reaching5.70 for the week ended 24th May, the highest figure for any week since the collapse of Prance.    The continuance of cold, weather into May v/as responoibfor a slight further decline in the stocks of ga.s companies during the nont.a year ago they increased during May by 2(72,000 tons.    I also attach a copyof a statement recently prepared for the Battle of the Atlantic Committeegiving a revised estimate of coal consumption and exports for the six month to 31st October next and a rough forecast for the following six months(to 30th April, 1942).
