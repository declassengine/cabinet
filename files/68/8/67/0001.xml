( MONTHLY REPORT   for OCTOBER, 19kl.?ARJASTThe United States and British embargo on trade with Japanremains virtually complete.     Although exports of iron ore from the philippines have not been definitely prohibited and licences alreadyissued for 159,000 tons will not be revoked,    it&apos;appears that theUnited States Government intend to impose administrative restrictions which will make further shipments to Japan impossible.       similar action, to stop exports of iron ore from Malaya to Japan, is beingtaken by the Government of the Straits Settlements.It has now been decided that the only Japanese cor/modityessential to us is magnesium.      Mis Majesty&apos;s Government intend tonegotiate for magnesium against the release of funds required by theJapanese to maintain their diplomatic and consular staffs in thiscountry.As a result of the freezing orders, Japan is short offoreign exchange.      She is already using gold for at least some ofher expenditure in Indo-China, Thailand and South America.,His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Governmenthave begun to pre-empt rubber in Thailand.     Between October 18thand 28&quot;th, the East Asiatic Company bought over a thousand tons ontheir behalf..The&quot;s.s.  &quot;Francois L.D.&quot; arrived at Casablanca fromIndo-China with 6,900 tons of rubber.      This vessel - a motor ship -made the voyage (probably round the Horn) without touching at anyport en route.      Various steps have been taken to hold up or inter-cept a sister ship of the &quot;Francois L.D.&quot; which is reported to betrying to do the same thing.EUROPEAN NEUTRALS.As the Swedish&quot; Government did not reply to our request for anundertaking not to re-export to Finland goods of a kind importedthrough our controls, no navicerts were granted for the shipment ofsuch goods to Sweden.The Spanish Government have given acceptable assurances inreturn for the release of the ships referred to in the monthlyreport for September.      They have, however, not yet agreed that theships must first proceed to a British port to discharge, the seizedcargoes.In Portugal the Germans stopped buying wolfram for a time.Before they re-entered the market we were able to increase   our-Purchases substantially.       During the month we bought 21+2 tons ,inthe free market.     In addition some 200 tons were sold by Britishwned companies to the Ministry of Supply.gjANCE and FRENCH COLONIES.Negotiations continued for the supply to French North Africao  regular quantities of oil.     The United States Government havegreed that shipments shall be limited to one tanker - the   &quot;S.S.traine&quot; - carrying about 30,000 tons a quarter.     For the currentrter we propose to allow in only kerosene, low grade gasoline andas oil..     We hope to prevent further shipments of fuel oil untilayal stocks are reduced to 15?000 tons, and we are asking   foratisfactory evidence that stocks of alcohol and ground nut oil areeing used as fuel wherever possible.TURKEY /
