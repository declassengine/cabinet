ENERGY FOODS (fats) Stocks of oilseeds and oils are expected to increase in the immediate future; the outlook for the rationed fats is uncertain.

Oilseeds &amp; vegetable oils: (i) There was a slight decline in the stocks of both seeds and oils in November, and the hard oil and linseed stock positions deteriorated.

(ii) In the immediate future stocks of seeds and oils are expected to show an upward trend.

Margarine, land and butter: (i) The outlook for the rationed fats is difficult to assess at the present time because of the uncertainty of supplies of oilseeds and vegetable oils from the Far East, the effect of a curtailment of imports of oils and fats into the U.S.A. on Lend/Lease supplies of land and our dependence on the Southern Dominions for butter supplies.

(ii) It has become difficult, with a growth of domestic demand in the U.S.A., to obtain the necessary supplies of vitamin A for the fortification of margarine. Canada may be a new source of supply.

ANIMAL PROTEIN FOODS The uncertain outlook makes it necessary to issue corned beef as part of the 1/2d. meat ration; no changes in the consumption of bacon, fish or eggs is expected in December and January.

Meat: (i) The outlook for meat, before taking account of any delay in arrivals from Australia and New Zealand, was unfavourable since, with present rates of consumption, stocks of ration meat in cold store were forecast to fall from 112 thousand tons at end-November to approximately 70 thousand tons at end-January.

(ii) As from 29th December the consumption of carcase meat will be reduced by meeting 2d. out of the 1/2d. weekly ration by issues of corned beef.

Bacon: Bulk stocks of bacon suitable for the ration were still at the very low level of about 2 weeks&apos; supply at the end of November. There was, however, a very rapid increase in stocks in the early weeks of December.

Fish: (i) Increased releases of wet salted ? and arrivals of pickled herrings made it possible for the estimated total consumption of fish to be as high in November as in October. No decline in consumption is expected over the winter months.

(ii) An expansion of the stocks of canned fish is expected in the immediate future.

Eggs: (i) The October-November rate of distribution to non-priority consumers, 2 eggs per head per month, is expected to continue during December and January. Priority consumers should receive 8 eggs per month in December and January.

(ii) Dried flake eggs are being packed for domestic consumption.

Cheese: Delayed shipments of cheese from the Southern Dominions would quickly reduce bulk stocks which amounted to 9 weeks&apos; supply at end-November and are expected to increase to 10 weeks&apos; supply by end-December.
- PROTECTIVE !Dotal milk consumption in November, including the liquid milkFOODS lent of condensed milk distributed by dairymen,, was little below October .:consumption; green vegetables were in short supply but root vegetables ;   1were, plentiful;    canned fruit and vegetables will be distributed in the&apos;new year through., the points rationing scheme.Milk:      :  -       .   (i) Gonsumption^of liquid milk&quot;in November, estimated at86 million gallons, was 9 million gallons belowOctober consumption but the liquid milk equivalent ofcondensed&apos; milk delivered by dairymen   in NQvember isestimated at 7i million gallons.(ii) It is estimated that priority requirements for liquid milk, which are. believed&apos; to be fairly fully taken up, represent kfjfa of total consumption,(iii)&apos; The quantity of . condensed milk available for non-priority consumers is expected to be sufficient fora total of 3 tins per head in these two.months, ascompared with 1 tin per;head in November,(iv) - If arrivals of .condensed milk reach present expectation-tations, stocks.will be maintained during december and January,(v) Dried milk is. being issued to hospitals, schoolsiaiid.institutions ^to, make up for a deficiency of liquid..!;Tnilk.   In December 15 million -g- lb. tins of driedmilk will, be,.,available .for the public, enabling eachhousehold to&quot; re-ceive one tin.(i) About half the total expected arrivals of 30 thousand tons of apples, from.Canada had reached this country by mid-December,&quot;The arrangements for importingdessert apples from the II, S, A, have been cancelled,(ii) Greenstuffs were generally in short&quot;supply in &apos;November and the ^shortage may become worse in the spring.   Root vegetables were plentiful.(iii) It will not be possible to distribute the full 2 lb,of onions per head as was originally intended.Canned fruit &amp;    Stocks of canned fruit, canned tomatoes and canned peasvegetables: are, to be distributed in ;thc early months -of;-1942 throughthe points, rationing,-scheme.   Canned tomatoes will beaixectod&apos;ih^jfty &quot;into-mixilng. and industrial areas.gresh fruit &amp;vegetables,OTHER&quot;COMDDITIES/ANIMALFEEDINGSTUFFSSweet   &apos; -&apos; There are difficulties in maintaining the present rate ofpreserves: jam production but during the ,8 weeks beginning 12thJanuary consumption of jam and marmalade will be reducedby increasing the proportion of syrup in the preservesration from one-sixth to,a(quarter.Tea;    . &apos; Total stocks of. tea-which normally expand at this periodof the year increased, from 72 to 77 thousand tons inNovember and are forecast; at 101 thousand tons at end-January,Coffee; -At the beginning of January full control of supplies of coffee will be instituted, present consumption is esti-mated to be about 7G^-.above?3he pre-war level,&quot;total stocks at end-November represent almost a year&apos;s supply at the present, rate of consumption.The requirements of the ration scheme for December and January are estimated at about 200 thousand tons of cereal and 70 thousand tons ofprotein feeding stuffs per month. It is expected that these demands canbe &quot;met with very small issues of maize and without a serious reduction inoilcake stocks,- k.
Cold Storage:Retail prices:Rationing:Britishrestaurants:enforcement of Pood Orders:VI. DISTRIBUTION &apos; AAbout J8fa of cold storage space was utilised during november.    Stores in inland areas have been stocked to capacity leaving considerable empty space in London and inthe principal ports.The Ministry of labour&apos;s index of retail food prices(July 1914 s100) stood at 165 on 1st December,   There hasbeen no change for tyro months,(i) The change in the meat ration on 29th December has been referred to.above,(ii) The points scheme for canned meals, which came intoforce on 1st December, has been amended, in the lightof experience, by increasing the points value of canned salmon and reducing that of canned sausage meat.The latter is a novel product on the British market.(iii) The next development of points rationing will be theinclusion of canned fruit, canned tomatoes and cannedpeas.(iv) The scheme for the free distribution to children under  years of age of cod liver oil and black currant.. syrup or puree came into operation on 8th December.The number of British Restaurants and other meal centres in operation at 30thNovember was 1,1 AO.    During November65 new centres were opened.    Meals are now available for519,000 miners at 582 collieries, 26 of which have full ;canteen facilities.Convictions secured in October, 2887, were the highest yetrecorded.   An Order in Council has been made increasing theformer maximum penalties for sales at too high a price by afurther fine not exceeding three times that price.    The Orderin Council also enables the Minister to make Orders providingfor the&apos; seizure of goods in respect of which an offence isbelieved to have been committed.W,- 5 -
