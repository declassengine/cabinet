30 wMONTHLY REPORT FOR SEPTEMBER,  19k1.FAR EAST.The administration of the freezing order against Japanby the United States Government has &quot;been much stricter than was expected.No new export licenses are to he granted for any goodson the U.S. Export License List, except petroleum products.In this case licenses may he granted for the qualities and up tothe quantities exported to Japan in 1935/36.     The export ofcottonj which with wheat is now almost the only commodity ofimportance not on the export license list, will he controlled byFinance licensee and limited to a maximum of 600,000 dollarsper month.But Japan will only be able to purchase petroleum products and cotton if she can find means of paying for them.      So far the U.S. Treasury have laid down almost impossible conditions forthe release of funds, and, since the imposition of the freezing&apos;order, no quantities of either commodity have, in fact, been shipped.&apos;The present practice of the U,S, Government is, therefore,a complete, if not permanent embargo on all exports to Japan.The Dutch Government too,following the formula adopted bythe Empire Governments, have decided to permit no trade betweenthe Netherlands East Indies and Japan, except special transaction-tions designed to secure essential imports.     The commodities and quantities which, for this purpose, they might be prepared to export have been fixed.     None could in any way augment japanese war potential.His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Governmenthave made a joint arrangement for the pre-emption of rubber inThailand,U.S.A. AND LATIN AMERICA.Joint Anglo-United States negotiations with the Argentinefor wolfram, quebracho and hides have continued.

This question was being discussed with the state department, when without warning us, they informed the french authorities that the tanker &quot;LORRAINE&quot; would be allowed to sailwith 7*500 tons of fuel oil.     In&quot; tho circumstances, we had no alternative but to fall in line and issue the necessary navicerts./ Suggested
- 2 -MONTHLY REPORT (Contd);Suggested quotas for shipments to French North Africa ofgoods other than oil products for the last quarter of 191+1 have&quot;been&quot;communicated to H.M. Embassy in Washington.Tentative suggestions have been put forward by the UnitedStates Government for trade with French West Africa.      We have laid down a number of conditions,, including tho pre-emption by theU.S.A. of the whole of the West African ground nut crop, amountingto some 2+50,000 tons.      If this could be arranged the enemy wouldbe cut off ,from one of his most important sources of edible oils and a serious leak in the blockade would be stopped.EUROPEAN NEUTRALS.An offer has been made to the Spaniards to release twoof the three ships,; recently seized, in return for&quot; an undertaking that, in future, no pyrites will be shipped from Huelva or Malaga,even to another Spanish port without.our prior consent.    the seizure of the cargoes of these ships remains effective, -and, evenif the Spaniards accept our offer, the two ships will have to pro-ceed to a port selected by us to discharge tho cargoes.     Thethird ship will in no circumstances be released as it was actuallysailing to an enemy port when intercepted.The Swedish Government has asked for our consent to thedespatch to Finland of medical supplies.
