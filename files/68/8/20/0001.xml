--y^DOCUI-SSI-T IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)COPY I^TO,WAR CA3IKST.THE GOAL POSITION,;[QNjPHLY REPORT BY THE SECRETARY FOR MIMES COVERING FEBRUARY,  1941(Previous Report: Paper W.P.(R)(4l)l5.) 1The usual tables in regard to production, distribution and stocks are appended, end call for little dexailed comment other thana reference to the effects of the very heavy snow fall in the Northduring the latter part of February.    This gravely dislocated rail and road transport, and production in the Northumberland and Durhamcoalfields fell from 704,000 tons in the week ended 15th February to431,000 tons and 491,000 tons in the two following weeks.    The wholeprogramme of special coal trains from these coalfields to lancashire and the South was seriously upset, making it impossible for the mines Department to reap the full advantage of the complete priorityaccorded to it for the month of February for some 150 trains a week from the Midlands and the North for stations on the Great WesternRailway.    The resultant shortage of gas coal brought many gasundertakings in the south of England to a dangerous position but,partly due to an improvement in the wagon supply to the Midlands andpertly to very good deliveries by sea to the South Coast,  an actualstoppage was everywhere averted.It now seems reasonable to expect that no further serious difficulty in meeting current consumption will be experienced this winter,  and attention is being directed to the preparations againstthe contingencies of next winter.    In a memorandum recently submittedto the Lord President&apos;s Coal Committee it was estimated that therewould still be nearly 15 million tons of coal in consumers&apos;  and merchants&apos;  hands and in Government dumps at the end of March, and itwas suggested that every effort should be made during the nextseven months to raise this to 39 million tons.    A copy of the detailed estimates of consumption during the 6 months to30th September and of the stocks to be built up is appended(Table XII)-Assuming that the whole of the normal stocking period to theend of October will be available for this pur-pose,  an average weeklyproduction (allowing for holidays aggregating one week during theperiod)  of 4,500,000 tons will be needed,  as compared with a recentoutput of less than 4 million tons.This programme was approved by the Lord President of the council as representing no more than a reasonable provision,  and its implications as regards man-power,  the supply of mining materials(especially steel and timber) and transport by rail,  sea,  canal and road, as well as many financial aspects are now being explored.In particular the magnitude of the effort needed to raise production to a weekly average of 4,500,000 tons will be appreciated when it isstated that this figure was last reached in the week ended27th July, 1940, when the number of wage-earners on colliery booksv&apos;as 759,500,  as compared with the present strength (1st March)of 693,600.    The first essential is obviously to stop the steady-loss of men from the industry and to concentrate on making the most: . fR)(4l)20.-&apos;; March, 1941.
effective use cf the existing labour force.    There is undoubtedlyroom for improvement in the output per man, absenteeism in some areas being at e high level, but it will proofbly be necessary a.lso to transfer miners to other areas, voluntarily&apos; or compulsoriEven so, it is unlikely that the desired output can be obtaineddthouc a substantial increase in the number of men employed.IXF0RT8.. .....The prospects for exports during the next six months are farfrom good, the total included under, this head in Table XII beingpnly mill j on tons in addition to 2,500,000 tons of foreign bunkJJven t:-.is tonnage is unlikely to be reached without subsidy. Penthe formulation and approval of a definite scheme, the Treasury hagreed, in principle, that assistance may meantime be given inrespect of certain markets if the necessary shipping facilities aavailable,-; -In order to enable some of the valuable anthracite trade witCanada to be retained during the coming shipment season,- theanthrac-f f.e producers in South Wales have been promised a subsidy of 5s,/ per ton and the maintenance of last season&quot; s freight rate10s. per ton..    Last jeez- this trade amounted to over one- million tons., bux en present indications it seems unlikely that much morethan half that tonnage will be available from South Wales thisseason.
