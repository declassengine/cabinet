MONTHLY REPORT FOR JULY,  194-1.During the month of July the most conspicuousdevelopments in the economic war have &quot;beenretaliatory measures against Japan, following heroccupation of Indo-China; progress in the supply ofmaterials for Russia and notably increased activity on the part of the U.S.A.The &quot;French leak&apos;, the relative importance ofwhich has increased since the Russian war closed the trans-Siberian route, has become no worse. . .Thereis still no general agreement for provisioning french north Africa,  and although two ships have sailed,French efforts to obtain the release of furtherships in American waters have been successfully resisted.    Moreover,  trade between the French west indies and Africa has been stopped (althoughnegotiations for its renewal are on foot),  and Frenchsailings between the Far East and Europe1have beenreduced.    The occupation of Syria has made it possibleto control the export of dangerous commodities,especially wool, from that country.The remaining European neutrals, notably Sweden,Spain and Switzerland, have suffered from furtherenemy pressure.    There has so far been no change in1I.M.G-. &apos; s policy towards *Sweden and the Gothenburgroute has been reopened. Efforts to assist Spain with her difficulties (largely difficulties of transport)in filling her import quotas, have been abated as aresult of General Franco&apos;s speech, but our generalpolicy towards Spain also remains unchanged.In Switzerland,  the increase of German control,exemplified by the prohibition of exports of merchandise by mail,  the new Swiss-German commercial agreement and the closure of the route from switzerland through Unoccupied Prance will necessitate a change in our policy.    We shall probably restrict imports to Switzerland to the minimum consistent withmaintaining diplomatic relations and upholding the swiss will to resist complete domination.Supplies of strategic materials,  includingrubber,  tin, wool,  lead,   jute, boots,  cobalt,industrial diamonds and shellac,  are already on their way to Russia, while certain Russian exports havealready been received here.

- p -of some difficulty followed owing to conflictingreports as to the manner in which the United StatesGovernment were going to exercise the powers theyhad taken,  and fears were expressed in the press and elsewhere that the freezing regulations wouldbso administered as to cause little change in theprevious situation.    Though some important pointsare still obscure, particularly with regard to the quantities of oil and cotton which Japan Will beable to buy in the United States under the new system,   it is hoped that the situation will soon be cleared up.U.S.A. and In addition to the freezing of Japanese assets,  theGouth America       u.S.
