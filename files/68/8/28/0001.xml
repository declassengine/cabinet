Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1941.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (R) (41) 28.April 18, 1941.WAR CABINET.IMPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF A^g -1941 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES, PROTECTORATES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE  DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.1. General Position.INTEREST inside the Dominion continues to be concentrated on war production. The campaign for a National Government, reported in last month&apos;ssummary, has now died down, owing in part to a strong reaction against it byt lie French Canadian press, but primarily to the refusal of the conservative opposition to participate in such a Government. Nevertheless, in the words ofthe Vancouver Sun, &quot;we are fumbling and bickering, still floating on the tideof personal ambitions and political rivalries, and still failing to concentrate onthe question of whether we survive.&quot; The demand for reform in the Dominion&apos;swar effort is now concentrated more on the technical side of aircraft productionand shipbuilding. For the former it has been proposed that a supreme executive .should be appointed to control the aircraft industry under the Minister ofMunitions and Supply. With the mounting total of shipping losses in the atlantic towards the end of the month, however, press criticism has been diverted to a campaign for the intensification of shipbuilding programmes.The other main preoccupation during the month has been the gradualprogress in the identification of the United States with the war effort againstGermany. The Lease and Lend Act was heralded with delight, but Canadianopinion has been somewhat concerned by the implications for the Canadian wheatindustry of the sale of United States food-stuffs to Great Britain. A feeling-persists that the Canadian war effort has not been properly recognised, and needsmore emphasis, and it has been pointed out in reply to alleged remarks in theBritish press that Canada&apos;demanded cash for her war supplies to Great Britainwhile the United States gave help freely, that sterling bought by Canadaamounted to a loan and not a payment. Nevertheless, Canadian co-operationwith the United States has been shown during the month by the signature of the st. Lawrence Waterway Treaty, which has been welcomed by all sections ofopinion except the Conservative Gazette and certain non-liberal FrenchCanadian newspapers.Mr. Wendell Willkie&apos;s recent visit to Canada was said to have beenenormously &apos;&apos; successful.Press comment on the world situation shows no remarkable development.Olose attention has been paid to recent developments in the Balkan situation and&apos;^orth African situation, but there is no sign of any undue perturbation.Lord Halifax&apos;s speech on war aims regarded as a &quot;splendid contrast&quot; toHitler&apos;s New Order.   Criticism continues to be offered on the position of Eire,[22430] b
one paper stating that &quot; it was better for Eire to be &apos; occupied &apos; by England than&apos; protected&apos; by Germany.&apos;&apos; French Canadian opinion has shown itself strongly opposed to Admiral Darlan&apos;s dubious activities.Mr. Malcolm MacDonald has arrived at Ottawa to take up his post as HighCommissioner for the United Kingdom.2. Naval, Military and Air Activities.The March output of air crews from the Empire Air Training Scheme inCanada was 739, of whom 571 (216 pilots. 149 observers and 206 wirelessoperator/ail- gunners) were sent to the United Kingdom.The strength of the R.C.A.F. is now over 50,000.The total burden of Canada&apos;s direct and indirect war effort from April 1941to March 1942 has been stated by Mr. Mackenzie King to amount to over-$5,000 million and to represent 44 per cent, of the estimated national income overthe same period.3. Economic Activities.Nothing of importance to record.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.4. General Position.The statement made by the Advisory War Council on the 13th Februaryabout the situation in the Pacific was reflected in the political situation, which,at the beginning of the month, was &quot; almost unnaturally quiet,&quot; and anoutspoken speech by the Minister of Customs, in which he stressed the need forsevere import restrictions, went practically without comment. The onlydisturbance in the calm was caused by Mr. Menzies&apos;s speech in London on the3rd March, in which he indicated his conception of better relations with Japan.His statement had a mixed reception in Australia, since it was considered insome respects to be eontradictoiw to the Advisory War councils statement onthe 13th February. On the other hand, the Melbourne Age said that the speechwas a &quot; masterly declaration of the true Australian mind, robust yet conciliatory,firm but persuasive, which should powerfully reinforce sobering influences in the pacific.&apos;&quot; Other press comment was that Australians want &quot;unambiguousJapanese friendship, but not sophistries.&quot; The discussion subsided withMr. Menzies&apos;s explanation of his meaning, and the detente was furtheremphasised by a conciliatory speech made by the new Japanese Minister. Certainpapers, however, pointed out that Mr. Akiyama&apos;s speech coincided with an offensive Japanese broadcast about Australian forces in Malaya, and also withthe presence of Mr. Matsuoka in Berlin. These facts may have led to the demandfor direct Commonwealth representation in China, as an offset to the recentappointment of an Australian Minister to Japan.A very warm welcome was accorded to the visit of the American cruiser squadron under Admiral Newton, described as &quot; an impressive demonstration of american naval power in the Pacific particularly intended for foreign consump-tion.&quot; The feeling of armed security was increased by Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s speech onthe 17th March, though the Catholic press did not fail to point out the economic implications of the Lease and Lend Act.A positive contribution was made to the internal political lull by the enlarge-ment of the Advisory War Council to include two members of the Opposition, andthe Labour Party rejected a proposed motion of censure. Nevertheless, harmonywas broken towards the end of the month by a stoppage in the New South Walesmining industry, with a further threat of a general strike, caused by a Govern-ment postponement of legislation for miners&apos; pensions. By an amendment of theNational Security Regulations the Governor-General has been empowered toappoint conciliation officers where necessary for the preservation of peace in industry.The Australian public is not yet entirely sensible of the need for economy,and the month ended with a last-minute scramble by motorists to cash theirsurplus petrol coupons, in spite of Government appeals for a more patrioticattitude.
Tine Labour Government of Mr. Forgan Smith lias been returned, for thefourth time, in the General Election held in Queensland on the 29th March. TheElection held at the same time in South Australia has resulted in the return ofthe present Liberal-Country Party, with a clear majority.5. Naval, Military and Air Activities.A large number of meetings was arranged during the month for Mr. Menzies,ihe commonwealth Prime Minister, with United Kingdom Ministers, with whom he discussed the various aspects of the war effort, with particular regard toAustralians part in it. Mr. Menzies has attended meetings of the War Cabinet,made a tour of factories and bombed areas and visited Northern Ireland and Eire.A United States naval squadron of two cruisers and five destroyers visitedSydney and Brisbane.A Netherlands East Indies Mission, headed by the Netherlands East IndiesChief of General Staff, visited Australia for discussion of matters arising fromthe Anglo-Dutch-Australian Conference at Singapore.A Volunteer Defence Corps is being formed in Australia as an adjunct toflie Australian Military Forces.Australian troops have been engaged against the Germans in Northern(J reece.6. Economic Activities.Discussions have taken place between Air. Menzies and United kingdom ministers, covering generally the financial and economic aspects of the Common-wealth war effort, shipping and related problems, and the effect on Australianagricultural industries of the enforced reduction in our imports of foodstuffsfrom Australia. The need for further economy in dollar expenditure, for reduction in consumption of non-essential goods and for &quot; belt-tightening &quot;generally has been impressed on Mr. Menzies, and an offer has been made to him under which, in order to avoid damage to Australians war effort consequent onthe present shipping difficulties, the United Kingdom Government will shareequally with the Commonwealth Government the burden of financing Australianssurpluses of agricultural products.NEW ZEALAND.7. General Position.New Zealand has never been so greatly concerned with the Pacific &quot; crisis &quot;as Australia, and public opinion in New Zealand continues to be principallyexercised over the difficulties of exporting butter and meat. The new danger to New Zealand exports is, of course, the lack of shipping caused by the mountingcasualties in the Atlantic. Nevertheless, in common with other Dominions,New Zealand did not fail to notice the latent implications of the Lease and LendAct. which was otherwise whole-heartedly welcomed. In this connection areorientation of New Zealand trade towards Australia has been forecast in thepress, which contrasts the rapid industrial development of Australia with new Zealand&apos;s dependence on primary production.New Zealand interest in the war has been increased by the news of the concentration of her forces in the Middle East, and local interest stimulated bythe partial &quot;blackout&apos;&apos; in coastal areas and by other emergency precautions.Following an official lead, the press &quot; soft pedalled &quot; the visit of the United Statescruiser squadron, and generally refrained from speculation regarding the significance of the visit except purely as one of goodwill.The whispering campaign from London about the possible repatriation of australian and New Zealand Government loans seems to have been dropped.The Prime Minister has confirmed the news of his forthcoming visit to theUnited Kingdom.For the rest, New Zealand comment on events in the Balkans, the-Mediterranean and Africa has, to a large extent, followed official guidance.[22430] b 2
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.10. General Position.The month has been marked by the continuation of the internal struggle inthe Opposition parties, whose usual aggressive attitude towards the Allied causeseems to persist, though it is, perhaps, not so definitely sympathetic with the nazi cause.Two events on the 6th March illustrate this tendency. The first was a speechby Dr. Malan at Cape Town, when he made a determined effort to maintain his personal position against the growing influences of Mr. Pirow and the ossewa brandwag. Dr. Malan described in this speech the English-speaking section ofthe Union as a &quot;British Fifth Column&quot;; but his more positive contributionseems to have been an appeal for a return to some form of &quot; Krugerism &quot;; i.e.,a purified Christian democratic nationalist Republic. In these efforts to formulate a more definite policy against the growing nazism of Mr. Pirow am!Dr. van Rensburg, he was supported, as the month went on, by Mr. Strydom.Leader of the Reunited Party in the Transvaal, and a personal rival of Mr. Pirow.A more important ally, however, was the Calvinist Section of the Dutch-speakhmpopulation, who came out with a strong denunciation both of Liberalism or &quot; falsedemocracy,&quot; and National Socialism. This section now envisages the establish-ment of a Republic through a free vote at a peace conference attended by aweakened England, or even after a total German victory. Other questions areconveniently left out of account.On the same day, the 6th March, the first congress of the new AfrikanerParty was held at Bloemfontein, when Mr. Havenga was elected as Deputy (and active) Leader of the Party.The Government are to some extent the gainers from the struggle betweenthe rival opposition parties of General Hertzog and Dr. Malan; but oppositionsupport is being increasingly given to the extremist non-Parliamentary OssawaBrandwag movement. The Malanites defeated the Afrikaner (Hertzog)candidates in the former constituencies of General Flertzog and Mr. Havenga inspite of support for the latter from the Government which had withdrawn itscandidates.Opposition weakness, coupled with recent Allied military successes, have led to comparative peace for the Government, and there was no comment on theGovernment communique reporting the employment of the South African seawarddefence force in the Mediterranean, and little on the fining of two NationalistM.Ps. and others implicated in a riot at which Mr. Lawrence, Minister of theInterior, was injured. In external affairs, even the Opposition was deeplyimpressed by the passage of the Lease and Lend Act, and the confidence withwhich President Roosevelt ranged himself on the side of the Allies was noted.New Zealand troops form part of the British Empire Forces in NorthernGreece.An R.N.Z.A.F. Cadet Corps and a Women&apos;s Auxiliary Air Force haverecently been instituted.9. Economic Activities.Representations have been received from the New Zealand government regarding the effect on the internal economy of the Dominion of the severereduction now contemplated as a result of shipping difficulties in United kingdom imports of New Zealand meat and dairy products. An offer has now been madeto the New Zealand Government to deal with this problem on the same lines asthose contemplated in the case of Australia after discussion with Mr. Menzies.namely, that the United Kingdom Government should share equally with theNew Zealand Government the burden of financing New ZealancVs agriculturalsurpluses.
NEWFOUNDLAND.13. General Position.The Agreement with the United States Government relating to the basesleased to the United States in Newfoundland and elsewhere was signed on the27th March. A Protocol was at the same time signed by plenipotentiaries of theGovernments of Canada, the United Kingdom and the United. States, in whichit was recognised that the defence of Newfoundland is an integral feature of theCanadian scheme of defence and, as such, a matter of special concern to theCanadian Government; and that, in all consultations concerning Newfoundlandarising out of the Articles of the Agreement involving considerations of defence,the Canadian Government as well as the Government of Newfoundland will havethe right to participate. The Governor of Newfoundland reported on the29th March that the Agreement had so far received a very favourable press in newfoundland and that the public reaction was in a helpful and patriotic spirit.14. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.A small further batch of recruits for the Newfoundland Heavy Artillery andfor the Royal Air Force ground staff left Newfoundland during the month15. Economic Activities.A new sulphite pulp mill, which has been in course of construction in newfoundland by the Bowater Company, was opened by the Governor on the20th March, a month ahead of the schedule. The local press stressed the factthat most of the machinery was of United Kingdom origin and had beentransported overseas without mishap.The Newfoundland Government have been asked if they can supply a furthercontingent of 400 loggers for service here, subject to the terms of engagementbeing tightened up in some respects.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.16. General.A Rhodesian Divisional Reconnaissance Unit has been formed in EastAfrica.EIRE.17. General Position.There is very little to record since last month&apos;s Report. There have been no new developments of importance in the political field. On the economic side Eireis now feeling the pinch of wartime restrictions in all directions, especially asregards raw materials for her industries. There is a general shortage of allimported materials, especially petrol and goods made of iron and steel. industries in Eire are slowing down and unemployment is growing.  As regards food, thereUnion land and air forces have continued to play a very prominent part inthe operations against the Italians in East Africa and Ethiopia.General Smuts has recently restated in Parliament the position in regardhi the employment of Union troops outside the Union. He said that he regardedhimself as strictly bound by the terms of the resolution of September 1939, thatho proposed after the Ethiopian campaign was over to send South African troops to Egypt, and that if circumstances necessitated their employment outside Africano would ask Parliament to amend the resolution. If Parliament was not in session at the time be would summon it for the purpose.12. Economic Activities.Nothing of importance to record.
is an acute shortage of wheat, which has made the brown wartime loaf general,and the tea ration has had to be further reduced to \ oz. per week.Ministers are unanimous in emphasising the gravity of the supplies situationbut on the whole public opinion has not so far attributed the present difficulties todeliberate action on the part of the United Kingdom Government. Indeed, when mr. de Valera stated that &quot; Ireland is effectively blockaded by both sides,&quot; therecame from Senator Douglas a protest which was endorsed by SenatorMacDermott. However, the recent reduction in the Eire tea ration has causedMr. Lemass, the Minister of Supplies, to comment: &quot; These reductions have beenattributed by the British tea control to shipping difficulties and to the loss ofsupplies. I am no longer able to accept that explanation as adequate. The alloca-tions made by the British tea control to wholesalers in Great Britain have no;been reduced.&quot; He stated that allocations in this country were 85 per cent, of normal compared with 25 per cent, in Eire. The Eire Government have alsoprotested to us against the decision to reduce wartime deliveries of petrol to eire to 50 per cent, of the pre-war level on the ground that commercial and private consumption in this country is only reduced by 33-g per cent. They havebeen informed that, in our view, the circumstances of the two countries are not comparable, since the United Kingdom is and Eire is not engaged on activehostilities. In particular, existing conditions here have made an extensive use of road transport essential.As recorded in the previous summary, Mr. Aiken is still in the United Statesof America endeavouring to secure supplies of arms, ships, wheat and raw-materials. Mr. Menzies visited Dublin in the first week in April for interviews with Mr. de Valera.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.18. Political Situation.(i) Mr. Gandhi&apos;s anti-war campaign of civil disobedience has now entered the &quot; third stage,&apos;&quot; which involves the rank and file of the Congress Party. (The&quot;first stage&quot; up to the 6th January- was restricted to the most prominentmembers of Congress, including ex-Ministers and Members of Legislatures; andthe &quot; second stage &quot; embraced representatives on Provincial Committees and localbodies.) During the month the movement has been mainly concentrated in theUnited Provinces, where it is reported that the rural areas are being affected and that some attempts have been made to interfere with war work. In other provinces there has been evidence of the discouraging effect of the policy ofignoring nonentities and of imposing fines without the option of imprisonment.Cases of satyagraha performed under coercion have come to notice. Publicinterest generally is still reported to be low.(ii) The constitutional deadlock persists, and there is now no room for doubtthat Parliaments approval of a Resolution to retain in being the powers underwhich seven Provinces have been administered by their Governors since theresignations of their Ministries will have to be sought before the end of Aprilwhen the present powers expire. Meantime, some public interest has been evokedby the proceedings at Bombay of a conference of about 40 non-party political leaders, almost exclusively Hindu, over which the Rt. Hon. Sir T. B. Saprnpresided.  They invited Government (a) to make an immediate declaration that India is to achieve dominion status on a fixed date after the war;(b) to substitute existing members of the Governor-General&apos;s ExecutiveCouncil by a corresponding number of non-official Indians draAvnfrom important elements in the public life of the country;(c) during the war to make no change in the constitutional position of theGovernment of India, which should remain responsible to HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, but to entrust an indian with the portfolio of Defence subject to nothing being doneduring the war to prejudice the position of the Commander-in-Chiefas executive head of the Army in India;
(d) to provide for the Government so reconstructed dealing with all important matters on a basis of joint and collective responsibility andnot merely as departmental chiefs.(iii) The point was made at the Conference that without a coalition betweenCongress and the Moslem League a Government formed on these lines couldcommand no support in the Legislature. Although the Conference^ Resolutionshad a moderately friendly reception in the Congress press, there is at present no evidence that the Moslem League would accord them any support as an alternative to the &quot; Pakistan &quot; scheme for setting up Moslem &quot; States &quot; with a wide measureof autonomy in the Provinces in which Moslems are in majority. A prominentMoslem described the Conference in a speech in the Indian Assembly as &quot;ameeting of mice to bell the cat.&quot;19. Military Affairs.(i) The Government of India have now agreed to supply a Field Company,S. and M., for Burma, in addition to the Brigade Group and 2 Mountain Batteriesalready being sent.(ii) The movement of the division from India to Malaya is now in progress.(iii) The Government of India have been asked to supply a Corps Head-quarters for the two Indian Divisions which, with the arrival of the Divisionmentioned above, will be in Malaya.(iv) The Government of India have now agreed to provide a total of 37labour companies for the Middle East by June 1941. They have also agreed toreport in two months&apos; time whether they will be able to raise a further 39eompanies required for the Middle East.20. Foreign and Frontier Relations.(i) Afghanistan. His Majesty&apos;s Minister has approached the AfghanGovernment for permission to start a British air service between Kabul andLahore, and the Afghan Foreign Minister is to bring the matter before theAfghan Cabinet. He pointed out, however, that the Afghan Government had recently refused a Japanese request for a service to Kabul via India and Iran,ami this would make it difficult for them to agree to a British service, and hehad also heard that Germany might request permission to restart the Lufthansaservice, and it would be very difficult for the Afghans to refuse this request ifthey had agreed to a British service. The Minister does not think that theAfghan Government will agree to the establishment of a British service duringthe Avar.The Minister also had a long interview with the Afghan Prime minister on the 19th March, at which he expressed the disappointment of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment with the recent attitude of the Afghan Government and their failure to implement their professions of friendliness as shown by such developments asthe increasing dominance of German experts in the economic and educationalfields, the refusal by the Afghan Government of various offers of assistance madeto them by Flis Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India in theeconomic, agricultural and other spheres and in the limitations recently placed&quot;it the circulation of the Legation bulletin. The Prime Minister protestedsomewhat indignantly against the accusation of unfriendliness, and claimed that since the war began he had clone everything possible to ensure the neutrality of afghanistan and the peace of the border; allowance should be made for hisdifficulties which were partly due to Afghan fear of Russia; he could not breakexisting contracts with Germany, but he had not entered into any fresh contracts and would not allow increased penetration. While admitting the existence ofGerman propaganda, he claimed that it was under control and had no effect onAfghan sentiment, and he could not allow any increase in British propaganda.He stated that his policy would not change, and that he would give an absoluteguarantee to His Majesty&apos;s Government that, provided Afghanistan is notinvaded by armed forces, the Afghan attitude would not, while he was alive, be a cause of embarrassment to the British Government during the war.   The Minister
considers that this interview has, to some extent, cleared the air, and recommends that we should support the Prime Minister and accept his guarantee, providedthat he allows no further infiltration of Germans, and that we should nowcontinue economic relations, starting with an offer for the purchase of Afghancotton and wool.(ii) North-Went Frontier. The situation in Waziristan has maintained animprovement and has been generally satisfactory. Propaganda is, however, beini;spread to the effect that the Faqir of Ipi intends to start large-scale hostilities in the near future. An armed jffiotographic air reconnaissance has been carriedout of the Faqir of Ipi&apos;s headquarters. There has been one incident on theBannu border, where a gang ambushed a car. wounding a British officer andkilling the other occupants.   The remainder of the frontier has remained quiet.(iii) Persian Gulf. It is reported that the Berlin Arabic broadcasts are having a regrettable effect on public opinion. The passing, however, of the lease and Lend Bill and recent Greek successes have had an excellent effect.An American naval observe]- is shortly to be posted to Bahrein, where the sheikh has welcomed the appointment.21. Indian States.At the annual session of the Chamber of Princes at Delhi resolutions were passed in appreciation of the King-Emperors message to India regarding thewar services of the States and of British India, and the full support of the Princesto the British cause was reaffirmed. A message congratulating the PrimeMinister and His Majesty&apos;s Government on recent successes in the Middle east was also conveyed.The Chancellor of the Chamber has represented to the Viceroy the importance attached by the Princes to their association in discussions regarding the war effort as would be the case if the War Advisory Council were constituted.22. Economic.(i) Indian co-ojjeration in the exercise of economic pressure on Japan.A. summary of the action taken by the Government of India under this headwas contained in the Monthly Report for November 1940. Since that date theGovernment of India have agreed to restrict to normal all their exports to japan and Japanese-controlled territories where tighter restrictions are not already inforce. They have, however, made an exception in respect of raw cotton and coir,exports of which have been below normal and on which it is undesirable toimpose formal restrictions unless these are necessary to achieve our objective.Exports of manganese ore. which were restricted to normal in October, have nowbeen further restricted to well below normal.(ii) Establishment of a Customs Union between British India and the FrenchEstablishments in India.In the latter half of 1940 the Government of India were authorised to enterinto discussions with M. Bonvin, the Governor of the French Establishments inIndia who had declared for General de Gaulle, with a view to the negotiation of a customs union between British India and the French Establishments. these discussions have now resulted in an agreement which provides for the establishment of the British Indian customs regime in French India and the cession tothe Government of India of jurisdiction in the French territory in respect of customs and excise duties and light dues and matters cognate thereto. the proceeds of all such duties are to accrue to the Government of India, and in returnan annual subsidy of Rs. 6,20,000 is pajrable to the French Indian Government,The agreement is terminable on the 31st March, 1942, or on the same date inany subsequent year on the giving of 12 months&apos; notice by either party.23. Finance.Indian Budget.The Central Governments Budget was introduced in the Legislature on the28th February.    The following table summarises the figures, converted into
sterling, of the latest Revised Estimate for 1940-41 and of the Budget Estimate(on the basis of existing taxation) for 1941-42 : Revised BudgetEstimate, Estimate,1940-41. 1941-42.Revenue    million.        million.Customs       ...       ............      28-31 26-06Taxes on  Income  (Central  Share)  andCorporation Tax       ...      ...      ...      15-41 23-42Railways     ...............        7-47 7-64Other sources         ............      20-76 22-67Revenue Reserve Fund (balance of surplusof 1939-40)      ............        5-8377-78 79-79Expenditure Defence Services    ............      54-02 63-10Civil Expenditure............      30-08 32-0484 10 95-14Deficit ...............        6-32 15-35Revised Estimates, 1940-41.In addition to  5 - 83 million in the Revenue Reserve Fund, the latest estimates for 1940-41 showed an improvement over the Budget of that year of 3-16 million, mainly under Railways and Taxes on Income. Civil expenditureincreased by only  780.000, while Defence expenditure was  13-87 million higher.The total of  54 million for Defence includes  18^ million for India/s warmeasures.Budget, 1941-42.On the basis of existing rates the Central surcharge on Income-tax isexpected to yield  4-26 million and Excess Profits Tax  5-63 million, with anadditional carry-over of  0-75 million from 1940-41. Railways are expected tocontribute  7-64 million. Defence expenditure at  63-10 million includes 26-55 million for Indians war measures.The Provincial share of Income-tax is expected to increase from  2-80million in 1940-41 to  3-35 million in 1941-42. The latter year is the last year of the &quot; first prescribed period &quot; of Section 138 of the Government of India Act.The estimated sum to be received by the Provinces is far larger than they could have dared to hope for a year or two ago and this is in spite of the amendment(approved by Parliament) of the relevant. Order-in-Council, which was designedto prevent an unduly large share of war-time accretions of revenue from going tothe Provinces.Towards meeting the deficit of  15-35 million, new taxation measures,estimated to yield in 1941-42 the following amounts, are being imposed :    million.Excess Profits Tax increase from 50 per cent, to 66f per cent. 1 -88Central Surcharge on Income-tax and Super-tax : increase from i to i     .....................      1-42Matches Excise Duty to be doubled    ...      ...      ...      ...      1-13Artificial Silk Yarn and Thread increase of the alternative&quot;specific import duty from 3 annas to 5 annas a pound ... I ^Pneumatic Tyres and Tubes imposition of new 10 per cent, fad valorem excise duty4-96The prospective deficit is thus reduced to  10 - 39 million, which would be met by borrowing.   Though this is still a formidable figure, it must be borne in mind that the revenue estimates include  2J million for &quot; reduction or avoidance of debt&quot; (corresponding to Sinking Fund provision), and that any modification of[22430] c
the free-trade regime with Burma, as the outcome of negotiations now proceeding,must result in some increase in revenue.The fact that, of the potential deficit disclosed by this particular Budget,barely one-third is being met by new imposts, tends to give an unduly gloomypicture of the true position. The uncovered deficit may be regarded as the resultof extra expenditure of  30 million due to the war, coupled with net deterioration of ordinary revenue of  2-3 million, the total gap of  32-3 million being filledto the extent of  21-9 million by new taxation imposed during the war. ThusIndia is in 1941-42 expecting to meet more than two-thirds of her war expendi-ture from revenue.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.24. Gene ml.The internal situation continues to be quiet. The tension in the Far eastern situation earlier in the month had mainly the effect of hardening Burmesesentiment against aggression.On the 17th there was a strike of oil-field workers in Chauk, but most of the strikers have now returned to work.   The other oil-fields were not affected.There have also been strikes in two saw-mills at Rangoon, affecting Indianlabour only.Press and Public Opinion.The Burmese Press is pleased with the security measures taken by Britainand America to meet a possible conflagration in the Far East. Britain is urged to give all possible aid to Turkey and Greece, as. if Turkey were attacked, thewhole Islamic world would rise against the Axis.25. Defence.Work on the preparation of additional aerodromes is proceeding expedi-tiously. Guards for the aerodromes and R.A.F. dumps are being provided by the recruitment of 1.600 men divided between the Territorial and Frontier Forces andthe armed police.The first portion of the reinforcing Brigade from India arrived in Burma onthe 23rd March, and the movement is expected to be complete early in April.26. External Relations.Nothing to report.27. Economic Relations.(a) Internal.-Nothing to report.(b) External.- Discussions on a trade agreement with India are nearing completion. It is understood that agreement is likely to be reached on nearly all points.During February the number of lorries leaving and entering Burma by the china Road averaged 177 outwards and 180 inwards. Over 11,000 tons of goods were transported into China and over 8,000 tons imported from China.THE  COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors&quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)28. Military Affairs.(a) United States Bases.The agreement between the Governments of the United Kingdom and theUnited States of America relating to the bases leased to the United States was signed on the 27th March and has been published as Cmd. 6259.
(b) Far East.The question of making further calls on European manpower in Malaya forthe Army and Air Force has again come to the fore. The stage has been reachedwhere it is almost impossible to make further calls on European manpowerwithout dislocating the essential industries of tin and rubber. Every effort isbeing made to meet the needs of the Army and Air Force from other sources, andthe Governor of the Straits Settlements has been asked to discuss the problemfurther with the Commander-in-Chief, Far East. He will explore the possibilityof obtaining Europeans from neighbouring territories, such as Australia orCeylon, and he may be able to spare Europeans from certain Government Depart-ments not directly concerned with the Malayan war effort, but he has beeninformed that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not agree to any reduction in theoutput of tin and rubber except in the last resort. The Governor has also beenasked to ensure that the fullest possible use is made of Eurasian and Asiatic man-power wherever it is suitable.Reference was made in last month s report to a decision to close all ports inthe State of North Borneo other than Sandakan and Jesselton to foreign shipping.This decision has been further examined owing to protests received from theJapanese Government, but it has been decided, in the light of advice receivedfrom the Governor of the Straits Settlements, the Commander-in-Chief, Far East,and the Commander-in-Chief, China Station, to adhere to it.It has also been decided to increase the police force at the disposal of theNorth Borneo Government. In the neighbouring State of Brunei a smallvolunteer force has been instituted in addition to the similar forces in north borneo and Sarawak.29. Research into New Uses for Colonial Products.A scientific committee on alternative uses for Colonial products has been setup and has held its first meeting, at which it discussed such widely differentcommodities as sugar and raw materials for paper making. Its members includedistinguished scientific experts, and it is hoped that its recommendations will be concerned not only with long-term developments, but also with matters directlyinfluencing the war effort.30. Disposal of Colonial Products.The proposals of the High Commissioner for advances to Palestine citrusgrowers to maintain groves m cultivation for the 1941-42 season have beenapproved in principle.   The details are still under discussion with him.Reports on Particular Colonies.31. British Somaliland.British Somaliland has now been reoccupied and has for the time being beenplaced under military administration. A number of Colonial officers have beenmade available to assist the military authorities in the administration of the protectorate and the occupied Italian territories; an even larger number of such officers who were already serving with the military forces in East Africa are nowbeing employed in administrative duties.32. Sierra Leone.Mr. Wallace Johnson, the Sierra Leone agitator, has, on the strong recom-mendation of the Officer Administering, the Government, been placed again in detention on his release from prison, where he had been serving a sentence for criminal libel.33. Ceylon.The new Immigration Bill introduced by the Ministers into the state council, and referred to in last month&apos;s report, has turned out not to contain theunacceptable provisions against the admission of &quot; non-Ceylonese &quot; which were expected.The Ministers&apos; protest to the Governor against his message to the state council setting out the existing undertakings of Ceylon in the matter of thetreatment of Indians has been published, together with the Governors reply.I he Governor did not expect any deterioration in the local situation as a resultof publication.
34. Hong Kong.Sir Geoffry Northcote. the Governor, has resumed the administration of thegovernment.Part of the reserve stock of rice in the Colony has been found unfit for use.but it was expected that the deficiency would be made up by the end of March.New arrangements have been made for supervising the Colony&apos;s food stocks.35. Malaya and Borneo.Special steps have been taken and instructions sent to the Governor for thepurpose of restricting Japanese espionage opportunities in these territories. Inparticular, attention has been given to the problem of restricting the opportunities -ties of Japanese Consular Representatives and those travelling with diplomatic and official visas.36. Aden Protectorate.The Fadhli Sultan, whose headquarters are on the coast at Shuqra, 60 miles east of Aden, has been for some time past notorious for his oppressive treatmentof his people and his obstructive attitude to the Government at Aden. Followino-npon recent displays of defiance and rudeness to the Governor, he was summoned to go to Aden to give undertakings regarding his future conduct. He made falseexcuses and failed to obey, and has therefore been deposed following upon adisplay of military and air force at Shuqra. The Fadhli tribe have elected a successor.37. Palestine.There have been no political developments, but rumours regarding the mufti&apos;s intentions mentioned in last month&apos;s report continue, strengthened byreiterated though unfounded reports of his arrival in Syria and of his intentionto renew disturbances in Palestine simultaneously with a German advance. Theattitude of Turkey has done much to reassure doubters who saw in the german occupation of Bulgaria confirmation of their fear that the German driveeastward cannot be stayed. While there is general confidence in the Allies, thereis an undercurrent of uneasiness at the prospect that Balkan developments will bring the war unpleasantly close to Palestine. Local Arabs feel that this might result in a German coup de main arising out of recent disturbances in Syria,and the typical reaction is &apos;&quot; What is Britain going to do about it, and when?&quot;An inspired rumour that Mr. Eden secretly agreed to return Syria to the Turkshas had some adverse effect locally, and, as the rumour was consistent withArab suspicions, a dementi was not completely effective.Negotiations for a united front comprising all the Jewish community inPalestine are still proceeding actively. There are indications that the Revisionistparty is losing ground. Since his return to Palestine Mr. Ben Gurion hasaddressed large gatherings in several parts of the country on the theme that(a) Great Britain&apos;s heroic struggle should have the fullest support of Jewry,(b) Jewish unity is necessary to make the support effective, and the achievement of Jewish unity would entail a Jewish army fighting as one of the Allied armies,and (c) only complete unity of Jews will overcome the parochial obstructivenessof Palestine Arab nationalists to Zionist aspirations.Some Jewish leaders have shown renewed interest in Arab-Jewishco-operation, and there have been local instances of efforts towards establishinggood relations.Incidents of violence (mainly robbery) have been below the average even ofa normal year, and are without political significance. Confiscation of armscontinues steadily. Sabotage of the frontier fence has ceased for the time being,a contributory cause being the opening of new passages in the areas mostlyaffected and the co-operation of the French frontier authorities.Trans-Jordan remains normal.Great George Street, S.W. 1,April 18, 1941.
