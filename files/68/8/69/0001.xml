Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1941.Copy No.   49WAR CABINET.REPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 1941 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.- ?THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.(1)  General Position.DURING the month the pros and cons of a British invasion of the Continentwere much discussed. The publication of Lord Gorfs despatches has served to weaken the arguments in favour of this, but some support has been, given tothe alleged dissatisfaction and clamour in England. The despatches themselves have aroused mainly objective comment, though the Edmonton Journal thinks that lord Gort must himself accept a major share of responsibility for the shortageof equipment of which he complains.General Hertzog&apos;s pro-Nazi declaration aroused much attention.The United Kingdom High Commissioners remarks at a recent press conference in Canada, which were taken to imply the need for an intensifiedCanadian war effort, have led to press references to complacency in Ministerialminds at Ottawa. Editorial comment on Mr. Beverley Baxter&apos;s tour, duringwhich he spoke on the needs of conscription in Canada, has been generallydistinctly hostile.The private visit of the Duke of Windsor to his ranch received muchfavourable publicity, except in Quebec.The Canadian Government have decided to appoint a Minister to China,and several names have been canvassed by the press. This appointment isregarded by the press as betokening collaboration with Washington and anabandonment of the policy of appeasement of Japan.There has been continued gloom about the course of the fighting in Russia,and it is thought that the Caucasus will, be the major front during the coming winter. The United States move to clarify the question of religious freedom in Russia has been noted rather suspiciously by the French-Canadian press; other papers, however, printed full descriptions of recent religious services in Moscow.In the Far East, Japanese intentions have aroused further speculation,Burma being mentioned as probably the next intended victim. The United states policy oLavoiding any definite commitment in the Far East has been criticised.The horror of the executions in France has led to a complete reversal of theformer approval by the Canadian public of violent resistance in that country.[23179] bSECRETW.P. (R)        69.November 21, 1941.
Petain&apos;s sentences on political prisoners, and reports of strengthened ties between germany and Vichy, have received much attention. General de Gaulle&apos;s press conference was well reported in all the papers. Growing interest is expressedin the possibility of a separate peace with Italy, and Mr. Myron Taylor&apos;s visit to the Vatican has been linked with this. The Ottawa Journal, however, reminds-its readers that Italy shares her ally&apos;s international crimes. There have beenprotests at the decision that Canada shall not have a United States publicityoffice.The new wage and price control measures have found no favour with Labour,owing mainly to the absence of prior consultation with them. Increasingeconomic control by the Government is, however, being accepted generally as inevitable, and even, in some quarters, as preferable to voluntary restriction.Mr. Mackenzie King paid a visit to President Roosevelt at the end ofOctober and the press forecast further co-ordination of economies as a resultof the visit.Meanwhile, the special Cabinet sessions, which have been held since the PrimeMinister&apos;s return from London, have aroused widespread speculation, and important changes in war policy are believed to be under consideration, includingconscription, and safeguards against inflation.The Pattullo Government (Liberal) lost its majority in the British Columbiaprovincial elections and a Liberal-Conservative coalition is expected.Senator Arthur Meighen, the former Prime Minister, was elected leader ofthe Conservative party on the 10th November, in succession to Mr. Hanson.- This appointment will, it is felt, greatly strengthen the Conservative party.(2) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Three Canadian armed merchant cruisers are operating in the south atlantic and Pacific under Commander-in-Chief, America and West Indies.Approximately 13 Royal Canadian Navy destroyers and 52 corvettes were employed on North Atlantic convoy duty during October. 22 corvettes havebeen completed since July 1941, making a total of 54 already completed andin commission out of the original 80 called for.There are at present 31 shipbuilding firms in Canada engaged in theconstruction and repair of Royal Canadian Navy corvettes and minesweepers.507 R.C.N.V.R. officers are now serving on loan to the Royal Navy.Colonel Ralston, Minister of National Defence, and General Crerar, Chiefof the General Staff, were in England from the 13th to the 30th October and net the  Chiefs of Staff in discussion.The 3rd Canadian Division has been inspected by the Commander-in-Chief,Home Forces, General Sir Alan Brooke.The 2nd Armoured Brigade arrived from Canada on the 22nd October.More than 13,000 Canadian vehicles had been assembled by the Canadianmechanisation depot in the United Kingdom up to the 29th October.Air-Commodore L. P. Stevenson, Air Officer Commanding Royal CanadianAir Force in Great Britain, is returning to Canada shortly and will be replaced by Air Vice-Marshal H. Edwards.Two R.C.A.P. squadrons co-operated with the British and Canadian forces which took part in manoeuvres during the month.Nos. 401, 402 and 403 Fighter Squadrons have carried out offensive sweepsover enemy-occupied territory : No. 402 destroyed two- and No. 403 three enemy aircraft. No. 406 Night-fighter Squadron (Beaufighters) destroyed three enemy bombers, all of which were accounted for by the Wing Commander and hisSergeant Observer, who have been awarded the D.F.C. and D.F.M. No. 405Squadron (Wellingtons) has taken part in raids on Stettin, Hamburg (twice),Essen, Ostend, Nuremberg (twice), Duisburg, Wilhelsmhaven, Emden, Mannheim,Frankfurt and Le Havre. Only one aircraft has failed to return from all these operations. No. 407 Squadron (Hudsons) has been credited with about 51,000tons of enemy shipping sunk or damaged during the month. No. 413 Squadron(Catalinas) has been engaged continually on convoy escorts. One aircraft hasbeen lost.At the end of October, 16R.C.A.F. squadrons were either operating or wereformed in the United Kingdom. -In addition, large numbers of R.C.A.F. personnel are serving throughout the Royal&apos; Air Force.
(3) Economic Activities.Mr. Mackenzie King announced on the 19th October the canadian government&apos;s intention to impose comprehensive measures of price control andwage regulation. The broad policy is to put a ceiling to prices and charges for services at the maximum rates current about the beginning of October, and to stabilise present basic wage rates, supplementing them by a cost-of-living bonusadjusted regularly by the Government. The administrative machinery for these controls is now being developed, and the many problems arising have occupiedmuch of the attention of the Canadian Cabinet and Departments concerned. Thepolicy has had a good reception in Canada.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.(4) General Position.Mr. Curtin, who inaugurated his accession to the Premiership with a cordialtelegram to Mr. Churchiil promising full co-operation, has since voiced the determination of his party to bring about victory. In a speech to MelbourneTrade Union leaders on the war situation, the new Prime Minister said : &quot; Weshall not suffer dictation from within, but we must have the maximum strengthwithin to prevent dictation from without. Only by standing together can we win the victory.&quot;Mr. Curtin has now formed his Cabinet, which includes, besides himself,Messrs. Forde (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the Army), Chifley(Treasurer), Evatt (Attorney-General and Minister of External Affairs),Beasley (Supply and Development), Makin (Navy and Munitions) and Drakeford(Air and Civil Aviation).  There will be no Economic Cabinet.Mr. Menzies has accepted Mr. Fadden&apos;s invitation to join the Advisory WarCouncil. The other Opposition members are. expected to be Mr. Fadden,Mr. Hughes, Mr. McEwen and Mr. Spender.The secret fund question to which reference was made in last month&apos;s report has not been dropped, and the Commission dealing with it has suggested thatMessrs. Fadden and Hughes should be represented by Counsel.There has been a wide-spread demand for greater sacrifices by civilians,one newspaper remarking that, &quot; if responsibility is left to the individual,Mr. Curtin will still appeal to the public twelve months hence.&quot; The UnitedKingdom High Commissioner reports that, meanwhile, the general attitude ofthe people shows little change, and public spending on non-essentials is still proceeding on a considerable scale.The Commonwealth loan of  100 million was more than half subscribed inthe first week.There is growing concern over the disappointing results of the recruitment for the A.I.F.In Empire affairs the practical difficulties of establishing an effective west&quot; front &quot; in present circumstances are generally recognised, although there hasbeen no attempt to tone down the comments of the London press, includingthe Times, which expressed doubt that we are making the best use of ouropportunities. A leader in the Age emphasised the mischief caused by&quot; ill-conceived Australian criticism of the strategic policy of the BritishGovernment.&quot; Mr. Eden&apos;s resolute, &quot;no parleys with Hitler,&quot; has beenprominently reported.The absence of every critical passage from the published summary ofLord Gorfs despatches has brought a suggestion that official quarters are stillanxious to conceal the facts, and that the later campaigns in Greece and Cretehave not shown that the lessons of the campaign in France have yet been learned.The whole document, the Melbourne Herald says, &apos;&apos; suggests a startling levity in britain&apos;s approach to the war.&quot;In foreign affairs concern about the effect of the struggle in Russia hasbeen widespread, and the United States is represented as being on the brinkof war on two fronts. The decision to use the Archangel route has createdmisgivings. &quot; The position,&quot; says the Sun, &quot; cannot deteriorate much furtherwithout hostilities.&quot;[23179] B 2
In the Far East, a firm front headed by U.S.A. is strongly advocated, t.and the direct radio service and the extension of the Clipper service toSydney have been welcomed as strengthening Australian/United States relations.At the same time messages from Batavia have been quoted as reflectinguncertainty in the Netherlands East Indies about the support which theNetherlands East Indies are likely to receive if attacked by Japan. Theestablishment of the Japanese air line to Timor was regarded as a dangerousmeasure necessitating vigorous counter-measures on the part of the commonwealth government, although the Sydney Bulletin saw no particular cause for alarmin view of the comment by the Commander-in-Chief, Far East, that &quot; so long-as we.are awake I do not suppose it will do any harm.&quot;As in other Dominions general horror was expressed over the mass executionsat Nantes, and the declarations of the United Kingdom Prime Minister and president Roosevelt on this matter were widely approved.Sir Earle Page, who has been sent by the Commonwealth Government todiscuss with the United Kingdom Government matters of common concern,attended a meeting of the War Cabinet on the 30th October.(5) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Two minesweepers and one boom defence vessel were commissioned during.the month, and four minesweepers were successfully launched for the royal australian Navy and one for the Royal Indian Navy.Axis prisoners of war in Australia now total 1,045 Germans and 4,778Italians.Personnel may now be enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force at 19 yearsof age with the consent of their parents, but will not be posted overseas beforethe age of 19^.Air Marshal R. Williams has arrived in England to take up duties as air officer Commanding Overseas Headquarters, Royal Australian Air Force,London. Officers and airmen for the above Headquarters also arrived later andhave now started duty.Air Commodore W. D. Bostock, R.A.A.F., arrived in the Middle Easten route to the United Kingdom and visited Australians at Tobruk.No. 452 (Fighter) Squadron, R.A.A.F., has carried out offensive sweeps overenemy-occupied territory and 11 enemy aircraft were shot down by them duringthe month. A D.S.O., D.F.C. and D.F.M. were awarded to squadron personnel.No. 455 (Bomber) Squadron took part in raids on enemy territory. No. 456(Night-fighter) Squadron carried out routine night patrols. No. 457 (Fighter)Squadron was mainly engaged on training new pilots, but several operationalflights were made without loss to themselves. No. 458 (Bomber) Squadron becameoperational and took part in raids on Antwerp, Emden, Le Havre, Cherbourg,Brest and Dunkirk, with the loss of one aircraft. No. 10 (General Reconnaissance)Squadron (Sunderlands) has been continually engaged on convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols. On the 22nd October, a Sunderland from this squadronalighted in the open sea and rescued the survivors of a Whitley aircraft whichhad been forced down.(6) Financial Position.The new Labour Government&apos;s budget was introduced on the 30th October.The Government accepted the Fadden Governments estimates of expendituresubject only to increases in pay for the Forces and invalid, old age and service pensions. Total estimated expenditure is  325 million ( 221 million for war purposes).To bridge the gap between existing revenue and expenditure Mr. Faddenhad proposed to raise  122 million by loan and  32 million by new taxation,chiefly by a War Contribution affecting nearly all income levels. The new budgetdrops Mr. Fadden&apos;s War Contribution, proposes to raise  137 million by loanand  22 million by additionaKtaxation, chiefly additional income tax on largeincomes and companies.
(7) General Position.The question which has most exercised the New Zealand Cabinet, apart frommatters relating to the war, during the month has been the provision of a freemedical service, to which the present Government are pledged. The government proposals under this head aroused fierce opposition from the medical profession;from the National party; and from the press and a considerable section of theNew Zealand public.Another matter of local interest has been the Government decision to defer the general election due to be held this year. The whole press commended thisdecision, although the opinion was expressed that a coalition Government shouldhave been formed, and all controversial legislation dropped.The New Zealand Rehabilitation Act, designed to protect the secondary industries of the country, was passed on the 17th October. Post-war modifica-tion of the law is envisaged, so that the market for primary produce may besecured.Although Labour generally welcomes co-operation with Russia, theCommunist party is described by them as &quot; unstable and undemocratic.&quot;The recent improvement in the volume of produce shipments has causedgeneral satisfaction among the agricultural community.In Empire affairs, there is now more understanding of the difficulties of creating a.&quot; second front&quot; in Europe. The complacency which is said to be general in the United Kingdom has been noted in the New Zealand press, butattention was drawn to the Admiralty disclaimer of General Freyberg&apos;s opinionthat invasion of this country is unlikely. Three occurrences, viz., the criticismin the House of Lord Halifax; the advocacy of the punishment of ministers responsible for the 1939 equipment position; and Miss Wilkinson&apos;s reception atthe recent Trafalgar Square meeting, have tended to decrease confidence in theUnited Kingdom Government.Commenting on messages from the United States about small Lease-Lendshipments. &quot; Press &quot; points out that the system now imposes sacrifices on great Britain which are disproportionate to the benefits received.The tension of the position in the Far East has engaged much attentionduring the month, but a general feeling has recently manifested itself that thesituation has eased, although critics are sceptical of the value of the &quot; A.B.C.D.&quot;front, which is described as a myth. The cessation of oil shipments toVladivostok was regarded as an ominous sign. &apos;&apos; Press &apos;&apos; advocates diplomatic representation of New Zealand at Washington, and refers to growing perturba1tion over signs of continued British-United States appeasement in the Far East.Less attention has been paid by the press this month to Russia, though theprogress of the struggle there is closely followed.(8) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Territorial For-ce. On the advice of General Sir Guy Williams, military adviser to the New Zealand Government, the Government has decided upon thefollowing changes in the organisation and period of training of the territorial force; these were announced by the Minister of Defence on the 19th September:(a) The establishment of permanent cadres amounting to some 5,000 men.(b) The extension of annual training period from two weeks to two months.(c) The additional 60 hours&apos; training per annum of evening and week-endtraining to remain unaltered.Innovation (b) will involve the withdrawal from industry of about 30,000men for an additional six weeks annually.These measures will not affect the Government&apos;s agreement to undertake toraise 3,500 men for an Army tank brigade and 2,000 men for Corps andL. of C. troops.(9) Financial Position.The New Zealand Finance Minister announced recently that the financialposition on the 30th September, half-way through the finance year 1941-42, wasvery satisfactory. By a further repayment in October of some  2^ million NewZealand have repaid all the war advances borrowed from the United Kingdomoutstanding at the end of September.
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.(10) General Position.The Government has won the King Williamstown seat in Parliament by ahunexpectedly large majority, and the result is construed as a shock to the nationalists. A large minority of the electors in the constituency were of Germandescent, and it was expected that these would vote against the Government. Theresults, however, show that at least one-half of these voters supported theGovernments war policy.General Hertzog has emerged from political obscurity with an outrightdeclaration in favour of National Socialism, which, he said, &quot; conforms closely with the spiritual and religious outlook of the Afrikaner people and was the corner-stone of the old Free State Republic.&quot; There was no need to argue abouta dictatorship, he said, as, whatever happened, this form of government was inevitable.Mr. Havenga, the Afrikaner party leader, at once repudiated his formerchiefs attitude in a vigorous speech, although he deplored the entry of theUnion into the war, an act which, he said, had &apos;&apos; had the disastrous effect oflinking the country&apos;s future with the result of hostilities.&quot; Far fromsupporting General Hertzog, the Committee of the Afrikaner party declared thatthey would still uphold democratic methods and maintain their other claims ofnationalism and racial equality. Mr. Havenga&apos;s strong hand has not onlydefeated Mr. Pirow&apos;s hope of bringing the majority of the Afrikaner party tohis side, but has put Mr. Havenga again in the forefront of politics, and mayhave prepared a way for him to join the Government party after the war. Itis thought that the Hertzog declaration may mean the virtual destruction of theAfrikaner party.Meanwhile, on the Government side, General Smuts&apos;s speech on social reformshas been well received.The Labour paper Forward strongly criticises the failure of the SouthAfrican branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association to include a Labourrepresentative in the delegation that visited England. The Labour party has issued a Declaration of Principle, championing socialism as the &quot; scientificapproach &quot; to South African problems. Comment on this by Government papersis to the effect that a &quot; real &quot; native policy is what the Labour party needs; thiswould put an end to the hypocrisy of classifying workers as &quot; skilled &quot; and&quot; unskilled,&quot; which really means &quot; white &quot; -and &quot; not white.&quot;In Empire matters, attention has been drawn in the press to the dangers ofovermuch credit being given to the achievements of Dominion troops, thus playinginto the hands of Nazi propagandists. It is realised that a new front in europe is out of the question at this stage, although the gravity of the Russian situation has been fully noted in the press.At a United Party Congress at Bloemfontein the Prime Minister expresseddisapproval of a motion to make &quot; tentative proposals to the northern States of africa to form a Federation of South African States,&quot; and the motion wasconsequently withdrawn. The Natal Mercury views on this subject are thatfederation in Africa, even including the Belgian Congo, should be possible afterthe war, and it urges investigation now of the prospects of closer co-operationbetween the various areas. Relations with the Belgian Congo, it added, have become closer; the Governor-General of the Belgian Congo has visited the Union,and the Union has opened a consulate-general at Leopoldville. At this congress the Prime Minister made a notable speech warning his hearers that a Nazi victorywould engulf the world. He ended by saying : &apos;&apos; We are doing our best to live upto the high standard of the Atlantic Charter. We need not look to dictatorshipor the &apos; New Order &apos; of the Nazi pattern to solve our troubles. Democracy can do much better towards creating ordered progress and social security.&quot;Comment on the neutrality of Eire continues to appear in the pro-Govern-ment press.Some impatience has been shown at the continued failure of the UnitedStates actively to enter the war, and-interest in the Presidential speeches waned.The Natal Mercury even stated that &apos;&apos; Britain would win the war in spite of, not because of,&quot; America&apos;s help.
Reference was made to the absence of any official indication of British-United States action if Japan were to attack Russia, and the possibility that this may give the Japanese the idea that, if they do not turn south, we shall not moveagainst them.(11) Naval, Military and Air Activities.The officers and men of the small ships of the Seaward Defence Force, now engaged in mine-sweeping, convoy work and anti-submarine patrols in theMediterranean, have been commended in a special signal by the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean. The following decorations have been awarded: SixD.S.Cs., ten D.S.Ms. and five mentioned in despatches.Three anti-submarine vessels from Cape Town and two from Durban partici-pated in an operation with the Royal Navy between the 18th and the 26th August.The object was the interception of a French convoy reported on a westerly courseround the Cape. The Cape Town flotilla sighted a small convoy, escorted by a french sloop, on an easterly course, but lost contact during the night.Liaison Officer, U.D.F., Middle East, Major-General F. H. Theron, has beenappointed General Officer Administration, U.D.F., Middle East Forces.Lieutenant-Colonel A. G. Salisbury-Jones, Coldstream Guards, has beenappointed to command the United Kingdom Mission in South Africa, with the acting rank of Brigadier, as successor to Brigadier H. G. Eady, who was killed in an aeroplane accident.Armoured cars.   The 5th Armoured Regiment has left for the Middle East.South African Women&apos;s Auxiliary Air Force is now being trained in varioustechnical trades in addition to photography, wireless operating, parachute pack-ing, clerical duties, &amp;c. They will ultimately be trained for aircraft, armament,electrical and wireless maintenance work.No. 261 Medium Bomber Wing, Middle East, has now been renumbered as no. 3 South African Wing.Corrigendum. W.P. (R) 41 58, September 1941, page 7, paragraph (10),Naval, Military and Air Activities.  Delete first sentence &quot;and substitute :  &quot; The strength of Union forces is now 11,343 officers and 148,856 other ranks, of whom 895 officers and 34,419 other ranks are on part-time service.Additional non-European services amount to 52,757.&quot;NEWFOUNDLAND.(12) General Position.Disputes between the longshoremen at St. John&apos;s and the employers have ledto some delays in dealing with shipping at the port, and representations were received from the United States Government that their construction work in newfoundland was being hampered and the movement of defence supplies toother United States bases delayed. The Newfoundland Government are appoint-ing a Mediation Board, whose findings will be made binding on both sides, andthe men have now resumed their customary hours of work, including overtime.(13) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Further small batches of recruits for the Royal Navy and the NewfoundlandRoyal Artillery units left Newfoundland during the month.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.(14) General Position.The Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia has been invited to visit theUnited Kingdom in order to see something of the war effort and of war conditionsin this country, and to discuss general questions of war co-operation. He has accepted the invitation and expects to arrive early in January. It was mentioned to Sir Godfrey Huggins that the visit would afford an opportunity for personaldiscussion of issues arising out of Lord Hailey&apos;s report on the bearing of native policy on the question of amalgamation of Southern Rhodesia, Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland.
EIRE.(15) General Position,There is little to report in the political field in Eire. In a speech early inOctober Mr. de Valera commented, &quot; Small nations in the path of great powers are generally treated with scant consideration. So far our rights have been inthe main respected, and I think it only fair in this connection to acknowledgethat the belligerent nearest to us, Great Britain, despite the temptations and theurgings of certain propagandists, has not succumbed to them, and has not behavedunworthily.&quot; In a speech on the 2nd November Mr. de Valera warned Eireagainst being lulled by a feeling of security. . &quot; This Island remains, and willremain to the end of the war, in the very heart of the battle zone with danger of attack ever present.&quot; He therefore appealed for military preparedness and national unity.Cardinal MacRory, Roman Catholic Primate of all Ireland, who is notoriousfor his unfriendly attitude to this country, in a speech about the middle ofOctober, advocated making an effort to negotiate a peace. He said that even nowthere was still an incomparably better chance of a just peace than if the war werefought until it ended in a victory for one side or stalemate. There was no chanceof a just peace when one side was victorious and the other so beaten that it wouldbe woe to the vanquished. On the 12th November Mr. de Valera said in reply toa question in the Dail arising out of the Cardinal&apos;s speech, that he would beprepared to act as intermediary in peace negotiations if circumstances madeintervention possible.During the last week of October the Eire Government issued a statement onthe subject of emigration. This statement was intended to reassure the public by creating the impression that the Eire Government was controlling, but notprohibiting emigration. It has had the effect, desirable from our point of view as well as that of the Eire Government, of damping down the agitation againstemigration which had a political inspiration.There is no change to report as regards the supply position in Eire. Asregards supplies from Eire to this country, the lifting of the ban on the import of Irish cattle into this country was mentioned in last month&apos;s summary. Cattleare now arriving at United Kingdom ports.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.(16) Political Situation.1. Although the civil disobedience campaign continues to flag, Mr. Gandhiissued a lengthy apologia at the end of the month in which he reaffirmed hisfaith in non-violence and the policy of civil disobedience, which he said must continue to be conducted not as a mass movement nor so as to embarrass theauthorities, but as an assertion by selected followers of the right to speak againstparticipation in war. It might be that the numbers offering civil disobediencewere falling off, but &quot; it does not matter if the number is reduced to ten or two;the two will represent the whole of Congress.&quot; Meanwhile, the numbers of thoseimprisoned in connexion with the campaign is steadily and rapidly falling assentences expire.2. Communal disturbances, with resulting loss of life, occurred during themonth in three or four areas, but were not unduly serious or prolonged.Mr. Gandhi, in the above-mentioned statement, emphasised the importance ofcommunal unity.3. The newly established National Defence Council met for the first timeearly in October and had a successful session. The Governor-GeneraVs expandedExecutive Council is also said to have made a good start. The Central LegislativeAssembly, which met late in the month, has been deprived of the presence notonly of the Congress members, but also of the adherents of the Moslem League
who followed Mr, Jinnah in walking out in protest against the recentadministrative changes. In the Provinces the movement towards the resumptionof ministerial government has gathered force in Orissa and definite proposals have been laid before the Governor.4. War morale is generally good, though the situation in Russia causesanxiety and the Moslem League has passed an objectionable resolution regardingAnglo-Soviet intervention in Persia.(17) Indian States.Nothing of importance to report.(18) Military Activities.1. The despatch of an additional brigade group as reinforcement to Burmahas been approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government, The move of this brigade group from India to Burma will commence about the 25th November.2. It has been decided, with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government,that the Commander-in-Chief, India, should assume responsibility for the defenceof Ceylon, and a Commander (Major-General) and Staff are being provided by india for this purpose.(19) Foreign and Frontier Relations.1. U.S.A. The Government of India, with the approval of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the concurrence of the United States Government, have recentlycreated a post of Agent-General for India in the United States. The Agent-General (who will have the status of Minister) and his staff will be attachedto His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Washington. The Government of India have appointed to this post Sir G. S. Bajpai, K.B.E., OLE., lately member of theGovernor-General&apos;s Executive Council, who is now on his way to Washington.For their part, and in view of the increasing importance of India in the field of war supplies, the United States Government have created a post of Commis-sioner for the United States in India. The Commissioner will be stationed atthe headquarters of the Government of India, though there is no question of hisperforming diplomatic functions. Mr. T. M. Wilson, lately United States Consul-General at Calcutta, has been appointed to this post and has now assumed charge.2. Afghanistan. Sir Francis Wylie conveyed the request from HisMajesty&apos;s Government for the expulsion of non-official Axis nationals fromAfghanistan to the Prime Minister on the 9th October, and a parallel request wasmade on the following day by the Russian Ambassador on behalf of his Govern-ment. On the 13th October the Prime Minister invited Sir Francis Wylie to afurther interview when, after asking whether His Majesty&apos;s Government were likely to have further demands to make and who would pay the cost of repatria-tion, he said that he could undertake to have all non-official Axis nationals outof the country in three months or even in half that time if allowed to do it in hisown way. Sir Francis Wylie was authorised to give an assurance that HisMajesty&apos;s Government had no intention of seeking to institute supply routes for russia through Afghanistan without Afghan co-operation and- also to undertakethat His Majesty&apos;s Government would bear the cost of repatriation provided the axis colonies were expelled within a month. As a result the Prime minister agreed to meet our wishes and to see that the Axis colonies Avere expelled as soonas possible, and they duly proceeded to India in two batches on the 29th and30th October. Arrangements were made for them to leave Peshawar on the7th November for Karachi, when they will be sent back to Axis-controlled terri-tory via Iraq and Turkey.A danger that remains is the possibility of an internal revolt against the ruling House in Afghanistan as a result of their compliance with our wishes.There are strong pro-German elements in the country who have been sedulouslyfostered by the Germans and Italians, and there is a possibility of trouble whenthe matter is discussed by the Loe Jirga (the grand assembly of notables and tribalchieftains), which has been specially summoned by the Afghan Government to hear a declaration of policy. It was fortunate, therefore., that the Axis nationals.[23179] c
had already left the country before this discussion opened on the 6th November.An official report on the proceedings is awaited. In order to strengthen the hand of the Prime Minister against the possibility of internal trouble, Sir FrancisWylie has been authorised to make an offer to him privately of a gift of  500,000spread over two years as some assistance towards meeting his internal difficulties.Unfortunately, however, His Majesty&apos;s Minister has not yet been able to obtain a private interview with the Prime Minister, which is a delicate matter to arrangeat present.The newly-arrived Japanese Minister, Mr. Kobayashi, died suddenly on the8th October before be had even presented his credentials to the AfghanGovernment.3. North-West Frontier. The Frontier has remained generally quiet,though there have been a certain number of incidents in Waziristan. The Faqirof Ipi remained in seclusion at Gorwekht, though there have been many rumours of his intentions after Id. In a letter to Mullahs in South Waziristan the Faqir,while continuing to vilify the British, stated that no help should be given to theGermans as they were opposed to Islam. There has been an outbreak of cholerain the Tochi Valley, causing 200 deaths, and a similar outbreak in Dir and Swat.The Tochi outbreak has now subsided. So far little interest has been evinced onthe Frontier in the passage of the Axis nationals from Afghanistan throughIndia.4. Sinkiang. In spite of the recent realignment in the international situation there have been no signs of a change in the attitude of hostility of theSinkiang Authorities, who continue their policy of persecution and arbitraryexpulsion of British subjects and confiscation of their property. Renewed efforts are now being made, both through Russian influences and through the ChineseCentral Government, to obtain permission for Mr. Shipton, the Consul-General,to visit Urumchi to discuss matters there with the Tupan.(20) Economic.Nothing to report.(21) Finance.Provincial Budgets. Owing to postal delays, the particulars of theProvincial Budgets have not previously been completely available. The following is a summary of their salient features : .1. Ministerial Provinces.Bengal.
