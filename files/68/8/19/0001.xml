(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC HAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)No.SECRET.W.P.    (R)    (4&amp;)WAR CABINET.Economic Warfare,,I attach, for the information of my colleagues, a briefreport for the month of February, 1941o14th March, 1941.

Economic   Warfare during February 1941.1.   Pregress in February has been unspectacular&apos;.   But various-sioaH-developments have combined to make the indirect blockades-more- -effective andto prepare the way for a move forward after the passing of the Lease-and-Lend Bill.2.    Ship Warrants.Among the companies which have joined the Ships Warrant Scheme are&apos;Campsa*, which controls the principal Spanish tankers and the ContinentalGrain Company. Unofficial negotiations are still continuing with Japaneseowners and meanwhile Japanese ships are steadily being exposed to the samepressure as other non-Warrant holders. Our Dutch allies have recently re-inforced the scheme by restricting the supply of bunkers to Japanese ships.3.   Export Licensing.The United States have added oil and oil-drilling machinery, radium,beryllium and sole leather to their Export Licensing List.   The directivesgoverning the issue of United States licences are more satisfactory than had been supposed but there are still many loopholes which enable the res-restrictions imposed to be evaded.    In the middle of February the Administration,in order to counter our request for interception in the Caribbean, asked anumber of South American Governments to institute export licensing on theUnited States model and to use the system in the interests of our blockade.The plan has been accepted in principle; it remains to be seen how it willwork.   It is known that the Germans will shortly impose a severe test uponthe Brazilian scheme.   They attach special importance to receiving via Japana shipment of 3,000 tons of rubber for which an Export Licence should be refused.   We have done our utmost to strengthen Lord Halifax&apos;s hand in securing American cooperation by refraining from*exercising our right ofcontrol in the Caribbean.   At the same time, the export licensing system in the Empire has been further coordinated and tightened up and certainmisunderstandings in Canada have been removed.I+.   Nearer Europe there is some progress to report but our blockadeactivities remain limited by the many other demands on-sour Naval forces andour negotiations are hampered by the lack of confidence felt by neutral countries in our strength.   Dr. Salazar has given a personal undertakingcovering the re-export from Portugal of foreign products but has refusedto include Portuguese colonial produce and has ruled that materials alreadystored in Portugal are not covered by his guarantee.   Negotiations with spain continue to be very difficult and we have been asked, but have refused,to connive at a series of deliberate breaches in our Agreements so that the spaniards can pretend to assist the Germans.i 5.   French shipping activity is still devoted mainly to Colonialtraffic.   28 vessels of 127,497 tons gross passed out and 35 vessels of162,273 tons gross passed into the Mediterranean during February.   Shipsclearing Dakar and ports in French West Africa alone, where the newseason&quot;s groundnut crop is now coming forward for shipment, totalled no less than 152,357 tons gross.   Sailings of French vessels to and fromoccupied territory are increasing, seven proceeding to Spanish and PortugueseAtlantic ports during the month.   The s.s. &quot;Jamaique&quot; arrived at Casablancafrom Bordeaux with a mixed crew of French and Germans.   Outside the colonialtraffic, the routes to Indo-China and North America via the Antilles continuedto be exploited, in spite of periodical interceptions, but there have been nofurther sailings on the South America run since the interception of thes.s.&quot;Mendoza&quot;.6,   The U.S.S.R, has demonstrated that same capacity to withdraw whenchallenged which they showed a year ago.   Their purchases of United States cottonappear to have stopped after the disclosure in London of their intention tosupply Germany and, in the cases of s,s,  &apos;Corinthiakos1 and s,s, 1 Crown City&apos; ,the Soviet Ambassador has given guarantees that the commodities which these ships contain will not reach Germany nor will they replace similar articlesexported to Germany.   In giving these guarantees, M.Maisky explained that &quot;suchcommodities are not being exported by the U.S.S.R.&apos;Information/
Information received during February has revealed a Japanese intentionto supply Germany with several important commodities, particularly rubber and tin.   Detailed arrangements are to be completed during the coming montIn view of this, arrangements are being made on our side to impose stricterrestrictions on the export of rubber and tin to Japan from Malaya and theN.E.I.
