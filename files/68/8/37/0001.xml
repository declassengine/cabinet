ECONOMIC WARFARE DURING APRIL 1941*The chief developments in the Economic War during april were negotiations in Washington about French North Africa,repercussions   of    German expansion in the Balkans and amarked acceleration in the tempo of American co-operation.FRANCE AND FRENCH NORTH AFRICA.The U.S. Administration, who were becoming more andmore conscious of the danger of increased German pressure in french North Africa, desired to meet, this &quot;by relaxing the &quot;blockade and sending in supplies accompanied by observers.The latter were intended not only to supervise the executionof guarantees against re-export, but also to obtain intelligence and to rally anti-German elements.It Beamed doubtful, however, whether support which went no further than this was worth giving,1 while a strongrumour that the French supplied the Axis forces in Libya withoil products increased our reluctance to fall in with theAmerican proposals.   There was also some difference of opinionon the question of shipping.    In their anxiety to get theobservers across, the Americans favoured the use of French ships now in America, while we were most unwilling to see such shipspass into the zone of possible enemy control.At the end of the month a*rationing agreement had still not been completed, but most of the quotas for the first quarter had been fixed and agreement reached on certain ship-ments to be made in advance, including a shipment of oil.    Onthe insistence of the State Department we agreed reluctantly thata modern French tanker, the SCHEHERESADE, ehouIcL. take oil products to French Morocco, on condition that the cargo should not be released until the. reports about supplying oil to the enemy had been proved false.In pursuance of their policy of support to marshal petain, the Americans   ha^L also informed the French that theywere willing to allow the despatch to metropolitan France oftwo more wheat ships in the near future.    They also wished to givesupport to French West Africa.     We urged, strongly theimportance of helping, at least as much, the Free french colonies.Since the end of the period under review, however,events have occurred which completely overshadow these negotia-tions and plans.     A sharp change in the U.S. policy to Vichyand the Vichy Colonies now appears certain.French sailings through the Straits of Gibraltar rosesubstantially during the month.    Sailings eastwards numbered U9and totalled 183?543 tons;    sailings westwards numbered Uk andtotalled 159,705 tons, as against hi (lko,625 tons) and 35(141,853 tons) In the previous month,THE NEAR -TCA-fyp.The German occupation of Yugoslavia and Greece andthe troubles in Iraq, have had repercussions in Turkey,    Thenegotiations referred to in the last Monthly Summary have notbeen completed.       Pre-emption is, however, continuing ona limited scale.    The problem of removing quantities of goodsalready/
already bought and stored in Turkey has not yet been solved owingto shortage of shipping.    Every effort is being made to secureTurkish shipping for this purpose, but there is strong competitioifrom the Germans.THE FAR EAST.Relations with Indo-China have deteriorated owing to thedespatch from Indo-China of a French naval tanker bound forMadagascar with a full cargo of oil.      This replenishment ofthe bunkering stocks of Madagascar is most unwelcome, and thequestion of denouncing the Decoux Agreement is under consideration the six months&apos; contract between Japan and N.E.I. for thesupply to Japan of oil products has been renewed for a further sixmonths on the same terms as before.Proposals for inter-allied control of copra, initiated bythe Netherlands Government and H.M. Ambassador at Washington, aremaking progress and a common policy for controlling the exportof this commodity from allied sources to Japan is underconsideration.CO-OPERATION WITH THE U.S.A.The U.S. Administration have made important additions tothe list of commodities subject to export licence;    conversations on collaboration in economic warfare have been proceeding in washington during the month;    and Colonel Clabaugh, a member ofthe staff of the U.S. Export Control Administrator, has beenappointed to act as liaison with M.E.Wo in London.    Moreover theAdministration contemplate^ &quot;preclusive&quot; purchases of strategic materials and export surpluses in South America,and have nowadopted a policy of marked restriction towards Russia.On the other hand Mr,  Sumner Welles maintains his objection tointerception in the Carribean, and the introduction of effectiveexport licensing in South American countries is not likely to makemuch progress,  until U.S, purchases have materialised. Therehas also been no visible advance towards the blocking of enemybalances,  though Greek and Yugoslavian balances were blocked inthe   course of the month when these countries became &apos;enemy-occupied&apos;.THE BALTIC AMD SCANDINAVIA.The extension of Germany&apos;s so-called blockade area to coverIceland,  the Faroes and their adjacent waters has interruptedTrans-Atlantic sailings to and from Gothenburg.German infiltration into Finland has been carefully watchedbut has not, as yet, been regarded as a reason for reducing orsuspending Finnish quotas.ECONOMIC WEAPONS.The development of those economic weapons on which it ishoped increasingly to rely in enforcing the blockade has proceededsteadily.    A further 129 vessels came under the Ships&apos; WarrantScheme during the month.   And although U.S. co-operation in ship-ping and particularly bunker control has not yet been secured, theassistance of the U.S. Maritime Commission has much restrictedthe freedom of unfriendly shipping in American waters,    Moreove*-the Ministry of Shipping have taken steps to prevent british ships carrying,from South to North America,  cargoes which aredestined for trans-shipment to Russia.
