1, Enteric Fever comprises typhoid, paratyphoid A and paratyphoid B.2, Measles and Wnooping Cough are not generally compulsorily  .notifiable in Scotland.     The figures shown are mainly obtained by Medical Officers of Health by voluntary arrangement with private practitioners.3, Pneumonia includes the acute influenzal and acute primary forms,which are notifiable and also other forms not notifiable.4. Poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis) includes polioencephalitis.Comments on Figures.Diphtheria.   There has been for some months a high incidence in glasgow and Dundee.   This shows at present some tendency to fall.Both cities initiated special immunisation measures recently but asimmunity does not develop until two or three months after inoculationthe effect of these immunisation campaigns will oot be appreciablefor some time.Measles.   An epidemic w&amp;s expected in 1940 fcwt. did not occur.     the incidence has been moderately high lately;   not sufficiently so to saythat the epidemic has arrived.cerebro-spinal-spinal Fever.     The 1940 epidemic was the largest sincerecords have been kept of this disease (about 35 years).     The incidenceremained abnormally high after the epidemic, and the 1941 figurespresage another period of epidemicity.     The fatality rate has been much reduced by drug treatment, but is still from 15^, to 20^ of all cases.The attention of local authorities and medical officers of health was drawn in a memorandum issued by the Department of Health for scotland in March 1940 to the increased incidence of this disease and to measuresto be taken for checking its spread.     Similar action is being taken now.
