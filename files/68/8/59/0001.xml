The same rate will apply to the if lb. loaf in,Scotland and slightly&quot;higher prices will obtain in Northern Ireland.Distribution of oatmeal in August, at 2.4 thousand tons a week was a little larger than in July, but supplies were insufficient to meet demands and stocks were reduced to a low level.     In September an increase :in,distribution to 3.0thousand tons a week is expected.Total stocks rose from- 56&apos; thousand tons to 47 thousand tons during August as a result of heavy arrivals, and a further   : ;iincrease to 66 thousand tons is expected in September.&apos;     Theproportion of broken rice in the total stocks, at present50$, is to be reduced.Arrivals, are forecast :to,exceed consumption in September/November and in addition about half the new home crop should&apos;become available.     A considerable expansion in total stocks -is therefore expected, from 708 thousand tons at end-august to 1,076 thousand tons at end-November.(i)   Except in a few.areas the shortage of supplies due to ijhelate season cameHo an end in the latter part of AuguJSI(ii) It is expected that consumption will be stimulated by thelow retail price which will be kept, by subsidies, at: id. per lb.

Liquid milk sales increased from 81 to 92 million gallons in the same period, i. e. by14$.(ii) Registration&apos; is being completed and/arrangements are beingmade to ensure- that supplies--ar-e-available for priorityconsumers and that distribution to non-priority consumersis equalised as&apos; far as practicable.Condensed      (i) The Services at -home are ceasing to use liquid milk.

LEM)/LEASESUPPLIES(i) About 40$ of the estimated total cereal feed requirements. and 60$ of the estimated total protein feed requirements duringthe first three months of the winter rationing period(Octobor-December) are for dairy cows.(ii) Protein requirements in October/December should be adequatelycovered by the home production of oilcake in the period andaccumulated reserves.     About a quarter of the cerealrequirements is expected to be met from imported maize. sArrivals of Lend/Lease commodities in August amounted to 160 thousand tons, as compared with 87 thousand tons in July and 33 thousand tons inJune.     Loadings in August, 148 thousand tons, were no greater than inJuly and fell short of programme.

Increased use Isbeing made of the canals.(ii) Some difficulties are still being experienced in findingadequate warehouse space. Buffer and sub-buffer depotswere practically full at the end of August.(iii) Gold storage space should be adequate to meet.the autumnf        peak if there is no further serious air raid damage tothe col&quot;d stores.Retail        The Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of retail food prices (Julyprices;       1914=100) stood at 166 on 1st September, one point lower thana month earlier and 20 per cent above its level on 1stSeptember, 1939.     The decline was due to a seasonal fall inpotato prices.Rationing;      (i) A points system of rationing canned meals will probablycome into operation during November.(ii) Pood Control Committees withdrew supplies of rationedfood from 9,806 retailers who were unable to obtain atleast 25 registered customers but continued supplies in 5,656 cases, mainly on the ground of hardship to theretailer.Britishrestaurants:At end-August there were 989 British Restaurants and othermeal centres in operation, serving 242,500 meals daily.Pit-head canteen facilities were available at 228collieries and plans are in progress to provide similar facilities at a further 398 collieries;   together these will cover 75($ of colliery workers.Ministry of Pood, 1,7.1.^      2nd October, 1941.VA
