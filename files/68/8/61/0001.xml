September, 1941(Previous Report W.P.(R)(41)50.)Efforts to speed up the return of ex-Miners to;the pitscontinued throughout September and by the end of the month the Ministry of Labour and National Service returns showed that only 21,843 men had been &quot;placed&quot; under the registration Scheme.     A special census of the collieriesshowed that up to that date 20,500 had actually been enteredon colliery books, but of these 2,030 had already gone again,710 having been discharged by the collieries on variousgrounds of unsuitabil ..ty and the remainder having left oftheir own accord.     Against this gain of 18,200 has to beset a net loss on other grounds - i .e, natural wastage lessordinary recruitment - of about 3,000 In the 15 weeks,making tile net Increase only 15,200,     The total labour forceof 706,000 on the 27th September was still 14,000 short ofthe minimum figure of 720,000 already approved by theWar Cabinet,     The measures necessary to secure this further increase are under consideration by the Lord President&apos;sCommittee.Now that holidays are over the weekly rate of productionper man has recovered the level in March and May last,      Inthe last week of the month the average number of days&apos; on whichthe pits wound coal reached the record figure of 5.75 for thewar period set up in June last.      This is In striking contrast with the situation a year ago when,mainly owing to enemyinterference with transport, the average number of days,worked was only 5.20,     Total production during September,1941SECRET.

was practically the same as a year ago when the average man-power was some 40,COO -greater.Thanks to the relative freedom from inland air attackdeliveries to London and the South were well maintained duringthe month and the total stocks distributed throughout thecountry are above - their level of a year ago and they are moreevenly distributed.    Foreign shipments were at the lowest levelof any month since the war started.The provision of catnteens at the pits is being pressed .forward by-the Miners&apos; Welfare Commission. .   Of the 1,100 pitsemploying 50 men or more (covering 95 per cent, of tho industry)400 have now canteens of one type or another and nearly 400more have schemes in various stages of progress.      Only 50of the 800 are, however, designed to supply sit-down meals.D.R.G.   &apos;Mines Department &apos;20th October,  1941.
