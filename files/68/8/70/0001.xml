RawCocoa:Starch:Tea :       The shipping programme has been modified so that the normal.-JS. seasonal loading will be spread more evenly over the year.Nevertheless in November-January a considerable expansion of stocks is expected.Arrivals were low in October and forecast arrivals for november and December show little improvement.    The decline in stocksis expected to come to an end after December.Allocations for food uses during October-December have been increased by approximately 19 per cent as compared withJuly-September.    Those for industrial uses have been reducedby about 4 per cent.-   Total stocks are forecast to show slightincreases.(i)    Up to the end-October ,&quot;17 thousand tens of Lend/Lease maize hadbeen loaded.    It is expected that a further 97 thousand tons willbe loaded in November.(ii)   Maize stocks are expected to increase from 66 thousand tons at end October to 180 thousand tons at the end of the year.Consumption will fall sharply after November because very littlemaize will be issued for feeding purposes.(iii) Up to end-October 190 thousand, tons of oats had been received fromfarms or promised under the scheme for granting cereal and proteinfeedingstuffs in return for grain sold. The time-limit for making these arrangements has been extended.VI.    DISTRIBUTION.Cold Storage:   Cold storage capacity at end-October was 38.8 million cubic feet.    This is an increase of 2.8 million over U.K.capacity at the outbreak of war in spite of the fact that.6 million cubic feet of space is still out of commission as the result of enemy air attack.Retail pricegRationing:The Ministry of Labour,.&apos;s index of retail food prices(July,1940 slOO) at 1st November remained unchanged atIb5.    Increases in the prices of flour and milk werecounterbalanced by reductions in the prices of bread and potatoes.(i)    The opening date of the points rationing scheme was postponed from 17th November to 1st December becauseof difficulties in the distribution of initial stocks to retailers.(ii) Queues continue to diminish in number and size and now appear to be limited to customers for fish andfor sweets and chocolate.War-timemeals &amp;catering i(i)    The number of British restaurants and other MealsCentres increased during October from 1048 to II48and the number of meals served daily from 258,000 to285,000,..(ii)   Catering establishments serving industrial workers are now being classified as (a), those serving heavyworkers in certain industries and (b) those servingother industrial workers.    This step is a preliminary-to the. provision of increased allowances of meat andother rationed feeds to such canto-ens.&apos;Ministry of Pood, W.i.29th November 1941.
