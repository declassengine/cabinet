(r) (41)29)The large and continuing loss of men from the mining industry to other employment has led to the general acceptance both by owners and men of thenecessity of applying to it the Essential work Order and negotiations have &quot;been,proceeding throughout the month on the terms of its application.   Agreement wasreadied by both sides on the incorporation in the Order of a guaranteed fullworking week on conditions appropriate to the grade and the district, thoughdefinite approval of the draft Order by the Mineworkers1 Federation was delayedby their unexpected submission of other proposals unacceptable to the owners.It has now been decided that the cost of the guaranteed week shotild be met from a central fund created by an amendment of the Central Scheme under the&apos;Coal Mines Act, 1930f to be financed by a uniform levy per ton over the totalsales of the industry.   This levy would be at such rate as is estimated to spread the cost evenly over the year.   It is not anticipated that any generalraising of pithead coal prices will be necessary for this purpose, but increases of various amounts will be necessary in certain districts If full production is to be maintained.   The amounts required4 are at present under consideration.Tine lost for the Easter holidays, has led to a loss of output for thetwo weeks concerned.   In the other two weeks production has been above theaverage for preceding months, though still much bolow the level estimated to be required.Transport of coal coastwise has been maintained at about the average ofrecent weeks, while the former widespread shortage in the supply of emptywagons to collieries has completely disappeared.   Except as regards coaltraffic out of South Wales - and here an immediate and substantial improvement is to be expected from the recent decision to curtail passenger facilities -available railway transport is now in excess of coal supplies.During the month an.important step has been taken in the direction ofsimplification of house coal distribution by the grouping of the many varietiesof household fuel into three classes of coal and three of other fuel and givingthe colliery or merchant liberty to supply any grade of coal falling withinthe class to which the ox&apos;der of the merchant or consumer relates.   The more radical step of a complete pooling of grades in each class was found topresent difficulties out of all proportion to any additional advantage thatits adoption would have afforded.The usual tables in regard to stocks are appended.   The total amountremaining in stock at the beginning of the month was slightly above thatestimated in the statistical stocking programme appended to my report for february, but the figures for gas and electricity undertakings were somewhatlower.   The cold weather throughout most of the month has kept up theconsumption of both gas and electricity, and, contrary to the position a yearago, both groups of - undertakings continued throughout the month to draw uponstocks, though at a declining rate.    ; , ......D.
