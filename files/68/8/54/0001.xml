FOOD STOCK The large increase in the index forecast for end-October, as comparedINDICES    with the index at end-July, is mainly attributable to the inclusion inOctober of estimates for the new home crops of wheat and potatoes.INDICES OF PRINCIPAL FOOD STOCKS.

OOIvfi/PDITY SUPPLY POSITION:July arrivals of wheat were at a high level;   oatmeal continues in short supply;   a substantial increase in sugar stocks, is expected;   potatoes wereENERGY FOODS(carbohydrates-hydrates)   not plentiful in July.Wheat &amp; flour:Oatmeal;Sugar:Potatoes:(i) Arrivals of wheat were heavy again in July, averaging163 thousand tons a week, as compared with the war-timerecord of 191 thousand tons a week in June and 102thousand tons a week from September 1939 to May 1941.(ii) Bulk stocks of wheat rose by 290 thousand tons in july and bulk stocks of flour by 104 thousand tons. The total increase, in terms of wheat, is equal to 3 weeks&apos; supply,(iii) Bulk stocks of wheat are expected to decline from1,816 thousand tons at end-July to 1,615 thousand tons at end-October,   Flour stocks should increase slightly inthat period.The shortage will continue until oatmeal from the new homecrop is available at the end of September or early October.Expected imports in September should make the supply positionin that month easier than in August.(i) Due to the doubling of the domestic ration and increasedallocations to jam manufacturers during July, bulk stocksfell by 23 thousand tons to 556 thousand tons at the endof the month but they are expected to rise to 767 thousanjtons at end-October, including 100 thousand tons of thehome crop.(ii) Additional allocations are being made to chocolate andconfectionery manufacturers, to bakers and flourconfectioners, and to cake and biscuit manufacturers.Supplies were short during July owing to the lateness of thenew crop.   Supplies temporarily improved in the week ended27th July when the seasonal reduction of  3 per ton in thegrowers&apos; price was suspended, but were less plentiful,in   gjlearly August,
Hard and soft oil stock positions are expected to improve in August and september;    a large expansion of lard stocks is forecast;    total butterstocks are expected to decline in August-October.Oilseeds^ (i) Total stocks of oilseeds declined during July to 179 thousandVegetable tons but they are expected to rise to 257 thousand tons atOils; end-September.(ii) The soft oil stock position deteriorated slightly in Julybut the hard oil position improved.     Both are expected toimprove in August-September.(iii) As a safeguard against an interruption of supplies of west african technical palm oil, arrangements are being made tosecure alternative supplies and substitutes.(iv) The decline in linseed stocks was checked in July.   no improvement can be expected until after the end of October.Margarine (i) ;Total stocks of margarine should be maintained during August-&amp; lard; October whilst total stocks of lard are forecast to expandfrom 25 thousand tons at end-July to 67 thousand tons at end-October.(ii) Supplies of animal lard from the U. S.A. began to arrive inJuly and are expected to average 5 thousand tons a week inAugust-Ootober.Butter:       Arrivals fell in July and the decline is likely to continue until october when a recovery is expected.     Total stocks are forecast to decline to 46 thousand tons at end-October.The expansion of the stocks of imported meat is expected to continue;it is hoped that the 4 oz. bfecon ration will be maintained;    total suppliesof eggs during August-October will be small;    cheese consumption is being increased.Meat; (i) The seasonal increase in home-killed supplies should off-set the decline in arrivals expected in September-October.Total stocks of imported meat are forecast to increase from142 thousand tons at end-July to 185 thousand tons at end-Ootober.(ii) Home-killed supplies during August-October, 1941, areexpected to be 72 thousand tons less than in the corres-ponding months of 1940.(iii) In August a quarter of the total meat arrivals is likely tcbe boneless beef suitable for the ration.     The proportionis expected to increase in subsequent months.Bacon: (i) Of the bacon arrivals in July, 45^ came from the U. S.A. butonly half of these supplies proved suitable for issue againstthe ration,(ii) Although total stocks are expected to be maintained during august-October the stocks suitahle for the ration will fall to a low level.(iii) With a small expansion of home production (which will greatlyreduce the stocks of imported frozen caroases), it is hoped to maintain the 4 oz, ration.Fish: (i) Total supplies of fresh and frozen fish were,greater in Julythan in May or June,   Average port prices in)July were about25^ lower than in June, largely as a result of the maximum price   Order.(ii) A contract has been signed for the purchase of Icelandic fishup to end-June 1942 and this is expected to produce 130thousand tons,
Eggs:VEGETABLEPROTEINPOODS.PROTECTIVEPOODS.Cheese other  .COMMODITIES(i) The full control scheme for eggs came into operation on10th July, Imparted eggs of &quot;bad quality had to be soldoutside the scheme.(ii) Total supplies during August-October are expected to be 1small.    U. S.A. shipments in non-refrigerated space havebeen cancelled.(i) The ordinary domestic ration will be increased, from 2 oz.to 3 ozs. on 25th August.    At the end of Septemberallocations will be made to ordinary catering establishmentson the same basis as the present allocations to works canteens(ii) Total stocks rose to 57 thousand tons at end-July but areexpected to fall to 49 thousand tons at end-October,The supply of pulses has been increased by the import of dried beans froijthe U,S. A.    Dried peas-   are scarce, and split peas   and lentils are in short supply.The distribution of condensed and dried milk will be increased when thecontrol scheme for liquid milk is introduced in October;    fresh fruit is notplentiful but supplies for jam making will be maintained;    arrivals of dried,fruit are more than sufficient to meet increased consumption.Liquid        (i) Provisional figures show that production in July was 119milk: million gallons as compared with 121 million gallons in July1940, a decrease of 1,7$, but that liquid milk sales increased from 78 to 93 million gallons, &amp;.e., by 19,2^.(ii) The scheme for controlling liquid milk consunption is tocome into force on 1st October.Condensed &amp;       Increased issues of condensed milk will be made when liquiddried milk;       milk consumption is controlled,   A rationing scheme may benecessary if consumption is excessive.    Increased suppliesof dried milk will also be available, including -g- lb.packages for domestic use.Fresh fruit (i) The plum and apple crops will be small.    A large proportion&amp; vegetables:    of the plum crop and small apples will be diverted to jamand fruit pulp manufacturers.(ii) Fresh vegetables were more plentiful in July than in Junebut prices were appreciably higher than last year.Jam &amp; (i) Total supplies of home-grovm soft fruit and rhubarb for jammarmalade;        manufacture this season are likely to be about 21 thousandtens more than was anticipated.(ii) The preserves ration was raised on 28th July from 8 ozs.to 16 ozs. per four weeks.Driedfruit:Tea;Cocoa;Beer;Arrivals in July-October are expected to bo sufficient to meetconsumption at a rate three times that of June and to increasebulk stocks from 41 thousand tons at end-June to 73 thousand tons at end-October,Stocks will reach a seasonal low level in August, End-Augusttotal stocks are forecast at 71 thousand as compared with thelow figure of 33 thousand tons for end-August 1940,Arrivals in July were below consumption but they are expectedto be higher in August-October.    Bulk stocks should risesteadily to 57 thousand tons at end-October despite increasedutilisation by chocolate and confectionery manufacturers frcmAugust onwards.Shortages are still occurring in many districts despite anincrease of 10 per cent, over pre-war output in terms ofbulk barrels.
St:-.m&apos;&apos;-: Arrivals will be on an increased scale in September and october and it is expected that higher consumption by industry and for the manufacture of food powders andglucose will be met without reducing stocks.(i)   During August and September, supplies of feedingstuffs are expectedto be sufficient to meet the requirements of the rationing scheme,including an advance allocation to dairy farmers.(ii)   Shipments of 100 thousand tons of maize from the U.S.A., have beenarranged for August-November as an emergency reserve.   A further150 thousand tons may be imported from the U.S.A. before the endof 1941, in place of timber.Arrivals of Lease-Lend commodities in May, June and July were 1.5333 and 87 thousand tons respectively.   The main items in the total of122 thousand tons were evaporated milk (24 thousand tons), raisins (14),bacon (14), dried beans (12), cheese (10 ) and lard (10).   Loadings inJuly were 148 thousand tons and estimated loadings in August are197 thousand tons.   Programmes for September-November totalling 862 thousand tons have been submitted and instructions have been given to shipeverjdihing that is available.   The main factors which make the long-termsupply outlook somewhat discouraging are the rise in U.S. commodity prices and the fact that the IMS.A. is not normally a large exporter ofthe foods required.V.   DISTRIBUTIONTransport &amp;        (i) Very heavy arrivals of wheat and flour in JulyWarehousing: necessitated the use of emergency storage space tofacilitate the prompt discharge of vessels.(ii) It will probably be necessary to fill up cold stores in the London district and to adopt emergency stowagemeasures to meet the increased demand for cold storage space in September and October.Retail prices; The index of retail food prices remained unchanged at 167on August 1st.Licensing of     In future wholesale traders in all price-controlledfood traders:   foods will require licences to trade.   Retailers havebeen registered since the outbreak of war.W.Ministry of Pood, W.l.3rd September, 1941.
