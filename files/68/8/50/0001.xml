Mines covering July. 1941.(previous Report:    Paper W.P.(R)(41)47)The gravity of the coal position increased during July owingto the delay in adding to the nan-power of the industry.    Afterthe failure of the &quot;broadcast appeal on the 23rd June for the voluntary return of 50,000 cx-miners to the industry, the Ministerof Labour and National Service gave directions for the compulsoryregistration on 17th and 18th July of all men under 60 years ofage with more than 6 months experience in the industry since 1st January, 1935.    Over 104,000 registered and of these 24,988indicated their willingness to return.    Up to the 7th August6,586 men, mainly face workers, had been placed and had reportedfor duty.    In the course of his recent tour of the mining distrithe President of the Board of Trade was impressed by the efficiiwith which the Divisional Officers of the Ministry of Labour, inconjunction with the District Production Committees,  are handlingthis large-scale movement of labour.In the Mines Department memorandum of the 24th June it was stated that the completion of the reduced stocking programme thereinenvisaged (for adding 16 million tons to stocks by the 51st Octoberinstead of 24 million tons as originally) was conditional onsecuring an increase of 15,000 men by the end of July.    present arrangements seem likely to produce this total before the middleof August with a promise of more thereafter but, with only 12 weeks to go before the end of October, the best that can now be looked for in stocking is to reach the same aggregate tonnage ofdistributed stocks as we had at the end of October last year and tohave this stock distributed with better relation to prospectivedemands upon it than last year.    Reference was made in last month&apos;sreport to the appointment of a special Committee to supervise thesupplies and stocking of public utility undertakings;    the recent
-2-    &apos; &apos;    &apos; &apos;rebti\ictiobw oxi household eu.ppli.os are serving a similar purpose ^of securing a hotter distribution of stocks, and attention is nowhoing paid to t]jis witter in regard to general industry.The attached tables of production, etc, shew a generaldownward tendency of output in July, due to holiday-taking, withan exceptionally heavy fall in the- fourth week when three out ofthe four Scottish coalfields were on holiday for most of the&apos;week,Provisional figures for the following week shew considerablerecovery, but a low figure may be expected for the current weekwhen holidays for the whole or part of the week are widespread inEngland and Wales;.During the period 25th July to 2nd August the President ofthe Board of Trade, cccompanird by the President of theMincworkors&apos; Federation end the Director of the Mining Associationvisited 21- of the 25 District Production Committees, 19 being metseparately.    The remaining district of Kent is to be visited inthe hear future.    Freak discussions were hold&apos;on the factorsaffecting production raid it is hoped that the results will beseen in improved weekly figures of output as the disturbing effects of holidays fade away.Canteen arrangements have been concluded or are under negotiation for two-thirds of the mineworkers of the country.The Miners&apos; &quot;welfare Commission have asked authority to use theirfunds for the provision of buildings in addition to equipment anda Defence Sogelation to give authority is being drafted.    (itis necessary to override the Mining Industry Act of 1926 and theMining Industry (Miners&apos; welfare) Act of 1934.)The Department have now put into force a scheme for dealingwith the most important of the existing disparities in the &apos;delivered prices of coal by means of a system of Exchequer grantsen seaborne coal and certain abnormal inland traffics.    the primary object of all these arrangements is to facilitate themovement of coal, especially where it has to come by abnormalroutes to relieve congestion on the normal routes.
The subsidy on seaborne coal, which has been in operationsince January, has been extended to provide for basic flat ratesof freight which will abolish the disparities in the cost of bringing coal in large ships and small ships respectively.This will encourage the use of the smaller ships, which thoughless economical are cumulatively of great transport value.In the case of domestic coal these rates have been fixed at levelcomparable with those of rail costs to the same places.    whereas the former subsidy applied only to ports south of a line fromGloucester to the Wash? the new arrangements apply to shipments to all ports in Groat Britain, including the Scottish Islands.As regards inland traffic, Exchequer assistance is to begiven towards the extra costs in which consumers are involved intahing coal under Government direction from abnormal sources ofsupply.    This will cover coal now*being sent in the Governmentconvoy trainloads from the North East Coast to industrialconsumers in Lancashire and Cheshire.    It will also cover thecase of consumers compelled by Government direction to take theircoal by inland waterway instead cf by rail.The export position has been discussed with theCoal Production Council, and with their concurrence it has beendecided that no coal which can be distributed in the country should be sent abroad except for overwhelming reasons of national policy.    In order to stimulate demand at home for the largersiaes of anthracite and the dry steam coal now going abroadit has been decided that such coal will be supplied without regard to the limits recently imposed on deliveries of coal and coke to non-industrial consumers and their stocks.8th August, 19hl.D.
