SECRET.W.P. (R)        48.July 21, 1941.Copy No.      51WAR CABINET.REPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE 1941 FOR THE DOMINIONS.INDIA, BURMA, AND THE COLONIES, PROTECTORATES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.1. General Position.THE Canadian Parliament adjourned on the 17th June until the3rd November, subject to recall if the St. Lawrence seaway project is passed bythe United States Senate more quickly than is at the moment expected.The Canadian war effort is now beginning to get into &quot;full stride&quot; andan increasing realism has been shown among all parties during the month. Thenew war loan, which has been a great success, has, in fact, evoked the commentthat men are required as well as dollars, and even French-speaking leaders seemto be modifying their opposition to conscription. L&apos;Action Catholique has urgedFrench-Canadians to enlist voluntarily, pointing out that conscription had beenjettisoned entirely out of consideration for Quebec; while Cardinal Villeneuvestated, more explicitly, on Jean Baptiste day, that &quot; we are at war by a legitimatedecision of a Government we elected voluntarily, and we are obliged to fight. Itis not enough to furnish money, we are equally obliged to furnish men.&quot; TheQuebec Premier, Mr. Godbout, has also said that his Province is &quot; ready to fightto the last sacrifice with other Provinces.&quot;There has been much criticism of the Government labour policy, which hasculminated in the setting up of a Labour Conciliation Committee to mediate in industrial strikes. The Committee has received a general welcome from thepublic, whose opinion is shown by the expressions of approval of president roosevelt&apos;s action in sending United States troops to break up an aviation strike in California. One Canadian paper urges that similar action should be taken,if necessary, in Canada.Evidence of internal disunity was, however, revived during the month by asuggestion from Mr. Hepburn, Premier of Ontario, that Mr. Mackenzie King-should call a new conference with Provincial Premiers to discuss the vexedquestion of taxation. The recent Canadian budget virtually ignored the questionof provincial taxation.  Mr. Hepburn&apos;s suggestion has had a mixed reception.Interest in the progress of the war has, however, overshadowed internal political problems, and the late Secretary to the Canadian High Commissioner inLondon has. in a speech, felt obliged to attack the complacent view, evident inthe Dominion, that a British defeat is quite impossible. Signs of the newfeeling which is being aroused are shown by the wide public indignation at the[22741] BPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1941.
Government policy of wheat sales to Japan. Suggestions have also been madefor the rationing of foodstuffs. &amp;c., and wheat and bacon producers are being encouraged to build up a larger surplus of these commodities for export to theUnited Kingdom.The Winnipeg Free Press, commenting on the delay by Washington inrepealing the Neutrality Act, said that this was &quot; all too likely to result in somedissipation of the magnificent effect of President Roosevelt&apos;s great speech.&quot;Canada is the only Dominion from which no report was received during themonth commenting on the proposal for an Imperial War Cabinet. There was general support for a speech by the United Kingdom High Commissioner at theCanadian-American Congress, in which he said that, although close ties between canada and the United States were essential, any diminution of British influence in the Dominions in favour of American influence would be an unfortunatedevelopment.Comment on events in Europe, and on the war generally, has not been particularly striking. There was admiration for the gallantry of the troops andfor the efficiency with which the withdrawal from Crete was conducted, and theBritish action in Syria was welcomed. The German attack on Russia has caused&quot; difficulties&apos;&quot; in the reorientation of public opinion. There was whole-heartedendorsement of Mr. Churchi 11 &apos;s speech, but the strong Roman Catholic influence in the Dominion has naturally enough prevented any sentimental swing towardsthe country which professes communism, though the Pope&apos;s refusal to advocateanything in the nature of an &quot; Anti-red &quot; crusade is widely applauded. A certainsympathy is shown for the Russian people, who are regarded as Stalin&apos;s dupes.The &quot;Russians.&quot; says one newspaper, &quot;are not all clods.&quot; &quot;In fighting abandit men do not stop to ask the religion or political sympathies of those whoassist them.&quot;Increasing impatience is generally felt with the Vichy attitude of co-opera-tion with the Nazis, resistance to the latter being now recognized as a &quot; beautifuldream.&quot; There have been further demands for the removal of the Vichy repre-sentatives in Canada, and the new Free French publicity office in Montreal hasbeen welcomed.2. Naval, Military and Air Activities.Practically all the Canadian destroyers have been re-transferred across the atlantic and are now based on St. John&apos;s, Newfoundland.Major Power, Minister of National Defence for Air, with the Chief of theCanadian Air Staff and the Canadian Air Member for Personnel arrived inLondon by air during June.An Air Cadet League, corresponding to the Air Training Corps in theUnited Kingdom, has been formed.Between 2,000 and 3.000 women are to be recruited for a Women&apos;s army corps.Munitions contracts awarded by the Canadian Department of Munitions and supply on Canadian and United Kingdom account now amount to $1,700 million.3. Economic Activities.Nothing to report.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.4. General Position.The principal political event during the month was Mr. Menzies&apos;&quot; greatbroadcast plea on the 17th June for the strongest possible Avar effort.Mr. Menzies&apos; remarks were not only concerned with hopes but with facts. Heannounced the creation of five new Ministries, with a separate Minister of Supply,an Assistant Minister of Aircraft Production (under the Ministry of Munitions)and a Minister to co-ordinate civil defence. A separate Director-General ofSupply, and a new Director of Tanks and A.F.V. Production have also beenappointed. These appointments increase the Cabinet to 19, with an Inner cabinet of 6.   Mr. Menzies also announced Government control of coastal shipping,
internal transport and coal production; and the prohibition of all strikes andlock-outs. He stated that the Government intended to cut the petrol ration inan attempt to reduce the present consumption of 20 million gallons a month to12 million. He also stated that newly-formed Parliamentary Committees should include one to examine war profits. Altogether, the speech received a generalwelcome, which was endorsed by Mr. Curtin, Labour Opposition Leader, despiteperfunctory Labour criticism of the labour clauses in the Government!s proposals.On the other hand, the reception of the news of the Cabinet reforms variedfrom &quot;critical&quot; to &quot;tepid,&quot; and the Prime Minister has accordingly been somewhat depressed by this. The political situation in Australia, therefore,remains delicate, and the prestige of the Government is declining. The Labourparty has unanimously rejected a plea for the formation of a coalition government. In the House of Representatives the Government is virtually ina minority of one, while the strength of the parties in the Senate is now :Government 18, Opposition 17, Independent 1. But of these, one GovernmentSenator is overseas and a Labour president, with a casting vote, has recently beenelected.While the press, with the exception of the Roman Catholic weeklies, hasshown no desire to conduct a post-mortem on the heavy Australian losses inCrete, both Government and Opposition members of the Advisory War council have demanded a revision of Empire strategy in the Middle East.As in Canada, the State power of taxation in Australia is proving asdamaging to the Commonwealth financial system as the &quot;break of gauge is tothe railway&quot; (Sydney Morning Herald). Strong industrial interests have alsoprotested against the alleged embargo on the supply of petrol by tanker toAustralia, and against the cut in newsprint.A campaign is still being carried on in the press for an Imperial WarCabinet. In this Australia has gone much further than any other Dominion. TheSydney press now suggests the despatch of an Australian Minister, as observer,to London, and there were some complaints regarding the United KingdomPrime Minister&apos;s dismissal of the subject in the House of Commons. It is saidto be common knowledge that Mr. Menzies is anxious to return to England.With the exception of the Roman Catholic press, whose attitude continues tobe unhelpful, comment on Russia coincides with the realistic view held generally in London. One paper said that Mr. Churchill&apos;s speech &quot;cuts like a swordthrough the web of lies and hypocrisy in which Hitler enveloped his act of starkand treacherous aggression against Soviet Russia.&quot; There has been unanimousapproval of the British campaign in Syria.5. Naval, Military and Air Activities.H.M.A.S. Waterhen was hit by a bomb in the Mediterranean at the end ofJune.   She was taken in tow but subsequently sank.   There were no casualties.It has been announced that 17,236 officers*and men took part in the campaignsin Greece and Crete, of whom 11,285 were evacuated to Egypt and Palestine. Inall, 261 officers and 5.690 other ranks are missing (2,275 in Greece, and 3,676 inCrete).At the end of the month A.I.F. enlistments totalled 159,275, of whom 81,878are serving overseas and 1,017 are in transit,6. Australian Surplus Produce.Following on negotiations conducted by Mr. Greenwood with Mr. Menziesand Mr. Bruce, a statement of policy in regard to Australian surplus producewas agreed with the Commonwealth Government and published as a white paper (Cmd. 6287) on the 26th June. The statement provides for the purchase by the Ministry of Food of all the Australian produce that can be shipped, forthe establishment from the balance of reserve stocks of storable foodstuffs, andfor the cost of acquiring and holding these stocks to be shared equally betweenthe Commonwealth and the United Kingdom Governments. A corresponding-statement applicable to New Zealand produce was agreed at the same time with the New Zealand Government, after negotiations between Mr. Greenwoodand Mr. Fraser.   This was published on. the same day as Cmd. 6288.[22741] b 2
NEW ZEALAND.7. General Position.Mr. Fraser, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, accompanied by Mr. C. A.Berendsen, Head of the Prime Ministers Department and Secretary of theDepartment of External Affairs, arrived in the United Kingdom on a visit onthe 20th June. Since his arrival Mr. Fraser has attended meetings of the WarCabinet, held discussions with various United Kingdom Ministers and visitednaval establishments, New Zealand personnel, &amp;c, in the South of England andSouth Wales.In connexion with the general election campaign the official Labour organ,the Standard, announced on the 19th June that &quot; there is not going to be aNational Government.&quot; The rest of the press, the greater part of which isConservative, continued to attack the Government for refusing to drop party politics or to give a lead in economic matters. There is. indeed, a widespreadgeneral feeling that New Zealand&apos;s civilian Avar effort is inadequate, and this feeling was heightened by Mr. Menzies&apos;s broadcast of the 17th June. This desire for greater efforts may reflect the general satisfaction at the terms of the&quot;generous&quot; agreement with the United Kingdom, by. which the latter haveguaranteed to buy all New Zealand&apos;s agricultural output.Some prominence has been given to the suggestion for an Empire War Council,so assiduously canvassed in Australia. New Zealand has not failed to note thelocal reasons for this canvass, and the general attitude may be summed up asfollows : &apos;&apos; Though the demand for an Imperial War Cabinet has little support in New Zealand, it may get more attention in the United Kingdom than itdeserves through the insistency of certain Australian newspapers.&quot; On theother hand, one newspaper considers that the German attack on Russia is an illustration of the fact that the present method of consultation with DominionGovernments is too cumbrous a procedure for the conduct of the war.There was general satisfaction that the Anzac casualties in Crete werelighter than was at first feared, and. although certain criticism came from theextreme Left, it was vigorously answered by the Acting Prime Minister.The press showed interest in the reported reform of the diplomatic service in England, which, it was thought, would strengthen economic policy. Muchinterest has also been shown in the movements of Mr. Fraser, the Prime Minister,but the principal comment on news from Europe has been concerned with theGerman attack on Russia, which came as a great surprise, the general belief being that the attack was made mainly for economic reasons. Little sympathy for, orbelief in the capacity of, Russia itself was shown at the outset, although opinionsubsequently became gradually more optimistic with the news of the stubbornRussian resistance.Some disappointment has been expressed over the progress of the Syriancampaign, which was regarded as &quot; disappointingly and dangerously slow.&quot;Mr. Quentin Reynoids&apos;s recent Sunday postscript in the B.B.C.&apos; programme had a great effect in New Zealand, where it was considered by the authorities tobe, both in form and content, &quot; admirably adapted to New Zealand audiences.&quot;8. Naval, Military and Air Activities.About 4,000 personnel of the Expeditionarv Force sailed during the month for the Middle East.Since September 1939. 41,611 Army personnel, 2,742 Air Force and 393 fleet air Arm have been sent overseas.It has been announced that 16,530 New Zealand officers and men took partin the campaigns in Greece and Crete, of whom 11,180 were evacuated, leavingapproximately 5,350 unaccounted for.Conscription is to be extended to married men, but it is not expected thatany will be called up until later in the year.A United Kingdom Military Mission under General Sir Guy Williams has arrived in New Zealand.An Aerodrome Construction Unit has been offered as the New Zealandcontribution towards the defence of Malaya and will probably sail during August.
Arrangements are being made by the New Zealand Government, inconsultation with the Ministry of Supply for the production of fuses in NewZealand to meet certain Eastern Group requirements as recommended by theDelhi Conference.9. New Zealand Surplus Produce.A reference to the statement of policy agreed with Mr. Fraser and published on the 26th June as Cmd. 6288 is included under 6 above.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.10. General Position.For the first time for some months reports of political activity in theGovernment Parties were received in the course of June. This took the form ofan attack in all the chief pro-Government papers (with the exception of those from Cape Town) on the Government for alleged failure to gear the Union to thetempo required for war. The Australian reports were the primary cause ofthis move, but criticism was general, and, in particular, exception was taken to the&quot; timid system of import priorities,&quot; despite the serious British shipping losses.This system was compared with the food storage programmes in other Dominions.A section of the Natal press also pleaded for Cabinet reconstruction on theAustralian model, in order to give a chance to younger men. It is thought thatthe Government may act on this proposal.As usual, the main political activity was shown by the Opposition Parties,and it appears now as though the Nationalists are becoming more and more openlya potential &quot; Fifth Column.&quot; For example, the Union Congress of the nationalist party, held at Bloemfontein on the 3rd June, approved the Cape Town declaration in full (see report for April) with the significant substitution of the phrase&quot;a resolute people&apos;s Government&quot; for the reference to &quot;democracy&quot;; it alsodemanded withdrawal from the war; it denounced Field-Marshal Smuts&apos;s&apos; allegedplan to subordinate South Africa to the United States of America; it protested against the &apos;&apos; persecution &apos;&apos; of Afrikanders; it reiterated its hopes for a &apos;&apos; whiteChristian&quot; Republic; called for a united front to the Opposition Parties; and,finally, conferred emergency powers on Dr. Malan as &quot; Supreme Leader,&quot;responsible to Congress alone.The reason for this elevation of Dr. Malan is that both Mr. Strydom andMr. Pirow, whose quarrel was side-tracked at the Congress, both hope to act asthe power behind the throne. Perhaps, for this reason. Dr. Malan&apos;s elevationwas not treated as significant by the Government press, to the evident annoyanceof the Nationalists. It seems clear that Dr. Malan has now accepted Mr. Pirow&apos;sthesis that Germany is bound to win the war, and that she would make a &apos;&apos; good &apos;&apos;peace with the Nationalists.On the other hand, Air. Havenga came out strongly against those who would withdraw from the Avar. His assertion that &quot; no nation is more free than SouthAfrica &quot; received a warm welcome in the English press, and the Afrikander Partyare evidently drawing nearer to the Government. On the Left, or radical wing,the Nationalists are equally embarrassed. At the Congress at Bloemfontein, two members of Ossewa Brandwag made a significant intervention, in which theyreferred to the possibility that their organisation might be compelled to use thesjambok to keep Opposition politicians all pulling in the same team.The subject of an Imperial War Cabinet has now died down, although onenewspaper suggested that there should be a War Cabinet of four in each Dominion,and that each member should in turn represent his country in London for a periodof 3 months.On other aspects of Imperial affairs, Forum drew attention to the unfortunateuse of &quot; Empire &quot; in preference to &quot; Commonwealth.&quot;The fighting in the Middle East, particularly the loss of Crete, evoked severe criticism at the beginning of the month. A Natal newspaper called the Cretecampaign a &quot;colossal mistake.&quot; The Opposition demanded the summoning ofParliament as a result of the first news released of the use of South African AirForce planes over the island.   The Opposition also made much use of Australian
criticism over Syria, the Transvaaler seizing the occasion to say that &quot; theBritish pot can no longer call the German kettle black.&quot; The pro-British presswas badly caught out by the abortive operations around Sollum, which it hadprematurely described as a victory.The recent German attack on Russia, however, caused the most bittercontroversy, particular as the Opposition members had asserted that all reportsof German troop concentrations were fabrications by the British propagandaservice, in a desperate effort to persuade the Soviet that the Germans intendedto attack. Later, the Nationalists drew attention to Mr. Hoover&apos;s reference tothe alleged change in the United States attitude as a result of Russia&apos;s entry into the war. and they even went so far as to state that the dangers to&quot; Christianity &quot; from a British victory were greater than ever.The Southern Cross (a Roman Catholic organ) praised Petain&apos;s &quot; policy ofinternal reconstruction.&apos;&apos;11. Naval, Military and Air Activities.Movement of 2nd South African Division from Union to Middle East started in June.The strength of the Union forces is now 10,162 officers and 138,638 other ranks.12. Economic Activity.Nothing to report.NEWFOUNDLAND.13. Genercd Position.The budget out-turn for the financial year, ended the 30th June, resulted in a surplus of nearly $700,000, as compai*ed with an original estimated deficit of$1,925,000. The estimates for the financial year commencing the 1st July, 1941,as revised, provide for a surplus of approximately $2,600,000. The Newfound-land Government propose to place a sum of about $2,300,000 at the disposal of theUnited Kingdom Government as an interest-free loan. They are also providing a sum of $500,000 for the purchase of aircraft, and steps are being taken to forma Newfoundland Squadron of the Royal Air Force, which will be equipped withDefiants and manned by Newfoundlanders.14. Naval, Military and. Air Activities.The result of the recruiting week is stated to have been rather disappointing,only about 100 volunteers being forthcoming. Arrangements have been made tosend suitable men round the Island to stimulate recruiting.15. Economic Activities.The Newfoundland Government have placed orders in the United kingdom for 46,500 tons of coal required for the railway. It is understood that there willbe opportunities for further sales of coal to Newfoundland if the output hereimproves sufficiently to permit of increased exports.A contract has been made for the sale of a substantial quantity of salt codfish to Portugal at a satisfactory price.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.16. Naval, Military and Air Activities.Nothing of importance to report.
EIRE.17. General Position.      qThere is very little to report on the development of Anglo-Eire relationssince last month&apos;s summary. The Managers of the first of the new ships recentlyacquired by the newly-formed Irish Shipping Company, which is virtually anorgan of the Eire Government, have applied for permission for her inclusion inan Admiralty convoy. Permission has been granted in accordance with thedecision taken by the Government last December. It is expected that the cargo of the vessel will consist principally of grain.There has for some time been an accumulation of evidence that the UnitedKingdom Government^ policy of refusing to make shipping space available&apos; forthe carriage of goods from overseas for Eire has been to a small extent circum-vented by changing the ultimate destination of the goods to Eire after shipping-space had been obtained for them on the grounds that they were consigned to theUnited Kingdom. This will in future be prevented following upon the announce-ment made by the Board of Trade on the 1st July that goods shipped to theUnited Kingdom after the 15th July for transhipment to another country must first be covered by a special licence. It is estimated that this may reduce Eire&apos;imports by more than an additional million pounds a year.At a Press conference on the 26th June President Roosevelt indicated thatthe United States might be willing to release rifles to Eire, but that there wassupply difficulty about releasing ammunition. If any releases were to be made,he would require an assurance that they would be used against any Germanattempt at invasion of Eire, an assurance which he said had not been obtainedfrom Mr. Aiken during his recent visit. It appears that the Eire newspapers(presumably acting under.Censorship instructions) did not publish the report ofwhat President Roosevelt had said until Mr. de Valera&apos;s reply was ready.Mr. de Valera stated that &quot; they were pledged to defend themselves against anattack, no matter from what quarter; it was their duty from the point of viewof neutrality and it was a precious part of their defence that outside States knewthey were united on this matter.&quot;INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.18. Political Sitttation.(i) The Congress &apos;&apos; satyagraha &apos;&apos; campaign has reached a low ebb, and a recent report described it as moribund. In some districts it has been suspendedin view of the prevailing communal tension.(ii) Although there are no signs of an improvement in communal relations,incidents, chiefly in the form of isolated acts of stabbing, were reported only fromAhmedabad and Bombay, where tension persisted from the previous month.Air. Gandhi has found it necessary to exhort his followers to display greaterheroism and self-sacrifice in the cause of non-violence when communaldisturbances break out. Communal feeling is not likely to improve if the HinduMahasabha should pursue a proposal to organise a &quot; Buy Hindu &quot; campaignwhich its Working Committee adopted in the middle of the month.(iii) Early in June the Government of India were obliged to have theKhaksars declared in all Provinces an unlawful association and their leadersarrested. The Khaksars are a militant Moslem organisation, numbering between30,000 and 40,000 professing social service as their object, but governed by a strictdiscipline in which the influence of Fascist ideas is apparent. They had planned to assemble in mosques early in June with a view to carrying out publicdemonstrations in support of their demand for the release of their founder, whowas imprisoned last year for complicity in certain riots. The Government oflndia&apos;s action was effective, and has not so far aroused any volume of protestfrom Moslem opinion.
19. Indian States.The general situation in the States resembles that in British India.Communal tension is reported from a number of States, but with no actualdisturbances. In six prominent States, including Hyderabad, the Khaksars weredeclared illegal without incident. Some labour trouble has been reported fromMysore and Gwalior. As in British India, there is increasing uneasiness aboutthe war situation and some pessimism over the possibilities of invasion.20. Military Affairs.(i) Indian forces in Iraq have been reinforced by another two infantry brigades. A further Brigade group is expected to arrive in Basra about themiddle of July.(ii) Commander-in-Chief, India, assumed operational control of all land forces in Iraq at midnight the 28th/29th June.(iii) His Majesty&apos;s Government have approved in principle the formation ofan air borne brigade in India, subject to one battalion of the brigade beingBritish.(iv) His Majesty&apos;s Government approved the Government of India&apos;s DefencePlan, 1941, based on the changed situation in the Far East, on the understandingthat it represented a long-term policy, and that the provision of the necessary equipment and air forces must be considered in relation to Imperial needs asa whole.21. Foreign and Frontier Relations.(i) Afghanistan. At a recent interview our Minister was informed that theAfghan Prime Minister had been considerably impressed by recent events in iraq and by the frequent representations made to him on the subject of the danger ofAxis activities in Afghanistan. He was now giving the matter his personalattention, and had issued orders prohibiting access by Germans and Italians tofrontier areas, especially in the Southern and Eastern Provinces. This is a very satisfactory advance on the previous attitude of the Afghan Prime Minister inthis matter, and the opportunity was taken to let him know that the reports ofthe Faqir of Ipi&apos;s connections with the Axis appear to be well founded.Negotiations for Afghan wool have resulted in the purchase of one lot of500 tons of unwashed wool and offers are being made for further quantities of wool which are now available.The first reaction in Afghanistan to the German attack on Russia is reportedto be one of pleasurable relief that a hated neighbour has been attacked byGermany. Moslem hatred of Russia&apos;s godlessness is a real sentiment in afghanistan and on the North-West Frontier, while fear of her, as in Iran, istraditional. It is probable, therefore, that Germany&apos;s action will be regarded aspraiseworthy.The Turkish Ambassador has left Kabul for Turkey on leaAre. He has saidthat he will not return there if he finds there is likelihood of Turkey beinginvolved in war. He has been a staunch friend of this country in Kabul and hasoften rendered valuable assistance, and his departure will be a loss. Steps havebeen token to have the Egyptian and Iraqi Ministers at Kabul recalled in viewof the anti-British attitude which both of them have adopted.(ii) North-West Frontier. In North Waziristan the Madda Khel gangmentioned in the last Report has remained active and has interfered with com-muni cations throughout the Tochi area. A military column has been sent up tomaintain communications and to carry out punitive measures on the tribesmenresponsible. This column has met with only slight opposition, though the Faqirof Ipi is i*eported to be trying to collect Lascars to oppose it. The latest informa-tion shows that the attitude of a Madda Khel Jirga interviewed at Razmak onthe 25th June was satisfactory. They stated that they wish to be at peace with government, and expressed their willingness to carry out Governmentsrequirements.
The trouble has not spread to South Waziristan.. where the Governor, during his visit, was presented by the Ahraadzai and Dotanni tribesmen with subscriptions-tions for the war purposes fund and assured of the loyalty of the tribes.The armistice in Iraq has had a settling effect on the tribesmen, and ingeneral it may be said that the situation on the frontier is now more encouragingthan it has been for some time past.(iii) The Persian Gulf. The Turko-German Treaty has come as anunpleasant surprise to public opinion in the Gulf. The reinforcement of british forces in Iraq and the firm handling of the pro-Nazi elements there, and the fall of Damascus have all been welcomed.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.22. General.The country generally is quiet.Dr. Ba Maw, the ex-Premier who was sentenced to a year&apos;s rigorousimprisonment in August last year for a subversive anti-war speech, and who is described by the Governor as probably the most dangerous Quisling in Burma,has been detained, on the expiry of his sentence, under the Defence of BurmaRules. This has been done after counsultation with and with the concurrence of the Home Minister.23. Defence.A second Shan States Territorial Battalion is being raised, the cost ofequipping which will be borne by the Federal Fund of the States.24. External Relations.From the 18th to the 20th June Dr. Quo Tai-Chi spent some time in Rangoonas the guest of the Governor, on his way to Chungking to take up his post asAfinister for Foreign Affairs. His visit coincided with those of Major-GeneralP. T. Mao, iissistant Director on the Commission on Aeronautical Affairs andDirector of Operations of the Chinese Air Force, and General Yu, Chairman ofthe Burma Road Control Board. Dr. Quo made a particular study of the problemof supplies for China and was concerned about the amount of war material lying-in Rangoon. He said he proposed to urge on the Generalissimo the need of more effective action to have it sent to China.General Yu had discussions with the Governor&apos;s Counsellor for external affairs regarding the constitution of the &quot; Burma Road Control Board,&quot; whichthe Chinese Government is setting up, and proposed that the Government of burma should have an official representative on it.   This has been agreed to.25. Economic Relations.Internal.- The index figures of the cost of living have risen slightly for allrace groups, and Government has decided to grant a temporary war compensatoryallowance of one rupee per month to Government employees whose pay does notexceed Rs. 30 p.m.External. Discussions have been proceeding for some time with a delegation of the Government of India on the subject of Indian immigration into Burma,and an agreement has been reached between the two Governments.Figures of the Burma Road traffic for May are not yet available. In April,according to information received since the last Report, the amount transportedinto China by the main Chinese Government Agency was 11,904 tons.[22741] c
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies inthe restricted sense, but also protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)26. Military Affairs.West Africa.(i) Reference was made in last month&apos;s report to the shortage of Europeanman power for the military forces in West Africa. This problem may be partiallymet by a proposal to make use of a number of Polish officers. This is underdiscussion between the War Office, Colonial Office and the Polish authorities.(ii) Enemy mines have been laid in Takoradi and Lagos harbours. At Lagosthe dredger Robert Hughes was sunk on the 4th June with some casualties.By the 27th June there had been six confirmed explosions Mine-sweepingoperations on the 27th June at Takoradi resulted in one mine being found anddetonated without damage. At Accra the M.V. Sangara exploded while at anchoron the 30th May, and the Government reported on the 22nd June that theSalvage Officer working on the ship found what appeared to be a portion of a torpedo bearing lettering in German.27. French Affairs.(i) Vichy consular representatives.In view of the policy of closer collaboration with Germany adopted by the vichy Government, Vichy consular establishments and agencies in the colonial empire are being closed. Exceptions are being made in the case of the straits settlements and Hong Kong, since British consular representatives are stillallowed to function in Indo-China; and in the case of Malta, where the consularrepresentative, while adhering nominally to Vichy, is, in fact, acting as general de Gaulle&apos;s representative.(ii) Conferences - between British, Free French and Belgian Colonial repre-sentatives.Arrangements are being made for periodical informal conferences to be held between the Chairman of the West African Governors&apos; Conference, the HighCommissioner for Free French Africa and the Governor-General of the belgian congo. These arrangements have the full support of the Belgian and Free french authorities in London, who share the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government thatsuch conferences are likely to be of great benefit in the co-ordination of policy inthe West African area and in the promotion of inter-Allied Colonial co-operation in political, military and economic matters. The first conference will be held very shortly at Lagos.(iii) Propaganda directed towurds French West Africa.A considerable volume of propaganda by wireless, leaflets and other methodsis directed towards French West Africa from British Colonies in the west african area. Material for such propaganda is supplied to a large extentthrough the Colonial Office, and arrangements have now been made to widen thescope and regularise the despatch of such material. The directions sent throughthe Colonial Office now include political material for open use, designed to enablethe Colonial Government to exploit developments in the international field as quickly and fully as possible, and certain material for subversive use amongstnon-French populations, as well as the economic material which has been sent at approximately weekly intervals for the past three months. A good deal of this material is prepared&apos;in the Colonial Office itself, but it is, of course, drafted inthe closest consultation with the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Information.
28. Economic Affairs.(i) Import Control.The West Indian Governments are now proposing to hold a conference toconsider what suitable joint measures can be taken to perfect the import licensing system in their area.(ii) Middle East Supply Centre.The Government of Aden has now agreed that it should be brought within thescope of this Centre.(iii) Supply of Colonial requirements from, the United States.It is hoped that it may be possible to obtain many essential requirements for colonies under Lease-Lend, and in any case it is anticipated that government intervention will be necessary in order to secure supplies of critical commodities in view of the control over exports which is being instituted in America. Thehead of the Economic Department of the Colonial Office is accordingly being sentat a very early date to Washington to discuss with the American authorities andthe British Purchasing Commission the organisation which it will be necessaryto set up to deal with these matters.(iv) Rubber.All rubber-buying for America, both for the reserve stock and current consumption, is now centralised in the Rubber Reserve Company, and no export licences for shipment of rubber to the United States from Malaya or Ceylon are issued unless the rubber is consigned to the Reserve Company or its nominees.Reports on Particular Colonies.29. West A frita.Mr. A. J. Dawe, C.M.G.. O.B.E., Assistant Under-Secretary of State,Colonial Office, left for West Africa on the 27th June by air. He will consult with the Chairman of the West African Governors&apos; Conference at Lagos, on anumber of matters in which oral discussion will be of advantage, and will visit the Governors of the other West African Colonies in their territories.30. Sierra Leone.The Acting Governor reported on the 14th June that the employees of thesierra Leone Coaling Company refused to work on the 3rd June and walkedout without making specific demands. On the following day they made demands for approximately 50 per cent, increase in wages and a decrease in hours oflabour.On the 8th June they returned on condition that they should be paid atjob rates, which are 33^ per cent, higher than normal rates, pending the settle-ment of their dispute by an arbitration tribunal. The tribunal, with the Acting-Chief Labour Officer as arbitrator and with assessors nominated by the company and by the workmen, is now sitting. Representations are also said to have beenmade by the Sierra Leone Building Constructional Workers&apos; Union and theWater-front Workers&apos; Union for higher rates of pay on account of the risingcost of living.[These incidents are mentioned in view of the strategic importance ofFreetown. Important works for the R.A.F. also are in progress in the Colonvand numbers of local labourers are employed upon them. The labour positionis being carefully watched by the local authorities.]31. Mauritius.As an expression of their desire to support the Government in all measuresdeemed necessary to enable the Colony to play a full and effective part in the prosecution of the war, the Council of Government in Mauritius have for the*&quot;second year in succession passed without discussion the Annual Estimates, which included measures for raising additional revenue. This was done at the instanceof the Elected Members.[22741] D
32. Malta.A report on enemy activity during May states that, after the first week, air raids slackened and for the rest of the month were on a comparatively small scale. There were forty air raids during the month, of which eighteen were by day. Twenty persons were killed and 440 houses or shops demolished or partlydamaged.Proposals for the payment of compensation in respect of personal injuriesarising from enemy action and in respect of war damage have now- been drafted by the Malta Government in the light of the corresponding legislation in thiscountry. It is expected that the scheme for compensation for personal injurieswill be introduced in the course of the next few weeks.A survey of the air raid shelter situation was completed during June. Itshowed that on the 1st May rock shelters for 139,000 people had been provided.The purpose in view is to provide rock shelters for the whole population, and onthat basis shelter for 130,000 people was still required. Of these people 63,000can be provided with accommodation in concrete and private shelters, but the popular demand (which the Government feels it necessary to meet) is for rockshelters for everybody. The Governor has prepared a programme of construction which is estimated to cost over  500.000 during 1941, and this programme hasbeen approved.The experience of the air raids in March showed that the fire-fightingorganisation in Valetta and the Three Cities needed overhauling. The LondonFire Brigade were approached and an expert from their staff is now in Malta toadvise the Government.33.   Gibraltar.The evacuation of the civilian population proceeds. A further contingent of some 400 persons is expected to leave in July. This will complete the evacua-tion unless and until siege becomes imminent, when some 2,000-3,000 additionalpeople will be removed, if arrangements can be made.34. Cyprus.The evacuation of British people, Poles and Jews from Cyprus was com-pleted during June.News of the German attack on Russia was received in Cyprus with relief, asthe people feel that the invasion of Cyprus has for the present been averted.The strikes mentioned in the report for May have been settled.      :&apos;There has been slight intermittent bombing of Cyprus by the enemy during june.   But casualties have been few and damage small.35. Palestine.There has been little local political activity amongst the Arabs, but the mufti&apos;s supporters, who had enjoyed threatening their opponents with the wrathto come when Haj Amin arrived with a victorious Iraq army, have now beendisconcerted.To the great majority of Arabs Crete was too far away to create muchimpression. The collapse of Rashid Ali&apos;s regime was generally welcomed, andthe general view is that Rashid Ali brought shame to the Arab world. Reiteratedassurances that we have no designs on Iraq had a good effect. Mr.hEden&apos;sstatement on Syria and Arab unity met with some appreciation, but also withsome criticism on the score of vagueness and omission of any mention of Palestine.Our entry into Syria and the prospect of Syrian independence is generallyvery popular amongst the Arabs, though here again there is a tendency to make some capital by saying that there is hope for everyone except the Arabs ofPalestine. Prospects of closer economic relations between these sister countries are welcomed.Jewish apprehensions were deepened by the evacuation of Crete and earlier in the month by the apparent freedom of action of the Germans in Syria; but our entry into Syria revived confidence. The entry of Russia into the war againstGermany had a very enlivening effect on the spirits of the Jewish community,illustrated by the rise by 1\ points in local stocks on Tel Aviv stock exchange.
Hostile aircraft were over Palestine on several occasions during the month,and there were raids on Haifa on the 10th, 12th, 14th and 25th June, and onTel Aviv and Acre on the 12th June.   Damage and casualties were small.Recruiting has steadily improved during the month, particularly for thePalestine companies of the Buffs and for the R.A.S.C.There has been some diminution in lawlessness. Fewer gangs were active,and while there were two instances of firing at troops, there is nothing to suggestthat the motive was other than mischief. The Police continued to effectsatisfactorily seizures of arms and ammunition.Transjordan remains normal.36. Aden Protectorate.Mr. Ingrams, the Chief Secretary at Aden, who has recently returned toAden from the Yemen, took advantage of his visit to Sana to discuss theDar-al-Beidha frontier affair with the Yemeni authorities. Their attitude wasfriendly, but the King of the Yemen was inclined to dispute the fact that theDar (a small &quot; fort &quot;) is within the Protectorate boundary. The Governor hasbeen authorised, to use force if necessary, in consultation with the service authorities, against the Dar.37. Ceylon.The Governor has recently reported that the Ceylon Board of Ministers aremaking a move for the reopening of conversations with the Government of india on the question of Indians in Ceylon. Two of the Ministers, who have associated themselves with extreme Sinhalese nationalist views on the matter, have dissentedfrom this policy. No details have yet been received as to the new proposals ofthe Ceylon Ministers, but the Governor has reason to think that they will providea basis for discussion acceptable to moderate opinion in India.*38. Malaya.In view of recent disturbances among Indian labour employed on rubberestates in the Federated Malay States, arrangements have been made for major Orde Browne, my Labour Adviser, to visit Malaya on the conclusion ofhis present visit to Mauritius. His advice will be available generally to the malayan Administrations, and it is felt that his recent study of politico-economiccauses of unrest among Indian labourers in Ceylon should be relevant to conditions in Malaya,39. Hong Kong.Sir Geoffrey Northcote is retiring shortly from the governorship on thegrounds of ill-health, and Sir Mark Young, at present Governor of TanganyikaTerritory, who has been appointed to succeed him, is expected to assume thegovernment about the end of August.There has been considerable Japanese naval activity in the waters aroundHong Kong, and many junks plying between Hong Kong and the Chinese coasthave been destroyed by Japanese patrol vessels. Japanese forces were also reported to have occupied two groups of small islands lying a few miles southof Hong Kong waters. There have been some petty exhibitions of unfriendliness,inspired or connived at by Japanese military forces, towards British police andmilitary posts on the part of Chinese in a border village on the Colony&apos;s landfrontier, but assurances that these will be repressed have been received from theJapanese Command in the area.Great George Street, S.W.1,July 21, 1941.
