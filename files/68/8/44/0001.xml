COMMODITY SUPPLY POSITIONENERGY FOODSThe reserve stock of wheat and flour continues to grow and there(carbohydrates)  is a slight improvement in the proportion of flour in the total;rice stocks are increasing;   present&apos;sugar stocks should be maintaincthroughout the summer;    the remaining stocks of 1940. main croppotatoes are adequate.Wheat &amp; flour:  (i) The reserve stock of wheat and flour, whichstood at approximately 13 weeks1 flourrequirements at end-May is expected toincrease to approximately 17 weeks1requirements by the end of August.(ii) Arrivals of flour averaged 12 thousand tons aweek in May;    in Juno/August they are forecast at 24 thousand tons a week.(iii) If the output of TLX.  flour mills is not reducedby air attack the reserve stock of flour should reach 5^ weeks1 supply by the end of August, ascompared -with 4 weeks1  supply at end-May.(iv) No complaints or difficulties have arisen fromthe increase in the extraction rate from 73f3 ^oiSfo.Oatmeal: Production of oatmeal and rolled oats continues to decline as a result of short supplies of oats.     the weekly average output in May Was 1.9 thousand tons as compared with 2. 2 thousand tons in April and 2.7in March.Rice:(i) Stocks of whole rice increased as expected during may and will probably continue to rise in theperiod June/August.(ii) June loadings of rice in India and Burma will be heavy.In May the index of total stocks increased slightly and theindex of stocks of imported foods increased substantially.The large increase in total stocks shown for end-August 1941is mainly attributable to the inclusion of the new home.wheat crop(estimated).      The improvement as against August 1940 isprincipally due to larger (forecast) stocks of wheat and sugar.INDICES OF STOCKS OF PRINCIPAL FOODS,, BASED ON CALORIE VALUES
Sugar: (i) Arrivals should be sufficient to moot the seasonallyheavy consumption during the period June/August and little change in stocks during the period is foreseen.(ii) End-August total stocks are forecast at oOO thousand tons as compared with 341 thousand tons at end-August, 1940.Potatoes;    The quality of the  stocks of the 19k0 mc.lv. crop isexcellent and the quantity should be sufficient to meet requirements during the remainder of the season.     The1941 crop of new potatoes has boor, delayed by weather conditions.G-Y(f,FOODS The soft oil stock position continues to improve and novts) further deterioration in the hard oil position is expected;linseed stocks will fall in the immediate future;    stocks of margarine and lard continue to increase;    butter stocks are large.Oilseeds &amp; (i) Total stocks of oilseeds and:vegetable:oils arevegetable oils expected to be maintained in June and July.      some increase is forecast for August.(ii) The upward trend in the soft oil stock position was continued in May and some further improvement isexpected in June and July.(iii) The hard oil stock position deteriorated further in May but heavy shipments of &quot;7est African palmkernels have been araanged for June and July and stocks at end-August are expected to be doublethose of end-May.(iv) The short-term outlook for linseed is poor but a recovery in stocks should begin in August.Margarine &amp; (i) Margarine production .vas temporarily reduced in Maycompound Lard,  to permit an increased output of compound lard butthere was 210 interruption in the building up of stocks of margarine.&apos;   Little further expansion of stocks is possible because of storage difficulties,,(ii) Total stocks of lard and compound lard are expectedto increase considerably in June/August3 as a reductionof home production of compound lard in those monthsis expected to be more than offset by imports of animal lard from the U.S.A.Butter:       Bulk stocks rose to the high level of 45 thousand tons at end -May as a result of heavy arrivals.     Arrivalsin June/August will be on a smaller scale but owing tothe reduction of the allowance from Lozz, to 2oss. atthe end of June the decline in bulk stdeks &quot;will not besteep.SillFOODSA considerable expansion of meat and corned beef arrivals isexpected;    bacon supplies are being maintained;    cheese stocks areexpanding and the ration is to bo increased.Meat: (i) Arrivals which averaged 16 thousand tons a weekduring April and May are expected to increase to anaverage of 21 thousand tons a week in June/August.(ii) Home killed meat during June,and July will be at a-seasonal low level.     Some improvement is expected in August.     These forecasts take no account ofslaughtering designed to reduce the livestockpopulation.
Bacon:(iii) Higher arrivals will more than offset the decline in home production during June and July.(iy) The de-rationing of offal as from 9th June will increase the weekly issue of carcase meat underbutchers1  general buying permits by It? thousand tonsor about 6igb*(i) Home production declined from 4 thousand tons a weeknd is expected to fall to lesjm Aorxl too in ftiay than 2.0 in August.(ii) Arrivals in June/August are expected to offset thedecline in home production, but the stock position will deteriorate as part of the imports from the U.S.Awill not be suitable for issue against the ration. .Corned Beef: Heavy arrivals are expected in June/August.     Stocks at end-May were 110 thousand tons; the forecast for end-Augustis 166 thousand tons.Fish:^ggsCheese:(i) British landings in May were heavier than in April and prices tended to be lc or.(ii) Maximum prices orders for all types of fish will comeinto opex-ation before the beginning of July,    Costs ofcarriage on white fish will be paid by the Ministry forthe first three months of general price control toensure more even distribute on. throughout the country.,(i) Supplies in May were approximately the same as in April.In June heavy arrivals from Canada and the U.S.A.  arelikely to increase total supplies.    There will be a sharp fall in supplies in July and August because eggshipments from North America in non-refrigerated spacewill be suspended until September,,(ii) The machinery for controlling the distribution of home produced eggs is being set up and should be ready for operation at an early date,Imports and home production in June/August are expected tobe sufficient to meet the ordinary ration (which will beraised from 1 os.  to 2 oss.  at the end of Juno) end theoz. ra.tion for priori-cy c.-asses and to oermitconsiderable building up&apos;of stocks,PROTECT PTE A small reduction of milk consumption was effected by the modifiedFOODS restriction order;    a considerable expansion of condensed milk stocks is forecast;    allocations of dried fruit are likely to increasej arrival?oranges will not be large.   .of &quot; summer&apos;Fresh milk:condensed milk:Fresh fruit;Jan andmarmalade:The reduction in consumption effected by the modified orderrestricting milk sales is estimated at not more than 5%Consumption in May 1941 showed an increase of 15% over thatin May, 1940.As a result of prospective supplies from the U.S.A. and the seasonal increase in home production, stocks of condensed milk arc expected to increase from 37 thousand tons at end-May to 119 thousand tons at end --August.    - Stocks of driedmilk in the period are likely to increase from 9 thousand tons to 15 thousand tons.Arrivals of &quot;summer&quot; season ,(May-Nov ember) - oranges have beguThey are not likely to exceed 40 thousand tons as comparedwith 140 thousand tons in 1940.The sweet preserves ration is now -g- lb. per month instead 01being on a &quot;minimum share&quot; basis and will be increased tc1 lb. per month in August.

End-August stocks are forecast at205 thousand tons as compared with 94 thousand tons at end-April.Requisitions of food up to 31st May totalled 231,000 tons, includingevaporated milk (46,000 tons), dried fruit (30,000 tons), cheese (22,000tons), canned meat(14,000 tons), egg products (13,000 tons), bacon(13,000 tons), eggs in shell (11,000 tons) and canned fish (10,500 tons).V.
