Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (R) (41) 21.March 19, 1941.WAR CABINET.REPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 1941 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES, PROTEC-TORATES AND MANDATED TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for the Dominions.CANADA.1. General Position.THE main interest inside the Dominion has been focussed on the progressof the war effort. The press as a whole expressed doubts about the quality ofnational leadership, and attention was, in particular, drawn to alleged short-comings in the production of aircraft. These misgivings are confirmed in anunpublished message from the Toronto correspondent of the London Times, whofeels that the absence of firm Cabinet control has led to an intensification of therivalry between certain Ministers, e.g., Mr. Howe (Minister of Munitions and supply) and Mr. MacMillan (Chairman of the Wartime Requirements Board).The press has recently urged the formation of an all-party National Government,with strong inner Cabinet control. This campaign, which is supported by the leader of the Opposition (Mr. Hanson) is, however, vitiated to some extent bythe dearth of Opposition talent.Other proposals in regard to the war are that Canada&apos;s main effort shouldbe, not in the preparation of a land army, but rather in industry, andparticularly the aircraft industry, and in the building of merchant rather thanwar ships.Recent speeches by the United Kingdom Prime Minister, and those ofMr. Alexander and Mr. Bevin, have been particularly well received, while LordBeaverbrook&apos;s broadcast is said to have greatly aided those Canadians who desireto see a large increase in the Canadian war effort. The death of Sir FrederickBanting, the Canadian scientist, in an air accident, is felt to be a great loss, as was that also of Dr. Skelton, the Deputy Minister of External Affairs since 1925.Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s new finance proposals, though &quot; startling,&quot; have been widely welcomed as being realistic; and the savings campaign has provedsuccessful, particularly in Toronto.The appointment of Mr. MacDonald as High Commissioner for the UnitedKingdom has received highly favourable comment both on the grounds of hisstatus as a Cabinet Minister and of his personal knowledge of Canada.Mr. Leighton McCarthy, K.C., has been appointed to succeed Mr. LoringChristie as Canadian Minister at Washington.Press comment on events outside Canada differs little from that of the UnitedKingdom. The French Catholic papers, to which Laval is now anathema, retain[22335] B
respect for Marshal Petain, and he and General de Gaulle are now coupled asdisinterested servants of France. The French press even goes so far as to condemnthe Hoover campaign for sending food ships to Europe.Unfavourable comment on&quot; Mr. de Valera&apos;s attitude in regard to the neutrality of Fire continues to appear.2. Naval, Military and A ir A activities.The first five companies of the Canadian Forestry Corps arrived in theUnited Kingdom during February.An agreement, implementing Article XV of the Empire Air Training-Scheme Agreement, was negotiated with the Canadian Government duringMr. Ralston&apos;s recent visit to the United Kingdom. Under Article XVthe United Kingdom Government had undertaken that pupils trainedunder the scheme would, after training, be identified with their respectiveDominions. The manner in Avhich such identification was to be effected was left for subsequent discussion. The new agreement which was signed before mr. Ralston&apos;s return to Canada in January provides for the formation, inaddition to the three R.C.A.F. squadrons already in the United Kingdom, of twenty-five R.C.A.F. squadrons out of the output of Canadian trainees. these squadrons will be at the disposal of and paid for by the United KingdomGovernment.The February output of air-crews from the Empire Air Training Scheme inCanada was 564, of whom 495 (169 pilots. 119 observers and 207 wirelessoperator/air gunners) were sent to the United Kingdom.Correspondence is proceeding with the Canadian Government on the difficult question of the interception and diversion to Canadian ports of neutral vesselscarrying contraband to ports in the Far East. Influenced by the continuedrefusal of the United States Government to acquiesce in proposals for the inter-ception of such vessels in the Caribbean, the Canadian Government have so farfelt unable to co-operate in interceptions in the Pacific. A strong appeal has.however, been made to them to reconsider their attitude on this question.3. Economic Activities.Discussions are in progress between Sir Frederick Phillips and Mr. Clark,the Canadian Deputy Minister of Finance, with regard to the measure of further financial assistance which Canada can give to this country. In the meantime theCanadian Government are providing the balance of Canadian dollars needed forour purchases and commitments there. Discussions will be necessary shortlyon important economic questions affecting the United Kingdom and Canadawhich arise from the passage of the Lease-Lend Bill.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.4. General Position.The main event, which has done much to shake general complacency, hasbeen the sudden increase of tension in the Pacific. The prospect of war with japan has led to a general press campaign stressing the indivisibility of theEmpire, since it is feared that Japan believes in the existence of dividedcounsels, as shown by the recent conciliatoiy statements of certain commonwealth ministers.On the 6th February Mr. Fadden, the Acting Prime Minister, andMr. Curtin, the Leader of the Opposition, issued a statement warning Australiaof the serious international situation, and appealing for the maximum effort tomeet the demands of the months immediately ahead. The joint statement isreported by the United Kingdom High Commissioner as having had a salutary effect in dispelling complacency, particularly in labour circles. Nevertheless,attention appears to have slackened after the news of Imperial moves in the threatened areas, although the accounts of the Australian landing at Singaporereceived universal press approval. The Melbourne Argus on the 20th Februarysaid : &quot; livery bushman knows that the most effective way to stop a fire is not to wait until it comes, but to clear a belt beyond the threatened point; and for us that belt begins at Singapore and runs North.&quot;
NEW ZEALAND.7. General Position.New Zealand has been affected, though to a lesser extent than Australia, bythe recent increase of tension in the Pacific. Indeed, at the beginning of themonth, public opinion was still exercised by post-war marketing problems, since it is feared that the revival of British agriculture will seriously affect NewZealand exports. This fear was somewhat allayed by the statement that the NewZealand Government would guarantee all ultimate purchases. Towards themiddle of the month the warning of Australian Ministers of the potentiallydangerous situation in regard to Japan was noted with anxiety, and on the15th, Mr. Fraser, the Prime Minister, made a statement in support of theCommonwealth attitude. The public&quot; reaction to this was, however, somewhatsluggish, and optimism quickly revived with news of the moves in Malaya.Interest thereupon shifted to reports of United Kingdom moves for the substrtu-tion of wool by cotton; to complaints about the censorship; and to discussion aboutthe requisitioning of Dominion sterling securities. Mr. Matsuoka&apos;s indiscretionsabout Japanese claims in &quot;Oceania&quot; did not arouse much alarm, and an[22335] b one result of the tension has been the renewed demand for a national government. Mr. Forgan Smith, the Premier of Queensland, urged the workersin that State to &quot; work like hell and fight like hell.&quot; This was followed on the10th February by a warning by Mr. Curtin to the Australian Workers&quot; Union,that in the face of imminent danger Australia could no longer afford the luxuryof industrial disputes.Comment on world affairs outside Australia follows the usual lines, but therehave been renewed protests against the operation of the British censorship, andalso complaints of a lack of co-ordination in publicity between Malaya and theCommonwealth.Mr. Menzies&apos;&apos; recent declaration that &quot; so long as Australia has resources ofany description Britain will not stand alone&quot; has been well received. press comment was that &quot; these were no mere formal words. They interpret the feelingand will of Australians.&quot;Commenting on reports that the Commonwealth Government were con-sidering the appointment of a Minister to China, the Melbourne Argus urgesdirect Australian representation also in Thailand and the Netherlands east indies.5. Naval, Military and Air Activities.Mr. Menzies, the Commonwealth Prime Minister, arrived in the UnitedKingdom on the 20th February, and at once entered upon a series of meetings and conferences with United Kingdom Ministers.An Australian Infantry Brigade and attached troops arrived in Malaya.The Commonwealth Government has agreed to despatch to Malaya personnel for two Reserve Mechanical Transport Companies and a Motor Ambulance Convoy.The Australian Brigade which had been diverted to this country last summerhas now arrived in the Middle East. Reinforcements and subsidiary unitscontinue to reach the same area from Australia.The Commonwealth Government has offered to form an additional army co-operation Squadron of the R.A.A.F. for service in the Middle East. Theoffer has been accepted.In view of the Far Eastern situation, certain local defence measures havebeen taken in Australia, such as the continuous manning of all coast and anti-aircraft defences and the movement of units to certain strategicallyimportant areas.An Australian delegation (representing also New Zealand) has attendedfurther defence discussions at Singapore.6. Economic Activities.Nothing of importance to record.
Opposition proposal for a non-party National Government seems to have lesssupport than similar proposals elsewhere in the Empire.Air Marshal Sir Cyril Newall, Governor-General in succession toViscount Galway, was sworn in at Wellington on the 22nd February.8. Naval, Military and Air Activities.The New Zealand Brigade, which was diverted to the United Kingdom last summer, arrived recently in the Middle East, to which the other two Brigades ofthe New Zealand Division had proceeded direct. Other troops have arrived inthe same area from New Zealand.9. Economic Activities.Nothing of importance to record.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.10. General Position.A progressive decline in the strength of the Opposition took place during february, owing partly to the split in the ranks caused by the activities of theOssewa Brandwag, and Mr. Pirow&apos;s dubious Fascist moves within the Re-united party on the one hand, and on the other by those of the Hertzog party now led by General Conroy.The month started with the issue of the National Security Regulations, thepromulgation of which had been hastened by the Johannesburg riots. On the4th February, Dr. Malan led a motion of &quot; no confidence &quot; in Parliament. In thecourse of his speech, he criticised British war aims and made a bitter complaintabout the Government&apos;s alleged plans for a &quot; greater South Africa &quot; which, hesaid, would lead to a swamping of the white elements, and to an internal &quot; reignof terror.&quot; The motion, which was supported by the Hertzog &quot; Afrikaner UnionParty,&quot; was defeated on the 8th February by 78 votes to 59. An amendment,moved by the Minister of Finance, approving the Governments internal policy,was passed by 76 votes to 59, the two representatives of the native element, whovoted for the Government on the first motion, abstaining.The greater part of February was thereafter occupied; in so far as theOpposition was concerned, by the internal struggle within the Re-united Party.Desperate efforts are being made to keep Mr. Pirow within the fold, and attacks on his &quot; New Order &quot; have ceased, despite a formal denunciation of his openlyFascist doctrines by the Dutch Reformed Church.Meanwhile, the strength of the Government has been continually increasing,not only on account of the weakness of its opponents, but also because of such factors as the successful campaign in the North; the general prosperity of the farmers (shown by the fact that the Land Bank has only required one quarterof the additional capital recently provided by the Government) and the visit ofthe Belgian Minister of Colonies, M. Vleeschauwer, who, as a member of theFlemish race, was regarded by the pro-Government press as bearing a specialmessage of racial co-operation to the Union. It was in these circumstances thatthe Commandant-General of the Ossewa Brandwag was injudicious enough toboast of his organisation^ strength within the South African Railway Adminis-tration, the most important single body in the Union. A press campaign wasinstantly started for the banning of State employees&apos; membership of theorganisation, and at the beginning of March General Smuts found himself strong-enough to carry this into effect.Press comment on the world situation followed the usual party lines. an example of the Opposition^ perversion of facts is the statement that not onlyare the Roumanian oil-fields out of range of British bombers, but that, in anycase, Germany is now in no need of oil. Mr. Willkie&apos;s message to Germany, whichwas well received by pro-Government papers, was ignored by the Opposition press,which, instead, inveighed against the union of the &quot; reactionary capitalism &quot; ofthe United Kingdom and the U.S.A.
The quick action taken to despatch United Kingdom and Australianreinforcements to Singapore is felt by the press generally to have been a salutarywarning to Japan.11. Naval, Military and Air Activities.General Smuts recently visited East Africa where he met the C.I.G.S. andthe C.I.G., Middle East, and discussed Avith them the destination of the 2nd UnionDivision. Meanwhile, the 1st Union Division and units of the S.A.A.F. have continued active operations in East Africa.The total strength of the Union forces is now 128,500 Europeans and27,500 non-Europeans, making a total of 156,000, of whom over 35,000 ai*e in east Africa.The Union has offered to provide sufficient Union pupils to fill a considerable part of the intake of the R.A.F. flying training schools which have beentransferred to the Union and, until flying training facilities in the Union havebeen fully expanded, to fill vacancies at schools in Southern Rhodesia. All suchpupils will be volunteers for service anywhere with the R.A.F. On posting tothe R.A.F. after training they will remain members of the S.A.A.F. and be paidby the Union, unless posted outside Africa. Colonel Tasker, Director of flying training in the Union, has arrived in the United Kingdom on a six months&apos; visit to supplement liaison with the Air Ministry and to discuss problems arising outof the expansion of air training in the Union.12. Economic Activities.Nothing of importance to record.NEWFOUNDLAND.13. General Position.Agreement is in sight on most of the outstanding points in connection withthe terms on which the control of the air bases in Newfoundland is being-transferred for the duration of the war to the Government of Canada. The AirMinistry have, however, now decided that they should retain control of theW.T. installation themselves, and this decision has a bearing on the financial arrangements.Discussions with the American Delegation regarding the lease of naval andair bases to the United States are continuing in London. Two members of theCommission of Government have taken an active part in the negotiations. TheUnited States authorities have selected four sites in Newfoundland for lease,but their requirements are not yet exactly known in all cases. Work is continuing at Argentia, and agreement has been reached on the method of determining compensation to inhabitants who have been dispossessed.14. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.The 14th Contingent of recruits for the Royal Navy (166) is en route. Whenthey arrive the number of Newfoundland Naval Ratings employed in the royal navy will be about 2,500.15. Economic Activities.Owing to increasing difficulties in connection with the dollar sterlingexchange and shipping, the outlook for the export trade in pitprops, frozensalmon, &amp;c, is not hopeful. Newfoundland is, however, continuing to supplyfrozen cod fillets to the extent of its capacity.
16. SOUTHERN RHODESIA.(Nothing of importance to report.)EIRE.17. General Position.The attitude of Eire public opinion towards the United Kingdom and thewar continues to develop under two main influences. On the one hand there isthe desire, hitherto almost universal in Eire, at almost any cost to keep out ofthe war. The other is the fear that Eire may be dragged in despite herself, either by German invasion or because British and now also United States pressure to-secure &quot; the ports &quot; will reach an intensity where passive resistance is no longer possible. Public discussion of these momentous issues continues to be stifled bythe severe censorship : but there is evidence of a growing uneasiness in informedquarters at the increasing isolation of Eire in the face of opinion in this countryand, more important to Eire, in the United States. The passage of the lease and Lend Act has given rise to searchings of heart in Eire. Mr. Willkie&apos;s interview with Mr. de Valera at the beginning of February has been followed bya visit from Colonel Donovan early in March. Finally, although earlier in themonth Mr. Cosgrave, the leader of the Fine Gael party which opposesMr. de Valera in the Dail, repeated the support of his party for the policy of neutrality, we know that Mr. James Dillon, the deputy leader of the party anda member of the Dail, is prepared to come out at the right moment in support ofabandonment of neutrality.The policy of denying to Eire space in United Kingdom registered or controlled ships is being maintained, and that of limiting the export from thiscountry to Eire of goods in short supply here continues to be applied withgradually but steadily increasing intensity in accordance with our increasing-needs. Memoranda have been received from the Eire Government asking for shipping or, alternatively., supplies of goods normally imported into Eire inchartered vessels, and asking also for petroleum supplies. Replies have been sentregretting our inability in present circumstances to assist with shipping or togive any guarantee in regard to the supply of the main bulk commodities. Wehave also been unable to agree to supply Eire with more than 50 per cent, of herpre-war consumption of petroleum products.. In an effort to secure from the United States what they have been unable toget from this country, the Eire Government have despatched Mr. Aiken, the eire Minister for Defence Co-ordination, on a mission to the United States.The professed object of the mission is to ask for arms and ammunition, but it isknown that he is also seeking ships and supplies generally, especially wheat.It is understood that the United States Government are proposing to extend acourteous and sympathetic reception to the Mission, but will point out that, sincethe supply of military equipment of all kinds is subject to priority contracts with Great Britain. Greece and Turkey, Eire&apos;s only hope of obtaining arms is tomake arrangements Avith the British Purchasing Commission. The commission have, however, been instructed that the placing of future orders on behalf of eire should be dealt with direct by Eire and not through the Commission.Mr. de Valera stated in the Dail in the last week of February that nine Eireregistered ships had been lost at sea since September 1939. He also gave detailsof ten attacks on Eire shipping, of which seven were from the air. In all but one of the seven, the markings of the attacking aircraft were identified as German.German and British planes continue to crash or make forced landings in eire, their surviving crews being interned. A German bomber crashed nearRosslare, County Wexford, on the 3rd March. A German parachutist recentlylanded and has been taken up by the Eire authorities.Eire is suffering from a severe outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease-the firstfor many years. There have been numerous cases widely spread over the whole country, and the import of live cattle from Eire to this country has consequentlybeen prohibited. This has added a further if fortuitous strain to Eire&apos;s economic system by spreading into the farming community some part of the distresspreviously borne by the unemployed urban population.
INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.18. Political Situation.There is nothing of consequence to report during the month under this head.Gandhi&apos;s anti-war campaign is continuing its course and by the end of the monthsome 4,500 persons had been convicted, the majority of them having been sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. But it is becoming increasingly clear that a campaign the participants in which act with no real convictions behind them hasnot so far seized upon the public imagination and, indeed, in some areas isshowing signs of being regarded as a nuisance. The list of candidates for arrestis still subject to personal scrutiny and approval by Gandhi himself, but theirquality is becoming progressively inferior.The constitutional deadlock remains complete and there seems no likelihood of anything happening which will avoid the necessity of seeking from both houses of Parliament before the end of April the Resolution which is required under theprovisions of the Government of India Act to retain in being after that date thepowers under which seven Provinces have been administered by their Governorssince the autumn of 1939. Similar resolutions were adopted in April last year,hut had effect for only one year.19. Military Affairs.(a) The dates for the reinforcement of Malaya and Burma from India havehcen revised and it is now expected that (1) The movement of a brigade group to Burma will commence at the end ofMarch.(2) The division for Malaya will move from India during March and earlyApril with the exception of certain divisional troops units which willnot be ready until later.These forces are being equipped by India at the best scale that Indian resourceswill permit and will be completed to their full scale as quotas of equipment fromthe United Kingdom arrive.(b) The Viceroy&apos;s proposal to expand the Indian Air Force to 15 squadronshy 1943 has been examined by the Air Ministry. They are unable to provide theessential British personnel for training and maintenance for the 1941 phase ofthe expansion, or to guarantee the requisite aircraft and equipment. TheGovernment of India are being asked to consider a less ambitious programme which, in its initial stages at least, can be carried out within their own existing resources.(c) Arrangements are now being made to provide India with 71 Lysanderaircraft to re-equip their Army Co-operation squadrons. Forty-one of the air-frames required are being purchased from Canada and the remainder, togetherwith the necessary engines, armament, &amp;c, are being supplied from this country.(d) The Government of India have offered to send the personnel for threeanimal transport companies to the United Kingdom in March. There are alreadythree companies here.20. Foreign and Frontier Relations.(a) Afghanistan. His Majesty&apos;s Minister has received, reliable information that German engineers belonging to the Lufthansa organisation are erecting a wireless station on the Herat aerodrome which will shortly be completed. Thisaerodrome is also reported to have been enlarged and improved, and the minister thinks that these activities suggest that the Lufthansa air service to Afghanistanmay be restarted in the spring. In view of this possibility, the question isunder urgent consideration of at once approaching the Afghan Government for permission to start a British service between Kabul and Lahore, which would linkup with other services of Indian National Airways between Lahore and Karachiand Lahore and Calcutta.
The Afghan Minister for National Economy, Abdul Majid, is now in Europe,ostensibly for reasons of health. He has passed through Istanbul and is nowbelieved to be on his way to Germany.An Afghan trade mission of 7 persons, both officials and traders, has now left for Tokyo at the invitation of the Japanese Government.(b) North-West Frontier. In North Waziristan the hostile activities ofShodi Khei!s gang referred to in last montlrs summary have continued, despite the death of Shodi Khel himself by air action early in the month. In SouthWaziristan also hostile gangs have caused trouble, particularly in the way ofinterfering with security on &apos;the roads, but there has been a general improvementin the situation. On the 10th February a gang held up a car on the Kohat-Thalroad, killing one British officer and wounding another. Fines have been imposed on the tribesmen responsible.   Otherwise the Frontier remains quiet.(e) Sinkiang.  The latest news from the new British Consul-General.Mr. Eric Shipton, is to the effect that there has been an intensification of anti-British activities in Sinkiang, particularly in Yarkand. Twenty-five Britishsubjects have been deported, including the British Aksakal at Yarkand.&apos; (d) Persian Gulf. The Sheikh of Bahrein has presented the political resident with a cheque for Rs. 30,000 for the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund, whichwas launched by the Political Resident last November and has met with an excellent response.  10,000 has already been remitted for the purchase of twofighters which are to be christened &quot; Bahrein &quot; and &quot; Koweit.&quot;21. Indian States.Reactions in the Indian States generally to the political situation in british india have so far been negligible. Communal tension is greater in Hyderabadthan elsewhere, but no serious disorders have recently occurred.The Rulers of Indian States continue to make notable contributions towardswar activities. The armed forces in India have been augmented by the provisionof 40 units of Indian State Forces. Of these the Bikaner Camel Corps and aKashmir Mountain Battery have proceeded on service overseas. Other units haverelieved British Indian troops in stations on the North-West Frontier and on internal security duty, including the guarding of Prisoners of War Camps inBritish India. Others are under training at stations in British India forembodiment in the Field Army. It is proposed to mechanise a Jodhpur cavalry regiment. Advantage has also already been taken of offers of workshops inHyderabad, Indore and Jodhpur for manufacture of ordnance stores and othermunitions of war, and the use of others is contemplated. Up to the end ofJanuary cash contributions for various war purposes had been received from indian States, including in this country the provision of aircraft and other warequipment and gifts to the Red Cross and St. John&apos;s and the Lord Mayor&apos;s air raid Distress Funds, to the order of one and a half million pounds sterling, and,in addition, three hundred thousand pounds sterling in the shape of annualcontributions.22. Economic.(a) Training of Indian workmen in England. -The scheme sponsored by theMinister of Labour to bring Indian workmen to this country for a six months&apos;course of training in engineering, the primary object of which is to acceleratemunitions production in India, has given great satisfaction among all classes inIndia, who regard it, apart from its practical benefits, as showing both imagina-tion and sympathy. There has been no lack of recruits, and the first batch of fifty sailed from India on the 17th February. They are expected to arrive in thiscountry towards the end of March. The Ministry of Labour have appointed aWelfare Officer, and are now preparing a hostel at Letchworth, where the traineesare to be accommodated for a time before being lodged with suitable Britishfamilies.(b) Eastern Group Supply Council-Sir Archibald Carter has arrived inIndia, and the representatives of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of SouthAfrica and their staff are on their way, and it is hoped that the Council will begin to function almost immediately.
It has been decided to utilise the Supply Council also for Naval and RoyalAir Force requirements in the East. In this connection an Admiralty adviser isbeing appointed to assist the Chairman of the Council in dealing with Navaldemands, and the Air Council have appointed to the Staff of the CentralProvision Office a R.A.F. officer, who will be charged with the duty ofco-ordinating Royal Air Force supply interests.(c) Coal for the Middle East. One result of the closing of the mediterranean to commerciai shipping has been that the countries of the Middle East have had to look to India and to South Africa for their coal supplies which normally were obtained from this country. During the past few months shipments of coal havebeen made from India on a large scale for Naval and Army requirements in theMiddle East, railway requirements in Palestine, Egypt and the Sudan, GreekGovernment requirements and for bunkering depots at Port Said, Port Sudanand Aden. With a view to preventing the large rise in prices which suchincreased demands would normally have entailed, the Government of Indiasuggested that all demands should be placed through them. A selection of themost suitable grade of coal is made in each case by their Chief Mining Engineer,who is also responsible for inspecting the coal before shipment.In order to cope with the demand for shipping entailed by this movement ofcoal, it was necessary to divert ten ships from the coasting trade, which is aserious matter during the busy season, and to facilitate this diversion theGovernment of India, in response to an appeal from the Ministry of Shipping,agreed to requisition four Indian registered ships in addition to four othersuch ships which they had requisitioned just previously for Middle Eastrequirements.(d) Groundnut Surplus. The closing of the continental markets has had amost serious effect upon India&apos;s trade in groundnuts. Practically the only outlet for her exportable surplus (amounting on an average to 1,000,000 tons a year) isto be found now in the purchases made by the Ministry of Food for this country.In August last the Ministry agreed to fix its purchasing price at  10 per ton.o.b. (which is below normal prices), but the volume of its purchases has not proved sufficient to maintain the internal market price at a comparable level, andthe rapid fall in prices during the present season has caused the Government ofIndia grave concern.A provisional arrangement has now been made, with the approval of theTreasury, by which the Ministry of Food will continue to buy from the shippersat  10 per ton f.o.b., and thus forgo the advantage of the abnormally low level towhich prices are falling, and the shippers will make a contribution to the Govern-ment of India equal to the difference between the market price and  10 per ton.This contribution will be used by the Government of India to encourage the localconsumption of groundnut oil and cake. A condition of the maintenance of theMinistry&apos;s price at the present level is that the Provincial and States Govern-ments most deeply interested (Madras, Bombay and Hyderabad) should makesimilar contributions to the same fund.23. Finance.Vesting of &quot; dated &quot; sterling loans. It was mentioned in the second reportfor February 1940 (W.P. (R) (40) 80) that a scheme had been initiated for there patriation of Indian sterling debt by means of the purchase in the london market of amounts of Indian sterling stocks. This reduction of the external debtis advantageous to India both financially and politically. The process has beenpursued to the utmost extent practicable, but in recent months the amountspurchasable in the market at a reasonable price had become very small, so thatthe practical operation of the process had come almost to a standstill.In these circumstances, the co-operation of the Treasury was secured in theuse of their special powers, which enabled them to requisition the holdings of suchstocks which were owned by persons resident in the United Kingdom, and to sellthem at the same price to the Government of India for cancellation. By Orderspassed on the 7th February they have requisitioned in this way the holdings ofthe stocks noted below, comprising all the India sterling stocks which have a fixed date of repayment. The Government of India has taken similar steps in respectof holdings of the same securities which are in the hands of residents in India;[22335] c
and opportunity is being given to holders resident elsewhere in the sterling area to tender their holdings voluntarily for acquisition at the same price :  Stock.5 per cent.. 1942-4744. per cent., 1950-554l per cent., 1958-684 per cent,, 1948-533  per cent., 1954-593 per cent., 1949-52Nominal Amountoutstanding inNovember 1940.  millions.5-4435-7015-699-668-808-34AcquisitionPrice.     s.104 16110 1112 17106 11102 1699 16d.610074283-63This operation is not only salutary from the standpoint of the reduction inIndians external debt, but it has another advantage as well. The large sterling balances whose existence makes the operation possible can to a great extent be invested only in short-term securities, earning very low rates of interest, and thus a considerable pecuniary advantage is secured by using them for the purchase and subsequent cancellation of medium- and long-term securities bearingsubstantially higher rates.From the standpoint of this country, or of general imperial interests, theoperation may be justified on broad grounds by the fact that the great plethoraof Indian sterling resources is integrally connected with India &apos;s co-operation inthe war effort, and that any resultant embarrassment cannot, therefore, beregarded as of purely domestic concern to India. Beyond this, however, there aretwo other considerations. First, the existence in the hands of the Indian autho-rities of such a great mass of sterling has tended to accentuate the Indian demandfor the acquisition of more gold, and there is hope that their utilisation for there patriation of sterling debt, which is generally popular in itself, may satisfysome of the critics, and cut the ground from under the feet of the remainder.Secondly, it is expected that a large proportion of those whose holdings arerequisitioned will use the proceeds for investment in defence bonds, or otherwar-time issues of the British Government.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.24. General.The internal situation continues to be peaceful. The tension between land-lords and tenants arising from a breakdown of the Tenancy Act last year haseased, and it is reported that amicable settlements of rents are nearly universal.Several persons have been interned under the Defence of Burma Rules forbeing implicated in a pro-Japanese plot, but as they were not prominent in public life, their arrests caused little interest. The Burma Communist party, a recentgrowth, has been proscribed as an unlawful association mainly on account of theissue of two subversive manifestoes. Three Burma-born Bengalis, who have beenendeavouring to stir up industrial strife, were arrested on the orders of theMinistry on the 1st March.Press and Public Opinion.The Burmese press views British shipping losses with concern, but hopes that effective counter-measures will be taken and that American aid will be forth-coming. The danger of Japanese air raids on Burma has been given prominence,and fears have been expressed regarding the repercussion on Burma of theJapanese-Vichy discussions on Indo-China.Nothing to report,25. Defence.
26. External Relations.A Chinese Military Mission arrived at Rangoon on the 20th February, andis touring the frontier in four groups.  No comment has been made in the press.27. Economic Relations.(a) Internal. Nothing to report.(b) External. Discussions on a trade agreement with India, which were opened at the beginning of February, were suspended until the first week of march to enable the Government of India to consult their unofficial advisers.During January, lorries leaving and entering Burma by the China Roadaveraged 164 outwards and 149 inwards per day. 11,000 tons were transported to china and 8,000 tons imported from China.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies inthe restricted sense, but also protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)28. Military Affairs.(a) United States Bases. *Settlement has been reached with the United States representatives on themajority of the clauses for inclusion in the agreement. The remainder are still under discussion. But it is clear that there is going to be very great difficultyin settling the clauses relating to the general rights of the United States in theleased areas and adjacent waters; defence, jurisdiction, and customs.The difficulties which have arisen in these discussions have been largely dueto the instructions issued to the United States delegates from Washington, which appear to have been formulated on the basis that the United States Bases are of paramount importance, and that the interests of the territories and theirinhabitants must be subordinated to them.(b) United States Naval and Military Observers.United States Naval Observers have been appointed in Ceylon, Fiji, north borneo, Sierra Leone and Singapore. A Military Observer is also being sent to singapore.(c) Far East.Further measures have been taken for the control of Japanese fishing vessels in Malayan waters.All ports in the State of North Borneo other than Sandakan and Jesseltonhave been closed to foreign shipping. This decision has led to a protest from theJapanese Government, and the policy is now being further considered in the lightof that protest. Meanwhile special permission has been given for two Japaneseships to call at one of the closed ports (Tawao) without prejudice to the ultimatedecision of policy.A Defence Force has recently been formed in Sarawak.(d) Ceylon.A Military Appreciation by the Commander-in-Chief, India, has now beenreceived, and is under consideration. The Colonial Office is taking up separatelythe question of the maintenance of adequate food reserves in the Island andcertain proposals for the reorganisation of the Ceylon Local Forces on a modern basis.[22335] D
(e) Coast Defences.In last month&apos;s report it was stated that the question of additional coast defences in Fiji and of coast defence in Tonga was under consideration. It hasnow been decided to allot two 6-inch Naval Guns to Fiji for the defence of theNavula passage, to be supplied from New Zealand. It has been decided that coast defence equipment for Tonga is not necessary.29. Disposal of Colonial Products.The recommendations which have now been submitted by the HighCommissioner for Palestine for assisting the Palestine citrus industry in thepresent crisis caused by the loss of practically the whole if its export markets arebeing discussed with the Treasury.The High Commissioner has recommended that assistance should take theform principally of advances to keep groves in cultivation, advances to help citrusgrowers to take up mixed farming and, in addition, relief work. The proposals would cost in the region of  1,100,000 in the first twelve months.30. Supplies to Colonies.The increasingly acute shortage of iron and steel supplies both in this countryand the United States has made it necessary to introduce a system of verymuch closer control of all such imports into the Colonies, and orders will in themain be centralised in future through the Colonial Office and the Iron and SteelControl, who will decide whether supplies can be furnished from this country or from the United States.Reports on Particular Colonies.31. Northern Rhodesia.The Report of the Commission which was appointed to enquire into the disturbances in the Copper Belt in April 1940, together with a statement by theGovernment of Northern Rhodesia on the action to be taken on the Commission&apos;recommendation, was published on the 18th February. Reference&apos;tqtlie/appoint-ment of the Commission was made in the Report for May 1940.The disturbances followed a strike by African workers in the Copper Mines;13 persons were killed and 69 wounded, of whom 4 died later.The Commission found that the action of the military in opening fire was forced upon them by the violence of the rioters themselves, and was necessary forthe protection of the compound officer and particularly the lives of those whohad sought safety within the compound. The firing was not continued for longer than was absolutely necessary in a very critical situation, and the force used didnot exceed that which the circumstances demanded.The Commission made a number of recommendations regarding wages andother conditions of employment of the African workers. As a result of negotia-tions between the Northern Rhodesia Government and the Mining Companies,most of these recommendations have been accepted and substantial increases in wages have been introduced.32. British Somaliland.In view of General wavell&apos;s continued successes in Africa, considerationhas been given to the administration of the Protectorate after its re-occupation.His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that the War Office must be responsiblefor the administration of occupied Italian territories under a system of militarygovernorships, and that at the outset the administration of British Somaliland,after its re-occupation, must be on a similar footing. As soon as the exigencies of the military situation permit, civil administration under the Colonial office will be re-established in the Protectorate in order to emphasise the differentstatus of that territory.
33. West Indian Labour for Munitions Industry.Some 48 Jamaican workmen have recently arrived in this country and arebeing employed in the Merseyside area. Some 69 more are on the point of arrival.Special arrangements are being made regarding their housing and welfare bythe Factories and Welfare Department of the Ministry of Labour.34. Ceylon.In connexion with the dispute between India and Ceylon regarding the rightsand privileges of Indians in Ceylon, the Governor, with my approval, has issued a statement of assurances and undertakings having current force which havebeen given to the Government of India in recent years by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the Ceylon Government, As the Ceylon Ministers have shown signsof wishing to go back on some of these undertakings, it was necessary to take this step in order to make clear to them the position of the Governor and of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the matter. The Ceylon Ministers have reactedunfavourably to this statement and are now proposing to introduce into the state council, at an early date, a new Immigration Bill to control future entry intoCeylon, which is likely to contain unacceptable provisions having a restrictiveeffect on the admission of &quot; non-Ceylonese &quot; to the island and their rights of citizenship.35. Hong Kong.Japanese military operations in the area round the northern border of HongKong are reported not to have been of a nature to indicate more than theirostensible object, i.e., the closing of this route for supplies to the ChineseGovernment.36. Malaya.The Legislatures of the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay states have both now passed legislation to introduce income&quot; tax for war revenuepurposes. The local Volunteer Forces have been called up for intensive combinedtraining over the period of February and March.37. Aden Protectorate.The Quteibi tribe, which had been causing serious trouble on the Aden-Dhalaroad, has now made complete submission to the Governor of Aden as a result ofair operations extending over several weeks, combined with political pressure inwhich the Aden authorities have received valuable help from the Sultan ofLahej.38. Palestine.There have been no political developments of importance during the month.The capture of Benghazi made a deep impression. While the general attitudeof the population to the war has not materially changed, German activity in the balkans has disquieted both the Arabs and the Jews. Despite the undoubteddesire of the Mufti to renew trouble and despite the circulation of rumours(mostly inspired), there are no indications of readiness on the part of the popula-tion to respond. Unexpected interest was shown, however, in the Iraq Cabinetchanges.There has been much internal Jewish political activity, mainly behind thescenes, directed towards the elimination of party differences, but with no tangibleresults.Recruiting for both Arab and Jewish Units of the armed forces has been steadily and satisfactorily maintained.Minor acts of brigandage and sabotage showed a slight increase during themonth, but there is no indication of political motive or organisation. resistance to outlaws and co-operation with the Police by villagers were again a satisfactoryfeature.  Numerous seizures of arms, accompanied by some arrests, were made.&apos;Transjordan remains normal.Great George Street, S.W. 1,March 19, 1941.
