(R) (*1) 53.A uaust 21, 1941.WAR CABINET.REPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF JULY 1941 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.GENERAL.(1) Far Eastern Situation.JULY was marked by growing tension in the Far East, which was intensifiedin the last week of the month by the Japanese occupation of bases in Indo-China.The Dominion Governments were kept continuously in touch with thesituation as it developed, and a series of exchanges took place with them both asto our general policy in the Far East and as to the specific counter-measuressuggested in. reply to the Japanese move.These exchanges disclosed a very full measure of agreement, both in principle and detail, between Dominion Governments and ourselves, enabling counter-measures on agreed lines to be imposed simultaneously throughout the Empire.These counter-measures took three forms :--(1) Special defence measures in Malaya and Hong Kong, the indirect effectof the Malayan measures being to reduce very substantially Japanesesupplies of iron ore.(2) The denunciation of the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911.Canada, as a party to the Treaty, concurred in this action, andassociated herself with it by giving notice of termination through theJapanese Minister at Ottawa and the Canadian Minister at Tokyo.The Trade Agreements of India and Burma with Japan weredenounced at the same time, and the New Zealand Governmentsimilarly took action through the Japanese Consul-General atWellington to denounce the New Zealand Trade Agreement with japan of 1928.(3) The freezing of Japanese assets. In this field the United Kingdom, afteradvance consultation with the Dominions, took parallel action withthe United States. Corresponding action followed at once in theDominions, and within 48 hours the freezing machinery was inoperation throughout the Empire. The freezing of Chinese assets,at the request of the Chinese Government, followed a few days later.Exchanges with Dominion Governments on this last head were complicated by doubts which at first arose as to the precise manner in which the United[22834] b51Printed for the War Cabinet.   A ugust 1941.
States Government intended to apply the Freezing Order in the United States.Clarification later received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washingtonenabled a detailed statement of policy to be drawn up here for recommendation to Dominion Governments, and further exchanges are proceeding in regard tothis statement. The general effect of the arrangements in view will be to paralyseJapan&apos;s trade with the Empire, exports to Japan only being permitted to theextent necessary to balance imports from Japan of essential importance to thepails of the Empire concerned.These counter-measures, while primarily economic in character, have raisedwide and far-reaching political issues. All the Dominions have stressed the greatimportance of keeping in line with, and going neither faster nor slower than, theUnited States. At the same time it has been generally felt, particularly by australia and New Zealand, that every effort should be made to obtain from theUnited States Government the clearest possible indication that in the event ofwar with Japan we could count without reservation on their armed support. Thebuilding up of a united front in the Far East, accompanied, or if necessarypreceded, by a strong warning to Japan, is the immediate objective round whichthe recent exchanges with Dominion Governments have turned, and the closestcontact is being maintained with them on this issue, with special reference tothe development of the Japanese menace to Thailand.CANADA.(2) General Position.The Canadian war effort continued to expand during July and no unduecriticism was expressed during the month. . Conscription is still a live issue.Despite the use which has been made by United States Isolationists of theCanadian Prime Ministers pronouncements against it, however, there is nothing to show that this question is coming to a head, and, in fact, the month saw theconclusion of a successful drive for 32,000 recruits to the Canadian Active ServiceForce. No labour strikes of consequence have occurred, and the Governmentssupport for the adoption of a cost of living bonus on all wages has received theapproval of virtually the whole of the press. The Government has also taken overall employment exchanges, but a suggestion for the mobilisation of labour on theUnited Kingdom model did not receive much support.Mr. Lapointe, Minister of Justice, and Colonel Ralston, Minister of Defence,spoke of Canada&apos;s industrial effort on the occasion of the completion of the first25-pounder gun in the Dominion. No criticism of the introduction of the schemefor the restriction of petrol has been expressed, and the prospect of rationing isbeing discussed. The only critical notes were struck by the Winnipeg Free Press,and some other newspapers, which suggested a Canadian Ministry of economic warfare, and by other interests which urged a larger propaganda service andan extension of the Canadian Ministry of Information.Canada has welcomed the many overt acts which show United States interestin the course of the war, and Mr. roosevelt&apos;s appeal to Congress to recognise the national emergency, the speeches of Colonel Knox, Mr. Willkie and others,and particularly the United States occupation of Iceland, were all noted with approval. Opinions on the implications of the last act varied considerably, butthere was common agreement that the truth remains that &quot; the British Empirefights alone.&quot;Canadian interest in the Western Hemisphere is shown by the appointmentof a Canadian Minister to Brazil and the Argentine, and of the sending of a trade Commission to Latin America. - -Canadian public opinion shows itself as solidly behind Mr. Churchill andthere was a general welcome for the changes in the United Kingdom Cabinetannounced during the month. The two Canadian Ministers, Mr. Mackenzie andMr. Power, on their return from their mission to England, praised British morale and organisation. Canada also expressed pleasure at the proposed visit of the duke of Kent.In the field of Empire relations Canadian opinion noted with interest theappointment of an Indian Agent-General in Washington. This move is regarded in many quarters as the first step towards the granting to India of full Dominion
status. There was a sympathetic reaction to Mr. Dillon&apos;s speech in the Dailurging the entry of Eire into the war, when Mr. de Valera&apos;s policy was described in terms &quot; some sorrowing, more bitter.&quot;Vichy stock is now falling very low among French-Canadians. A poll of723 to 17 in favour of De Gaulle among employees of the Quebec Power company is regarded as a correct indication of the general feeling. This shows a remark-able change from the Petain majority earlier in the year. There was considerable;inu;er at the enrolment of French volunteers to fight against Russia at the behestof the Germans, and the surrender of Indo-China led to a renewed demand forthe removal of the Vichy Minister in Ottawa. The end of the Syrian campaignwas hailed with relief, and the French press noted the confidence shown in theFree French by the British authorities in the handing over of the control of theadministration to General de Gaulle. So far, indeed, has opinion travelled, thatgreat indignation was shown at the announcement by Marshal Petain of a newFrench constitutional commission. Le Canada commented on this: &quot;Franceabolishes universal suffrage.&quot; And an editorial in Soleil quoted a letter from,unoccupied France to prove that the French clergy are not behind Vichy.The alliance with Russia was accepted much more easily by the Englishpress than by the French.There was general disappointment at the news of General WavelLs transfer from the command in the Middle East.(3) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Colonel K. S. Maclachan, Canadian Deputy Minister of Naval Affairs, andCommodore H. E. Reid, R.C.N., Canadian Deputy C.N.S., arrived in the UnitedKingdom during July for discussions with United Kingdom naval authorities.The Canadian Government have agreed to make available for operation inUnited Kingdom waters two minesweeper flotillas of eight vessels each, one inDecember 1941 and another early in 1942.Mr. Victor Sifton, Canadian Master General of Ordnance, also visited theUnited Kingdom to discuss ordnance questions.The Third Canadian Division (less one Brigade Group and Engineer Units)arrived in the United Kingdom during July. The Fourth Division is in Canada.The Fifth, now forming, is an Armoured Division. The Canadian Governmenthave announced the intention of forming a Sixth Division.Early in the month Mr. Mackenzie King reaffirmed the Government&apos;s pledgenot to introduce conscription for overseas services without going to the country.Subsequently it was announced that a two-months drive for Army recruiting(which for a time had hung fire), had produced 48,000 volunteers, of whom,however, 14,000 were rejected on medical grounds. The figure of 34,000 who were accepted compared with a target for the period of 32,000, and was thus consideredsatisfactory.  In future the monthly intake is intended to be about 7,000.Major Power, the Canadian Minister of National Defence for Air, the Chiefof the Canadian Air Staff, have returned to Canada, and also the Vice-Chiefof the General Staff, who had come to this country in June.In the course of discussions about the Empire Air Training Scheme, MajorPower explained that, although the Canadian Government were not pressing for R.C.A.F. formations to be used outside the United Kingdom, they would haveno objection to this provided that they were previously consulted.(4) Economic Activities.Nil.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.(5). General Position.&quot;At no time since its election has this Parliament less resembled ahinstrument of war.&quot;   This quotation from the Sydney Morning Herald sums upthe internal situation in Australia.   In fact, as the High Commissioner reports,there is now a widespread feeling that it is better to put Labour in power than[22834] B 2
to allow the Government to continue its &quot; precarious and humiliating existence.&quot;Mr. Menzies has been attacked personally for his failure to end this state ofaffairs, and it has been suggested that he should represent the commonwealth government in London. On the other hand, no alternative is suggested to him in any non-Labour Government, although one group of newspapers is nowsupporting the claims of Mr. Fadden. The month has also seen considerabledisturbances as a result of the entry of Russia into the war. Sir Ronald Cross,the newly-arrived High Commissioner, raised a mild storm by his comments topressmen on communism, in terms which were subsequently found to have been largely misunderstood. In New South Wales the continued internment of twoCommunists resulted in a one-day strike, in which, Mr. Menzies asserted, 50,000people joined.The war effort was impeded in another direction by the reckless use of petrol.One newspaper asserted that &quot; supplies are very greatly less than they were sixmonths ago,&quot; and stated that this drain was entirely due to the fact that it waspoured out in wasteful use. The uneasiness at such extravagance has naturallybeen increased by the possible dangers of a Japanese blockade. German com-muniques are said to have a large influence and it is asserted that it might benecessary to ban them altogether.The new appointments in the Middle East called forth a complaint about the lack of consultation with the Commonwealth Government, and the hope was expressed that Captain Lyttelton would not prove &quot; a political Commissar.&quot;There have also been complaints that Australians are not considered for thehighest appointments for the fighting services. The Catholic press have alsobeen making a series of attacks on Mr. Churchill, and on the alleged slackness,profiteering, and luxury in the United Kingdom.The Russian resistance to aggression has been greatly admired by all parties.The attitude to the Russian alliance has, however, varied. Extreme Catholicopinion is shown by a reference to the &quot; atheistical, criminal gang &quot; in power in moscow under the orders of Stalin, &quot; still public enemy No. 1.&quot; On the otherhand, the view of the greater part of Australian opinion is that &quot; the Russianpeople are fighting the same bush fire as we are.&quot;Australia continues to feel a certain uneasiness at the attitude of Japan,but the resolute Anglo-American countermoves to the occupation of Indo-China&apos;restored confidence. &apos;&apos; This time at least there has been no hesitation or weaknessin the diplomacy of democracy.&quot;AUSTRALIA.(6) Naval, Military anal Air Activities.The Commonwealth Government have offered to man three more destroyers.The Australian Minister for the Navy, Mr. Hughes, has announced that aVolunteer Naval Auxiliary Patrol for the whole of the Australian coast is to be recruited on an honorary basis.H.M.A.S. Sydney has been engaged in carrying two 6-inch guns andmountings and stores to Noumea.Vice-Admiral Sir Guv Rovle has succeeded Admiral Sir Ragnar Colvin as chief of the Naval Staff.The 21st and 25th Australian infantry brigades took a prominent part inthe fighting in Syria, operating principally in the coastal area, Australiancasualties in Syria have been announced as 236 killed, 1,049 wounded and287 missing.In order to improve the militia, and as a step towards providing rapidmobilisation in an emergency, a quarter of the Militia Forces are to be called upfor full-time service by the 1st October. The remainder are to have their training-brought up to six months.(7) Economic Activities.
(8) General Position.The Government introduced its budget in the course of the month. relief is expressed at the absence of increased taxation, but the press criticises theGovernment for the failure to reduce civil expenditure or to make larger warpayments. The)7 assert that its general effect is that of a peace budget with war expenditure merely tacked on, and that its result would be to place a fresh burden on the British taxpayer. The budget is thought to have been framed with aneve to the general election due at the end of the year.Mr. Fraser&apos;s activities in the United Kingdom have not called forthparticular comment. The first contact of the New Zealand public with actualwar casualties was on the arrival of a shipload of wounded from the middle east. New Zealanders were surprised by General WavelEs appointment to the command in India, since he was widely regarded as second only to Mr. Churchillamong the war leaders, and he enjoyed the complete confidence of all sections ofopinion.   The general verdict was that he &quot; needed a rest.&quot;The complacency already noted in regard to the war has been supported bythe news of the Russian resistance to the Germans. This, together with theBritish air effort, and the United States supply programme, have combined toproduce a feeling of security which was not shaken by reports of Japanese moves.There is general support for Russia, and a tendency to look beyond the war tothe chief obstacles of peace (first regarded as frontier problems about which itwould be necessary to make general agreements at once). Only the Catholics stoodout in opposition, and their criticism was even stronger than in Australia and canada. It may be summed up in the quotation from Zealandia.- &quot; To aid SovietRussia, even against our common foe, is inviting the curse of God upon ourselves.&quot;Emphasis tended, however, to shift from Russia to Japan as the monthwore on, and a strong protest was made at alleged British inability to see thatin Japan the army and big business were not so much rivals as complements.Nevertheless, war with Japan is discounted, the threatening Japanese moves beingconsidered to.be &quot; a war of nerves on a vast scale.&quot; Confidence still remains highin the deterrent power of the British and United States fleets.(9) Naval, Military and Air Activities.An Armoured Brigade is to be formed and trained in New Zealand with aview to despatch for service with the Expeditionary Force about the end ofMarch 1942.A Command and Staff School is being established.Brigadier Puttick has been appointed Chief of the General Staff on the retirement of Major-General Sir John Duigan.(10) Economic Activities.Nil.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.(11) General Position.The political parties in the Union are now busily preparing for theProvincial Council elections which were originally fixed for next February. Itmay be necessary, however, for &quot;these to be postponed until the five-yearly revisionof electoral districts, now being undertaken, is completed. Provisional returns of the new Voters Register have shown that the trek to the towns continues.Hitherto the towns have been the principal centres of British influence, but theinhabitants of the mining towns and villages along the Rand have tendedincreasingly to be Afrikaner in their politics.The principal subject uppermost in the public mind in the Union in thepast month was, however, the rising cost of living. The Opposition has madeas much capital as it could out of this, but the Government was attacked even
by English papers in Natal for failing to give a decisive lead m placing theUnions economy on a war basis. Fear of inflation is, in fact, being freelyexpressed in all quarters. The Durban Chamber of Commerce, in a memorandumrecently issued, have urged higher taxes and compulsory saving to counteract the prevailing tendency. This memorandum was supported by the Natal papers,which also demanded a Cabinet reshuffle, alleging that only three of the membersof the present Government are worthy of their rank. The Government are aware of the danger, and the Minister of Finance announced at Johannesburg on the29th July that the Government intends to embark on a new and vigorous campaign of price control. It also proposes to control profiteering, including both factory and wholesale prices, and the price of agricultural products after they have left the producer. Although fresh currency is being created, owing to the increasedprice of gold, the banks, are pursuing a cautious policy in regard to credit facilities. The excess supply of funds will also be utilised for the reduction of overseas debts, both private&quot; and public. New loans this year will be used notonly to finance the war, but also to redeem overseas securities as opportunity offers. The Minister called on private individuals to economise in the purchaseof imported goods, which will, in any case, probably be controlled, and he statedthat a Committee of economists and business men is being formed to advise theTreasury on the whole question.Comment on Imperial affairs was restricted. All the Government paperspaid a warm tribute to General Wavell; the Opposition press claimed that hisremoval was due to his &quot; failure&quot; against General Rommel. The press had little to say on the Cabinet changes in Great Britain, but much interest was shown inthe reports of the debate on the Ministry of Information. There was somecomplaint of the treatment of American press correspondents, particularly in theNear East. Opposition comment on Great Britain was less objective. It maybe summed up by two headlines selected at random from the Transvaaler :&quot; Churchill Gloats over Prospect of Merciless Revenge,&quot; and &quot; British Foodless than in 1917.&quot; Elsewhere, the Transvaaler protested against the treatmentof South African nationals refusing to take part in the war effort of SouthernRhodesia, although, in fact, the position of these people was regularized by anagreement between General Smuts and Sir Godfrey Huggins earlier in the year.The Opposition have made play with the occupation of Iceland by the UnitedStates by claiming that this was a first step towards the occupation of SouthAfrica.The main foreign vehicle for Opposition venom has been the Russian-german war, in which, by the end of the month, the Government papers were claiming that the Germans were &quot; floundering.&quot; The extremist point of view is perhapsbest summarised in the sentence from one of the Opposition newspapers : &quot; Thewar had now become a struggle between a Great Power which had incorporatedfive small countries and another Power which had destroyed the independence ofthree smaller countries.&quot; Even the Opposition has been impressed by russian resistance, although they have not ceased to make what capital they can out ofan alliance with &quot;Godless Communism.&quot; The Government press has been verycautious in its comments, and has made no editorial comment on the Anglo-Russian Agreement. Other agencies have not been so cautious, and an attempt by the Finnish consul to defend Finland&apos;s attitude as being one only of defence against Russia was sharply attacked by the South African Mine Workers&apos; Union.South African opinion on the struggle may perhaps best be summarised byGeneral Smuts&apos; statement that, &quot; If Hitler, in his megalomania, has driven russia to fighting in self-defence, we bless her arms and wish her all success withoutfor a moment identifying ourselves with her Communistic creed.&quot;There was little significant comment on other world events. All partiesacknowledged the importance of the recapture of Syria for the Allied cause.Japanese threats to Indo-China were noted.The &quot; V &quot; campaign is in full swing throughout the country.(12) Naval. Military and Air Activities.During July, the 2nd South African Division, less one Infantry Brigade andthree Field Regiments, arrived in Egypt. The remaining 8,000, which will complete the division, have left the Union and are due in Egypt in August.
Work on coastal fortifications at Walvis Bay, Saldanha Bay and RobbenIsland Harbour is proceeding.(13) Economic A activities.Nil.NEWFOUNDLAND.(14) General Position.Arrangements for establishing an Admiralty dockyard at St. John&apos;s andfor extending the facilities available there for repairing merchant vessels arebeinc actively pressed on. The Government of Newfoundland have also offered to establish a shore depot at St. John&apos;s for training Naval and Mercantile Marinerecruits and to bear a portion of the costs.The Government of Canada have appointed a High Commissioner in&apos;Newfoundland.(15) Naval, Military and A ir A activities.105 Naval recruits, 29 Royal Artillery recruits and 8 Royal Air Force GroundStaff are en route to the United Kingdom.(16) Economic Activities.224 loggers have arrived in this country and 177 are en route. These menare required to fill vacancies in the Newfoundland Forestry Unit, due to enlist-inent in one of the fighting Forces or to repatriation of time-expired men.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.(17) Naval, Military and Atr Activities.Nothing special to report.EIRE.(18) General Position.The principal event since last month&apos;s report has been the speech made byMr. J. M. Dillon, Deputy Leader under Mr. Cosgrave of the Fine Gael Party, inthe Dail on the 18th July. Mr. Dillon said that, although the Eire Govern-ment&apos;s policy of indifferent neutrality was the policy of the majority of thepeople, the policy of the elected Government and, he believed, the policysupported by the majority of his Party, it was not in the true interest, moral ormaterial, of the Irish people. When the choice lay between dishonour andmaterial ruin on the one hand, and the risk of war on the other, terrible as thatrisk might be, he thought a nation with the tradition of the Irish should facethat risk of war and refuse to submit to a blackmail of terror designed to make itsell its honour and stake its whole material future on the vain hope that it mightbe spared the passing pain of effort. He therefore said that the Dail should ascertain precisely what co-operation Great Britain and the United States might require to ensure success against the Nazi attempt at world conquest and asexpeditiously as possible afford that co-operation to the limit of their resources.They knew that on the side of the Allies was right and justice, and on the sideof the Axis was evil and injustice. It was fear of the German blitz that deterredthem. But the poor of Dublin would be starving in the winter if England didnot come to their rescue.Mr. Dillon&apos;s speech was a free-lance one and it is understood that it wasmade against the advice of his own Party. It was at once repudiated byMr. Cosgrave on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, and Mr. de Valera was also atpains to defend his own policy. The speech is nevertheless important as the firstinstance of outspoken support in Southern Ireland since the outbreak of the war for the British moral cause.
In their replies neither Mr. Cosgrave nor Mr. de Valera dealt withMr. Dillon&apos;s claim that the material as well as the moral interests of Eiredemanded co-operation with Great Britain and the United States. They dealtonly with the moral side. Mr. Cosgrave took the line that in this war all thevirtues were not on one side and all the sins and guilt on the other. It was theduty of every person in public life to secure the integrity of his country, and theopinion of the vast majority in Eire was that this was best served by a policy of neutrality. General Mulcahy, another member of the Eine Gael Party, saidthat, if they were to ask the people to declare war.on the Axis Powers, they wouldhave to put before them the full page of history from 1918. It was not easy,assuming that they left out the question of the guilt of Germany for the presentsituation, to say that the United States, France and Great Britain couldcompletely wash their hands of responsibility for the circumstances of europe to-day.Mr. de Valera was at pains to make clear that the attitude of his .Govera-ment was that any aggressor from any quarter whatever was going to be resisted.He betrayed considerable concern at the trend of American opinion against Eire,and claimed that Eire was not belligerently anti-American or belligerently anti-British. He thought it would be quite impossible for anybody to attempt to lead the Irish nation along the line suggested by Mr. Dillon. He referred to the factthat during the last war Great Britain had claimed to be fighting for the rightsof small nations, and at the same time had refused to give freedom to Ireland.Ireland had got that freedom now, but &quot; this part of Ireland did not representthe territory that they had been struggling to get possession of, and as long asthat wrong remained unrighted the people would not be convinced that it wasa war for freedom on one side and for slavery on the other.&quot;The other event of importance in Anglo-Irish relations since the last report was prepared has received less publicity. It concerns arrangements which havebeen made, after consideration by the Government here and discussion with the eire authorities, for the recruitment of Irish labourers for work in this country.It is estimated that the number involved may be of the order of 30,000, in additionto some 10.000-15.000 men whom it is proposed to import for agricultural workthis summer.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.(19) Political Situation.1. The Congress civil disobedience campaign, though not yet abandoned,seems to have passed its peak, and has now generally ceased to be a serious administrative problem. Some significant defections from the Party have helped to advertise the growing dissatisfaction with- the inability of Congi&apos;ess to dealwith the problems of communal tension or the growing threat of invasion.2.   No serious communal disturbances were reported throughout the month.3. In the political field the non-co-operative attitude of the major political parties is still maintained. In view of the continued failure of these parties andtheir leaders to respond to the Viceroy&apos;s proposals of the 8th August, 1940, HisMajesty&apos;s Government decided that progress on those proposals should no longerdepend on the association of political leaders, but should be undertaken forthwith,for the purpose of securing better administrative efficiency and the closer associa-tion of non-official Indian opinion in the war effort. Accordingly, on the22nd July the Viceroy announced (a) the expansion of his Executive Council bythe addition of five seats and the appointment thereto, as well as to two existingseats in which vacancies were impending, of seven prominent non-official Indiansnot closely associated with the major political parties, and (b) the establishmentof a National Defence Council of some 30 members, representative of theProvinces (including the Moslem Prime Ministers of the four Provinces in whichgovei&apos;nment by Ministers is maintained), the Indian States, Industry, commerce and other aspects of the national life concerned in the war effort, which will haveadvisory functions and will meet periodically for discussion under the presidency of the Viceroy.
Although, as was expected, dissatisfaction has been widely expressed inIndia that the action thus taken does not go far enough, while Mr. Jinnah is,.&apos;ered by the inclusion in the National Defence Council of the four MoslemPrime Ministers, which he regards as a move to split the Moslem League, thereis evidence that the changes have given some satisfaction and are appreciated as;; step to further progress in the direction of Dominion Status and as a contribu-; ion to the breaking of the internal political deadlock.4. There has&quot; been widespread condemnation of Germany&apos;s invasion ofRussia. This, however, has not been accompanied by any pronounced symapathy for Russia. Communist circles hope to make capital out of the situation, butHindu feeling generally is apathetic, and Moslems remember with bitterness thetreatment of their co-religionists in the Soviet Union. The Turco-german agreement was received with much misgiving, tempered with recognition ofTurkey&apos;s difficult position and a hope that it might postpone violation of her territory by Germany. It is too early to report reactions to the Japanese move in Indo-China.(20) Indian States.The reactions in the States to the general war situation are similar to thosein British India.The labour situation is generally more favourable, and measures have beentaken in Mysore and Travancore with the object of promoting better relationsbetween employers and workers.(21) Military Affairs.Further reinforcements have been sent to Iraq, including part of18th Infantry Brigade, the remainder of which will be sent early in August,thus completing two Divisions.His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreed to the despatch from India of anadditional brigade for Iraq, which will reach there soon after the middle ofAugust.The Government of India have agreed to maintain the Garrison Company inSeychelles for the duration of the war.The personnel for an Indian heavy A.A. Regiment have been sent to singapore.The Government of India have accepted responsibility for the provision ofsuch reinforcements as are required for Ceylon should any threat to the islanddevelop.(22) Foreign and Frontier Relations.1. Afghanistan.-- His Majesty&apos;s Governments relations with the AfghanGovernment seriously deteriorated during the month, as a result of the Afghanagreement to the appointment of Von Hentig as German Minister at Kabul.Von Hentig,,, who headed the German mission to Kabul during the last war, isan expert on the Middle East, and a thoroughly dangerous type.   Occasion wastaken to draw the Afghan Governments attention to his association with pro-Amanullah elements and to his intrigues in Syria with revolutionary Afghans,such as the Shami Pir and Adib Khan, but in spite of this and of his past recordthey accepted his appointment to Kabul without giving any notice of their intentions.   The British Minister made strong representations to the AfghanGovernment and to the Afghan Prime Minister personally about Von Hentig&apos;appointment.  At an interview on the 27th July Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytler informed the Prime Minister, on instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government, that theAfghan Governments action over Von Hentig, taken in conjunction with thepresence of a considerable number of Germans in key positions in Afghanistan,called in question our whole policy towards the Afghan Government, which had hitherto been based on friendly co-operation, and that if they persisted in accepting Von Hentig they could no longer expect to receive from us the samefacilities or assistance as had been rendered to them in the past.   The PrimeMinister took the line that the matter was one of internal Afghan policy onwhich he could not accept dictation; and in view of his attitude it was decidedas a first step to adopt the policy of imposing gradual economic sanctions in afghanistan; Russian co-operation in this policy was invited.[22834] c
Sir K. Fraser-Tytler has since, however, reported that he has been informed by the Foreign Minister that, as the result of representations made by him to theGerman Minister, Von Hentig will not after all be coming to Kabul. Sir K.Fraser-Tytler took the opportunity to press again for the removal of the Germansemployed&apos; in Afghanistan. The Foreign Minister, though stressing the necessityfor proceeding cautiously with the Germans, promised that he would consider thequestion of getting rid of some of them. His attitude was generally satisfactory,and he affirmed his belief in the British connexion as the only hope for Afghanprosperity. Sir K. Fraser-Tytler suggests that, as Von Hentig is not now tocome to Kabul, the matter should be allowed to rest until his own successor has arrived in Kabul and has had time to consider the position. He could then proceed, in collaboration with the Russians, to maintain pressure on the AfghanGovernment for the removal of the greater part of the German Colony.The Afghan Government have given their agreement to the appointment ofSir Francis Wylie as His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul in succession to Sir K.Fraser-Tytler.Although it is not yet possible to estimate Afghan opinion exactly, theBritish Minister thinks that the recent doubtful attitude of Turkey towards theGerman invasion of Afghanistan&apos;s arch enemy, Russia, has tended to increasepro-German sympathy amongst the Afghan official classes.Afghan opinion generally remains strongly anti-Russian; but the failureof the Germans to break through is having some effect, and the decision of theGerman Government not to send Von Hentig to Kabul will probably improve thesituation. Russo-British pressure on Iran to remove Germans is being carefully-watched, and there is considerable apprehension in official circles as to thepossibility of similar pressure being exerted in Afghanistan also, which mighthave the effect of promoting a serious internal crisis. But up to now the country generally is quiet.2. North-West Frontie?[,-In North Waziristan military operations to dealwith the Madda Khel situation were continued and the punitive destruction ofcertain hostile villages in this area has been carried out. Our latest information is that Madda Khel and Manzar Khel jirgas were interviewed on the 20th Julywith satisfactory results, but details have not yet been received.South Waziristan has remained quiet with the exception of one isolatedattack on a Government lorry on the 6th July.The Faqir of Ipi. who moved during the month to Kharre (north of MaddaKhel country) where he still is, is reported to have lost prestige lately and to be receiving little support in spite of strenuous efforts to mobilise the tribesmen.His requests to the Mahsuds for help have so far met with little response.The remainder of the frontier is quiet. The Russo-German war hasdistracted attention from the Turco-German Agreement. Anti-Soviet feeling-is strong, but the fact that Russia and Great Britain are now fighting againstthe same enemy does not appear to have led to an increase of anti-British feeling.The tribal mind is probably inclined to regard the Russo-German war as aseparate conflict.(23) Economic.1. Lndo-J apanese Trade. In accordance with the decision of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that it would be desirable so far as possible to match any restrictions imposed by the United States on their trade with Japan with comparablerestrictions on trade between Japan and the Empire, the Government of Indiaagreed to freeze all Japanese assets in India and in the first instance at anyrate to grant no licences under their freezing notification. Chinese assets inIndia were also frozen as in the rest of the Empire at the request of theChinese Government in order that their interests may be protected.The degree of tightness with which the freezing of Japanese assets shouldbe administered is at present under discussion with the United States Governmentand the Empire Governments, but it seems likely that very little further trade will be possible or indeed desirable. This will mean the virtual cutting off ofIndian imports valued at over  14 million per annum (forming 38 per cent, of japan&apos;s exports to the Empire). Raw cotton is India&apos;s principal export to japan, which has been taking recently about one-third of India&apos;s total exportsof this commodity.   Future exports depend to some extent on the policy of the
United States Government regarding exports of raw cotton from the UnitedStates to Japan. All India&apos;s other exports to Japan, in particular pig iron,manganese ore and mica, very reduced quantities of which have been allowedto be exported to Japan in accordance with the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, will now certainly cease.2. Indian Purchases in United States. On the advice of the british supply Council in North America, arrangements have now been made for the setting up of a properly constituted Indian Supply Mission in the United States.The Government of India have selected Sir Shanmukhan Chetty, former Presidentof the Indian Legislative Assembly, as Head of the Mission, and he is nowen route by air to America. The Mission will deal with all matters connectedwith the procurement of supplies for India, including transfers under the lease/Lend Act. In all matters it will work in the closest co-operation with theBritish supply organisations in America.3. Trend of Trade and Prices. The Indian economic position, as shown by its foreign trade and price statistics, has been well maintained during thesecond year of the war. The total exports in the year ending March 1941 were about  22 million better than in the last pre-war year, while imports showed a small increase of about  3-^ million; so that more than  18 million have been added to an already favourable balance of nearly  22 million.The losses of export markets in Europe were more than made good by increased exports to the United Kingdom, America and China. Imports fromthe United Kingdom fell by about 20 per cent., mainly owing to shipping difficulties; but this fall and the loss of the European sources of supply weremade good by increased imports from other Empire countries, the United Statesand Japan.There was an important change in the character of India&apos;s exports,manufactured articles increasing greatly in value and volume, while at the sametime the exports of raw materials, which bulk so largely in India&apos;s normal trade,have suffered severely from the loss of markets, net losses to the following extenthaving resulted (on a quantitative basis) : raw jute 66 per cent.; coffee 68 percent.; oil-cakes 56 per cent.; groundnuts 53 per cent.; mica 37 per cent.; rawwool 34 per cent.; raw cotton 20 per cent.; raw hides and skins 19 per cent.; andlinseed 13 per cent.After some fairly considerable fluctuations the prices of Indian primarycommodities settled down towards the end of the year 1940-41 at about 15 perrent, above the low pre-war level; and during the past two months there has beena steady improvement to about 33 per cent, above it. On the other hand, import prices have, in comparison, been at a higher level throughout the year.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.(24) General.The country is generally quiet.The Premier, for reasons mainly related to his Parliamentary position, askedfor a postponement of the session of the Legislature, which was convened forthe 4th August, and the Governor agreed.(25) Defence.Defence exercises were carried out on four days during the month with success and received a good press (which was not unduly alarmed).Approval has been given to the reorganisation of the military Command inview of the large increase of the Forces in Burma and the growing responsibilities of the Command. Lieutenant-General McLeod remains the General OfficerCommanding in Burma, but now has under him a Major-General in command of the forces in the field.[22834]
Action has been taken to freeze Japanese and Chinese assets in conformitywith His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy, though Ministers are concerned as tothe economic and financial consequences. In particular, anxiety is felt lest a collapse in prices, particularly of rice, which would contribute largely towardsinternal unrest, may ensue. This year&apos;s exportable surplus is mostly in thehands of dealers, but dealing in the new crops will begin in the last quarter ofthis year.During June 7,899 tons of petrol and 7,501 tons of other goods weretransported into China for the Chinese Government by the Burma Road. Dumpsin China between Wanting and Paoshan are reported overcrowded, particularly with heavy stocks of petrol.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &apos;&apos; Colonial Governors &apos;&apos; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)(27) Economic Affairs.(1) Supply of Colonial requirements from the United States.The Head of the Economic Department of the Colonial Office has arrived in Washington and is engaged on discussions with the American authorities andthe British Purchasing Commission.(2) Japan.In common with other Empire Governments, Colonial Governments havetaken part in the recent economic measures against Japan, and in particularsteps have been taken to freeze Japanese assets and (at the request of theChungking Government) Chinese assets.(3) Coffee.Proposals have now been received from Washington as to the second year&apos;imports under the quota scheme. They have been communicated to the east african Governors&apos; Conference, and appear to give East Africa and the othercoffee-producing Colonies a reasonable share of the United States market.(4) Sisal.Discussions are continuing between representatives of the Colonial Office andthe appropriate department in Washington for the acquisition by the UnitedStates of 40,000 tons of sisal for a reserve stock to be held either in East Africaor America.Reports on Particular Colonies.(28) Palestine.The successful termination of hostilities in Syria has been welcomed by theArabs, who had become critical of the Allies&apos; ability to force a decision beforethe Axis intervened. The terms of settlement have been generally approved bythe Arabs, and the main interest centres on whether political developments onthe lines promised by the Allies will materialise reasonably soon. There is ageneral feeling that, if this is left to the Free French, the Syrians will be no betteroff than before. It is said openly that the ultimate responsibility for the fulfilment of pledges rests with Great Britain.The major question of concern to the Jews during the month has beenGovernments proposal to introduce legislation to deal with labour disputesduring the war. The proposal produced considerable opposition, so farmanifested only in words.  A general strike has been threatened.
There has been a serious renewal of terrorist activity by Irgun Tsayai Leumi,the Jewish extremist organisation, mainly in the Tel Aviv area. It is directed against Jews, the object being extortion of funds for party purposes.Revisionists&apos; organisations are being carefully watched.There has also been a marked increase in individual acts of violence by persons carrying arms. There is no sign, however, that Arab lawlessness is organised, and a contributory factor is the availability of arms and ammunitionfrom the battlefields of Syria. The amount of arms so far brought to palestine is not sufficient to constitute a serious menace, and seizures of illegal arms continuesatisfactorily.(29) Malta.An important convoy reached Malta during the month. Its arrival was followed on the night of the 25th/26th July by an attack on Valetta harbour by italian E-boats and small torpedo-carrying craft. The attack was repulsedmainly by fire from the Harbour Defence batteries, principally manned by Maltesetroops. I have sent a message to the Governor of Malta congratulating these troops on the prominent part which they played in this successful action.June was a quiet month as regards air raids, but there was greater activityduring July. Demolition and clearance work resulting from damage done by air raids is being undertaken as rapidly as possible, and proposals for extending this work have recently been received from the Governor. sA scheme for compensation for personal injuries resulting from the war hasnow been published in Malta.(30) Gibraltar.The evacuation of all the civil population, who can be spared at this stage,has now been completed.(31) Cyprus.There have been a number of air raids by Italian aircraft over Cyprus duringthe month of July. The main objectives were the aerodrome at Nicosia and the harbour at Famagusta. Damage and casualties have been slight. But civilianlabour for the Nicosia aerodrome has become difficult to obtain. The governor has been authorised to obtain labour for essential works, if necessary, by com-pulsion; and similarly to use overriding powers to settle strikes, which have beenimpeding defence works to some extent. The conclusion of the Anglo-RussianAgreement has been followed by an intimation from the Labour Leaders in Cyprusthat they now wish to co-operate with the Government and to adopt peacefulmethods for settling differences.The general spirit of the people has shown some improvement and theoccupation of Syria had a heartening effect. Attention in the island is anxiouslyfocussed on the Russian Campaign.Early in July it was reported that some 900 Cypriots were missing as aresult of the campaign in Greece, and it has since become known that about one-quarter of the total strength of Cypriot units enlisted for foreign service is missing in Greece or Crete. This, coupled with seasonal factors, has broughtrecruitment for the Cyprus Regiment practically to a standstill.(32) Mauritius.Contributions to the Mauritius &quot; Spitfire Fund &quot; have now reached thefigure of  50,000.(33) Aden Protectorate.As the occupant of Dar-el-Beidha on the Aden-Yemeni frontier failed tomake his submission, his tower was, after due warning, demolished by the RoyalAir Force. No tribal repercussions followed, and no further attempts have beenmade by the Yemeni authorities to press their untenable claim that the place wasnot within the British Protectorate.
(34) Hong Kong.Some labour unrest culminated in a fairly extensive strike at the Taikoodockyard, which was attributed to intimidation on the part of a well-knownagitator employee of the yard. After the arrest and expulsion from the Colonyof this man and his principal lieutenant, work was resumed at the dockyard.As counter-measures to the Japanese move into Indo-China, the Commander-in-chief, Far East, has proposed the refusal of entry and departure to and fromthe port of Hong Kong to all non-British and non-Allied shipping during nighthours, and to compel such ships to berth in one particular part of the port toensure surveillance. Similarly, it is proposed to increase restrictions on the granting of transit and residential passport visas. These measures are under active consideration.(35) Malaya.As a defence measure, restrictions have already been placed on the night-timemovements of Japanese shijDs and lighters engaged in the iron ore trade on theeast coast of Malaya. As counter-measures against Japanese action in SouthIndo-China, the removal of Japanese residents from Defence areas in NorthernMalaya and in Johore (in the neighbourhood of the Naval Base) has been recommended by the Commander-in-chief. Far East.Censorship of correspondence has shown that the Chinese Consul at Penanghas been establishing contacts with the authorities in Japanese-occupied China,and the Chinese Government is being consulted as to his removal from Malaya.A Soviet Government representative is being sent to Singapore to keep inclose touch with local authorities on all matters relating to supplies for Russia.(36) Ceylon.The War Purposes Fund has now reached Rs. 2,400,000.The question of the reform of the Ceylon Constitution has again becomeactive. The Governor telegraphed at the end of June to say that the political position in Ceylon was deteriorating, and that the members of the State council had become stale and indolent. The Governor considers that agreement betweenthe Sinhalese and the minority communities will probably be impossible to achieveeither by a Commission sent to Ceylon or by a conference held in this country; andthat the solution must probably be an award by His Majesty&apos;s Government, whichwill not be satisfactory to any section, but which will be accepted as the best thatany can expect. The Governor had been told in the latter part of last year thatthe despatch of a Commission to Ceylon in war-time could not be arranged, andhe has therefore suggested that a new draft Order in Council based on his recom-mendations for reform should now be prepared for consideration by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. This, he thinks, will show that the war was not being made a pretext for deferring reforms.I have replied that, while I am anxious to pursue the reform of the Consti-tution  is soon as possible, I doubt whether ii is advisable to proceed in war-time with changes which may create effects more damaging in Ceylon than the defectsat present apparent; that before taking any action which would bring the questionof reforms into immediate prominence and which would be likely to stir up strongcommunal feeling, His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to be satisfied that changes, to which substantial minority communities strongly object, are, never-theless, urgently necessary in Ceylon in the face of Avar conditions. The reformsproposed by the Governor would be strongly opposed by the minority communities,and would not in my opinion pass this test. I have therefore repeated to theGovernor the suggestion that a statement should be issued in the sense that, whileHis Majesty&apos;s Government wishes to promote the reform of the Constitution assoon as possible and will take measures to that end as soon as circumstances permit, it is not possible in present conditions to decide upon the precise reformsto be effected.
(37) Sierra Leone.The Coaling Company labour dispute was settled on the 21st June inconsequence of an award by an Arbitration Tribunal. Labour returned to workon new conditions on the 22nd June, and there has been no trouble of any kindsince then. A Labour Advisory Board, with representatives of employers andemployed, is being constituted.(38) Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.The machinery for consultation between the Territories of Nyasaland,Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia (which provided for occasionalconferences of Governors and a standing committee on migrant labour) has beenenlarged in scope. For the pui&apos;pose of securing the more effective co-ordinationof the war effort of the three Territories, approval has been given for theestablishment, as a temporary measure, of a standing inter-territorial conference with a secretariat and ancillary services at Salisbury. The position is to be reviewed after the war. The existing contacts between Nyasaland and northern rhodesia on the one hand and the East x\african Dependencies on the other areto be maintained.
