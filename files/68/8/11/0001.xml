THIS DOCUMENT lS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)RET, No.,p.   (R)   (hO)   11    &quot;11 th February, 13h\^WAR CABINET^Economic Warfare^I attach, for the information of my colleagues,  a briefReport for the month of January, ISM .3th February, 1941.

Economic Warfare during January, 19h/l.There were no important developments in economic warfareduring January,  though some progress was made in tidying up trade agreements and rationing schemes with the remaining adjacentneutrals.     Further tightening of the blockade now chiefly depends on American decisions .which have been held up during the passage5f the Lease and Lend Bill.Although 10 French vessels were detained at Gibraltar duringthe month, the inward movement of 1h7,000 tons was slightly higherthen in December;      the outward,  at 163,000 tons, was slightly lower.     The French have now established regular steamship services between Marseilles and (1) the Antilles, with transhipment toBaltimore and New York, (2) Inde-Chiria, and (3) Morocco, Senegal,Guinea, Dahomey and the Ivory coast.       Up to the present, Americanexports have not arrived in the Antilles in large quantities forreshipment to France,     The detention of the s.s. Mendoza appearsto have caused the other French vessels which were ready to sailfrom the Plate to postpone their departure.It has been necessary to refuse navicerts for edible oils forSDf-in as a part of her own olive oil crop is to be sold to Italyand Germany:     hut the Spanish Government have now agreed thatcopper and cocoa may not he exported or re-exported from,  ortransported through Spain,His Majesty&apos;s Representative&apos;s personal approach to Dr.Salazar,end our willingness to rely upon his personal assurances, appear tohave brought us within sight of a final settlement of questionsoutstanding with Portugal and there are hopes that a war trade agreement may shortly he reached.Little progress has been made in negotiations with the Swiss.I But the lack of shipping and the closing of the port, of Genoa toI foreign vessels has, in any case, reduced Swiss seaborne importsnegligible amounts-  Minor concessions designed to speed updeliveries have been made to Yugoslavia along lines indicated byI &amp;hf Yugoslav General Staff and in cooperation with the Military^Attache in Belgrade.Navicerts and certificates of origin will shortly be required the Persian Gulf, details having been worked out to controlrfw^traband trade throu^b. Iran end Iraq. The Navy appears to haveinterfered successfully with an increasing contraband trade acrossIftip Red Sea into Eritrea.Good progress has been made in the negotiations with theherlands Government who, despite the delicate state of theirotiations with Japan, have refused to allow certain exports the Netherlands East Indies which were suspected to be forexport to the enemy and have agreed to institute a generaltrol of Netherlands East Indies exjports to be operated inraony with our export licensing arrangements.At the beginning of January, the United States placed copper,pa, zinc, nickel and potash on the Export Licensing List but,[spite of this good start, the month has been one of promisepout performance.     Procrastination in Washington in carrying outpposals, some of which were actually made to us by the Administra-jp, is now becoming serious.     It has characterised our negotia-gps not only about financial and shipping control, but also inlard to export licensing.     In particular, the United Statesipnistration haB shown reluctance to curtail their trade with*S.S.R. despite the evidence which we have adduced that thej^t are importing war commodities from the United States of^ica to replace domestic supplies which they are exporting toGermany,
Germeny. (M ore recently there has &quot;been an improvement in theUnited States attitude).As   our methods of indirect control &quot;become better known tothe enemy and to unfriendly neutrals, there is an increasingdanger that they will bo able to devise methods to contravertthem.      It now seems possible that a Pacific Club, designed tosupply Japan and Russia, may be  organised to compete with our ships Warrant Scheme:      and the loyalty of those American firms who have voluntarily entered into agreements with us not toparticipate in dangerous trade is heavily strained when thebusiness is passed to their competitors.In the absence of even tacit consent from Washington, wehave been reluctant to press for contraband control in the carribbean ana, in spite of several reports from the C.I.C.,American and West Indies Station, that uncertified items of cargo are being over-stowed in ships from Lisbon, we have been unable to ask for hold-back guarantees in the United States qsHis Majesty&apos;s Representative, Washington is unable to guarantee that these would be respected.In regard to enemy exports, the State   Departments attitthas been definitely unhelpful and there appears to be no realisof the importance to the blockade and to our whole war effortstopping the trade &quot;between Germany and South America.The position has been put frankly to Mr, Hopkins and it m&quot;be hoped that on his return to Washington, he may be able to reinforce the efforts which Lord Halifax has been making tosecure greater cooperation over the whole field of our economiwarfare activities.
