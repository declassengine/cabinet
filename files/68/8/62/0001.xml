Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.SECRET. Copy No. 49W.P. (R) (41) 62.October 20, 1941.WAR CABINET.REPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 1941 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated   TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.(1) General Position.DURING the month public opinion in Canada has naturally been exercisedwith the fortunes of war on the Russian front. After earlier determinedoptimism, a disquieting note appeared in press comments on the Russo-german war, in spite of copious references to German losses and difficulties, and to the reported disaffection in occupied countries. There was fairly widespread disappointment -pointment that Britain had not so far felt able to conduct any large military operation to help the Russians. The Toronto Star, for instance, continued to urge a further campaign in Libya.Unrest in France has been constantly reported, and the Free French Move-ment is gaining ground in Canada, mainly through the activities of M. HenriTorres, a French lawyer, now living in New York. There has been a continuingdecline in whatever prestige the Vichy Government ever held, even among French-speaking Canadians. The Vancouver Province represented the Vichy Govern-ment as forced to obey Hitler because it dared not face the French people. Theretention of the Vichy Minister in Ottawa aroused practically unanimousdisapproval in the Canadian press, and was actually welcomed only by Devoir,the ultra-Catholic paper.The attempted revolt in Argentina was regarded as evidence of Fifth Columnactivity in South America. Events in Persia have evoked little notice. TheAmerican Legion&apos;s support of President Roosevelt&apos;s policy has been enthusias-tically noticed.  The Spitzbergen raid was &quot; big news.&quot;In domestic affairs, certain sections of the press have exhibited some nervous-ness over Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s recent appeal at the Mansion House for american help. &quot; We know that our neighbours do not take more kindly to being told by us any more than by people elsewhere what is their duty in international affairs.&quot;Conscription, rationing and labour control have been frequently discussed in the press, and the Canadian Cabinet has adopted regulations making strikes in war factories illegal unless these are voted at a poll held under the supervision of the Department of Labour.The meetings of the Inter-Allied Council aroused little interest in theCanadian press; on the other hand, the Australian plan for compulsory loanscaused a mild sensation, and it was pointed out that these loans constituted a post-war insurance and that the example would not be followed in Canada, wherevoluntary loans had been extensive.The visit of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for DominionAffairs has evoked favourable comment from the press, and has led to editorial[23036] B
speculation on the difficulties which will arise when the time comes for evacueechildren to return to this country.The T.U.C.-Moore-Brabazon incident was inconspicuously reported, but was followed by claims in Devoir that Communism was gaining ground in both thiscountry and Canada. Mr. Bevin&apos;s Labour Day speech provided material forhomilies to Canadian labour.(2) Naval, Military and A ir A activities.H.M. Canadian corvette Levis was torpedoed on the 19th of September offGreenland while protecting an eastward-bound convoy and sank while in towlater the same day. 17 Canadian naval ratings and 1 English naval rating were killed.The 7th Infantry Brigade of the 3rd Canadian Division arrived early inthe month. The Royal Winnipeg Rifles of the same division arrived on the 13th,thus completing this division.The last detachments of the Spitzbergen expedition rejoined the 1st CanadionDivision during the week ending 13th September.The Canadian Corps took part in the G.H.Q. two-sided exercise betweenthe Southern and Eastern armies which began on the 26th September and finishedon the 5th October.The Canadian Army Tank Brigade on the 25th attended a demonstration of Churchill and Matilda tanks crossing McNaughton tube obstacles.Various units have been giving help to local farmers in harvesting theircrops.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.(3) General Position.After little more than a month in office, the Government formed byMr. Fadden, following on Mr. Menzies&apos; resignation, was defeated by three voteson an Opposition vote of censure on the Budget, on the 3rd October. The ground of the attack was that the national contribution scheme contained in the Budgetinvolved &apos;&apos; inequitable distribution of the national burden &apos;&apos; and that the Govern-ment proposal to defer increases in service pay until the end of the war was opposed to Labour policy. In connection with the first point, the Sydney MorningHerald called attention to the fact that bank credits have already been exploited tothe limit of safety, and pointed out that the Commonwealth is devoting less than25 per cent, of the national income to the war effort,as against nearly 75 per cent,in Britain.Mr. Fadden resigned and Mr Curtin was thereupon called upon to form a labour Government. Mr. Curtin stated that the neAv Government would co-operate heartily in the war, &quot; in which the interests of Labour were involvedmore than those of any other class.&quot;Before the Budget aroused so much opposition, a political scandal threatened to unseat both Mr. Fadden and his Government. The Prime Minister&apos;s personalpublicity officer had communicated confidential Government documents to the leader of the Opposition, Mr. Curtin, who promptly returned them to Mr. Fadden.It is understood that the papers related to a small and relatively unimportantsecret fund for anti-Communist propaganda in the trades unions, and also seemedto suggest that the Prime Minister had divulged his budget proposals beforehandto certain interests, and manipulated petrol rationing for the benefit of his con-stituency. Mr. Menzies&apos; name was deliberately involved, on the ground that theguilty officer was originally employed by him, and Mr. Menzies was sufficientlydisturbed by the onslaught to refer to it as a move to drive him out of public life.The Opposition vote of censure on the secret fund aspect was defeated by one voteonly, and no reference was made in the House to the question of budget revela-tions, while Mr. Menzies&apos; personal explanation was accepted in all quarters ofthe House. *There has been some criticism of the choice of Sir Earle Page as the Ministerto be sent to London, and this appointment was thought to be largely a politicalmanoeuvre designed to discredit Mr. Menzies, but one from which nothing was expected.
The public is becoming increasingly worked up over the question of help for russia, and is putting pressure on the Commonwealth Government to do somethingthemselves about it. There is even a body of thoughtful opinion which is turningtowards compulsory overseas service. In general, press comment on currentphases of the titanic struggle in Russia follows the usual lines in the UnitedKingdom press, though the Director of Recruiting has accused the bulk of theAustralian people of being &apos;&apos; blandly indifferent&apos;&apos; to the war.The Sydney Morning Herald of the 23rd September, commenting on reportedlethargy in the United Kingdom High Command and the United Kingdom public generally, said : &apos;&apos; We in Australia, with our interminable political strife and repeated strikes in war industry, have scanty reason to ask why Britain cannot do more.&quot;The Commonwealth War bill in 1941 will require a minimum amount ofA 225 million.The choice of the Commonwealth official representative in Malaya has been criticised on the ground that the circumstances warranted the appointment of arepresentative of Cabinet rank, trade considerations at present being subordinate.(4) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Two fleet minesAveepers and four auxiliary minesweepers were commissionedbetween the 30th August and the 24th September.Major-General S. F. Rowell, C.B.E., took up appointment as Deputy Chiefof the General Staff, the 1st September, vice Major-General J. Northcott, C.B.,M.V.O., who assumed command of the 1st Armoured Division of the AustralianImperial Forces on the same date.Eleven thousand A.I.F. personnel (non-divisional and reinforcements)arrived in the Middle East in September.One additional Field Artillery Battalion and two additional infantry battalions are to be raised so that units at tropical home stations may have12 months in a temperate region after 12 months in the tropics.Home Security.&quot; Blackout &quot; tests have been carried out in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.A Conference of Fire Fighting representatives has been held with the objectof standardising types of equipment. Issues of steel helmets to A.R.P. personnelhave begun.NEW ZEALAND.(5) General Position.In connexion with the recent Australian move towards representation inthe United Kingdom War Cabinet, the Prime Minister has stated that &quot; theplace of the Prime Minister of New Zealand is in New Zealand,&quot; but he wouldbe prepared to co-operate in any suitable plan for Dominion representation inthe Empire&apos;s War Council, whether by means of a Commonwealth war conference or by more adequate representation in London. In this connexion,local press comment was that &quot; most New Zealanders would nevertheless have felt reassured as to the presentation of general New Zealand strategical interestsif Mr. Menzies had joined the War Cabinet.&quot; Mr. Fraser, on his return to new Zealand, paid a tribute to the efficient working of the United KingdomWar Cabinet.Complacency and optimism about the war still reign, especially in the south,but press reaction was favourable to the United Kingdom ITigh Commissioner^warnings that a much greater war effort was needed. There is still littleappreciation of the proportions of the supply problems.The press comments on the Russian war have at length become graver intone, and criticisms in the United Kingdom press of the extent of the Britishsupport to Russia have been quoted. The Auckland Herald thought that theR.A.F. is not yet sufficiently superior in the west to give the necessary support to a continental invasion. The Evening Post saw in Mr. Matsuoka&apos;s recent speecha re-awakening of Japanese pro-Axis elements, and discussed his hope that russia will make a separate peace. At the same time, Press was inclined to linkthe reported Netherlands East Indies&apos; requests for assurances of help from the[23036] B 2
United Kingdom with the latter&apos;s alleged belief in the possibility of a compromise-mise settlement with Japan. The United States/Japan talks were prominentlyreported.   The Atlantic Declaration also received much prominence.The Labour Standard of the 4th September referred to the Washington&apos;&apos; revelation &apos;&apos; by the Prime Minister of New Zealand of the arrangements forthe United States to use Australian and New Zealand bases in the event of warwith Japan.The United Kingdom received some criticism in messages from Londonreporting public doubts as to the efficiency of United Kingdom industrial organisation, and attention has been drawn to the Royal Institute of Inter-national Affairs&apos; view that it can be carried much further without serious hard-ship. The delay in sending the Moscow Mission, ineffective use of man-power,arid the statement of the Chairman of the Engineering Industrial Associationthat war production in his line has declined were noted.Attention has been drawn to the increased strength of the British forces inthe Middle East.A threat of a coal-mining strike on account of the cost of living was avertedby the Governments appeal to the miners&apos; patriotism.The need to restrict the import of goods in short supply is reluctantlyadmitted. Much satisfaction has been expressed over the improvement in the shipments of New Zealand produce to the United Kingdom.The  10 million Government loan was over-subscribed.A Government Bill abolishing the death penalty for murdeE has passed theHouse of Representatives.A War Damage Bill was introduced in the New Zealand Parliament on the30th September.Renewed interest has been shown in the chances of a Coalition government being formed.(6) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Composite Minesweepers.All three vessels have been launched and installation of engines and boilersis proceeding.Steel Minesweepers.Construction of 9 is going forward, 5 of which are on Admiralty account.Brigadier Puttick has returned from the Middle East and taken up duties as Chief of the General Staff.General Sir Guy Williams has completed a 5 months&apos; tour as military adviser and has submitted his recommendations. The main proposals which arebeing implemented are : (a) Action to achieve a general strengthening of NewZealand coast defences, (b) The conversion of all mounted regiments into lightarmoured regiments. A few special horsed squadrons are, however, beingretained for certain special areas in the Dominion, (c) The Brigade in Eiji isto be brought up to full war establishment. The Local Defence Force in Tongais to be increased by raising native troops with New Zealand Officers and N.C.O.Instructors, and action is being taken to defend the aerodrome there. Coastwatching stations have also been established.A 6&quot; gun has been installed in Fanning Island.Expeditionary Force.The New Zealand Division in the Middle East is again at full strength.An Armed Tank Brigade is to be formed for overseas service and also certaincorps and army troops; the whole proposal involving an additional 6,000 men.To train this Army Tank Brigade an Armoured Vehicle School is to be formed.It will be staffed by experienced officers and N.C.O.&apos;s returned from the middle east and officers on loan from the War Office. This school will also train officersand N.C.O.&apos;s for certain Territorial Force units.A Command and Staff School is also to be established.Air Commodore L. V. Goddard (R.A.F.) has been appointed Chief of theAir Staff m succession to Air Commodore H. W. L. Saunders.The air forces in Fiji and Tonga have been reinforced from New Zealand.
(7) General Position.Generally speaking, the press has deprecated any agitation for the formationof a &quot; second front&quot; which, it is thought, would lead to Russia&apos;s needs beingoverlooked. An exception was the Natal Mercury, which urged action in theMiddle East. A widespread feeling was manifest, however, that the shifting ofthe war to the East had brought a perceptible slowing down of British and united States effort, and that aid to Russia was inadequate.The Opposition press used Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s recent speech in adefeatist sense under such headings as &quot; Britain&apos;s desperate appeal to a free world.&quot;Commenting on Mr. Eden&apos;s recent speech, Die Burger said that any attemptto couple economic freedom for Germany with military repression was doomedto failure.The bombing of Rome has been strongly advocated.Some of the pro-Government papers expressed a &quot; deep sense of uneasiness,&quot;which they said was growing throughout the Commonwealth, at the failure ofthe United Kingdom Government to take adequate steps against manoeuvres ofthe Vichy Government. The despatch of oil to French African ports was citedas one reason for this uneasiness.Pro-Government papers attached great importance to the inter-Alliedmeeting, and in particular to the Soviet Ambassador&apos;s approval of the atlantic charter.Much praise was given to President Roosevelt&apos;s broadcast, both as regardsits contents and the skill shown in not presenting a case to the Isolationists.A realistic attitude has been shown as regards the Eastern front and theGerman successes there were given due weight.In domestic affairs, open war has now been declared by the nationalist party on Ossewa Brandwag. This is supported by the Dutch Reformed Church.Already many Nationalists have resigned from the organisation, including theorganising secretaries in the Cape and Transvaal and, as previously stated, theChairman of the Ossewa Brandwag Council, and the conflict appears to bereaching a climax. Dr. Malan still panders to the pro-German feeling shown bysections of his audiences, although he insists that the Nazi system is not wantedin South Africa. Ossewa Brandwag is trying to induce General Hertzog toreturn to the political field as a rallying point against Malan; this is thoughtunlikely.The action of the Netherlands Legation in the Union in calling up Dutchcitizens in the Union for military service with the Netherlands Army in theUnited Kingdom was strongly criticised by the Transvaaler, as many of the menare said to be opposed to the war.The Government plan to control imports has been generally supported.Under a new regulation Union soldiers must be employed in their pre-war-positions for at least six months, instead of the previous minimum of one month.Comment on the Union Government&apos;s decision to postpone the ProvincialCouncil elections followed party lines but it seems clear that even the National-ists are relieved at not having to prepare for the election in their present dividedcondition.Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, in an interview with the United Kingdom HighCommissioner, expressed the view that, after the defeat of Nazism, the Opposi-tion parties in the Union would come together again, and that in that event thepolitical outlook was most unpromising, owing to the absence of any outstanding-British leaders in the Union, and to the reluctance of the British elements in thecommunity to go into public life.(8) Naval, Military and Air Activities.General Smuts visited South African troops in Egypt during August.Over 2,000 men of the 2nd South African Division reached Egypt inSeptember.The South African Railway Construction Companies now in the middle east have undertaken to carry out the construction of a new Haifa to Tripoli (S)to connect the Standard Gauge railways in Palestine and Syria.
The Union has undertaken the training of Rhodesians for the SouthernRhodesia Reconnaissance Unit.  The first party has arrived.The South African Air Force &quot; came of age &quot; on the 20th August, 1941, onwhich date its total strength was 2,268 officers and 20,901 other ranks. Inaddition, on that date, there were in the Union 440 R.A.F. Officers and 5,415 other ranks. Of this total, 9,690 officers and other ranks were undergoing training inSouth Africa. Some 30 Belgians from the Belgian Congo are being trained aspilots, observers and wireless operators.(9) Economic Activities.A system of general control of imports and exports came into effect on the15th September. The import of a number of non-essential articles from non-sterling countries was prohibited.Negotiations were completed for the repatriation of certain Union securitiesto the value of some  30 million. The vesting order was made on the 10th october and payment in gold will be completed by the Union by the end of the year.NEWFOUNDLAND.(10) General Position.The short visit of the Duke of Kent to Newfoundland is stated to have created immense enthusiasm among the population, some thousands of whom were able to see him. Mr. Shakespeare has also been in Newfoundland for a few days and the press comments on his visit have been highly favourable.Partly as a result of employment on the new American basis the number ofpersons in Newfoundland requiring relief continues to show a substantial declineas compared with recent years and all skilled workers are fully employed. Therevenue returns remain extremely satisfactory.(11) Naval, Military and Air Activities.A hundred naval recruits were despatched from Newfoundland during themonth. More men are ready to sail when transport becomes available and the newfoundland Government do not expect any difficulty in obtaining the balanceof about 800 men required to complete the quota which the Admiralty have so farundertaken to accept.SOUTHERN RHODESIA(12) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Regulations governing the formation of the Rhodesian Air Askari Corpswere published by the Governor on the 15th August. This corps, consisting of voluntary European and Native members, will be used principally to providearmed guards and labour services at the various Air Force establishments in theColony, and will be formed as a unit of the Air Section of the Territorial force.BASUTOLAND,   BECHUANALAND   PROTECTORATE   ANDSWAZILAND.13. Recruiting for the African Auxiliary Pioneer Corps in these territorieshas been most satisfactory and has already reached about 80 per cent, of the authorised maximum establishment; total attestations in the three territories nowamount to 15,615. Six Companies from Basutoland and 4 from bechuanaland protectorate recently embarked for the Middle East and made an excellentimpression at Durban.
EIRE.(14) General Position.The supply position still occupied first place in the minds of Irishmen. the eire Government through the Irish Shipping Company (virtually a Governmentconcern) continues their efforts to acquire ships for direct trade between Eireand the United States. They have also been developing a transhipment trade atLisbon and Vigo, goods being carried across the Atlantic in United States ships and from Portugal or Spain to Eire in small Eire-owned or chartered ships.One of the latter has, however, been sunk.Tea, coal, petrol, and kerosene are the commodities whose shortage mostaffects the ordinary man in Eire to-day. About the middle of September it wasdecided that, in view of the increase of our stocks, at the next monthly allocationthe Ministry of Food should release to Eire 37-1 Per cent- instead of 25 per cent, ofthe normal supply of tea. This should have enabled an increase in the weeklytea ration from half an ounce per head to three-quarters of an ounce. Actually,the Eire Government increased the ration to 1 ounce. Possibly this extraincrease is partly due to the arrangement which we know Eire is making to import tea from the United States. On the other hand, the coal situation has deteriorated further. The quantity of good quality gas coal allowed to Eire hashad to be reduced in turn to 1.500 tons per week and more recently to 1,000 tons per week, and gas production in Eire is likely to be seriously affected. Thequantity of inferior coal shipped to Eire has also had to be limited owing to shipping shortage.Following upon the apparent cessation of foot and mouth disease in Eireit was considered possible to lift the prohibition on the import from that country of fat cattle except for immediate slaughter and also of stores. Negotiationswith the Eire authorities have taken place on this point.There have been few developments in the political field in Eire this month.Mr. de Valera, in an interview with Sir John Maffey, put forward the suggestionthat he should take the lead in proposing publicly, in the interests of humanity,the abolition of night bombing. He felt that such a.development might be welcomeon both sides, but he was anxious not to take any action that would embarrassus in any way. After consultation with London, Sir John Maffey was asked toinform Mr. de Valera that we should not welcome any such move on his part.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.(15) Political Situation.1. Mr. Gandhi&apos;s civil disobedience campaign has progressively grownfeebler; very few of the satyagrahis who have served their original sentences haveobeyed the order to repeat their offence; and the growing volume of discontentwith the futility of the programme is beginning to find vent in open criticism and some secessions. Mr. Gandhi is, however, apparently unmoved, and the habit of blind obedience to the Mahatma still prevents any important revolt.2. The country generally has been quiet and free from communal out-breaks. The war industrial effort is in full swing, though sporadic strikes for higher wages occur. Improvements in the monsoon rains have reduced the fears of famine that existed in several3. There is little of importance to note in the political field. Mr. Jinnahexerted the discipline of the Moslem League successfully to compel the resigna-tions of the three Moslem Premiers of the Punjab, Bengal and Assam from theNational Defence Council, though he failed to dislodge Sir Sultan Ahmed fromthe Executive Council or Begum Shah Nawaz from the Defence Council by threats of excommunication from the Moslem League. The Premiers&apos; seats are being left vacant, and it remains to be seen whether Provincial dissatisfaction with thesituation will show itself strongly enough to force the Premiers to reconsider their decision. In at least one Province, Orissa, a significant attempt is being madeto form a coalition in the Legislature which would enable ministerial governmentto be resumed.
4. Opinion on the war remains steady, and British and Russian action in persia is generally regarded as fully justified. Some pessimism is, however, feltabout Russia&apos;s capacity to withstand increasing German pressure, withresultant danger to India. The attitude to Japan continues hostile, and evenbellicose.(16) Indian States.Nothing to report.(17) Naval. Military and Air Activities.Two more Indian Infantry Brigades have arrived in Iraq. The force nowconsists of three Indian Divisions and an Armoured Brigade (less one Regiment).His Majesty&apos;s Indian Sloops Sutlej and Jumna, which were on loan to HisMajesty&apos;s Government to assist in convoy work in the Atlantic, have now been released by the Admiralty from this duty and have proceeded to join the east indies Station.93 Mohawk aircraft for the equipment of 3 Fighter Squadrons have been allotted to India and should arrive by the end of 1941.(18) Foreign and Frontier Relations.1. Afghanistan. -Sir Francis Wylie had his first interview with theAfghan Prime Minister on the 8th September. The Prime Minister was cordial,but took the opportunity of complaining of His Majesty&apos;s Governments attitude in respect of the German colony, whom he claimed to be in a position to controlwithout difficulty. As regards Persia, the Prime Minister said that it was agreat mistake on our part to have let the Russians, whose very name was anathemato Islam, into Persia, and advised that we should settle matters with the PersianGovernment and get the Russians out of the country as soon as possible. Onthe war situation in general, he said that if the Russians were beaten in thenext few weeks His Majesty&apos;s Government should make peace with Germany,since our Military Forces were entirely inadequate. The Prime Minister didnot conceal his opinion that Germany was bound to win the war.His Majesty&apos;s Government haA^e now decided that an immediate request should be presented to the Afghan Government for the expulsion of non-officialAxis nationals from Afghanistan under guarantee of safe-conduct to Axis-controlled territory (the question of the disposal of the Axis Legations in Kabulwill be left for future consideration). This approach to the Afghan Govern -ment will be made on a friendly though firm basis, and no threats as to theconsequences of refusal will be employed. It has been agreed with the SovietGovernment that our approach should be accompanied by parallel representa-tions from the Soviet Government. If the Afghan Government show signs ofa definite willingness to meet us in this matter, a hint will be given to them ofmaterial advantages to be derived from co-operation with us which it is suggestedmight perhaps take the form of a free gift of money to the Afghan government from His Majesty&apos;s Government. There is reason to believe that events in Persiahave caused considerable nervousness in the Afghan Government as to their own position, and it may be hoped that with Russian resistance still strong, they may prove susceptible to pressure on this question.The question of the withdrawal from Kabul of Major Fletcher, the LegationPublicity Officer, to which a reference was made in the last report, has been settled by the decision to post him to Persia as Political Adviser to the NorthernCommand where his special language qualifications will be particularly valuable.The necessity of finding a suitable officer for this appointment provides an excellent pretext for his transfer so far as the Afghan Government is concerned.The abdication of the Shah is believed to have come as a severe shock to the ruling Family, but developments in Persia have caused no general stir in &quot;publicopinion in Afghanistan, partly, no doubt, owing to the absence of any lead fromthose in authority. Our association with &apos;&apos; Godless &apos;&apos; Russia was regarded asthe worst feature of the incident. Stories of atrocities in areas occupied by theRussians, particularly Meshed, are gaining currency, and rumours persist that similar action to that taken in Persia will follow shortly in Afghanistan, though these have quietened down somewhat in the last ten days. There is reason tobelieve that the Afghan Government have been taking soundings among tribal
leaders to ascertain how far the country would be behind them in the event of a threat to their independence from any quarter.2. North-West Frontier. The situation in Waziristan and the neigh -bouring districts continues to be unusually quiet. Contributory causes to thissatisfactory position are the recent operations in the Tochi Valley, the Faqir ofIpi&apos;s shortage of funds and loss of prestige generally, and the continued russian resistance. There is continued speculation on both sides of the frontier regardingthe possible repetition against Afghanistan of Anglo-Russian action in Persia.It may be noted that the Turis of the Khurram Valley, who are the largest Shiatribe on the Frontier, expressed pleasure and offered congratulations on the entry of British troops into Persia.3. Persian Gulf; The abdication of the Shah was welcomed by publicopinion, though doubt is felt as to the dispositions of his son. It is consideredthat the action taken in Persia has strengthened our position in the middle east.4. Sinkiang. Our Consul-General at Kashgar has been approached by theChinese Administrative Commissioner with a request for supplies of petroi and machinery from India, for which he is prepared to pay almost any price. TheGovernment of India are informing the Consul-General that they are willing topermit exports of limited quantities of petrol, though they cannot spare anymachinery at present. It is hoped that this may act as an inducement to theSinkiang Authorities to reopen the Leh trade route.(19) Economic.1. Prices. Although, contrary to expectations, the announcement of theJapanese freezing had no immediate adverse effect upon raw cotton prices in the bombay market, during the last three weeks of September there has been amarked deterioration, the quotation for Broach cotton having fallen from282-^ rupees per candy on the 9th September to 227-^- rupees on the20th September, and corresponding declines have occurred in the quotations forother varieties of Indian cotton.2. Labour. During the months May, June and July labour troubles do notappear to have interfered to any serious extent with the Indian war effort. a somewhat ominous textile strike at Nagpur was settled by the end of June on theinstitution of a Government enquiry into wages and conditions, and a threat of widespread trouble did not develop.On the whole, the labour situation seems to be satisfactory. The cost ofliving has risen and may rise further, but adjustments have been made andsettlements secured for the most part without widespread disputes.(20) Finance.Monetary Expansion. Upon the conclusion of the second year of war a briefreview of the changes in the Indian monetary circulation, and of their relation to price movements, may be of interest. In the following table the rupee figures have for convenience been converted into the equivalent in. sterling. The figures include Burma as well as India, since the two countries share a single currencysystem : 1st Year       2nd Year Totalof War. of War.

possible to express as an exact percentage increase, since the initial circulationis not known. Making, however, an approximate assumption on this account, onthe basis of such data as are available, it may be estimated that the currencycirculation as a whole (notes and coin) increased by between 39 and 45 per cent,during the first two years of war. In the same period wholesale prices in Indiaincreased by 42 per cent, according to the Statistical Research index, or by51 per cent, according to the Calcutta Wholesale index.BURMA.Report, by the Secretary of State for Burma.(21) General.The country on the whole is quiet.(22) Defence.During the month Burma was visited by the Commander-in-Chief, Far East,and the Air Officer Commanding, Singapore. The Commander-in-Chief seemedto be satisfied with the progress made in the construction of landing grounds.The locations for A.A. guns were also satisfactorily fixed.(23) External and Economic.During the month negotiations were opened between representatives of theGovernment of Burma and the Government of China with a view to restrictingChinese immigration. The negotiations have been inconclusive, as the proposalsof the Burma Government have been referred by the Chinese Delegation to theirown Government, and have been suspended in consequence of the departure ofthe Premier, U Saw, for England..The control of traffic on the Burma Road is stated to have resulted in anumber of Chinese speculative businesses having closed down.Paddy prices, which had fallen from 150 rupees at the end of July to136 rupees on the 28th August, rose to 160 rupees on the 27th September. action is contemplated with a view to controlling rice and cotton prices.During August the daily average of lorries crossing the Chinese frontierwas 223 outward and 166 inward. 15,700 tons of Chinese Government goods,including 10,000 tons of petrol, were transported. The reduction in tonnage isdue to the state of the road, which makes it necessary for new heavy lorries to travel unladen.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &apos;&apos; Colonies &apos;&apos; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)(24) Economic Affairs.(1) Supply of Colonial requirements from the United States.Owing to difficulties and delays in the Lease-Lend administration inAmerica, there has been little progress in the application of Lease-Lendprocedure to essential Colonial requirements; but satisfactory arrangements arein operation for securing the necessary priorities under the American system ofcontrol for orders of such requirements placed through commercial channels.(2) Cocoa.On the 19th September it was publicly announced that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will purchase the whole of the 1941-42 cocoa crop of the Gold Coast,
Nigeria and the French Cameroons. The West African Cocoa Control board will be responsible for the purchase and sale, as in the previous year. The pricepaid on the Coast by the Board has been increased by approximately  2 a ton,while the price paid to the Board by the Ministry of Food will remain the sameas last season.(3) Sisal.A reply has now been received to the offer to sell to the United States a totalof 40,000 tons of British East African and Netherlands East Indies sisal, andthe terms suggested by the United States authorities are now under considerationwith the other interested Departments.(25) Defence.The report of the Naval Security Mission to the United States on security arrangements in the West Indies has been examined by the Home Defence(Security) Executive, and arrangements are being made for the despatch ofadditional Security Officers and Field Security sections to certain West IndianColonies and for other security measures recommended by the Executive. Thequestion of United States assistance in this sphere has also been reviewed, andit has been recognised that as regards physical security, e.g., guarding vulnerable points, American assistance will be invaluable where British personnel is notavailable or requires reinforcement. It is thought that the most convenientmethod of securing the fullest assistance possible from the United States in thissphere would be through the Joint Defence Committees, which are being set upin those Colonies where American forces are stationed.(26) Labour.Two United Kingdom trade union officials have been selected for appoint-ment as Labour Officers in the Gold Coast and in Trinidad respectively. Thesetwo appointments were made from amongst a number of candidates whose nameshad been put forward by the Trades Union Congress and similar bodies consulted in the matter. These candidates are the first to be selected to fill an entirely newclass of appointment. A similar selection is expected to follow in the case of.Sierra Leone.Reports on Particular Colonies.(27) West Indies United States Bases.A corporal of the United States Forces has been charged with the murder ofa native of Antigua in St. Johns, outside the leased area. He is being tried by united States court-martial.  The trial opened on the 24th September.The United States have decided to establish their naval air station in the bahamas on Great Exuma instead of Mayaguana, the site originally chosen.Construction is to be started at once.(28) Jamaica.The Legislative Council have rejected the proposals submitted to them for areform of the constitution.  The question of future action is under consideration.(29) British Honduras.The second contingent of the Forestry Unit, some 270 men, has now arrived in Scotland.(30) West Africa.From the 8th to the 15th September a Tripartite Conference of Experts washeld at Lagos, at which British West Africa, the Free French African territories and the Belgian Congo were represented. The purpose of this Conference wasto discuss common economic problems, and particularly the better co-ordinationof imports, exports and shipping in this area.[23036] n
Shortly after this Conference, the British West African Governors unani-mously recommended the establishment of a West African Supply Centre, toensure full co-ordination of supplies and shipping in British West Africa. It isexpected that the Supply Centre will very soon be established.The Allied representatives on the Tripartite Conference were informed thatthe establishment of such a Centre was under discussion, and they expressed the wish that the Free French and Belgian Territories should participate in it.It is confidently expected that the Tripartite Conference, taking place as it did almost simultaneously with the recommendation for a Supply Centre, willquickly lead to the most valuable results.(31) Malaya.Since the freezing of Japanese assets, the Japanese community in Malayahave shown a general inclination to return to Japan, although the movementshave been restricted by the lack of shipping facilities. A close watch is being kept on the rate of departures. A request for diplomatic immunity for thebaggage of the wife of the Japanese Consul-General in Singapore and certain members of his staff who were returning to Japan was refused; it has since beenreported that the subsequent search of their luggage has produced results ofinterest.(32) Sarawak.The new constitution for the State of Sarawak has now been examined here,and the Government, of Sarawak are being informed that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, having satisfied themselves, as the result of consultation, that the newconstitution&apos;does not infringe their rights under the 1888 Treaty, do not feel calledupon to express views on a matter in which they have no legal standing. It isalso being made clear that, while there is no necessity for consultation with HisMajesty&apos;s Government on each and every occasion an amendment of the constitu-tion is under consideration, His Majesty&apos;s Government fully reserve the rightto make effective representations, if their information leads them to suppose that any amendment under consideration would be contrary to the terms of any agreement existing between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of sarawak. The proposals of the Government of Sarawak for the appointmentof a British Representative in the State have also been received. They provide that the officer appointed shall hold office during His Majesty&apos;s pleasure, andthat his advice must be sought and acted upon on all matters affecting therelations of Sarawak with foreign States and on all matters of defence; and his services would also be available for consultation on matters touching the general administration of the State. Acceptance of these proposals in principle has beennotified to the Sarawak authorities, but discussions are still continuing on details.The centenary of the establishment of &quot; Brooke &quot; rule in Sarawak wasofficially celebrated in Kuching on the 24th September, and messages were sentto the Rajah from His Majesty The King and from His Majesty&apos;s Government.To mark the occasion, the Rajah announced the loan to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentof $2 million free of interest for the period of the war.After a survey of the precautionary scheme for denying to the Japanese the oilfields and refinery in Sarawak and Brunei, it has been decided to proceedforthwith to the &quot; plugging &quot; of the more important wells and the evacuation of staff and equipment to Singapore, where they can be usefully employed on important work.(33) Ceylon.The Governor has reported that the conversations between representativesof the Governments of India and Ceylon have been successfully concluded, withagreement reached on all subjects. Detailed information is not yet availablepending the receipt of the report of the Ceylon delegates. It would be prematureyet to estimate what political effects the agreement will have, but it may certainly be hoped that it will lead to improved relations between India and Ceylon.The Commander-in-Chief in India has recommended the inclusion of Ceylonin his operational and administrative command forthwith, in order to give himcontrol of the measures for defence which have to be put in hand in preparation
for a threat to the Island in the event of war in the Far East. The Governor hasadvised that the present juncture would be inappropriate for political reasons in ceylon; but in view of the satisfactory conclusion which has just been reached by the Indian and Ceylon representatives, as mentioned above, Sir AndrewCaldecott has been asked whether the local political objections any longer apply.* - (34) Northern Rhodesia.The two main questions affecting Northern Rhodesia at the present time are (a) amalgamation with Southern Rhodesia and (b) the situation at theCopperbelt.(a) Amalgamation.The views of the Royal Commission regarding the possibility of immediateamalgamation with Southern Rhodesia came as a bitter disappointment toEuropeans in Northern Rhodesia, and the unofficial members of the LegislativeCouncil have raised the question in Council from time to time in the form ofmotions seeking the annexation of the Territory and an alteration in the corn-position of the Council to provide for an unofficial majority. It is evident from recent debates that the unofficial members of the Council, while of the opinionthat they will not get amalgamation for some years, are chafing at their positionin the Council, which they consider to be one of representation without responsi-bility. A Labour party has been formed in the Territory, and at recent electionsthey have secured 5 of the 8 unofficial seats in the Legislative Council. The sup-porters of this party are, in the main, strong adherents of the Southern Rhodesianative policy in regard to labour, which means the exclusion of Africans fromskilled employment.   They are also strongly in favour of amalgamation.Recent public pronouncements by the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesiaindicate a steadily growing impatience on the question of amalgamation, andSir Godfrey Huggins has gone so far as to suggest in a speech recently that southern Rhodesia should offer to pay the expense of a Convention which couldbe held in Southern Rhodesia, and at which delegates from the two Rhodesiasand Nyasaland should draft a Constitution for the three Territories, which shouldbe sent to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for their accept-ance. I have also recently received from Lord Lugard a private note of a conversation on the subject with the High Commissioner for Southern Rhodesia,Mr. Lanigan 0&apos;Keefe. The High Commissioner, in reply to a suggestion thatamalgamation should be postponed until after the war, said that the issue hadbeen raised tAvo years ago and Southern Rhodesia could wait no longer.Lord Hailey&apos;s memoranda on his visits to the three Territories have beenreceived in the Colonial Office and are in process of being printed. In LordHailey&apos;s view there is a wide divergence between the native policy of SouthernRhodesia and that of the two Northern Territories. Copies of the memoranda willbe sent as soon as possible to the Governments concerned, and the question offurther action will then be considered.(b) Copperbelt.The difficulties of the situation at the Copperbelt have not disappeared sincethe settlement of the European and African strikes of 1940. The Europeanmine-workers have from time to time presented the mines managements withdemands for improved wages &amp;o, and in the main their demands have been met.Their most recent and important request was for the grant of the &quot; closed shop,&quot;i.e., an undertaking by the mines managements that only Union men will beemployed at the mines. This too has now been conceded, although it may not bepossible to give full effect to it, owing to the existence of emergency regulations which preclude a mine-worker from leaving his employment and the miningcompanies from dismissing an employee without the consent of the Governor.There are also difficulties arising out of the recommendation of the 1940Copperbelt Commission that discussions should be held between the Government,the Union and the Mines Managements with a view to affording skilled and semi-skilled African workers opportunities for serving in the better paidpositions.
The general background to the situation at the Copperbelt is that themajority of the European mine-workers are loyal and anxious to assist the war effort. Their affairs are, however, in the hands of an unscrupulous leader, whopresses his demands to the point of threatening to call a strike. When onedemand has been satisfied, it is not long before it is followed by further requests for improvement either in wage or other conditions. He fully appreciates the difficult position in which the mining companies are placed at this time, whenthe supply of copper forms a vital part of the war effort of the Empire, and. takesevery advantage of it. He is careful, however, to keep within the law. Theposition is that, while this man occupies the position of the General Secretaryof the Mine Workers&apos; Union, the possibility of trouble flaring up is never absent,and demands are usually accompanied by a threat that the Union &quot; will fight&quot;. if they are not met.(35) Palestine.During September there were no developments in local Arab politics. Thereturn of three prominent &quot;exiles,&quot; formerly supporters of the Mufti, arousedlittle public interest. Their attempts at &quot;face-saving&quot; have not been particularly successful. There are further signs that the influence of the Muftiis declining; former hangers-on of the Majlis party are moving slowly &quot; fumbling &quot; is the High Commissioner^ word towards a rapprochement withthe Defence party (Arab &quot; moderates &quot;), or the Government.- The appointment by General Catroux of a President of Independent Syriawas popular with the moderates, though Sheikh take  Ed Din is disparaged as anineffectual nominee of the French. There were the usual complaints aboutPalestine reaping no benefit from developments in this part of the world.The resolution and speed of Anglo-Russian intervention in Persia created avery favourable impression. Misgivings over action taken in collaboration with&quot; the Bolsheviks &quot; against an independent Moslem country were quite over-shadowed, despite all the efforts of Axis propaganda to raise the religious issue.There has been no recrudescence of the organised Irgun (Jewish&quot;Revisionist&quot;) terrorism mentioned in last month&apos;s report, though there havebeen isolated acts of violence. The Revisionist leaders are in negotiation withthe Citizen Union (a &apos;&apos; Right&apos;&apos; organisation led by the Mayor of Tel Aviv) witha view to forming a united political front.
