(R) (41) 75:December 24, 1941.WAR CABINET.REPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER 1941 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.(1) General Position.MUCH attention was given to speeches made in November by Mr. Churchill,which have led to a feeling of optimism. It was felt that the war situation had greatly improved, and the declaration of our air parity with Germany was recognised as a most encouraging factor. The press has, however, been careful to moderate this generally-felt enthusiasm, and to point out that no ground exists for complacent thinking about the war.1 Lord Halifax&apos;s references in his speech in Ottawa on the 20th November tothe Canadian war effort were much appreciated.The opening of the campaign in Libya aroused enthusiasm in the press, butin face of the lack of any quick success the Canadian attitude may be said to be one of sober confidence in the ultimate outcome.With regard to Foreign Affairs, much interest was shown in the news from france of General Weygand&apos;s dismissal, which was thought to have been madeon direct orders from Hitler. A period of greater collaboration between Vichyand Germany was foreshadowed. One reaction has been the recurrence of demands for the removal of the Vichy representative in Canada. There has been much unfavourable publicity for the hews that Marshal Petain receives anannuity from a Canadian insurance company via London. Surprisingly enough,there was little comment on the seizure of the Vichy convoy.Editorial comment on the appointment of M. Litvinov as Soviet ambassador to the United States of America was generally very favourable.   The news of the &apos;strong and continued Russian resistance has engendered a feeling of optimism,which was hitherto lacking, as to the capacity of the Russians to withstand theGerman attacks.The Far Eastern situation was viewed with considerable gloom, and regardedas more or less hopeless. While considerable attention wa,s paid to the Kurusumission there was no feeling that the&apos;mission would succeed in reaching1 a settle-ment. The arrival of Canadian troops in Hong Kong was regarded as showingincreased firmness to Japan and consequently was very well received.[23279] b
Canadians have shown very great interest in the part which Finland hasbeen taking in the war. The general attitude has been to regard Finland as ahelpless and reluctant pawn in the German game.Towards the end of the month this attitude changed, and comment was-distinctly unfriendly, and it was felt that the sooner war was declared onFinland, Hungary and Roumania the better.The United States revision of the Neutrality Act was enthusiasticallyreceived. Canadian approval of President Roosevelt continued, but wastempered Avith some criticism of what was commonly regarded as his weakattitude towards John L. Lewis and the C.I.O.(2) Naval. Military and Air Activities.The first section of a new floating dry dock has been launched.The keel of the third &quot; Tribal &quot; class destroyer for the Royal Canadian Navyhas been laid down.   This is in addition to the two &quot; Tribal &quot;class destroyersbuilding in England and launched in September and November respectively.. v.. There are now 52 Royal Canadian Navy corvettes in operation out of st. John&apos;s as ocean escorts for convoys. . ,The Canadian Corps has now moved into the Sussex area.The Canadian Army Tank Brigade is carrying out training on Churchilltanks in preparation for a change-over to this type.The 5th Canadian Armoured Division arrived safely in the United Kingdom.No. 400 A/C. Squadron (Tomahawks) has-been engaged in reconnaissance and photographic work off the north-east coast of France. No. 401 Squadron(Spitfires), during fighter sweeps, destroyed four enemy aircraft. No. 402Squadron (Hurricane bombers) made several sorties over occupied territory withfairly successful results. This form of attack is still in the experimental stage,the chief difficulty experienced being to locate the target when flying at a low level. The squadron also carried out a successful dive-bombing attack on anenemy aerodrome. No. 403 Squadron (Spitfires) was engaged in shipping-protection patrols. No. 404 Squadron (Blenheims) carried out sweeps and anti-submarine patrols in the area Norwegian coast-Shetland Islands-faroe islands and totalled about 500 flying hours during the month. No. 411 Squadron(Spitfires) destroyed one German bomber. No. 412 Squadron (Spitfires) carriedout nUrherous day and night sorties. No. 406 Squadron (night-Beaufigbters)&apos;hit one German bomber and probably destroyed it. No. 409 Squadron (night^-rBeaufighters) destroyed one enemy aircraft. Nos. 411, 412 and 409 were allvisited by His Majesty King George VI during the month. No. 410 Squadron(night-Defiants) flew more than 20 operational patrols without interception.No. 405 Squadron (Wellingtons) attacked Dunkirk (twice), Boulogne, Hamburg(twice), Emden and Berlin without loss. No. 407 Squadron (Hudsons) has,been engaged against enemy shipping off the Dutch and Danish coasts. The squadronscored direct hits on ships totalling about 77,000 tons. One ship of 6,000 tons was blown up and another of 900 tons sank within four minutes. No. 413Squadron (Catalinas) has been working under most severe weather conditions overthe Northern Atlantic. Gales reaching 80 miles an hour, snow, sleet and, on one occasion, more than 70 degrees of frost have been encountered.. At the end of the month 19 Royal Canadian Air Force squadrons were either in operation or had been formed in the United Kingdom. Nos. 416 and 417(Fighter) and 418 (Intruder) Squadrons were formed&apos; during the month. v*&quot;COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.; (3) General Position.During the course of the month public attention has mainly been concentrated on events in the Far East. The news of the reinforcement at Singapore bypowerful units of the British fleet was very well received. The loss of H.M.A.S.Sydney quickened Australian appreciation of the nearness of war, and thogrowing danger in the Pacific area. In this connection Australia watched theprogress of the ^S^^^P&quot;apanese. talks closely and anxiously. . Mr. ChurchilVsstatement about joint action with the United States of America had a very favourable reception. ...    ,.
(4) Naval, Military and Air Activities.His Majesty&apos;s Australian cruiser Sydney sank the German raider Steiermarkon the 19th November 170 miles south-west of Carnarvon (Western Australia).Both ships were set on fire during the action, and the raider subsequently blewup. Extensive sea searches and air reconnaissances from the 24th to the 29thfailed to find any trace of H.M.A.S. Sydney or to locate any survivors.H.M.A.S. Deloraine, minesweeper, has been commissioned for service.General Sir Thomas Blarney, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., Deputy Commander-in-- Chief, Middle East, visited Australia for consultations with the CommonwealthGovernmentCertain cavalry units of the Australian military forces have been selected for special mechanised training with a view to their being used in forming the1st Armoured Division, A.I.F.NEW ZEALAND. ..    ; - (5) General Position.As in Australia, the Fair Eastern situation was the major preoccupation in new Zealand throughout November. As elsewhere, the dramatic event&quot;of Japan&apos;sentry into the war in December makes New Zealand comment during Novembernow merely of academic interest, but it may be noted that New Zealanders feltlittle confidence in the possible success of the Kurusu mission. The view takenwas that, if Japan entered the war, the worst effects for New Zealand would, behit and run raids.The Premier of Burma&apos;s dissatisfaction with the result of his London visit was reported in the local press, but there has been no.indication of any sympathy,for Burmese aspirations. - :\?J[23279] bT&quot;News of the first successes of the Libyan campaign was warmly received, andwas regarded as an adequate reply to the generally expressed demand for a second front. Australians hope that complete success in Libya may result in the collapse of Italy.Tribute has been paid to the work of the Royal Navy in relieving the australians at Tobruk, and publicity has been given to Morshead&apos;s statementdescribing &quot; the warm affection &quot; which has sprung up between all British and allied Forces in Tobruk.In foreign affairs the situation on the Russian front during Novemberoccasioned some depression, but towards the end.of the month comment becamedefinitely more optimistic.The Australian press did not mince matters when discussing the position off inland, Roumania and Hungary, and the general opinion appeared to be thatthe United Kingdom had shown weakness in not defining its attitude towardsthese satellites of the Axis earlier.President Roosevelt&apos;s Navy Day speech was commonly believed in australia to have brought America to the brink of full participation in the war.In home affairs, one of the main events of interest has been Mr. Duff Cooper&apos;visit to Australia, which has been very much appreciated, and has been taken as a pointer of-the United Kingdom Governments intention increasingly to consult Australian views on Far Eastern problems. There has been some press comment that sufficient attention has not been paid by Australian politicians toPacific problems. In the words of the Sydney Morning Herald, &quot; we have lookedtoo much at our &apos; near North &apos; through the eyes of Britain, to whom it is the&apos; Far East.&apos; &quot;The new Governments budget has been widely discussed, and has had only alukewarm press. The Prime Minister found it necessary to broadcast an appeal for support for the war loan, which was, in the end, fully subscribed on the lastday, although out of 2,700,000 wage earners, subscriptions only came from only60,000.The press showed a growing concern on account of luxury spending, which appeared to be on the increase.
Towards the end of the month much interest was shown in the Libyancampaign, and satisfaction expressed that New Zealand troops were being-employed. It has been generally recognised that Axis resistance will be tougherthan that of last year, but, whilst a realistic attitude is taken towards thedifficulties of the campaign, at the same time it has been emphasised that theBritish Forces need quick results.: In the sphere of foreign politics, the Russian news has been followed withanxious attention. Some credence has been given to reports of a possible Anglo-Russian Command in the Caucasus, There has been some question about the scopeof bur aid to Russia, and there appears to be a certain feeling that more practicalassistance should be given.The difficulties in the way of declaring war on Finland, Roumania and hungary were appreciated in New Zealand.Considerable interest was taken in the interception of the Vichy convoy. Itwas recognised that this incident placed a severe strain on Anglo-French relations,and it was doubted whether the advantage of the United Kingdom maintaining a listening post at Vichy was not outweighed by the serious breach in the blockadewhich would continue unless Anglo-French relations were severed.In home affairs, there was general satisfaction with the new schedule for meatprices which had been announced by the New Zealand Government. Favourablecomment has been noted for the terms of the agreement with the United kingdom for meat purchases.General Blamey&apos;s remarks on the complacent attitude of Australians has led the press to comment that the New Zealand war effort compares favourably withthat of Australia.As in Australia, Mr. Duff Cooper&apos;s visit to New Zealand has been very well received. He has spoken to large and enthusiastic audiences, and has made a deepimpression. The Evening Post referred to the visit as one &apos;&apos; of inestimablevalue,&quot; and his speeches as a &quot; shock to our complacency.&quot;(6) Naval, Military and Air Activities.H.M.N.Z.S. Achilles and H.M.N.Z.S. Leander have both been engaged on escort and convoy duties during the month.Representatives of the New Zealand Government visited Fiji during themonth for the purpose of defining defence responsibilities. An agreement hasbeen drawn up whereby the New Zealand Government accepts full and direct responsibility for the defence of Fiji and territories in High Commission for western Pacific within the boundaries of New Zealand Naval Station.A Women&apos;s Land Corps is being formed; term of service is for the duration of the war.The Women&apos;s War Service Auxiliary now has 30,000 members.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.(7) General Position.The news of the reduction of British shipping losses and the achievement of air parity with Germany has been warmly welcomed in the pro-Governmentpress, and it was noticeable that the Opposition press refrained from comment.The recent statements on the status of India by Mr. Amery has been thesubject of some comment. The pro-Government press supported Mr. Amery&apos;decision, but there has also been bitterly critical comment from the Oppositionpress, to the effect that Britain was still the same old Imperialist Power in sofar as India was concerned.There was some critical press comment on American moves, such as theamendment of the Neutrality Act, during the month, though it was generally recognised that the United States were gradually coming much nearer to fullparticipation in the war.General Smuts&apos;s speech on. the. vital necessity for a Jewish national homehas been a topic of some interest, and there appears to be appreciation of theUnited Kingdom difficulties in&apos;&apos;dealing both with Jewish national and pan-Arabquestions.
Anglo-Russian relations, and speculations about the opening of a second front, have been general topics of discussion throughout the month. News of thefighting on the Russian front has been followed with interest, but not apparentlywith any degree of anxiety.The Libyan campaign has, naturally, been of the greatest interest to allshades of South African opinion. The pro-Government press warned its readersagainst any over-optimism, and the anti-Government press followed its usual line,of stressing all the unfavourable developments which have so far been evident inthe campaign.Some unfavourable comment has been evoked by the Union&apos;s failure to givediplomatic recognition to the Soviet Union.The United Kingdom High Commissioner has sent fuller particulars ofthe important speech delivered by General Smuts at the annual meeting of theUnited Party Congress at Bloemfontein (see report for October). In this speechthe Prime Minister spoke of domestic politics of the Union and of his vision ofthe post-war future of South Africa. The emphasis of his speech lay on thegrowth and development of industry, on social legislation and on action in theeconomic sphere. This speech was naturally well reported in the pro-Governmentpress, but impatience and scepticism with the Government plans for socialreconstruction were obvious in the comments of the Opposition papers.The difficulties within the Opposition parties continue to stir Union political life. Briefly, the position is that, in order to heal the breach between theNationalist party and the Ossewa Brandwag, Dr. Malan proposed a scheme forthe formation of a National Committee. Dr. van Rensburg, leader of theOssewa Brandwag, however, stood aloof from the proposed new committee, andMr. Pirow and his New Order Group have manoeuvred to prevent anyrapprochement between the National Committee group and the Ossewa Brandwag,in order that he may eventually combine the Ossewa Brandwag and his own groupas the&quot; basis for National Socialist Afrikanerdom. A meeting took place betweenDr. Malan and van Rensburg and representatives of other Nationalistorganisations, but nothing is known yet of the results of this meeting. TheOssewa Brandwag have recently been plotting to destroy the defence installations and Government buildings in Durban, and the Minister of the Interior was compelled to take the strong action of interning the ring-leaders.It is interesting to note that none of the ten Afrikaner members ofParliament have shown any signs of following in the footsteps of their formerleader, General Hertzog, and, indeed, such signs as are evident point to an eventual reconciliation between these members and the United party.The Government United party has just won a striking victory in theNewcastle by-election, which has a large Afrikaner vote, the size of themajority (1,328) far surpassing the highest expectations of the Government. Theresult is regarded as a serious set-back for the Opposition, whose candidate also had the support of Ossewa Brandwag.Opposition is being shown to suggestions that British immigration into theUnion should be fostered after the war. The &quot; Nationalist Afrikaners wouldhave nothing to do with it.&quot;(8) Naval, Military and Air Activities.There are now 46 vessels in commission in the Seaward Defences.The First South African Division was deployed on the left at the openingof the Libyan offensive and moved forward in tlhe direction of El Gobi, which, itreached on the fourth day of the advance, This Division was subsequentlyinvolved in severe fighting in the Sidi Rezegh area, where its Fifth Brigade was heavily attacked by enemy armoured troops on the 22nd and 23rd November.The Second South African Division moved up to Sidi Omar on the28th November and was employed in the Bardia and Frontier areas.NEWFOUNDLAND.(9) General Position.Sir Lionel Warner, former General Manager of the Mersey Docks and harbour Board, has sailed for Newfoundland, where he will act as Chairman
of the Board which has been appointed to enquire into matters in dispute betweenthe Employers&apos; Association and the Longshoremen&apos;s Union.Eevenue returns remain buoyant and the surplus for the financial yearcommencing the 1st July last is now estimated at about 5 million dollars, ascompared with the original estimate of million dollars. In view of the increasing cost of living, the Newfoundland Government have removed the warrevenue tax (which applies to imports from countries outside the sterling area)in the case of certain articles important to the working-class budget.(10) SOUTHERN RHODESIA.Lieutenant-Colonel Guest, the Southern Rhodesian Minister for Air, whohas recently visited Southern Rhodesian personnel in the Middle East, will shortly arrive in this country in order to see various aspects of the UnitedKingdom war effort.(11) EIRE.Some disquiet has been voiced by sections of the Press at the lack ofresponse to appeals by Mr. de Valeria for recruits to the Eire Army and local defence Force. In a speech on the 17th November, in the presence of the Chiefof Staff and other high Army officers, Mr. de Valera said that &quot;the fact wehave not compulsory military service ought to cause every young man to take itas a point of honour to join up, and that without delay.&quot;At Limerick on the 30th November Mr. de Valera again uttered a warningon Eire&apos;s danger and appealed for the formation of a well-trained Red Crossorganisation, and also in the course of his speech appealed to the farmers foran additional 150,000 acres of wheat during the coming year. &quot;It is mostimportant as a defence measure to see that the community cannot at any time be held to ransom for the lack of some vital necessity such as food or fuel.&quot;An attack was made on the steamship Cambria, the Holyhead to Kingstownmail-boat, on the night of the 1st December by an aircraft about 2J miles inside the Kish Light off Dublin. The Cambria carried 370 passengers and a crew of 85.Following this attack it was stated in Dublin on the 3rd December that therewas reason to think that probably such attacks on shipping close to the shoresof Eire might be intensified very soon.A German parachutist, who landed in Eire more than eighteen months ago and has been sought ever since by special officers of the Eire Police, is now in prison in Dublin. He is believed to be Hermann Goertz, although he carried aGerman soldier&apos;s identification card bearing another name.The formation of an Irish Brigade from battalions of existing IrishRegiments has now been approved in principle. The Brigade will consist of the6th Battalion, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers; 1st Battalion, Royal IrishFusiliers and 2nd Battalion, London Irish Rifles. These Battalions are not, ofcourse, exclusively Irish. The proportion of Irishmen in them, including Irishmenfrom the North, averages about 50 per cent. The Brigade will form in Englandand the 6th Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, are to be brought over from northern Ireland for the purpose. The intention is that publicity shall be deferred until the Brigade has distinguished itself in action or some other specialoccasion has arisen.There is no special change in the supply position, A number of orders underthe Control of Import Acts, 1934-37, were made by the Eire authorities towardsthe end of November showing quota periods for various commodities, includingboots and shoes, motor cars, hats and caps of felt and metal screws.A favourable trade balance of  325,541 for the month of October was shownin the Trade Statistics for that month issued by the Department of Industry and commerce. The last occasion on which there was a favourable balance was inNovember 1940, when the balance was  518,758. The total trade for Octoberwas  6,052,773, as against  4,660,888 in September, Imports totalled  2,863,616and exports  3,189,157.
INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.(12) Political Situation.1. The Civil Disobedience campaign had so far lost its vitality that whenthe Legislative Assembly in the middle of the month debated a motion for thegeneral release of political prisoners the Government of India felt able to announce that they would give early and careful consideration, in consultationwith Provincial Governments, to the possibility of a general release of the CivilDisobedience prisoners (numbering about 5,000) who still remained in jail. no decision, however, had been announced by the end of the month.2. The most interesting political development during the month was theissue on the 23rd November of a Proclamation by the Governor of Orissarevoking the Proclamation made two years earlier under section 93 of theGovernment of India Act by which the administration was taken into theGovernor&apos;s hands upon the resignation of the Congress Ministry. Increasingdissatisfaction with the political stalemate led to a coalition of groups in Orissaother than the official Congress party, and, as the coalition seemed to be assured of a sufficient though narrow majority in the Legislature, the Governor felt ableto invite the Raja of Parlakimedi to form a Ministry. Reactions in other provinces are awaited with interest.3. Anxiety over the course of events in Russia has replaced the easyoptimism which followed the first stages of the German invasion, but on thewhole belief in the ultimate achievement of victory by Allied arms is maintained.As a result of confidence in our defences in the Far East and in the policy of theUnited States, slight attention is said to have been paid to the attitude adoptedby Japan. . ,.. (13) Indian States. ..Political agitation in the States is at a minimum, and there is nothing toreport. 1(14) Naval and Military Activities.1. General Headquarters, India, assumed responsibility for the Defence of ceylon with effect from the 22nd November, 1941, and Major-General R. D.Inskip, C.B., C.I.E., has been appointed to command. ;v3. -The Government of India have agreed that the R.I.N. Sloops Sutlej andJumna, may be.used for convoy duties in the Mediterranean as required.(15) Foreign and Frontier Relations.1. A afghanistan.-The Axis nationals who were removed from Afghanistanduly arrived in Peshawar without incident, and have since been passed on viaKarachi to Iraq and Turkey, reaching Angora on the 23rd November. TheAfghan Loe Jirga met on the 6th November to pronounce on the Afghan Govern-menfs foreign policy in connection with the removal of the Axis colonies. TheAssembly was addressed by leading Mullahs, by the Foreign Minister, PrimeMinister and War Minister and also by the King. Emphasis in the speecheswas, as might be expected, on the resolve of the Afghans to defend their independence if necessary &quot;with their last drop of blood.&quot; The Assemblypassed a resolution in which the chief points were :- -(a) The occupation of the whole or part of Afghanistan would not be tolerated.&apos;&apos; &quot; &apos; (6) The Use of land or air routes in Afghanistan must in no circumstances be considered. i;(c) No Treaty should be entered into with any Power which might prejudice the neutrality of Afghanistan.(d) The right of Afghanistan to have diplomatic relations with any countryshe liked must be preserved.
The Prime Minister was very successful in managing the Assembly so as toavoid criticism of the Governments policy (the removal of the Germans and italians does not seem to have been specifically mentioned). On the whole theresult of the meeting may be considered to be satisfactory; but the general impression created by the Assembly is one of complete national unity in the face of any threat of foreign aggression, and of the need for great caution inapproaching such questions as the desirability of removing the Axis Legationsor of attempting to send supplies to Russia via Afghanistan.In an interview at the end of the month, Sir Francis Wylie informed thePrime Minister and the Foreign Minister of His Majesty&apos;s Governments offer of a gift of  500,000 as assistance towards meeting internal difficulties. ThePrime Minister said he was most grateful for the offer and would consult hiscolleagues. If they desired to accept the offer he would ask that they shouldreceive assistance in kind and not in money, and subsequently the Foreign minister made it clear that the Afghan Government would like to receive at any rate some part of the assistance in the form of arms. Sir Francis Wylie explained that itwas highly unlikely that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have arms to spareat the present time. The Prime Ministers request maybe somewhat embarrassing,since the offer of monetary assistance was made deliberately in view of thedifficulty of finding anything in the way of assistance in kind in presentcircumstances which the Afghan Government requires.2. North-West Frontier. The Frontier remains quiet and there have been no fresh moves by the Faqir of Ipi. In Waziristan increased freedom of movementon the road is reported and a number of hostiles have surrendered. In the districtsthere have been some cases of attacks on lorries by hostile gangs. In one case inDera Ismail Khan a gang which had kidnapped twenty-four passengers from alorry was pursued by civil armed forces which succeeded in killing four of thehostiles and capturing six more. Seven passengers were murdered, but the restwere rescued. The six captured hostiles were promptly put on trial andcondemned to death, and it is hoped that this will have a salutary effect. InBannu several recent arrests of sympathisers and agents of the hostiles have rendered a collection of subscriptions and supplies for raiding parties moredifficult. Little reaction to the meeting of the Afghan Loe Jirga has been observed on the Indian side of the Frontier.(16) Economic.Wheat Purchases in India. India in ordinary times only becomes anexporter of wheat when world prices are high and the Indian crop large. she has recently been called upon to supply wheat for the Middle East and Persia,where crops have been poor and supplies are short. It was intended to buy50,000 tons in October and large quantities monthly thereafter. Meanwhile therewere reports of shortage in India itself and the Government of India to checkrising prices reduced the import duty and asked for a shipload of australian wheat to be imported as priming to check hoarding and rising prices. For a timethe rise was checked and the Ministry of Food continued buying, but during thelast half of November prices have risen beyond the limit set by the Governmentof India and the Ministry of Food have agreed to an announcement to discouragespeculation and also to keep off the market themselves for a time with a view toletting prices fall. The Ministry of War Transport have also agreed to theloading of two ships for India with Australian wheat. Meanwhile sufficientwheat is at the disposal of the Ministry of Food to cover that part of their immediate programme which is to be filled in India, but unless prices fall theposition at the end of the year may be difficult. The Government of India have mentioned publicly the possibility that they may have to resort to a wheatpurchasing commission. Anxiety about the new crop is partly, at least, the causeof the present stringency. If the new crop fails the export of wheat from india for the next month or two will be difficult.(17) Finance.Nothing to report.      &apos; \ 1
BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.(18) General.The country on the whole is quiet.There has been no important communal trouble, but a state of tensioncontinues.Press activity has been concerned largely with U Saw&apos;s visit to England.Disappointment was expressed at his final statement, but this is largely a continuation of the press agitation for the application of the third article of the atlantic Charter to Burma.(19) Defence.A further batch of American pilots has joined the International Air Force.Their operational training is proceeding satisfactorily, but there is a lack of spares and maintenance staff. The Governor, in a telegram dated the27th November, has reported that an advance party of R.A.F. personnel have left for Kunming and Chungking in China to maJke preliminary arrangements for a fighter squadron for the Force.A reinforcing brigade with some ancillary troops left India for Burma on the25th November.(20) External and Economic.A proposal to pull up the rails on certain non-essential sections of the BurmaRailways for the Burma-China railway construction is under consideration.Agitation continues against the delay in putting into force the IndianImmigration Agreement, which was concluded with the Government of India last july, but with some of the provisions of which they are now dissatisfied. Formalreopening of the negotiations would be likely to lead to communal trouble, butdiscussions between Ministers and the Government of India&apos;s Agent, with theGovernor in the Chair, have been arranged in the hope of removing the deadlock.The price of paddy has fallen to Rs. 140 from Rs. 179 during the previous month. The Rice Control Scheme is still under discussion. Indian merchantshave taken a prominent part in opposing it, but certain concessions have beenmade to meet their views.During October the daily average of lorries crossing the Chinese frontier was196 outwards and 174 inwards. 17,309 tons of Chinese Government goods weretransported, of which nearly 12,000 tons were petrol.General Magruder and party visited Burma in connection with co-ordinationof traffic on the China Road.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot;is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot;Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)(21) Economic Affairs.(1) Supply of Colonial Requirements from United States.A number of orders for &quot;finished &quot; iron and steel which had been placedon behalf of the Colonies in the United States in the first half of this year, seemed unlikely to be met, and arrangements have been made to return the more urgentof these for manufacture in the United Kingdom. Amongst others so returnedare certain orders for raw materials required by factories in Palestine for themanufacture of military supplies.[23279] c
(22) Defence.(1) Western Pacific.His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the United Kingdom and in the Common-wealth of Australia have recently approved new defence measures at Vila inthe New Hebrides Condominium, and at Tulagi in the British Solomon IslandsProtectorate. These places are of some strategic importance in view of the locationthere of advanced air bases used by Australian flying boats for reconnaissancepurposes. The Commonwealth Government are sending an Australian ImperialForce section to each of the two places to protect the bases, and in addition local forces are being raised by the Colonial Authorities, some on a permanent andsome on a part-time basis.(2) Malaya.With a view to preventing sabotage to Japanese fishing boats and gear inMalayan waters and to Japanese workshops and stores at Singapore, authority has been given to the Governor of the Straits Settlements, acting in concert withthe Commander-in-Chief, China, to place armed guards in such vessels andpremises, and to detain key Japanese personnel suspected of attempting sabotage,on receipt of the Warning Telegram or even, if necessary, before. The importanceof avoiding premature action has been emphasised to the Governor, and he hasbeen instructed to refer to London for authority if circumstances permit; and, ifthis is not possible, to report the action taken without delay. He has also been requested in either case to keep the Commonwealth and New Zealand Govern-ments fully informed.Reports on Particular Colonies. .(23) Palestine.Apart from the sensation caused by the murder in Bagdad of FakhriNashashibi (the moderate Arab leader), local Arab politics remained quiescentduring the month. There have been rumours of reprisals for the murder, butthere are no grounds for supposing that they are well-founded. The majority of arabs of all parties realise that the attack on Fakhri Nashashibi was the outcome of personal rather than political motives in the broad sense, as he had fallen into disrepute even with his own party.: Government action to check profiteering and the rise in the cost of living,which has been a matter of anxiety to all communities, has been widelyappreciated.: The main political interest among the Jews during the month has been theJewish Agency&apos;s appeal for recruits. The appeal laid great stress on the need formaximum enlistment in the Jews&apos; own interests. In spite of this there has been no material improvement in the intake of recruits. Fair numbers, especially of arabs, have offered themselves, hut many had to be rejected on medical or other grounds.(24) Hong Kong.On the 29th October a Japanese soldier in the land frontier of the Colonyfired shots into British territory at three Chinese driving cattle across the frontier and seriously wounded a fourth Chinese working in a field nearby.On the 5th November a Japanese naval reconnaissance aircraft flew directlyover the fortifications at Stanley on the south of Hong Kong Island.In both cases protests were made to the J apanese Government in Tokyo andto the Japanese military authorities at Canton.(25) Sarawak.The Supplementary Agreement with the Government of Sarawak providingfor the appointment of a British Representative in the State has been signed at singapore, but the Rajah asked that the Agreement shall not be published nor theBritish Representative appointed until he himself returns to the State early nextyear from a visit to Australia. :
(26) Malta.The Malta Government found it necessary to make proposals for extensivelysubsidising certain basic food-stuffs in order to reduce the cost of living which,as compared with August 1939, had increased by 105 per cent, for food only and96 per cent, for all items. The subsidies will cost about  550,000 a year. Apartfrom these subsidies it is clear that the financial assistance which the malta government will require from United Kingdom funds will be in the neighbour-hood of  1,500,000 in respect of the current financial year.There has been a rather greater number of air raids during November, butfull details are not yet available. There is no reason to suppose that substantialdamage has been clone. Amongst other defence measures which have beenapproved is one to establish an underground flour mill in Malta capable of supplying the needs of the whole population (civil, military and naval). an expert has been sent to Malta to draw up the final plans, and it is hoped that the mill may be installed in the course of the next twelve months.(27) Cyprus.Mr. Woolley, the new Governor of Cyprus, assumed the administrationduring November.On the 15th November the Greek Prime Minister made a speech at a lunchin London in which he used language suggesting that Cyprus would be handedover to Greece after the war. A report of the speech was broadcast in the B.B.C.Greek broadcasts and caused considerable excitement in Cyprus. It was assumed that a statement of this kind would not be made without the knowledge and consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Enosist party, which favours union with Greece, were much encouraged. The Turkish Cypriots, on the other hand,were moved to express their opposition to union with Greece, and protests were received from them.The Greek Prime Minister&apos;s reference to Cyprus was entirely unauthorised,and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who saw him on the 25thNovember,made it clear that it was unwelcome to His Majesty&apos;s Government. An official statement has been issued in Cyprus indicating that no negotiations are or havebeen in progress with the Greek Government regarding the status of Cyprus, andthat the question of the transfer of Cyprus to Greece is not therefore underconsideration. This statement has, according to reports, served to allay publicexcitement.(28) Mauritius.The ex-Shah of Persia arrived in Mauritius durifrg November with a party of about twenty persons.
