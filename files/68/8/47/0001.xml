(4l)40).Further negotiations between the tivo side:; of the Mining Industry led to theacceptance of modified conditions for the &quot;Attendance Bonus&quot; early in the month bythe Executive Committee of the MineworkersFederation, though some hostility tothe principle of the bonus remained in certain colliery districts.   Meanwhileenergetic steps have been taken under the general direction of the Coal production council to stimulate output.    In this connection special mention should be madeof the services now being rendered by Admiral Sir Edward Evans in addressingnumerous meetings that arc being arranged in the colliery districts.After the low figure for Yfnitweek, there seamed to be evidence that outputhad at last taken a definite upward turn, but the last week of the month was again disappointing.   Holidays are now the disturbing factor, efforts to limitsummer holidays in the mining industry to not more than two days having largelyfailed.   This is perhaps not surprising in view of the unqualified officialexhortation to industry generally to take a week&apos;s holiday, especially as many inthe industry hold that normal holidays would increase output in&apos;the long run.On the 4th March last I put before the Lord President&apos;s Coal Committee mydefinite conclusion that only a substantial increase, of man-power could give the desired output.   I have pressed that view again and again as the experience ofmonth after month has brought added confirmation.    The fall in man-power hasindeed been checked but there has boon no increase as yet.   Eventually on the23rd June a broadcast appeal was made by the Minister of Labour and NationalService for the return of 50,000 ex-mincrs to the industry and a few days later a.complete embargo for four weeks was placed on further recruiting from the industry for the Forces.   The voluntary appeal has completely failed and the Minister hasnow given to his Divisional Officers,instructions to &quot;direct&quot; 25,000 suitable men,mainly coal-getters and timber men to return to specified, mining employment.Arrangements have been made for the District Production Committees to give allpossible help in the placing of the men.Even if this number is obtained and at v/ork before the end of July - and,unless they are, the outlook for next winter will rapidly increase in gravity -it is now too late to hope to achieve anything like the original programme of 4th March,   Half the stocking season has passed and the deficit on that programme is now over 5.5 million tons.   In a memorandum dated the 24th June the MinesDepartment submitted to the Lord President&apos;s Committee a reduced programme ofstocking.   This proceeded on the assumption that transport facilities next wintercould be counted, on to be no worse than last winter and that consumption incertain categories could bo reduced.    In particular the Department asked for authority(1) to start a campaign for the maximum economy in the use, not only of coal and coke, but of gas and electricity as wcll*
(2)   to introduce restrictions on the deliveries of coal and. coke to non-industrial premises during the summer months, these being devised not a? ^a general ration on consumption but to prevent the accumulation of excessive stocks by fortunately placed individuals and so to secure thebest distribution of the stocks of house coal;(3)    to prepare a rationing scheme, to cover coal, coke, gas and electricity,for introduction at 0. later date should this be decried necessary.This authority was duly given and the restrictions on deliveries becameoperative as from the beginidng of July.   A distinction is made for this purposebetween areas which supply their own domestic coal needs end the remainder or&quot;importing&quot; areas.   In the &quot;self-supplying&quot; areas deliveries may normally only beras.de to consumers having less than 2 tons of coal or coke in stock and then only at the rate of 1 ton a month.   In the importing areas a consumer ma;/ continue todraw coke (or other boiler fuel) even though he has over 2 tons of coal in stock,but not if he has more than a ton of coke..   Here again the limit on the totaldeliveries of coal and coke each month is 1 ton.    Local Pucl Overseers have full authority to issue licences for larger supplies in individual cases as far as maybe needed to prevent hardship.Mine accidents have shown a disturbing incrce.se since the outbreak of war,and, although sriccial steps have been and arc being taken to try and check this increase, the toted of 102 killed at mines and quarries during June is 3C b abovethe recent average and AO70 above the pre-war average for a four-weekly period.More than half of this current increase is due, however,, to .15 deaths in the explosion at William Pit, Whitehe-vcn, on 3rd June.    In the first half of 1941 the:have.been 495 deaths, the same number as in the first half of 1940, compared with about 450 as the pre-war average for six months.The usual statistical tables are attached with an additional one showingcoke stocks.   The average stock position in regard to electricity and&quot;water undertakings is satisfactory (though a few cases still need attention) but the stocks of gas companies arc over 1 million tons down on last yearns-&quot;figures,A special committee of the Conjoint Conference of Public Utility Associations hasbeen appointed recently by the President of the Board of. Trade to co-operate withthe Mines Department in securing&apos;the best distribution of available supplies.D.R.G.
