(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMBM)copy no.    ij-fw a rca bin et.Notifications of Infectious Diseases.Note by the Minister of Health.Since a return of the notifications of the principal infectious diseases was last circulated (w. P. (R) (4-1) 33, 8th May, 1941) there has &quot;been little change on which to comment, except that a continuous fall is nowapparent in the incidence of measles.The periodical returns of the incidence of tuberculosis which i made earlier in the year were obtained from local authorities as a specialmeasure, at the cost of some labour.     They have been in my view of little value as a guide to the trend of tuberculosis, which is slower in development and more persistent than the diseases included in this return.I propose, therefore, to make a quarterly statement of tuberculosisnotifications at the appropriate time.I circulate herewith for information a return of notifications of infectious diseases, excluding tuberculosis, during October, 194-1.e.b.secret. P. (R) (4-1) 66.14th November, 194-1.Ministry of Health.14th November, .194-1,*
