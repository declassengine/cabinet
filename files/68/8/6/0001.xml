GOAL POSITION.Report by the Secretary for Mines.No.  26   covering&apos; Deqember, 1940..iro^ilctionj,The Christmas holidays accounted for a decrease in output ofsome 1-f million tons, equivalent to the normal decline in peacetime,ut soine 250,000 tons less than the corresponding decline last year.Table i).    This loss has inevitably had an adverse effect upon theupply situation and has temporarily accentuated the shortages in the London and Southern Divisions, as well as increased the withdrawalrom stocks in most parts of the country,EMPLOYMENT.The numbers of employed at the pits have further declined, due[gain, in the main, to trade difficulties in Durham and South Wales,though wagon shortages have been responsible for some decrease in thejidlands district (Table II).    The time worked at pits was ratherletter in December than in November, except for the decreaselecasioned by the Christmas holidays (Table III).3REASE IN CONSUMPTION.This month has been marked by the onset of severe weatherrich must inevitably speedily show its effect in a sharp increasef consumption of coal both by public utility undertakings and alsodomestic consumers.DISTRIBUTION.    &quot;The problem of distribution remains most acute in London souththe Thames and in the 3 southern Divisions.    Measures initiated bye Lord President of the Council as Chairman of the Committee onCorl Supplies, to meet the deficiency of supplies in these areas haveft-ready been reported by him to the War Cabinet (W.P. (g) (-1-0)328).Those measures had not had time to affect appreciably the figuresof deliveries shown in this report (Table TV).    Fresh steps arejBder consideration by which it may be possible to ease further theauPply situation in these areas by increasing the deliveries by rail.stocks.C&apos;fe) General^   There has been a general decline in distributed stocksRth the exception of Government dumps which have again increased.able V).    Although stocks normally declined at this time of year,e off-take is greater than usual and will continue to be so untilrr-ent deliveries are brought nearer to requirements for current8nsum.pt ion.&apos;&apos;vth&apos;B1) Merchants.   Merchants&apos; stocks have again declined, their receiptsId disposals being slightly higher than in the previous  weeksableVI).   Disposals were higher also than a year ago.    The positionmost difficult in the south of England, where merchants   stockopresent only a fortnight&apos;s supply at the current rate of disposals.Public Utilities.    The aggregate stocks of gas and electricitylertlkingi are still substantially higher than they were a year afeble VII), but gas stocks have declined over the month by theiivalent of one week&apos;s supply   as compared with half a week a yearElectricity stocks on the other hand have fallen atpoximately the same rate for both periods, i.e. by the equivalentIf a week&apos;s supply.    While the general position is notitisfactory the drain has been very marked in the Southern-sions, and in some areas stocks are now at a dangerously low-si.go
(d) Government.    The present situation in regard to government stocks is as follows:-Sites available 554Capacity 3,561,000 tonsCoal stocked to date       764,000   &quot;During the next two months v/hen the demand for coal for current consumption will &quot;be at a maximum, it will be necessary to divertto current needs supplies hitherto ear-marked for the dumps andalso to draw upon these reserves where acute shortages develop.WAR LEVY SCHEME.Following an affirmative resolution by &quot;both Houses of Parliamer;the necessary amendments to the Central (Coal Mines) Scheme,. 1930, -previously approved, in principle, &quot;by the Economic Policy Committee(E.P. (M.)(40) 23rd Meeting) - have &quot;been made, &quot;by which the War LevyScheme is put into operation.    This provides for the imposition ofa levy not exceeding 6d. a ton on all coal sold &quot;by each district andfor payments from the fund thus created to collieries which have suffered exceptional loss of trade as a result of war.    The objectof the scheme is to ensure, as far as possible, the conservation ofthe main capital assets of the coal mining industry in wartime.    Forthe present a rate of levy of 3d. per ton and compensation on a basisof 2/6d. per ton of lost shares of trade, compared with thecorresponding quarter of 1939, have been fixed by the colliery owner:PITHEAD PRICES.With the approval of the Economic Policy Committee (E.P.(M)(4C)26th Meeting) an increase of 8d. per ton in the pithead price of cos&apos;was authorised, to operate from 1st January, to offset increased cos&apos;of production arising from a wage advance (due under an agreementbetween the colliery owners and the miners) and the need to providefor the levy scheme. There have also been increases in the price of coke, reflecting this increase and certain previous&apos; increases in theprice of coal and other factors,EXPORTS.The slow upward trend in production costs supervening upon thegreat increase of shipping freights is making it very difficult tomaintain even the limited export trade with North and South Americafor which shipping is available.    The loss of this trade would tendto aggravate the unemployment position in exporting districts.whichare already suffering severe losses.   Moreover, much.of the coalexported is large screened steam, for which there is at present nomarket in this country:    its production enables substantial quantities of sized coals, which are in demand, to be producedsimultaneously.    This trade is of&apos;great value both as providingforeign exchange and as keeping down freights by providing returncargoes and the question whether some form of subsidy should beprovided is under consideration.
