The,shortage of road vehicles persists^     The pooling of insulated road and rail vehicles is iroi-king satisfactorily.     labour shortage for unloading is one of the principal obstacles to the rapid turn-round of ships.
II   COMLDDITY SUPPLY POSITIONENERGY FOODS        Y/heat stocks are falling rapidly;    sugar stocks are passingtheir seasonal peak;   potatoes remain in ample supply.Yfaeat &amp; flour - By end-llarch reserve stocks of wheat and flour are likely to fall below 13 weeks&apos;supply.     This is due to(a) low arrivals;(b) unexpectedly heavy utilisation of1940 hone wheat crop for animal feed.Thf.s must bo considered in relation to aprospective increase in consumption of bread owing to shortage of other foods.Priority will be given to imports duringthe spring and summer months in an attemptto raise reserve stocks to 15 weeks&apos; supplyby the end of June and to maintain themabove 13 weeks&apos; supply during July and ijigust.PROTEINFOODS,Sugar   - Imports during the first four months of the2nd war year were at the rate of 1,254,000 tons per annum. If forecasts for January and february are realised imports during the second half of the year will have to be at the rate of1,616,000 tons per annum (plus replacements ofair raid losses) in order to. fulfil the revisedimport programme.Potatoes   -        Quantities sold by farmers in November 1940were less than in November 1939;   but thereis probably increased consumption from gardensand allotments.Animal protein foods, already hard&apos;hit, are barely holding theirMeat -      The ration is at present varied weekly in relation to supplies, and it is hoped to maintain stocks at 40 to50,000 tons (about three weeks&apos; supply at current rateof consumption of imported meat).     The future positicJlis dependent on the availability of refrigerated tonr^fBaoon - Following the introduction of the rationing of feeding&apos;stuffs on 1 st February, heavy pig marketings are expectation;and bacon factories should be working to full capacity.In recent weeks imports have been well up to program)and stocks have been increased slightly.PROTECTIVEFOODS.Fish - Canned Salmon allocations continue at 60$ of pre-warnormal. At this rate, stocks at end-December wouldlast 6 months.Cheese -   Total stocks at end-January are put at 10,000 tons(2^-weeks&apos; normal consumption). Present allocation &amp;&quot;5Of0 pre-war quantities will probably be reduced to ab^40$ during February-March.Protective foods, other than vegetables, are in short supply.FreshFruit   -CannedFruitQuantities available (mainly oranges) in the first h^iof 1941 will be less than 2Of0 of the normal consumptifof fresh fruit.At&apos;present consumption (about 12 thousand tons a montijbulk stocks of canned fruit would last for the first5 months of 1941.
Dried        13 thousand tons of U.S.A. sultanas should arrive beforeFruit        end-February;    26 thousand tons of dried fruit from greece and Turkey are not likely to arrive before .April.     It isproposed to issue 10 thousand tons a month, beingtwo-thirds of pre-war normal.     Issue for January was.5 thousand tons (mostly dates).Eggs End-December total stocks of eggs in shell were down to half a week&apos;s supply.     During the first, six months of1941 it is not expected that there will be anyaccumulation of stock.BillionFresh gallonsI i!lk         Milk production in December 1940 was......... 83November 1940.............. 82.December 1939 .............. 87Milk production during 4 months January-Ipril1941 is estimated at......................... 530(26 million gallons down on 1940:53    V &quot; &quot;     &quot;   1939)during 4 months May-August 1941 at............        445(40 million gallons down on 1.940;70    K &quot;     &quot;   1939) -Butter   - There was a slight increase in stocks during the early partof January, but the shortage is still acute.Margarine - As an insurance against the loss of producing plant anincreased reserve t)f margarine is required.     Such anincrease could be secured only by reducing current consumption.     But without an increase in the butterallowance a reduction of margarine consumption wouldresult in an insufficient intake of fats.VegetableOils -    &quot; Soft oil stocks are expected to increase from 7? weeks1supply (end-December) to 12-15 weeks1 supply (end-March).Stocks of hard oils and of linseed are expected to fallfrom 12 weeks to 9 weeks! supply during the same period..Tea   -      Stocks are expected to reach their seasonal normal by theend of March.     Owing to shipping delays, the seasonalpeak may not be reached until June.     Although stockswill fall after.June they will be sufficient to ensurethe maintenance of the present ration.Animal      Returns of stocks on -farms made by farmers on December 4thFeeds        showed a rapid disappearance of hone-grown cereals sinceharvest.     If these returns prove substantially accurateit may be necessary to devalue (under the rationing scheme which commences 1st February) the cereal couponbefore the grazing season.Ill   DISTRIBUTIONOver the last three months of 1940 the Retail Food Price Indexflattened out at a level 23% higher than at the beginning of the war.The average increase from September 1939 to 30th November 1940 inthe price of 21 foods not included in the Index was 44^.
