MONTHLY REPORT.During May the economic war in the countries., adjacent to -German Europe, especially French North Africa, Syria, turkey and Finland, reflected the increased effect of German politicaland military pressure.       In the Far East the economic strugglev/ith Japan,increased in intensity.    -The participation of theU.S.A. in economic war showed a further welcome advance.- .&apos;   [The-terms of the proposed economic agreement betweenU.S.A. and French North Africa reached London early in the month and were.generally satisfactory.     They contained provisions -against: re-export, provisions for controlling import by means of u.S.. observers, and other safeguards.     The only disputed pointv,-as that,-the-French had still; not agreed to the-&apos;condition ,imposed by us, - and. now-supported by U.S.A., that no French ships, - in american waters&apos; should be .used for the trade, , - -   -   -.But on May 15th, increased collaboration between Vichyand-Germany was announced;    this was followed immediately by the landing&quot; of-German aeroplanes in&quot;Syria.     Negotiations were -therefore suspended,   v The U.S. Government placed guards on french ships&apos;in U.S. harbours,&apos;established strict control over., the .sailing of U.S. ships&quot;to French colonies and encouraged&apos; H.Mv,Government to intercept the tanker Schehe-rezade., . which was alreadyen route for North Africa.--!. . * . jBy the end of the month, however,&apos;after&apos; General Yeygand&apos;visit to Vichy, the U.S. Government was again inclining to. theview that it&quot;was&apos; worth extending economic support to French north africa-,, and negotiations were/being resumed.     Meantime, Syriahad been declared an enemy-controlled territory and consequentlynegotiations for/the purchase of Syrian wool and for the supply ofPalestine1s:requirements from Syria had necessarily been broken off...-; ;--&apos;- -   -* :;o - . -&apos;. -  &apos; -&apos; \ :? : . &apos;. ,&apos;i&apos;f;&apos;: - :;u&quot;&quot;&apos;   - - &quot;  &apos; The conquest of Crete and the control, of the Aegean by theSnemy will,  it is feared, seriously affect our. efforts to restrictoil-imports&apos;-from&apos;Roumania and Russia/     Enemy tankers-have alreadybeen,.reported using the sea, route from the Black Sea and it canonly^bV/hpped that&apos; the Navy will be successful in talcing .al sub- -stantia! :toll of such ships. &apos;.        &apos;  ,    ;     .&quot;&quot; &quot; &quot;    ;   -Turkey&apos;s increased anxiety showed itself in reluctance toallow her ships to be. chartered for^moving British stocks -of. .chrome- or&apos;:to proceed v/ith any. other of our pending negotiations.Our. own&apos;polic3r towards Turkey was modified, - its objects being toremove&quot; our-own existing&apos; stocks&apos; and to prevent Turkey increasing-&apos;her stocks , &quot;whilst. &apos;fu-rhish&apos;ihg-;&quot;heT so far as&apos;possible with military requirements-and essential civil supplies--.&apos;     The shortage of  -shipping fac&apos;ilities-;between Egypt and Turkey has restricted sub-staritial movement of goods, -&apos;.;.,  ,: .The^Inc&apos;rease .of enemy, influence in&apos; Finland- has been.; re-ilccted&apos; by various incidents&apos;and in. particular&apos;by the continuedfailure of the Finns.to reply to our proposal for the chartering of-Finnish ships.     At the end of the month Finland was formallynotified, that .unless an answer to this request was receivedv/ithih, seven days&apos; we. should have to reconsider Finnish quotas,.In the Far East our policy of economic restrictionagainst Japan has been intensified, despite Japanese complaints. -;The fleets of four.-Japanese whaling companies.-have been- re-   \  ; .commended for the Statutory, List, exports of rubber and tin from.&apos; ,-v, ! , f       &quot; s &apos;     &apos;        &apos;-&apos;;&apos;&quot; &apos; &apos;. 4 Malaya.&apos;
Malaya to Japan have teen stopped, and other restrictions have beenor will be imposed.Meantime,  the Japanese have continued their commercialpressure on Indb-China, Thailand and N,E.&apos;I.      It has not beenpossible to interfere seriously with their economic plans in Indo-China.      In Thailand H.M. Government, by agreeing to supply oil,has secured about a third of Thailand&apos;s output of rubber..     InN.E.I., Japan&apos;s ambitious economic negotiations have reached a deadlock.The increase in U.S. co-operation has again been largely in the field of export control and supply.      Export control hasbeen extended to the Philippines, the Canal zone and all U.S. &apos;.possessions, a welcome advance towards controlling the flow of products from the Philippines to Germany and Japan.      With the aid of U,S. influence, exports to.Russia including some emanating from south America have been further curtailed.     An extensive U.S.programme for buying the strategic materials of. South America hasbeen approved and brought into effect.     H.M. Government&apos;s policy for pre-emption In South America has been explained to Washingtonfor discussion with the U.S. Government and it is hoped &quot;that itmay be co-ordinated with the much larger American purchasing .&apos;..programme.      The latter has already had some important pre-emptiveeffects,  especially as regards wolfram in Bolivia and&apos;the Argentine.On the other hand, no progress has been made, in obtainingU.S. consent to interception in the Caribbean or in obtaining U.S.assistance in interrupting the legislation air line.The weapons for enforcing and supplementing the blockadehave been further developed in a number of details.    - During.themonth 28 further owners applied for Ship Warrants in respect of 87ships, -    Progress was made in extending warrant-holders&apos; obliga-tions so as to control the use of their tugs, to eliminate pbjec-tionable members of their crews and to discourage the smuggling ofparcels and mail.      Stricter -regulations for controlling passengerson navicerted ships (other than diplomatic passengers, regardingwhom discussions with the Foreign Office are still proceeding)have been issued.     A new Defence Regulation has been agreed whichwill enable us further to restrict the export of notes andsecurities from Europe.There was some successful.-blockade running during themonth by enemy ships;    one, the Lech, was subsequently intercepted.There were nine successful interceptions of &quot;French ships.1?th June, 1941*
