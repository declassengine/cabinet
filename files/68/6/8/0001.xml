April 23, 1940/This Analysis of German Propaganda covers the period from the1st to the 15th April.The ararngement follows the same lines as the previous Analyses. german propaganda is divided into a number of themes designed to provide bases forcomparison.Firstly, a short summary is made of the main trends of propaganda during the past fortnight.A brief description is then given of each of these themes. In the marginbeside the items are placed percentage figures showing their comparativeimportance in relation to the total propaganda directed to (1) the Germanhome population; (2) Great Britain; (3) France; and (4.) the neutral countries.In brackets after each figure is placed the corresponding percentage for theprevious fortnight.A table is then given summarising these percentages.Finally, in an Appendix, there is given a rough English translation ofthe words of the new popular song &quot; Bomben auf Engelland &quot; from the propaganda film &quot; Feuertaufe,&quot; depicting the aerial bombardment of Poland.This film was first shown on the 15th April.The order of importance of the main lines of propaganda during the part fortnight were : 1. Military Operations and2. British Brutality.3. British Weakness. ,4. German Strength.German propaganda during the second half of the past fortnight was naturally dominated by the invasion of Denmark and Norway. This led to anincrease in Military Operations and German Strength at the expense of theother themes.10813-8   [21185] B
During the first half of the fortnight the general pattern of propagandafollowed a design which had been evolved since the 24th March, a few days after the Brenner meeting. German Strength had risen steadily, at theexpense of British and French Weakness, while the general theme of A HiedU nscrupulousness and Mendacity had been maintained at a consistently high level.Two other interesting developments have also been noticed since the brenner meeting. There has been a marked increase in the stress laid uponthe &quot; total preparation &quot; of Italy, and her readiness to enter the war on theGerman side. Great Britain has been warned that, if the bombing of therailway station in Schleswig-Holstein is repeated. Germany would draw thenecessary consequences.1. German Strength.Germany, 23j% There has been a striking increase in this theme, in propaganda to theo    -   ,010, home population, since the 24th March.   This increase was not reflectedBritain, 121 % (13%) . 1   1       ,France, 11% (13%)   in propaganda to other countries.Neutrals, 13% (16%) The sub-theme of Military Strength (apart from active MilitaryOperations), which for some days before the invasion of Denmark and norway had been increasing rapidly, was much the most important topic in propaganda to all countries. Before the invasion most stress was laid onthe striking power of the German air-force, and, to a lesser extent, on thestrength of the West Wall. After the 8th April, attention was concentrated upon the invasion. The lightning occupation of Denmark and Norway wasadvertised as the most brilliant action in history, and it was pointed out thatthese new bases gave increased striking power to the German air-force.Germany had eliminated the menace to her northern flank and, in forestallingAllied aggression by only ten hours, had turned the tables on the plotters.Germany had once more shown that the initiative always remained in herhands.Second in importance, except in propaganda to France, was emphasisupon the support of Germany&apos;s friends and of the neutrals. Since the brenner meeting greatly increased stress has been laid upon Italiansympathy and admiration for the German cause, and upon her armed might.The support of Hungary and, to a lesser extent, Spain was given considerableprominence. The visit of Herr Darre to Budapest was exploited almost asa major event.The economic, social and political strength of Germany receivedcomparatively little attention. It was pointed out. however, that Germany&apos;simmunity to the blockade, already safeguarded by her friendship with Russiaand the Balkan countries, had been greatly strengthened by her occupationof Denmark and Norway.Germany. 21 &apos;Britain, I5i%Franco. 15J% (7%)Neutrals, 24%(12*%)2. Military Operations.This theme has reached its highest level since the fall of Poland. It has,as usual, been given much greater prominence in pi&quot;opaganda to Germany(ioj%) and to the neutrals than to the Allies. Before the invasion the main stresswas laid upon the destruction of Allied aeroplanes, German reconnaissance flights over France and Britain, and air attacks upon British ships. Afterthe 8th April reports of the triumphant progress of the invasion occupiedover one-third of the total propaganda for home consumption. approximately equal attention was paid to the military occupation of Denmark and norway and to British defeats on sea and in the air. The whole operation was treated as a triumphant and almost unimpeded progress, carried out accordingto a predetermined plan.3.

4. British Weakness.This theme, despite a temporary rise immediately after the invasion of Scandinavia, has declined in importance ever since the Brenner meeting.Military weakness, except in propaganda to Great Britain, was much the most important topic. The occupation of Denmark and Norwayconstituted a decisive defeat for the Western Powers. Even the English were asking, with reason: &quot; Where was the British Navy? &quot; The vulnerabilityof Great Britain, especially of her naval bases and industrial districts, had greatly increased. Panic reigned in Scotland. The Allies, as a sign of theirdesperate position, had attempted to extend the war and had been defeated.Economic weakness, in propaganda to Great Britain, was scarcely less important than military weakness. The occupation of Scandinavia haddeprived Great Britain of food-stuffs, iron ore, timber and wood pulp. she had lost one of her best markets for coal and cotton. Attention&apos; was alsopaid to the weakness of sterling and to the loss of foreign currency.Propaganda stressing her social and political weakness was of seriousimportance only in propaganda to Great Britain. The reshuffle of theCabinet of no talents had not strengthened the British Government, but hadmerely resulted in a triumph for Mr. Winston Churchill. The real social problems which beset Great Britain had not been touched. Unemployment,war profiteering and rising prices still continued unchecked.Special attention was paid to the sufferings of the Welsh, a people asdifferent from the English as the Czechs and Poles were different from theGerman. &quot;Anyone who has heard 80,000 Welshmen singing &quot;Land ofMy Fathers&apos; knows what a spirit these people have. Will that spirit be broken in grinding poverty, or will it burst forth in revolt?&quot;German v, 12$ %(181%)Britain, 23$ %(301%)France, 14*% (16%1Neutrals, il%(20i%)5. French Weakness.This theme, like that of British weakness, has declined considerably in Germany, 3% (5*%)importance during the last fortnights ?!S&apos;&amp;^nv$By far the most important, and to Germany the only, topic has been Neutrals, 4i% (8*%)France&apos;s military weakness, largely as a reflection of similar attacks against great Britain.   The extension of the war meant that France could no longerhope for British reinforcements.   The Allied forces had been severed.   for france this was a measure of despair.Some reference was also made to France&apos;s political weakness in propaganda to France and to Great Britain. The main topic was theinsecurity of the Reynaud Ministry, due to the Radical-Socialist opposition and to the general criticism of the Norwegian venture. Defeatism and anti-war agitation were on the increase.(19%)6. British Brutality and Unscrupulousness.This theme has remained approximately steady to Germany and has Germany, 19%increased in propaganda to other countries.   The emphasis has shifted from Britam 19% (15*%.)violation of neutral rights, on which it was laid during the previous fortnight, France,&apos; io* % (14*%)to the Allied determination to involve the neutrals in the war. Neutrals, 2i*&quot;The most important charge has been that Great Britain had alreadydestroyed the neutrality of Norway before Germany decided to intervene.The German Foreign Minister had produced documentary proof of theAllied intention to occupy Norway. This was confirmed by the capture offive British munition transports at Bergen, and by the discovery of secret service agents in all Norwegian ports. &apos;&apos; The crime committed on the 8thApril by Great Britain will never be forgotten by humanity : it will beremembered when peace comes and the nations have got rid of England.&quot;The general charge was continually made that Great Britain was determined to extend the war and the blockade, at any cost. She wagedwar against the neutrals, at the cost of the neutrals, and yoked them to bleedfor British Imperialism. The Government, led by Mr. Winston Churchill,have made the violation of neutral countries the mainstay of their policy.It is interesting to note that the charge of involving the Balkans in thewar was made much more frequently than similar charges about theNetherlands.[21185] b 2
On the day of the invasion of Denmark the main story in the german press was the attempt of the British Secret Service to sabotage the traffic onthe Danube. Britain would thus stop at nothing in her determination toextend the war.Two atrocity stories have been used to justify the threat of the possibleaerial bombardment of England. The first of these was the charge thatBritish aircraft had bombed a railway station in Schleswig-Holstein. Eye-witness accounts established that bomb fragments had broken severalwindows, and had been found under a lady&apos;s bed. Germany would know how to draw the necessary conclusions from this violation of the rules of aerialwarfare. The second charge was the British bombardment of the open town-   of Bergen.The British victory at Narvik was masked by a description of the gallantGerman fight against overwhelming odds, by the &quot; German revenge inflicted on the murder-ship Cossack.&quot; and by the story of the inhuman machine-gunning of helpless German sailors in the waters of the Narvik Fjord. this last atrocity was said to demand expiation which would duly be exacted.7. French Brutality and Unscrupulousness.German.\y7% uj%)        The increase in this theme has been entirely due to the coupling ofFrance&apos;&apos;io% m%\   France with Great Britain in a common desire to extend the war.   the neutrals, 9% (4i%)   charges are merely a reflection of those made against Great Britain.Amongst other points were the stopping of Portuguese ships by French warships in the Brazilian waters of the River Amazon, and the cynicalbrutality of M. Monnet in declaring that it did not matter whether women and children starved as a result of the intensified blockade.8. Britain Lies.Germany, 3i% (io%)        This theme has been swamped by the military aspects of the invasion ofFrance&apos; 4% (6%)     Scandinavia.   The main items have been concerned with denunciations neutrals, 4i% (6j%) false reports of British troop landings and naval victories intended tobolster up Allied morale, encourage the Norwegians, or promote financialspeculation.    The premature  report of  the recapture of Bergen andTrondheim was the biggest single item in the charge.The German treatment of the actions at Narvik was particularlyinteresting. The destruction of the seven German destroyers was the firstreverse suffered by Germany which has not been immediately denied. It was at first suppressed, and later masked, as was the Graf Spee action, as agallant battle fought against overwhelming odds.Among other lies exposed were British statements about the food and health position in Germany, and about the persecution of the GermanChurches.9. France Lies.Germany, 1% (i%) The most important item in this theme, accounting for the slight rise toFrance&apos;lj% (5*) Britain and to neutral countries, was the refutation of the &quot; pitiful FrenchNeutrals&quot; 1J% 11%)  attempts to explain away the Reynaud map.&quot;The French press and radio, and particularly the Havas agency, sharedwith Britain the responsibility for spreading- false reports about the campaign in Scandinavia.10.

The eternal Richelieu was still dreaming of aneternal Westphalia, a dismembered Germany in a Balkanised Europe.This map was employed to whip up indignation in Italy, who would loseher northern provinces to Austria, in Hungary, who would be treated as aneoro colony, and in Roumania, who would be again subjected to theHapsburgs.12.

Reynaud is the nominee of Jewish interests.These sixteen themes constitute the main lines of German propaganda.The following individual points, however, deserve mention :  said of the anger shown by Americans at thethe German White Book, and of their reinforcedto remain neutral.   The White Book itself was used to demonstrate the guilt of United States diplomatists evenmore than that of the Allies.(b) It was pointed out that both the Danes and the majority ofNorwegians were grateful to Germany for having saved them from the horrors of war.
