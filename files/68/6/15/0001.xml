IMPORTS.Imports during the early months of the war were much belowcurrent consumption.     Prom the end of November a substantial improvement was effected and since then imports have on theaverage been sufficient to meet current needs.During the past two or three weeks imports have fallensomewhat but the forward position indicates that this is likelyto be a temporary reduction only.     Assuming that a satisfactory arrangement is concluded regarding the use of Norwegian tankersit should be possible to maintain imports at a figure somewhatin excess of current consumption.     The programme for May loadingsfor the United Kingdom submitted to the Shinoing ExecutiveCommittee aims at an import of 1.3 million tons.CONSUMPTION,There has been some increase in the figures of consumption in recent weeks due mainly to a greater consumption for military purposes.The higher figure of consumption of motor spirit (Civil)during last week was stated &quot;by the Petroleum Board to he due tobuying bjr the retail trade against a possible increase of tax onpetrol in the budget.STOCKS,(a) Services.Apart from the substantial fall in stocks of Admiraltyoil which occurred in the first two months of the war therefuelhasoeen no material change.     While it was always contemplated thatthe Admiralty would draw on stocks during the early months ofwar, the   decrease  is now at a greatly reduced rate.     The WarOffice and Air Ministry have improved their stocks position sincethe outbreak of war.(b) Civil.Civil stocks fell substantially between the outbreak of warand the end of February.     Since then there has been an improvement.The last two weeks have shown a recession which is explained inthe note on imports.     The stocks of heavy oils are   still lowertfian they ought to be but are expected gradually to improve overtie next two or three months.
