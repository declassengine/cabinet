General Sir Hugh Elles has been appointed Chief of theCivil Defence Operational Staff and took up his duties on the1st April,     He will be responsible for the training and-operational organisation of the Civil Defence services.Recording and Notification of Air Raid Casualties.2.      Circulars have recently been issued inviting localauthorities to make arrangements for securing that the relativesof persons killed or injured in air raids are informed as soonas may be possible, for answering individual enquiries locallyand for making available information about casualties.

damage caused on land and only slight casualties resulted fromthe raids.      The morale of the public in the Orkneys is excellent.It is stated that the population are now becoming war-wise and taking shelter whenever warnings are given.Civil Defence Services.4.     An Inter-Departmental Committee was appointed at thebeginning of the year, under the chairmanship of the parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Home Security, to review the structure of the Civil Defence Services and the conditions ofservice of Civil Defence personnel in the light of experiencesince the outbreak of the war.      The Committee has now reported and action on the recommendations made by the Committee is underconsideration.Air Raid Shelters.5.      The number of standard steel shelters which have been issued,including the present deliveries, is about 90 per cent of the revised estimated requirement, and will provide shelter for about11-5 million people.      The transfer of steel to other war purposesmeans that no more of these shelters can be supplied to localauthorities, but a wide range of alternative simple designs inbrick and concrete has already been issued, and the technical staff of the Department will help local authorities who will now have to fall back upon these substitute shelters.Other forms of public shelter are progressing steadily.      Inthe case of factories about 80 per. cent of the shelters whichwere estimated as necessary under the Civil Defence Act havealready been completed.     This represents shelter fcr about% - 3 million workpeople.Government Evacuation Scheme.6.      The response to registration in the evacuation areas and tothe enrolment of householders in the receiving areas has not

&quot;been large.In the evacuation areas in England and Scotland 114*500children have been registered for evacuation in the event ofair raids, &quot;but refusals from parents total 365,000 and noreplies have been received in respect of 932,000 children.In the reception areas the issue of a leaflet to house-holders inviting them to enrol as willing to care for childreneither now or in the event of raids has been supplemented by aseries of press advertisements over a period of six weeks, andlocal authorities are in many districts making personalapproaches to householders.      Up to the present information hasbeen received that only 49,500 householders have enrolled ofwhom approximately 32,500 are already caring for children.Provision of Huts for Emergency Hospitals Scheme.7.      Steady progress is being made with the completion andequipment of the first block of huts for emergency hospitalpurposes, accommodating approximately 36,000 beds.      About halfof these will be ready for occupation by the end of the month,and many of them are already occupied.      Plans for erecting afurther block of huts capable of accommodating between 10,000and 15,000 additonal beds are going ahead rapidly.Transport.8.     The position as regards both goods and passenger trafficby rail and road is generally satisfactory.      The additionalcoal trains which are being run from Northumberland and Durhamto London and the South still require a reduction in the long distance passenger services on the London and North EasternRailway.      The number of goods vehicles in use on the roads hasincreased and the longer hours of daylight have led to a more

This has resulted in a continued upward tendency in the amount of fuel rations issued.Recent events in Scandinavia have resulted in an influx of neutral ships into East Coast ports and ships loading out for Scandinavian ports are &quot;being held pending developments.No serious congestion of shipping or interference with portworking, however, has resulted,,Civil Defence Supplies,9.     With few exceptions the supply position is good.      Forexample, 24,700 pumping appliances for the emergency fire brigade programme have been received out of a total requirement of 26,856, 1,540,000 babies&apos; respirator helmets out of 1,680,000and the full complement of 2,800,000 steel helmets.
