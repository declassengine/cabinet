It is understood that in many casescargoes have already &quot;been delivered to buyers and removed from theirports of discharge.FINLAND2. The Finnish Government have informed His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat they will not now require any lorries from the United kingdom for the transport &quot;between Petsamo and Rovaniemi, as they have con-cluded an agreement with the Swedish Government for the supply ofthese lorries.BALTIC STATES3&quot; It is reported that the Soviet Government have now agreed toallow the Murmansk railway to he used for the transport of goodsbetween Murmansk and the Baltic States.ICELANDU. Imports of fish from Iceland&quot;continue on an undiminished scale.Arrangements have been made for the export of fish from Iceland toNigeria.    Assis.tan.ee has been given to the Icelandic Legation inLondon for the expert of goods to Iceland.FAROE ISLANDS5.

During the week the unloading of nearly all the Swedish&apos;vessels in United Kingdom ports was completed.      The goods unloadedhave, begun to move not unsatisfactorily.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed in principle (though subjectto settlement of points of detail; to the Swedish proposal to runtrial trips backwards and forwards to the United States through theKiel Canal,   i The Germans have, however, not yet agreed and the Swedesdo not seem very sanguine of their doing so.      A German refusal wouldbe satisfactory since it would avoid the necessity for our co-o.per-atioii in this difficult operation and would arouse feelings ofresentment towards the Germans in the Swedish mind.SWITZERLAND8. A recent investigation shews existing stocks of copper inSwitzerland to be excessive.     Steps are, therefore, being taken to stop the grant of further navicerts or export licences for thepresent.ITALY/

The question of a similar promise in regard to turpsatine is still under consideration but presents much greater difficulties-11, The coal-pitwood agreement was duly signed in Lisbon on June6th.     The text is not yet available.12, Mr. Eccles&apos; general negotiations have now reached a point atv/hich it is possible to contemplate an early approach to the quest!of a War Trade Agreement. Mr. Robertson of the Prize Department for Lisbon on June 11th to assist Mr, Eccles in this connexion and took, with him a memorandum setting forth in an up-to-date form ourdesiderata. These, however, must he regarded at the maximum of whwe should like to secure, as there are several points on v/hich it mbe difficult to get full satisfaction..BALKANS.13. All navicert-issuing posts have been instructed to bring intforce from the 1.5th June for Roumania, Greece and Yugoslavia the farationing procedure which has already been adopted in the case of hungary,GREECE;IL,       In reply, to the Greek request that, in order to enable themresist German pressure, we should increase our purchases of Greektobacco to  2 million (see last weekly summary), the-Greek Governmehave beer, informed that when the War Trade Agreement was negotiatedthe possibility of German pressure was recognised by the assurancegiven to them that, in the event of the severance cf commercial relations between Greece and Germany as the direct result of the aci by the Greek Government under.that Agreement, HJVLGovt.,and bheFrench Govt. would be ready to. examine the situation thus created.   if5Majesty&apos;s Government looked to the Greek Government to carry cut thprovisions of the War Trade Agreement and, although they did net fecalled upon to enter into discussion about the precise form and amovof the assistance to be given if the eventuality feared by the-Gr eelshould arise, the Greek Government could count upon the support ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government in accordance with the spirit of the assurance previously. given te. them.15. The Greek Government have now accepted all the suggestions ?&apos;&quot;forv/ard by His Majestyfs,Government for the quantities, of. goods to cimported into Greece under List B of the War Trade Agreement.ROjjmjilA,16,       The Roumanian Government have suggested that it would be more convenient for their own administration if the quota periods of the rationing agreement should begin on the first day of each quarter.It has accordingly been agreed that the preliminary period April andMay/
May should he lengthened hy one month -and&apos; the-first full quota periodhould begin on July 1st.NS..A, AND SOUTH AMERICA[7,        The Defence Bill pending in the Senate contains provisions tQ,permit the President in the interest of national defence to prohibit5r curtail the export of any military equipment or munitions ormachine tools or material necessary for the manufacture or servicing^hereof.      It is hoped that the licensing system for v/hich this bill provides will enable the United States Government to give the AlliesValuable help from the point of viev.r of economic warfare throughexport control.      II.M. Ambassador at Washington has been furnishedfrith a list of the commodities v/hich His Majesty1 s Government wouldLike to see fall under such export control.L8.       The despatch of representatives of the Ministry attached tothe staff of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Washington in order to develop;o-co-operation with the United States authorities in economic warfarequestions is under consideration.30LIVIA19.      A meeting was held on the 7th June to consider the presentposition of the tin industry in Bolivia, where tin concentrates of less than 50/b metal content, which formerly went to Holland andJermany for smelting, have been forced to find other markets, chieflyLn Japan and the U.S.A.     The trade with Japan is dangerous from theioint of view of contraband control, while that with the U.S.A.threatens the future of the British tin smelting industry, whichiepends on the use of Bolivian ores, but cannot absorb the whole out-put.     It was, therefore, suggested to.the meeting that new concen-ttration plants should, be put up in Bolivia to raise the grade of the[local ores to a lev^uywould enable them to be treated by the existingiritish smelting plants.[20,       It was agreed that this proposal should be examined in greaterietail, and that a first class engineer should be sent out toBolivia to examine the problem on the spot.JAPAN21.       A further conversation took place with the Counsellor of theJapanese Embassy at the Ministry of Economic Warfare on June 3rd.The Japanese Counsellor was informed that a preliminary study indic-Iated that it might be possible to go a long way towards meeting theJapanese requirements of raw materials from British Empire sources,although the supply position of the Allies would not allow commitmentsbeyond a few months at a time.      In the case of nickel,  tungsten,]:Zinc, lead,  scrap and pig iron, cobalt and copper, any supply wouldbe difficult owing to our armament requirements, though ores might beavailable.      Jute and bauxite would have to be discussed in the lightof Japan&apos;s exports of soya beans and aluminium.     As regards rubber and tin, information would be required regarding Japan&apos;s supplies from other sources, as the Japanese v/ere understood to have enquiredalso of the French and Netherlands East Indies Governments regardingraw materials.22.       The Japanese Counsellor maintained that his Government wereprepared to give a non re-export guarantee in respect of goods fromthe British Empire, but considered that it was their right, as a neutral, to trade with both sides and they could not contemplategiving guarantees to His Majesty&apos;s Government about imports from otherjcountries.      It was pointed out to him that the supply of BritishEmpire/
)- k -Empire produce to Japan must &quot;be dependent on the guarantees provideby Japan against the re-export to Germany of all important overseasimports on a list which had been handed to him.      If all overseasimports were covered &quot;By guarantees against re-export, we would not press for stringent restrictions as regards Japan&apos;s domestic producthough we hoped that some limitation might be possible,23.       An aide-memoire regarding our requirements was handed to theJapanese Counsellor suggesting the nature of the measures which migbe taken by the Japanese Government to prevent certain commodities from being forv/arded to Germany.IIContraband and Enemy Exports ControlCONTRABAND CONTROLStatistics2X\*       During the week ending 8th June, 20 new ships were dealt witby the Contraband Committee.      This is the lowest weekly figure sinethe beginning of the war.25.       16 advance copies of Manifests of cargoes were received and considered before the ship&apos;s arrival at Contraband Control Bases, an increase 2 such cases the ships concerned were released by the Committee,subject to the formal checking of the original manifests on their arrival at the Control Bases.      5 ships were allowed to carry forwacargo under Hold-back guarantees.26. For purposes of, comparison it may be mentioned that during thv/eek just preceding the iriVasion of Norway 120 new ships came beforethe Committee, of v/hich 88 were on advance manifests; while during tmonth between the invasion of Scandinavia and the invasion of the LoCountries the weekly average of fresh ships dealt with was lh and ofships dealt with in advance i+3.27. Navicert applications for the week totalled 827, a slightimprovement on the previous week&apos;s figure. Navicert applications dnot show nearly the same proportionate decline in numbers as do shipdealt with by the Contraband Committee.28.       During the week h fully navicerted ships were released.General Contraband Questions29. In view of the breakdown of economic warfare negotiations witItaly, and in view of the undesirability of facilitating the import-ation of war materials by a power which avowed her intention of enteiing the war on the&quot; side of the enemy, the immunity from contraband aienemy export control temporarily granted to Italian ships was with-drawn, two days before Italy announced her entry into the war.30.       Control was not re-introduced in its old form,     A list of essential war materials was drawn up and Italian ships carrying morethan a specified quantity of any one of these materials were to be detained.      In order to avoid congestion in bases, Italian ships carrying less than these specified quantities were to be releasedwithout reference to the Ministry of Economic Warfare.31.       In view of the departure of economic warfare staffs from our embassy and Consulates in Italy, the practices of asking for Destin-ation Undertakings, making consular enquiries into consignee firms,and granting permission to carry forv/ard goods to Italian ports underhold-back undertaking   were to be abandoned.     For these reasonsdetention of goods *for enquiry&apos; involving as it did the detention ofthe/
c- 5 -the ship at a base, could not reasonably be carried out for any length of time.     On the other hand, it appeared likely that therewould be great legal difficulties in the way of seizing certain goodsmerely because they were bound, for a ^re-belligerent&apos;.     From thisdilemma the Contraband Committee was saved by the Italian declarationof war,32.       As a result of the revocation of the immunity from control of italian ships, about a dozen Italian vessels, including severaltankers, were detained at Contraband Control Bases, and about nine at united Kingdom ports at the outbreak of war.     The s.s. &quot;Vulcania&quot;was brought into Gibraltar on the evening of 8th June.      Since she had 56O passengers on board and only one consignment of a listed,commodity in excess of the specified amount, she was subsequentlyreleased.33.       As a concession to Spanish susceptibilities, Contraband control bases were authorised to release without reference to the Ministryof Economic Warfare Spannish vessels carrying none of the listed war materials.     U.S.A. ships retained the immunity from control whichthey had previously shared with the Italian ships, though the UnitedStates Government were ready to accept the re-impositicn of control,3h0       Navicert Issuing Missions were instructed to refuse outstand-ing Navxcert applications for shipments to Italy of listed war materials, and to cancel such navicerts already issued.ENEMY EXPORT CONTROLStatistics35.       During the week ending 8th June, the Enemy Exports Committeereviewed k ships, directing that items should be placed in Prize inone case, deferring consideration in two cases and directing that one case should be dealt with departmentally in conjunction with the india Office.36.       The Committee considered 12 applications for exemption, grant-ing 1, refusing 6, and deferring consideration of 5.      In addition6 applications were dealt with summarily, 3 being refused and 3 beinggranted.General Enemy Exports Questions37.       The immunity from enemy export control temporarily accorded to italian shipping was last v/eek withdrawn.     Bases were instructed toexamine manifests and to report details regarding uncertificated items of which they were suspicious.     Cargo so reported was to be detained.38.       The Committee considered the question of outward bound con-si gnments of goods of Dutch and Belgian origin, both cargo and parcelsmail.     They thought that the best course to pursue would be to placesuch goods in Prize with a view to their release upon payment (if not already made) being made to the proper authority.     The Representativeof the Belgian Government concurred in this view, but the view of the netherland Government is not yet known.39.       The question of enemy export control of goods leaving Finlandthrough Petsamo was considered.     The Committee directed that export-ers should obtain certificates of origin and interest from K.M.Consul at Helsinki and that; the Finnish Government be informed thattheir outward bound ships should call at Kirkwall for control.Should the Finnish Government object to the latter procedure, theCommittee thought the matter could then be considered further.U0. The/
lj.0.       The Committee referred to the Exemption Committee a request from the Argentine Governriient that all their outstanding applicatifor exemption should he gr&amp;nced.      In view of the facts that no nr.ment had been made in any of the applications from private firms&quot; That it was not known whether any payment had been made in the casof the Government applications and no offer of any correspondingconcession had been made by the Argentine Government, the Gommittedecided to adopt its normal procedure of refusing the applicationsfor which payment had not been made and asking for further inform-ation in cases in which this point was not clear.     The Committeenot at this stage prepared to accept the view that money was now olittle value to the enemy.     If, however, higher authority decidedthat some concession must be made to the Argentine Government theCommittee suggested that only certain applications which it specifshould be granted.hi. The Committee referred to the Exemptions Committee an appliation from the Brazilian Government to import arms for the Braziliarmy. The Committee in refusing the application were governed bysimilar considerations to those in the Argentine case. Informatiwas also before the Committee that high officers in the Brazilianarmy had strong pro-Nazi sympathies.
