NINETEENTH FORTNIGHTLY REPORT by THE SECRETARY for mines covering the Period 1st to 15th JUNE, 1940.COAL POSITION.Production and Employment.The rise in production to 4*956,500 tons for the week ended the 1st June, the highest for any week since February, 1938, hasnot been maintained, and a decline of nearly 100,000 tons is recorded for the week ended 8th June.      The time worked at the pitswas unchanged and the numbers employed were slightly higher;    andthere is no very good reason for the falling off in production,apart from about 30,000 tons lost in the Midland (Amalgamated)district during repairs of machinery, and a small loss in Lanarkand Fife owing to the holding of Gala Days.      The falling off mustin the main be attributed to the minor and unavoidable variations in working conditions from time to time.     These variations ariseout of the nature of coal mining, such as the holding up of production for development work, the repair of machinery etc., all of which tendto impair the validity of purely week-to-week comparisons of output.For the industry as a whole, production during the week ended8th June was, in spite of the decline on the previous week, some350,000 tons above the corresponding output a year ago.Estimated Quantity of Saleable Coal Raised.25th may 1st june 8th June(prov.)Warre-Earners-25th may 1st june 8th June(prov.)Week ended1940Tons4,878,6004,956,5004,857,200762,800764,200765,800-Corresponding Week1939Tons4,595,9003,160,100 x4,506,600775,100774,200773,900Number employed in the week ended9th September, 1939, was 748,600Time Worked (Days).25th may 1st june 8th June(prov.)5.735.745. 755.143.7^ x5. 09Whitsun holidays.
- 2 -Production Council.Following the establishment of Production Committees in allthe principal mining districts,  the Secretary for Mines has appointedsix Coal Production Adivsers  (for Scotland, Wales,  the North Eastern,North Western, West Midland and Yorkshire and east Midland Districts&apos;respectively) .      These Advisers v/ho have also been appointed membersof &quot;the Coal Production Council will form a link between the localCommittees and the Mines Department  (including the Council) andtheir main duty will be to stimulate and facilitate the work of theCommittees in maintaining and increasing the production of coal.In some oases they are acting as Chairmen of the Committees.Pi s tr1bu t ion.The distribution situation has been materially affected bydevelopments in France;    the scaling down of French requirements on june from 2,700,000 tons to l,700,000x,  following that country&apos;sloss of ports and industries, has released a substantial tonnage forinland consumption and export to neutral destinations,  greatlyeasing the situation.      The current requirements of the rapidly expanding high-priority Industries are being fully met,  and someadditions are being made to stock.      In the few cases where localsupplies are still short the Coal Supplies Officers continue to use their powers to divert coal to these i^H^tries.The decline of the export trade halPfiecessitated some changesin the normal course of trade.      In Lancashire the main impedimentto the purchase by industrial and public utility undertakings of coal from Northumberland and Durham has been removed by a scheme  (recently approved by the Secretary for Mines ) for spreading among the consumerconcerned the extra cost of such coal above that of the local supplieThe replenishment of the coal reserves of the public utilitiesIs constantly under review.      Particular attention Is being paid tothe gas \xnder takings, of which there were 84 with stocks of two weeks and under for the week ended Sth June,  as compared with 92 inthe previous week.      The electricity works are in a more favourable position,  there being only 4 works in this category.      Progress indealing with these cases has been hindered recently by other heavy demands on the railways.      Coal Supplies Officers and DivisionalCoal Officers have now been instructed to give prior attention tothe gas undertakings in a weak position and to raise their stocks to at least six weeks&apos; supply within the next fortnight,  if possible,even if this means a diversion of supplies from undertakings whichhave already reached the 8 weeks&apos; level.The demand for house coal over the country as a whole is greater than normal for this time of year,  and is no do-rabies due tothe stocking of coal by consumers.      There is some Improvement inmerchants&apos; stocks but they are still very much less than a year ago,and this matter is under consideration.As soon as a surplus becomes available  (after meeting thedemands either for current consumption or for stocking) it Isproposed to proceed with the building up of Government stocks of house coal.     A number of sites are now ready for use, butGovernment purchases of coal for this purpose have, for the timebeing, to be confined  to the less popular Northumberland coal.x Since the period under review, all shipments to France have ceased.This will leave a surplus of coal for export which cannot be readilyabsorbed in home markets.
jmentingme for normal supplies,  theAs part of its policy of supplDepartment is maintaining its progrtrainloads to London and the South.12th June 187 trains were consignedof 14 house and 40 Industrial coal trains for Northumberland, 90industrial trains from Durham and 45 industrial trains from theMidlands.During the week endedto these divisions, consistingExports.The curtailment of the French programme  (followed by the suspension of shipments subsequent to the period under review) has left a surplus of coal for export.     If the Mediterranean should be entirely closed to coal shipments even in neutral bottoms apparentlythe only markets available for this coal will be South America,Eire and Portugal  (and possibly Spain) and the bunker depots abroadapart from the possibility of expanding the anthracite trace with canada and the U.S.A. by special measures.1 Cargo Shipments.(tons)25th May1940Alldestina-tions518,5001st June     1567,5008th June(prov,)ikers for foreign-going vessels,25th May605,2001st june 8th June(prov,)1132,600144,800129,700France &amp;FrenchEmpire348,300(France304,500)315,000(France267,200)386,100(France312,500)tal Quantity of Coal      i&apos; i-pped Abroad (including&quot;-e coal equivalent ofwke and manufactured fuel)25th May 708,5001st June 729,0008th June      760,700x French Empire figure:fL, 192, 700965,300947,600ijtot available for 1939. 11939Alldestina-tionsQ35,500730,400735,100169,700138,900142,300France3149,90096,100126,3008521.6.40
