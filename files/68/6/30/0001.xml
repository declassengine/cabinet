This is the first time since the last war that a monthlyutput of over 1,000 aircraft has been achieved.    It is also worthyf note that, in the deliveries of fighter aircraft are included 5urricanes from Canada.    These are the first Dominion-made Serviceircraft to be received. -5.     A further increase in output could have been achieved butor the shortage of steel and light alloys.    The supply of plywoods also becoming difficult.    The British Supply Board in america as been asked to investigate the possibility of obtaining increasedupplies of plywood from Canada.6.     Orders for 1,550 aircraft were released during April,rders placed since the beginning of the war in this country nowotal 21,650, in Canada 310, and in U.S.A. 1,320, at an estimatedost of  489 million.   Further large orders are in course of beinglaced by the Allied Governments in the United States..REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL (NO ..9) BY THE AIR ministry on SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION..roduction Generally.The rate of expansion of production is at present limitedy supplies of fabricated light alloy and of steel.   Production ofight alloys is in turn limited by the fabricating plant available,ew plant is on order but there is a deficiency of suitable heavychining capacity.    If the fabricating plant (extrusion presses andhe rolling mills) is delayed, it will be necessary to attempt toover the increased deficiency which such delay will cause by furtherurchases of light alloys from U.S.A.    Capacity for the fabricationf light alloys in U.S.A. is, however, not extensive.2.     Production at a number of aircraft factories is beingelayed, and men are standing idle, owing to shortage of steel bars,ubes, sheet and stampings.    The position has been aggravated by thetoppage of supplies from Sweden, particularly as regards steel tubesnd hall bearings.ir craft,.3.     The actual and planned outputs of aircraft during Aprilnd since the 1st January, 1940, are given In the following table.. .he figures shown in brackets are &quot;outputs from Canada and U.S..A..

The following are the more important measures approvedduring April to increase productive capacity for engine accessories:(i) Sleeves for Bristol engines.- To meet the peak output ofBristol engines, approximately 5,000 sleeves a week arerequired; present capacity is only oapablo of producing4,000 sleeves a week. It has therefore been decided toprovide new buildings and plant at Sheffield for Pirth-Vickers at ar. estimated cost of  175,000, in order toincrease production by 2,000 sleeves a week a(ii)     Hob son carburet tors     The peak demand for Hob son typecarburettors is 3,000 a month.    Present capacity is onlycapable of producing 2,000 Hob son carburettors a month..The Triumph factory at Coventry has therefore been acquired and expenditure of  108,000 authorised for the adaptation of the factory., the provision of machine tools,test equipment; etc,  in order to give an output of1,000 Hobson carburettors a month0(iii)     Magnetoso    1,330 magnetos by January, 1941, and 1,630 by september.,, 1941, are needed for Mercury VIII and XVengines, and 400 electric starters a month for Merlin X1---1 Jan0       j       Feb., i	March	April296         i        201 4-86                 427 226                  235 19                    21 395         !        254 1	280 507 205 17 270	347 641 309 14 369,422     &quot;   1   1,239	1,279	1,680

engines0    Existing capacity at the Rotax works atWillesden amounts to 700 magnetos and 160 starters amonths    To meet the deficiency a new factory has been authorised at Merthyr Tydfil at an estimated cost of 221,000 for the production of Rotax magnetos and electric starters for Mercury and Merlin engines. juiument (General Remarks&quot;).11.     Broadly speaking, production is matching the aircraftrogramme, together with 15 per cent for maintenance, except forertain important items which were incompletely developed at theutbreak of war, for example automatic pilots, distant readingompasses and gun sights.    Production of these is, however, increasingnthly as experience    is gained by the operatives.12.     Instrumentso   Production of the majority of instruments isubstantially up to programme.    There was some set-back in outputuring the early part of the year due to the very high rate ofickness in factories, but the output figures are now returning toormal.    Other factors which have caused delay are the time taken toeducate new firms, material supply difficulties and lateness ininalising technical design.13.     While shortage of material has been a serious factor in the production of certain instruments, machine tool supply is the st urgent problem where expansion schemes are in progress,    Asoon as these schemes reach completion, labour shortage will be therincipal limiting factor, particularly as night shifts are contem-lated to an increasing extent.14.     The principal extensions authorised during April are for he manufacture of turning indicators, by Reid &amp; Sigrist and Ferranti,t a total estimated capital cost of  40,000, and for aircraft com-asses by a number of firms at an estimated capital cost of  70,000.15.     Radio equipment,,    Radio apparatus for the Royal Air Forcefalls into two categories:(i)     General communications.    Current needs are being met without major difficulty and new sets are being broughtinto production as the designs are completed.    The newsets are:A. V.H0F.  for fighter aircraft;B. cp. set for bomber and general reconnaissance aircraft; andC. Blind approach sets.Some delays are being experienced, principally in regardto component materials for B, and designs and drawingsfor C,    Current types of equipment are, however, being produced in sufficient quantity for the aircraft programme.(ii)     R.D.F,  equipment.    The main C.H.  stations are being produced and installed as required;    some- delay has been caused by lack of fabricated insulators but this diffi-culty has now been overcome.    The remaining R.D.F.  ground equipment is urgently needed and the rate of productionagreed with the Air Staff is, in general, being met.There were delays in the provision of vehicles and cabinsfor the mobile equipment, certain transmitting valvesare net yet being delivered in sufficient quantitiesfully to meet our needs, and design modifications have caused an initial delay of three months.

Experimental work with 1-g- metre detection valveshas introduced modifications into the series being manu-factured, but the design has now been stabilised and pro-duction will proceed to completion at the rate agreed with a delay of two months..Air-borne equipment has been seriously delayed bythe necessity for simultaneous research and developmentduring manufacture,    Of the three main classes of equip-merit, that for assisting night interception is stillunsatisfactory in operation, and with the agreement ofthe Air Staff manufacture has been suspended..    It has nowbeen decided to complete 100 equipments to the initialdesign.Identification equipment is being delivered at a ratesufficient to fit aircraft in a defined order   of prioritybut, again, additions to operational equipments maynecessitate a suspension of the complete programme..The equipment for ship detection from the air has beenmade in small quantities and the experience obtained withthis initial equipment has resulted in the developmentof the final type.   Bulk manufacture will commence in about three months&apos; time.16.     Equipment other than armament, instruments and radio..    Theumber of small items of equipment necessary to meet the Air Ministryrogramme is very large.    These &quot;items being, in the main, of minorharacter, are particularly susceptible to changes in design and ofperational requirements;   This upsets production.    There is rarelyny difficulty in meeting demands for equipment that has been properlyeveloped provided no changes are made during the course of manufacture.,f the 212 items on the list of shortages, only 43 will remain to beleared on 1st June.    Of these 43, only 9 are air-borne stores whichight affect operational efficiency or maintenance.Supplies of material present constant difficulty.    Shortagef machine tools is not yet a serious factor, but it is anticipatedhat it will be in the future.    No great difficulty is being exper-experienced in obtaining labour for day shifts, but in some localities its difficult to obtain sufficient labour to man the night shifts..rearmament.17.     Production of e303&apos;f Browning guns during the next six monthsccording to programme is likely to cause difficulty.    Increased pro-uction is dependent on supplies of machine tools and materials, andeliveries of these are behind schedule.    The general positionegarding supplies of steel and machine tools is being discussed with the Ministry of Supply,18,      The following are the principal extensions authorisedduring April:-(a)      56,800 gun sights are needed by the end of 1941.Deliveries from existing sources of supply will reach a total of 30,400 leaving a deficit of 26,400.    extensions to the works and plant of Wray Ltd. have been authorisedat an estimated cost of  10,000,   These extensions will produce 4,000 gun sights by the end of 1941 and a deficit of 22,400 remains to be met.

(b) 10,750 sets of components a month are needed for the 500 lb.S.A.P.. bomb.   Existing productive capacity will provide1,050 sets of components a month, and proposals putforward by Jarrow Metal Industries for providing 7,500sets a month at an estimated capital cost of  56,000 havebeen approved.    A deficit of 2,200 remains to be met.(c) To meet requirements for 4.5&quot; reconnaissance flares produc-tion must be increased from 9,600 to 50,480 flares a month.42 additional presses, each capable of-turning out 1,200flare candles a month, have been authorised for distribu-tion amongst a number of firms at an estimated cost of 52,400.abour, .19.     Owing to the shortage of material, labour does not at theVesent time present a serious problem.    Indeed, many factories havedie hands.    But as soon as the material situation eases it is anti-ipated that the labour position, particularly at the newer factories,ill become acute.    A detailed survey is therefore being made of theabour position at each of the principal factories with specialegard to the arrangements made, or proposed, by the firms for train-fng labour.. This survey has so far shown the need for the institution1 long-term training courses (three to six months) at the new air-ame factories at Blackpool, Stoke, Watford and Yeadon as soon asjhese factories are sufficiently far advanced, and for conversionburses at the new aero-engine factories at Accrington and Liverpool.jaterials.-20.     Fabricated light alloys.   A review of the light alloyxtrusion, tube and wire industry has shown that, provided the newfxtrusion presses now on order are delivered according to plan (see para.- 1.- above),. production of light alloy extrusions during thecurrent year will fall short of requirements by 2,000 tons.    If the delivery of the new presses is delayed by three months, the&quot; deficiencyduring 1940 will amount to four months1 supply at the current ratef production.The deficiency is being met by purchases from the UnitedStates.    Orders have been placed for 1,100 tons of extrusions and 1,000&quot;ens of rolled forging stock in the United States and further orders are being considered.    The capacity of the American light alloy indus-try is, however, limited, and is likely to be largely absorbed in thefuture by orders from American aircraft firms.    Approximately 172 tonsof extrusions were shipped from America during April.21.     Magnesium.    It was stated in the last report that it wouldHe necessary to buy 1,000 tons of magnesium from the United States,luring April, the British Supply Board in America were authorised toaccept offers for 550 tons of magnesium for delivery during 1940.other enquiries are being made,22.     Controller of Light Alloy.    In order to ensure adequate control of the manufacture, disposal and distribution of light alloyin the national interests, a Controller with statutory powers isabout to be appointed.    It is probable that his functions, will ultimately be extended to include control of Magnesium, for the pro-action of which it has been agreed that the Air Ministry is respon-Sible.   -

2.3.     Steel0    As stated in paragraph 1, the supply of steel is using grave concern.    Aircraft and engine firms have men standingale due to shortage of material, and unless the position improves,t will he impossible to keep to the present programme..The position has been discussed with the Ministry of Supplyho have obtained approval to buy from the United States of America&apos; 000 tons of steel billets towards meeting Air Ministry needs.On the engine side, an order has been placed in the Unitedtates for 2,000 sets of crankshaft forgings and 1,000 engine sets of lower parts for Mercury engines.    These are needed by the Shadowngine factories which have been thrown out of balance owing to thehortage of steel 0Steel rolling mills have been unable to effect delivery ofteel for structural purposes according to schedule for new factories,ut by adjusting the various orders no delays of serious consequenceave occurred.    Unless, however, the position improves it is antici-ated that, at a later date, an order of priority will have to bentroduced for the construction of new factories.    Everything possibles being done to obviate the use of building materials by adaptingxisting factories.rogress of new factories and extensions.24.     The use of more bricks, concrete slabs and breeze blocksnd other materials in place of timber (soft woods) has eased theupply position.UMMARY.25.Aircraft.ft(a) Supplies of steel and light alloy are at presentthe limiting factors in aircraft production (Para-graphs 1 and 2).(b) 1,130 aircraft (including 49 from Canada and U.S.A.)were delivered during April.
