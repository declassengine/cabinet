MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC WARFARE

Weekly Report of Action taken for the period 5th May to 19th May, 1940.

1. War Trade Negotiations and Relations with Neutral States.

SWEDEN.  On the 7th May, H.M. Minister at Stockholm was authorised by the Foreign office to inform the Swedish Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government attached the greatest value to the maintenance of their War trade Agreement with Sweden and were anxious in present circumstances to help her to develop new channels of trade.  They were not in principle opposed to an increase of her trade with the Soviet Union, though they would require further details of what was contemplated before committing themselves further.

2. Further consideration has been given to other possible outlets for Swedish trade. Owing to our naval operations in the Skaggerak we have had to reject the Swedish request for our co-operation in arranging trial trips to and from Gothenberg. But we are doing what we can to promote trade via Petsamo and Kirkenes, and should probably be able to supply lorries and petrol for use in the further transit. We have asked the Swedes for a priority list of what goods they would wish to import from the United Kingdom by this route.

3. We have agreed to certain Swedish exports being sent across Germany by rail, subject to a number of conditions. The Swedish Minister has raised the question of using the Kiel Canal for trade between Sweden and the United States and possibly South America also. He has promised a written communication on the subject and the request will then be considered.

4. Instructions were addressed to H.M. Minister at Stockholm on the 9th May regarding Swedish mineral and iron and steel products. It was suggested that these should be considered in three categories:-

(a) those which are important to our requirements and which it is hoped to ship via Petsamo and Kirkenes. These are quantitatively unimportant.

(b) key commodities which should if possible be witheld from Germany. These consist of ores and ferro-alloys of chrome; molybdenum and tungsten. These are all commodities with which the Ferrolegeringar Company is especially concerned, and the Director of the Company, who has been in London, would apparently be willing to sell the Company&apos;s whole production of ferro-chrome or alternatively its stocks of chrome ore to His Majesty&apos;s Government. H.M. Minister has been instructed to sound the Swedish Government as to whether they would permit such sale.

(c) various iron and steel products, also of economic warfare value, which we are entitled to import under the War Trade Agreement. Numerous contracts have already been signed, and it is now a question of seeing that the contracts are maintained, either by the individual firms or by His Majesty&apos;s Government. H.M. Minister has emphasised the importance of their maintenance as a means of resisting pressure, both by the German Government and by the Swedish exporters, to sell the goods to Germany.

5. Treasury authority has now been received to spend up to Â£100,000 for the purchase of chrome from the Ferrolegeringar Company.

6. The Treasury have also sanctioned the expenditure necessary to maintain in force the contracts for special steels, special pig iron, ferro-alloys and machine tools. It is a condition of the Treasury offer,  that the contracts should be varied to provide for delivery ? a northern port (i.e. Petsamo or Kirkenes), and it is hoped to obtain delivery of some of those products which are needed here, by this route.

7.The commencement of the Swedish-German economic discussions in Berlin was postponed by the Germans and they are now expected to start on the 27th May.

8. A Swedish official Delegation left Stockholm for Moscow on the 15th May to discuss possibilities of increasing Swedish-Russian trade: and an agreement
(r - 2 -agreement is reported to have been reached providing for the sale by theU.S.S.R, of i4.00.Uuu tons of petroleum and certain quantities of fats andfodder in exchange for iron and steel goods.9.     agreement has been reached in principle regarding the disposal of swedish cargoes detained in the United Kingdom as a result of the invasion of Scandinavia.FINLAND.lUi     Further ships have sailed to Petsamo from the. United Kingdom and gibraltar.     The Finnish 3.s. Greta has re turned to the United kingdom from Petsamo with a cargo of iron ore which she loaded at Kirkenes;another Finnish ship is now loading at that port on her return from1- o bsamc.NuRV*aY.11.     Discussions have taken place with the Norwegian authorities regard-ing the disposal of cargoes detained in British poi*ts.     The general principle agreed is that, unless ownership is still vested in the con-signor, such goods will be purchased by His Majesty&apos;s Government if suit-able to their requirements;    if unsuitable they will be disposed of inthe most advantageous market consistent with the economic employment ofthe ship.     It has been agreed that all such cargoes may be sold in theUnited Kingdom without import licence.bpaim.12.     un May Lq.th, K.M. Representative in Madrid reported a protest ingeneral terms by the Spanish Government against the operation of our contraband control in regard to Spanish ships.     This is still underconsideration, but in the meantime, in deference to a remonstrance from.M.. Representative, action has been suspended on instructions issued onMay 17th, which defined in a^ str iagent sense the control&quot;to&apos;be exercised over ships trading between Spain and her overseas possessions.PORTUGAL.13.     ivir. Eccles returned from Lisbon on May 17th to report progress inhis exploration of the local conditions, with a view to the possibleresumption of negotiations for a Vnar Trade Agreement..     His general con-elusions were that, while it would be impossible to get satisfaction onany lines previously contemplated as regards control of air services, itshould be possible to conclude an otherwise satisfactory Avar Trade Agree-ment;   but that the whole problem of Spain and Portugal should in presentcircumstances be dealt with on a much broader basis for mainly political reasons.     He saw reason to hope that Dr. salazar would be prepared toUoe his influence with.General Franco in a sense favourable to the Allies,if means could be found to relieve the immediate necessities of Spain,especially in the matter of wheat supplies, and of the purchase of live-stocic and other produce from the Portuguese colonies in Africa with thefinancial assistance of His Majesty&apos;s Government.     This programme isengaging the urgent attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government, with a view tothe issue of early instructions to H.M. iSrabassy at Lisbon, to which placeMr. uScdes returned by air on May 21st. &apos;I4..     The response of the Portuguese Government to our latest proposalsfor a coal-pitwood agreement, being &quot;unsatisfactory as regards the suppliesof pitwood to be guaranteed by the Portuguese, it was decided on May 16thnot to attempt a formal agreement..      The strong representations of ivir.iiccles produced a modification of this decision and he took back to ui&amp;botion May 21st new proposals -under which Portugal would be assured of notless than qtuOOO; tons of coal per month, and we should accept the view the Portuguese that they cannot guarantee more than 12,-UOO tons of pitwdod(as distinct! f rom pitprops and other timber) subject to a. hope that thefigures on bjoth sides may in practice be increased.     The Portuguese have in fact been treated as liberally as circumstances permit in the matterof coal, which is naturally their principal preoccupation and the 40,000tons to be definitely guaranteed is only to be regarded as a minimum.ITALY/
ITALY.15.     The outstanding features of the last fortnight were the progressivedeterioration of the political situation in Italy and a substantialiVchange of.policy in our contraband control vis-a-vis Italy,     Variousapproaches by Marc lies e Pat rizi led to a suggestion from him that with the entry into the war of the Low Countries, control of all really vital rawmaterial could be effectively, imposed at the source of supply instead ofat the entrance to the Mediterranean.     In this context Marchese Patrizialso stated that, the Italian Authorities had decided to co-operate inmaKing the Navicert system work  in traffic from the Americas,     Thesecircumstances led to the&quot;decision by His. Majesty&apos;s Government to send the master of the Polls accompanied by a representative of the Ministry ofEconomic warfare to Rome, to maice contact v/ith the Italian Authorities.,;with the. object of meeting their complaints about our control in theMediterranean if the&quot; Italian Government should signify their desire todiscuss the matter.    .An intimation was duly received from Rome to theeffect that the. Duce was willing and. in..consequence&apos; Sir V/ilfred Greeneand Mr, .J&quot;&apos;.W. Ni.oh.nicholls left on truth May for Rome...     Sir W. Greene was authorised to announce, the &apos;.suspension of contraband control in the Medit-mediterranean in view of the, co-operative attitude displayed by the Italianson the subject of navicerts.. &apos; Having.regard to this policy, it was also decided not to subject the inward-bound Italian liner &quot;Rex&quot; and the out-ward: bound liner &quot;Conti di savoia&quot; to control on their passage throughthe Straits of Gibraltar.     ......16, -   The Norwegian tankers under charter to Italian &quot;oil importers havebeen held at Allied ports, in the Mediterranean and are being allowed toproceed for discharge two by two after which it is understood they areto be requisitioned for Allied use.ROUMANIa. * ; &quot; .;17.     A rationing agreement was. initialled,with the Roumanian delegation on May 11th.     The British, and Roumanian&quot;&quot;Delegations had for some&apos; timesettled the terms pf this agreement, but It. has not yet been possible toreceive the final concurrence of the French Government, who agreed, how-ever,&quot; that the documents should be. initialled.     The.French Governmontdesire to-consider further, the-manner,in which the&apos;wenger contraoss forthe .purchase of&apos; oil from Roumania are&apos;to-..fit in with the rationingagreement. They have now approached the Roumanian Delegation on thispoint, and discussions are still in progress.18.    In addition to fixing quotas for&apos;the-imports of all important commodities - into Roumania,  the letters attached to the agreement containassurances that the Roumanian Government will maintain in force theexisting prohibition of exports to. all countries of jute sacks, wool and7 wool products, and hides,  and that the Roumanian Government will not.   import any motor vehicles without. tyres.    The- first full quarter of the;&apos;. agreement&apos;s operation will begin on June 1st, and it is proposed that&apos; two-thirds of the.quotas agreed for the first quarter will be allowed-into Roumania during the months of April and May.YUGOSLAVIA.  . ;&apos;&quot; &apos;   .19. The quotas, for Castor seed, Toluol, and Sodium Nitrate under the rationing.agreement with^Yugoslavia have been declared closed for thecurrent -quarter..,&apos;.        - &quot; ,V. S.A&quot;.  AND &quot;S&quot;. AMERICA.  .,20.    In view.-&quot;of. indications that the United States Government would beprepared to consider any proposals which.&apos;we might advance for assistancein ..the sphere of economic v/arf are, - Lord Lothian has been instructedto enquire, whether - the United States Government will be prepared(1)    To&apos; institute a. system of export licences on lines similar tothose now in force in the British and French Empires.Failing their ability to do this, whether the United StatesGovernment will prohibit any shipment to any European destinationwithout a navicert.
(2) To block all German balances in the U.S.A.(3) To prevent the sale of bearer securities shipped frcrrEurope except under licence.21.     An interim reply has been received by Lord Lothian c-v-al-lnj;that Mr. Hull has agreed to give these proposals immediate ny.-.-pathetic consideration.22.     Arrangements are now being made to extend the naric/.-:^- ;system to all Central and South American countries in which, it. :not at present operating, with the exception 01&apos; Mexico0JAPAN.   &quot;.&apos; &apos; &apos;- &apos;     - : - , : -23.     The Japanese Ambassador called at the Ministry of economic warfare on the 10th May in pursuance of a suggestion ma At?&quot; - f-o himby the Foreign Office that the British and Japanese governments might reach an Understanding regarding certain economic matters dealt with by the Ministry1 of Economic Warfare..&quot;    it&quot;v/as suggested to the Ambassador that the general. basis- ofthe proposed,&quot;.under-standing might&apos;be as&apos;follows:- ;.,   . &apos;    &quot;&quot;(a) The Japanese Government. would take measures to prevent cer-tain commodities, to be specified by His&apos; Majesty&apos;&apos;&amp;&apos; .

Japanese ---domestic&apos; requirements. &apos;-     &apos; .      ,2k.    The Japanese Ambassador-stated that,his Governrjient realised the war requirements kof His Majesty&apos;s Government and woujld be willing to see what they could do to meet them,; but th;ey&apos;:V/cu.ldhave their own desiderata to put forward.     The Ambassador appear-ed&quot; to have in mind some wider discussions covering trade bet-weenJapan and the British&apos;Empire..    He undertook that. he. would form-ulate these Japanese requirements and communicate&quot;them as-soonas possible. .&quot;25.    The Japanese Embassy subsequently, on.the. lhth May, commun-ipated a memorandum suggesting that discussions might be5 openedregarding (a) the supply of Japanese commodities to Great&apos;Britainand the British Empire and (b) the supply of raw materials fromthe British Empire to Japan.      On the first point the JapaneseEmbassy communicated a list of the commodities which Japan was able to supply to Great Britain and the British -Empire, and.asked to be&apos; informed what quantities.- of these, commodities GreatBritain and the British Empire were /ready to purchase.. -.? On thesecond point, the Japanese Embassy communicated a - list ::of - toe- rawmaterials and goods required by Japan, and stated that the main object of the Japanese Government was-, to obtain a maximum quan-tity of raw materials from the British  dominions and -colonies,NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES. &apos; - . : . -.. ; &quot;26.     Owing to the German.invasion of Holland &quot;it should prove   ^possible to arrange for restrictions, on exports:from.the Nether-lands East Indies, the most important.:pf which are&quot;rubber and tin.

I--&quot;    Contraband and Enemy Exports Control.STATISTICS.      A.  Contraband Control.28,     During the fortnight ending 18th May 110 new ships were dealt with, less than half of the number which used to come for-ward in the like xoeriod before the invasion of Scandinavia.      In82 cases advance copies of manifests of cargoes were received and considered before the ship&apos;s arrival at Contraband control bases, and in hi such cases the ships concerned.were released bythe Committee subject to the formal checking of the originalmanifests on their arrival at the Control Bases.29.     About 16,164 tons of goods were directed to be seized.      Inthe 7 weeks ending 18th May   16,255 tons of goods, mainly oil seeds,were released from seizure by the Contraband Committee.30.      39 ships were allowed to carry forward cargo under Hold-Backguarantees.31.      The number - of ships at United&apos;Kingdom control bases at theend cf last week&apos;was 49 of which 14 were at Kirkwall.     Rams gatebase has been completely cleared, and the vessels there senteither to Weymouth or to London.      In the week ending 18th May noships were cleared from United Kingdom bases for neutral destln-ations.32.      Navicert applications for the week ending 11th May totalled1,788, and for the following week,  861/     The stream of new applic-ations is now, as a result of the disappearance of the Scandinavianand Low Countries-,.&apos;as consignee countries, considerably lower thanformerly. .. . The weekly average for the first quarter was 2,500.Applications &quot;for Switzerland and Italy the principal remainingconsignee countries were well maintained in the week ending 11thMay but fell off considerably in the following v/eek.     During thefortnight 23 fully navicerted ships were released bringing thetotal to date up to 253,S. Enemy Exports Control.33,      The Enemy Exports Committee met five times this week.      Itreviewed 7 ships, of which 4 were released, 1 was detained forpartial/called at the Ministry of Economic Warfare on the 10th May and discussed the position.      Subsequently,  the Netherlands author-ities telegraphed, to the Governor-General at Batavia emphasising the urgent necessity of preventing the produce of the netherlands east Indies from reaching Germany via Japan and Vladivostok.Their telegram - also recommended,  in accordance with a suggestionput forward by the Ministry of Economic Warfare, that a system of export licences to all destinations -should be established, with atotal prohibition of all exports for a few days, pending the Intro-duction of this export licensing system.27.      It soon became clear however that in view of the greatimportance of giving the Japanese Government no excuse for attack-ing the Netherlands East Indies,  it would be dangerous to stop anyexports to Japan,      It is now known that the Japanese Government &apos;have made formal demands of the Netherlands authorities for thesupplies which.they wish to receive from the Netherlands east indies.      The whole question is being urgently considered in con- .sidered in connexion with the proposed negotiations with theJapanese Government.
partial unloading and search, I was referred to the Minister on the question of the policy to be adopted towards Italy and I was referred to be dealt with by the Department in consultation with the Belgian Government. No Items were directed to be placed in Prize.

34. The Committee considered 19 specific applications for exemption, granting 5 and refusing 14, in addition to applications treated summarily, of which 11 were granted and 8 refused.

General Contraband Questions.

35. With the invasion of the Low Countries by Germany, contraband control in the sense of the examination and scrutiny of cargoes consigned in the first instance to neutral countries, has practically come to an end so far as Northern Europe is concerned. Virtually all the ports in Northern Europe are either in enemy possession or in danger of enemy occupation, or accessible only through waters under enemy control, or else they are now Allied ports. The few remaining ports through which goods might reach neutrals by relatively safe routes are all well within the Arctic circle.

36. Cargoes are not at present going forward to Dutch and Belgian ports. When ships with such cargoes come into English ports they are detained,  and the disposal of the cargo is settled in consultation with the Belgian Embassy or the Dutch Legation.

37. All Outstanding applications for navicerts for Belgium and Holland have been granted. It is hoped that this will encourage the shipment of goods to these destinations. When the ships arrive in the Channel, arrangements will be made, in consultation with Dutch and Belgian authorities, for disposing of the cargoes.

38. M. Bastin, of the Belgian Embassy, has joined the Contraband Committee as Belgian representative. The Dutch Legation have been invited to appoint a Dutch representative on the Committee but have not yet done so. The Norwegian Legation have agreed to send a representative whenever any matters affecting Norway are being discussed by the Committee.

39. The Estonians wish to ascertain how we would regard shipments to Estonia via the Russian Arctic port of Murmansk. They have not yet approached the U.S.S.R.  on the matter.

40. The Hungarian Minister has been informed that in the present exceptional circumstances we should not raise any objection to the sending of Hungarian manufactured goods through Germany to Sweden, the Baltic States and Finland. Certain precautions are, however, to be taken to ensure their safe transit through Germany.

41. It has been decided that all goods detained for enquiries at Genoa or Triests under &apos;hold-back&apos; undertakings in transit for Switzerland should be released by the authority of H.M. Embassy in Reme as soon as H.M. Consul-General at Berne has satisfied himself that they are destined for a suitable region in Switzerland.

42. Of the consignments for Switzerland which were previously directed to be seized and which are now lying under hold-back in Italian ports, some are to be reshipped without delay to Allied ports; the remainder are to be treated in the same way as the detained consignments mentioned in the previous paragraph.

43. We have requested H.M. Embassy at Rome to arrange the transfer of raw materials for Yugoslavia, at present under hold-back at Italian ports, to Yugoslavia, where they will continue to be withheld/
it?, It has been decided to release all. goods destined: forand under &quot;hold-back.&quot;&apos; in Italian ports, which had arrived. 1:ports up to midnight on the 19th May.-talyi+6.     As a result of the political situation and special inform-ation relating to - &quot;this particular: ship^ - the Italian liner KEXwas allowed to pass through the Straits of Gibraltar on her.&quot; oast-&apos;ward voyage without interception and detention for contraband control.hi.     In pursuance of the same policy,, all Italian ships hinvestigation of suspect cargo have been released and ins&apos;-:sent to Gibraltar based on intelligence of forthcoming shi;have been cancelled.Agreement,with firms1+8.

The cargo so tele-graphed will be held back at the port of discharge andif necessary, shipped back for seizure.The company agrees to offer facilities at all peris forour Consuls to inspect the loading and unloading of cargo.49. Exporters Agreements have been concluded with Borax, and chemicals Ltd,, and Borax Consolidated Ltd..  two British com-panies which control the larger part of American Bora:Europe.to50.     An Agreement on the lines of the Porestal Agreement hasbeen signed with Messrs. A.

The U7S&apos;.A.  have been pressing the Ministry to authoriseshipment of all German goods in Dutch and Belgian port?, for united States importers whether or not exemption has previously been refused, in view of the possibility of the goods being acquired by Germany.52j The Enemy Exports Committee considered the generalarising as a result of the invasion of Belgium and uclipdirected, that all applications for exemption in respect in Belgian ports should be referred to the Belgian roverand that instructions should be sent to Consuls likely tconcerned that certificates of origin must not bo grarAe.position..d.
