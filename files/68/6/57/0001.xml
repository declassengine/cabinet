This isthe largest monthly amount so far recorded during the war.The storage for civil purposes in the U.K.  at present isfor practical purposes full.      Imports for these purposesduring July may therefore be on a lower level, but steps havebeen taken to hold 10 loaded tankers at ports, in the U.K. andother tankers not immediately required will be held abroad atHalifax and Bermuda to provide a mobile reserve.

The consumption figure for Air ministry aviation spirit in the U.K.  increased by 7,500 tons, but thefigures for overseas consumption are not yet available.Civil consumption during the four weeks ended 29th Juneincreased by 17,-800 tons as compared with the previous four weeks.     The consumption of Gas, Fuel and Diesel Oils increasedby 35,000 tons,  largely on account of additional bunkers in thiscountry.

The storage involved is 600,000 tons,bringing the total storage to be protected in this way to just-;over one million tons.     T/ork on these walls is commencing thisweek.&apos;&apos;Thinning; out&quot; of -octroi storage in certain coastal areasFThe plan for &quot;thinning out&quot; petrol supply points in the   Iarea   demarcated by the Military Authorities in the eastern andjSouthern portion of the country is being put into operation.Notices have already been served upon the various owners of thepremises concerned and the Petroleum Board have made arrangements to remove the petrol the the storages which are ..be closed.Air Raids.No substantial damage has so far been caused at oil installations.

On the second occasion oneoil tank was damaged by splinters and about 35 tons were lost.Owing to raids and warnings during a period of nine days therewas a decrease of about 40 per cent, in the production of motorf!spirit from the hydrogenation plant.     During a daylight raidon 1st July a tank at Saltend (Hull) containing about 2,600 tcof spirit was hit and set on fire.      Prompt measures were takenSto draw off the oil and to tackle the fire, which did not spreadsto any other tank.      In all only ahout 250 tons.of spirit was   iilost.G.
