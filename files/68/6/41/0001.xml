Eighteenth Weekly Report by the Secretary for Mines covering the period 1.6th - 31st May, 1940.COAL POSITION.dv.ction and Employment.Production has now more than recovered from the declinesuffered during the Whitsun holiday week.     The returns for theweek ended 25th May show that the seasonal decline in output is&quot;being resisted and that the pits are working practically full time.Absenteeism has been reduced to normal.      Further increases in production thus depend in the main on an increased output per shiftand/or an enlargement of the labour force in the mines.      TheCoal Production Council is exploring all the means of raising thelevel of output, and many of the District Production Committees haveunder consideration plans for the further reduction of absenteeism,shortening of holidays, etc.     There has, so far, been no importantchange in the numbers employed.Estimated Quantity of SaleableCoal Raised.11th May18th   &quot;25 thti(prov. )Wage-Earners.11th May18th   &quot;25th   &quot; (prov. )Week ended1940Tons4,727,4004,127,7004,875,700763,300762,500762,700Cor re s p conditions ngweek1959Tons4,705,9004,728,7004,595,900775,600775,400775,100Number employed in the week ended9th September, 1939, was 748,600.Time Worked (days).11th May18th   &quot;25th   11 (prov.)5. 595.275.73pplies.5* 255.215.27In view of the full-time working at the pits and the continuedseasonal decline in demand for cbal for heating and lighting, thesupply situation has eased in some respects.      It has not beenjjsible, however, to make available for stocking purposes all the1 so released from current consumption.      Further calls upon thejicnal output are being made to provide France with coal tobensate for the loss of a substantial proportion of her own[auction in the Pasde Calais and other northern coalfields, as a for substantial imports previously drawn from Belgium and[land.      In addition, the increasing needs of our own industriesje to be met, particularly those engaged full time, seven days afk, on Ministry of Supply contracts.In order to cover as far as possible the French provisionalluirements, a programme for the supply to France of someImillion tonsHhas been arranged for June.     This tonnage is likelyfbe increased.     As regards essential industries at home supplies[Since the end of the period under review, France has asked forthis figure to be made up to 2,700,000 tons, and arrangements are being made   on this basis.

In Lancashire,  the &apos;coal supplies Officer has reduced supplies to non-priority industries by25 per cent. , while the Coal Supplies Officer for the Warwickshiredistrict has made arrangements with the collieries whereby20 per cent,   of their output shall be put at his disposal for meeting the needs of essential industries.      The provisioning of essential industries is being closely watched by the Department, ?there is evidence to show that not only are current requirementsbeing met but increases in stocks are &quot;being obtained in some casesThe house coal position has to a large extent been simplifiedby the seasonal decline in demand, and the Department have authorised the relaxation or removal of all restrictions ondeliveries of domestic fuel wherever the state of supplies rjustifiesuch action.      The object is to release domestic fuel for stockingpurposes to the full extent of existing supplies.      Owing, however to the larger quantity now going to prance the amount available forstocking at home is not enough to meet the whole demand and therepresentatives of the Merchants&apos; organisations and the Co-operatiSocieties have undertaken to see that available supplies aredistributed equitably.      At the same time a broadcast appeal has &quot;bmade by the Secretary for Mines for the utmost economy in the usefuel, both in industry and in the home.The Department continues to supplement normal supplies of themain types of coal by means of its weekly programme for consigning170 trainloads of coal to London and the South.      The despatch offurther 19 trains has been arranged with the Ministry of transport to be fitted into the existing programme as and when circumstances permit.     These additional trains are intended partly to compensate for the withdrawal of a number of coastwise vessels which have been diverted to assist operations in Flanders.Exports.Owing to the internal pressure upon supplies as well as theincreased requirements of France, there is a great shortage of coal for neutral destinations.CorrespondingCoal Carpro Shipments.11th May18th   &quot;25th   &quot; (prov.)Bunkers for foreign going; vessels.11th May18 th   &quot;25th   &quot; (prov.)Week ended1940Tons640,100628,700518,500163,800140,400132,600Total Quantity of Coal Shipped Abroad.&quot;11th May18th   &quot;25th   &quot; (prov.)856,000820,700708,500week1939Tons807,200891,800935,500188,600&quot;1,00015,169,7001,066,1001,147,6001,192,700as including the coal equivalent of coke and manufactured fuel.
