MINISTRY   OF   FOODREPORT FOR APRIL, 1940SUPPLY. CONSUMPTION, STOCKS AND prices.     GENERAL NOTE ON SUPPLY position the supply position of the principal foods and animal feeds is shown intabular and graphic form in the appendix.HThe satisfactory stock position reported in the Seventh Report has been maintained for most commodities, but the invasion of Denmark in April immediatelyresulted in a marked reduction in imports of butter, bacon and eggs.     Inconsequence, the butter ration will be reduced from 8 ozs. to 4 ozs. on 3rd June,and the bacon ration will be reduced from 8 ozs. to 4 ozs. on 10th June.To avoid further depletion of sugar stocks, already approaching adangerously low level, the domestic ration will be reduced on 27th May from12 ozs. to 8 ozs.Stocks of meat continued i.o increase.     The reserve stock of wheat isequal to about 13 weeks1 consumption and is expected to be maintained at or above that level during the next few months.     Reserve stocks of feeding-stuffswill be built up during the summer months when consumption is low, if suppliespermit.The invasion of Holland will seriously reduce supplies of condensed milk, eggs and starch.     Nearly 7d?o of our normal imports of eggs came fromScandinavia and Holland.     Supplies are being drawn from alternative sources butthere is no hope of making good more than a fraction of the loss.     The loss ofcondensed milk supplies is even more serious.     Holland provided the bulk of our imports of sweetened condensed skimmed milk, which is mainly used by the poorersections of the population. ,  Alternative sources are being sought and thesubstitution of other types of milk is being  considered.     The loss of Dutchstarch is being offset by increased imports from the U.S.*  In the forecasts there given for May, June and July no allowance has been made for possible losses at sea.     As shipping tonnage has not yet been arranged for a large part of July, the predictions for that month must be regarded as less reliablethan those for May and June./2. WHEAT

2,     WHEAT AMD FLOUR(in terms of wheat)Total U.K, stocks on 4th May        ... ... 2,075,000 tons estimated weekly total consumption (May) ... 153,000   &quot;&quot; &quot;       flour &quot; (&quot;    ) ... 120,000   &quot;The reserve stock of wheat and flour at the end of April was equivalentto 12.7 weeks&apos;  supplyo   It is expected that the War Cabinet&apos;s instruction to accumulate a 13 weeks? reserve will be fully implemented by the end of May.     Nodifficulty is anticipated in maintaining the reserve stock at or above this level for the next few months.As a partial safeguard against present supplying countries increasing their export prices, permission has been obtained to purchase 10 million bushels ofwheat from the U.S.A.   There has, however, been a severe fall in overseas wheatprices since Germany occupied the Low Countries.3.     ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFFSMaize Barley        Oilcake&apos;000 tons total stocks in U.K. on 4th May 65 324 16Estimated weekly consumption (May) 44 28 26Imported cereal feeds continue to be in short supply.   Actual arrivals for january to April averaged only 73/5 of programme.     Anticipated arrivals in Mayand June are respectively 77/6 and 90)? of programme.-Thanks to the generosity of the U.S. Government in providing an exportsubsidy of about 50/5 (25 cents per bushel) , the Ministry has purchased, on june-October shipment, 650,000 tons of maizec     There is an enormous exportable surplus of maize in both the Argentine and the United States.     The loss of the scandinavian, Dutch and Belgian markets is a very severe blow to the Argentine,and it appears that only the intervention of the Government can prevent thedemoralization of their maize markets   As the U .S.Government will have loansoutstanding at the end of the present crop year on about 12 million tons of maize,it is highly improbable that their market will be unpegged.     In view of theabundant supply of all grains in North America, it is clear that the provision ofthe full requirements of feed grains necessary to maintain our livestockpopulation at its present level in the second year of war can be met if the constant conflict between shipping and financial considerations can be solved bycredits, or other means 5 which would enable us to draw a larger proportion of our needs from&apos; North America whence one boat can bring as much food to our shores ina year as two from Argentina or three from Australia./Treasury

Treasury approval has &quot;been obtained to requisition about 11,000 tons ofthe barley held by malt distillers in Scotland.     It is expected that practically all of this will be taken over and about one-half of it allocated to human food in the form of pot and pearl barley.Owing to the continued shortage of cereal feeds, 20,000 tons of Frenchwheat were released for stock feeding in April and 5,000 tons of other imported wheat for chicken feed.     The allocations of imported feed cereals (includingwheat) in April were maintained at 66$ of &quot;normal&quot; ( i.cone-twelfth of the1936/38 annual average) and similar allocations will be made in May.     Theallocation in June will be 55$ of the same &quot;normal&quot; , but allowing for the seasonal decline in consumption this change involves no reduction.Oilcakes were in improved supply in April, mainly because of increased home production.     The normal seasonal reduction in oilcake consumption in summer will permit a start to be made in May in building up a reserve stock.4.     SUGARTotal U.K, stocks on 4th&quot;May 408,000 tons estimated weekly consumption (May)        41,500 tons&quot; &quot; &quot; (June)       31,100 tonsThe decision to reduce as from 27th May the domestic ration from 12 ozs0to 8 ozs. per head per week will obviate a serious deterioration in the stock position.     This will also be helped by a further cut in July in the allocations to manufacturersj    this cut will be equivalent to 10$ of their pre-war supply,subject to special treatment of certain classes.     The estimated effect of the combined reductions will be to provide a bulk stock of 358,000 tons by the end ofJuly, an increase of over 60,000 tons compared with estimated stocks on the basisof present rations.   The saving up to the end of September, when stocks were expected to become dangerously low, will be about 115,000 tons.   These figures are based on the assumption that all shipments will arrive at the due dates andthey make no provision for any special demands which may arise from the influx of refugees, the spoliation of the Belgian and French beet crops or from otherenemy action.The possibility of purchasing 100,000 tons of sugar from Java, to be shipped in Dutch boats, is under consideration,/5.

While thereduction of both butter and bacon stocks will provide extra room in the coldstores for meat, the maximum cold storage capacity for meat during the summeris put at lSSjOOO^tons.     If, therefore, the present forecast of total stocks(viz. 200,000 tons) at the end of July materializes, no less than 45,000 tons would be in undischarged ships.     On the other hand, the following factors,quantitative allowances for which are difficult to make, may increase consumptionsubstantially above the current estimate and reduce stocks by a correspondingamount:     sinkings and other marine losses, extra French demands, increasedrequirements for our home and overseas forces, demands by refugees, possible assistance in provisioning the Belgian army.5.

Stocks of canned beef have been reserved for the use of the Servicesand to meet sudden emergencies consequent on air-raids.     Present stockswould meet the Services&apos; demands - at their current rate of consumption - for two years, but increased consumption must be expected and a further purchaseof 36,000 tons of canned beef from South American countries is being made.Other varieties of canned meat will also be purchased, but the quantity isnot likely to exceed 4,000 tons.6.  . BACON AND HAMTotal G.B. stocks on 4th May 44,000 tons estimated G. B. weekly consumption (May) 9,000     &quot;&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;        (July) 7,600    &quot;The effects of the invasion of Holland on our bacon supplies will be relatively small;   about 250 tons per week were expected from that countryout of estimated weekly aaports of 4,400 tons (allowing for the loss of Danishsupplies).     Reduced supplies are, however, expected from Northern Irelandand total future imports are now estimated at. 3,700 tons a week.     The bulk ofthis quantity (2,500 tons) is coming from Canada.In view of the reduction in supplies, and the fact that stocks areexpected shortly to decline to a level suitable to summer conditions, it hasbeen decided to re-introduce a 4 oz. ration on the 10th June, in place of thepresent 8 oz. ration.Prior to the invasion of Denmark by Germany, it was suggested thatthe quantities from Canada should be reduced in the next contract beginning inthe autumn and that the question should be explored with the Canadian authorities at a fairly early date.     Owing to the loss of the Danish supplies, no actionon these lines has been taken.     It is probable that to maintain a 4 oz. rationwe shall require supplies from Canada on the same scale, if not greater, than we are now receiving from that country.7.

of Holland, from which source the hulk of our imports of sweetened skimmedcondensed milk was obtainedc    This is the cheapest form of condensed milk;it is utilised mainly by the poorer consumers and is difficult to replace at short notices   Alternative sources of supply (including the U,S,A.) are underconsideration, and it is possible that the loss of Dutch supplies may in part bemade good by increasing home production,80   BUTTERTotal G6Ba stocks on 4th May 73,000 tons estimated CB. weekly consumption (May) 7,500   &quot;&quot; &quot;        M &quot; (June) 5,500   &quot;The loss of Danish supplies of butter will make it necessary to re-introduceas from 3rd June, a 4 oz, ration in plade of the present 8 oz, ration.   The 4 62iration can be maintained for a further few months, but the cessation of Dutch supplies will render a further reduction necessary not later than early next spring.   If bythe end of the winter the supply position is sufficiently acute, extra supplies could, no doubt, be obtained from U.3.Ao provided such a purchase could be financed.In the meantime, consumption will exceed imports and home production.   Stocks will bereduced by about 18,000 tons during the three months May-July.9o   CHEESETotal G0Bo stocks on 4th May   000     ...     21,000 tons estimated G0Bo weekly consumption (May)       4,000   &quot;The invasion of Holland vri.ll not affect the cheese position seriouslyand stocks are likely to be maintained at their present level during the next threemonths.   An agreement has been reached with the Canadian Authorities for the purchase(at 14 cents per lb. f.o.b. Montreal) of up to 35,000 tons of this season&apos;s cheese.This quantity is equal to the average annual imports from Canada during the past three years.It is proposed to establish maximum prices for imported cheese shortly.Suggestions of similar action for home-produced cheese have aroused strong opposition from certain trade interests but an Order has been made (22nd May, 1940),10.   EGGS )Denmark, Norway, Holland and Belgium accounted for nearly 75f0 of our imports of eggs in shell and, while home-produced supplies, now at theirseasonal peak, are available to relieve the immediate shortage, a serious/deficiency

deficiency tri.ll undoubtedly occur in the autumn when home-produced supplies are expected to be about 35$ below 19390 -Assuming the  fulfilment of the present purchasing programme which includes increased quantities from the Balkans, South America and the Dominions,it is estimated that total supplies of eggs, including home-produced, during july-December of this year, will be about two-thirds of the quantity available inthe corresponding months of 1939,,It is not considered practicable to ration eggs to the domestic consumer.The Ministry has re-imposed maximum prices for home-produced eggs in order toprevent an undue rise in price. .11.

Much of the deficiency, however,should be made good in JulyeThe stock positions of both hard and soft oils have also improved inthe past month. Linseed oil stocks, on the other hand, declined slightly and are considerably below 10 weeks1 requirements.   Supplies of linseed oil continue tobe restricted except to manufacturers of oilskins and gasproof clothing. In order to release adequate supplies of edible oils for the production of margarine it may benecessary to impose more severe restrictions on manufacturers of other foodstuffs, e.g,cakes, biscuits, confectionery, when the butter ration is reduced to 4 ozs. on June 3rd.Although very large supplies of whale oil are available, the facilities forhardening the oil have become more restricted, since the German occupation of holland prevents the utilisation by the United Kingdom of the Dutch hardeningplant.   Additional plant for the hardening of whale oil is being constructedto meet the increased demand for margarine, but will not become adequate to meet all our requirements until the end of the year0     In the meantime, it may benecessary to draw on stocks of hardened whale oil and to restrict the quantity/used

MARGARINE AND LARDSales of margarine in recent weeks indicate a marked falling off in demand as a result of the doubling of the butter ration on March 25th.   In thefour preceding weeks margarine sales averaged 6,400 tons per week, and in thefollowing four weeks only 5,500.   The demand is expected to return to about theformer level when the butter ration is reduced on June 3rd.To meet the demand for domestic cooking fat, increased quantities ofraw materials have been made available to manufacturers.   On the other hand,supplies for the manufacture of bakery compound lard and shortenings are being restricted to the pre-war leveloThe Government!s reserve stock of animal lard was nearly 7,000 tons at the end of April,   Of the 8,000 tons purchased from the U.S.A., 1,440 tonshave yet to arrive0   Negotiations are under way for the purchase of 1,500 tonsof lard from Eire annually.13.

may become too low for the needs of the Xmas trade unless the additionalpurchase of Australian fruit is made.16.   STARCHThe import programme for starch has been completely upset by the invasion of Holland and Belgium whence we expected to draw 44$ of our total imports.In consequence, we shall have to import at the rate of an additional. 50,000 tons ayear from the U.S.A., and the balance from other sources, including the Dutch east indies.17.   FOOD prices the Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of retail food prices rose one pointduring April, making a total rise since September 1st of 21 points or 15$.   Thiswas mainly due to an increase of ^d to -gd each in the average price of eggs,attributable to the invasion of Denmark.   There were only slight changes in someof the other items; a rise of about l/5th pence per 7 lbs.- in the price of potatoes was not sufficient to affect the published average price, which is quotedto the nearest ^d..     There was a slight decline in the price of milk, whichlowered by ^d the average published price per quart.The supply of eggs will be decreased further by the invasion of Holland,Maximum retail prices of home-produced eggs were reintroduced on May 14th, theprices of imported eggs being already subject to control.     Some further risein egg prices will almost certainly occur in the next few months, in accordancewith the usual seasonal trend.     There is, however, unlikely to be much changebefore the end of May.     No immediate change of any magnitude is in prospect forother foods included in the index.   But there should be some seasonal declinein the prices of cheese, which will probably be more noticeable now that theMaximum Prices Order, has come into force.18.   ACTIVITIES OF ANGLO-FRENCH FOOD EXECUTIVEThe Anglo-French Food Executive submitted, on 11th May, to the Anglo-French Shipping Executive the first year of war food import programmes for thetwo countries; the global totals being 19,852,000 tons for the United Kingdomand 7,000,000 tons for France.&apos;   The figures have been examined in consultationwith the Chairman of the Anglo-French Co-ordinating Committee and the Ministryof Shipping.Owing to the serious shipping arrears in the first six months of war,/the

the Anglo-French Food Executive has drawn the attention of the ShippingExecutive to the special priority required (a) for the completion of the fullFrench programme in respect of groundnuts and linseed and (b) one-half of that programme for rice.19c    EFFECTS OF THE INVASION OF BELGIUM AND THE NETHERLANDSThe Ministry of Food planned to import only 4,000 tons of foods (mainlyglucose and vegetables) from Belgium during the period April-August 1940.     the invasion of Belgium will therefore cut off a negligible fraction of our food imports.The influx of Belgian refugees will, however, increase the demands made on oursupply of foods.The invasion of the Netherlands will have a serious effect upon our supplies of certain foods, particularly sweetened condensed skim milk, onions,eggs and starch.    Since the outbreak of war the Ministry have greatly reduced their dependence on Holland as a source of supply of certain foods (e.g. butter and bacon).   Nevertheless, the Ministry had planned to import during April-August1940 about 107,000 tons of foods from the Netherlands, about 34,000 tons of whicharrived before the invasion.    The total loss may, therefore, be put at 73,000 tons.The specific effects on supply of the invasion of Holland are dealt with under the heading of the appropriate commodities.The Netherlands normally supplies about I5 million cases of condensedwhole milk to our colonies annually, approximately 5/8ths of their total imports.While it may be necessary to export a proportion of our domestic production ofthis category to make up part of the deficiency, suggestions have already beenmade not only to encourage production in the Dominions, but to supply the west indies from Canada, and to supply Malaya, Hong Kong and Borneo from Australiaand New Zealand.

REPORT ON FOOD PRODUCTION(By the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries inconjunction with the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Secretary of State for the Home Department )0Ploughing Up campaign in England and Wales 1,453,000 acres of grassland had &quot;beenploughed up by April 15th0     (This includes 103,000 acres ploughed up priorto the outbreak of war.)In Scotland the additional, acreage ploughed up for sowing to cropsis probably over 200,000 acres0A more recent return received from Northern Ireland indicates that270,000 acres have been ploughed for sowing to crops0The final figure is not likely to differ substantially from theoriginal aim of 2,000,000 acres, of which England and Wales are likely tocontribute 1,500,000, Scotland over 200?000 and Northern Ireland 270,000 acres.In all three countries conditions have been favourable for ploughing,cultivating and sowing during the past month0Conferences have been held with Chairmen of the County war agricultural Executive Committees on questions affecting the food productioncampaign for 1940/41,Crop Conditions;     Great Britain0The autumn sown wheat, most of which survived the winter, has,except on heavy land, considerably improved in condition, but autumn sownbeans, oats and barley have suffered heavily.Spring corn (including the bulk of the oats,, barley, peas and beans)has been sown under favourable conditions, but there are reports of damage from wireworm and leather jacket.     Potatoes have been or are being plantedunder good conditions, and the preparation of the land for root crops isprogressing favourably.     All the crops mentioned in this paragraph are,however, backward for the time of the year, or the preparation of the landfor them is backward, owing to the prolonged winter and general congestion of farm operations.Clover/

Clover and other temporary grasses though healthy and vigorousare backward, and on permanent pastures the quantity of grass is small forthe time of the year.     The condition of pastures is, howeverP improving.Cattle and sheep are in better condition t han might have been expected from the shortage of feeding stuffs, and the fall of lambs has been satisfactory.     Mortality among ewes and lambs has, however, been ratherheavy, but the condition of the flocks is improving - though still poor inScotlandoMan PowerTo alleviate the shortage of regular workers which is alreadyevident in many districts and the shortage of casual workers which is in prospect p the following steps are being taken:   the War Office have agreed in principle to allow agricultural furloughs and are considering proposals to enable farmers to obtain the help of soldiers from neighbouring units for harvesting, and for the formation of &quot;agricultural military companies&quot;.The holiday farming camp scheme for public and secondary schoolboys is beingworked cut in detail and the scheme for facilitating the employment of boysleaving school will shortly be introduced,    University students are beingrecruited for harvesting during the vacation.     County Councils are being asked to release roadmen for temporary agricultural work    Arrangementsfor placing conscientious objectors in agricultural work will shortly beput into operation.     It is being considered whether they can be given courses of training.Four hundred applications for postponement have resulted from the april 6th registration.     Some six thousand members of the Women&apos;s land army are now on farms (274 in Scotland) and farmers&apos; demand for them hasincreased and broadened cut from dairy work to many other classes of work.Fresh recruiting is being undertaken and arrangements are being made for thetraining of the recruits.     The response to the recruiting campaign for the auxiliary Force of seasonal women workers has been disappointing, only some250 having been so far enrolled (34 in Scotland) 0When outstanding proposals for wage increases beoome effective, theaverage statutory minimum wage in England and Wales will have increased by10 per cent, since September last, reaching 38/4d0     The Agricultural wages board/

Board are considering the national minimum to be fixed under the recent Act,and are consulting the County Committees thereon.With regard to the shortage of housing accommodation for agricultural workers, it has been arranged that where lodging surveys are undertaken in rural districts in connection with new factory proposals, steps will be takento reserve accommodation for the agricultural workers.Feeding StuffsWith the advent of the grass feeding season more feeding stuffs have become available for pigs and poultry.     The instructions given to the distributive trade to make more feeding stuffs available in straight formhave been warmly welcomed.     Good progress has been made in the preparation ofa scheme for introducing standardised compounds and mixtures.     Scottishpoultry farmers have objected to the supply of feeding stuffs to Eire whenthey themselves were not receiving full supplies.The increasing difficulties with regard to shipping will probablynecessitate substantial modifications in the programme for imported feedingstuffs.     The implications from the agricultural point of view, especially ifit proves to be impossible to carry out the present intention of building up a reserve this summer against next winter&apos;s requirements, are being examined.Since the close of the period covered by this Report increasedmaximum prices for feeding stuffs have been announced without simultaneousprovision being made for compensating increases in the selling prices of the farmers&apos; produce.     This has already given rise to protests from the farmers.LivestockThe Scottish Farmers1 Union have submitted a reasoned case for anincrease in the basic price of fat cattle by 5/- per live cwt. and of fatsheep and lambs by 2d. per lb.     It is understood that a similar claim isto be submitted by the English N.F.U,Owing to the loss of supplies of bacon and eggs from scandinavia and Holland and Belgium, and to the higher prices of eggs, pig and poultryfarmers are expecting that production in this country will be encouraged.Poultry farmers in particular are increasing their hatchings.     In view of the inevitable shortage of imported feeding stuffs during next winter - particularlycereals/

cereals, which are needed in large quantities by the pig and poultry industries -steps will have to be taken to counteract this tendency.Milk production the following figures relate to the United Kingdom in million gallons:-Liquid Manufacturing TotalApril 1939 71,6 &apos; 35,5 107o0March 1940 73,6 19,0 92,6April 1940 71.7 25,1 9609The decrease in the total compared with last year is somewhatexaggerated by reason of production in April 1939 being better than average.An analysis by groups of counties in England and Wales had disclosed thatduring the winter months the grassland areas showed the greatest decline j withthe growth of grass during the summer the position is likely to be improved,especially in the grassland areas,Animal HealthThere has been only one outbreak of foot and mouth disease sincethe last Report.     The swine fever position has not improved.     The area underrestriction in the Eastern Counties has been reduced but a new area has been added in Aberdeenshire,
