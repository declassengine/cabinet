3HDIETRIAL RELATIONS.1.     Although increases in wages rates continue to be reported, there appearsfor the moment to be a certain slackening in the momentum of the upward move-ment.     The recent increases are, in the main, consequential on those already given in the major industries and affect comparatively small numbers of work-people.     There are some cases in which a second increase in wages since theoutbreak of war has been granted, but it is only in a few industries that thesesecond increases have had the effect of bringing the total increase above thegeneral level of increases in industry as a whole.     A number of additionalincreases have been granted as the result of the operation of cost of livingscales in various industries.2.     The Industrial Court has issued an Award regarding the wages of womenconductors employed by municipal transport undertakings in place of maleconductors serving with the Forces.     One of the terms of the Award is that women conductors of 21 years and over who have served for not less than six months shall receive the scale of pay and increments applicable to adultmale conductors.     On the other hand the guaranteed week in the case of womenhas been fixed at 40 hours as compared with 48 hours in the case of men, andit is a matter of agreement that the Award is in respect of women conductorsemployed to replace men for the period of the war only and until such time asthe men return to their employment.     Nevertheless this Award may be regardedas of significance in its bearing upon the claim made in some quarters that women who take over men&apos;s work should receive the same pay as the men.3.     A development of interest has taken place in connection with the regula-tion of wages of production workers in the iron and steel and associatedindustries where heretofore fluctuations have been based upon a sliding scaleaccording to variations in the selling price.     Under control and war conditions certain artificial factors enter into the selling price and agree-ment has recently been reached in the heavy steel trade whereby, for the duration of the war, the selling price basis will be dropped and a cost ofliving sliding scale will be utilised in its place.     Agreements on similar lines have been reached, or are being negotiated, in associated trades,e.g., blast furnaces and tin plate.

4.     A Court of Inquiry has been appointed under Part 2 of the industrial courts Act, 1919, in connection v/ith a dispute affecting maintenancecraftsmen in iron and steel works on the North East Coast.     The unionsrepresenting these craftsmen had for a considerable period before the warbeen pressing various claims for improvements in wages and working conditionsincluding a claim for an increase in their base rates.     After protractednegotiation, during which the issues became somewhat confused and whichfailed to result in agreement, the unions in December last placed an embargo on overtime.     The matter was recently reported to the Ministry by the Ironand Steel Trades Employers&apos; Association, which stated that the continuanceof the embargo was likely to have a serious effect on the production of essential steel.     Lengthy discussions with representatives of bo*th sidesfailed to reach a settlement and as it was not found possible to get thematter submitted to arbitration;    it was decided to appoint a Court of Inquiry.5.     The dispute in the dyeing and bleaching industry, to which reference wasmade in the last Report, assumed a serious aspect when, as the result of a ballot among the workpeople, totalling some 80,000, notices to cease workearly in May were handed in, and at the same time notice was given of adecision to cease to work overtime from 30th April.     In view of the serious-ness of the situation steps were taken by my Department with a view to bringing about a resumption of negotiations, as a result of which a settlementhas now been reached.6.     Consideration has been given recently by a number of Departments to the relation between hours of work, fatigue and output.     It was establishedduring the last war and is now generally accepted that excessive hours of work,whether by way of continuous overtime or absence of holidays, tend in the longrun to retard rather than to increase production.     The principal supply departments have agreed the following general statement of policy:It is agreed that the object of securing maximum production inwar-time is promoted rather than hiiidered by allowing workers to have theusual intervals for rest and recreation, and in particular by theirhaving, as far as may be practicable, annual holidays of the usual extent.Any curtailment of holidays should be confined to cases where the specialcircumstances make this unavoidable.

The annual holiday of a week should, wherever practicable, be taken  in one spell and not he broken up into two or more spells.With the object of reducing the numbers of workers taking holidaysat any one time, arrangements should be made for spreading holidaysover as large a part of the year as possible, and, in any event, overthe period from May to October, inclusive.     The adoption of a rotasystem in individual establishments is one method of aohieving this.Where such a system is not appropriate, and it is considered necessaryto close a whole establishment for the period of the holiday, suitable arrangements should be agreed upon in consultation between those concerned, in order to avoid on the one hand the congestion which wouldresult if too many establishments close at the same time, and on the otherhand any dislocation in the flow of production which might result from lack of co-ordination in the holiday plans of a number of inter-dependantfactories.In the case of coal mining there are special considerations which may requiresomewhat different treatment and the position there is being handled by the mines Department.RATES OP WAGES AMD COST OP LIVING.7.     On the basis of the information available to the Ministry of Labour and national Service it is estimated that the average level of rates of wages atthe end of March, 1940, was about 8 per cent, higher than at the end ofAugust, 1939, as compared with between 7 and 7-g- per cent, at the end ofFebruary.     These figures relate to rates of wages, and take no account of increases in earnings due to improved employment, overtime work, or theextension of systems of payment by results, as to which comprehensivestatistics are not available.

8.     The official cost of living index figure at 1st April, 1940,was 78 per cent, above the level of July, 1914, as compared with79 per cent, at 1st March, 1940, and 55 per cent, at 1st September, 1939.The rise of 23 points since 1st September, 1939, is equivalent toabout 15 per cent.The fall of 1 point in the index figure during March was due mainly to a sharp decline in the prices of eggs.     Among other items,the principal changes during the month were increases, averaging about per cent., in the prices of clothing.9.     The following Table shows the percentage,   rise in the index figuresfor (a) food and (b) cost-of-living generally, since the beginning ofSeptember, 1939.

BffLOYMENT AND UNSiPLOYMENT.10.   There has &quot;been a further substantial improvement in unemployment.     Thenormal monthly count taken on 15th April recorded a reduction of 148,519 inthe numbers on the Register as compared with 11th March last.     This follows a reduction on that date of 382,887 as compared with the previous month.11.    The total number of men wholly unemployed on 15th April was 538,570.The weekly returns since that date indicate that this number is steadilyfalling.     In some Divisions the reserves of wholly unemployed labour arenearing exhaustion.     For example, in the Midlands Division, which includesBirmingham and Coventry, out of an insured population of 1,411,920, the totalnumber of wholly unemployed men was only 17,977.     In the North MidlandsDivision the corresponding figures were 1,008,910 insured population,23,499 wholly unemployed men.     There is therefore no adequate reserve of male labour in those areas, and additional labour will need to be imported from other areas or obtained by transfer from less essential branches ofproduction or from sources normally outside the industrial field.     This isan important fact to be borne in mind when considering the location of nowcapacity or extensions. ^12.   At the next count to be taken on 20th May, arrangements are being madefor an analysis according to the duration of unemployment.     It is hoped fromthis to be able to form some estimate of the numbers who can be reckoned asan available reserve and how many are simply passing from one job to another.In this connection, it is to be noted that an analysis made on 11th Marchshowed, that over 42$ of the wholly unemployed men are aged 50 and over.Only in London and certain relatively vulnerable areas where unemployment isheaviest is the percentage much below that figure.The position in particular industries is as follows:-Engineering and Shipbuilding.13.   The discussions with the two Sides of the industries are proceeding.    Inthe shipbuilding industry arrangements are being made for a review of the registers, which it is hoped will assist in the task of finding skilled workers to make good shortages that are occurring.     In the engineering industry larger numbers of trainees from Government Training Centres are beingengaged     and the     training and upgrading of semi-skilled and unskilled workers is proceeding.     A marked increase in the working of overtime andextra night shifts has been reported.5.

14.   There has been further improvement in the industry generally and thenumbers registered as unemployed have decreased substantially in many areas.The transport difficulties which had caused a considerable amount of short time working appear to have been removed and the loss of the Norwegian andDanish markets has not as yet adversely affected employment in collieriesnormally exporting to these countries.     Increases in absenteeism have beenreported in several districts and it is understood that local action is beingtaken by the industry in an endeavour to check this tendency.     In view ofthe unsatisfied demand for skilled workers in many coal mining areas, reviews of the unemployment registers are being undertaken in these areas in association with representatives of employers and workpeople.     wherever possible, the work will be undertaken by Interviewing Panels who will see themen with the object of determining the extent to which they can now be placedin mining employment.     Reviews have already commenced and it is hoped tocomplete them by the end of May.Textiles.15.   Employment in the cotton industry has continued to improve and the numberof cotton operatives registered in Lancashire has further declined.Representatives of the industry have been considering the position with regardto the demands for skilled weavers and other workpeople, and it has beendecided to undertake reviews of the unemployment registers in Lancashire onsomewhat the same lines as those described for the coal mining industry.Shipping Services.16.   On the whole the position with regard to the supply of seamen has easedconsiderably and the demands for deck ratings have been substantially met.Special attention is being given to the possibility of men being required toman Danish and Norwegian ships.     The detailed review of the seamen&apos;sregisters, to which reference has been made in previous reports, is just about to begin, in agreement with the Ministry of Shipping, Shipping Federation andthe National Union of Seamen.     It is hoped that it will yield valuableinformation as to the reserves of labour available for sea-going employment.Building.17.   During the month of April unemployment among both skilled and unskilled workers continued to diminish;   in most of the skilled occupations and amonglabourers there are now substantially fewer men unemployed than a year ago.6.

18.   The simultaneous execution of the Government&apos; s emergency building programmeof factories, hutted camps and depots and of extensive air raid precautionsschemes for Local Authorities is placing considerable strain upon the reserves of labour in the industry, particularly in the north west and south west ofEngland.     The alternative methods of construction now adopted on all war timebuildings in order to economise timber and steel have resulted in shortages ofbricklayers and the relative under-employment of carpenters and joiners.   Theshortages of bricklayers, which are being most acutely felt in areas wherethere are large concentrations of Government and A.R.P. work (such as thenorth west of England), are being met to-a considerable extent by the long distance transfer of skilled men.     The demand on urgent Government work is however still increasing and though some bricklayers may be expected to be released from A.R.P. work nearing completion on the East Coast, furtherdifficulties are to be expected.19.   The Works and Building Priority Subcommittee has appointed a specialSub-Committee to report upon the planning of the Government building programme and the questions of priority involved in its execution in the light ofshortages of essential materials and certain types of skilled labour.Agriculture.20.   Farmers are resorting to long overtime and even to night work in their efforts to carry out the programme for increased cultivation and to make upfor time lost during the bad weather.     At the same time the supply of available labour is becoming very scarce:    Scotland, North Western, Midlands,Eastern and South Western Divisions all comment upon the fact that all labourexcept that of very poor quality. seems to have been absorbed, and NorthernDivision reports that although some experienced workers are still unemployedthey are mostly under contracts to begin work at the May term.21.    It is very likely that the heavy demands for additional workers,particularly casual workers, will have to be met in the main from the specialsources of labour which the Agriculture Departments are organising, such asthe Women&apos;s Land Army, school boy camps, etc.     The success of these measures will depend upon the willingness of farmers to take on labour with lessexperience and skill than they usually require.Forestry.22.   There are reports from many Divisions of vacancies, particularly forfellers and sawyers, which remain unfilled.     In part the difficulties are due to low wages and unattractive conditions compared with alternative employment open to the applicants.

23,     Expansion programmes undertaken earlier are now beginning to take effect,and the number of equipped places for the training of civilians in government training Centres will within a fewwaeks rise to about 9,500.     This increase hasbeen made possible owing to a certain number of machine tools and other equipment becoming available which it has not hitherto been possible to obtain.It will not, however, be possible to fill that increased number of equippedplaces without over 150 more instructors, though the position is for themoment slightly easier as regards the supply of these.     If all the expansionsin hand come into full operation, i.e., over the next few months, the numberof places should rise to over 16,000.     These extra places will be providedpartly by double shifts in certain classes (if sufficient instructors become available), and partly by expansions and extensions at existing Centres.     Itwill not be possible to expand beyond 16,000 without additional Training Centres.Proposals for additional Centres are under active consideration.24.     The difficulty of obtaining recruits for the Centres has again become ananxiety.     In the month of March, despite the incidence of the Easter   holiday,there was an average number of 1,177 unemployed men applying for training each week;   whereas in the month of April the average number of weekly applicationswas only 595 and the number of applicants applying during the week ending27th April had fallen to 493, and this in spite of unremitting efforts to recruit every eligible man.     On 25th April there were in training 7, 683 civiliansat the main Centres, and 647 at the smaller Centres, which is a higher figure...than has been reached before, but it is clear that unless special steps are taken it will be quite impossible to fill the Training Centres to full capacity in view of the increased number of places becoming available.     At presentthe applicants are confined to the unemployed, and with the fall in thenumbers of unemployed and the calling up of further age groups to the armed forces, the field of recruitment on the present basis is becoming progressively reduced.     Moreover, the remaining unemployed contain a high and growingproportion of men who are not up to the standard suitable for this form oftraining.     Consideration therefore is being given to meeting this problem intwo ways:   first by improving the financial conditions under which men are

trained, and thus rendering the attractions of training more comparable with those of unskilled work in the engineering industry at the ratesprevailing at present;    secondly by opening the field of recruitment notonly to the unemployed but also to men at present employed in non-essential industries.RECRuTTBIG.25.   Two further registrations were held under the National Service(Armed Forces) Act during April.     The result of the one on 6th April.was included in the previous Report.     The second, which was held on 27th April,related to men not already registered bom between 1st January, 1915, and27th April, 1920, both dates inclusive.     The number of men registered was312,912,  of whom 5,838 or 1,23 per cent were provisionally registered asconscientious objectors.     This is the lowest figure recorded forconscientious objectors since the introduction of compulsory recruitment to the Forces.26.   The registration of the next age group (men born between 1st January,1912and 25th May, 1920) on 25th May will almost exhaust the groups covered bythe Proclamation made on 1st January, 1940.     A further Proclamation wastherefore, made on 9th May, making liable to be called up for service men whoon that date had reached the age of 19 but not 37.     It is estimated thatthe number of men thus made liable for service will exceed 2,500,000.27.   During the month 38,215 men were posted under the Act for service withthe Army, making a total of approximately 405,000 since the introduction of compulsory recruiting to the Forces.   The comparable totals for theRoyal Navy and Royal Air Force are now 25,063 and 15,740 respectively.28.   The most recent figures show that 12,063 decisions have been given bythe local tribunals which have been set up to decide the applications of mento be registered as conscientious objectors.     Analysed by categories, the*decisions were as follows:-Registered unconditionally as conscientious objectors   -   1,439 (l2/o)Registered conditionally for civilian work -   5,294 (44%)Registered for non-combatant duties in the armed forces     -   3,098 (26%)Applications dismissed -   2,232 (18%)12,0639. -

The Appellate Tribunal for England and Wales has considered a total of916 appeals.     In 614 cases the appeal has been dismissed, while in 302 casesthe decision of the local tribunals has been revised.     The Scottish Divisionof the Appellate Tribunal has so far heard 175 appeals, and in 66 cases thedecision of the local tribunals has been varied.29.    The most recent figures show that 27,918 applications based on grounds of exceptional hardship have been made for postponement of the liability to be called up for service under the Act.     In 17,361 cases the applicationfor a postponement certificate has been granted either by officers acting on behalf of the Minister or by the Military Service (Hardship) Committees.The remaining cases numbering 10,557 have been refused.     1,040 appealsagainst these decisions have been made to the Umpire, 667 by the Minister and373 by the applicant.     The latest figures show that of the decisions givenby the Umpire 150 were in favour of and 138 against the applicant.SCHEDULE OF RESERVED OCCUPATIONS.30.   Numerous amendments have TJeen made to the Schedule of Reserved Occupationsduring the month, affording a greater measure of reservation to many essentialoccupations.     Among the more important groups   are estimating engineersjplanning engineers, and occupations in the electricity supply industry;asbestos goods manufacture;   glass manufacture and leather tanning.31.    In order to meet the urgent and immediate needs of the Services, it hasbeen decided, after consultation with the appropriate employers and workpeople&apos;organisations, to raise the age of reservation from 23 to 25 in respect of motor fitters, motor mechanics, garage hands (mechanics); and road testers(motor car and motor cycle). The new age will be operative from 1st June, 1940.32.   Consideration is also being given to raising the reservation age fora number of other occupations, including Local Government staffs and membersof the teaching profession, and temporary Civil Servants appointed since 1st September, 1939.

33.    It has been decided, in consultation with the Ministry of Health,that members of the medical profession may be called up for service intheir professional capacity.     Holders of full time teaching appointmentsare, however, at present reserved if of or over the age of 25.     special arrangements are in force -whereby the Central Medical War Committee andthe corresponding Scottish Committee, subject to the review of theappropriate Government Departments, advise in the light of the medicalneeds of the civilian population, on the application to doctors of theirliability to service with H.M. Forces.     Medioal men, irrespective of agemay volunteer for service in their professional capacity.34.   It has been decided to relax the operation of the Schedule of reserved Occupations to permit unemployed persons in reserved occupations,who have been unemployed continuously for a period of not less than two months (other than by reason of sickness or suspension from work) andare not likely immediately to -be placed in employment in their reserved occupations^ to join the Armed Forces as volunteers, or to enrol forwhole-time Civil Defence work.(Intd.)
