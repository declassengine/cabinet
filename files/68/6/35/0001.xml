In the margin beside the items are placed percentage figures showing their comparative importancein relation to the total propaganda directed to (1) the German home popula-tion; (2) Great Britain; (3) France; and (4) neutral countries. In bracketsafter each figure is shown the corresponding percentage for the previousfortnight.A table is then given summarising these percentages.The course of German propaganda during the fortnight under review was sharply divided into two parts by the invasion of Holland and Belgiumon the 10th May. During the first part there was a striking increase in thegeneral theme of A Hied Unscrupulousness and a corresponding decline in themain themes of German Strength, Military Operations and Allied Weakness.After the 10th May this process was reversed. The importance of AlliedVnscrupulousness declined abruptly, while the other themes, led by Military.Operations, rose steadily. At the same time the proportion of anti-french to anti-British propaganda increased.The order of importance of the principal lines of German propaganda during the whole fortnight was : 1. Military Operations.2. British Weakness (mainly military).3. German Strength (mainly military).4. British Brutality (mainly desire to extend the war).The invasion of the Low Countries was preceded by a very great volumeof propaganda asserting that the Allies were about to extend the war to10813-10   [21328] B
South-Eastern Europe. It appears that such a propaganda feint generallyprecedes every- German surprise move. In the present instance the firstsuggestion of a threat to the Low Countries appeared in the evening of the8th May, and was given little prominence. In the case of the invasion of scandinavia, although the bulk of German propaganda pointed in thedirection finally taken, action was immediately preceded by the sensational&quot; discovery &quot; of a British attempt at sabotage &quot;on the Danube. Similarly, inthe publicity given to Germany&apos;s &quot; secret weapon.&quot; no reference was made toflame-throwing tanks and only the slightest mention of very heavy tanks.1. German Strength.Germnny, 21% The importance of this theme has declined in propaganda to Germany,Britain 18% a6i%) but has increased to other countries. Concentration upon military strengthFrance,&apos;;i3%.:(i2j%/) has been even greater than hitherto, and this topic now occupies over two-Neutrals, 18%     (   thirds of the total theme.(161%) From the lst-9th May the core of the argument was the superiority ofthe German Air Force over the British Navy&quot; as illustrated by the sinking of a battleship off Namsos by a single bomb. This proved that a cataclysmicrevolution in the science of war had taken place. Germany was now in aposition to transfer the theatre of war into the air over the British Isles.Adolf Hitler&apos;s Norwegian campaign would go down in world history as oneof the most decisive military actions of all time.An interesting undertone of German propaganda, which came to the surface on the 8th May, was the assertion that Germany&apos;s leaders were nevertaken unawares. If a stroke was in preparation against the reich, germany had two counter-strokes ready for immediate use.From the 10th May onwards attention was concentrated upon Germany&apos;slightning counter-blow against the criminal plans of the Western aggressors.Germany did not tolerate that the enemy should take the initiative even fora. single hour.The capture of Eben-Emael, one of the strongest fortresses guardingLiege, was given great prominence as a strategic miracle, made possible only by co-operation between the air force and the army, and by the use of a newweapon of warfare. The strongest fortress in the world had fallen on thefourth dayr to the counter-attack of the German army, and its fall cast doubtsupon the impregnability of the Maginot Line.The capture of the &quot; Fortress Holland &quot; was another tribute to thepower of German arms. &quot; In five days you have attacked a strong, well-prepared army, which was established behind seemingly unconquerableobstacles, thrown its air force out of action, and finally compelled it to surrender.&quot; This victory had been made possible by the heroic and fearlessGerman parachutists. &apos;&apos; Not only have all the calculations of our enemy beennullified, but the measure of success has also transcended our own considerableexpectations.&quot; &quot; We are using new and terrible weapons, the nature ofwhich you may perhaps guess, but cannot know weapons which willrevolutionise the conditions of warfare and in comparison with which old-fashioned armaments are as bows and arrows. We are employing tacticaland strategical methods which have no precedent.&quot; The story of the secretweapon was given special prominence in propaganda abroad, and wasembroidered by hints of a secret ray, which rendered weapons useless, asBelgian gunners had discovered to their cost at Eben-Emael.Propaganda to neutral countries asserting the omnipotence of, Germanarms may be illustrated by a quotation from a leaflet distributed in yugoslavia : &quot; England and France guaranteed Czecho-Slovakia; Germanyoccupied Czecho-Slovakia. England and France made a pact with poland to encircle the Reich. Germany has purely and simply destroyed Poland.To-day, Norway and Denmark must recognise the omnipotence of Germany.Neutrals ! Recognise the power of Germany before it is too late.&quot;The only other subject of importance was1 the support of Italy,illustrated by the arrival of the new Ambassador Alfieri and by the visit ofthe Italian Propaganda Minister to Berlin. The sympathy of Russia wasonly- given passing mention.Germany&apos;s immunity to the blockade, and other economic topics, were almost entirely neglected.
2. Military Operations.This theme, which fell sharply between the 2nd and the 9th May, rose g^fn^l^Sfsteadily after the invasion of the Low Countries. .       France,&apos;24% (30%)Military subjects, comprising German Military Strength, Military Neutrals, 23*%Operations and Allied Military Weakness, occupied the following propor- (30%)tions of the whole of German propaganda : Per Cent.To Germany    ...       ...      ...      ...       ...      ...      54To Britain&quot;    ..................      52To France       ...      ...      ...      ...       ...      ...      57To Neutrals    ..................      52Up till the 10th May most emphasis was placed upon the successfulemployment of aircraft against British ships.    Before the 3rd May,according to a D.N.B. announcement, 135 units of the British Fleet had been -destroyed or put out of action.  Scarcely a day passed without the destructionor damaging of a battleship, cruiser or aircraft carrier.After the 10th May the invasion of the Low Countries naturallymonopolised this theme. The item given greatest prominence was thecapitulation of Holland on the evening of the 14th May. The capture of the fortress Eben-Emael and the penetration into Liege was also given greatpublicity, extending over several days, and used as a text for assertions thatGermany&apos;s Air Force and her new methods of attack had succeeded inrendering obsolete the type of fortification in which France had put hertrust, Other events of importance were: the occupation of the whole of north Holland within two days; the penetration of the &apos;&apos; Fortress Holland &apos;&apos;announced on the morning of the 14th; the crossing of the Meuse on to french territory and the breaking of the Maginot Line, announced on the15th; the surrender of Rotterdam; and the first large-scale tank battle,which ended as a victory for the German j:anks and Air Force.The destruction of Allied aircraft was given much less prominence. Therelative losses of the German Air Force had been so light that Germany&apos;salready enormous superiority in the air had been greatly increased. Thedestruction of Allied shipping by air attacks was a constant item, though of minor importance.The picture of Germany&apos;s military success presented by her propagandahas been one of an uninterrupted and irresistible advance which the bravestresistance might delay for a few hours, but could never check. Theimpression has been conveyed that Germany is employing new methods and weapons of warfare which render her success as certain as was that of thefirst firearms over bows and arrows. Germany, having produced a revolutionin everything else, had now brought about a revolution in the art of war.The invasion of the Low Countries brought a striking development inthe technique used in dealing with military operations. While theCommuniques of the German Supreme Command remained factual, therewas an increase in the number of expert military appreciations in the press and radio. Broadcast interviews with members of the armed forcesdescribed operations while they were still &quot;news.&quot; At the same time, the&quot;Propaganda Companies&quot; have tended more and more to monopolise thereporting of individual military operations in the press. According to theofficial organ of the German Press Association, &quot; The New Age, which has created new methods of warfare, has also created a new type of front linereporter. The new German war reporter who takes part in the night patrolis first of all a soldier; he is first of all a soldier when he flies towardsEngland; he is first of all a soldier when he chases Britons in a U-boat. Heis a soldier, a fighter. And only then is he a war reporter.&quot; For the homepopulation,^ the actuality and intensity of home propaganda on militaryoperations has been further increased by the provision of long news reelstaken at the,front and rushed home for immediate release. Dramatic effect in wireless propaganda has been increased by the extended use of specialannouncements of military successes, breaking into the middle of programmes, and preceded or followed by fanfares and military music[21328] *  b 2
3. Neutrals Oppose Allies.Gorman, 2% (i%) The increase in this theme was due entirely to e^Phasi^^nthea^C^Britain, 2% (.%) ODposition of Italy. Publicity was given to Italian demonstrations againstrr^foiTx^ thrimbeTrable tyranny of the blockade, and to anti-British posters, pressNeutralS&apos;2/0 (1/o)    moteks and speeches.   Great Britain was endeavouring to subject Italy,no less than Germany, to an intolerable tutelage.Germany, 13.%(12*%)Britain, 20. % (24%)France, 22% (15%)Neutrals, 19%(15.%)4. British Weakness.The importance of this theme has increased (except in propaganda toGreat Britain), and there has been a further concentration upon militarysubjects at the cost of all other topics except that of internal politicalweakness. .Up to the 9th May military weakness was illustrated by the Britishdefeat in Norway! &quot; Surely no military enterprise has ever ended in a moredismal defeat, and no dismal defeat has ever been more disgracefully andshamelessly announced. Each withdrawal is a victory. The successfulembarkation at Andalsnes is a unique way of describing the wild flightand abandonment of countless supplies.&quot; Chamberlain&apos;s speech was thesombre confession of a bankrupt who had staked his country in a mad ventureand had lost.After her defeat in Norway Great Britain had attempted to restoreher prestige by a diversion in the Mediterranean. The truth was that theBritish Fleet had been sent to Alexandria for safety. The Fleet had shown itself to be a collection of white elephants. No armour plating could savethese mammoths from the destructive blows of the young German Air Force and no armour plating could ward off the dangers now brought to Britain&apos;sthreshold.After the invasion of the Low Countries on the 10th May four dayselapsed before special attention was paid to Allied military weakness.The fall of Holland meant that England was completely exposed tothe German Air Force. A parachute psychosis was said to be alreadyspreading, and has been encouraged by German propaganda. The Allied AirForce had shown no initiative. Even Mr. Churchill was unable to promiseanything except blood, tears and sweat. Germany now had her hands onEngland&apos;s throat. The British nation was forced to prepare itself for aterrible attack, such as history had never known.The importance of the sub-theme of internal political weaknessincreased, although it was only one-quarter as important as militaryweakness. It sprang into prominence at the time of the debate on theBritish withdrawal from Norway, and died away soon after the ministerialchanges. Mr. Lloyd George was quoted on the ineptitude and indecision ofthe Government, and Mr. Chamberlain was accused of complacency in the face of failure. Democracy was incapable of providing effective leadership.The appointment of Mr. Churchill as Prime Minister was the summoning ofthe last reserves. Mr. Churchill was fighting for the defence of an era thatwas doomed to pass away. &quot; He is fighting against history itself, and he whofights against history is doomed to defeat.&quot;&apos;The only other topic of importance was economic weakness, which,however, declined to about two-thirds of its previous value. The main pointsstressed were the weakness of the pound sterling, the loss of Scandinaviansupplies, and the lack of shipping space due to rerouteing of shipping via the Cape.6 :Germany, 3% (3%)Britain, 3.% (4%)France, 8% (10%)Neutrals, 5% (5J%)5. French Weakness.French weakness, even more than British weakness, was monopolised by military topics. The avalanche of the German army, breaking through theMaginpt Line, had destroyed France&apos;s security with one blow. The situation of 1914 was reversed. Germany could concentrate her attack, while france was forced to mount guard on other fronts. M. Peynaud had himselfadmitted that the situation was the most dangerous that France had everfaced. Germany had frustrated the Gamelin plan and had dictated a mobilewar.
6. British Brutality and Unscrupulousness.The general theme of Allied Unscrupulousness (themes 6 to 11 inclusive) Germany, m%showed a marked rise during the period preceding the invasion of Holland Britaitli 17i% m&apos;and Belgium, and an equally marked decline subsequently. On the 1st May -. &apos; (i3i%)the general theme occupied only 5 per cent, of the total home propaganda, France,^41% (ioi%)on the 10th May 61 per cent., and on the 15th May 8 per cent. A similar 1 eu raS) (16i%)development was noticed during the periods before and after the invasion of Denmark and Norway.The theme of British Brutality increased on the average by one-quarterduring the whole fortnight. The most important sub-theme was the allegation-tion that Britain desired to extend the war at the expense of other nations.From the 3rd May to the 9th the main subject of each day&apos;s propaganda wasthe Allied plan to extend the war to the Mediterranean, or, alternatively, tocreate a state of tension in South-East Europe as a cover for a move elsewhere.At its peak this topic occupied as much as 40 per cent, of the total output.The subject was initiated by Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s speech on the 2nd May,showing that a new front was to be sought in the Mediterranean, developedby the movement of the Allied fleets to Alexandria, and crowned by the reportof the telephone conversation between Mr. Chamberlain and M. Reynaud onthe 7th May. &quot; To-day it is known all over the world that the warmongeringgovernmental cliques in London and Paris will bear before history the full responsibility for every attempt to extend the war.&quot; Not until the evening of the 8th May was it suggested on the German wireless that the British storyof a German march on Holland masked a similar threat by the Alliesthemselves.On the 10th May nearly two-thirds of the total propaganda output was occupied with the justification of the German &quot; counter-stroke &quot; in the low countries. The complicity of the Dutch and Belgian Governments (but notthe people) in the Allied plans was stressed much more than the similarcomplicity of the Norwegian Government in April, and the emphasis was maintained for a longer period.The capitulation of Holland was hailed as a further proof of Britain&apos;sunscrupulous exploitation of other countries. &quot; England gives Holland help to die, while she seizes the Dutch West Indies, and plucks cheap laurels inthe Arctic Sea by the rape of little Iceland.&apos;&apos;Injuries done to neutrals by the British blockade, which formed soprominent a feature of German propaganda in the first months of the war,were practically neglected, with the striking exception of the sufferings ofItaly.The alleged bombing of the open town of Freiburg by Allied aeroplaneswas made the occasion for a final warning that Germany would retaliatewith five planes for one. &quot; You may call it vengeance, but for Germans it is nothing but a. natural act of justice.&quot; In broadcasts to Britain the raidingaeroplanes were described as French. In broadcasts to France, on the otherhand, they were described as British &quot;English pilots have perpetratedanother slaughter of the innocents, as during the last war, when they flew over Lille, they dropped bombs on the Church of St. Saveur, where littlegirls were engaged in their first Communion.&quot;7. French Brutality and Unscrupulousness.The increase in the importance of this theme was due to the coupling Germany, 8% (5%)of France with Great Britain in charges of joint determination to extend F^cabinet&apos; 1% (5%)^the war.   The accusations made against France alone were that her defence Neutrals, 7i%&apos;0(6%)system had been deliberately constructed as complementary to that of Belgium,and that French-Dutch dictionaries had been captured In Holland.The bombing of Freiburg and the proposed &quot; murder&quot; of parachutistswere both violently denounced. The French press was quoted as demandingthat German parachutists &quot; those stinking beasts&quot; should be tortured to death. German parachutists, it was declared, fight in uniform and honestly,and for each murdered parachutist ten enemy prisoners would bite the dust.8. Britain Lies.This theme has sunk to an exceptionally low level.   Most emphasis was Germany, 3% (4%)placed on &quot;atrocity lies,&quot; such as the bombing of civilians, hospitals and Britain 4% (7%)D &apos;        r France, 31% (5%)Neutrals, 31% (5%)
lunatic asylums. These were compared with similar stories in the last war,which had been long discredited by Lord Ponsonby. Next in importancewere the usual charges that Mr. Churchill was afraid to admit the heavy losses inflicted on his navy by the German air force. It was pointed out that,while German aeroplanes could aim well enough to hit &quot;nut-shells oftrawlers,&quot; they were apparently incapable of hitting anything larger. other points refuted were the false claims of the R.A.F. raids on Germany, the bringing down of German aeroplanes, and the slander that Germanparachutists were dropped in disguise.9. France Lies.Br[t&quot;fnm%\ ^e ma*n charges were: &quot;atrocity lies&quot;; stories of disguised GermanKrmlc&quot;.&apos;3% (5%)* parachutists; exaggeration of German losses in Poland and Norway; andNeutrals, 1% misleading reports of the German advance through Belgium.10. Allied War Guilt.Bri&apos;&quot;fi&quot;yi%% i^P Hitler, in his order of the day on the 10th May, pointed out that all hisFranc&quot;,&apos;i% peace offers had been refused and that the struggle for life and death hadNe.1tr.-1 is, $% (1%) been forced on Germany. Mr. Chamberlain could have reached an under-standing with Hitler, but he preferred war to the necessary reorganisation of Europe.11.
