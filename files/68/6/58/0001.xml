PERRINSHOME OFFICE \ Secretary.8th January, 1934.5th. October 1933.Dear Sir Vvrilliam,During a number of months past I have been associated with Sir WilliamPope in an investigation into the action of dinit.ro derivatives of variousphenols for the purpose of stimulating metabolism.    The expenses involvedin this investigation have been defrayed by a grant from British ColloidsLtd., to which firm Sir William Pope is consulting chemist.It appears to be clear that there is ajgreat future for the emplov-ment of substances of this kind for therapeutic purposes, particularly inthe direction of reducing weight, but Sir William and I foresee that theindiscriminate use of these poisonous compounds is likely to lead to manyfatalities.    Would it,  therefore, not be advisable&apos;to put the dinitroderivatives of phenolic substances into the Dangerous Drug Act Scnedule inorder to ininimisc; the risk which is undoubtedly attached to their employment?   In this way it should be possible to ensure that they would only be sold against a prescription of a qualified medical praotitioner.I enclose a reprint of a recent note that Sir William and ipublished on this subject which contains references to:certain Americanpublications dealing with the clinical applications Of some members ofthis group of compounds..rI beg to remain,Yours sincerely,     ______.....E.

The calling out of personnel &quot;by rota has been brought into force in many areas with good resultso7,   The public and the wardens service have rendered great assistancein extinguishing, by stirrup pumps, and other means, numerous fires started by incendiary bombsoBehaviour of the Public.8.   The cheerfulness and good discipline of the public have been observed everywhere.     Confidence in shelters has been reinforced by thefact that people who have taken cover in them have been unharmed even whenbombs have burst within a few fee to     The immediate repair by LocalAuthorities of damage done to private houses has had an excellent effect onthe public.9*   The purchase of stirrup pumps, the formation of neighbours&apos; firepartiesi the protection of windows and the building of private shelters have all been stimulated by official encouragement and the ceurss of eventsoConditions of Service of Civil Defence Volunteers.10*   A Committee representing those Trade Unions which are oloselyconcerned with conditions in the Civil Defence Services has been set up toqfford a channel of communication between the Unions and the Government on questions affecting the basic conditions of service of civil defence personnels11*   The standard weekly rates of pay of whole-time volunteers havebeen increased from 1st July by flat rate additions of 5s for men and 3s 6dfor women.12.   Steps have been taken to maintain, and where: neoessary augment,the strengths of the police and fire services which were being depleted,particularly in industrial areas, by competition from industry.   employment as a whole-time police auxiliary has been made a reserved occupation fromthe age of 30 and the calling up of men over 27 and under 30 already servingas whole-time auxiliaries has been postponed until the 1st Ootober, except where they can be spared earliero     Similar steps have been taken to defex1the calling up of 31,500 part-time auxiliary firemen? :..  Arrangements havealso been made under which police and fire auxiliaries may be recruited from men over 30 registered under the National Service (Armed Foroes) Act,and an Order has been made prohibiting resignation from the police or fire services without permission.Air Raid Shelter.13,   In view of the development of widespread air raids, the question.of shelter in those areas which, not being classifr^d amongst the most vunerable areas, have not been provided with free domestic shelter, has been re views doLocal authorities in these areas have been instructed to dp everything possibleto assist persons eligible for the provision of free shelter, especiallyin the neighbourhood of important establishments or key points, e.g, byemploying professional consultants to.advise householders on the constructionof shelters in their homes, by acquiring and distributing stocks of suitablematerials, or by employing labour where the householders are unable to dothe work themselves.     In addition, a certain number of communal sheltersare to be provided in the more thickly populated areasoAdvice to the Public,14,   A booklet entitled &quot;Air Raids - What you must know - What you must do&quot; has been published and placed on saleo     Local authorities have beenasked to advertise it by every available means0     The booklet oontainsadvice to the general public on methods of protection against air attack.Smoke screens,15,   Arrangements have been made for all industrial works in certain areas to produce as much extra smoke as is feasible as a normal procedure-2-

On vfjM whole&quot;, the &quot;medical superintendents werein favour of the red colouring but it was suggested by threjrmedicalsuperintendents that it mightftbe confused jyllh Glycerin of jfcymol(coloured   with Bordeaux 3) pit; i-ercuric   iodide lotion (coloured withEosih).     The suggestion, however, did not meet with general support.It was the general consensus1 of opinion of the departmental -Committee which I set up- to&quot; frame the rules on the custody&quot;  and supplyof poisons and dangerous drugs in the Council&apos;s hospitals?-that the colourof those,lotions-which are in most common use in hospitals should bestandardised and for this purpose it was considered to $?p -sufficient tostandardise the colour of phenol, mercuric iodide and n^rcurxc chloridelotions, in the&apos;case -of the two last, whether in liquid;; form or in theform .of solvellae.

of (e.g.) strychnine supplied on a medical prescription.     The CHAIRMANsaid that there oXight surely to be something yn the bottle to indicate the dangerous nature of the contents.     Mr, WHITELEGGE agreed, and pointed out that account must be taken . of the risk that the bottle might come into the hands, of some person other than the purchaser - e.g. ahausemaid - who in ijhe absence of any warning on the label might eonsiderthe contents to be a% safe as aspirin and swallow them aooordingly.Dr. SYDNEY f^ITH thought it undesirable for tablets prescribed by a doctor for a patient to be labelled &quot;Poison&quot;, and he doubted whetherthe remaining words had any value.&apos;4Dr. BONE suggested that the intention of section 19 of the Aotwas to exclude from labelling requirements medioines handed out bydoctors to patients, and thak the proposals in (4) would be ultra vires.The CHAIRMAN pointed   out tha% the Rules would be made under section ?3and could hardly be regarded a:ij ultra vires, having regard to the words of that section.Mr&apos; FRANKLIN said thatsthe medieal profession always objected to patients knowing the natare offfthe drugs that were being prescribedfor them;    he thought the word &quot;Poison&quot; was objeotionable.     Mr. LINSTEADsuggested r,h* phrase   -      To be tafeen only in accordance with thephysioian&apos;s directions&quot;.     Mr- MALLINJSON pointed out that it would often be difficult to practice to label a small artiole, such as a pill-box,with a long phrase. % .&apos;&apos;&quot; &apos; % * -&apos;  ... m.   : &apos; y &apos;After some further disoussion -pr. SYDNEY SMITH moved that theChairman&apos;s proposals in (l),  (?) and (3) /should stand and that (4)(a)and (b) should be deleted.     Sir William Wdllcox seconded.      (a) and (b)were voted upon separately, &quot;Caution&quot; beingjjsubstituted for &quot;Poison&quot; in (a).The motion that (a) be deleted was carried py 10 votes to 4, and the motion that (b) be deleted was oarried men. ion.With regard to .(4)(c), Mr. NEATHERCOAT pointed out that thepharmacist could riot put the dose on the label; unless the dootor had stated it on the prescription.     The SECRETARY;said that there was no power to make the doctor put the dose on the prescription;    the Boardcould only make it an offence for the pharmacist to supply the medicine. .-when the dose was not stated on the prescription,     Mr. NEATHERCOATindicated thatlthis placing of all the burden upon the pharmacist wasin his opinion-r^uite unfair. 1In vie*;. of the deletion of .4(a) and (b);: the Board did not thinkit worth while to&apos;;lretain (a).The SECRETARY pointed out to the Board that the effect of &apos;  -their decisionras to remove all labelling requirements in the case of&quot;the barbiturates. I&apos; Dr. ROCHE LYNCH said that he&quot; was rather apprehensiveabout,,this, and thought there might fee some kind of oautionary label-The f irStKinquest&apos;&apos;in a case of veronal poisoning might produce adversecriticism of the Board.     Dr* SYDNEY SMITH saw no reason for rwgrets:
South.   Broadly speaking, it is contemplated that ordinary industrial and commercial activities would cease on evacuation being ordered, and that only those should stay who are required to maintain essential serviceseNotices containing particulars of the scheme were posted up on 22nd Junein the towns concerned,25.   In order to encourage the voluntary evacuation ofwomen, children and other persons not in employment, from these townsin advance of an emergenoy, arrangements have been made to provide them,where necessary, with their railway fares and also to pay billetingallowances to householders in other areas with whom accommodation can bearranged either privately or by the local authority.     All possible steps are being taken to stimulate this movement of voluntary evacuationo26.   Registered school children were evacuated from the London area on the six days from June 13th to June 18th.    About 102,000 children(85% of those registered) were conveyed to districts in the West of Englandand South Wales.     Registered children from Portsmouth, Gosport and southampton numbering about 7,000 were evacuated on June 27th and June 28th0About 7,000 children from the London area who had been dispersed in theKent, and East Sussex coastal belt were moved on June 23rd, along withsome 4-50 children from the new Evacuation Area of Hythe, to districts inSouth Wales and a further 2,400 children were moved on June 25th from theevacuation areas on the East and South-East coasts to districts in theMidlands and South wales     The evacuation of nearly 40,000 children fromthe evacuation areas on the North-East coast between Newcastle and Grimsbycommenced on July 7tho27.   The arrangements for evacuation of sohool children have been revised with a view to greater flexibility.     The plans now provide for evacuation of registered children in&quot; the first place, and of further numbersas occasion may require.     Arrangements have also been made for thebilleting and payment of fares of mothers with young children who make theirown arrangements for accommodation in reception areas.     A number of districtson or near the East and South East coasts which had previously been used asreceiving districts have now been excluded from the evaouation plans.Emergenoy Casualty Services.28.   A Commission composed of Mr. Colville, Mr, Rook Car ling and anofficer of the Ministry of Health has been visiting all Regions in order to review the hospital arrangements.     As a result of the Commission&apos;srecommendations a number of improvements have been made in the organisation,and in particular greatly increased responsibility has been delegated to the regional Officers of the Ministry.     These Officers are now authorised tctake any action necessary for the acceleration of the construction, equipment,and staffing of hospitals.29*   A valuable contribution is being made   to the medical and casualtyservices by the American Ambulance (Great Britain), an organisation initiated by the American Society in London under the presidency of the american ambassador. &quot;   This organisation has undertaken to provide a large fleet of vehicles, comprising oars for mobile surgical teams, ambulances for inter-hospital transport, and mobile first aid posts, ar.&quot; to be financiallyresponsible for their garaging and maintenance and the provision of driversoThese units will be based on depots in London and in eaoh of the regional headquarters towns (with three depots in Scotland)*Railways.30.   The effect of air raids on the working of the railways has beenslight and has not resulted in any serious  /disorganisation, but heavymovements of troops and stores and the evacuation of civilians have reactedadversely on general traffic.     Owing to the cessation of shipment of coal to france , railway sidings and yards have become congested with wagons ofcoal - particularly in South Wales where there are no less than 25,000
The SECRETARY pointed out however that the Home Office lsttindicated that the Secretary of State&apos;s view was that the Act was directed against fatal poisoning.     Dr. JOHNSTON said that in his opiaoetanilide was much more immediately dangerous than amidopyrine.Lir. LINSTEAD referred to a review of the subject in 1909, ian American papen in whioh 515 cases of acetanilide poisoning were described, but the SECRETARY pointed out that the Home Offioe was awaof only a fevr fatalities in this oountry, all oocurrihg before 1914.Professor STOCKHAH said that he was relying upon experienoerather than statistics, and that in his opinion only a few, drugs had this effect of poisoning but not o&amp;using death.

He, pointed out that it was for the most parlt. not used by doctors.     Mr. ISaLLINSON said that if itsale were restriot&amp;ji to pharmacists its use co%d be discouraged;   the evil to be met was the. unsuuervised sale from village &quot;corner shops&apos;.In reply to a suggestion made by the C&amp;%RMAN, the SECRETARYpointed out that under seotibn 17 of the Aot aoetaivLlide, which was usonly for humanSailments, oould%ot be plaoed in.
