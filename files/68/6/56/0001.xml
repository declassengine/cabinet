,w .332THE    COAL    POSITION. &apos; \^&apos;&quot;Report by the Secretary for- LinesNo.  20.  16th - 30th June,  194-0.NOTE,:     This report is being submitted in relation to a periodof a fortnight only so that future reports may eachrelate to a calendar1 month.The collapse of France has had far reaching repercussions onthe coal position.      Not only has the main export market beensuddenly cut off, creating a surplus of output of the order of twomillion tons a month after meeting all inland and possible exportrequirements, but the difficulties of the situation have been further aggravated for the moment by the withdrawal of a very largenumber of loaded ships from French ports.     The disposal of thiscoal at home and abroad is being organised by the Department, and,considering the difficulties of the situation, with reasonably satisfactory results.      Already 112 of these boats have been allocated to ports in the United Kingdom and Eire, and negotiations are proceeding in respect of a further 50 boats.      In addition some58 vessels have been sent overseas.      It is not possible yet to assess precisely the number of boats thus affected by tne closing of the French coal market, but of those which have been notified to the Department, the greater part has been disposed of.F r o du c t i o n: art d E mp 1 o y me n t.The loading of coal for France was stopped on the 1.6th June,but the supply of empty wagons was sufficient to keep most pitsin full operation for the week-ending 22nd June, and, as will beseen from the following table,  the production of saleable coal forthat week, though 813000 tons down on the week before, was over500,000 tons in excess of that for the corresponding week of lastyear.Estimated Quantity of Saleable Goal Raised.week-ended       Corresponding week1940. 1959.Tons.

T-2-$ tocking.Dislocation of normal trade by the return of coal from france is likely to continue for two or three weeks.     thereafter the general position is likely to be one of much surplus capacity in the exporting areas with sontinuing heavy demands in the Midlanand Lancashire.     In view of tne prooaoility of growing transport difficulties, both by sea and rail at a later date, every effort igbeing made to maintain production for the present by encouragingstocking by all classes of consumers, as well as by merchants and tcollieries &quot;themselves.      The response of the householders ihparticular to the recent broadcast invitation to stock has been sogood as to be almost embarrassing.     The pace of the whole movement!is being set by transport facilities and with the continual increasein the stocks of public utility companies it has not been possibleyet to spare much coal for Government dumps.     Nevertheless, theprogramme of Government stocks is being greatly extended, both inlocality and amount, against the time when surplus coal is availablin quantity.The aggregate reserves of the public utility companies nowrepresent roughly 7 weeks&apos;  winter consumption in the case of gas,the corresponding figures for electricity and water being 6^ weeks55and 13-4 v/eeks.     For the main line railways the position is far lea]satisfactory, the average stock being at present only 4 weeksconsumption.Exports.With the closing of the French market close consideration being given to the possibility of expanding the export trade inother markets, notably. South America, Portugal and Canada.Coal shipment figures at the present time are misleadingowing to the diversion to other destinations of ships carrying coal to France and returned to this country.     Accordingly the usualexport returns are omitted from this report.x   Exclusive of the special stock of 184,000 tons atDagenham, which is being replenished.
