There were improved deliveries of empty shells during April for 18-pdr., 25-pdr.,3-7-inch A.A. shrap., 40-mm. and 2-pdr. T. and A.T.2. Filling of 25-pdr. was curtailed owing to the shortage of special sizes of cordite resultingfrom the eai-lier explosion at Waltham Abbey.3. During the month filling of 2-pdr. A.T. was transferred to Chorley with a temporary lossof output.4. The filling of 112,000 of 40-mm. A.A. compares with an average of 12,500 rounds per month since December 1939.Artillery Equipment.5.   There is an improvement in the delivery of 2-inch Mortar Sights.Anti-Aircraft.,6. The number of 4-5-inch predictors accepted in March was abnormally high, and thetotal for March and April of this type was in accordance with the rated output of the manufacturers.[21316] B 2
&apos; &apos; &apos;     S.A. A m munition.7. Deliveries of S.A.A.&apos; from abroad included 21 million rounds of -303-inch Mk.-VII. from india compared with 10 million in March and 11-5 million in February.Explosives. .... -.ft. The production of Cordite at Walthani Abbey reached 70 per cent, capacity for thefirst three weeks of the period,-but the explosion on the 20th April caused a further set-back.Production at 50 per cent, capacity will probably recommence towards the. end of May.9. T.N.T. home production is down owing to an explosion at: Irvine R-.&apos;0.F.. 185 tons from canada are included in the April figure. .  ,,- ...&apos;j     &apos; &apos;f: &apos; Tanks.    .....,      -      i-^:    - &apos; .10. Figures are now being compiled on a weekly basis. The April figures cover 4 weeks tothe 27th, and are therefore not strictly comparable with those for March. Deliveries of sparetracks, which have been, a serious problem, are now improving; four new firms came into production in April.11. The existing contracts of&apos;-3-of the. 5 Light, Tank erectors are. almost completed, anddeliveries of the new Mark VII have not yet started.12. Production of Cruiser Tanks was delayed by difficulty in deHveries&apos;-&apos;of components, butlarge deliveries were made in the last two days of the month, which ar&apos;e&apos;not included in thepresent figures.13. The deliveries of Infantry Tanks have not increased as anticipated owing tomodifications to the suspensions on A. 12 tanks.Wheeled Vehicles.14. Raw material difficulties became, acute during April, and are the. mam reason for thedecline in certain deliveries, in particular 30-cwt.&apos; 6-wh&apos;eeled Lorries. The Vehicle Repair schemeis in full operation with over 1,100 vehicles under repair.15. Figures for 3-ton 6-wheeled Lorries include chassis awaiting fitment of bodies.Corrected figures for February and March are shown.Engineer Stores.1G. Deliveries were generally below forecast, chiefly owing to the extreme difficulty in getting adequate supplies of steel and other raw material. Loss of skilled or semi-skilled labour to the Services also caused dislocation in some cases.       &apos;  -   - 117. The drop in deliveries of Projectors and Sound Locators arose from insufficiency ofTrailers.18. The fall in the deliveries of Reconnaissance boats was due to insufficient supplies ofcanvas resulting from shortage of raw material and loom operatives.19. Deliveries of Bridges 12-ft. No. 1, Mk. 1, fell owing to shortage of special steel for deckplates.   The position is now improving..Signal Stores. . . ; v. ;-lc   .20.   Completion of Charging Sets 550 watt was delayed by failure ifr switchboard deliveries.21. The fall in deliveries of Switchboard TJ.C. 6 and 10 lhie : was : due to hold-up in rawmaterials. &apos;22. Unsatisfactory deliveries of Quad Cable have been due to difficulties experienced b5: newfirms brought into production, resulting, in one case in particular, in a high percentage ofrejections.23. The fall in the April production of D. Class Cable reflects the transport difficulties and sickness epidemics earlier in the year, and manufacturers are still having difficulty with rawmaterials, particularly cotton, -rubber and steel wire.24. The fall in output of R.D.F. sets was due to shortage of gears for cabins, resulting fromemergency diversion of turntables to the Air Ministry and Admiralty.Anti-Gas Stores.25. The acute shortage of cotton yarn has affected supplies of canvas for haversackproduction. An alternative material of shorter life is being used temporarily in place of standardcanvas.26. The decreased production of Ointment (2-oz. Sets) during April was due to the necessityof stopping production of pots for about 4 weeks to recondition the glass furnaces. Manufactureof pots has now been resumed on full scale. ...Clothing and Equipment Stores.27. A large demand for saddlery has been received from the Roumanian Government, tomeet which it is hoped to use some of the small firms. The considerable demands received for supplies for Norway were for the. most part met within a period of about a fortnight.28.   Deliveries of greatcoats are substantially above requirements.29. The required further increase in deliveries of overalls will be limited by present shortsupplies of denim drab;  action to increase has been taken.   See under Cotton in Section IV.30. The rate of production of web equipment generally increased slightly during April, but was limited (in common with overalls) by the difficulty in obtaining the release of cotton yarn.31.   Deliveries of mess tins were unsatisfactory, and action to increase has been taken.32.   Deliveries of blankets and steel helmets are in excess of requirements. &quot;

Raw Materials.The loss of Scandinavian supplies is the most important event of the month.Substitutes for these supplies are obtainable, but from more distant sources and often at greater cost. The Swedish ore can be replaced by North African ore, theSwedish steels by United States steels, and the Swedish and Finnish timber byCanadian timber. The Norwegian aluminium is a serious loss and further efforts are being made to increase Canadian supplies. The most bulky supplies thatwill be lost are the Scandinavian wood pulp and paper. These cannot be entirelyreplaced even from Canada, and the United States and a severe restriction of theuse of paper is necessary.The resultant effect of events in Scandinavia on supplies of raw materialscannot be judged until it is known whether it results in more ships becoming available for us.The importation of raw materials has started to improve in recent weeks;larger supplies of iron-ore have come in and many boats are being loaded inCanada with timber.Iron and Steel.The improvement in the output of home ore in March has been sustained;transport has worked smoothly and stocks have been increased. The occupationof Narvik by Germany cut off the supplies of Swedish ore, but immediate arrange-ments were made to draw additional supplies of high grade ore from theMediterranean and Sierra. Leone. Imports of Swedish charcoal pig iron havealso ceased, but there are good stocks in this country and West Coast hematiteis a possible substitute.The new scheme for the distribution of steel supplies came into operation onthe 1st April. There have been minor initial difficulties, but generally it hasmade a good start.   During April schemes were approved for extending the
production of alloy steels at four works, giving an additional output of 55,000tons a year of alloy steels from electric furnaces and 17,000 tons a year of alloysteels from open hearth furnaces.In order to meet the urgent need for alloy steels in the interval, as well as tomake up for the cutting off of Swedish supplies, some 55,000 tons of alloy steelare being purchased in the United States.Ferro Alloys.As a result of the German invasion of Norway and the consequent positionof Sweden, steps have been taken to obtain additional supplies of ferro silicon,silico spiegel, silico manganese and refined ferro manganese from Canada.Ferrochrome, so far as it is unobtainable from United Kingdom sources, will be purchased in France, Yugoslavia and the United States.Copper, Lead and Zinc.Consumption of these metals continues at a high level despite restriction ofcivil uses. The French have suffered a serious loss in their high grade zincsupplies by-the invasion of Norway. Proposals are being considered for expansionof production in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom.An Inter-Services Committee, consisting of representatives of the Ministryof Supply, the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, has now been appointed toco-operate with the Deputy Controller for Brass.Nickel.About one-fifth of the nickel consumed in this country has hitherto comefrom the refinery of the Falconbridge Nickel Company of Canada at Kristiansand,Norway. Arrangements have been made under which the International NickelCompany will assist the Falconbridge Company by refining a part of its mineoutput in Canada.  Supplies of nickel to this country will not be affected.-*A luminium.With one exception the aluminium works in Norway are in German occupied territory. Consequently, we cannot count on obtaining the 14,000 tons of metalwhich it was estimated would be obtained from this source. Enquiries are being-made of Canadian producers who may be able to accelerate production and alsoextend capacity. A meeting with the French revealed that French requirementsof metal for this year were now in excess of their original estimate. It is expectedthat it will be possible to assist them from Canada or Switzerland.Cryolite, which is used as a flux in aluminium production, is mined inGreenland and has hitherto been refined in Denmark before sale to this country.Substantial stocks are held at present and future supplies should be obtainablefrom Canada, where capacity for additional refining exists. Arrangements arebeing made with the Canadian Government to work the Greenland deposits.Tin.Stocks of tin metal and tin ore at the chief English smelters on the 31st Marchamounted to about four months&apos; consumption, showing an improvement on theposition earlier in the year.Pyrites, Sulphur and Sulphuric Acid.Pyrites and acid sulphur are being shipped regularly. The effect of the longer sea haul and consequent higher freights on sulphur is that sulphur hasincreased in price to a greater extent than pyrites. The pre-war price differentialis, however, being maintained in the Ministry&apos;s issue prices to the consumer.Inorganic Fertilisers.Deliveries continue to be satisfactory, though it has been necessary to askfor priority as regards railway trucks till the 15th May. This, with the supportof the Ministry of Agriculture, has been granted.Estimates of production for 1940-41 and 1941-42 have been prepared for theMinistry of Agriculture.
Bichromates of Soda and Potash and their Derivatives.The allocation schemes for the main consuming industries were successfullybrought into operation, with effect from the 1st April, after discussion by theinter-departmental committee on bichromates. This committee has appointed a technical sub-committee under the chairmanship of the Government Chemist toconsider the specifications of paints calling for the use of chrome colours.Molasses and Industrial A Icohol.An Order has been issued, with effect from the 8th April, whereby certain increases in the maximum prices of molasses are permitted. These increases arenecessitated bv further increases in replacement values, although stocks which are held have enabled lower prices to be fixed than would otherwise be possible.Corresponding increases in the maximum prices of alcohol and derived solventsare permitted by the Order.Bromine.Arrangements are being made for the purchase by the Ministry of Supply ofthe requirements of the Ministry and of the Air Ministry for the manufacture ofa bromide for fire extinguisher purposes. The purchase is from the PalestinePotash Company, who will add to their plant in Palestine to meet this demand.Chrome Ore and Magnesite.Proposals made by the Air Ministry for the expansion of the plants makingsynthetic magnesia in this country are under consideration.Diatornaceous Earth.The question of replacing Danish supplies by supplies from Northern ireland is being explored.A brasives.Arrangements are being made for the replacement from France and Canadaof Scandinavian supplies of silicon carbide. It is hoped that, by the use of available washing and grading capacity in the United Kingdom, it will be possibleto take semi-manufactured and cheaper grades of silicon carbide from Canada.Timber.The Softwood position remains serious and imports during the first four months of the year have averaged only some 42,500 standards per month againstmonthly requirements of 104,000 standards. Though some improvement is hoped for in future, it is likely that by the end of June stocks will have fallen belowthe safety level of 250,000 standards. The position has been aggravated by theloss of 100,000 standards purchased in Scandinavia, while there also seems apossibility that a potential source of supply may be lost, i.e., some 6,000 standardsper month from Yugoslavia and Roumania. All possible steps are being takento secure economy and to facilitate production of home-grown timber. To assist in home production the Forestry Commissioners have recently been given powerto order the felling of growing trees, to requisition timber which they have felledor caused to be felled, and to take possession of any land for the purpose of fellingoperations.Supplies of pitwood from France in recent months have been adequate, but unless the French can obtain additional labour it is feared that production duringthe summer will fall considerably.Negotiations are now in progress in Portugal for a coal-pitwood agreement,and it is hoped that, as a result, an increased quantity of Portuguese shippingwill be available for the conveyance of mining timber to the United Kingdom.    &amp;Silk.Further discussions have taken place with the French Textile Mission andthe French Silk &quot; Groupement.&quot;;;. It was agreed that joint purchase of raw silk for France and the UnitedKingdom was unnecessary in view of ample supplies, but that there should be an exchange of information on the probable volume and time of future purchasesThe joint purchase of waste silk is being further examined.
Rayon.- Rayon yarn producers reverted as from the beginning of April to their pre-war practice of quoting firm prices for the month of order and three subsequentmonths.Increased purchases of wood pulp from the United States and Canada, inview of curtailment of supplies from Scandinavia, are under discussion.Hemp.The supply position of manila, sisal and Indian hemp continues to be satis-factory, both as regards quantities and prices, but difficulties continue to be experienced in regard to true hemp. It is hoped, however, that the position will improve as a result of negotiations with Hungary and Yugoslavia, New pricelists have been issued by the Hemp Control in respect of Indian and true hemps.An agreement for the supply of 5,000 tons of Italian hemp has been concluded,but this will be used mainly as a substitute for flax.Paper.A serious shortage of paper is expected as a result of the stoppage of suppliesof wood pulp and paper from Norway and the Baltic. An Order has been madegreatly restricting production and delivery of paper and bringing them understricter control. The Treasury have sanctioned the purchase of such quantities ofwood pulp as can be obtained in Canada and the United States, but this will not meet all important requirements. An arrangement has been made with newspaper proprietors to permit them to import 325,000 tons of newsprint from America on certain conditions, including the cutting of the size of the penny daily papers toeight pages. Two sub-committees of the Joint Production and Materials PrioritySub-Committees are examining Stationery Office and non-Stationery Officerequirements of paper to secure drastic economies.The paper position in France is also serious, and arrangements for thepurchase of paper making materials in America by the Paper Control for jointaccount are being pursued. &quot;Steps are being taken to increase the collection of waste paper and to enforceeconomy in the use of paper by the general public.Hides, Skins and Tanning Materials.Imports of all materials were adequate in March, and the supply positionis reasonably satisfactory.Wool.Arrangements have been made to acquire the exportable surplus of wooledsheepskins from the Falkland Islands, and some 10,000 bales of such skins from south Africa. The Falkland Islands skins are relatively few, but the wool isof a kind in short supply needed for Service clothing. The South African woolhas special characteristics, and will be used to supplement the supplies obtainedfrom the skins which it is hoped to acquire from Australia and New Zealand.fibber.Stocks have remained steady at the lower level which was reached towardsthe end of February. Shipments in March and April have been heavy.The closing of the Mediterranean to British ships will, however, lengthen the voyage, and thereby delay the process of replenishing stocks. The rate of consumption has increased substantially since the outbreak of war.Cement.Sanction has been given by the Ministry to a further immediate advanceof 3s. 6d. per ton in the price of cement, owing to increased production and delivery costs. The books of the cement manufacturers are at present underinvestigation by the Accountant-General and further modifications may benecessary when his report is received.L21316] c
Cotton.Stocks of raw cotton are still abundant, and it will be possible to cut downimports of cotton during the second year of the war. It is proposed to instituteimport licensing shortly.There has been congestion of orders on spinners&apos; books, and in order tofacilitate further production and delivery of yarn for Government requirements and export orders, the acceptance of new yarn contracts for ordinary homerequirements was prohibited for one month from the 17th April. Provision wasmade for special permits for essential home requirements.As a further step, the Cotton Controller is being authorised to give directions to the spinners, should this be found necessary, for delivery of specifiedamounts of cotton yarn required for Government contracts.Salvage.Military Side.Reception Depots. Work on the Reception Depots is proceeding, though there has been delay in the railway&apos;s work&quot; on the sidings. Completion of bothDepots is expected in August.France. Disposals of Army Salvage from the B.E.F. are proceeding and sales have been effected of at least one large dump of used petrol tins.Civilian Side.Local Authority Schemes. &quot; Positive &quot; Returns for March were receivedfrom 650 Councils (against 324 in November), representing a population of about35 millions. The sales were  75.000 against  29,000 in November. Additionalschemes were started in April.Special attention has been given to waste paper. Most large users of cartonshave agreed to print on them a request to save them when empty for salvage.The Trade Associations have also given special consideration to methods ofincreasing the salvage and economy of paper and board.Publicity. This has been continued by further broadcasts, local conferences,and press notices. Some large firms have offered free advertising space in thepress.Industrial Salvage. Enquiries have continued in regard to a number ofspecial materials and in many cases outlets have been found.Inter-Departmental Co-operation. Co-operation has continued with theiMinistries of Food and Agriculture and with the Services.V. Priority.Production and Materials (Joint) Priority Sub-Committees.Ra/\u Materials.Four meetings were held and the supply and demand position of the followingraw materials was discussed :  (a) Steel.(b) Cotton.(c) Paper and Paper Board.Many of the matters discussed and the conclusions arrived at are dealt within Part TV (Raw Materials) of the report. Points not thus dealt with are setout below.Standardisation.It was agreed that liaison between the British Standards Institution and theProduction and Materials Priority Sub-Committees should be maintained throughthe Central Priority Department, and that the B.S.I. should be invited to attend meetings as occasion arose.
Use of the Power of Requisition under Regulations 53 and 55 of the Defence-Regulations, 1939.The Ministerial Priority Committee has called upon Departments not to use the powers of requisitioning given by Defence Regulations 53 and 55 without reference to the Priority Sub-Committee concerned except in the following casesset out in paragraph 3 of paper No. C.P.D. (P. &amp; M.) 138 : (a) Inland Transport Service.(b) Requisitioning of raw materials or food (including feeding-stuffs).(c) Requisitioning of ships or aircraft.(d) Requisitioning of agricultural land.(e) Temporary requisitioning for immediate urgencjr.Medical Stipplies.(a) It was agreed that planning for the supply of surgical dressings for all government Departments and Allied and Foreign Governments shouldbe undertaken by the Ministry of Supply, which should also advise on the control of imports;(b) and that the Ministry of Supply (Directorate of Clothing and Textiles)should make arrangements to set up an interdepartmental committeeto advise on the co-ordination of purchasing and on the standardisation of medical dressings, consisting of members of the Departmentsprincipally concerned with power to co-opt representatives of otherDepartments as necessary.Paper and Paper Board.It was agreed that Sub-Committees should be set up to examine the speci-fications and requirements and to report on the economies which can be effectedas regards : (i) Supplies by the Stationery Office for H.M. Services,(ii) Supplies other than by the Stationery Office.Breakdown Sheets.A large number of organisations have agreed to complete breakdown sheetsin respect of their products and have submitted suggestions for the amendmentof entries in the draft Product Code Book. Completed breakdown sheets havealready been received in the Department.Index of Firms in Certain Industries.Some 20,000 forms have been received from the Ministry of Labour and national Service containing most of the information required to complete an index of firms for the Engineering, Shipbuilding, Motor Car and aircraft industries.VI. Area Organization.During April the establishment of the Area Organization, as originallyenvisaged, was completed. Representatives of the twelve Area Boards have been nominated by the Admiralty, Air Ministry, Ministry of Supply and Ministry ofLabour and National Service, and the Secretaries have taken up their duties.The Employer and Trades Union members of the twenty-three AdvisoryCommittees have been appointed and the necessary arrangements have been madefor Headquarters administration in the Ministry of Supply. The Board of Tradeis proceeding at once to make the necessary appointments of their representatives on the Area Boards who will watch the interests of the export trade. A repre-sentative of the Northern Ireland Ministry.of Commerce has already joined theNorthern Ireland Board.In general, it may be said that the Boards and Committees are settling downto their task very well. The Ministry of Supply has sought the aid of theCommittees in finding capacity for certain requirements of which there is atpresent a shortage. The results of this have not so far been as satisfactory as[21316]   &apos; D
had been hoped. In order to encourage the Committees the Ministry has now-arranged that definite requirements of certain simple stores shall be allocated to Areas. The Advisory Committees are being notified of these requirements andhave been asked to find firms who can undertake definite contracts. So far require-ments of base plates, bombs, primers and shell bodies have been notified to fiveAreas. The Admiralty and Air Ministry have also been asked to find require-ments on which the Advisory Committee can be asked to advise.VII. Labour.Difficulties regarding skilled labour became more evident during the month by the increase in&apos; the extent of unregulated bidding for available labour. Theshortage is now having a serious effect upon both construction and production programmes, and unless prompt action is taken which will ensure more efficient use of the available man-power, the rate of armament production will fall short of that required by the present programme.Construction.There is a shortage of bricklayers in Lancashire and in both North andSouth Wales. An endeavour is being made to overcome this difficulty by the extended use of concrete, but nevertheless construction is being delayed.Negotiations are in progress with the Liverpool A.R.P. Authorities for the releaseof bricklayers for factory construction, but the men prefer to work near their homes rather than to travel considerable distances to factories under construction,and the Liverpool authorities are thereby able to retain them, and indeed to attract them from the factories, without offering exceptional rates of pay. no reply has yet been received to the request that such bricklayers should be released.Very few bricklayers appear to have transferred to these areas from London,where there is some surplus.  There is no shortage in other constructional trades,Production.Many machine tools are idle for many hours per day and in certain cases insome areas, owing to lack of sufficient skilled labour, are only being worked forone shift. The demand of the Ministry of Supply programme for labour in theengineering industries is under investigation but is expected to lie between400.000 and 500.000 additional hands by the end of the year. Of these asubstantial proportion will be required for skilled work.Training.An investigation in conjunction with the Ministry of Labour and the Boardof Education has been made into the question of the rapid expansion of the useof existing training centres for the supply of skilled labour to the armament industry. Arrangements have been made for the Technical Inspectors of theBoard of Education to work in close co-operation with the Area Boards to obtainthe most efficient use of these centres.Relaxation of Custom A greement.Agreement with the Labour representatives has been reached in the caseof the Ordnance Factory at Radway Green to the employment of Ministry ofLabour trainees on skilled work under the Relaxation of Custom Agreement.The numbers concerned are small and the recruiting of skilled labour to theRoyal Ordnance Factories through this Agreement has been very disappointing.Arrangements are being made in the case of the shell factory at Cardonald, the filling factory at Swynnerton and the gun factory at Leeds to start work withwomen for jobs previously done elsewhere by men.Exemption and Release from Military Service.The difficulties referred to in the Report for March 1940 in connexion withthe exemption of certain classes of Government employees are still underconsideration.The military authorities have intimated that they are unable to agree tothe release in any cases of army reservists or of men above the rank of lance-corporal, and these restrictions have been accepted by the Ministry for the present.
The effect has been to reduce the number of possible releases to the machine toolindustry by some 300 out of a total of 944 for whom release was requested. Bythe end of April 44 men had been released to the industry. (The latest figureavailable is 228.)The military authorities were recently asked for the release of 309 skilled men to the home-grown timber industry. By the end of April no releases hadbeen granted. (The military authorities have since intimated that they are unwilling to release any of these men.)Ministry of Labour Census.The result of the enquiry conducted in April by the Ministry of Labourinto the number of workpeople employed in the engineering, motor vehicle,aircraft, shipbuilding and ship-repairing industries was circulated (paper.P. (G.) (40) 118)&apos; on the 30th April. This showed that the number of work people employed by the firms in this group of industries increased betweenJune 1939 and April 1940 from 1.121,463 to 1.250,708, namely, by only 129,245.(The comments of the Ministry of Supply on paper W.P. (G.) (40) 118 werecirculated in paper W.P. (G.) (40) 126 on the 9th May.)(Initialled.) H. M.The Adelyhi, W.C. 2,May 23, 1940.
