MINISTRY   OF   FOODREPORT FOR MAY ,1940SUPPLY, CONSUMPTION, STOCKS AND prices the Ministry of Food&apos;s import programme (20,022 thousand tons) for therst year of war (September-August 1939/40) is being fully implemented as a whole,the deficits of certain commodities being more than offset by surpluses of others.Whereas the programme calls for imports equal to 8&apos;Za3$ of the five-year(September-August 1934/5-1938/39) average, actual imports during September-May1959/40 equalled 89.7$ of the five-year pre-war average for -these months.     TheMinistry&apos;s policy of giving human foods priority and treating animal feeds as aresidual is reflected in the following figures which express September-May 1959/40imports as a percentage of the five-year pre-war average;Wheat105$yfaeat meal and flour 127$Meat 109$Bacon       -. 95/butter 85$Cheese 107$Tea&quot; &apos; 89$Sugar -&apos;&apos; 77$Oilseeds 105$Vegetable Oils 104$Eggs in shell 106$Maize 61$Barley 62$Oilseed cake 76$and mealThe sugar position is being improved; it has suffered up to the present from the conflict between financial and shipping considerations emphasized in last month1 sreport under the heading of animal feeding-stuffs.The diversion to the United Kingdom of cargoes consigned to the Continent,together with some increase in recent and current loadings made possible by theimprovement in the supply of shipping space, will probably be reflected in June-August arrivals in excess of the Ministry&apos;s prqgramme for these months.   A furtherconsiderable increase in imports, which owing to the present and prospectivemilitary situation would be advantageous, could be achieved by the diversion where practicable of shipping from /long to short hauls.It has been agreed that, as long as the ships are available and the ports are able to handle the stuff, the larger the volume of non-perishable essentialhuman foods and animal feeds that can be loaded in the next two or three months the better, subject, of course, to war materials being given first priority, human foodssecond priority and, the imports of animal feeds limited to the residual amount ofshipping space and port handling facilities available.     It is desired to emphasise the importance of taking every&apos; possible step to increase the stocks of food held in reserve in this country.        -  . .      ......1.     GENERAL NOTE ON SUPPLY POSITION...The supply position of the.principal foods and animal feeds is shown intabular and graphic form in the appendix.25       &quot; :Stocks of most commodities were maintained or increased during May.     the repercussions&apos; of the invasion of Denmark; and Holland are reflected in lower butter and bacon stocks, but the decline has been partially offset by decreases in the rations from 8 ozs. to 4 ozs. which took effect early in June.     The reduction inthe sugar ration from 12 ozs. to 8 ozs. on 27th May should result in a relativelystable stock position..Increased imports in June (and also in July if port facilities are not seriously curtailed) should produce a further increase in-the stocks of many, important commodities.     A considerable part of the June increase is due to the diversion tothis country of cargoes intended for Belgium, Denmark,&apos;the Netherlands and Norway.Over 450,000 tons of diverted foods and animal feeds (largely cereals and oilseeds)have already been taken over by the Ministry of Food and a further 47,000 tonsremain to be dealt with.In the forecasts there given for June&apos;,&apos;July&quot; and August no allowance   has beenmade for possible losses at sea.     As shipping tonnage has not yet been arranged for a large part of August, the predictions for that month must be regarded asless reliable than those for June and July.
The losses attributable to the entry of Italy into the war are unlikely to be serious.     The loss of oil from Egyptian cottonseed oanbe made good either from other sources or by the utilisation of alternativeoilseeds but the loss of cotton cake will be difficult to replace.   UnitedStates dried fruits may be substituted for. the lost Greek and Turkishsupplies.2.     WHEAT AND FLOUR(in terms of wheat)Total U.K. stocks on 1st June 2,122,000 tons estimated weekly total consumption (June) -     130,000   &quot;Estimated weekly consumption as flour (June) 122,500   &quot;The War Cabinet1s instruction to build up a 13 weeks&apos; reserve ofwheat has now been executed (including flour reserves as wheat).At the end of May there was a reserve of 13.2 weeks&apos; requirements,and it is anticipated that this will rise to 15.6 weeks, at the end of June.A special effort is being made to increase the proportion of flourin these reserves.   More flour is being imported, and U.K. millers are working overtime.At the end of May, reserve, working and other stocks of flour(including an estimate of 2 weeks&apos; supply in the hands of bakers, wholesalersand retailers) were equal to 6.7 weeks&apos; requirements j by July 1st this shouldrise to nearly 8 weeks&apos; supply.     A large part of this increase will beaccumulated in the eastern half of the country, but in districts which are less vulnerable than the ports.-The wheat and flour position is not materially affected by Italy&apos;sentry into the war.     June arrivals will be in excess of programme, and ifthe home crop (from which normal yields are expected) is safely harvested, theposition at the end of September should be satisfactory.3* &apos;  ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFFSMaizeTotal U.K. stocks on 1st June 125Estimated weekly consumption (June) 54.0Imports of cereal feeds continue to be below the programme for thefirst year of war in spite of the diversion to this country of shipmentsoriginally destined for the Continent.     Diverted cargoes accounted for morethan a quarter of the total of arrivals in May which, at 92$ of programme,was the highest reached this year.     Arrivals in June, July and August,including diversions, are expected to be about 80/S of programme.   None of the650,000 tons of maize purchased from the U.S.A. for June-October shipment has yet been loaded, but, unless freight for feed cereals is cancelled, 250,000tonsmay arrive before the end of August..   It is of great importance that thefull 650,000 tons should be imported.About 12,000 tons of barley have been requisitioned from Scottishdistillers&apos; stocks, but of this 2,000 tons are likely to be left in stocktemporarily.     Of the remainder slightly more than half has been allocated for human consumption, the rest for animal feed.The loss of cottonseed supplies from Egypt and the Sudan, following the entry of Italy into the war, will be probably largely offset, as regardsoil, by imports of groundnuts from India and the West Coast of Africa.     As,however, groundnuts contain 2-g- times as much oil as cottonseeds, the quantityneeded to maintain oil supplies will be substantially less and the supply ofoilcake correspondingly reduced.     This may adversely affect the long-termoilcake position, but it is hoped that cargoes originally consigned to theContinent and now diverted to the U.K. , together with increased purchases from Brazil, will offset  the immediate loss of oilcake from Mediterraneancottonseed.Barley     Oilcake&apos;000 tons246 9425.5        18.5

If the eastern mills are not available, it is estimated thatwestern manufacturers-of compounds and cereal products can produce up to 66$ ofthe pre-war requirements of the whole country; emergency arrangements on theselines, including distribution from western ports, are under consideration.4-.

Onthe other hand it must be assumed that 53 thousand tons of cottonseed expected in July and August will not be shipped from Egypt e.nd the Sudan.     As comparedwith actual stocks- of. 212 and 268 thousand tons at the end of April and Mayrespectively, the forecast for end-August stocks is 270 thousand tons.   Twentyto twenty-five thousand tons of vegetable oils, originally consigned to scandinavia and Holland, have also been diverted to this country,To provide for an expansion of the Margarine stock,- an increase of whichhas been made possible by the relaxation of restrictions on the use ofpreservatives&apos;,&apos; reductions will be made in the allocations of oil in June forcompound lard,, calces and biscuits, confectionery and other edible usessStocks of whale oil are less than those forecast in the &quot;last reportbecause, owing to insufficient storage accommodation away.fran the ports, somesupplies are being held in ports abroad for shipment to this country at a later date.     Until additional hardening plant, now being erected, is completedinsufficient quantities of hardened whale oil will&apos;be available to meet requirements,and in its distribution priority will be given to manufacturers of edible products.5-   margarine and lardIt is planned to increase the stocks held by margarine manufacturers by18,400 tons, the greater part of which will contain preservatives.   These stockswill be built up over the,next three months, and total stocks-, apart fromretailers&apos; , will then be equal to about 4 weeks&apos; consumption at the present rate.Prom the beginning of July margarine and all edible fats will be rationedto trade users.     The production of compound- lard is being reduced, but the rationing scheme will ensure that supplies are available for domestic use.   Whilstgeneral rationing is not contemplated at the moment, the necessary distributiveorganisation will shortly be completed and rationing of householders could bebrought into operation at short noticecStocks of animal lard held by the Ministry totalled nearly 8,000 tons on1st June.       A further 10,000 tons are being purchased in the U.S.A,6.   . MEAT . -  , . ,   . r     - .-       ; .

9.000 tons per week could be taken, of which 3,500 tons would be for theFrench.     The attitude of the Argentine Government to this proposed reduction is not yet known, but meat is being shipped to the U.K. from Argentina at anaverage weekly rate of about 5,600 tons.Current shipments to France from Argentina and other foreigncountries amounting to about 4,500 tons a week will presumably be diverted tothe U.K. and increase stocks substantially above the forecasts for the end ofJune and July given in the appendix.     The anticipated total arrivals,excluding diversions of shipments consigned to France, of frozen meat in thiscountry in the three months June to August are slightly below the import programme.Negotiations are being opened at once with the representatives of thethree South American countries concerned with the object of modifying thearrangements for the supply of meat on French account as soon as possible.The consumption of home-produced and imported meat (exclusive ofoffal) by the principal classes of consumers in May was as follows:1 000 tons11.811.08.0109.4140.2Civilian consumption in May was only about 80$ of the amountallowed on the ration.No corned beef is being released for civilian consumption.   Allstocks are reserved for the Services and to meet emergencies consequent on air-raids.     A new purchase of 36,000 tons of corned beef from South america is expected to arrive in this country in July and August, but apart fron apossible additional 10,000 tons from the Argentine, no further supplies willbe available until the autumn.     Bulk stocks of corned beef on 1st June wereequivalent to about 40 weeks&apos; normal consumption of that commodity, but to less than 2 weeks&apos; civilian requirements of butchers meat (home-produced and imported) at the May rate of consumption.7.     BACON AND HAMTonsTotal G.B. stocks on 1st June 37,700Estimated G.B.weekly consumption (June)        7,625It is not yet possible to estimate accurately the effect on consumption and future stocks of the reduction, on June 10th, of the civilian ration from 8 oz3. to 4 ozs. per head per week.   No immediatedecline in home production is expected, and anticipated arrivals are such that at the end of August bulk stocks will probably be somewhat above, thelevel regarded as a safe minimum.8.     SUGAR (AND GLUCOSE) , Tons.Total U*K. stocks of sugar on 1st June        414,000Estimated weekly consumption of sugar (June) 35,000Following a reconsideration of the supply position, authority hasbeen given for the purchase of an additional 500,000 tons of sugar (200,000from British India, 150,000 from Java, 100,000 from Cuba and 50,000 tons from cargoes originally consigned to the Continent).   approximately two-fifths of this amount has been bought up to the present.     Arrivals of125,000 tons of these additional purchases are expected before the end ofAugust.The ServicesManufac turersCaterersCivilians (a^ or. ration 101.6(b) pork 7.8
SO iMaking no allowance for emergency demands but having regard toadditionsl demands for sugar for fruit preservation and condensed milk, no markeddecline in stocks is now anticipated during August and September.Efforts are being made to disperse stocks as widely as possible and atthe end of June it is estimated that about 165,000 tons will be in emergencystores, distributing depots and in the hands of wholesalers, manufacturers and retailers, as compared with approximately 100,000 tons during the past few months.End-June stocks in these positions are equal to nearly 5 weeks&apos; consumption at therate now anticipated for July and August.     In addition there are about l\ weeks&apos;supply in refineries and factories, a substantial part of which is required as aminimum working stock.Rationing of glucose came into force on 5rd June.     The percentageallowed to the various manufacturing users follows sugar rationing as closely aspossible.9.     MILKSales of milk for liquid consumption in the United Kingdom during Maywere 74 million gallons as compared with 76 million gallons in May 1959 (a decreaseof 2.8$ in England and Wales being partially offset by an increase of 3.6$ inScotland).     Approximately half of this small reduction is due to lowerconsumption under the milk-in-schools scheme.    (England and Wales showing a dropof 32$ and Scotland a drop of 25$).On July 1st the price of liquid milk will be increased by 4dc a gallonover the prices ruling in July 1939.    At the same time a cheap milk scheme will come into operation, under which 1 pint per day per head at a price of 2d,(approximately half-price in the larger towns) or free of charge in the case of families   with incomes below certain levels, will be available for expectant and nursing mothers and children under 5.The quantity of milk used for Manufacturing purposes in May was 5 million gallons less than in May 1939.     The principal reductions were in the quantitiesutilised for butter and cream.     Increased supplies were used for cheese andcondensed milk, products which are being given priority in the utilisation programme.Plans have been prepared for ensuring the supply and distribution of milkin an emergency.     Much of the responsibility will fall on the Regional Officersof the Milk Marketing Board who have been given a wide measure of discretion indealing with day to day difficulties.     The Board&apos;s officials will act inco-operation with Local Pood Officers and distributors in facilitating deliveries from farms to consumers;10.     CONDENSED MILKAn Order has been made restricting to 50$ of their intake in 1958 the sales of bulk condensed milk to trade users (except in the cases of invalid andbaby foods and bread). . By a voluntary arrangement made at the instigation of theMinistry, distributors have limited their sales of canned condensed milk to 50$of 1938 figures and this arrangement will be continued throughout June and July inorder to build up stocks, which are at present equal to not more than about onemonths pre-war consumption.While it is regarded as unlikely that the whole of the loss of supplies from Holland can be made good, it is expected that the major part of the shortagecan be covered from increased home production and purchases from the Dominionsand the U.S.A.U.     BUTTERTotal G-oB. stocks on 1st June 62,000Ministry&apos;s stocks in cold store on 1st June 51,000Estimated GaB. weekly consumption (June) 5,500During the past few weeks stocks of butter have fallen rapidly.With a 4 ozo ration (which came into force on 3rd June) the decline will continue
but at a much slower rate,   It is expected, however, that it will be possibly to continue the 4 oz, ration for some time and, assuming a favourableproduction season in Australia and New Zealand, a considerable expansion of stocks should take place during the coming winter, following a decline toabout 30,000 tons in October/November.12.     CHEESETonsTotal G-.B. stocks on 1st June 16,000Estimated G.B. weekly consumption (June) &apos; 3,700In view of the high nutritive value of cheese, attempts are beingmade to increase consumption.     The total exportable supplies are beingpurchased from New Zealand and Australia.A further 5,000 tons (in addition to the 35,000 already contracted)is being bought from Canada and an approach has been made to the U.S.A. fora possible purchase of 10,000 tons.Following the cessation of the Treasury subsidy, prices of importedcheese have been increased.,   The Maximum Price Order has, however, reduced the price of home produced cheese, which was unduly high for the season of theyear.13.     EGGSEighty per cent., of our pre-war sources of imported eggs are nowcut offc     This includes the loss of supplies from the Balkans, Turkey and egypt, from which we have recently been obtaining increased quantitiespartially to offset the loss of supplies from the Baltic, Scandinavia andthe Low Countries.Current total imports (which at the moment we are drawing exclusivefrom Canada, Eire and Morocco) are at only one-third of the 1939 level, but itis hoped that, if shipping is available, the proposed imports from Australia,South Africa, the Far East and Argentina will raise imports during October-January 1940/41 to about two-thirds of the 1939/40 level and that with the eggsthat have been stored by the Ministry for release in the autumn the total supply of imported eggs during October-.January will be over 70$ of the normalimports during that periodsIt is difficult bo estimate the output of home-produced eggs next winter;   the output will depend on the supplies of feeding-stuffs.     Thosepoultry keepers who are dependent on purchased feeding-stuffs have been warned that they may have to reduce their flocks to one-third of the present numbers.Those who grow some of their own feeding-stuffs may be able to continue witha less drastic reduction..A plan which envisages the use of authorised packing stations by,home producers and which would, if necessary, place the throughput of suchstations at the Ministry&apos;s disposal to meet localised shortages is underconsideratlbhT14.     TEATotal U.K. stocks on 1st June 146.1 million lbs.Estimated U.K. weekly consumption (June)      10.4      &quot;        &quot;Arrivals during May were reduced by the diversion of merchantshipping from the Mediterranean and arrivals in June are also likely to belower than previous expectations?     While total stocks are at present adequate and sire well distributed throughout the country, it may be necessary, as a precaution against the possibility of a major crisis, to introduce before longa measure of rationing in the interests of maintaining reserves at a suitablelevel.15.     FISHThe landings of fish in May were approximately 750,000 cwts., areduction of 55$ from May 1939.     Landings in June-August are expected to be only about one--third of normal.
0 09w UiRetail prices of fish since the outbreak of war have averaged 34$above the corresponding period a year earlier.     The price rise has been more marked, in.the past four months, and current prices are about 40$ more than ayear age. .   There have, however, been no serious complaints of shortage exceptfrom fish friers, and the general public appear to have adjusted consumption tothe diminished supply without difficulty.The Ministry are arranging to purchase, as an emergency reserve,10,000 tons of canned salmon and 2,000 tons of canned pilchards from the UnitedStates. Arrivals are expected to begin about the end of July.16.     DRIED FRUITStocks of dried fruit&apos;have been reduced to a low level.     If, owing tothe Mediterranean situation shipments, which normally commence in the.early autumn, cannot be made from Greece and Turkey, supplies may soon become&apos; very short.     The complete exclusion of dried fruit from the Mediterranean countries would represent a reduction of more than half the annual imports of dried fruitinto the U.KeA purchase of 15,000 tons of Australian currants and sultanas is being completed and a further purchase of 10,000 tons is under consideration.17.     RICE . .......Total U.K.  stocks on 1st June 61,000 tons estimated weekly consumption (June) 3,000     &quot;Imports of rice during the first year of war are expected to exceed the import programme by a considerable margins     As a result of arrangements madewith the Netherland and Belgian Governments we have been and are still receivingsupplies previously destined for the Low Countires.     We have also been obtainingshipments which were originally en route to Norway, and Sweden.18.     STARCHESArrangements have been made&apos;to replace, by additional imports from theU.S.A. , Java, the Straits Settlements, Brazil and Burma, the loss of anticipatedsupplies of starches (approximately 50,000 tons) in the period June-December 1940consequent upon the. invasion of the Low Countries and Northern France.     It isconsidered that the arrivals now anticipated, together with the stocks already in the country, will be sufficient to meet essential needs.     Present stocks offarina (including farina dextrine) are particularly satisfactory, being sufficientto provide for essential uses for at least two years.19.     FOOD prices the Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of retail food prices fell .one.pointduring May, and at 1st June was 14 per cent higher than on 1st September.Thedecline was due principally to- a seasonal reduction averaging -^d. per. quart in      &apos;.the price of milk;    cheese prices also fell, by Id. per lb. , on the introduction. -of a Maximum Prices Order, and there were small reductions in the prices of eggs and fish.The increase on 1st July of Id. per quart in the retail price of milkwill be equivalent to a rise of 2.14 points In the retail, food index and of 1.28points in the cost-of living index0     Nursing and expectant mothers and children under 5, however, will be able to obtain their milk cheap or free under theCheap Milk Scheme.     Egg Prices, which were slightly below the maximum price on1st June, are rising gradually and are likely to approach the maximum by 1st July.There vri.ll probably also-be- some rise in the price of fish.     The index numberfor potatoes will shew an increase, as the old crop will be exhausted and-consumers, will bebuying new potatoes;    these are falling in. price as larger ..supplies are coming forward. \    -

Since January 1st a high decree of stabilityhas been achieved in the prices of groups 1 and 2.Orders controlling the prices of jam, rice and pulses are in preparation.20.     EFFECTS OF THE ENTRY OF ITALY INTO THE WARDuring July-October 1940 the Ministry had intended to import about400,000 tons of foods and feeds originating in the Mediterranean and adjoiningareas (excluding Spain), representing slightly less than 10 per cent of thetotal proposed imports of these particular commodities from all sources.Assuming that no part of the Mediterranean will be available to British shipping,the loss of these imports will not be serious in the short run.     The expectedshortage of eggs and onions will, however, be accentuated, and the loss ofcottonseed from Egypt will be difficult to replace.     Account must be taken also of the probable loss of Palestinian and, possibly, Spanish winter oranges.Ignoring shipping and exchange problems, it would be possible toreplace a large part of these foodstuffs by additional purchases in theDominions and the United States.     The shipping problem will be accentuated,however, by the need to re-direct the shipping which formerly used the suez canal-Mediterranean route.     The extended journeys will compel either some reduction&apos; in imports from Australia, New Zealand, India and the EasternDependencies, or a proportionate increase in the amount of tonnage allocated to Australasian routes,21,     IMPORT LICENSINGThe Board of Trade issued an Order, with effect from 10th June 1940,prohibiting all imports except under licence.     In view of the recent Cabinetinstruction to stop all non-essential imports, the opportunity was taken when&apos;the new Order was issued to review the general open licences that had beenissued under the earlier Order, and most of these were cancelled.     The basis on which licences have been issued for the various secondary commodities hasbeen reconsidered in order to eliminate any that are not required in thenational interest.     The chief reductions possible are in commodities whichhitherto have been admitted to avoid injury to Empire trade rather thanbecause they were necessary.22.     DIVERSION OF CARGOES CONSIGNED TO THE CONTINENTThe Ministry of Food has agreed to take over and dispose of largequantities of foodstuffs which were being carried in vessels sailing under
the flags of Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Holland, Norway and Sweden, and which,under the terms of the arrangements made with the Governments of those countires,have been discharged here.     These arrangements have enabled the Ministry of food to agree with the Ministry of Shipping for the transfer, for loading steel in North America of some   200,000 tons of shipping which had been allocated for cereals.     A considerable number of cargoes still remain to be dealt with.   Thefollowing statement shows the quantities which had been taken over by theMinistry of Food up to the 8th of June;Summary of foreign cargoes diverted to U.K. up to 8th June,, 1940Destined forTaken over by ministry of FoodNot taken over by ministry of FoodTotalTonsTonsTonsBelgiumDenmarkFinlandHollandIcelandNorwaySweden108,8641,40510,479168,392 (a)110,89950,021450,0603,105691,47219,422 (b)1913,9499,099111 ,9691,47411,951187,814124,84859,1201947,135497,195Tons(a) Includes 4,480 )(b) &quot; 23 )diverted to Francej

REPORT ON FOOD production the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in conjunction with the Secretary ofte for Scotland and the Secretary of State for the Home Department.)(June 15th .1940)Ploughing up Campaign&quot; - - The final return (May 20th) from County Committees shows that approximately 2,035,000 acres of grassland has &quot;been ploughed up in the UnitedKingdom.     Almost the whole of this area represents an increase in tillage(crops plus fallow) &quot;but the increase in arable acreage will &quot;be smaller since there has been much ploughing up of rotation grass already regarded as arable.A substantial part of the increase in tillage in England and wales will consist this year of fallow.     In the ordinary way land under fallowproduces little or nothing.     In order to avoid the waste of a season farmers are being urged to crop their fallow land with catch crops such as rape ormustard, or to divert some of it to roots or kale.As part of the campaign for 1940-41, County Committees in Englandand Wales have been asked to arrange for a survey, to be completed by the endof July, of all farms in their areas.     This will reveal what each holding inthe County is capable of producing, and the supplies of: labour, machinery and fertilisers necessary for optimum production.Crop Conditions:   England and Wales- The weather during May was favourable in most respects.     Wheat hascontinued to improve and the spring &quot;barley and oats are, generally speaking,healthy crops0     There has, however, been fairly substantial damage from wire-worm and leatherjacket on.newly ploughed land.     Winter beans perished widely&quot;but spring sown are a good plant,     Peas have germinated well.     Potato plantingwas.completed under excellent conditions and the main crop is coming throughwell.     Mangolds and turnips are doing well except that the germination of thelatter has been retarded.     Sugar beet is progressing favourably.On June 1st the hay crop promised a yield slightly above average.Pastures have recovered and the quantity of grass on June 1st was plentiful.Livestock have improved in condition and milk yields have risen.     Lambingresults in the later flocks are better than anticipated.Crop Conditions;   Scotland.  The weather during May was favourable for completing the ploughing up of grassland, and other field work, and has benefited the livestock.   Thegrowth of crops, however, was on the whole checked.     Some fields of wheat havehad to be resown with barley, and oats on newly ploughed land are suffering frominsect pests.     The number of iambs is below average.&apos; Crop Conditions;   Northern Ireland. ; All the main crops have been sown under favourable conditions andlook promising.Machinery, The armament drive is having repercussions on the production ofagricultural machines and implements, and some manufacturers are short of steel and component parts.     Some reduction in the output of tractors and implementswill be inevitableo    For example, the Ford. Motor Co. will have to reduce theirtractor production to 75 a day compared with over 100.     Nevertheless, everyeffort is being made to meet farmers&apos; essential requirements.A reserve of 600 Fordson tractors has &quot;been established in anticipation of demands for harvest and autumn ploughing work.     The Ministry&apos;s reserve ofreaper-binders is now &quot;being distributed to County Committees, and arrangements are being made to allocate to them the threshing machines that will be madeavailable to supplement those in the hands of contractors and farmers.
: The following is ,.the, -position in regard to various schemes for supplementary labour:-.Refugees:   It is intended to place many refugees with agriculturalexperience in farm employment through Employment Exchanges.   Some of the menmay be conscripted if necessary.     In addition to Dutch and Belgian refugeesseveral hundred Norwegian whaling seamen are being placed in agriculturalemploymenteConscientious Objectors;     Arrangements are in preparation for placing these in agricultural and forestry \vork.Soldier Labour: The Schemes are in suspense with the cessation of Army leave,SS^HSl^SZ?!    Many County Committees are arranging to form holiday farmingcamps.   The Scheme for facilitating the employment of boys leaving school hasbeen introduced, but it is too early to predict the response.University Students;   Over 1,100 applications for vacation work have beenreceived so far.Roadmen.;     Highway Authorities have been urged to transfer into agricultureevery roadman not at present required for urgent road work,Womon8 s Land Army:     During May the number in employment increased byroughly 1,000 to 7,4000     A steady demand from farmers continues.   Thepresent recruiting aim is 5,000 new volunteers in the next few weeks for regular work and 10,000 for seasonal work     New enrolments for regular worknow number 400 a week,, and 1,500 volunteered for seasonal work during May.Farmers are being asked to assist the training of the women, but there is ashortage of training facilities, especially in dairy work.The reservation age has been reduced from 21 to 18 for four of themore important occupational groups in agriculture, and market garden workers are now placed on the same footing as agricultural workers.     The reservationago has been reduced from 25 to 21 for certain other horticulturaloccupations, and fixed respectively at 30 and 25 for land drainage workers and the technical staff of Local Authorities and commercial firms.The national minimum wage for ordinary male workers&apos; in England andWales was fixed at 48/- on June 7th to take effect on July 1st.   This is approximately 10/- higher than the previous average minimum wage.     Consider-ation is being given to fixing lower minima for new entrants in view of theprobable large influx of inexperienced workers.No statutory provision exists for fixing a national minimum wage inScotland,.     It is proposed to give effect, to the Government&apos;s plans within the framework of the Agricultural Wages Regulation (Scotland) Acts, 1937 and 1940,The Ministry of Health is assisting County Committees to securesuitable accommodation for agricultural workers.     Committees have been authorised to hire, purchase and convert disused railway carriages, buses,lorries, caravans, etc,, and to take possession of houses, barns, etc, in exceptional cases.As an accompaniment to the raising of wages in agriculture - to aminimum of 48/- in England and Wales - it is intended that agricultural workers at present in agriculture shall be prevented from leaving, and that those inother employment shall return to agriculture when that employment ends.Labour short age this spring&apos;has not been, as acute as expected.Owing to weather conditions sugar beet hoeing has been spread out over a longer period than usual.   Several County Committees have organised gangs of looalvolunteer labour for root hoeing.   Much volunteer labour is likely to beavailable for seasonal work, but so far there has been difficulty in placing those who do not live..,on the spot.
Prices of Agricultural ProductsThe revision of agricultural prices necessitated by the adoption of anational minimum wage of 48/- per week, and by other increases in costs, isunder active consideration in consultation with the other Departments concerned,and with representatives of the farmers.Feeding Stuffs and LivestockSupplies of feeding stuffs during the past month have been generallyadequate in view of the tendency among farmers to make the maximum use of grazingand to restrict to a lower level than usual their consumption of purchasedfeeding stuffs at this season of the year.     In order to meet a possible if notprobable heavy decline in imports and to enable a start to be made in building up reserves for this winter, pig and poultry producers (more especially thosedependent on purchased feeding stuffs) have been strongly urged to restrictforthwith breeding and hatching, and to arrange for the orderly reduction of thenumbers of their stock.     Discussions have taken place with representatives ofthese classes of producers with the object of determining the best method ofcarrying out the necessary severe reduction in numbers of stock and of mitigatingthe hardship which will be entailed.On the advice of the Military and Civil Defence Authorities, steps arebeing taken to halve the number of sheep on Romney Marsh (a heavily stooked area in Kent) in order to mitigate the loss of a valuable food supply in the event ofmilitary operations. Consideration is also being given to the possible partialevacuation or slaughter of livestock in other vulnerable coastal areas.Milk production the following figures relate to the United Kingdom in million gallons;-*Liquid Manufacturing TotalMay, 1939 75.6 54.7 130.2April, 1940 71.7 25.2 96.9May, 1940 74.0 51.7 125.6Although the May 194Q- figure is below the record figure for May 1939,it compares very well with the years 1935/1958.Animal HealthAn outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Kesteven (Lines.) was confirmed on June 11th.     The swine fever figure remains at a high level.
