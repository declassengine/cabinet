15th Fortnightly Report submitted, by the Secretary for mines covering the period 1st to 14th April.Coal Position.Supplies.There has been a marked recovery in production since the easter holidays.      Por each of the two weeks ending the13th April the gross output35 of coal has exceeded five million tons for the first time &quot;for more than twelve months.      Thisrecovery, coupled with the seasonal decline in demand forheating and lighting purposes, has materially eased the suppliesposition.      At the same time,  the arrears of demand are stillconsiderable, as are the requirements of coal for stockingpurposes.It is perhaps inevitable that this improvement in thesupplies position has not been uniform in all districts and thisis particularly the case in regard to house coal.      Shortages ofthis class of coal are still being experienced in a few large towns, in some of the remoter rural areas and in certain of the districts most dependent on seaborne supplies.    London appears tohave slightly improved its position and has accepted only 9 ofthe 20 train loads of house coal allotted to it under the7th special weekly programme (due to commence on 17th April)for the railing of 46 train loads of house eoal from the Northto the South.      Accordingly,  the allocation of coal trains forthat week to other destinations in the Southern counties hasbeen increased from 26 to 37? as a result of which it is hopedfurther to improve the house coal position in those areas.The position of the Public Utilities has been slightlystrengthened by an improvement, though again not uniform,  intheir coal reserves,&apos; and the number of weak spots (i. e.undertakings with not more than 2 weeks&apos;  supply in reserve)declined from 206 in the week ended 30th March to 159 for theweek ended 6th April in the case of gas companies,  and from 9 to6 in the case of electricity companies.    The returns of actual stocks show that for the country as a whole the reserves ofelectricity works rose to 2,008,000 tons for the week ended6th April as compared with 1,974,000 tons for the previous week.During this period, however, the stocks at gas undertakings fellby 11,000 tons to 1,343,000 tons.Por London and the South of England there was, on the otherhand, a small increase in the coal reserves of both electricity and gas works.    It may be mentioned in this connection that theDepartment continues to arrange for the railing weekly of 124special train loads of coal from the North, of which 27 havebeen running under the initial war programme and the remaining97 under the more recent special emergent programme.    the returns indicate that the previous decline in the coal reserves of Public Utilities in London and the Southern Counties havebeen definitely arrested and that a movement in the reversedirection has begun.*The figures quoted in the next section of this report are those of saleable coal, i. e, ,  the tonnage available,after the removal of certain waste matter in preparingcoal for the market by screening, washing,  etc.

30th March 4.606th April 5.6413th April (provisional)     5c65Exports,?A number of countries are, like ourselves, still endeavouringto make good the depletion of their stocks during the past fewmonths, with the result that demand has continued to outrun thesupply of coal available for export.      Though we may expect somedrop in Italian demand and a cessation of the supply of coal toScandinavian markets, home and French demands are so great thatthere will be great difficulty in meeting demands by othercountries.      The latest returns for coal shipments are as follows:-The greatest pressure upon supplies for current consumptionis now corning from an ever widening range of industries engageddirectly and indirectly upon war work.      The Department is givingevery&apos;attention to this problem and it may be said thatthe requirements of these industries are being reasonably met,though not without some difficulty.production and Employment.A further fall in output was recorded for the week ended30th March, which included Easter Monday and Tuesday.      In thetwo succeeding weeks there was, however, a sharp recovery.   AsEaster fell at a different c&quot;te last year from this, comparisonsof output and time worked in the corresponding week last year are of no value and are not given.Estimated quantity of Saleable Goal Raised.Week ended - 1940.Ton So30th March 3,728,9006th April &apos; 4,864,40013th April (provisional) 4,876^000Total 13,469-,000   &apos;The loss of output attributable to the Easter holidays thisyear (during the two weeks ended 30th March) was 1,500,000 tons.This compares with 1,880,000 tons lost owing to Easter holidayslast year (during the fortnight ended 15th April, 1939).Employment continues to be practically stationary.      the holiday factor is reflected in the loss of working time at the   Bpits for the week ended 30th March.Week ended - Corresponding_1940_ week, 1939Wage Earners.30th March                                       762,100 770,2006th April                                        762,300 769,60013th April (provisional)             763,400 . 770,900The number employed in the week ended 9th September, 1939,was 748,600. &quot; -Time Worked (days) .

This decision apparently has for the time being brought to an end the intermittent and unofficial strikes in thecoalfield,,The National Union of Scottish Mine Workers is negotiating with the owners&apos;  representatives a new wages agreement to takethe place of that which expired on 31st January, but under whichthe men have   been working on a temporary basis ever since.
