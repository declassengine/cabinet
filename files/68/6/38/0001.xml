The Finnish Government are also anxious to open up a new route viaskibotn.     This would entail considerable work in Finland and the con-struction of 12 kilometres of roau in Norway in addition to improvementof the port.

At a meeting; on the 2oth May, &quot;it was decided, in view of the prob-ability of German.aggression, that .

The Master of the Rolls, having reported, he had discovered.&apos; a basis for an agreement with the Italian Government which he describes as sat-satisfactory, returned from Rome on Sunday 26th May.      The formula con-sisted of a State guarantee covering imports&quot;of key commodities, com-bined with the maintenance of the Navicert system.  &apos;  as was agreedbefore his departure.from London an announcement was made as a unilat-eral gesture to the. Italian Government that the Allies would refrain from stopping or diverting Italian ships in connexion with theirContraband Control.operations, and this led to the acceptance of theformula referred to. ... The subject of the control of enemy exports-wasavoided though in practice instructions have been given to the naval authorities to divert, or stop neither inward nor outward bound italian ships, and only.to exercise control operations g^ erally. on shipsputting voluntarily into Allied ports.6.     Since, the above was written, information has been received thatthe negotiations Mva be^n broken off and that Mr. Nicholls is on his way back.greece&apos; - - &apos;7.     Further observations have been received from the Greek government about their requirements., -for the. purpose of/rationing, under List B ofthe Anglo-Greek War Trade. Agreement..   The only items which now remain to be settled are copper products, nickel,.jute, cotton and tin.8.  At the/
8. At the end of last week the Greek Government informed His Majesty&apos;s Government that a German Delegation was arriving in Athens on May 27th and they had grave reason to think that, unless they were authorised to increase the quantities of certain Greek products which could be exported to Germany under List A of the War Trade Agreement, the Germans would break off all commercial relations with Greece. This was a very serious question for them as they counted on the Germans to take Â£4,000,000 worth of Greek tobacco. Reference was made to the letter attached to the War Trade Agreement in which His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government had undertaken to consider the situation which might arise from the total interruption of Greco-German trade as the direct result of action taken under the War Trade Agreement. The Greek Government stated that, rather than be placed in the position of having to appeal to His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government for assistance in accordance with the terms of this letter, they hoped it would be possible for slight concessions to be made regarding the quantities of goods to be exported to Germany. As a result of these representations, His Majesty&apos;s Government have stated their willingness to make slight increases in the quantities of colophony, turpentine, olive oil, olive kernel oil and manganese ore, which Greece may export to Germany under List A of the agreement, and they have also agreed to the export of 1,000 tons of chrome. Instructions are being sent to H.M. Minister in Athens to inform the Greek Government accordingly, provided that his French colleague has been similarly instructed.

ROUMANIA

9. The quotas under the Roumanian Rationing Agreement have been closed for tin; cotton waste, lubricating oils, copper sulphate and ferro-chrome.

BULGARIA

10. Negotiations for the conclusion of a rationing agreement have been opened with the Bulgarian Minister in London, and he has been handed the draft of an agreement similar to those recently concluded with Yugoslavia and Roumania. Simultaneous discussions are proceeding with the Treasury and Board of Trade about a Payments Agreement designed to tie up the sterling which Bulgaria would derive from United Kingdom purchases; and provision will also be made for Bulgaria to reserve for purchase by the United Kingdom certain quantities of commodities which interest His Majesty&apos;s Government in return for assurances regarding the supply of United Kingdom and Empire goods. One of the most important objects to be achieved in these negotiations will be the limitation of the transit trade in Soviet oil for Germany, which has been developing recently. It has been suggested to the Bulgarian Minister that a quota should be fixed for imports of oil products into Bulgaria from all sources, and for all purposes including transit. This quota would not be large enough to enable Bulgaria to pass on any substantial quantities of petroleum products to Germany. The Bulgaria Minister, though he has naturally not committed his Government, has so far given no indication that proposals on these lines would be impracticable, but he has asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Government could help Bulgaria in any way by providing the foreign currency required by Bulgaria for the purchase of oil. It is possible that some bargain on these lines may be struck which would reduce Germany&apos;s receipts of Soviet oil.

SOVIET RUSSIA

11. A note has been prepared for the British delegation to Moscow to show the objectives of the Ministry of Economic Warfare in the forthcoming trade conversations with the Soviet Government. The note considers in the first place a possible Anglo-Soviet barter arrangement and draws attention to the special points connected with economic warfare which would have to be taken into account when discussing this matter
13*    a further conversation has been hela with a representative&quot;of theJapanese Embassy regarding the despatch of goods to Germany by the.Trans-Siberian Railway, raid other trace questions.     The Japanese&quot;Gov-erament seem.ready -*tc agree not to re-export to Germany their importsfrom the British empire, provided that they are assured of the imports which they require.      The Japanese jjnbassy have been told that His .Majesty&apos;s Government re-quire more than this,.. and--have been asked to ...emphasise to their Government that a prohibition&apos;of re-export to Ge-r--raany is required in respect of all overseas imports of key commodities.,The Japanese Embassy have urged that export of Japan&apos;s own products toGermany should not be restricted in any way, and on this.point it hasbeen suggested to them that they should at -least limit their exports ofindigenous products to the normal quantities,- 14c    The Japanese Embassy have also communicated semi-officially a listshowing the commodities which they wish to&quot;.obtain from British Empireterritories.     They have been informed that certain of the -commoditieson this list are of military importance, and.greatly needed by theAllies.      This applied particularly to nickel, wolfram, mica and zincore, and possibly some other items.15.    The Japanese have, urged that the scope of the discussions mightbe broadened to cover .the supply of Japanese commodities to the Unitedkingdom and the Empire,  and have supplied a list of the commodities.: available,      They have been informed&apos; that several items on this listare of interest&quot; to us, but that shipping may be difficult. to:&apos;arrange,16.    The Japanese have been informed that His&quot; Majesty1 s Governmentwould have to press for a Payments, agreement and for a &quot;lifting of therestrictions oh British imports into Japan...II.

It alsopoints out that great care must be taacen as regards the supply toRussia of dangerous commodities such as rubber ana. tin.     The note alsodeals with the question of contraband control in the Pacific and transittrade via Vladivostock.      It draws attention to the. difficulty ofobtaining reliable guarantees from the Soviet Government, and. concludesthat it is essential to reserve belligerent rights to intercept cargoesin the Pacific in respect of which there is evidence that they are tobe transmitted to Germany,CHINA -12..   An offer has been made to the French Government by the ChineseGovernment to cell to the Allies the whole Chinese output of wolframfor U2 months.     The Chinese Government estimate their output at 15,000tons a year,  and ask that the whole of the order should be paid for onthe signature of the contract.      Although-these Chinese proposals donot seem to be acceptable in their present form, consideration is &quot;being given to the desirability of putting forward, some counter offer on thebasis of the purchase of existing stocks together with some provision -covering future output.japan

In the remainingcase it was reported to the Committee that a-writ had already been ;issued jat Gibraltar in respect of certain cargo voluntarily unloaded, inorder1 to enable the ship to proceed.27.    as a result of this case, the Committee appointedto consider the general question as to the- procedurecargo was voluntarily unloaded- as the alternative toa sub-Committeeto &quot;be :adopted vJBjrethe detention-01 acn the basis of the Sub-Committee&apos;s report, -the Commit teeship.decided that instructions shouldthe option to discharge goods&apos; ihbe/given that where a Master exercisedorder to avoid delaying the ship, the master/
Master must be called upon to give an Undertaking on behalf of the Ship Owners to provide for the warehousing of the goods.

28. The Committee considered a report by Prof. Bentwich on the question of the shipment of Lift vans belonging to refugees proceeding overseas from Italian ports, and approval a scheme whereby, provided the concurrence of the Italian Authorities could be obtained, the shipment of these Lift Vans could be permitted after examination by a Refugee Committee and a representative of the local British Consulates.

29. The Committee also approved a report of a Sub-Committee which had been appointed to consider the procedure which should be adopted for ensuring an effective enemy export control of Passengers&apos; Luggage and Effects.

30. The Committee considered thirteen specific applications for exemption, granting eight, refusing three and deferring consideration of two, in addition to six applications treated summarily of which four were granted and two refused.

31. The Committee considered 16 cases in which Consuls asked for instructions as to the issue of certificates of origin.  These requests came principally from consuls in Italy, and the principle generally followed by the committee was to direct the granting of Certificates except where there was an absolutely clear case for refusal.

32. The Committee considered and approved a report of a sub-Committee which had been appointed to consider the question of Royalty and Licence payments to enemy interests in connection with the issue of Certificates of Origin.

33. Five recommendations were made on this subject and were referred for the approval of the Ministere du Blocus.

GENERAL EXPORT QUESTIONS

34. For political reasons a number of applications for exemption submitted by U.S.A. firms and previously refused, have now been granted. The goods concerned are mostly lying at Dutch and Belgian ports and will be sent by rail to Italian ports for shipment to the U.S.A.

35. Dr. Dye, of the U.S. Embassy, has requested that all applications by U.S.A. firms to be permitted to ship German goods, whether formerly refused or still under consideration,  should now be granted.     A concession of this sweeping character could scarcely be confined to a single country, but the matter is under consideration.

36. With regard to the abandonment of control over Italian ships (see paragraph 22) vessels of the Italia Line which by private agreement call voluntarily at Gibraltar, are continuing to do so. It is hoped, with the aid of U.S.A. and South American governments, to be able to introduce a satisfactory scheme for holding-back outward cargoes at ports destination.

37. For the time being, Spanish vessels voyaging from continental Spain to Spanish possessions are not being subjected to enemy export control.
