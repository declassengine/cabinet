Ministry of Economic Warfare,- -V  First&apos; Monthly Report on. Action, taken for the -period. 10 thJune to loth July., 19U0GENERAL:      The events&apos;of the past three months have radically changed the conditions under which economic warfare must he waged.     with northern Europe under German control and the Mediterranean closedby Italy&apos;s entry into the war? contraband control, previously thechief weapon of the economic war, becomes relatively unimportant.-Almost everywhere in Europe it must now be replaced, -so far as thenaval situation allows, by simple &quot;blockade&quot;, by the prevention ofthe passage of ships to Northern Europe and into the Mediterranean.But even before the defeat of France a complete naval blockade wasnot possible, while the fact that the Turkish Government have notclosed the passage from the Black Sea inevitably reduces the press-pre that could be exercised on the enemy by the complete blockingof the three exits from the Mediterranean,    - It was therefore clearthat naval blockade must be supplemented by export control in over-seas and colonial territories, which would tend to replace contra-band control as the main weapon of economic warfare.      There seemedto be good prospects that it would be no less effective a weapon.It was hoped that export control would rapidly be made effectivethroughout the four Allied Empires;    that it .would be&apos;.powerfullysupported both by (export control in the U.S.A., as the result ofthe Defence Bill now passed by Congress which sets up an exportlicensing system for key commodities, and by U.3. purchases of rawmaterials for defence purposes;    and that the South american countries would follow the lead of the U.S. Government.     An import-ant additional weapon would be found in the control of world shipping.2. The disaster in France and especially the collapse of theFrench Empire has been a severe blow for this new policy.     Butthere is still every reason to hope that we shall be able to keep up our economic pressure on the enemy by the combined use of naval&quot;blockade, world shipping control and export control overseas.     &quot;the prosecution of economic warfare will however involve this countryin political problems of the greatest importance and world-wideeffect,     Por the maintenance of the blockade of Europe will causegreat suffering in all enemy and enemy-oocupied territories, while in overseas countries primary producers will see the accumulation&apos;of surpluses for which, owing to the blockade, there is no market.The opportunity which this situation will provide for enemy, propa-ganda is obvious.      It might well produce a wide movement to force this country to stop the war.      it will certainly result in pressure from many sides,&apos; and especially from the exiled Governments and fromhumanitarians in the &quot;U.S.A., to allow relief cargoes through theblockade..     The attitude of the United States Government will be of vital importance in meeting all these difficulties.     Every effort is- being, made to enlist their understanding and support and thereare good grounds for hoping that they will be forthcoming.      The&apos;Administration have already taken a most important initiative. in,&apos;announcing that they are preparing plans for dealing with commoditysurpluses in the Western Hemisphere, which are to be considered bya Fan-American Conference at Havana convened for the 21st July.3. To meet the new conditions, the Ministry of Economic Warfarehas been re-organised.      Its staff has been considerably reduced.CO-OPERATION BY THE ALLIED EMPIRES IN BLOCKADE MEASURES    .k. The effect of the entrance of the Belgian and NetherlandsEmpires.into the war against Germany at the time when France was still our ally was to give to the allied Empires a very large degreeof direct control over a number of important raw materials.     M.E.W.therefore evolved a policy of co-ordinated export control between theallied/
- 2 -allied Empires for economic warfare purposes.      An Inter-AlliedMinisterial Conference, at bended by the Minister of Economic warfare and the JJnder-Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, Dominions   mand Colonies and the Deputy Under-Secretary of State for India andhy representatives of the French, Belgian and Netherlands Govern-ments, was held at the Minis try on June 17th.      The meeting had before it a Draft Statement of Policy in the following terms:-&quot;The representatives of the four Allies in consultationi) consider that the vigorous prosecution of the economicwar against the enemy constitutes an essential factor in the ultimate victory of the Allies;2) resolve that, since the four Allied Empires jointlycommand the major part of the essential raw materials and commodities of the world,  the export of these comm-odities and - materials shall he so controlled as totallyto deny the use of them to the enemy;3) agree that such control cannot satisfactorily he estab-lished without the imposition in all territories - of theAllied Empires of a system for licensing exports;li) resolve that such systems shall, where., not already inexistence, be imposed and that they should be co-ordinatedin scope and practice and in the policy governing&apos; their operation;5) direct that a Committee of experts, representing the fourAllies,  shall examine how best these resolutions and this&apos;&apos; policy may be implemented;6) agree to meet again from time to time, as &quot;-required toreceive reports from the committee of experts and toundertake any necessary action.&quot;5. &quot;      The meeting was, of course, overshadowed by great events, butthe foreign representatives ail adhered in principle.: to the State-ment of Policy.      The task of the Expert Committee in implementing the Statement has been retarded by rapid political changes, butprogress has been made.     Thus the Netherlands.Government have introduced a system of export control for blockade, purposes andtheir expert representative is in close touch with the Ministry.In the case of the Congo, no exports whatever have- taken place since&apos;May 10th, but a system is now being introduced-by which all goods are subject to licence before export.     No goods whatever are to be exported to territories under enemy sovereignty.,, protection or con-trol.     Licences are. to be granted freely to the British Empire and north and South America, save that special restrictions will applyto the export of cobalt and diamonds to South America.     All applic-ations for licence to expert goods to other destinations will bereferred by the Congo authorities to the Belgian Embassy in Londonand the decision - to grant or withhold a licence will rest with theInter-Allied Expert Committee sitting.in the Ministry.6. It is hoped when the situation in the.French Empire clarifiesitself further that progress will be made with an export controlpolicy, co-ordinated between the four Allied Empires and the U.S.A.III.RELATIONS WITH NEUTRAL STATES     -SPAIN7. With the conquest of France by Germany the question of contraband/
contraband control for Spain has assumed a new importance.      Theproblem is, in the first instance, a naval one, since no control*  will be effective unless itican be applied to ships entering the&quot;  Atlantic ports.     This.aspect of the question is being studied bythe Admiralty in conjunction with the M.E.W.8. In the meantime, according to our information, Spanish stocks are low, except in the case of petroleum and possibly cotton.     TheU.S. Government have shown considerable readiness to co-operate with us in preventing abnormal shipments of petroleum to Spain, and itis hoped to limit Spanish imports until such time as stocks arereduced to the desired level to the quantities which can be carried in her own tankers.9. The treatment to be accorded to other commodities destined for Spain is under consideration.SWITZERLAND10.       The collapse of France has destroyed the basis of the war trade Agreement, since Switzerland now finds herself surrounded by enemy territory with little prospect of exporting her manufacturesto markets not hostile to the United Kingdom.     A German Delegationarrived in Berne towards the end of June, and is pressing the Swiosto increase exports of certain goods to Germany above the levelsallowed under the War Trade Agreement.     Since the capitulation ofFrance only one ship carrying U.S.A. coal has been allowed through our control.HUNGARY AND THE BALKANS11.       With the closing of the Mediterranean the chief problem ccn-cerning economic warfare in the Balkans is to decide whether cargoesfor these countries should be allowed to enter the Mediterraneanor proceed from Egype, and, if so, in what quantities and underwhat conditions.     On the entry of Italy into the war the export ofall goods to Mediterranean countries was made subject to export licence in the United Kingdom and Empire countries, outstandingexport licences were revoked and the issue of further export lic-ences was, in fact., suspended.     Similar action was taken withregard to navicerts for these countries.      This does not apply to turkey for whom export licences and navicerts are continuing to beissued, provided that the goods are routed round the Cape.12. Instructions have now been sent to H.M. Representatives in hungary, Roumania, Greece, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia explaining thegeneral lines pf our proposed policy with regard to supplies forthese countries, and giving them guidance in case they are approach-d-by the Governments concerned.      As regards Hungary, owing tc thecomplete unreliability of any undertakings which their Governmentmay give, it is not proposed to permit the passage of any supplies,except insofar as it may be possible to carry out any isolated, dealsinvolving the pre-emption of important Hungarian commodities.Similarly, Roumania and Bulgaria are considered to be now toeexposed to enemy influence for it to be worthwhile making any effort to facilitate the passage of supplies to them.      If, however,  itproves possible to continue pre-emptive purchases, it may be necess-ary to arrange for comparatively innocuous cargoes to reach Rotun.auiaand Bulgaria.      Yugoslavia and Greece are in rather a different$ position, since there is still hope that we may be able to securevaluable minerals from these countries, in particular chrome andmagnesite from Greece, and chrome and lead from Yugoslavia.      Inaddition, the Anglo-Greek War Trade Agreement: is still in existence and it is important   to do what we can to encourage the Greeks tothink/
- k -think that we can assist them economically.     Provided, therefore,that Greece and Yugoslavia observe their undertakings towards us and make it possible for us to obtain their minerals, we shall he    a ready to help them in obtaining supplies, though, naturally, we shalllimit carefully all raw materials of any value.13.. Any cargoes which are to be obtained by these countries will only be permitted to enter the Mediterranean subject to the foliow-ing conditions:(a) That/safe conduct from the Italians is received.(b) That we have some way of checking the loading of cargoes atthe exporting end and facilities for examining the unloadingat the importing end, in order to make&apos; sure that the wholecargo arrives safely.(c) That each cargo is approved as a whole, as not containing too much in the way of valuable raw materials.lh.       The Greek Government have already obtained a safe conductfrom the Italians for four coal ships which were on their way fromthe United Kingdom to Greece, and for three wheat ships on their way from Australia.      One coal ship and one wheat ship were allowed toproceed from Gibraltar and Aden respectively as test cases, and thecoal ship has already arrived safely.     Accordingly, two more coalships have been allowed to proceed, the fourth having been sunk beforefshe reached Gibraltar.15.       The Yugoslav Government have obtained an interesting assurance!from the Italian authorities to the effect that all goods, irrespective-tive of origin, destined for Yugoslavia, provided they are carried injneutral ships, will be allowed through the Mediterranean.     this assurance, if observed, would make it possible for us to continueour sales to Yugoslavia in return for the minerals reserved for us &apos;under the Yugoslav Minerals Protocol.16.       It is proposed that the supply of raw materials from the Empireand of United Kingdom goods should, so far as possible, be concen-trated in the hands of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation,who are making good progress in arranging for stocks to be built upin Turkey and Egypt for distribution to Balkan countries in the.event of it being worthwhile to maintain commercial relations.17.       H.M. Ambassador in Washington was informed on June 16th ofthe general lines on which the Balkan countries would be allowed toreceive cargoes and he was instructed to approach the U.S. Govern-ment with a view to obtaining their co-operation, both in allowingus to check the loading of cargoes and in forbidding neutral ships to sail for the Mediterranean without some special pass, in order toavoid inconvenience arising from their detention at Gibraltar.     TheState Department have, however, not seen their way tp help us in this manner, but suggest that it is up to us to exercise our own controland put difficulties in the way of ships which try to carry unnavi-certed cargo.GREECE18.       The Greek Government have made an urgent request to be allowedto supply to Germany quantities of colophony, olive oil, olive ke::oil and turpentine, considerably in excess of the amounts poririttedin the War Trade Agreement, in return for German arms.     The GreekGovernment maintain that the war-like preparations of Bulgaria makeit vital that they should obtain these armaments as soon as possible-It has/
It has hesn pointed out to them in reply that it is highly unlikelythat Bulgaria would attack Greece unless instigated by Germany, but$ that if the Greeks really desire these armaments for the defence oftheir country, we shall let them send these quantities of Greekproduce on the assumption that they will insist on obtaining theirarmaments before parting with such valuable raw materials.19.       The Greek Government have also informed H.M. Minister at athens that they have successfully concluded a commercial agreementwith Germany within the limits laid down by the Anglo-Greek war trade Agreement, -   The Graeco-German agreement, however, comes to anend on August 31st, and the Greek Government say that they will be compelled to request His Majesty&apos;s Government to release them from some of the obligations contracted in the War Trade Agreement,since, owing to the difficult situation in the Mediterranean HisMajesty&apos;s Government will not be in a position to carry out theirown obligations in that agreement.     The Greek Government have beeninformed that we do not feel called upon to give a detailed replyat present to their approach, but that we do not consider outselvesincapable of meeting our obligations under the War Trade Agreement.It is hoped that in the meantime the y.K.C.G.. will have made moreprogress with their arrangements for holding stocks of raw materials and that these potential supplies will induce the Greeks to take astiffer line with the Germans.20.       We have succeeded in arranging for the Chrome Company, whoacted as our purchasing agents in Greece, to sell the whole 47.000tons of Greek chrome for which we contracted to their correspondentsMessrs. E.J. Lavino of Philadelphia-,     The title to the 25,000 tonsalready in stock piles in Greece Is being transferred to thisAmerican name and, in co-opsrat4.on with the Chrome Company, Messrs.Lavino are endeavouring to charter chips in their own name to remove the chrome.     We still have an interest in the chrome, because we/have guaranteed Messrs&apos;. - Lavino. -against loss and are continuing to finance it.     This is, of course, being kept secret to avoid anysuspicion of British interest.TURKEY21.       Protracted negotiations for the purchase of Turkish chromeunder the tripartite Agreement were being carried on by a: Frenchgroup, which has disappeared as a result of the capitulation ofFrance.     In the new circumstances, it has been decided that a straightforward bargain with Turkey to purchase the whole of heroutput at  5 a ton ( a more than fair price) would much simplifymatters and would eliminate haggling each time a new purchase hadto&apos; be made.     An offer in these terms has been made&apos;,through H.M.Ambassador in Angora, and the Turkish reaction is awaited.YUGOSLAVIA22.       Arrangements are being made for British purchases of Yugoslavlead and zinc to be removed to Istanbul.23.       A small shipment of 1,300 tons of Yugoslav chrome has recentlyleft for America, and we are endeavouring to arrange for a further3,000 tons to be moved in the same direction..^  ROUMANIA -2lfi       The evacuation of the British-owned tugs and barges on the danube is proceeding active].y-     Four motor tankers and 17 tankerstotalling 15,8h7 tons, 11 British barges totalling 12,hh0 tons andone French lighter of 1,335 tons have already left for Istanbul.Sea-going/
Sea-going tugs have been&apos; chartered, to do the bulk of the towing, sin^sriver tugs are not considered suitable for crossing the Black Sea; &quot;:they are, however, being utilised to some extent.     There remain about10 grain barges, 5 tugs and, possibly,  6 grain elevators to be evac-.uated;   with the facilities at present available, and if the weatherholds,&apos;the work should he completed by about the middle of July,   Theevacuated vessels will he utilised for storage purposes at Istanbul.25.       A proportion of the French. Danube fleet has already been eyac-uated to Istanbul, and this.portion of the fleet, amounting to- about50 vessels, lias been transferred to the British flag.     The roumanian government, acting under German pressure, are obstructing the transfer from the French to the British flag of those vessels which are stillin the Danube, and have issued instructions to prevent their leaving the river.      The Secretary of State, for Foreign /affairs has protestedto the Roumanian Minister about this action on the part of the Roum-anian Government, and until the matter is arranged any Roumanianvessels arriving at British-controlled ports in the-Mediterranean willbe held.U.S.S.R.26.       Sir Stafford Cripps has now had an opportunity of broachingthe- question of a barter deal with M. Molotov and M. Stalin.     M,Sta&apos;has indicated that the Soviet will not break its economic agreementwith Germany, and that one of the terms of this agreement is the sup-ply by the Soviet to Germany of part of the non-ferrous metalsrequired for the manufacture of goods in Germany for the Soviet.   M,Stalin has stated frankly that if this arrangement is an impedimentto agreement with us, then such an agreement will not he achieved.27.       Detailed proposals for a barter deal have been taken to Moscowby Mr. Gifford of the Ministry of Economic Warfare.      If these propos-als materialise successfully and without the introduction of other commodities into the deal than those at present contemplated, thearrangement for sending raw material to Germany for manufacture and return to the U-.S.S.R. will only involve tin.     The gist of M.&quot;Stalingconversation seems, however, to have envisaged a wider field for it,and the instructions to be sent to Sir Stafford Cripps on this pointare still under consideration.     Apart -from this arrangement theSoviet has no intention, according: to M. Stalin, of for war ding.&apos; import -ied goods to Germany, but has only agreed to supply Germany with her&quot;&apos;own surplus products.      Subject therefore to the resolution of the initial difficulty already mentioned, the stage is set for trade talksU.S .A.Export &apos;Trade    -28.       His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington has approached the U.S.Government regarding possible measures for control of shipping and &apos;cargoes that might be effected in the U.S.A. to relieve the pressure on our blockade.      The most notable response has been that of theU .S.- Maritime Commission which, according to a report from Washingtonis refusing to approve further charters of American flag tankers tocarry oil to Spain, Portugal and Taneriffe and is considering thepossibility of extending the ban to cover all tankers under charter to U.S. Companies, whether flying the America:.! flag or not.     The     $Maritime Commission^ idea is apparently to require a &quot;pass&quot; from theblockading belligerent before permitting any. sailing to these destin-ations.   .2.9.       The control and inspection of cargoes on vessels bound forBalkan/I
o4oBalkan countries which might he permitted to pass through Gibraltarj$ or Suez has been mentioned in parhgrapn 17 above-     The possibilityof insisting that all American cargoes bound for Europe should obtainnavicerts has been .explored,     The State Department is not yet pre-pared to go to anything like these lengths but their general attitude is -helpful, and two important shipping companies - the D.8. Lines and american Export Lines - will go as far as they can to get navicertsfrom all their shippers.     At the same time, Lord Lothian has emphas-ised that if an appreciable number of ships destined for Europe andespecially for the Iberian Peninsular are stopped and are made to suffer difficulties on account of non-navicerted cargo, the shipping lines will be able to insist that all cargo should be -navicerted.It appears that the U.S. Government would see no objection to this.Defence Bill \&apos;30. -    His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington reports that Section of the new U.S. Defence Act has now been drafted in such a way as toallow wide interpretation of the categories of war supplies coveredby it.     The Bill has been passed by both Houses of Congress.31.       On June 11th Lord Lothian handed the Secretary of State a mem-memorandum about the commodities the control of which by the U.3. Govern-ment would.be helpful to us.Disposal of Commodity S\irrluses.32.     On receipt rfofficial intimation that the U.S. administration was preparing plans for dealing with commodity surpluses in the West-era Hemisphere, it was decided thai our interest in the matter shouldhe brought. to their attention,     Accordingly on June 29th Lord Lothianwas instructed to inform the U.S. Government that we were surveyingthe problem of surplus commodities in territories of the British Empireand territories under our control, and that our survey would Includeinvestigation of the possibility of dealing with surpluses -by .regu-lated sales, storage, destruction etc,.     Lord Lothian- was furtherinstructed to state that we were deeply interested in the U..S. init-iative with regard to American surpluses and to point out that while our objectives differed the two problems inevitably overlapped, andthat we hoped that any decisions which might be taken at the Pan-American Conference would not preclude co-operation with -us.;*---?;&quot;:&quot;Financial &apos;^&quot;:&quot;h-&apos;&quot;T7&apos;33.    &apos; The Executive Order freezing the assets of occupied countries was extended on June 17th. tn cover French- assets.JAPAN -.......... --   -34.       Conversations between the Director-General and the Counsellorof the Japanese Embassy continued during the month.-.    It has become apparent that any-agreement on War Trade and Contraband Controlquestions will be of a limited nature and confined to - those materials which are imported into Japan from British Empire sources.     these conversations are closely bound up with the Payments Agreement whichthe Treasury has proposed to the Japanese,     The Japanese Governmenthave now made counter-proposals on this question and it is hoped thatthese negotiations may be brought to a conclusion in&apos; the near future.The conclusions reached in regard to trade&apos; questions and contraband control would then be embodied in an exchange of letters.china / :35.    -. As a. result of the collapse of France as a consumer and the-   - report/
report of unexpectedly large stocks in China, the wolfram question has assumed proportions which could he dealt with only &quot;by an except-ionally big pre-eurotive operation,     A considerable shipment of tinhas been licensed through Kong Kong to Vladlvostock under the Sino-Soviet barter Agreement.NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES36.       The Government in the Netherlands East Indies have agreed tosupply to Japan the full list of requirements of raw materials, whichwas handed to the Dutch Ambassador in Tokyo.     They are, however,resisting the Japanese wish for increased immigration and concessionsIt does not appear likely that the acquisition cf N.E.I. products by japan will be of any immediate or direct help to our enemies.IRAN37.       The possibilities of a War Trade Agreement have been examinedbut no basis for such an agreement has been found.      The Governmentof India have been requested to endeavour to absorb Iranian cotton(as well as Afghan) in their markets and to consider the possibilityof stimulating trade by stipulating for its use in some government contracts for piece-goods.38. The pre-emptive purchase of wool has not materialised owingto the large increase in price due to exchange manipulation and tothe reduction in quantity now obtainable from 5,000 tons to 1,500 tens39-       Politically the Iranians are proving difficult, and have can-celled the credit granted them by His Majesty&apos;s Government of 5,000,000.     We have been unable to supply Iran with the type ofgoods she needs and friendship cools rapidly in the face of Germanenmity.AFGHANISTANhO.       The question of providing Afghanistan with assistance in.marketing wool and cotton in concert with the Government of india has also been examined.hi.       This may mean actual purchase by His Majesty&apos;s Government of wool, if not of cotton, as the Afghans are short .of funds and threat-ened with a crisis.      The political issues involved are of major importance and this Ministry strongly supports the case for immediate assistance.IV.CONTRABAND CONTROLk2.       Developments since the invasion of Denmark and Norway have greatly reduced the number of ships coming forward to Europe.      Inthe four weeks ended July 6th the Contraband Committee dealt with only 77 ships whereas before the transformation of the warj- theCommittee&apos;s weekly total of new ships dealt with often exceeded 100and on one occasion lh-5.     Contraband seized during the first threeweeks of this period totalled. 53,0M8 tons.2+3.       There has been a similar fall in the number of navicert appli-catioris, which amounted to 1,516-during the four weeks under -review,as compared with 3,552-in the week ending the 6th April.     The bulk iof the applications now received are for. Sweden, Finland, Spain and *&quot;Portugal.      In spite of Italy 1 s entry ,Vato the war, there has beena fall in the number of applications for Spain and Portugal.kk. Special/
1+I+.       Special efforts have been made to induce Spanish shipping lines and importers to insist upon navicerts for shipments to Spain.The navicert system was explained in detail to a representative ofAthe Spanish Government, who admitted thai this explanation corrected*many mistaken impressions of the way in which the system was operated.1+5.       Navicert applications have not been accepted in North andSouth America since June 10th for shipments to Switzerland and the balkan countries.     A new procedure has been evolved for the limitedissue of navicerts in Egypt for Bulgaria, Greece. Roumania and Yugo-slavia if the Governments concerned have previously obtained assur-ances of safe conduct from the Italian Government,1+6.       During the month, the navicert system has been introduced inEgypt and the Sudan, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador,Haiti, Nicaragua, Panama and Peru.     The other navicert issuingcountries are the United States, Argentine, Brazil, Uruguay andVenezuela,Action on Italy&apos;s Entry into the War1+7.       On italy s entry into the war, measures v/hich had been preparedbeforehand were immediately put into effect.     Vessels entering orleaving the Western Mediterranean were detained at Gibraltar,   Vesselsleaving the Mediterranean at Port Said were detained there.     Vesselsentering the Red Sea from the South were stopped at Aden.   neutral ships at United Kingdom, Colonial and Dominion ports with cargoesfor Mediterranean or Iberian ports were detained,     Navicerts were cancelled and applications refused for all European neutrals, otherthan Iceland, Sweden and Baltic States.     Export licences from UnitedKingdom Dominions and Colonies were refused for shipments to Europeanneutrals, excepting the countries mentioned above and Turkey, andconsignments of German deficiency goods for adjacent neutrals weredetained.     Italian vessels and their cargoes were seized.     Cargoesto or from Italy in neutral ships were detained, and after the issueof the Reprisals. Order-in-Council and the Contraband Proclamation,were placed in Prize and seized, respectively-.1+8.       Very soon a number of these restrictions were relaxed.   vessels were allowed to proceed to Portugal and Atlantic Spain, and even topass eastward through the Straits of Gibraltar provided that theywere bound for French or Spanish ports only.     The issue of navicertsand of export licences were permitted for the Iberian peninsula andthe issuing of navicerts for Turkey was renewed upon condition thatthe goods^ were not routed via Gibraltar,    &apos; Shippers were warned thatthe navicert gave no guarantee that a shipment would not be prevented from following routes e,g. the Red Sea route, where there was a riskof enemy action. ......1+9&apos;.       Japanese ships sailing towards the Mediterranean from the pacific have not been detained at Colonial ports east of Aden,      Inspite of- this there is as yet no sign of their making for italian east African ports.     One Japanese sfhip at Aden has unloaded its Med-iterranean cargo and set off to go&quot;round the Cape with the remainder of its European cargo.FRANCE&apos;50.     ; Contraband control j.s being applied to all goods shipped toFrance, whether destined for the occupied parts or hot, and no goods&amp;are being allowed to. poms in either part.     Authority is now being sought to apply, this decision (which is not yet. being announced inthe. case of the unoccupied territories.) to French Morocco, Algiersand Tunis/
and Tunis, &quot;but not yet to any French overseas possession.   &apos; Sincethe naval action at Oran, however,  ships proceeding to French ports in North Africa are being detained at Gibraltar.      French ships inBritish ports are being detained;    goods for France in ships whichtooie refuge voluntarily in United Kingdom ports are normally beingrequisitioned, while goods in ships diverted to British ports arebeing seized in Prize.V. ENEMY EXPORT CONTROL51.       Lord Justice du ParGq has resigned the Chairmanship of theEnemy Export Committee.     Lord Finlay will now combine the Chairman-ship with that of the Contraband Committee.52.       During the. four weeks ending 7th June, the Enemy ExportsCommittee reviewed 12&apos; ships, directing that goods he seized or placedin prize in 5 cases.     During&quot; the month the Committee considered h5applications for exemption, granting 19 and refusing 21:    in fivecases it was considered undesirable to take any decision.53.     . In connection.with a number of applications for exemptionreceived from certain.&apos;South American Governments, the committee decided that it was Impossible to grant any exemptions which.would cover consignments,leaving enemy ports.  ,       .5h.       The Committee Iras&apos;had under. consideration the question of enemy Export Control in the&quot; Iberian&apos;Peninsula in view of the inereas-ed importance of this channel;since TtalyVs entry into the war. . Itappears that there is little; effective control of exports -leavingItaly for the Americas via&apos; Spain and Portugal.     Possible methods,of improving the. control of this- traffic are being- considered,.- -55.     - The Committee considered a request from&apos; the Japanese Govern-rnent to&apos;.be-allowed&apos;,to ;carry 250,000&apos;to 300,000 tons of industrialsalt from Italian Soraaliland&apos;and Eritrea-.    \The Committee felt that,apart from the price&apos;.of: the salt-going&apos;to Italy, it was undesirable to depart from the practice.of not granting exemptions for goods tobe shipped from enemy ports.     As the Admiralty had also opposed -sheproject and there was information that alternative sources of supplywere probably available, the Committee considered that the request should not be granted.56.       The Committee considered the- question of valuable enemy,exports, such as semi-precious stones, removed by the authorities atBermuda from the American Clipper and, in view of the doubt whetherthe Reprisals Order-in-Gouhcil covered air-borne enemy exports,recommended that a.supplementary Order-in-Gouncil - should he made tocover such goods.
