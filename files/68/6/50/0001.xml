(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).SECRETT:.P. (R) (40) 170 copy N0Junej 1940.TZAR cabinet civil DEFENCE REPORT NO. 18.Eighteenth Report submitted &quot;by the,. Ministerpf Home Security, covering the: period from midnight 12th May, 1940, to Midnight,,&apos;.9thJune, 1940.(Previous Report: Paper No. W.P. (R) (40) 147)Enemy Air Attack. ^1.     The period   under review has seen the commencement of more systematic air&quot;attacks against this country.   Attacks had previously been restricted, apartfrom the Orkney and Shetland raids, to coastal activity by aircraft operating against shipping or engaged in reconnaissance or in minelaying.    On 22nd and25th May and 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th June bombs were dropped on land by enemy aircraft.   All raids took place at night.2.     The attacks of 22nd May and 3rd June affected single localities only andwere haphazard.   The raids of 25th May and 8th June, though limited, covered a wider area in Yorkshire and East Anglia, while on the nights of 5-6th Shd 6-7thJune a number of attacks were made by single planes or small units of enemy aircraft operating over a wide area from Southampton to the Tees, with a singleraid near Wick.    The attacks were aioparently directed partly againstindustrial establishments and partly against R.A.F. stations though in somecases these were missed by a wide margin.   Both high explosive and incendiary bombs were dropped and military objectives at Portsmouth, Southampton andNorthbourae were machine-gunned.3.     Civilian casualties due to enemy action numbered only soPfc ten injured.Two persons were killed and three injured when a British bomber crashed atAshlington, Northumberland.   Damage to civilian property was very slight.4.     The limited nature of the raids, and the fact that they have taken place at night, has meant that no great call has been made on civil defence personnelnor opportunity offered for observing any large scale pi&amp;f3d.o reaction.   StK&amp; duties as were needed appear everywhere to have been satisfactorily carried out, and civil Defence personnel where required turned out on the &apos;red&apos; warning atalmost full strength.    The public morale appears to have been good.     Sheltersof trench, surface and standard steel type have all proved highly successful in withstanding high explosive bombs at very close range.

- 2 -Air Raid Shelter,5c     A new Defence Regulation has been made requiring all householders inpossession of standard steel shelters to erect them and cover them adequatelyat once, failing which the shelters are to &quot;be collected hy the local authorities1and either re--issued to other eligible householders or stored for use against further contingencies.6. A pamphlet entitled &quot;Your Home as an Air Raid Shelter&quot; has been placed onsale for the guidance of those householders, not entitled to free provision of domestic shelter, v/ho have not yet taken any steps to provide for their ownprotection against splinters and flying glass. Attention is also drawn in thepamphlet to a scheme organised by the professional Institutions represented onthe Building Technical Advisory Committee for making the services of Consultantsavailable to householders on payment of a small fee.7.     A circular has been issued to local authorities setting out briefly a new method by which derelict buildings may be made to serve as shelters by demolishingthem just above the first floor level, and using the materials so obtained for thepurpose of adding to the lateral protection afforded by the external walls.This method will be particularly useful in congested areas where there is a deficiency of public or domestic shelter.   Buildings which may in the future bedamaged as a result of air raids could likewise be converted into shelters ofthis type.Control of Civil Defence Services.8.     In order to facilitate the effective operation of the Civil defence services and to ensure co-operation between Local Authorities, a defence regulation has been made conferring on the Civil Defence Departments expresspower to give directions to Local Authorities in relation to their civil defencefunctions.   The operational control of civil defence services in the Regions hasbeen delegated to the Regional commissioners.Holiday Camps.9.     By virtue of another new Defence Regulation, an Order has been madeprohibiting camping within 10 miles of the East and South-East coasts and inthe Isle of Wight and empowering   the police to prohibit camping elsewhere inthe vicinity of naval, military or air force establishments or vital factories.Greyhound Race Meetings.10.    In order to avoid any interference with working hours, arrangements have been made to limit afternoon greyhound race meetings to Saturdays, public holidays,- and Early Closing Days0Protection of persons living near aerodromes.,11.   Plans were put into operation on 27th May for a voluntary dispersal ofthe population from the neighbourhood of certain aerodromes, attacks uponwhich appeared to be imminent.   Householders living within 1000 yards of theseaerodromes were advised by the police to go to live with friends outside thisradius and preparations were made for billeting those who could not make private arrangements o The response to this invitation was in most cases very limited.12,   it was later decided not to extend the policy of dispersal and to followinstead a policy of providing protection on normal lines^   Steps are being takento encourage householders to provide their own shelter, while in areas where

there are concentrations of population facilities are &quot;being given for theprovision of shelters of the standard communal type.Evacuation.13.     The scheme for the evacuation of schoolchildren from vulnerable areas has &quot;been reviewed in the light of the situation created by the enemy occupation of Holland, Belgium and part of Northern Prance.    It was decidedthat a number of districts on the East and South East coasts ought nolonger to be used as reception areas and that arrangements should be made forthe early evacuation of school children from a number of towns on these coasts.14.     In pursuance of these decisions the following action has been taken:-(l) On 19th May, about 5,000 children from the London area andthe Medway towns, who had been evacuated at the outbreak of war to a number of East coast towns, were moved to South Hales.(2) On 2nd June about 7,000 more,children from the London area andthe Medway towns were moved to South Wales and the Midlands froma. number of other districts in the coastal belt from Norfolk-co ivento(3) On the same date about 39.Q00 children resident in a number of towns pn the East; Coa^t which have recently been classified asevacuation areas and in the Medway towns were moved to SouthWales and the Midlands,     Schools in the evacuated areas havebeen closed^15.     A campaign was also undertaken to stimulate registration in theevacuation areas in England,,   At the end of this campaign the number ofchildren registered was about one-fifth of the number estimated to remainin the evacuation areas; in the London area the number registered was about117,000 out of an estimated total,of 450,000.16.     It has been decided that the registered children in London should be evacuated forthwith, and arrangements have been made to put into operationthat portion of the railway timetables under the plans already prepared for london which is operated by the Great Western Railway and the South Y/esternbranch of the Southern Railway.   These timetables provide for the transportof approximately 130,000 children to the West of England and South Wales,,As announced on 9th June, evacuation of these children is to begin on Thursday,13th June and will be completed in six days.17,     In Scotland the number of children registered is approximately one-sixthof the number estimated to remain in the evacuation areas.   Some adjustments in both sending and receiving arrangements have been made.     No more children are to be sent to Montrose, Arbroath, Peterhead, or Praserburgh, and in viewof this loss of accommodation, and of the shortage of accommodation inreceiving areas generally, it has been decided to exclude from the schemecertain peripheral schools in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee.     These decisions have necessitated considerable changes in transport arrangements.   The new arrangements have been completed and are ready for operation.Hospital Services.IS.   Priority in labour and raw materials has been granted for the erection of a third block of huts in England and Wales to accommodate 8,000 beds, andit is planned to have these ready by October.    In addition, four hotels havebeen taken by the Ministry of Pensions and are being converted J&amp;&amp;-*atS5 &quot;ashospitals.    These will provide another thousand beds.19,   Plans are being mD.de for the rapid increase of casualty accommodation,if the need should arise, by the conversion of aohooA buildings, privatehouses, and other building into temporary hospitals by the introduction ofbeds and other necessary equipment.   Buildings which appear promising arebeing surveyed and, where appropriate, earmarked.    So far as possible beds

and other equipment are bein supplied   from the Ministry of Health&apos;s stocks,and further orders, especially for surgical instruments, are being placed.The increase of hospital facilities in other ways, ego by the addition of operating theatre equipment and medical supplies generally, has also beenaccelerated,,20.   Ih view of the large number of Service casualties received intoCivil Emergency Hospitals, arrangements have been made with the War office by which several hundred trained Army nurses are being lent for service in the  latterb    In addition nearly 3,000 mobile V.A.DS,, are being released from their Army obligations in order to enable them to join the CivilNursing Reserve,21,   In the Reserve itself, all mobile whole-time members not already employed have been put in regional pools available for appointment to anycasualty hospital in the region, in the first instance, or, if need requires,elsewhere in England and T7al.es.   Twelve months&apos; continuous employment   after being called up for whole-time hospital service has been guaranteed to suohmembers up to a maximum cD-sahlishmeaxi; of 30,000 (10,000 trained and assistantnurses, and 29,000 nursing auxiliaries)e22.    Further recruits to the Reserve are coming forward as quickly as theycan be absorbed.-Contamination of Milk, Food or Water.23.   Arrangements have been made for taking immediate action in the event ofsuspicion of deliberate aon&amp;amSnati-on   of foodstuffs j and memoranda have beenissued to the Regional Medical Officers on the poisoning of public water supplies by arsenic, and on the action to be taken by Medical Officers ofHealth on the occurrence of a case of enteric fever or other infection ofalimentary origin.Railways.24.    The arrangements made b&quot; the railways for the transport of 5,000 Londonchildren from the Essex and Kent Coasts on Sunday 19th May and 48,000 children from East Anglian and Kent Coast towns on Sunday 2nd June and also for thetransport of the B.E.F. and Allied troops from disembarkation points duringthe period 27th May - 5th June worked smoothly.   These movements caused no serious interference with other rail services, although they necessitated somesuspensions of passenger services on certain routes025.   To offset the reduction in coastwise shipments of coal from North east coast ports to London and the South, f following the withdrawal of vessels fromthis service, 19 coal trains per week have been added to the special programmereferred to in earlier reports0   The number of special coal trains now runningto the South from Northumberland and Durham is 146 per week, and from theMidlands 43 per weekoDockg   and Harbours.269   Conditions at the ports are generally satisfactory although certain portshave been temporarily unapproachable owing to mines.270    On 28th May, the Port Emergency Committees were advised that diversionsof shipping might be expeoted generally and were instructed to bring intoeffect all steps indicated in previous agreed instructions to keep the quaysand transit sheds clearc   As a precautionary measure some diversion of shipping from London and East Coast ports is being carried outre

MINISTRY OF HOME SECURITY,HOME OFFICE,WHITEHALL.15th June, 1940.Rqad Transport.28.   The demands of the Army for the use of public service vehicles have at times in certain areas put a considerable strain on the available resources;   There has been however, no important interference with publicservioes.29,   Further demands for goods vehicles for the use of both the Army andthe Air Force have been met without difficulty.Alternative Accommodation for Government Staffs.50.   During the period under review arrangements have been made to movea further 2,500 Civil Servants to plaoes outside Londoni about half this number have already gone out and the remainder will follow during the next ten days.Public Order and Morale.51*   The conduct and morale of the public during air raids have been good,and there has been no panic.   On the whole members of the public have kept under cover, and the chief criticism, which comes from several chief constables, is that when the red warning has been sounded some people have switched on lights before obscuring their windows.32.   Public sentiment against the anti-war organisations and enemy alienshas continued to harden, and the measures recently taken .to deal with enemy aliens and British sub jects suspected of Fifth Column aotirltiesare generally approved.   There have been hcstlle demonstrations at communists and other anti-war meetings, and street sellers of Communist, Fascist and   .Pacifist publications have been threatened and attacked. There has been marked decline in the activities of all of these organisations.35.   Many reports of suspected espionage and Fifth Column aotivites, andof suspcious incidents such as alleged parachute landings, have reachedthe police.   Most of them have, proved, gromdless.J.A,
