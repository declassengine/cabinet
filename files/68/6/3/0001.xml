MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC WARFARiyookly Rencrt on Action Taken for the period april 1 ?th- 14-th,----. - -......-    - -       --19407War Trade Agreements and Reiations with. Ne\itral States.The week was overshadowed by the events in norway and Denmark, which will clearly have a profound effect on .the work of the Ministry,,     &quot;while the work of the navalpatrols will doubtless be facilitated provided the enemydoes not obtain command of the western coast of Norway,  thebooty obtained from Denmark and to a lesser extent from Norwaywill,  in the short run at least,  cause a heavy setback inthe pressure of the blockade on Germany.2. Meanwhile negotiations for rationing agreements with Yugoslavia and Hungary have continued, and a satisfactory agreement with the Yugoslav National Bank was signed on the15tli April.    Negotiations with the Roumanian Delegation will-begin shortly.    Useful progress has been made in thediscussions between the French and United Kingdom Governmentsof arrangements to limit exports of ferro-alloys from theU.S.A. to dangerous destinations in the Far East,  and fullinstructions have been issued to Mr.fu2*vis.3&apos; The position in individual countries is asfollowsScandinavian and Baltic Countries4. The German invasion of Denmark and Norway hasentirely   altered the economic war in   Scandinavia and theBaltic,       The War Trade Agreement with Denmark had only been signed on the 2nd April and Mr.Buckley of this Ministryleft for Copenhagen on the 8th April to arrange the firstmeeting of the Standing Committee.    It is understood that heescaped a meeting with the German Army. The War trade agreement with Norway had been signed on the14th March and the first meeting of theJoint/

joint Commission was just concluded (in a very satisfactoryatmosphere) before the invasion.s.       On Denmark accepting German protection it was necessaryto treat her as territory under German occupation or control.Instructions were therefore issued that all Danish ships andtheir cargoes and all contraband consigned to or destined forDenmark should be detained or seised,  that all goods of Danishorigin or ownership on neutral ships which left their las&apos;tDanish or Norwegian port on or after 9th April should be detained under the Reprisals Order-in-Council,  that allapplications for navicerts covering goods consigned to Danishdestinations should be refused and that all navicerts alreadygranted should be cancelled.    (These instructions do not applyto Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands.)6.       In addition, instructions were sent to His Majesty&apos;representatives in countries with which War Trade agreements have been concluded to inform the Governments concerned thatDenmark should now be regarded as assimilated to enemy terri-tory for the purpose qf such agreements.   All goods subject toa prohibition against export tp Germany should equally besubject to a prohibition against export to Denmark.   As regardsgoods on the normal trade list or on a list restricting exportsto Germany to specified quantities, the assimilation of Denmarkto Germany could not imply that the normal quantities previouslyexported to Denmark could now be added to the quantitiesexportable to Germany under the agreement.    Instructions inthe foregoing sense were sent to His Majesty&apos;s representatives at Stockholm, Brussels, The Hague, Angora and Athens.7.       So far as the Scandinavian and Baltic States are concerned,instructions were issued that until further notice(l) no further export licences would be granted for such countries, and consignments for which export licences hadalready been granted would not be allowed to proceed,(2) Navicerts already issued would remain in fore,   but not/ensure

ensure passage through the contraband control; the issue of fresh navicerts was suspended.(3)    In all U.K. ports and bases all neutral ships wouldbe prevented for the time being from sailing for anyScandinavian or Baltic or North Russian destination.      Thepatrols in the Channel and the North were instructed to bring in all ships and to ignore any ships&apos; navicerts or &quot;MissingKirlcv/all&quot; clearances.(li)    Swedish,,Finnish;, Latvian and Estonian ships bound forScandinavian or Baltic destinations were to be detained inBritish colonial and overseas ports.3. In order to keep Norwegian sni]:.s out of neutral portswhere they might fall under the control of the puppet norwegian government, Norwegian ships were to be detained and brought inall over the world.9. Instructions have ales been sent to II.M.Consul-general at Reykjavik to inform the Anglo-Icelandic Joint commission that no shipments should be made to Norwegian territory under german occupation or ta any Swedish or Baltic destinationuntil further notice.1k,       Prom the 12th April cargo for Holland and from the 13thApril cargo for Belgium has, with certain exceptions, been detained for &quot;further examination&quot;, with the incidental thoughintended consequence of detaining the carrying ships as well,SWITZERLAND11. Two members of this Ministry are proceeding to Berne todiscuss outstanding points in the War Trade negotiations withthe Swiss authorities.&apos;   ITALY12.       Negotiations for a new clearing agreement are still proceeding in Rome.13.       Italian imports of petroleum are giving cause for anxietyalthough/

-k-aIthough there is as yet no evidence of any large-scaleleakage to Germany.    Hitherto such imports have as a general rule been allowed to pass through the contraband controlswithout delay, in return for an official undertaking inrespect of each cargo that it was entirely for domestic consumption.    It has now been ascertained that considerableexport contracts have been sanctioned by the same authority as has been giving us guarantees against exportation; and steps to deal with this breach of faith are under consideration.Hi.. The Italian press has protested vigorously against our alleged intention to exercise contraband control in the adriatic over German ships trading between Yugoslavia andTrieste.     Although our right to exercise such control isindisputable, we have so far neither exercised it nor expressedour intention to do so; and some ulterior motive is thereforesuspected.Hungary.15. Negotiations in regard to import &quot;rations&quot; arenearing completion. Rations now declared closed includecopper, lead, cottnn, nickel, borax, tin, lubricating oil,rosin, carbon black.Roumania.16.    Tne first meeting was held with the RoumanianDelegation at the Ministry of Economic Warfare on April 12th,when, in response to the Roumanian request that we shouldfacilitate the supply to them of their requirements of anumber of raw materials, they were handed the draft of a rationing Agreement as a basis of negotiation.    Althoughthe Roumanian Delegation did not commit themselves on anumber of points in the draft, they seemed disposed toconsider an arrangement of this kind, and detailed discussions on the quotas will begin within a few days.Yugoslavia/

YUGOSLAVIA.A Rationing Agreement with Yugoslavia was signed by theMinister of Economic Warfare and Dr.Belin, Vice-Governor of the yugoslav Rational Bank on April 15th.      The agreement providesthat H.M.G. will facilitate the passage through the contraband control of a number of raw materials up to quantities to be agreedupon quarterly in advance.      The quotas for the first quarterof the agreement have been fixed and will operate retrospectivelyas from April 1st.      In addition to agreeing to these quotas,the Yugoslav Government have given a number of assurances, ofwhich the following are the most important.1(a)     The export from Yugoslavia to any destination in Europe offany of the goods to which the agreement applies, or of the] products manufactured therefrom will, except in the case ofcertain woollen goods, leather goods and tin goods, be prohibited.Exports of these three categories of goods -will, however, belimited to the same figure as in 1939.(b) The export of oilseeds, other than soya, is prohibited until september, 19hO, the export of soya beans to Germany during thepresent year being limited to 6,000 tons.(c) Although they receive a small quota for petroleum products from overseas sources, the Yugoslav Government have agreed to take as much of their requirements as possible from Roumania, and wehave offered to help them in this respect as far as possible.18, It was agreed that there should be no public reference tothe conclusion of the Agreement.U.:S. A.___: and S ou t h - Am erica.19. The approval of the Anglo-French Co-ordinating Committeehas been obtained for instructions to Mr. Purvis for his discussions about the reinforcement of the &quot;moral embargo&quot; by limiting exportsof molybednum, wolfram, chrome and nickel./It

It was decided that Mr.Purvis should continue his discussions with the molybdenum producers and that he should approach theU.SoGovernment with a view to stopping the re-export of theother metals,20. Further discussions have taken place with theBritish and American Phosphate Producers with a view to obtaining their support for a phosphate producer sellingagreement on the lines of that already obtained from theQuebracho producers.21. Information lately received from South Americaseems to show that sentiment there continues to be pro-Ally.While in some countries and in Bolivia in particular, there appears to be a lack of adequate facilities for distributingAllied; news, there are signs of a tendency for nativeLatin American firms to sever their trade connections withfirms which we have included on our Statutory List.    InBolivia again it Is to be noted that Don Simon Patino,the tin magnate, has given orders to his banks to stop the granting of credits to German concerns, and to his minesnot to buy any of their requirements from German sources.CONTRABAND CONTROL.22. During the week ending 13th April 72 new casesof ships were dealt with. In 4-3 cases advance copies ofmanifests of cargoes were received and considered beforethe ships arrival at ports in this country and in 10 suchcases the ships concerned were released by the Committeesubject merely to the formalchecking of the originalmanifests on their arrival at the Control Bases. 45 ships were allowed to carry forward cargo under Hold-backGuarantees.ENEMY EXPORTS.23* The Committee met six times this week.    Itreviewed 12 ships, detaining 5 for enquiries or onaccount of new developments in the international situation,ordering items of cargo from 1 to be discharged and placed inPrize/...

Totalapplications to date number 45s726 of which 36,394 have beengranted.    During the week 12 fully navicerted ships cameforward including one with a Ships&apos;  Navicert.ACRE - ;MEITTS-WITH SHIPPING^ EIBMS .An arrangement has been arrived at with the United StatesLines covering four of their ships which sail from Antwerp underthe 3elgian flag.    In return for permission being given forthe ships to be examined for enemy exports at Le Havre orSouthampton instead of in the Downs, the U.S. Lines promise to carry no passengers, mails or uncertificated cargo,  to supplyadvance manifests and advance information, of sailing.GENERAL PRIZE QUESTIONS.The extensive contraband control measiires required by events in Scandinavia have already been summarised in paragraphsfour to ten above.The Contraband Committee has, for the second time andwith some reluctance, in view of the.continued failure of theAmerican Red Cross authorities to cornpLy with conditions ofwhich they were informed over three months ago, agreed to permit the passage of a quantity of Red Cross Supplies for relief/purposes

purposes in Poland.     The supplies are to a value of2.r:0,000 U.S. dollars of which 100,000 dollars&apos; worthconsists of medical supplies including some condensed milk, and the rest consists mainly of clothing.
