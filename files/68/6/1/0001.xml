MONTHLY REPORT (NO.8) BY THE AIR ministry on SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION.MARCH. 1940.Aircraft.The output of aircraft in this country during the monthof March, 1940, was 860 - the planned output was 928 - and,, inaddition, 116 aircraft were delivered from the United States.    Thisoutput is &quot;below the planned delivery but the difference arose fromthe decision.which may well be in the ultimate interests of pro-duction, that the aircraft industry, in common with the rest of theengineering industry, should take an Easter holiday of the normallength.2.&apos;.    Orders for aircraft placed since the outbreak of war nowamount to a total of 20,100 in this country, 310 in Canada, and1,320 in the United States, at an estimated aggregate cost of  445million.    These figures are exclusive of the further orders in theU.S.A. which the Supreme War Council has decided should be placedon behalf of the two Governments with a view to building up an aircraft production potential in America.    The share of the UnitedKingdom in these orders for delivery between September 1940 and september 1941 is likely to amount to 2,440 aircraft (including aircraft taken as spares) at a cost of about  77 million.3.     During March,, capital expenditure by the Air Ministry ofapproximately  730,000 was approved to increase the productivecapacity of aircraft constructors.    The most important of the schemeswas for the establishment of an organisation under the management of the De Havilland Aircraft Company to assemble Halifax (bomber)aircraft in a new factory at Watford which will be provided by theAir Ministry at a cost of about  457,000.    The aircraft componentswill be manufactured in the London Passenger Transport Board depot at Aldenham, to which certain alterations and additions will bemade at a cost of about  89,000, and in the Alliance aircraft factory, Western Avenue, which is being renovated and adapted at a cost of about  50,000.

4..-    Extensions to the capacity of a number of sub-contractorsinaking aircraft components were approved for provision at AirMinistry expense at an aggregate cost of about  480,000,    The moreimportant are as follows:-   -(a) British Thomson-Houston Company will manufacture componentsof Wellington (bomber) aircraft for assembly in the new factory at Blackpool to be managed by Vickers-ArmstrongsLtd.:   For this purpose Celta Mills, Fletton, Peterborough,will be hired by the Department,, adapted at a cost of- 21,000, and provided with plant costing approximately 60,000.(b) Rubery Owen Messier Ltd., making undercarriages forHalifax (bomber) aircraft, will be provided with buildings and plant at Warrington at a cost of approximately 114,000 and at Wolverhampton at a cost of approximately 49,000*    Automotive Products Ltdc, making undercarriagesfor a number of types of aircraft, will le provided with 164,000 worth of additional plant,.5.      As a contribution to the training of labour in adequatenumbers it is desirable that aircraft firms should themselvesestablish schools for the purpose which, in order to interfere as little as possible with current production, should be separate from&apos;   &apos;:    I.     .their works.    Several such schemes are under consideration and during March the Fairey Aviation Company were authorised to establish a training school in the John England Works, Wembley.Engines.68      Capital expenditure of the order of  450,000 was approvedto increase capacity for the production of aero-engines and parts,Hand engine accessories.    This sum includes provision for a new shopat Filton to accommodate development and initial production work on new and modified types of exhaust rings for Bristol enginesP( i%000)f additional onal storage accommodation and assembly space forthe No.1 Engine Shadow Group,  ( 19,000), and the provision of new

- 3nluildings and plant at a cost of about  310,000 to increase theIroduction of airscrews by the Rotol Company.Equipment.7.     Further extensions of capacity have been necessary to insure that the output ..of the numerous instruments and other equip-ment used in aircraft keeps pace with the production of aircraft and engines.    These requirements are necessarily of a very miscell-Carbonaceous character but capital expenditure authorised during the monthan this account amounted to approximately  100,000.Armament.8.     Luring March a complete review of bomb requirements andjjoductive capacity was undertaken.    Decisions were reached onportant questions of policy with regard to the use of various types of bomb and the rates of production required, and long term contracts (subject to a break clause) are being placed to ensure thatmanufacturers are kept fully employed within the limits of theprogramme.I     9.     Two measures approved for increasing the capacity forarmament production and repair should be mentioned:. -(a) The Daimler Company are being provided with new plant foruse in part at their factory at Birtley, Northumberland,at a cost of approximately  175,000, for an additionalmonthly production of 130 gun turrets of Fraser Nashtypeso(b) An expenditure of approximately  6,300 was approved forthe adaptation of buildings and the purchase of plant toprovide for the repair of 1,000 Browning guns a month by the B.S.A. Company,Ijw materials.10.     Light Alloys and Magnesium.    The purchase of two additionalBOOG ton extrusion presses was authorised during March to increase .IIN production of small light alloy extrusions.    These complete therf^cilities required to meet the present needs of the war programme.

11.     A review was undertaken of present policy with regard toi) the use of magnesium in aircraft,  (b) the requirements ofmagnesium for the present aircraft and bomb programmes and (c) the[situation with regard to the production and supply of magnesium.t is evident that considerable extensions to productive capacityiyill be necessary.    First steps taken include an increase in the productive capacity of Murex Ltd. by upwards of 1,000 tons a year,lit a cost of about  85,000 for additional plant, and an increasen the capacity of Magnesium Electron Ltd. by 5,000 tons a year at la cost of about  574,000 for new buildings and plant.    A further,000 tons of magnesium metal will be required from the United states to increase Air Ministry reserves.    The Ministry of Supply have beenasked to ensure that the supply of raw magnesite, which is imported,and of magnesia, which is manufactured in this country from dolomitefend sea water, is increased to provide materials for this increased&quot;production of magnesium metal.12.     Steel tubes.    The position with regard to the supply ofsteel tubes for aircraft is such that it will be necessary to double the productive capacity of the country in order to provideat least 4 million feet of steel tubing of aircraft quality perjfionth for the war programme.    Expansions of productive capacity,josting approximately  2 million, are under consideration by thelinistry of Supply.13.     Timber.    Air Ministry requirements of spruce for aircraftinufacture amount to 6,250 standards during the first year of warand 11,200 standards during the second year.    It appears probablethat 5,000 standards of spruce of aircraft quality (one seventh ofthe total output) will be obtained from Canada during this year..Che Timber Controller of the Ministry of supply hopes to obtainphe balance of requirements from the United States.14. Cottono The Ministry of Supply have been asked to make arrangements to purchase the whole of the 1941 crop of Sea Island^cotton, estimated to amount to 5,000 bales., which it is expected

gl.ll be required for the production of balloon fabric.Summary.15.     Aircraft.(a) The output of aircraft in this country during March was860 as compared with the planned output of 928;    inaddition 116 aircraft were delivered from the UnitedStates (paragraph 1).(b) Since the outbreak of war 20,100 aircraft have been ordered in this country, 310 in Canada and 1,320 inthe United States;    and it has been decided to order afurther 2,440 in the U.S.A.  (paragraph 2).(c) Further measures have been taken to increase productivecapacity (paragraphs 3-5)*16,     Engines and Equipment,    Further increases of capacityhave been approved (paragraphs 6 and 7 respectively).17.     Armament.    Bomb requirements and productive capacityre reviewed, and additional capacity for producing Fraser Nashturrets and for repairing Browning guns was authorisedaragraphs 8 and 9),18.      Raw materials.    Estimated requirements and supplies ofgnesium, steel tubes and timber were reviewed during the month,,p additional extrusion presses have been ordered.    The MinistrySupply have been asked to purchase the 1941 crop of Sea IslandItton for balloon fabric (paragraphs 10 - 14).
