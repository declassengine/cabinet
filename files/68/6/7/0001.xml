Output generally was again adversely affected during the month owing to the dislocation of supplies of materials, &amp;c, arising from the severe weather conditions during January and february. The stoppage of work for the Easter Flolidays is also reflected in the delivery figuresduring the period covered by the report, the temporary reduction in output being in many casesout of all proportion to the nominal holiday period.Gun Ammunition.2. The production of shell is still disappointing, although it must be pointed out that nopost-war planning has yet become effective. Generally speaking, the anticipated increase under war conditions on the older plants has not been realised. There is also at present a shortage oiammunition components due to the difficulty in bringing into operation new sources of production.It is hoped that these difficulties will be overcome in the near future.Artillery Equipment.3. Deliveries of the new 25-pdr. carriage from two works have now been made. 24 havebeen delivered to inspection, of which 20 have been accepted to date.Anti-Aircraft.4.   Deliveries of 3-7-inch guns to inspection have now passed 1,000.5. 40-mm. anti-aircraft equipments are now proceeding according to the amended forecast of production.6.   7 heightfinders came from France.7.   22 predictors came from U.S.A.8. There was a falling off in deliveries of fuze setters, no deliveries having been made from switzerland during the month.S.A. Ammunition.9. 10,000,000 rounds of -303-inch S.A.A. came from India, and a considerable quantity is in transit.
Explosives and Chemical Supplies.10. The production of cordite and tetryl, which was down owing to the Waltham Abbeyexplosion, is now getting back to normal.11. The production of T.N.T. is the largest since the outbreak of war. The delivery figureof 2.353 short tons includes 285 tons from Canada.12.   The contract for Ammonal (Commercial No. 704) has now been completed.Tanks.13. With the exception of light tanks, there was an increase in production of all types of tanks. The spares position for armoured fighting vehicles, however, is unsatisfactory, owing toarrears in peace time and the rival claims for rapid expansion of complete vehicle production.14. Deliveries of light tanks continued low owing to the approaching completion of Mark VI.It is unlikely that the delivery rate will increase until Mark VII comes into production.15. New contractors have come into production, and deliveries of cruiser tanks and carriershave shown a substantial increase.10. Three more erectors have still to come into production, after which deliveries of infantrytanks will further increase.Wheeled Vehicles.17. In general, the output of wheeled vehicles in March was below expectation, the maincause being difficulty in obtaining raw materials, which is beginning to become acute, whilst,delivery of raw materials was affected by rail transport difficulties. The Easter holidays causedsome disorganisation over and above the actual days lost. Regular shipments of wheeled vehiclesare being received from overseas for repair, 600 having arrived to date. The position with regardtn spares is generally satisfactory.18. The deliveries of 30-cwt. 6-wheeled lorries, although short of forecast, were materiallyabove the previous month&apos;s deliveries. Special difficulty has been experienced in securingmaterial by the sole firm (M.C.C.) producing all models.19. One manufacturer (Humber) failed to start production on wireless models; otherwise8-cwt. 4-whe.eled trucks would have fulfilled the forecast of 1.275.Engineer Stores.20. There was a general increase in deliveries of engineer stores as a result of improvedweather, better raw material deliveries and less sickness.21. Although there was an increase in the. deliveries of assault boats, there has still beendelay in the supply of canvas.Signal Stores.22. Deliveries of Wireless Sets No. 9 from new contractors started in March, and steadyincreases are expected.23. Initial difficulties having been overcome, production of the new Wireless Set No. 14started in March.24. Deliveries of fullerphones in February (a five-week period) were abnormal, and the figure for March, which included the Easter holidays, was still ahead of the forecast25. The. decline in deliveries of Switchboards U.C. 6 and 10-line was due to the concentra-tion of production on the latter, the number of which increased from 266 in February to 402in March.26.   The increase in the deliveries of quad cables was due to a large accumulation awaitinginspection which was passed during the month.Transportation Equipmeni.27. Considerable quantities of permanent way material and shunting locomotives have been delivered, but no large deliveries of rolling-stock for main-line working have yet been made. Toprevent their passing to German hands, arrangements have been made with France for thepurchase of 600 40-ton all-steel wagons built in Belgium for the Chinese railways. arrangements have also been made to purchase in Belgium 3,000 20-ton open wagons for the French, in orderto absorb Belgian capacity.Anti-Gas Stores.28. Respirator containers, type E., Mark VI, are now in production. This type gives the combined protection previously afforded by type E., Mark V, in conjunction with type E.A. Thelatter is. therefore, now obsolescent, and orders have almost been completed.Clothing and Equipment Stores.29. Deliveries of general stores as a whole show a slight increase over February. Rawmaterials continue to be a difficulty. As a result of delays in inspection due to the Easterholidays, the figures underestimate production.Special &quot; over the counter &quot; purchases of small hand tools had to be made for troopsgoing abroad.30. A continuance of the present rale of production of worsted socks, ankle boots, blousesand helmets would enable requirements by Z -f- 12 to be met. A similar jiosition as regards therate of production of trousers should be reached in May and as regards that of hold-alls andhousewives in April. Despite the increase during March, the rate of production of web equipment is still below that required.31. The increased output of cellular drawers is due to the purchase of fabric from India;a further increase is anticipated.32. The fall in the deliveries of mess tins is due to the change over to tinned steel, theproduction of which is now coming forward.

Raw Materials.The rate of shipping of a number of raw materials continued to fall belowneeds, and a number of blast furnaces will have to be closed down in the nearfuture if shipments of ore do not improve. As a result of a close scrutiny of theimmediate requirements some reduction of the requirements for shipping rawmaterials was agreed on as a temporary measure. A large part of the reduction was obtained by a prospective further inroad on stocks.Iron and Steel.A new scheme for controlling the distribution of iron and steel, based on theallocation made by the Central Priority Committee, has been approved by that committee and came into operation on the 1st April. A definite allocation willbe made for each quarterly period to each Department or group of Departments,and each Department will be responsible for issuing its certificates authorisingcontractors or industries for which it is responsible to purchase steel within theirallocation.The production of iron and steel, which had suffered a set-back during thewinter owing largely to climatic conditions, has now regained the level reached in October and November last; home ore production now shows a substantial increase.Treasury approval has been obtained for schemes for the development ofspecial steel tube capacity to meet Air Ministry requirements. Proposals are under examination for increased production of pig iron and also for increasing-alloy steel capacity for making gun forgings.Ferro-A Hoys and Materials therefor.There has been a rapid growth in demand for vanadium, and departments have been asked to economise in its use. World supplies of raw material are limited, and, of those available, some are difficult in treatment. The agreementwith the Rhokana Corporation for the maintenance of a stock of cobalt metal,which expires at the 30th April, is to be renewed for a further year. The Frenchand British Governments have agreed to guarantee the purchase of 10 million lb.of molybdenum metal from the Climax Co. of America.Copper, Lead and Zinc.Supplies have continued to arrive in adequate quantities. The Control is taking further active steps to reduce consumption for less essential purposes.In view of the shipping position it is proposed to reduce imports of lead byabout 3,000 tons per month over the next few months. A Deputy Controller hasnow been formally appointed to deal with the brass position, particularly inregard to the utilisation of productive capacity to the best advantage.
A luminium.The Air Ministry have made revised estimates of their requirements of virginaluminium for 1940 and 1941. The arrangements made for production in thiscountry and purchase abroad should ensure that the requirements will be metfor these years, subject to there being no disturbance of existing sources of supply,e.g., Norway. The requirements for 1942 present greater difficulty and the means for meeting them are at present under consideration.A ntirnony.The English and French smelters have come to an agreement to co-operate inthe purchase and shipment of ores and metal in order that the available materialmay be equitably shared and prices maintained at reasonable levels. Returnsobtained from home smelters indicate an increase in demand since the outbreakof war.Regular and A cid Sulphur.The Italians have raised the price of sulphur by about 75 per cent., and ithas been decided to discontinue purchase from them. The Fi&apos;ench are more favourably situated to buy owing to their lower freights, and it has been agreedthat they shall make an additional purchase in Italy to prevent the material fromgoing to Germany. For the time being, therefore, the United Kingdom must look to the United States for the balance of her requirements.Inorganic Fertilisers.Deliveries for the present season are proceeding satisfactorily and are higherthan at the corresponding date last year. The supply position of phosphaterock is improving, although, owing to delayed arrivals and one loss due to enemy action, it has been necessary to make further releases from Government reserve to keep production going.Bichromates of Soda and Potash and their Derivatives.Owing to the heavy demand for these chemicals, schemes for global allocations to the principal consuming trades, i.e., the woollen, cotton and dyeing, leatherand colour trades, have been formulated in conjunction with the Export Counciland other interested Government Departments, Ministry of Supply Controls, thebichromate manufacturers, and, in the case of colours, the appropriate trade associations.Timber.In spite of efforts to secure economy, the consumption of softwoods continuesto exceed the quantity for which shipping space can be provided. Reviseddepartmental requirements for the second half of this year are now being obtained, and it seems likely that allocations for this period may have to bereduced below the present level.By making all possible use of home-grown, French and Portuguese miningtimber and substituting steel wherever possible, the requirement for pitpropsfrom Canada has been reduced to 300,000 standards. It is essential that this quantity should be shipped during open water if the mines are to be kept going.Although supplies of hardwoods are not too plentiful, the situation in thepast has not been so serious as in the case of softwoods. Owing, however, to increasing requirements and the diversion of demand from softwoods, the demand on hardwood stocks is increasing. The Joint Production and Materials PrioritySub-Committee has, therefore, decided to extend the departmental allocationprocedure already adopted for softwoods to all varieties of hardwood.Flax..A new schedule of maximum prices for dry spun flax yarns has been issued;the profit margins involved in the prices originally proposed by the spinners inthis connexion have been reduced by 25 per cent., pending the result of a costingsinvestigation which the Ministry are about to undertake. With a view tostimulating production of unretted flax in areas of Northern Ireland whereretting facilities are lacking, an offer has been made to the Northern IrelandMinistry of Agriculture of guaranteed prices for &quot;green fibre.&quot;
Reception Depots.Salvage.Military Side.Constructional work has begun on No. 1 Depot at Lydney. Progress hasbeen made with plans and tenders for No. 2 Depot at Steventon.France.The branch for disposals in France was opened at 6 Rue de Lisbonne, Paris,and sales of tins are proceeding.Civilian Side.Schemes by Local Authorities.&quot;Positive&quot; returns for February were received from over 550 Councilsrepresenting a population of 32 millions; the sales were over  42,000 (November 29,000).   A number of additional schemes were started during March.Some increase has been made in the monthly amount of Belgian flax whichis being purchased in collaboration with the French, without disturbing the price level to any noticeable extent, A vessel carrying some 400 tons of Belgian flax tothis country has recently been lost.// emp.The general supply position continues to be satisfactory, although difficulties have recently been experienced concerning Central European hemp; these mattershave formed the subject of discussions with the Hungarian and Jugoslav TradeDelegations.Paper and Paper-making Materials.The re-issue prices of pulp for paper-making have been increased and, inorder to avoid undue profits on stocks in the hands of the mills, a charge hasbeen levied on the stocks by a Treasury Order. The re-issue prices of pulp are,however, still below the costs of importation. An Order has been made increasingtihe prices of paper to correspond with the increased prices of paper-making materials. An Order has also been made increasing the prices payable for wastepaper, rags, &amp;c, to stimulate their collection.Supplies of wood pulp have been short owing to adverse weather conditionsin the Baltic.  Steps have been taken to increase supplies of esparto.Hides, Skins and Tanning Materials.Imports of hides and skins during February were the highest for any monthof the war, and the supplies of native hides have shown some improvement.Stocks of most tanning materials have been maintained, but there is some anxiety about chestnut extract and myrobalans. The Leather Control is now allocatingbichromates to tanners and it is hoped that this will remove past difficulties.Leather is moving smoothly through the reserved stocks to Service and exportneeds.Rubber.The pronounced fall in stocks which took place in January and Februaryhas now been arrested. At present stocks in the United Kingdom amount torather over three months&apos; consumption. The quantity of rubber afloat to theUnited Kingdom is satisfactory. Several of the leading rubber manufacturershave agreed to increase their stocks and their forward orders so as to ensure a steady flow of rubber to this country. This policy should result in an increase of stocks to between four and five months&apos; consumption and in their maintenance atthat level.Cotton.There are now ample supplies of cotton, amounting to over six months&apos; con-sumption. Plans for maintaining adequate supplies, while reducing the dollarcommitments, are under consideration.The revision of the fixed yarn prices to cover the increase of wages the cottonlevy, &amp;c, is under consideration.
Publicity.Publicity was continued by local conferences, broadcasts, press interviews,and films.Schools.The Board of Education have agreed to recommend to Local EducationAuthorities (about 20,000 schools) the instruction of school children in anti-wasteand salvage, and the collection by them of certain materials.Pig Feed.Circulars have been issued in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculturewith recommendations for collection of waste food for pig and poultry feedingto meet local demands.Industrial Salvage.A preliminary survey of the field of possible salvage in various industrieshas been made in conjunction with the Department of Scientific and industrial research and the Federation of British Industries. Proposals for regeneratingused lubricating oils are being drawn up by the Petroleum Board.V. Priority.Production and Materials (Joint) Priority Sub-Committees.Two meetings were held and the supply and demand position of thefollowing raw materials was discussed : (a) Timber.(6) Steel.The matters discussed and the conclusions reached are referred to under IV RawMaterials.Sub-Committee on Economy in the Use of Timber.The Sub-Committee has continued its investigations and will shortly beissuing a second interim report in which details of further substantial savings in imported softwoods will be given.Sub-Committee on the Requirements-&apos;of Metal Boxes.The Sub-Committee has held ten meetings and has examined a considerablenumber of trades who are large users of tinplate. Progress has been made ineffecting economies by standardisation and the elimination of containers ofextravagant size and shape for the period of the war. The Sub-Committee&apos;activities are continuing.VI. Area Organisation.During the month much progress has been made in setting up the AreaOrganisation. Eleven Area Boards are now complete. A Secretary for the area board for Scotland has now been selected, and a recommendation for the repre-sentative of the Air Ministry on the North Midland Board is now before theSecretary of State for Air.Of the twenty-three Area Advisory Committees fifteen have now been set up,including the eleven Committees on the first or more urgent list.The nominations for the remainder are expected soon to be complete. It isearly to predict how the Committees will function, but it has been found necessaryto take special steps to give them something concrete upon which to work. So far the brunt of this has been borne by the Ministry of Supply, which has provided the Committees with lists of requirements for&apos; which they have been asked torecommend manufacturers. The Admiralty and Air Ministry are being askedto take similar action.Steps have been taken to secure the services of &apos;&apos; Progress &apos;&apos; Officers, who will advise in respect of dilution.   So far three of these Officers have been appointed
and have been sent to Woolwich to study for a few days the most up-to-datemethods of armament production. They&quot; will then, be appointed to particular areas.  Five others have been selected for appointment.VII. Labour.The labour situation is causing some apprehension, both as regards construc-tion of factories and the manufacture of munitions and in Government works aswell as the works of contractors.Construction.In South Lancashire there is a shortage of about 5,000 bricklayers, andfactory construction is not going so rapidly as desired; it may be necessary to ask that A.R.P. construction, particularly in Liverpool, should be retarded in orderto release additional bricklayers for factory construction. There is a shortageof bricklayers in South Wales also, where some 3,000 are needed. It is hoped tosecure a greater measure of transference of labour through the working of agree-ments relating to transference, but the only pool of surplus bricklaying labour isin London.No substantial difficulty occurs as regards woodworkers and other trades.Production.There is insufficient skilled labour to permit of three shifts of 8 hours daily,and in consequence two 10-hour shifts are being worked in the Ordnance factories and in contractors&apos; works so far as available skilled labour permits; exceptionally,three 8-hour shifts are being worked in T.N.T. factories. In Ordnance Factoriesalone, when full production is reached, 16,000 to 20,000 more skilled workers willbe needed, and steps to explore the possibilities of obtaining additional skilledpeople are being urgently pursued, notably through the relaxation of customagreement and by various schemes of training under the control of not only theMinistry of Labour and National Service, but of the Board of Education and incontractors&apos; works.The shortages concern more particularly the skilled engineering trades, anda census which is at present being taken regarding engineering, ship-building,motor and aircraft trades will, it is hoped, give valuable information; some of thefigures will be available early next month.There is no marked shortage of skilled labour in textile trades, althoughshortage may become apparent when new filling factories come into full production.Exemption and. Release from. Military Service.The steps taken to secure exemption from military service for skilled men inthe works of vital firms are, on the whole, working satisfactorily; but theprocedure for less essential firms does not work so smoothly. Some difficulties havealso arisen in connection with the exemption of certain classes of government employees.It may be necessary to press more strongly than hitherto for the release of skilled tradesmen from military service, and, in particular, the militaryauthorities have recently been asked for the release of tool-makers to the numberof about 1,000, with the object of increasing production of machine tools.Unskilled Workers.As regards unskilled workers, the shortage is not yet marked, but proposals are being considered for obtaining through the Labour Exchanges and the localauthorities some data as to the untapped reservoirs of female labour. This is atpresent a hidden reserve.(Initialled) E. L BThe Adelphi, W.C. 2, &apos; &apos;    &quot;April 20, 1940.
