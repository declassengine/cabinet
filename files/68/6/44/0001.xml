(10) 164.June 6. 1940.WAR CABINET.REPORTS FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 1940 FOR THE DOMINIONS.INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES, PROTECTORATES and mandated TERRITORIES.(Previous Reports : Paper No. W.P. (R.) (40) 137.)THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.1. General Position.AT the opening of Parliament on the 16th May, the Speech from the Throneforeshadowed legislation with regard to a National Unemployment InsuranceScheme and the immediate tabling of the report of the Royal Commission onDominion and Provincial Relations.Dr. Manion is reported by the press to have resigned the leadership of theConservative Party and to have been succeeded by Mr. R. B. Hanson.2. Naval, Military and Air Activity.The Canadian Government have made an offer, which has been accepted, to despatch two destroyers of the Royal Canadian Navy to co-operate with the royal navy in the West Indies. In response to a further suggestion from the UnitedKingdom Government, they have agreed to make available at the earliest possible moment, for service with the Home Flotilla of the Royal Navy, four destroyersof the Royal Canadian Navy at present based on Halifax.As regards co-operation on land, the Canadian Government have agreed toprovide a battalion for service in the West Indies to replace the United Kingdombattalion despatched to Curacao. One company will be stationed in Bermudaand the remaining three companies in Jamaica.The Canadian Government have also offered to arrange for the departureoverseas of the second Canadian Division to take place during June-July insteadof July-August, and to send overseas at an early date a second Army Co-operationSquadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force. They have at the same time indicatedtheir readiness to consider any suggestions from the United Kingdom Governmentfor further immediate land and air co-operation. In r-esponse to this invitation,the following suggestions have been put to them : (1) Despatch of an infantry brigade to Iceland.(2) Acceleration of despatch of the second Division if shipping can bearranged.(3) A definite decision to form a Canadian Corps and provision as soon aspossible of the balance of ancillary troops required for this formation.[21378] b
(4) Despatch to the West Indies of a battalion additional to that referredto above,(5) Initiation of arrangements for forming a third Division.(6) Provision of forestry and railway units.(7) Early despatch of the Army Co-operation Squadron accompanied by as many fully equipped Lysander aircraft as can be sent for its use.(8) Provision of a Royal Canadian Air Force fighter squadron, both aircraft and personnel, at 16 initial equipment.(9) Diversion to the Royal Air Force for the time being of the whole outputof Hurricane fighters from the Fort William factory.(10) Reconsideration of the possibility of providing six flying boats for the carribbean if the situation should demand the presence of general reconnaissance aircraft in that area.The Prime Minister of Canada has now announced that the despatch overseasof the second Division will be expedited, that the first and second Divisions willbe formed into a Canadian Corps, and that a third Division will be raised for service in Canada or overseas. The Canadian Government have further under-taken to provide and maintain an infantry brigade (as part of the 3rd CanadianCorps), for garrison service in Iceland, and an additional infantry battalion for service in the West Indies. They are also prepared to organise and despatchforestry and transportation units if they can be informed what types of units are most urgently required in present circumstances.As regards air assistance, the Canadian Government have stated that theArmy Co-operation Squadron referred to above was being sent overseas at theearliest possible moment, and that it would be equipped with 12 Lysander aircraft of Canadian manufacture as initial equipment (these being the only Lysanderaircraft available), provided that reinforcements can be supplied from UnitedKingdom sources. The Canadian Government are also sending overseas at theearliest possible moment a Fighter Squadron with all available Hurricanes, 14 in number, and have agreed that the whole output of Hurricanes from the FortWilliam factory should be diverted to the Royal Air Force for the time being.On the 28th May the Prime Minister of Canada announced in Parliamentfurther emergency measures, viz., the raising of additional rifle battalions for a4th Canadian Division, the recruitment of a further 5,000 men for the R.C.A.F.,and the organisation of Reserve Companies of Veterans.The Air Training Scheme is being developed as rapidly as possible, includingthe construction of buildings and new aerodromes.3. Legislative Action.Royal assent has been given to a Bill according to the women of Quebec theright to vote in Provincial elections. The Act will come into effect as from the1st January, 1941. This brings Quebec into line with all the other CanadianProvinces.4. Financial and Economic Action.The Canadian Government have requisitioned most of&apos; the foreign exchangeheld by Canadians.As a result of the visit to this country by Mr. Rogers, the Canadian Ministerof National Defence, further investigation is being made into the extent to whichCanadian industry can assist in the production of munitions.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.5. General Position.The coal strike has ended and the Prime Minister stated that no time wouldbe lost in reopening the mines. From recent press reports it appears that themining unions have undertaken to maintain continuity of production throughoutthe war; to observe the award of the Arbitration Court; and to resort in futureonly to legal machinery for the settlement of disputes.
The recent formation by Mr. J. T. Lang of the (Non-Communist) AustralianLabour Party has been denounced by the leader of the official Labour Party. Atthe Annual Conference of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions held inApril, a resolution endorsing the war policy laid down by the Federal LabourParty was only carried by 67 votes to 65, and the Government^ proposals for thedilution of labour engaged in war industries were rejected, although they had been endorsed by the Amalgamated Engineering Union by an overwhelming majority.These events, together with the Coal Strike, are regarded as evidence thatCommunists, although negligible as a force in the electorate, have succeeded inoccupying a number of key positions within the Labour movement.The Commonwealth Government have since amended the National Securityregulations in order to give greater control over subversive propaganda, and itis &quot;reported in the press that nine Communist newspapers have now been banned.6. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.(i) Navy.-Mr. Menzies announced on the 22nd May that the royal australian Navy would man ten local defence vessels under construction inAustralia for the Admiralty as Avell as seven for Australia. The personnel of australian destroyers abroad would be released and augmented as required for new destroyers, Australia continuing to maintain the old destroyers. Anti-submarine personnel would be trained for the Royal Navy in as large numbers aspossible. These measures involved the raising of 1,790 more naval personnel. Agraving dock for capital ships would be constructed at Sydney at a cost of A. 3 million.Anti-submarine vessels of Australian design are to be built in Australia forthe Admiralty. The total number of merchant ships defensively equipped inAustralia is now 146. One hundred and fifty depth charges, part of an order forthe Royal Indian Navy, have been shipped to Bombay.(ii) Army. The second contingent of the second at . disembarked inEgypt on the 17th May and proceeded to its allotted areas in Palestine. The thirdcontingent now en route has been diverted via the Cape and will proceed to theUnited Kingdom. Mr. Menzies announced on the 22nd May that a third divisionwill be raised for service overseas.(iii) Air Force. Eighty-six Hudsons and 58 Wirrawrays have now been delivered. An additional 49 Lockheed Hudsons are on order from the UnitedStates, where an order for 100 Wasp engines has also been placed, but theCommonwealth Government have agreed to release the Hudsons on completionto the United Kingdom. The total number of air crew personnel on the waitinglist to a recent date was 1,640.7. Legislative Action.There have been no particular developments.8. Economic Action.(i) Manufacture of Munitions and Aircraft. Expansion of the munitions production programme is proceeding. It is expected that the first 3-7 anti-aircraft gun of the series now in production at the Ordnance Factory atMaribyrnong will be ready for proof during June. A new gun-manufacturingshop will be erected at Maribyrnong and wall be equipped as machine tools cometo hand. The first shipment of rifles and small arms ammunition to the order ofthe United Kingdom Government has been made.        ,xShortage of supplies of raw material has in some cases delayed production for a short period, but, in general, supplies for defence works have been maintained.The Aircraft Production Commission, which held its first meeting at theend of March, has assumed control of the manufacture of 350 airframes for TigerMoth elementary trainers by the De Havilland Company; the manufacture of500 Gypsy Major engines (including spares) by General Motors-Holdens, Limited,for equipment of the Tiger Moths; an increased order (415) for Wirraways, plus500 engines, from commonwealth Aircraft Corporation; production of 180[21378] B 2
Beauforts, for Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force; manufactureof Twin Row Wasp engines for Beauforts for Australian delivery, at a factoryto be, established by Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, construction of main-planes for 200 of the 787 Avro Anson Aircraft, presented by the Air ministry for advanced training in the Empire Air Scheme, to be undertaken by the ClydeEngineering Company pf New South Wales; reconditioning as required of 437Fairey Battle Bombers and 523 Rolls-Royce Merlin engines; manufacture of400 airscrews and aircraft instruments; maintenance, including overhaul, of all aircraft engaged in the Empire Air Scheme and with the Royal Australian AirForce.Mr. Essington Lewis, Chief General Manager of Broken Hill Proprietary,Limited, has been appointed Director-General of Munitions and Supply.Mr. Lewis is empowered not only to use Government resources, but also to pressinto service civil factories in the reorganisation of munitions supply.(ii) Exchange and Import Control. Additional import licensing restrictions to exclude additional non-sterling imports valued at  1,650,000 came into effecton the 1st April.(iii) Export Control. Proclamations have been promulgated prohibiting theexport, except with Ministerial consent, of used newsprint, industrial diamonds,wolfram and scheelite.The measures of contraband control applied to exports to neutral countriesin Europe, in so far as they relate to the production of consignees&apos; undertakingsas to ultimate destination, in respect of shipments regarded as specially importantor under suspicion, are being applied also to exports to neutral countries outside europe.(iv) Wool.-The total clip is estimated at 3,400,000 bales with an approxi-mate value of  A. 57 million. Shipments from Australia to the middle of march were approximately 1,600,000 bales, of which 346,000 bales have been shipped todestinations other than British ports.(v) Wheat. By the 19th March satisfactory progress had been made towardsthe completion of contracts in respect of wheat and flour from No. 1 Pool.No. 1 Contract for 100,000 tons of wheat to the United Kingdom had been com-pleted, while No. 3 Contract, covering a similar quantity, was then nearing completion. Of the 50,000 tons of flour for the United Kingdom covered by no. 2 Contract, only 4,000 tons remained, and it was understood that this quantity was shortly being loaded for shipment.Receivals of wheat into No. 2 Pool as at the 19th March amounted to194,790,000 bushels. Allowing for sales recorded at that date and the anticipatedlocal consumption until the end of the season, there remained an exportable surplus of approximately 73,000,000 bushels. The position in regard to the contracts entered into in respect of No. 2 Pool wheat is not satisfactory becauseof shipping difficulties.The position of the flour milling industry has been causing concern. TheGovernment recently authorised the Australian Wheat Board to negotiate withcertain Japanese interests regarding the proposed sale of 200,000 tons of flourto Japan. The basis of the transaction is that payment is to be made 50 per cent,cash in American dollars, the balance of 50 per cent, on credit from twelve toeighteen months.NEW ZEALAND.9. General Position.Following on the recent death of Mr. Savage, a new Ministry, with the hon. Peter Fraser as Prime Minister, was sworn in on the 30th April. although there has been a redistribution of portfolios the Government remains essentially the same.The Annual Conference of the New Zealand Labour Party strongly endorsedrecent pronouncements of the Executive against Communism. As regards theParty&apos;s war policy, the Prime Minister has emphasized the solidarity of theParty and of the country in support of the war. A new Party the &apos;&apos; BritishNew Democratic Labour Party &apos;&apos; has been formed by Mr. J. A. Lee, a formerParliamentary Under-Secretary who was expelled from the Labour Party.
Parliament is meeting on the 30th May, and will be invited to pass legisla-tion on the lines of the United Kingdom Emergency Powers Defence Act.&quot;10. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.(i) Navy. Some 300 R.N.V.R. personnel recently embarked for the UnitedKingdom.(ii) Army. The second echelon of the New Zealand Special Force nowen route has been diverted via the Cape and will proceed to the United Kingdom.Recruiting is satisfactory; the maximum age limit has been raised to 40.(iii) Air Force. 53 acting Pilot Officers, 6 air observers and 50 air gunnershave proceeded to the United Kingdom since the outbreak of war. 669 pilots,210 observers, and 607 gunners were recently classified by the Second Boardof the Air Crew Selection Committee. 1,739 air crew applicants are awaitinginterview.The Minister for Defence has recently announced that, under the EmpireAir Training Scheme, New Zealand, by the end of the year, will have an annual output of 900 fully-trained pilots, 500 partly-trained, and 1,500 observers andair gunners, who will complete their training in Canada.11. Legislative Action.There have been no particular developments.12. Economic Action.The petrol rationing scheme is being amended as from the 1st June. Fromthat date cars up to 9-5 h.p. will be allowed 6 gallons per month; from 9-5 to14-5 h.p. 9 gallons per month; over 14-5 h.p. 12*gallons per month.Production of meat and dairy produce is being well maintained. The variousControls to regulate the control production are continuing satisfactorily.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.13. General Position.In the course of the debate on the Estimates for the Prime MinistersDepartment, Opposition speakers, including Dr. Malan, General Hertzog andMr. J. H. Viljoen, Whip to the Reunited Party, made much play with theconstitutional issue involved in the refusal of the Governor-General to grantGeneral Hertzog&apos;s request for a dissolution during the political crisis occasioned by the outbreak of the war. General Smuts made an effective reply, pointing outthat, if General Hertzog had had the Government behind him, it would have beena very different matter for him to ask for the dissolution, but in September theGovernment had not stood with him.The War Measures Bill has now passed its Third Reading in both Houses.The Electoral Laws Amendment Bill has now passed the Committee stage.There was lively opposition, on strictly party lines, during its progress.14. Naval, Military and A ir A activities.The total strength of all branches of the forces (excluding commandos) isnow 68,000. Of these, 53,200 have been asked to take a new oath whereby theyundertake to serve &quot;anywhere in Africa&quot;; 43,200 have taken the oath. Ofthose who refused to take the oath, it appears that very few did so for political reasons.A number of new units have been formed, including road construction andmaintenance companies and field ambulance units.The coastal defence works at Robben Island, Simonstown, Port Elizabeth andDurban are making good progress.
Beauforts, for Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force; manufactureof Twin Row Wasp engines for Beauforts for Australian delivery, at a factoryto be. established by Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, construction of main-planes for 200 of the 787 Avro Anson Aircraft, presented by the Air ministry for advanced training in the Empire Air Scheme, to be undertaken by the ClydeEngineering Company of New South Wales; reconditioning as required of 437Fairey Battle Bombers and 523 Rolls-Royce Merlin engines; manufacture of400 airscrews and aircraft instruments; maintenance, including overhaul, of all aircraft engaged in the Empire Air Scheme and with the Royal Australian AirForce.Mr. Essington Lewis, Chief General Manager of Broken Hill Proprietary,Limited, has been appointed Director-General of Munitions and Supply.Mr. Lewis is empowered not only to use Government resources, but also to pressinto service civil factories in the reorganisation of munitions supply.(ii) Exchange and Import Control.

Viljoen, Whip to the Reunited Party, made much playr with theconstitutional issue involved in the refusal of the Governor-General to grantGeneral Hertzog&apos;s request for a dissolution during the political crisis occasioned by the outbreak of the war.

Ofthose who refused to take the oath, it appears that very few did so for political reasons.A number of new units have been formed, including road construction andmaintenance companies and field ambulance units.The coastal defence works at Robben Island, Simonstown, Port Elizabeth andDurban are making good progress.
An officer of the Union Defence Forces has visited the General OfficerCommanding, East Africa, and has discussed with him detailed arrangementsfor the move of the Union Brigade Group to Kenya. The total strength of the brigade Group, with ancillary personnel, will be approximately 19,000. an anti-aircraft unit has left the Union for Mombasa, and will be available to protect the disembarkation of both the West African and the South African troops, whichare due to arrive in Kenya between the third week in June and the end of July.A number of Union aircraft (including bomber reconnaissance aircraft and tieonly four Hurricanes in the Union) are now in East Africa. In addition, thenecessary pilots and crews have been flown to Cairo to take delivery of the18 Gladiator aircraft which are to be used by the LTnion fighter squadron in east Africa.The Union Government have stated that another brigade is being trained as quickly as possible.As it will be necessary, in the event of hostilities with Italy, to send a largeproportion of the supplies for the Middle East Command via Mombasa to Cairo,the Union Government, at the request of the United Kingdom Government, haveagreed to provide the ten mechanical transport companies (each consisting of150 two-ton lorries) which would be required for road transport on the sectorbetween Soroti in Uganda and Juba in the Sudan.Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham arrived in the Union on the30th April, and he and his financial and technical advisers have since been engaged in discussions with the Union authorities about the possible expansionof air-training facilities there.15. Legislative and Economic Action.There is nothing to report.EIRE.16. General Position.The main development in the situation recently has been the growing-recognition by the Government of Eire of the serious danger of some kind ofGerman attack upon Eire. In consequence of this, the Eire Government have announced the calling-up of reservists and the institution of a new volunteerforce similar to the National Defence Volunteers in this country. A defence council has also now been constituted consisting of representatives ofMr. de Valera&apos;s party and of the Cosgrave and Labour oppositions.The Eire Government have, however, so far, not felt able to remove theGerman Minister in Dublin, or to take overt action against Germans in Eire,though it is understood that they are taking steps carefully to watch all theirmovements. Similarly, they have not, so far. been willing to offer any facilities,in advance, for the use of Eire ports by the Royal Navy.The Eire Government take the view that any action on their side to abandonneutrality in advance of an actual attack by Germany would set public opinion in Eire against the Government and afford an opportunity to the extremistminority to create serious difficulties. They say, however, that they are confident that, if a German attack should occur, the vast majority of the population of thecountry will fully support the Government in any measures which they may take to resist it.Arrangements have recently been made for the release to Eire of certainsupplies of munitions (including Bren guns) and aircraft and proposals for thesupply of certain naval equipment are being considered.17. Economic Action.The 1938 Trade Agreement with Eire on which existing trade relationsbetween the United Kingdom and that country are based has worked satisfactorily.Various new factors have, however, been injected into the situation by the war,with the result that it has for some time been felt in the United Kingdom that
discussions with Eire, which have hitherto been carried out on a basis of individual commodity, could with advantage be widened to produce a comprehensive review. The actual initiative came from the Eire side, and, theUnited Kingdom having concurred, the Eire Ministers of Supplies and agriculture visited London and a first meeting was held on the 30th April.In the course of the discussions which have followed it has become clearthat general agreement can be reached with the Eire representatives on suchimportant matters as joint chartering of ships, co-ordination of Eire&apos;s import programme with that of the United Kingdom, the possible expansion of storage,transhipment and ship repairing facilities in Eire ports, the joint purchase and allocation of certain imported foods [e.g.. sugar, cereals) and of feeding-stuffs, and the purchase by the United Kingdom of Eire&apos;s wool and flax cropsas well as certain of her food products and animal live-stock. The only important points of difference have proved to be the price at which the United kingdom is prepared to purchase butter, cheese and bacon from Eire. Eire maintainsthat the prices offered by the Ministry of Food would put her out of production;the Ministry of Food point out that the prices they offer are comparable withthose which they pay for similar products from New Zealand. Australia and canada, and that they could not be increased without undesirable repercussions on the agreements with these Dominions.Prolonged discussions have ensued with a view to bridging this gap. It hasbeen suggested that agreement may be reached on the basis that the Ministryof Food should buy Eire&apos;s surplus production of liquid milk, estimated at100 million gallons, at a price which will compensate Eire dairy farmers to theextent of something like  500,000, for the low prices offered for their butter and cheese, having regard to the increased cost of production resulting from thewar.   This proposal is, however, at present only in a tentative stage.NEWFOUNDLAND.18. General Position.The general question of the defence of Newfoundland has been under discus-sion. It has been arranged that conversations with Canadian representatives should take place at St. John&apos;s regarding the character and extent of any air operations in Newfoundland which the R.C.A.F. may be willing to undertake.In consequence, however, of a suggestion that Canada is anxious to take over for the duration of the war the use of, and responsibility for, the Newfoundlandair ports, the proposed discussion is being postponed until this latter point hasbeen considered by the Air Ministry.19. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.(i) The Navy. Up to the present 1,075 naval recruits have arrived from newfoundland (six contingents). The Admiralty have agreed to take 1,550more for training, at the rate of 200 per month.(ii) The Army. The first two contingents, amounting to 615 recruits forthe 57th Newfoundland Heavy Regiment, Royal Artillery, have arrived. Arrange-ments have been completed for despatching two further batches of about 150 meneach shortly.(iii) The Royal Air Force. The scheme for recruiting Newfoundlanders asground staff in the Royal Air Force has been sanctioned.20. Legislative Action.There is nothing to report.21. Economic Action.The Duke of Devonshire visited a number of camps in the North of scotland in order to explain to the Newfoundland loggers working there the national importance of the production of pit props, and to encourage them to re-engagefor a further period, instead of exercising their right to enlist in the Army
or in the Navy on the completion of their six months&apos; &apos;terms. The results ofthis visit are not yet known. Arrangements are in hand to obtain a further,000 loggers from Newfoundland to take the place of those who leave and to mansome additional camps.The Newfoundland Government have provided crews for seven ships onthe American side already, and are arranging crews for seven more. In addi-tion. 200 deck hands from Newfoundland are due to arrive in the United kingdom on the 29th May at the request of the Ministry of Shipping for employment inmanning ships.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.22. General Position.There are no developments to report.23. Military and Air Force Activities.The total number of Southern Rhodesia Army personnel now serving outsidethe Colony is 1,300. Over 300 are engaged in full-time training within theColony and over 700 in part-time training. Up to the end of April, over1,800 had volunteered for service with the Air Force, and of these 1,300 hadbeen passed as medically fit.Towards the end of the month, the Southern Rhodesia Government intro-duced compulsory part-time military training for all men in the Colony betweenthe ages of 18 and 55, except for a minimum number of men in reserved occupa-tions.  The Minister of Defence stated that this measure had three objectives :  (a) to provide a military force for internal security and for use in adjacentterritories in an emergency;(b) to ensure as large a contribution as possible to the Empire&apos;s effort; and(c) to maintain the Colony&apos;s economic front.In the last respect, the difficulty had been that a large number of men in essentialoccupations had been pressing for permission to enlist and serve with the fighting forces abroad. It is proposed to call up men for part-time training in age groups,the first group being 18-25.24. Legislative and Economic Action.There are no developments to report.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.25. Political Situation.My predecessor in his last monthly report drew attention to the increasing-signs of a strong and widespread desire in India for the emergence of someacceptable solution of the present political deadlock. This desire had been greatly strengthened by the invasion of Holland and Belgium and by the subse-quent course of the war. Indian sympathy with the Allied cause and Indian detes-tation of Nazism have assumed a new and much intenser form with the growing-realisation that India&apos;s own existence and her entire political future are at stake.In these circumstances I thought it expedient to lose no time while emphasising the continuity of our Indian policy, despite the change of Government, in making an appeal for a provisional accommodation between Hindus and Muslims whichwould at least enable Indian Ministries to resume office in the seven Proclamation-governed Provinces and would also facilitate the appointment to the Governor-GeneraFs Executive Council of representatives of both communities. The WarCabinet approved the terms in which this statement was made in both Houses of
Parliament on the 23rd May. My statement was supplemented by a broadcast,appeal by the Governor-General on the night of the 25th May.Shortly before my statement was made there had been indications that those,in control of Congress policy were becoming anxious lest the war situation shouldstimulate public sentiment (including that of Congressmen themselves) towardsgiving unstinted aid and co-operation to this country and so compromising thedemands of principle to which the Congress has hitherto rigidly adhered as theprice of its co-operation. The first reaction to my statement of prominentCongress spokesmen has been to insist that there can be no question of abatingthe demand for a declaration of India&apos;s independence and her right to self-determination by means of a Constituent Assembly or otherwise.A telegraphic summary which I have received of Indian press comment isnot very encouraging. But I expect shortly to receive from the Governor-Generalhis own estimate of the present position and of the chances of success which, might follow on a movement by him towards attempting to bring the political leadersof the two communities together again. It is, of course, quite possible that theIndian reactions to the events of the past few days in France and Belgium maymaterially affect the position. Meanwhile, however, I have just received from theGovernor-General without comment a copy of a letter he has received fromMr. Gandhi, dated the 26th May, in which he proposes, if His Majestj^s Govern-ment so desire, to go forthwith to Germany and plead with Hitler for peace onbehalf of humanity. The letter was in parts at all events occasioned by a telegram received by Gandhi from Sir Sikander Hyat Khan, the Premier of the Punjab,in which the latter had pleaded with him, in view of the present war situation,for a clear and magnanimous lead to the country for its whole-hearted support in the prosecution of the war.26. Military Affairs.(i) The second Indian Battalion which wras despatched from India to Adenearly this month arrived there on the 11th May.(ii) At the request of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Government of india have agreed to send eight Regular British Battalions to the United kingdom without waiting for the arrival of the Territorial Battalions which will be sent out to India in replacement. These battalions are expected to sail from India forthe United Kingdom early in June.(iii) The Government of India have offered, and been authorised, to raiseforthwith the following additional forces :  18 Infantry Battalions.2 Field Regiments, R.A.Sappers and Miners and Signal units for 6 Divisions.The necessary Formation Headquarters, base organisations, medical and supply services.In addition, they propose to train personnel for another two Indian Air Force squadrons.(iv) In view of the situation in the Mediterranean, the two bomber squadrons, R.A.F., which returned to India from Singapore last month, have, atthe request of His Majesty&apos;s Government, been sent one to Egypt and the otherto Aden.(v) For several months the Government of India have maintained all Britishand Indian troops in the Middle East in many articles of clothing and generalstores. They have now accepted responsibility for the maintenance there of a force of up to 12 Divisions, and they are laying down 9 months&apos; reserves of thearticles supplied by them.27. Foreign and Frontier Relations.(i) Afghanistan.-On the 1st May His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul conveyed to the Afghan Prime Minister an assurance of support from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment m the event of Russian aggression on Afghanistan. The PrimeMinister received this assurance with obvious relief and gratitude. His Majesty&apos;minister suggested that in order to implement the assurance and work out inadvance details of our assistance a visit to Kabul by a military expert Brigadier.   [21378] &apos;     &apos;   c&amp;
Moiesworth, from India would be imperative. The Prime Minister promised todiscuss this suggestion with the War Minister.     ^Unfortunately, the British withdrawal from Norway, followed by the Germansuccess in the Low Countries, caused a considerable setback in Afghan opinion which had been strengthening in favour of the Allies, and this has retarded aent for a closer approach to the British Government. The younger membersmovement for a closer approach to the British Government, ine younger memueisof the Afghan Government are reported to be convinced of a German victory andblind to the dangers resulting from the presence of the Germans m Afghanistan.As the result no further approach was made from the Afghan side until the23rd May, when the Afghan Foreign Minister, after apologising for the delay,said that he had now managed to convince the King and senior members of theCabinet that the only hope for Afghanistan was to stand firmly by their policyof friendship with the British people. They did not, however, feel that in thepresent circumstances they could take the risk of giving offence to Russia byreceiving a British military expert in Kabul and openly concerting plans for defence with His Majesty&apos;s Government as they would like to do. They were,however, prepared to send an officer of their own General Staff to Simla to discussplans with the Indian General Staff. His Majesty&apos;s Minister has recommendedthat this proposal should be accepted as a first step.The menace of Russian aggression seems at the moment less imminent anda mere immediate danger, both to British interests and to the Afghan Govern-ment themselves, arises from the presence of German agents in Afghanistan. HisMajesty&apos;s Minister has been instructed to take every opportunity of emphasisingthis danger in his discussions with Afghan Ministers.In addition to the 20 lakhs for road-making mentioned in the last report as having been offered the Afghan Government by the Government of India, theGovernment of India have offered to supply as a free gift 5,000 rifles and other equipment and \ million rounds of S.A.A. to replace material supplied fromKabul to the Afghan Northern Army, who were reported to be badly in need ofsuch stores. This offer has been made by the Government of India as a response to a personal appeal from the King of Afghanistan to our Minister. Approvalhas also been obtained for the offer to the Afghan Government of credits to theamount of  2-1- million spread over five years, to be used for industrial oragricultural development, for road building and for purchase of armaments.(ii) North-West Frontier. In the early part of the month there was somerecrudescence of raiding in the Bannu district, but later reports indicate thatraiding in the settled districts has been checked. The improvement in thesituation in Waziristan has been maintained, and except for a continuation of minor offences in North Waziristan there are no hostilities to report. Severalhostiles have made their submission during the month. In the Ahmadzai Salientroad-making has been practically completed and the situation is considered tohave been sufficiently cleared up to admit of control being handed back to thepolitical authorities.At a big jirga in the Kurram Agency on the 19th May all people of theKurram Valley offered staunch loyalty and help to the Indian government against their enemies. A well-known Mahsud leader, Musa Khan, has writtenoffering to raise a force of 20,000 Mahsuds in the event of Russian aggression on india. The Mohmand leader, Badshah Ghul, also is reported to have repeatedhis instructions that they should help either the British or the Afghan Govern-nient against Russian attack.(iii) Sivkiang.- In spite of the instructions of the Chinese Central Govern-ment that the British wireless station at Kashgar is not to be interfered with,the Kashgar Commissioner in a letter dated the 23rd May has requested theimmediate closure of the wdreless station, pointing out to the Consul-General thatthe time-limit had expired on the 1st May. The Consul-General is replying witha refusal to take action on the ground that the Chinese Central Government had given permission for the station to remain open.(iv) Tibet.-Mr. B. J. Gould, Political Officer in Sikkim, who visited Lhasaas British representative at the ceremonies in connection with the installation of the Dalai Lama, which took place towards the end of February, has stayedon for discussions with the Tibetan Government. His reports indicate that &quot;his visit has been of considerable value towards the maintenance of our position inTibet and the strengthening of the friendly relations with the Tibetans whichhave&quot; been cultivated by our mission in Lhasa.
The Chinese representative who visited Lhasa in the same connection appearsnot to have conducted his visit with the same tact, and met with no success in anyattempt to emphasise Chinese suzerainty.(v) Portuguese India. For some time past the Government of India have feltconcern at the danger that the Portuguese territories in India might be used, with or without the connivance of the local Portuguese authorities, for the promotion of enemy activities. Three German merchant ships with their crews have takenrefuge in Goa, and there are wireless installations in Goa which might be usedfor communication with the enemy. The Government of India have strengthenedtheir consular representation by creating a post of Consul-General, to be heldconcurrently by the Consul-General at Pondicherry, in addition to that of Consul(held by a railway official). The Consul-General was entrusted with the task of negotiating an agreement with the Governor-General to enable the Governmentof India to place police officers in Goa for watch on enemy activities, and to conduct censorship of private mails and to tighten control over the use of wireless.With a view to securing fuller co-operation from the Governor-General, whose attitude has been far from helpful, the Embassy in Lisbon, at the request of theGovernment of India, made representations early in May to the portuguese government, who undertook to instruct the Governor-General to reach agreementwith us in regard to our requirements. It is hoped that this action will enablethe Government of India to complete their security arrangements.28. Indian States.Conditions in the States as a whole remain peaceful. The Hindu-Moslemtension in India generally has, however, led to an overflow from British Indiato the States of various volunteer organisations, in particular the Khaksars.In Kashmir, parades of bodies other than the State Forces. Police and BoyScouts are now7 forbidden, and in Hyderabad, where the inauguration of ascheme of reforms, associating the Nizam&apos;s Hindu and Moslem subjects with departments of the Government in equal proportions on various advisory com-mittees, which had been announced last summer, has since been delayed owingto communal tension, the Government profess nervousness of the revival of aHindu non-co-operation movement. The Nizam has now been advised to proceedforthwith with the less contentious measures of reform. The latest information is that Mr. Gandhi is reported to have advised against starting civil disobediencein Hyderabad through fear of the communal disorder which it would cause there.The Maharaja of Charkhari, a small State in Central India, has been suspended from the exercise of ruling powers, and has agreed to reside at a distance from his State, as a result of proof of serious financial maladministra-tion. In Manipur State, bordering on Assam, there has been considerable unrestowing to excessive export of the rice crop, which has called for remedial action by the Political authorities. It is reported that Naga villagers recently con-cerned in a fanatical movement which had to be forcibly suppressed have nowdeclared their adhesion to Congress.Considerable contribution towards the Viceroy&apos;s War Purposes Fund and war charities continue to be received from Rulers. These amounted at the endof April to some  400,000, and, in addition, some  270,000 in annually recurringcontributions. The Gaekwar of Baroda has recently presented a sum of about 40,000 to purchase a flight of Lysander aircraft for India. The Nizam hasalso given the Air Ministry  50,000 for maintenance of the two Squadrons ofthe Royal Air Force raised from sums already presented by him. A considerablenumber of ambulances have also been presented by various States. Roadmakingplant has been made available by certain States for despatch to the middle east, and others have offered their railway and public works department shopsfor manufacture of munitions. On completion of training with the british forces in British India a number of units of Indian States Forces have returnedto the States subject to liability for further service with the forces of theCrown when required.29. Economic.There are few outstanding developments under this head to report thismonth. After somewhat lengthy consideration the Government of India have introduced a system of controlling imports with a view to fortifying the exchange[21378] D
position of the sterling area of which, through the link between sterling and therupee. India forms part. In normal conditions there is on the whole a balancefavourable to India in the transactions between India and the countries of whichthe currencies are in strong demand for Allied war purposes. India is, therefore,a source of strength to the sterling area, and the value of this will be increasedby the measures now introduced by an amount of some  3 million a year.In the field of supply two points are worth mentioning. Discussions havetaken place with the Ministry of Supply and the Wool Control on certain difficulties arising out of the export of East Indian Wool to the United Kingdom.The Wool Controller has made proposals which, if the Government of Indiaconcur in them, will bring the arrangements for the supply of Indian wool more into line with those for wool from other parts of the Empire. Secondly, theMinistry of Food propose to purchase up to 200.000 tons of sugar from India,where there is at present a surplus, which can be substituted for supplies thatwould otherwise have to be obtained from outside the sterling area. This will necessitate the suspension of India&apos;s obligation not to export sugar under theInternational Sugar Convention.Reference has been made before to the German trade in dye-stuffs and tothe firm of Chemdyes, which existed for the purpose of distributing these dyesin India. The controlling interest of Chemdyes is in the hands of certain Dutchcompanies and individuals, whose associations with Germany were such that before the invasion of Holland it had been decided to recommend that they shouldbe placed on the Statutory list. The Government of India have now decidedto treat Chemdyes as an enemy firm, to vest its property in the Custodian of enemy Property and to instruct him to put it up for sale by auction. It isexpected that in this way the stocks, property and goodwill of Chemdyes will pass into the hands of Imperial Chemical Industries, who, with the approval and assistance of His Majesty&apos;s Government, are arranging as rapidly as possibleto expand their production. British industry should therefore be in a positionto capture from the German chemical industry a market worth over  2 million a year.30. Finance.War Savings. The Government of India propose to launch immediatelya War Savings movement on the lines of that in the United Kingdom. The issuescontemplated are (i) 10-year Defence Savings Certificates, tax free; (ii) 3 percent. Defence Bonds, subject to income tax, and repayable in 6 years at 1 per cent,premium; and also (iii) a 3-year loan without interest, to which it is hoped thatorthodox Moslems and patriotic firms may subscribe. The scheme is the outcome of a recent widespread demand for some issues that will enable people to assistthe war effort. If subscriptions prove to be on a substantial scale, it shouldalso have the advantage of helping to counteract inflationary tendencies in India.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.31. General.No further recrudescence of the Hindu-Moslem communal rioting referredto in the previous report has occurred, and the situation throughout the countryin general has been quiet. Agreement has been reached with the Government ofIndia for deporting to India the hooligans, numbering 150-200, primarily responsible for the rioting in April. They are to be sent to their places of originin India in batches of about 50 a week after summary proceedings have been taken against them.The Governor reports that it is too early to state whether the apparentsuccess of German arms may not encourage extremist elements to try to makecapital out of the situation in Europe. But the news of the invasion of holland and Belgium was received with horror and indignation, and there are signs ofthe growing realisation of the necessity for an Allied victory.
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Tenth Monthly Report submitted by the Secretary of State for the colonies covering the period May 1 to 31, 1940.(Note. In this report &apos;&apos; Colonies &apos;&apos; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident at Zanzibar.)GENERAL REPORT.35. Precautions against possible Italian Hostilities.In view of the possibility of an outbreak of war with Italy, it has beendecided to evacuate certain of the civil population from Gibraltar and Aden.The wives and families of Service personnel in Gibraltar are being evacuated tothe United Kingdom, and priority is being given to those of the Navy, Army andAir Force, but the Governor has been informed that the wives and families of theCivil Service and Censors may be included if shipping accommodation permits.Arrangements are being made for other members of the civilian population to be evacuated to French Morocco in accordance with a scheme discussed by the gibraltar authorities and the Governor of French Morocco. It is estimated thatthere are approximately 13,000 persons in all to be evacuated. The number ofpersons involved in Aden is approximately 160 Europeans and 2,000 Indians, all of whom it is proposed to evacuate to India.No wholesale evacuation of the civil population from Malta is proposed; but since the S.S. Oronsay was, in any case, calling there, it was decided to take theopportunity to evacuate certain families, and 996 families have been embarkedin that vessel.(Secretary ofState&apos;telegram to governor,Gibraltar, No.192. Secret, ofMay 19, 1940.)(Secretary ofState&apos;telegram to governor,Aden, No. 206,Secret, ofMay 16, 1940.)36. Release of Colonial Service Personnel for Dtity with Military Forces in africa.On the 15th May a telegram was sent to the African Colonial Governorsstating that the increasing gravity of the situation had made it necessary to reconsider the policy regarding the release of civil personnel for duty with theMilitary Forces in Africa. The telegram stated that the military establishments in East and West Africa should be completed with the least possible delayregardless of inconvenience to and disturbance of the machinery of civil govern-ment. This telegram cancels, so far as concerns Africa, the statement of policyissued on the outbreak of war to the effect that Colonial officials should not be released for military service unless they could be spared without detriment to thecivil Government.[21378](Secretary ofState&apos;telegram,Secret, ofMay 15, 1940.)(Secretary ofState&apos;scirculartelegram ofSeptember 21,1939.)D 2Press and Propaganda. Revived interest in the Urdu broadcasts fromZeesen, which are described as more attractive than the British broadcasts, isreported and steps to deal with it are under consideration. The attitude of thePress to recent events has been satisfactory.32. Defence.Nothing to report.33. External Relatimis.Nothing to report.34. Economic.(a) Internal. Nothing to report.(b) External. Exports continue at a very satisfactory level and the total figure for April was higher than for any month since the separation of Burmafrom India in 1937. This is no doubt in part due to the large quantities of ricestill going to Japan (cf. previous report).
37. Internment.The Governors of the Mediterranean Colonies, and of Palestine, Aden,Kenya, Somaliland and Tanganyika were informed by telegram of the new measures relating to aliens which have been found necessary in certain parts ofthe United Kingdom, and asked to consider whether, in the event of war with italy, it would be desirable to impose restrictions on similar lines in these terri-tories. As a result a number of enemy aliens in Cyprus, Kenya and Tanganyikahave been reinterned and special restrictions have been imposed on all&apos;aliens in malta, Kenya and Tanganyika. All Colonies have been informed of the policy(Secretary of proposed to&apos;be adopted in the United Kingdom in the event of war with Italy incircular regard to the internment of Italians, and it has been suggested that a policy ontelegram        similar lines should be adopted so far as local conditions make it desirable.No. 51 ofMay 10, 1940.)38. Exchange Control, Export and Import Licensing.The system continues to work satisfactorily. It has now been agreed to propose to the Colonies the adoption of the Australian system of securing for theauthorities securities held in foreign countries, under which instead of the securities being actually taken over by Government as in the United Kingdom,holders are ordered to sell within a limited period and transfer the proceeds tothe Control.Instructions have been issued to issue no export licences for Holland and toissue them for Belgium only if the ship in which the consignment in question iscarried calls at a United Kingdom or French port on the way to Belgium.No instructions for the relaxation of control of imports from the netherlands and Belgium have been issued, and in present circumstances that would appearto have no purpose. Fresh instructions with regard to imports from the Nether-lands East Indies and other Colonial possessions of the Netherlands and Belgiumwill be issued as soon as the position regarding exchange with those territoriesis finally cleared up, but for the present they remain subject to import restrictions.39. Supply of Colonial Products.Rubber. Intimation has been received from the American Government oftheir intention to purchase large quantities of rubber for stock. suggestions which were originally put forward for a new and more extensive barter agreementhave now been dropped, and the United States Government intend to proceedthrough a Corporation to be formed for this special purpose in collaboration with american manufacturers. On the basis of assurances that the United StatesGovernment intends to purchase all available rubber in the near future, and after full discussion with all the interested Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government,the International Rubber Regulation Committee decided on the 21st May to fix the quota of release for the third and fourth quarters of 1940 at 80 per cent, (the quota which is in force for the present quarter), instead of 65 or 70 per cent.,which would have been fixed on the basis of previous estimates of consumption;and further to recommend that licences for the whole of the six months should beissued at once, and that shipments should be permitted even in advance of theissue of licences. The effect of this is to enable producers to ship in the immediatefuture all the rubber which they have available or can produce at short notice,and the Committee intimated privately that if necessary the percentage of releasewould be increased at a subsequent meeting, so that production could, in fact, bemaintained at the highest figure attainable. A number of details regarding theAmerican purchases remain, however, to be settled, and arrangements have, there-fore, been made with the United States Government for Sir John Hay to &amp;o to america, leaving England on the 30th May, as the fully accredited representativeboth of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the International Rubber RegulationCommittee, for the purpose of discussing details. Further steps to render morerubber available Avill be considered after Sir John Hay has completed had discussions.At the same time the rubber industry has expressed its willino-ness toco-operate in every way with the Ministry of Supply, which is endeavourino- toacquire certain stocks of rubber for the British Government, and it has been
intimated to the United States Government that if necessary we shall have to reserve a sufficient part of the production for shipment to the Allies either bymeans of control of exports through the licensing system or otherwise.Tin. A very similar situation exists as regards tin, except that, sinceconsumption is much closer to possible production, there is less prospect of theUnited States Government being, in fact, able to acquire large stocks. Afterdiscussions between the interested Departments and the British repre-sentatives the International Tin Committee the Committee agreed at its meeting on the 27th May to increase the present quota of release from 80 percent, to 100 per cent. In addition it will, if necessary, be willing later on toincrease the quota to, say, 120 per cent., which will be a nominal figure havingthe effect of removing all restrictions. It is proposed that representatives shouldalso be sent to America to discuss details of purchases of tin and for this purpose it is probable that the International Tin Committee will be represented by Mr. Vanden Broek, one of the Netherlands delegates now on his way from Batavia to america, and Mr. V. A. Lowinger, one of the Malayan delegates.Sugar. The Sugar Division of the Ministry of Food have now- pratically complete their arrangements for the purchase from Empire producers of the1940-41 crops, terms having been agreed with producers in Australia, SouthAfrica, Mauritius, Fiji and the greater part of the West Indian producers. TheIwsic price to be paid to Colonial producers is 8s. 10^d. a hundredweight, that isIs. i-\d. higher than the price paid for the 1939-40 crops. It appears to be generally agreed that this represents an allowance fair to both parties for the additional costs of material and labour which have already been established. The Dominionproducers have generously agreed to a modification of the arrangements as tofreight, which will mean, in effect, that they will receive 7^d. less than Colonialproducers, i.e., an increase of only 9rf. a hundredweight on last year&apos;s price.They have made it clear that they have done this only in view of the special difficulties of Colonial producers during the war and that it will not prejudicetheir rights to equal treatment.Cocoa. By agreement with the Ministry of Food definite instructions havebeen sent to the Governors of Nigeria and the Gold Coast to proceed with arrange-ments for the destruction of the mid-season crop as it is clear that there is no prospect of being able to market it. A statement to this effect has been made inParliament.Oilseeds and Vegetable Oils. The change in the situation owing to theaddition of Netherlands East Indies supplies to the already embarrassingly large supplies of certain oilseeds available in the Allied territories is being examined.Citrus F?&apos;fit . Approval has been given for the guaranteeing of advancesby the banks to citrus growers in Palestine in view of the current difficulties caused by the uncertain situation in the Mediterranean, but final details are still under discussion.40. Supply of Food-stuffs to the Colonies.The invasion of the Netherlands has cut off a large proportion of the supplyof condensed milk, which is an important article of diet in many of the tropicalColonies. In order to replace the supplies previously drawn from the netherlands and those from this country, which will no longer be available to the same extent,enquiries are being made as to whether the Dominions can provide increasedquantities, and in the meanwhile Governors have been given discretion to licenseessential imports of condensed milk from the United States.41. Shipping.Judging by the fact that fewer complaints are now being received from theColonies regarding acute shortages of shipping, it is reasonable to assume thatthe control of shipping is now functioning more smoothly from the Colonial pointof view. Two small and isolated problems, i.e., those of the Western Pacific copratrade and the Seychelles banana trade, remain unsolved. A satisfactory settlementhas been reached which the Ministry of Shipping regarding proposals from malaya and the East African Dependencies for ensuring that these Governments arekept fully informed of the policy and decisions of the Ministry of Shipping&apos;slocal representatives.
REPORTS ON PARTICULAR COLONIES.42. Northern Rhodesia.Disturbances on the Copperbelt. The Commission of Inquiry into the recent disturbances on the Northern Rhodesia Copperbelt arrived in the Territory onthe 11th May. They are being assisted in their investigations by three localassessors, Mr. M. Ferguson, Mr. R. Welensky and Lieutenant-Colonel S. Gore-Browne, D.S.O., who have been appointed to represent respectively the points ofview of the mine managements, the European employees and the Africanemployees.Work on the mines is now proceeding normally and no further incidentshave been reported. It is possible, however, that the strikes and the disturbancesmay have future repercussions in view of the intensification of racial feeling between the European and African workers to which it is feared they may havegiven rise.43. Somaliland.Grazing Rights A greement. As stated in the February report, the ItalianGovernment were asked to prolong the Somaliland Grazing Rights and TransitTraffic Agreements for one year from the 29th March. A reply has now beenreceived to the effect that the Italian Government are not in a position to accede to this request as the agreements in question need to be revised, but thatthey would be prepared to start negotiations -with a view to concluding new agreements.His Majesty&apos;s Representative at Rome has been asked to elucidate the intentions of the Italian Government in the matter.44. Uganda.teWrnmr&apos;? Legislation based on a Kenya model, to provide for (a) compulsory militaryNo. 88, service; (b) compulsory personal service; and (c) the management of businessesConfidential, of the owners of which have been called away for military service, was introducedMay 17,1940.) and enacted on the 17th May.(Governors An Ordinance for the establishment of a local defence corps somewhat similarNVg89am to ^iat established in England to meet the parachute menace has also beenConfidential, of enacted.May 17&apos; 1940 ) 45. British Honduras.The President of Guatemala has submitted a proposal for an out-of-courtsettlement of the Treaty dispute, referred to in the reports of February and march, on the basis of the cession to Guatemala of approximately half of british honduras, and, in addition, a cash payment of f 5 million. Our representative in Guatemala has been informed that this proposal offers no basis on which to conduct? negotiations, and that we are not prepared to agree to any cession of territory. He has been instructed at the same time to do what he can to keepthe negotiations open, in accordance with a suggestion made by the United states under-Secretary of State, in the hope that in the course of time the Presidentmay adopt a more reasonable and less uncompromising attitude.(Foreign office telegram No.52 to HisMajesty&apos;sRe present a-tive,Guatemala.)46. Ceylon.Since the last report the Governor has reported that conferences havebeen taking place between the Ceylon Minister of Labour, the planters&apos; repre-sentatives. and the representatives of the labour unions on conciliation measures in paragraph 36 of the report for April, reference was made to certain difficulties caused by the restrictions upon Norwegian ships calling at ports inthe Netherlands East Indies. Now that Holland has become an Ally all restrictions on the movement of Norwegian ships to Dutch Colonial ports havebeen removed.
for the planting industry. But particularly in regard to the Indian franchisethere is no progress yet towards a more accommodating spirit, although some sign of doubt amongst the Sinhalese majority members of the State Council has been shown in a recent debate in Council on a Resolution submitted by Members fora more restrictive policy in the matter of admission of Indians to the electoralregister, and the debate has been left adjourned. But the Governor isapprehensive about the existing situation and has recommended that the electionsshould be postponed for a year and that a Commissioner should be sent out fromthis country to investigate the present position. These recommendations arebeing considered at the moment.47. Malaya.financial Measures.Legislation has been enacted in Malaya for the purpose of raisingspecial additional revenue by taxation to provide further contributions to HisMajesty&apos;s Government towards Imperial war expenditure. The Sultan ofSelangor has made a free gift of  1.000 to His Majesty&apos;s Government as a contribution towards the cost of the prosecution of the war, and His Highness the sultan of Perak has contributed $50,000 ( 5,833 65. 8d.) in the form of a loan,free of interest for the duration of the war, for a similar purpose. the sultan of the Malay State of Trengganu, on learning that Britain had gone to the help of Holland and Belgium, offered a gift of $50,000 for the prosecution of the war. The offer has been gratefully accepted. Other individual giftshave also been offered.Communist Demonstrations.Following May Day celebrations in, Singapore, a collision occurred betweenChinese Communist demonstrators and the police. The Government received information of the intention to hold mass meetings with the avowed objects ofinciting anti-Imperialist anti-capitalist agitation and resistance to the localauthorities. The demonstrations were successfully split up by the police, but onepicket of 20 police was attacked and suffered injuries at the hands of a largemob armed with heavy billets of wood and bottles. The police had to defend themselves with revolver shots and four of the demonstrators were wounded, twoof them fatally.There has been no further unrest, and the Governor does not anticipate a renewal of the disturbances.Defence Policy. Reference was made in the report for March (W.P. (R)(40) 107) to certain difficulties which had arisen regarding the defence policyof Malaya with special reference to the training of the Volunteer Force.   Thegeneral defence policy is now being further reviewed by the Chiefs of Staffin the light of the German invasion of Holland, which naturally has repercussions on Malaya in view of the close proximity to Singapore of the netherlands east Indies. Meanwhile the Acting Governor has been informed that the training (Secretary ofof the Volunteer force in accordance with the recommendations of the Oversea feie^ram to defence Committee, referred to in the March report, is more than ever important, o.lSG-a,No.52i,and he has also been asked to give urgent consideration to the introduction Secret, ofof compulsory service legislation. May 18&apos; 1940-)4&apos;8. Aden.The negotiations for a settlement of outstanding frontier questions with the yemen have made no progress since last month. The Imam has now telegraphedto His Majesty the King demanding, in effect, that Shabwa and Al Abr shouldbe incorporated in the Yemen. The agreed instructions to the British repre-sentative in the negotiations made it clear that in no circumstances could His^fajesty&apos;s Government agree to the ceding of these two places, but that they might agree to the neutralisation of Shabwa and, in the last resort, also of Al Abr.h is not contemplated that these instructions to him should be varied.As stated in the report for April, air action has had to be taken duringthe last month against Bin Abdat in the Hadramaut. A report has recently beenreceived from the Governor that his submission has been secured, but the exactterms of his submission are still the subject of correspondence with the Governor.
49. Palestine and Transjordan.The internal security situation remains satisfactory. As far as the Arabsare concerned, the fellaheen are fully occupied with the harvest and are disinclined,for the present at least, to take an active interest in political questions. The overtJewish agitation against the Land Transfers Regulations has considerablyabated: this may be due in part to the differences of opinion known to exist inthe Executive of the Jewish Agency between those leaders who wish to maintain their opposition to the Governments policy and those who are anxious to shelvepolitical controversy in present circumstances.The position of the Arab political parties remains extremely confused, andthere is at present no sign of the formation of any group sufficiently strong and united to give an effective lead to Arab opinion.Recent cases in which Arabs have been executed on conviction by the military courts for offences committed during the disturbances, have caused much bitter-ness, both within Palestine and in neighbouring countries. Representations onthis subject have been made to His Majesty&apos;s Government by the Egyptian, Iraqiand Saudi Arabian Governments, and I am now considering their proposals inconsultation with the High Commissioner and the Departments concerned. Inthe meantime, the High Commissioner has appointed a committee to considerthe extent to which the Emergency Regulations can now, in view of the great improvement in the internal situation, be modified. He has also agreed that, inview of the present delicate situation in Iraq and Egypt, any prosecutionsinvolving capital charges arising out of the past disturbances should be delayedfor the next few weeks.Reference was made in the report for April to the case in which a numberof JeAvs at Ben Shemen were convicted for the illegal possession of arms. TheG.O.C. was able, having regard to the general situation, substantially to reducethe sentences imposed by the Military Court. This case caused great excitementamong the Jewish community, and a manifesto wras issued by the Chief Rabbinate,the Jewish Agency and the Vaad Leumi expressing their sympathy with and support of the accused. In these circumstances, the G.O.C. decided to summon a meeting of Jewish leaders, at which he made it clear that the Governmentcould not connive at the illegal possession of arms by Jewe and would be compelled to take proceedings under the Emergency Regulations in all cases inwhich adequate information was forthcoming relating to the possession of illegalarms. He realised, however, that these cases embittered the relations of theJewish community with Government, and he therefore suggested that all hiddenarms should be declared, in return for which the Government would make thefollowing concessions :-(1) The settlement police would not be reduced below present strength.(2) A proportion of the arms (excluding machine guns, bombs and explosives)might be registered and held by the Jewish community.(3) Arms in excess of the permitted number would be collected and storedby the Government.(4) No proceedings would be taken against those who declared stores of armswithin a definite period.The representatives present at the interview were invited to consider theseproposals and to discuss with the G.O.C. at a further meeting. A report onsubsequent developments is awaited.The increasing gravity of the international situation has resulted in somepressure on the weaker banks.
