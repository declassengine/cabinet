MINISTRY   OP   ECONOMIC . VVARFARjI.WEEKLY REPORT Oil ACTION TAKEN FOR THB PERIODAj?-11 28TH TO LAY 5TH. 19UO.War Trade Negotiations and Relations with Neutral Countries .Air Mail Traffic.An Interdepartmental Meeting has &quot;been held to consider theaction which could be taken to deal with civil air traffic to spain and to America which is now evading Allied control to an increasing extent.2.       The meeting considered the question of negotiations with theItalian Government to induce them to agree that Italian servicesflying between Italy and Spain, including Italian aircraft on theSouth American service, should land at Marseilles or in Corsica,and there submit voluntarily to Allied control.     The meetingagreed that it was noti possible to contemplate at the presentmoment, in view of the general policy cf His Majesty&apos;s government towards Italy, negotiations with the Italian Government in thecourse of which they would be told that, if they refused to submit to air control, the Allies would enforce a stricter control overItalian shipping.   The meeting recommended, however, that a reply should be sent to recent Italian applications for facilities to start air services across Allied &quot;territory, to the effect thatsuch facilities could not he granted at a time whan--Italian air services between Italy and Spain are known to he carryingcontraband and enemy exports.3.       As regards the German air service via Italy to Spain, themeeting took note of the extreme difficulty of interceptingoccasional German aeroplanes flying &quot;by night over, the western mediterranean, but thought that further consideration should begiven to the desirability of attempting to intercept these Germancivil aircraft.4-&apos;       The meeting also decided, that an attempt   should be made to/arrange

-2-arrange that Pan-American Airways should resume their calls atBermuda, and submit there to Allied control; the british ambassador in Washington should be authorised to approach theUnited States authorities on this point.5.       It was further decided to recommend that representationsshould he made to the Dutch Government by the French Minister atthe Hague, with the support of his British colleague, against theestablishment of the K.L.M. air service between Holland and Spain,which at present flies over the Channel following the French coastall the way outside territorial waters.6.       Finally, it was agreed that informal soundings should bemade of the Portuguese authorities, in order to see how theywould regard the possibility of allowing the Allied authoritiesto operate some form of control over air services between europe and America, e.g. at the Cape Verde Islands and the Azores,SWEDEN .7.       As a result of the German occupation of southern norway and our failure to re-open the Trondheim route, the Swedes are placed in the position of seeing all their principal channels oftrade closed except with or through Germany.   A Swedish delegationis to visit Berlin about May 12th and expects to be faced withdemands for additional deliveries to Germany in return for thesupply of coal and coke and for shipping facilities.   The Swedishauthorities have expressed the hope that we shall agree to temporary modifications (as yet imspecif ied) of the Anglo-SwedishWar Trade Agreement so as to avoid its termination.   His Majesty&apos;sLegation at Stockholm have emphasized the necessity of maintainingin force the existing British contracts for Sv/edish special steels,pig iron, ferro-alloys etc. even tho\igh this might involve their being taken over by His Majesty&apos;s Government.    Should they be cancelled the Swedes would have difficulty in resisting pressure to sell the goods to Germany.3.       Meanwhile such steps as are possible are being taken tokeep open Swedish trade with the west.     The possibility of/using

/SPAIN AND PORTUGAL .using Pet same- and Kirkenes is being examined and also of sending a trial ship to Gothenburg..    To alleviate the Swedish position wehave waived our rights in a few cases and permitted trade throughGermany.   The Swedes on their side are examining the possibilitiesof increasing their trade with Russia.    It would be idle, however,to expect such measures to have much effect upon the situation.FINLAND.9.       A meeting took place last week in Stockholm attended by representatives of the Swedish Government and of the Finnish and norwegian Legations in that town, to discuss the possibilitiesof using Kirkenes, in addition to Petsamo for imports intoFinland.SWITZERLAND .10.     The Swiss authorities propose to bring into effect onthe 10th May the new system of import control by means of certificates of guarantee, which was envisaged under the Agreement.11.     Telegrams from Berne leave no room for doubt that the signing of the Agreement has been badly received in Berlin.THE NETHERLANDS.12.     A Franco-Netherlands War Trade Agreement, similar to that already initialled in London, was initialled in Paris on May 4th.ITALY.13-     Tension in regard to contraband control, to which reference was made in paragraph 8 of last&apos;week&apos;s report, has now relaxedconsiderably. &apos; Special measures are under1 consideration forsimplifying control measures without unduly impairing theirefficacy, and for political reasons every effort is being made toavoid friction on this subject.HUNGARY.14-     The negotiations for the import quotas provided for by the rationing Agreement have been concluded.   Various requests for supplementary quotas for re-armament purposes have, however,been left over for subsequent discussion.

SPAIN AND PORTUGAL15.     Active steps are being taken to complete the measures necessary to give effect to the decision of the Minister ofEconomic Warfare and the French Minister of Blockade at their meeting on April 5th and 6th that Spain and Portugal musthenceforth be treated as adjacent neutrals.PORTUGALl6.     It was decided recently to make a fresh approach to thesubject of a War Trade Agreement with Portugal, the&apos;negotiationsfor which have been in suspense owing to the unsatisfactoryreaction of the Portuguese Government to our first proposals.Mr, D. Eccles of the Southern Section has been sent to Lisbonto explore the situation locally under the guidance of His MajestyAmbassador, and to consider what new proposals should be laidbefore the Portuguese Government.    He took with him a list of points which it would be desirable to cover if possible, including provision for means of countering the use of air services viaPortugal for contraband and enemy exports.    The Ambassador,returning from leave, and Mr. Eccles, flew to Lisbon on April 30th17.      It is desired to conclude with Portugal independently of,and if possible in anticipation of, the negotiations for a war trade Agreement, a separate agreement on the trade in U.K. coal-for Portugal and supplies from Portugal of pitwood and pit props.As a result of earlier discussions in Lisbon, the portuguese government formulated definite proposals on March 21st,   TheDepartments concerned in London have since been concerting counterproposals, which it is hoped to communicate to the portuguese government in the immediate future.    It is proposed to offerPortugal coal at the rate of 1+0,000  tons a month in considerationof our being assured of a stated quantity of pitwood and props,Doth coal and timber to be carried up to agreed amounts in portuguese bottoms, the remainder in British ships or neutral ships under charter to His Majesty&apos;s Government.The/

The negotiations are likely to be difficult, as the Portugueseasked for not less than 1,000,000 tons of coal per annum, and also for other reasons.18. Though the Patrols off the Atlantic coast of Spain and.Portugal are necessarily limited,  one vessel entering Lisbonhas already &quot;been diverted to Casablanca and it is hoped thatsuch occasional diversions will provide a strong bargainingweapon in negotiations with shipping companies.      The aim ofsuch negotiations would be to induce ships proceeding from the americas to the Iberian peninsula to call at Dakar, Casablanca,Bermuda or Kingston.19. Instructions have been drafted for despatch to Bermudaand to Kingston so that if it were decided to establish, basesthere the local authorities could begin to operate without delay.20. Instructions far the operation of the Navicert systemhave reached Lisbon and Madrid and the system can be introducedthere at short notice.21. United Kingdom and Dominion Export Licencing authoritieshave been asked to include Spain and Portugal in their list ofdangerous destinations.1 -    CONTRABAND CONTROLStatistics22, During the week ending Lj.th May, 83 new ships were dealtwith,      In 50 cases advance copies of manifests of cargoes were received and considered before the ship&apos;s arrival at contraband control Bases, and in 27 such cases the ships concerned were released by the Committee subject to the formal checking of theoriginal manifests on their arrival at the Control Bases.23. About 9,737 tons of goods were directed to be seized.24, 13 ships were allowed to carry forward cargo under Hold-Back guarantees.25. The number of ships at United Kingdom Control Basesdeclined/

declined from 68 at the end of the pr-svious week to 54 at theend of last week and is falling to normal.     The average periodof detention of the 40 inward-bound- ships which left UnitedKingdom Contraband Oor-trol Bases during the week was 7*5 days.26. Navicert applications for the week-ending 4th Mav werei860.      In the month of April 10,307 applications were received as against 9,279 in January, lo,228 in February and 13,002 inMarch..      The total number of applications received to date is51,502 of which 41,375 have been granted.General Contraband questions27. As a result of a despatch from Rotterdam which showed that animal fats were being exported from Holland into Belgium,-where they were declared in transit for Switzerland, but actuallyexported to Germany, it has been aecided to suspend the issue ofNavicerts for shipments of fats to Holland.28. Vve have refused &quot;to yield to Dutch protests against the seizure of a number of consignments to A.N.I.C. or to private firms which it had been agreed in the War Trade Agreement shouldbe treated as consignments to A.N,T.C.29. No special obstacles are now being put in the way ofshipping to the Low Countries except in the case of Norwegianships.3u. Applications for Navicerts for the Baltic States are nowbeing put forward by their Legations with the suggestion thatthe goods should be sent via the Black Sea and U.S.S.R.      As weare receiving considerable quantities of flax and flax-seeds fromthese states by this route it has been decided to grant Navicertsfor goods going via the Black Sea, as an experiment and withprecautions to ensure safe arrivals31. The Swedish Government has put forward a proposal forthe experimental despatch of two ships one to the U.S.A, andback, and one to the United Kingdom and back.      a reply has beengiven/

given that the proposal is favourably regarded, by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and that facilities will be given.32. Further developments with regard to the Petsamo trafficare the request of the Ford Company to ship their products to finland via Petsamo and enquiries as to the possibility ofshipping under Havicert to the Baltic states by this route.33, The Italian s.s. &quot;Lucifero&quot; carrying 5?500 tons ofrubricating oil, after being detained at Gibraltar and Maltafor a month by reason of evidence which would under normal circumstances have moved the Contraband Committee to seize,has now,  out of regard to the political situation, been released.BNBMY SXPUPT3Work of the Committee34. The Committee met six times this week.      It reviewed8 ships, releasing 3 (iri one case subject to enquiries as tocertain items of cargo), ordering 1 to he detained, and directingthat items should be placed in Prize in 3 cases.35. in the remaining case, it was reported to the Committeethat certain consignments of arras for the Brazilian Governmenthad been shipped from Genoa, without permission having beenobtained.     The Committee had previously, in February, grantedan application made by the Brazilian Government for the free passage of the same ship with war material of German origin fromGenoa to Brazil - this consignment having been stated to be thef finally one.36. In the present case, the Brazilian Government havingexpressed their regret that the shipment had gone forward without permission through the fault of their Consul at Genoa, who hadbeen dismissed in consequence, the Committee agreed to the exemption of the goods in question, while making it clearly understood that no further goods would be exempted without fullinvestigation and conclusive proof that payment had been made.37* The Committee considered 106 specific applications for exemption/

exemption, granting 82, refusing 9 and deferring considerationof 15, in addition to 125 applications treated summarily&quot;, ofwhich 52 were granted and 73 refused.38. The Dutch have now agreed that goods of Dutch or other neutral origin consigned from Holland to the Netherlands IndiesGovernment should he covered by omnibus Certificates of Origin.Goods of German origin   to the same consignee will he thesubject of applications for export passes.
