Comprehensive instructions completing and co-rdinating what had already been laid down were embodied in a despatcho Madrid of June 1st.     They confirmed previous decisions not tonterfere with ships trading betv/een Spanish mainland ports.     Allontrol of ships both ways between Spain and her overseas possessionss to be suspended for the time being.      Spanish ships on other routes to be dealt with leniently and expeditiously, but without sacrifice-icing the principle of contraband and enemy exports control.     The
Spanish Government, if they revert to the question of control, are tche-encouraged to. avail.,themselves of the various means hy which theycan themselves reduce the danger of delay to shipping, notably by afull use of navicerts and by carrying certificates of-origin oh&apos;allvoyages except between mainland ports.     Future-, arrangements for theapplication of control to Spain must depend on: thjSf&amp;eyelopment pf thesituation in the Mediterranean, and it. is not, therefore&apos;,:: proposed to&quot;embark on any general discussion with the Spanish authorities for thepresent.ITALY9. As stated in last week&apos;s report (para.6) negotiations in regardto contraband control v/ere broken off on May &apos; 27 th. This decision wtaken by Signor Mussolini personally, ostensibly on the ground thatthe Press in this country had attempted to make political capital cmof what should have been a purely administrative matter. It applieto all negotiations in progress, and covered both the discussions for the amendment of the Anglo-Italian Clearing Agreement (which had &quot;beeVirtually completed) as well as the proposals to place large ordersfor ships in Italy,10.    The Italian authorities are making difficulties about the issue&apos;of export licences for goods ordered or bought in Italy, even in caswhere we have supplied raw materials.     Appropriate steps are.beingtaken to prevent Italy from obtaining raw materials and other goodsmilitary importance from British and Allied sources.11. Future policy in regard to contraband control is under consideration .ROUMANIA12.    The Roumanian Government have informed H.M. Minister at-Bucharethat they do not approve the text of the rationing agreement initial: on May 11th in London, since they consider that its signature wouldmean a departure from strict neutrality.     They have, however,  accepthat the quotas agreed upon should come into force as from June 1st.Monsieur lordan,.. with whom the question has been further discussed london, has pointed out that&apos; the provisions in the initialled agree-ment are all ones v/hich His Majesty&apos;s Government could, in fact,, appunilaterally.     As, therefore, the quotas have been agreed by the Somanian Government, it has been decided to suggest to them that matters should be allowed to remain as they stand, the understandingbeing that the quotas are agreed and will be agreed in the same way for subsequent quarters, and that the Roumanian Government will con-tinue to observe the assurances contained in the letters which weresigned at the time of the initialling of the agreement.&apos;     It is belied that this solution will be acceptable to..the Roumanian, authofitieBULGARIA13. Negotiations with the Bulgarian Minister for a rationing agree-ment have made considerable progress and quotas have been settled foall the commodities concerned,, which the Bulgarian Minister has uncle&apos;taken to submit to his Government for approval.YUGOSLAVIAlh.    The quota for lubricating oil has now been closed,GRBECB15,    The Greek Government have expressed their warmest thanks for concessions..made by His Majesty1 s Government (see last weekly suffiiictf.regarding the amounts of certain commodities which may be exportedGermany/
Germany under List A of the War Trade Agreement,      They state, how-c-ver,  that the German Economic Delegation are in a truculent mood andhave asked Greece to supply as much as 50,000 tons of chrome to Ger-rnany.     The Greek Government have pointed out that they would he in amuch better position to resist German demands if His Majesty&apos;s Govern-msht could increase their purchases of Greek tobacco from  500,000 to 2 million.      This possibility is being examined.SOVIET RUSSIAId.    The French authorities have now taken a decision regarding theSoviet vessels &quot;Seieiiga&quot; and &quot;Vladimir Mayakovsky&quot;, which were inter-copted on their way to Vladivostock by British warships some monthsana, and were, subsequently&apos; handed over to the French to be dealt withby the French Prize Courts.     The French Government have now boughtthe cargo- of wolfram, antimony and tin on board the &quot;Selenga&quot; from theChinese owners of these consignments, and have &quot;released the .ship with-he. consignments of coffee on board.      The French authorities have also decided to release the &quot;Vladimir Mayakovsky&quot; with her cargo of copper,though the molybdenum on board will be unloaded in Siberia and will bethe object of some later arrangement.      The French authorities seemsatisfied that the cargoes will not reach Germany.APGHANIS TAN &apos; -      - -17.    The Afghan Government state that,they have sold 800 tons of cottonto the-Germans, who are pressing for all available supplies of Afghanwool and cotton;    the Afghan Government would, however, much prefer to dispose of their wool and cotton&apos;elsewhere, and they; have made an offer to His Majesty&apos;s Government of 12,000 tons of wool and 12,000 cons ofcotton.     As regards the wool, the Afghan Government suggest that theGovernment&apos;of India should send an expert to Afghanistan to inspectsamples and arrange prices.     The price of the cotton, they suggest,should be the Liverpool prices of the 30th January.IRAN &apos;     : : : :. ..&apos; .18.   The Iranian Government have been informed that we are prepared to buy 5,000 tons of Iranian wool if available in satisfactory qualitiesat prices based on our wool control schedule.     An expert has beensent by air to Tehran to explain questions connected with price andgrading.Contraband and Enemy Exports ControlSTATISTICSA. CONTRABAND CONTROL &apos;19.   During the- week ending 1st June the number of new ships dealtwith by the Contraband Committee dwindled further to-.21.     19. advancecopies of Manifests of cargoes. were- received and considered before theship&apos;s arrival at Contraband Control bases, and in 10 cases the shipsconcerned were released by the Committee, subject to the formal check-ing of the original manifests on their.arrival at the Control Bases.20.    5 ships were allowed to carry forward cargo- under hold-backguarantees.21. About 1,066 tons of goods were seized and in addition 11,923 tonsof cargo for Denmark were placed in prize..22.    5,180 tons of goods were released from seizure in the past fort-night.I23.   Navicert applications for the week totalled 765 as against a weekly/
- h -weekly average for May of 1,300. During the week 7 fully Navicertedships were released.2h. The total number of applications received during successive monthsince the commencement of the Navicert system has been as follows: -December, 7,l4h7;    January,  9,279;   February, 10,228;    March, 13,002;April, 10,307;    May, 5,237.25. About 855^ of the Navicert applications made since the inauguraticiof the system have been granted.B-  SKBKT EXPORTS CONTROL26. The Committee met five times this week. It reviewedreleasing 7, and directing that the items should be placed the other h cases.27.    The Committee considered hli applications for exemption, granting36, refusing h, and deferring consideration of h.      29 applications were treated summarily, of which 27 were granted and 2 refused.GENERAL CONTRABAND QUESTIONS28.    In spite of the breakdown of the war trade negotiations with Ita&apos;the immunity from interception and diversion accorded to Italian andU.S.A. ships in the Mediterranean has not yet been withdrawn.29.,.. staff engaged at our Embassy and Consulates at Rome, for economl&amp;^r&amp;rW is being disbanded and evacuated and the archives destroyed and ho further communication is being made from this Ministry to the.2posts regarding the current work of control.30.    The Contraband Committee has authorised the release of all con-signments whether seized or detained, which were in Italian ports anddestined for countries other than Italy.31.    Cargo originally destined for Holland or Belgium and carried invessels now at British ports or bases is being disposed of as followsPrivately owned goods are being requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping.      If the Supply departments so desire,  they take over the goodsOtherwise,  the Netherlands or the Belgium Committee either arrange fosale in this country, the proceeds going Into a blocked account, or else for release of the goods, against valued documents of title,regards state-owned goods - which in fact consist almost entirely of foodstuffs - the British Government has undertaken to take deliveryan agreed price.32. An Agreement has been reached with the Swedes regarding the dipposal of cargo of Swedish ships in British or French ports. Perishable cargo may he sold on the market. All other cargo, the proper-tin which has passed to the Swedish importers, will,if suitable to united Kingdom requirements,be purchased by His Majesty&apos;s government if unsuitable for United Kingdom requirements, the cargo- will be solon the best market, a United Kingdom import licence being granted ifnecessary.33.    By arrangement with the Admiralty the Swedish Naval auxiliary&quot;Patricia&quot; will sail from Cork&quot;to Gothenburg, with an escort of Swedestroyers.     A certain amount of cargo for Sweden!s being sent frothis country to Cork for transhipment to this vessel.GENERAL ENEMY EXPORT QUESTIONS3h.    We have asked the Swedes to try to persuade Germany to allow- Swed^11 ships,in Prize ii
Swedish Exports to cross Germany in sealed waggons with Swedish attend-antSj and to persuade the U.S.A. and South American States to allowc^go inspection on unloading,35.    The Enemy Exports Committee considered in principle a form ofGerman export trade which had been brought to its attention In a spec-ific case the previous week: viz. where Germany was obliged to furnishBulgaria with free currency, a German firm purchased material from america which was shipped to Bulgaria.      The Committee thought that onlegal grounds it would be proper to place such a consignment in Prize.They recognised that political considerations would have to be takeninto account,  though it appeared to them less likely that such consid-considerations would be of importance in a case of this kind where the goods were purchased hy a German in Germany than in the case of goods con-signed to Europe by an American firm alleged to be under German control..36.    The Committee requested the Chairman in dealing with the Lift Vansand Baggage of German refugees in Italian ports to act on the principlethat, except where there were circumstances of suspicion, an ExportPass should be granted.37.    The Committee considered 5 oases in which Consuls asked for instructions as to the issuing of Certificates of Origin.     Theserequests came principally from Consuls in Italy and the Committeemaintained their previous policy of directing the granting of Certif-icates, except where there was an absolutely clear case for refusal.
