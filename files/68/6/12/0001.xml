(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETg.P.(R) (40)15229th April, 1940..WAR   cabinet food SITUATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOMSEVENTH REPORT submitted by the Minister of Food for themonth of March, 1940, incorporating the report on home production for the same period prepared by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries in conjunction with the Secretary of State for Scotland.W.Copy No.2z.Ministry of Fooda S.W.I.

h   In the forecasts there given for April, May and June, no account has beentaken of possible losses at sea.   As shipping tonnage has not yet beenarranged for a large part of June, the predictions for that month must beregarded as less reliable than those for April and May.MINISTRY OF FOODREPORT FOR MARCH, 1940.SUPPLY. CONSUMPTION. STOCKS AND prices, STOCKS OF FOODSTUFFS - GENERAL note the stock position of the main foodstuffs is shown in the appendix.*Stocks are for the most part satisfactory.     The stocks of meat,bacon, butter, cheese and oilseeds were increased during March;   wheat and teastocks remained practically constant and stocks of sugar declined.Supplies of bacon and butter are seriously affedted by the invasion of Denmark;   imports of bacon will decline from 8,000 tons a Week to some4,400 tons, but this reduction is partially offset by an increase of approximately,000 tons in home production.     Present stocks of butter ill Gold store are equalto about 9-g- weeks&apos; consumption on an 8 oz. ration.     Imports of eggs have been largely reduced as a result of the invasion of Denmark and Norway, and if Dutchsupplies were cut off, the situation would become extremely difficult;    steps arebeing taken to find other sources of supply.Sugar continues in short supply.     The Ministry is submitting for theconsideration of the War Cabinet a proposal that an additional 50,000 tons offoreign sugar be purchased at once.     It is estimated that on the 1st October(by which time home-grown sugar beet will be ready for lifting) stocks will be&quot;below the danger point unless this purchase is made.Milk production is about Q% less than in the corresponding period oflast year.     The cutting off of supplies of condensed skim milk if Hollandwere to be occupied by Germany would be a serious loss to the poorer classes of consumers;   steps have been taken to increase home production:    supplies areavailable in America.     Fish supplies are greatly below normal, and the possibilityof obtaining increased supplies of imported fish is being examined.Stocks of cereal animal feeding stuffs are negligible and arecausing concern:    there may be difficulty in maintaining distribution at thepresent rate of two-thirds of normal.     It is hoped to build up stocks of oilcake.

during the summer months.     Oil seeds and nuts and vegetable and marine oilsare in a stronger position than in recent months.     With the arrival of thenew season&apos;s crop of whale oil at the end of May, the stock will be increasedto some 350,000 tons, or 50,000 tons more than at the outbreak of war.The following paragraphs give a more detailed account of important commodities.2. WHEATTotal stocks in country 2,092,000 tonsBstimated weekly consumption 130,000     &quot;Reserve stocks of wheat at the end of March equalled 12.2 weeks&apos; supply.The failure to implement the War Cabinet1 s instruction that a 13 weeks1 reserve for human consumption (i.e3 1,530,000 tons) should be accumulated by that date, isdue to shipping delays, sinkings and the allocation of imported wheat and anadditional supply of home-grown wheat for livestock.     Imports during April-June,plus the proportion of the home crop likely to be available for human use, are now estimated at about 135,000 tons in excess of consumption.     If this estimate is realised stocks at the end of June will&apos;be sufficient for about 13-g- weeks&apos; supply at the current rate of consumption0     There will be practically no home cropavailable from July to September, but the outlook for those months may beconsidered satisfactory.3. ANIMAL FEEDING-STUFFSMaize Barley Oilcake, o.......    Tons.............Total stocks in country 76,000        316,000 12,000Estimated weekly consumption        50,000 35,000 27,000Owing to the shortage of cereal feeds it was considered necessary to allocate 40,000 tons of French wheat for feeding livestock, of which 20,000 tonsere released in March,     Taking this into account, supplies in the first threemonths of 1940 were just sufficient to implement the undertaking to allocate todistributors not less than two-thirds of the normal quantities of imported cerealfeeding-stuffs.     In addition, the quantity of home-grown wheat that may be soldor the feeding of livestock was increased from the 1st March from 33^6 to 50$* the quantity sold off farms.Stocks of cereal feeds continue to be negligible and forecasts ofrivals indicate that it will be difficult to maintain distribution in April-une at the present rate of Q&amp;% of normal.     Supplies of feeding-stuffs consigned&apos;0 any Scandinavian country are being diverted to Britain, but the extent to which

There was an improved supply of oilcake during March but inadequatestocks have increased the difficulty of organising distribution.     It is hopedthat during the summer months, when oilcake consumption is small, stocks will be built up.4. SugarTotal stocks in country 364,000 tons estimated weekly consumption 36,600   &quot;Stocks of sugar have been falling since the completion of the home production season in January.     Bulk stocks (i.e. stocks excluding Retailers&apos;,Wholesalers&apos; and Manufacturing stocks) at the end of March (290,000 tons)represented only 8 weeks&apos; supply on the present ration basis.     A substantial increase in stocks is expected during April-June, but this improvement is unlikely to be maintained since shipments will decline due to seasonal factors in succeeding months, and stocks on 1st October are expected to be even lower than on 30th March,     The home crop of sugar beet will, however, then be ready for lifting.The seriousness of the sugar supply position Is set forth in a speoial memorandum to the Cabinet,Sales of sugar by refineries suggest that the full ration is beingtaken up in nearly all cases.     In Maroh sales were ,only 5f0 below estimated requirements, including domestic, manufacturing and export.5. MEATTotal stocks in country 164,000 tons (imported only)Estimated weekly consumption 20,000   &quot;     (     11 &quot;   )The principal difficulty experienced during the first few weeks of meat rationing, which commenced on 11th March, was that sales of pork by porkbutchers were seriously affected by consumers having deposited their meat couponswith general butchers.     This problem has been solved temporarily by thede-rationing of pork.It is evident that meat coupons are not being utilised to their full extent.     On the basis of sales during the first four weeks of rationing,the weight of meat purchased represented only 80=5 of the quantity obtainable onavailable ooupons (i.e, 1,4 lbs. as compared with the ration of 1.75 lbs. per head).    Despite the Government&apos;s meat subsidy, estimated at about  20 million per year, prices are higher than a considerable proportion of the populationcan afford to pay. 3

The estimated civilian consumption of meat during April-June 1939 and1940 follows:Total Civilian Consumption   Of which % home-killedApril-June &apos;39April-June &apos;40(Thousand tons)Beef and VealMutton and lambporkOffal29914846442211504844April-June &apos;3949.838.584.863,6AprilJune &apos;4064.830.785,461.4Total53746350.854.8In April and May home-killed supplies are expected to show some reduction, but arrivals of imported supplies are estimated at more thansufficient to meet the consequential increase in the demand for imported meat.The provision of increased space for the storage of frozen meat may present difficulties if May and June stocks prove to he as high as at present estimated.61 BACON AND HAM     &apos;40,000 tons,500   &quot;Total stocks in countryEstimated weekly consumption .The occupation of Denmark will have a marked effeOt on supplies Of&quot;bacon, since approximately 4A% of our imports came from that source during thethree months January-March 1940.     In recent months the weekly rate of importsfrom all Oountries was about 8,000 tons, hut it is now estimated that importswill decline immediately to ahout 4,400 tons a week.     Should Dutch suppliesalso &quot;be cut off a further reduotion of 250 tons a week must he expected.The quantity of &quot;bacon produced at home has increased since theheginning of February;   the average weekly rate of production in March 1940Iibeing 2,500 tons compared with ahout 1,500 tons per week in January.[. MILKMilk production in March 1940 declined by nearly 7 million gallonsIr 7.9$ compared with the same month in 1939.     The relative decreases inanuary and February 1940 were 8*7% and 8,8% respectively.Sales of liquid milk in March showed a decrease of only 1.5^5-compared with March 1939 and the hulk of the decreased production has &quot;been reflected in manufactured products,     The more important changes in the quantitiesfsed &quot;by manufacturers are indicated &quot;below;-

Disposal of Manufactured MilkMarch 1940.      March 1939.ButterCheeseMilliongallons2.252.03Condensed milk for export 0.15Milliongallons4.724.020.70Decrease ofMarch 1940 onMarch 1959Per cent.52.349.578.6Approval has recently &quot;been given to the subsidising of condensed milk&quot;or the export trade in order that our position in export markets may he maintained,,If Holland is occupied by Germany the loss of supplies of skimmedondensed milk will be serious.     The total consumption of this product isquivalent to 125,000 tons per annum, of which home production is expected torovide this year 60^S and practically all the remainder comes from Holland.   Inew of the necessity for increasing the price of liquid milk in a few weeks&apos;ime the loss of Butch supplies of skimmed condensed milk would have a seriousTect on the cost of living in a large number of poorer households where theonsumption of liquid milk is normally almost negligible.. BUTTERTotal stocks in country 73,000 tons estimated weekly consumption        6,500     11The invasion of Denmark has necessitated a complete review of thetter supply position.     Whereas, prior to 9th April, efforts were &quot;being made to^uce imports owing to the large stocks in hand, it will now he necessary tonsider a reduction in the ration as soon as stocks are reduced from theiresent peak level.   It is estimated that normal Empire and South American supplies,&quot;pplemented by normal imports from Holland will with the existing stocks heficient to provide a 4 oz. ration for another year.   Should Dutch supplies heoff, a 4 oz. ration could still he maintained for a considerable time, theition depending upon the extent of the production in the Dominions.   Presentcold stored stocks are sufficient to provide for about 9g- weeks&apos; consumption onsn eight ounce ration or 12-g- weeks1 consumption if the domestic ration is reduced*P four ounces,9* MARGARINEIt is not yet possible to assess the full effeot on margarine salesIII the increase in the butter ration to 8 ozs. as from 25th March.   Margarine salesduring the four weeks ended 16th March averaged 6,600 tons a week   sales in April5.

are expected to decline by 500 tons per week.10. CHEESETotal stocks in country 21,000 tons estimated weekly consumption 4,000     &quot;Although a planned decrease in imports of non-Empire cheese isexpected to take place during the three months April-June, the normal seasonalexpansion in homo production should be sufficient to provide for normalconsumption and stocks.The Import Prohibition Order made in March, has effected a deductionin the prices paid for Canadian cheese and values have fallen from 97/- to 80/&apos;-per cwt. c. i,f.   No official reply to the Ministry^ s offer to make a hulkpurchase of Ganedian cheese has yet been received.11. EGGSIt is estimated that egg production in the United Kingdom during thefirst quarter of this year declined by 15% from the same months of 1939.   Thefall in production was due to severe weather conditions as well as to a reductionin the size of flocks following the shortage of feeding-stuffs.   Supplies of imported eggs for the same periods show a decline of approximately 4%.    Sincethe heginning of the year prices have been considerably above those ruling in theearly months of 1939 and, contrary to the normal trend, increased -until the endof February.     There was then a sharp fall in prices, during March.The invasion of Denmark and Norway will result in a serious diminutionin supplies of eggs since, - in 1939, nearly half our imports came from scandinavia and the Baltic countries,     A cessation of imports from these countries is of less consequence during the spring months when home production reaches itsseasonal maximum, but supplies during the latter half of the year are expected tobe seriously short.     Should Holland become involved in the war, a further declinein supply may occur which, since Holland accounts for a quarter of the totalimports of eggs, would render the position extremely difficult.   New sources ofsupply are being sought and the Treasury has approved an offer &quot;being made for aconsiderable quantity of preserved eggs from Canada.12*   OILSEEDS AND NUTS;   VEGETABLE AND MARINE OILSOilseeds        Vegetable        T/haleand Nuts Oil Oil.............. tons ............Total stocks in country 173,000        56,000 220,000Estimated weekly consumption     31,000        13,500 4,000

An increase in imports of certain types of oilseeds, together withrestrictions imposed on manufacturers have resulted in a stronger stock position.It is estimated that at the end of April stocks of oilseeds and oils will heequivalent to 9g- weeks1 supply of hard oils, lOg- weeks&apos; consumption of soft oils and 8 weeks&apos; for linseed oil.The hulk of the new season&apos;s crop of whale oil is expected to arriveby the end of May and the stock at that date is estimated at 350,000 tons, or50,000 tons more than at the outbreak of war.    At the present rate of consumption this represents 1-1 years&apos; supply.     Although some increase in theuse of whale oil as a substitute for certain vegetable oils has been attempted,a rapid expansion of substitution is unlikely owing to the limitations of thehydrogenating plant in this country.    An appreciable quantity of crude whale oilis sent from Britain to Holland for hardening and return and, should Holland beinvaded, this trade may cease.     Some expansion of the hardening plants in britain is being carried out, but although initial difficulties in getting steel have been overcome, the new Government plant will not be available until the end of 1940.13. FISHSupplies of fish were 43$ below normal during February.     Whilstimproving weather conditions in March resulted in some increase in supplies, it isexpected that landings during the next three months will decline slightly.Trawlers are still being requisitioned and those that are being released are ofthe older and less efficient types.     The possibility of inoreasing the imports offish, including frozen fresh fish, is being examined.     Total supplies, however,will in any case be well below normal.14. TEATotal stocks in country 191 million lbs.Estimated weekly consumption 10.5 million lbs.Arrangements have been completed to import into this country in thenext twelve months sufficient tea to meet our consumption requirements and tomaintain the re-export trade at a normal level.   Supplies will be drawn from empire countries only.15. DRIED FRUITReports are being received which indicate that consumption of driedI fruit is inoreasing as a result of the advertising campaign.     Stocks in handand afloat are more than ample to meet requirements until the end of Augustwithout allowing for a considerable part of the new crop of Australian fruit which7.

is expeoted to arrive &quot;before that date.16. FOOD prices the Ministry of Labour&apos;s Index Number of food prices fell by 3 pointsbetween March 1st and April 1st.     The whole of this fall was due to the seasonal decline of Id eaoh for eggs, a decline which had been retarded by the cold weather earlier in the year.     Potatoes increased in price by nearly fd.per 71b., as a result of higher Maximum Prices as the season advanced, and fishprioes rose by about 4 per cent.Before May 1, egg prices are likely to have risen seasonably in price,and the increase will be sharper than usual owing to the cessation of Danishsupplies.     On the other hand the index for milk should be slightly lower, owingto the seasonal fall in the minimum price for towns with over 25,000 populationoutside the South-Eastern region, and to a seasonal fall in the price of home-produced cheese.     On balance there is not likely to be any substantial change,but the Ministry is oonoemed at the present high cost of living for the people who are not benefitting from war-time employment.

By the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in conjunction with theSecretary of State for Scotland,,)(16th April, 1940.)Ploughing up campaign in England and Wales the acreage scheduled by County committees for ploughing up for cropping this year has now reached ahout 1,493,000acres.     The acreage actually ploughed by April 15th was 1,453,000 acres.In Scotland notices of intention to plough cover 275,000 acres of old grassland under the subsidy scheme0     The net increase in thetillage area expected is 200.,000 acres of which 194,000 acres had beenploughed by April 15th.In Northern Ireland applications for grants cover 255,000 acres and 250,000 acres have been ploughed.The above figures for acreage actually ploughed up include, inGreat Britain, some land actually ploughed up before the outbreak of war.On the &quot;basis of the above figures and of a sample of occupiers&apos;returns for March 4th and special enquiries relating to sugar beet and potatoes, it may now be estimated that the agricultural acreage in theUnited Kingdom on June 4th next will roughly conform to the distributionshown in the following table:-

Apart from the rather large increase of hare fallow, these seem tobe satisfactory figures, having regard to various adverse circumstancesduring the winter.     These circumstances are, however, likely to affectthe prospective crop yields.     Except perhaps in the case of wheat (muchof which has been severely damaged) it is possible that very favourable weather during the next few months might produce yields above normal;    Itis more likely, however, that yields will be below normal, because (a)the unusually cold and wet winter has caused a serious setback; (b) farmtasks are 6ongested this spring; (c) the newly ploughed acreage is likelyto yield less than the old arable acreage and (d) there is a shortage,either actual or prospective, of labour of sufficient skill.Machinery and ImplementsThe Ford Motor Company are keeping well up to their satisfactoryprogramme of 100 tractors a day.     Sales of Fordson tractors in the domestic market in the past nine- months have been four times greater thana year previously.     Now that the spring rush of orders is over aGovernment reserve to meet harvest and autumn ploughing requirements willbe built up.Seeds and FertilisersCereal seed supplies for- the land remaining to be sown are adequatebut there have been delays (not likely to be serious) in the supplies of seed potatoes.     Arrangements are being made to safeguard sugar beet seedsupplies for 1941 by measures taken this season and the same applies towinter beans for seed.     Agreement has been reached between the national farmers&apos; Union and the seed trade for minimum prices for the 1940 seedharvest for certain fodder and vegetable crops.     The possibility of growingin Kenya, Tanganyika, Palestine and Cyprus certain vegetable seeds hithertoobtained from Central Europe is being explored.     The seed barley purchased by the Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland for the greatly increasedacreage is in course of distribution.So far all demands for sulphate of ammonia have been met, and only temporary or local shortages, mainly due to shipping difficulties and an earlier than usual demand, have occurred in respect of other fertilisers.Revised transport priority arrangements for fertilisers are particularlylikely to benefit parts of Scotland.

Man power the extra labour demand anticipated by County Committees in Englandand Wales in order to deal with the increased production amounts to a further90 - 100,000 regular workers and a varying number of casual workers reaching80,000 in September.     In Scotland a peak requirement of 17,000 casualworkers in the autann. is expected.     The demand for additional regularworkers may ho estimated a  2-3,000.The following steps are being taken:    authority has been given toWar Agricultural Executive Committees to organise mobile gangs of workers;the War Department have been asked to release men on agricultural furloughand supply soldier labour for seasonal work;   the proposals for using boylabour have reached an advanced stage;    and the recruiting campaign for theWomen&apos;s Auxiliary Force for seasonal work has been started,The few remaining releases from the Army which have been sanctionedwill shortly be exhausted but proposals are under consideration forreleasing agricultural workers of low medical category or in cases wherecircumstances have materially changed since the outbreak of war0Postponements are likely to be granted to 80 or 90 per cent, of applicants for postponement among those registered in February and March.     In Scotland,however, a smaller percentage of postponements seem likely.     Proposals are under consideration for raising the age of reservation for certainunimportant classes of horticultural workers and workers with poultry.The available Women&apos;s Land Army volunteers nob already in fa:?memployment are now being rapidly absorbed and the recruiting of newvolunteers has begun once more.It must be recognised that the measures described above will not besufficient to maintain the existing labour force, still less   to augmentit.     The shortage of regular skilled labour will necessarily impose seriouslimitations on the future food production programme.Feeding StuffsSomewhart fewer complaints have been received during the past monthof serious shortage of feeding stuffs, although an appreciable deficiency ofsupplies of cotton seed cake, and a few other classes of feeding stuffs, isreported from some areas.

Good progress has &quot;been made with the proposals for instituting standardcompound feeding stuffs and standard mixtures of cereal meals and grain atprescribed maximum prices.     It is also intended to limit the production ofcompounds and mixed meals and thus to ensure the sale of more &quot;straight&quot;feeding stuffs, for which there is an insistent demand by farmers.     Releasesof feeding stuffs have been made to meet local shortages due to specialcircumstances.LivestockThe adjustments made during March in the prices of fat cowsj bulls andcalves have given general satisfaction.     Discussions have taken place betweenthe Farmers1 Unions, the Agricultural Departments and the Ministry of Foodabout the prices and methods of selling pigs.March 4th occupiers&apos; returns indicate that the decline in numbers of livestock has been less serious than might have been expected from feedingdifficulties during the winter.     There is, however, a marked decline in thenumber or young pigs, which will adversely affect future supplies.Milk production the following are the figures for the United Kingdom in millions ofgallons:-Liquid Manufacturing TotalMarch, 1940 73.6 19.0 92,6February, 1940 68.7 12.7 81.4March, 1939 74.6 25.3 99.9The decline in liquid consumption since March, 1939, shown above, was mainly due to reduced- consumption in schools, which was affected by Easterholidays and other factors.      Excluding milk in schools, liquid consumption inEngland and Wales after a decline in the first few months of the war, is nowslightly higher than, a year ago.     This is in continuation of a trend whichhas operated for some years.     The increased liquid consumption in conjunctionwith higher prices for milk for manufacturing has made it possible to implement the guarantee to farmers of pool prices higher by 2^d. per gallon than a yearagQj at a cost to the Exchequer which may not exceed l^d.

Since the last reports three outbreaks of foot and mouth diseasehave led to the slaughter of 279 head of stock, of which 61 have beensalvaged for human consumption.     The swine fever figure still remainshigh and 330 outbreaks have been confirmed since the last report, butthe position has improved in parts of the eastern counties.
