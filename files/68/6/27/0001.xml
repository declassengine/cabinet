air attack.      In addition, a supply yf posters has been distributed to these authorities to be held ready to be displayed on receiptof instructions from the Government.      These posters contain incondensed and striking form advice to the public on such questions as taking cover, anti-gas and fire precautions.Additional filters for respirators.7.     A new type of anti-smoke filter for Civilian and CivilianDuty respirators has been devised.      This filter will provide as high a standard of protection against the particulate or smokegases as is given by the Service respirator.      The new filter willhe incorporated in future production of containers by theDepartment;    but to provide the improved protection for existingcontainers it has also been ma eta in the form of a small extensionpiece which can be attached to the existing container.      Theseextensions, known as &quot;Contex&quot;, are now being issued in substantial numbers to local authorities, who will in due course arrange forthem to be added to the respirators in the possession of the public.On 11th May, supplies totalled about 18-g- millions and production isat the rate of 2 millions a week.      Although local authoritieshave already been warned to make the necessary arrangements,publicity will not be given to the matter until May 20th.Other Civil Defence Supplies.8.     At the outbreak of war it was decided to-create a reserve ofcertain drugs and medical stores (quinine, opium, catgut, etc.).These reserves are now available in some cases, and in others thesupply position has been safeguarded.9.     Five complete sets of X-ray equipment have arrived from theUnited States of America as a gift from the American Red Cross andthe Civilian Aid Incorporated, and have been allocated to selectedHospitals.  ^ gcjikgn of persons living near aerodromes.10.      Regional Commissioners have for some time,  in sonsultation

with the Regional representatives of the Ministry of Health andwith the Chief Constables concerned, been considering plans fordealing with the removal of the population from the close proximityof aerodromes,     A scheme has now been drawn up and communicatedto the Regional Commissioners and by the Ministry of Health to itsSenior Regional Officers and also to Chief Constables, whereby,persons living within 1,000 yards Of certain target aerodromescould, if necessary, be advised to disperse from their homes untilthe attack had finished.      It is contemplated that this would, atany rate in the first instance, be a temporary dispersal and wouldnot involve permanent billeting.     The plans are being kept secretso as not to disclose the identity of the aerodromes concerned.Emergency Fire Measures.11.      A scheme has recently been announced to local Fire authorities under which parties of selected householders will be trained in theuse of stirrup hand pumps, of ^vhich 50,000 will shortly be availablefor distribution.Evacuation.12.     Although plans and detailed timetables have been prepared forthe evacuation of 670,000 children in England and Wales and 133,-400^in Scotland, only 114,000 in England and Wales and 25,000 inScotland have been registered.      As it is likely that the numberswhu would wish to be evacuated in the event of air raids would bemuch greater than the registered numbers, it has been decided thatthe existing plans should be maintained without alteration.13.     It has also been decided to increase the billeting allowancespayable to householders in respect of older children.      As from theend of May the allowances will be at the rate of 10/6 a week forall children between 10 and.14 years of age, 12/6 for all childrenbetween 14 and 16 years of age, and 15/- for all children over 16years.

Ministry of Home Security,Whitehall.140     Where billeting difficulties cannot be solved in any other way, local authorities are being encouraged to provide hostels asa means of affording relief to householders.     Steps are beingtaken to co-ordinate the resources of official and voluntary bodiesengaged in social welfare work among evacuated children, and the regional Staff of the Ministry of Health is being strengthened bythe addition of an officer in each Region with special experienceof such work.Transport,15,     The position as regards both goods and passenger traffic by rail and road continues tS be satisfactory.      In order to prepare for the contingency of a major diversion of shipping, steps havebeen taken, with marked success, to increase the rate at whichimports are passing through ports&quot; in the West and South-West.Otherwise the ports have been working normally,J.A.
