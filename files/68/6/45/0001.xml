(40) 165:June 8, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ANALYSIS OF GERMAN PROPAGANDA, MAY 17-31, 1940.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues, for their information, an analysis ofGerman propaganda for the period the 17th-31st May, which has beenprepared by the Department for Publicity in Enemy Countries.H.Foreign Office, June 8, 1940.THIS Analysis of, German Propaganda covers the period from the 17thto the 31st May, 1940.The arrangement follows lines similar to those of the previous Analyses.German propaganda is divided into a number of themes providing a basis for comparison.Firstly, a short summary is made of the major trends of propaganda during the past fortnight.A brief description is then given of each of these. In the margin beside the items are placed percentage figures showing their comparative importancein relation to the total propaganda directed to (1) the German home popula-tion; (2) Great Britain; (3) France; and (4) neutral countries. In bracketsafter each figure is shown the corresponding percentage for the previousfortnight.A table is then given summarising these percentages.The course of German propaganda during the fortnight under reviewhas naturally been dominated by the campaign in Flanders, from the piercingof the Maginot Line to the surrender of Belgium and the subsequent encircle-ment of the Allied Forces. Emphasis on military subjects as a whole hasincreased from 54% to 65% of the whole output. Social propaganda hascontinued to sink into the background and is being replaced by the conception of a revolutionary war. This spirit of revolution is becoming one of thedriving forces of German propaganda.The theme of French Weakness has doubled, while that of BritishBrutality has halved its importance. At the same time, however, there wasa notable increase towards the end of the fortnight in atrocity stories againstboth Great Britain and France. The accusation against France has been directed against the whole people and not merely against the Governmentand the Army. Attacks upon France have been particularly virulent in10813-11   [21387] b
propaganda to Germany. An entire number of a magazine containingpropaganda suggestions for the National Socialist Party was devoted to the evil deeds of France for the past thousand years.There has been a great increase in the theme that Britain wasexploiting France, and German front-line propaganda to the French hasconcentrated upon this point, together with emphasis upon the certainty ofa rapid German victory, appeals to surrender and assurances of goodtreatment.The order of importance of the principal lines of German propaganda during the current fortnight was :  1. Military Operations.2. German Strength (mainly military).3. British Weakness (mainly military).4. French Weakness (mainly military).5. British Brutality (mainly atrocities).1. German Strength.Germany, 21*% While the importance of this theme has undergone little alteration, there(2l%) has been a further concentration upon German military strength, which nowFrance&quot; 18% (13%)   occupies four-fifths of the total propaganda to all countries (compared withNeutrals, 17$% &apos;     two-thirds during the previous fortnight).(18%) The most important single item wras the superior strategy and leadership of Germany, ascribed directly to Hitler. &quot; German arms, sovereignly-directed by the strategic genius of the Fiihrer, are forging world history withbreath-taking speed.&quot; Goering stressed the military omniscience of theFiihrer, who had the unique advantage of having experienced the greatest ofall wars as a simple soldier. The execution of his brilliant plan was ripeningto the most brilliant victory of present times. The possession of the Fuhrerlent Germany a unique spiritual strength. There could be felt at work somemysterious weapon : its results were sensed rather than seen, and created a feeling that the advancing armies went forward in obedience to some dynamiclaw as final as the force of gravity. &quot; Well organised armies to-day carryout astonishing achievements; but only a nation morally unequalled, withthe richest cultural and political education, is capable of such giganticdeeds.&quot;Germany had strikingly demonstrated her superiority, when, for the first time, she met an &quot; equal adversary.&quot; This superiority was largely due to the supremacy of the German Air Force, especially to the action of the German. dive bomber, and to the co-operation of aircraft and tanks. Germany was taking the initiative and dictating operations, not only on the land and inthe air, but also upon the sea. Special reference was made to her &quot; enormousfleet &quot; of small torpedo boats.Much greater stress is now laid upon German Military Strength inwireless propaganda than in the press, owing to the increased repetition of official communiques.Next to military strength, though only one-tenth as important, was thesupport of Germany&apos;s friends, almost exclusively of Italy. The anniversary of the Rome-Berlin Pact was used to illustrate the &quot; fighting community &quot;of two young nations marching towrards the future, having the same ideals,the same interests and the same enemies. Germany and Italy were now anindissoluble community, around which the whole Europe of the future wouldrevolve. Other items were the decoration of Goering with the Order of theAnnunziata, Farinacci&apos;s statement that Italy&apos;s place was at the side of hitler&apos;s heroic Germany, pro-German demonstrations after Ciano&apos;s speech,and cheers for the Fuhrer in Naples and Venice. A certain amount ofindirect support wras drawn from the extensive quotation of the Italian press.Germany&apos;s economic strength was the only sub-theme other than military strength which has increased in importance. The blockade was said to have failed. Germany had resources to stand a ten-year war. An interestingstatement, repeated after the 29th May, asserted that the Reich would enter the second year of war with the greatest grain reserves in the history ofEurope. Germany would also derive great benefit from Norway and denmark, Holland, Belgium and Luxemburg.No other sub-themes were of any importance.
2. Military Operations.There was little change in the importance of this theme over the whole Germany. 26% (28%)period, and the peak attained after the invasion of the Low Countries was France,&apos;iSi&apos;%never equalled. Neutrals, 25%   ^Military subjects,  comprising  German  Military  Strength,  Military (23i%)Operations and Allied Military Weakness, occupied the following propor-tions of the whole of German propaganda (in brackets are shown thecorresponding figures for the previous fortnight) : To Germany. 63^% (54%).To Britain.&quot; 67%&quot; (52%).To France, 63^% (57%).To Neutrals. 65% (52%).The events to which the greatest importance was attached were : (a) The piercing of the Maginot Line on a 100 km. front (announced onthe 17th May);(&amp;) The piercing of the Dyle line (announced on the 17th May);(c) The destruction of the French 9th Army, the capture of Arras.Amiens and Abbeville and the reaching of the Channel Coast(announced on the 21st May). Special prominence was given tothe share of the German Air Force in this victorious drive. the communique was preceded bv, fanfares and followed by theplaying of &quot; Wir fahren gegeh Engelland &quot;;(d) The fall of Calais (announced on the 26th May);(e) The surrender of the King of the Belgians and his 500.000 men(announced on the 28th May);(/) The destruction of three warships and sixteen transports, and thedamaging of 31 other vessels by bombing (announced on the30th May).After the 21st May the thread running through all this type of propaganda was the inexorable tightening of the ring of lire and steel around the Allied Armies in the North. The main stress was laid throughout on the advance of German land forces, generally with the support of the air force.Of considerable, but much less importance, was the destruction of allied aircraft and the bombing of back areas. Stress was laid upon the destruc-tion of Allied shipping from the air, mainly of warships off Narvik andtransports in the Channel.As during the previous fortnight, the picture of Germany&apos;s militarysuccess was presented as an uninterrupted and irresistible advance. Anundercurrent which has run throughout is the inevitability of this success.She had revolutionised warfare, and her enemies could never overtake herfirst advantage.The striking technique of presentation, noted in the previous Analysis,continued to be developed. The folloAvihg scenes, given as examples of thevividness with which operations have been presented to the German public,were shown iri the weekly news reel released to the German cinemas on the25th May: (a) Companies  of parachute jumpers in the air over  Rotterdam,photographed by another parachutist;(6) Parachutists fighting in Rotterdam;(c) German tanks advancing into battle near Dinant;(d) Infantry crossing rivers under fire in rubber boats;(e) Attacks by German dive bombers.All these scenes were taken by members of the Propaganda Companies, whoare regarded as regular soldiers and not as journalists. The news reel itself was of record length, and steps were taken to ensure a rapid circulationamong small local cinemas. It is stated that an increased number of germans have been visiting the cinemas to see the news reel alone.[21387] B 2
3. Neutrals oppose Allies.Brifoh^il^^^V Decreased importance has been attached to the active opposition ofFranca!&apos;2% (1%)     neutral countries.   Most attention was paid to the attitude of Italy, to the neutrals, \\% (2% )   tone of the Italian press and to demonstrations against the Allies.   the rejection of Sir Stafford Cripps by Russia was also given considerableemphasis.    Towards the end of the fortnight attention was paid todemonstrations in Spain demanding the return of Gibraltar.4. British Weakness.Germany, 17% The decline in this theme in propaganda to France was balanced, in britain, 20% (W%) propaganda to that country, by a great increase of emphasis on FrenchFrance,&apos;14% (22%) Weakness. In propaganda for home consumption the importance of thisNeutrals, isj%       theme has considerably&apos; increased.There has been an increase of concentration on military weakness, which now occupies three-quarters of the theme. Britaiirs military weakness wasillustrated in the first place by her vulnerability to, and fear of, invasion.The parachute psychosis was described and fostered, especially in broadcastsby the German-operated &quot; New British Broadcasting Station.&quot; Theoccupation of the Channel Ports was treated as a mortal threat to the securityof England. Propaganda on the subject of invasion, however, was fed mostlyfrom the British and neutral press, and rarely by direct German statements.Britaiirs air inferiority was demonstrated by her failure to protect theembarkation of the B.E.F. at Dunkirk and by her frantic appeal for planesfrom the United States.The German advance had trapped in Flanders the best men and the bestmaterial of the British Army. Only broken remnants would return. Mr. DuffCooper&apos;s appeals for confidence were interpreted as cries of helplessness. the surrender of the Belgian Army was another proof of the uselessness of Britishhelp.Second to military weakness, though only one-sixth as important, wasBritain&apos;s economic weakness. The blockade against England had been intensified by Germany&apos;s occupation of Holland, Belgium and the ChannelCoast. Stress was laid in the first place upon the loss of food imports from denmark and Holland, of timber from Scandinavia and of iron and steel from Belgium. Food rationing had become more severe, and butter was soscarce that King George himself was compelled to eat margarine. In thesecond place, emphasis was laid on the future intensification of the blockade.England was blockaded from the Shetland Isles to Dover, and the port of London was already dead. The fall of the pound sterling continued to bea regular, though minor, topic.There was a considerable decrease of interest in British internal political weakness, which was illustrated mainly by reference to theEmergency Powers Act. Winston Churchill had overturned the BritishConstitution in two and a half hours. The Act was the final abandonment of the democracy which England pretended to be fighting to preserve. Therehad, however, been little real change. &quot; Democracy had only been clad in afew tattered rags. In fact, the dictatorship of the Conservative Party hadruled. Through the new law the last veils have fallen and an open dictator-ship is declared.&quot; Britain was trying to adopt the same machinery as germany, but without a spirit of community such as that existing inGermany.Both social weakness and Empire dissensions were neglected.5. French Weakness.Germany, 10% (3%) This theme has increased threefold over the previous fortnight, and hasBritain, isj% m%) reached a record level. The current average of 15^% may be compared withN^i&apos;trais^ii% (5%)  the highest previous level of 9% in the second half of March.   The theme isof much greater importance in propaganda to France and to Great Britainthan in propaganda for home consumption.French Weakness, like British Weakness and German Strength, wasdominated by military weakness, which occupied 84% of the total theme.The piercing of the Maginot Line had destroyed the whole French conception of strategy and had imposed a war of movement to which the French could
never adjust themselves. The substitution of General Weygand for general gamelin would not enable France to substitute an offensive for a defensivestrategy.Both military and civilian morale had broken down and a &quot; machine-oun discipline &apos;&apos; had become necessary. The French press and official reports had concealed the full extent of the disasters which were overtaking France.&quot; It was a terrible error of the warmongers in Paris to have believed thata decaying France could oppose the young Germany in full possession ofher strength.&quot;The internal political weakness of France occupied 8% of the totaltheme. Mandel&apos;s reign of terror was unable to check the spread of defeatism.M. Reynaud had called in the glorious shadow of Petain to secure his own position and to maintain his &quot; Government of national discord.&quot;The only other subject of importance was France&apos;s economic weakness.France had lost her northern industrial provinces and had been deprived ofthe coal, iron and steel which she required from Belgium and Luxembourg.The remaining factories in the south were already faced with the possibilityof stoppage owing to lack of fuel and raw material.6. British Brutality and Unscrupulousness.This theme has declined to approximately half of its previous value and Germany, ioj%^has leached a record low level.   This is due entirely to a decrease in the Britain. s% (i7i%)accusation that Britain is exploiting other countries.   At the same time France,&apos;8*&apos;% (i4&apos;%)there has been a great increase in atrocity stories, which now occupy over Neutrals, 9% (iSi%)half the total theme.    This development was considerably accentuatedtowards the end of the month.At the beginning of the fortnight the main emphasis was laid upon the bombing of non-military objectives. &quot; The random dropping of bombs by-British planes during their nightly nights over German territory continuesin spite of our repeated warnings. Their shanielessness is only surpassedby their incompetence. An exact list is being kept of all civilians killed and damage done. Let England beware .... we forget nothing. When thehour of reckoning comes, every bomb will be repaid many times. Reprisalswill be sure and resolute.&quot;Consistent emphasis was laid upon the plunder and destruction carriedout by British troops in Belgium. The British had burned Louvain, andhad looted shops and private houses. One reason for King Leopold&apos;scapitulation was the desire to save his country from the ravages of british soldiers. This conduct was compared with the care and consideration shown by Germany. British accusations of German brutality to refugees werequickly followed by a steady stream of evidence that the British themselvessystematically bombed and machine-gunned refugees.Towards the end of the month a wave of atrocity stories dealing with theBritish treatment of prisoners made its appearance in every organ of german propaganda. &apos;&apos; Reports about the torture of German soldiers by the Englishwill be remembered by the German home country. Germany will not accept such base behaviour unpunished.&quot;English hypocrisy was also attacked. The pick of the British plutocracyhad assembled at Westminster Abbey to implore the God of the Empire notto forsake his Chosen People. It was blasphemy for Puff-Cooper to speak of civilisation and love of peace. The speech of The King on the 24th Maywras attacked with unprecedented virulence. While Dr. Dietrich&apos;s reply toThe King attacked His Majesty personally,&apos;the subsequent tendency was tosuggest that the ruling clique was exploiting the Royal House for its ownwarmongering ends.Exploitation of other countries occupied two-fifths instead of the usualtwo-thirds of the total theme. The main line was that Britain was usingBelgium as she had used Poland, Norway and Holland, and had betrayedBelgium as she had betrayed Czecho-Slovakia, Abyssinia and every other country which had relied upon her. King Leopold&apos;s capitulation, deprivingEngland of her chosen cannon fodder and of her plan to fight to the lastBelgian, had been greeted with howls of fury. &quot; The honourable Belgiancapitulation should be contrasted with the shameful treachery of the english and the French at Steinkjer and Andalsnes.&quot;   England had retreated from

With all themeans at the disposal of the German armed forces, National SocialistGermany will destroy in the germ these bestial cruelties against german prisoners. There was never a moie vile and criminal France than the france of our time, a nation whose mind and actions are dominated by the basestinstincts. We fight not only against a different conception of life, but againstthe embodiment of moral inferiority, a nation fatally diseased by moralcorruption and racial decadence. There cannot be peace in Europe until thepeople of the plutocratic Reynaud,. ridden as they are by niggers and Jews,have been shown by the sharp German sword that no crime remains withoutpunishment.&quot; Both white and black French troops were said to havebehaved in a bestial manner towards German prisoners of war. Senegalesesoldiers had burnt tank gunners alive, on the orders of the highest militaryauthorities. Dum-dum bullets had been discovered in captured forts, and insuch quantities as to leave no doubt that they had been mass-manufactured.The French Government was officially informed that severe reprisalswould be taken for every case of a German flier being murdered or beingfired upon when taking to his parachute in difficulties. Field-MarshalGoring had ordered that captured French airmen should be treated asGermans were treated in France, and would be handcuffed and subjected tothe severest regime. Five would be shot for every murdered German airman,and fifty every time a German parachutist was fired upon.Whereas Germany has hitherto been careful to distinguish between the peoples and the rulers among her enemies, these accusations of atrocitieshave been expressly directed not only against the rulers, but against thewhole population of France,Charges of exploitation of other nations occupied about one-third of thetotal theme. They ran exactly parallel to those made against Great Britain.Special attention was paid to M. Reynaud&apos;s &quot; vile and contemptible &quot; attack upon King Leopold.8. Britain Lies.Germany, 2* % (3%) This theme has sunk below the already exceptionally low level of the france&apos;*% (ij%)      P^vioUS fortnight.Neutrals, 21% (3i%) La propaganda for the home population attention was concentratedmainly upon British &quot;atrocity lies.&quot; These lies * were destroyed by comparing them with similar lies, mass-produced during the last war and long since discredited. The current lie that a wounded German, aftercalling for a doctor, had shot him in the stomach, was identified in column five of the issue of The Times of the 28th August, 1914. Suchstories were in no way concealed from the home population, but werereproduced with almost loving care. The machine-gunning of refugees byGermans was expanded, with the addition that German airmen seemed to be especially fond of firing on communicants.In propaganda to Britain, and to a smaller extent to neutrals, lessattention was paid to atrocity lies than to the unmasking of British reportsof military operations.   Scorn was poured upon the suggestion that German
12. German War A ims.During the current fortnight Germany has confined her war aims to theusual generalities and has still avoided any precise definition.   She onlydesired a new Europe freed from tyranny and injustice.13. Britain Exploits France.This theme has reached its highest level since the beginning of the year,and has been of considerable importance in propaganda to France. Towardsthe end of the fortnight, however, it fell away very rapidly, and began tobe treated more as a sign of Allied disunity than of exploitation.The changes in the French Cabinet were said to be the result ofM. Reynaud&apos;s servility to England. General Weygand was England&apos;s man,and would protect Britain at the expense of his Fatherland. The french army was slaughtered in order to cover the retreat of the british expeditionary Force.Air. Churchill was sponsoring the Jew Mandel, who would see to it thatno Frenchman kicked against the pricks.The English were said to show contempt for the failures of the french army, and the French despised the British for not daring to risk their fleet.After the separation of their armies, there remained the possibility that france might seek a separate peace, leaving Great Britain to fight alone.14.

England! But was has again and again offered peace to theworld? Germany! .... German arms will give you, George of England,the answer you deserve.&quot;11. Allied War Aims.The theme of the destruction of the Reich, though practically insig- Germany, - (*%)significant, was given an interesting turn.   The French character was said to ^j^1&apos; 22have demonstrated itself as a poisoned well.   Germany was facing a spirit NeutralsJ^% (*%)of destruction and oppression which for centuries had not permittedGermany to live in peace.This theme, though unimportant during the current fortnight in day-to-day propaganda, has maintained its significance in the long-term internalpropaganda of the Reich. The Minister of Education, for example, hasrequired popular libraries, when ordering new books, to pay special attentionto those describing the conduct of the war and the intentions of Germany&apos;senemies.

Germany is in the vanguard of the battle for a new order. The fact that the nature of this revolution is left extremely vaguedoes not detract from the significance of the change.16.

Life in these countries had quickly returned to normal;(d) The slightest evidence of any desire of the United States to main-tain neutrality was stressed;(e) Peace in the Balkans had been assured.Table of the Comparative Importance of German Propaganda Lines Wireless,Press and Cable directed to various Countries, in percentages.
