(r)(40) 142).

INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.1,     There is -widespread evidence of the desire of the workpeople concerned to respond to the Government&apos;s call for accelerated production and toco-operate to the full in the working of the new system, notwithstanding the degree of regulation involved.     Reports from all parts of the country confirm that the rank and file approve of the decision to co-operate with the Governmentwhich was reached at the meeting of the National Joint Advisory Council on22nd May.     At this meeting, which was in effect a joint meeting of theBritish Employers1 Confederation and the Trades Union Congress General Council, Ioutlined the steps proposed for securing the full and proper utilisation of the country&apos;s labour supply in the war effort and received from both the confederation and the General Council an assurance of whole-hearted co-operation.To give effect to these assurances the Council decided to appoint a consultative Committee to advise me.     The Committee consists of fourteenmembers, representing in equal numbers the Confederation and the general council, and has for the time being taken the place of the National joint advisory Council.     Meetings were held on 28th May, when preliminary consideration was given to the problems of wages regulation during the warand on   4th June when the Committee made recommendations concerning compulsory arbitration and the avoidance of strikes and lock-outs.     Meanwhile, it hasbeen indicated that it is the Government&apos;s wish that, for the present,Employers and Unions should continue to operate their ordinary negotiating machinery in the normal way, regarding themselves as trustees of the national interest.     Similarly, it has &quot;been indicated that in the future the government intend to use the existing machinery of negotiation in the various industrieswith the least possible adaptation.2,     The measures necessary to secure the intensification of production have produced problems relating to such questions as the proper payment forweek-end working and in respect of periods which would otherwise have beenholiday periods.     Payment has almost invariably been made in accordancewith the normal provisions of trade agreements.3.     The dispute affecting maintenance craftsmen in the iron and steelindustry on the North-East Coast, to which reference was made last month,was settled and the embargo on   overtime   lifted as a result of proposals submitted to the two sides by the Court of Inquiry which had been appointed,4.     Further agreements have been made for the temporary relaxation ofexisting customs in regard to the employment of skilled men in the engineering and shipbuilding industries.   The Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation concludedan agreement on this subject with the Amalgamated Engineering Union on21st May and with the Electrical Trades Union on 3rd June.     Discussions between&quot;the Engineering Employers1 Federation and the Amalgamated Engineering Union and between the Federation and the Transport and General Workers1 Union and theNational Union of General and Municipal Y/orkers resulted, on 22nd May, inagreements being reached for the temporary relaxation of existing customsso as to permit for the period of the war the extended employment of women inthe engineering industry.The Engineering Employers&apos; Federation also concluded an agreement withthe Amalgamated Engineering Union on 4th June which provided that theminimum earnings of skilled operators in the toolroom should be comparable tothose of skilled production workers.5.     Considerable difficulties have arisen on large Government jobs of a building and civil engineering character owing to differences in theprovisions of the respective agreements governing wages, and working conditionsin the two industries.     On the initiative of the Department, discussions havetaken place between the organisations party to the agreements in the twoindustries with the result that agreement has been reached to set up a joint board to secure uniformity in the wages and working conditions, where necessary,of all craftsmen and labourers employed on the Government&apos;s War Programme ofbuilding and civil engineering works.     Existing agreements in the twoindustries are to continue to apply, subject to the over-riding terms of thenew agreement and decisions reached by the Joint Board thereunder.

6.     Discussions that have been proceeding for some time between theBritish Employers&apos; Confederation and the General Council of the TradesUnion Congress with a view to arriving at an agreed basis for a revisionof the Fair Wages Clause have now been concluded and agreement has beenreached on the main points of a revised Clause.7.     Apart from the matters referred to above, there has been less activitythan in previous months in the field of wage negotiations, although wagequestions have been discussed in railways, engineering, docks and printing and kindred industries.WAGES AND COST OF LIVING.8.     It is estimated that the average level of rates of wages at the endof April, 1940, was rather more than 9 per cent, higher than at the endof August, 1939.9.     The official cost-of-living index figure at 1st May, 1940, was80 per cent, above the level of July, 1914, as compared with 78 per cent.at 1st April and 55 per cent, at 1st September, 1939.     The rise of25 points since 1st September, 1939, is equivalent to about 16 per cent.The index figure for food prices at 1st May was 59 per cent, abovethe level of July, 1914, as compared with 58 per cent, at 1st April, therise during the month being due mainly to increases in the prices of eggs.Among items other than food, the prices of tobacco and matches were raised as a result of the additional duties provided for in the Budget;   theprices of clothing showed a slight rise during April, and railway fareswere increased from 1st May.10.   The following Table shows the percentage rise in the index figuresfor (a) food and (b) cost of living generally, since the beginning ofSeptember, 1939.     Particulars are also given showing the percentage risein the index figures at the corresponding periods during the war of1914-1919:-Date. 11940:-j1st January i1st February \1st March 11st April j1st May	Average Increase since 1st Sept.1939.

The monthly count, taken on 20th May, showed a further reduction of91,873 in the number of unemployed persons, the total on that date being880,822.     The subsequent weekly figures show that the reduction is continuing.     The total on 20th May included 742,204 claimants to benefit or applicants for unemployment assistance, the balance of 138,000 beingnon claimants, a considerable proportion of whom may be regarded as not normally in the industrial field and therefore as a potential addition tothe labour reserve.

12.   A special analysis which was made showed that of the 742,204 claimantsand applicants over&apos; 46 per cent had been unemployed for less than six weeks,104,909 men had been unemployed for twelve months or more, 32,000 fewer than at 1st January.     It is probably true to say, however, that not onlythis group but a considerable proportion of the group who have beenunemployed for more than six weeks will be extremely difficult to place in suitable employment.     A local review of the registers is proposed inorder to obtain an authoritative opinion of the steps necessary to getsuch men back into employment.13.   It is not yet possible to say whether the refugees frcm Holland andBelgium include any great number of workers.     Out of 14,000 of suchrefugees only some 250 have so far registered for employment.     On the otherhand, over 1,300 Norwegians who arrived in this country in whaling ships have registered for employment.     They include seamen, agricultural workers and various types of engineers.     Arrangements are being made to place them in employment as rapidly as possible.The following notes show the position in certain industries:-Building.14.   There is a growing shortage of skilled bricklayers in the areas whereGovernment work is most concentrated and difficulty has been experienced in obtaining men of good industrial quality to satisfy the competing demandsof the Government building programme,     A.R.P. construction and essentialnon-Government works.15.   To meet the new situation arising from the intensification of the War,the Works and Building Priority Committee has decided that preferences for labour and materials should be accarded, subject to the over-riding demandsof defence works, to certain vital works and buildings nearing completionand arrangements are being made to divert labour and, if necessary, men now employed on non-essential private work and less urgent Government work tothese works so as to secure the necessary acceleration.     In cases whereadditional labour has been required for urgent defence work, no difficulty has been experienced in obtaining employers1 co-operation for the releaseof suitable men in their employment.Engineering, Metals and Explosives.16.   Reference has already been made (in paragraph 4) to the furtheragreements which have recently been signed for the relaxation of customs.The demand for intensified production is being responded to at present bythe working of a large amount of overtime and the institution of manyextra night shift workings, besides measures such as training and theincreased engagement of women.     In the aircraft industry motor fitters,garage hands, etc. were engaged as a result of Lord Beaverbrook&apos;s appealto such workers to come forward for aircraft work.     Shortage of labour in shipbuilding and repairing was partly met by the working of overtime and night shifts and the reabsorption into the industry of elderly men and menunemployed for a long period.17.   The metal industries continued to work to full capacity;   with a few exceptions it was possible to satisfy the labour requirements.     A largenumber of additional workers (mainly women) were engaged on the productionof chemicals and explosives.Textiles.18.   The cotton industry continues, to be exceptionally busy, despite short time working in certain areas owing to shortages of raw materials and theshortage of skilled operatives and juveniles persists in many areas.     Thereis, however, a surplus of labour in the bleaching, printing and dyeingbranches of the industry in Lancashire.     There was short time working inthe woollen and worsted industry in the early part of the month owing to alack of wool supplies but the shortage of skilled workers persists andinexperienced workpeople continue to be imported from the colliery districts of Yorkshire and Durham.     Every effort is being made to direct redundantworkers to the industry.     In both industries there was a fairly wideobservance of the Witsuntide holiday.

19,   Employment in the clocks fluctuated widely during May, heavy increases in unemployment in the earlier part of the month &quot;being followed by asubstantial improvement.20.   As the result of the decision to issue the &quot;Painstaker&quot; telegram  bythe Ministry of Transport there was some precautionary diversion ofshipping 7/hich led to demands for additional labour at Manchester andBristol.     About 500 men were required at the former port for generalcargo and a number of men were obtained from Preston and Hull,Difficulties were, however, experienced in obtaining the full quotarequired from Hull, which finally was able to supply only 150 men.     Theremainder was sent later from London,     Bristol wanted about 100 men forgrain and timber and these were also sent from London.     The transferarrangements are being overhauled in the light of the experience gainedand changes in the organisation are to be made with the least possible delay in order to improve and speed up the machine.Agriculture.21.   Fairly heavy demands for seasonal work and particularly for thehoeing and singling of sugar beet have contributed to a further substantial reduction in the Live Register.     From most Divisions it is reported thatexperienced workers are becoming very scarce.     Dutch, Belgian and norwegian refugees who have recently arrived in this country may help tosome extent to meet the deficiencies but in general farmers will haveto re]y on various sources of inexperienced labour, e.g., untrainedunemployed, conscientious objectors, the Women&apos;s Land Army (for whichdemand in more than one area exceeds supply) and also the variousarrangements which the Agricultural Departments are putting into force,such as the organisation of mobile gangs, holiday camps for school boys,etc.22.   The various Departments concerned are taking measures to secure therelease for agriculture of road men employed by Local Authorities and thepreservation of their superannuation rights.     From Cheltenham it isreported that the County Council are arranging for casual workers in theiremploy who have previous agricultural experience to be loaned to farmersat three days&apos; notice.Forestry.23,   There are reports from nearly all Divisions of orders in circulationfor skilled workers, particularly as timber fellers, but with little prospect of their being filled.     The work is dangerous for inexperiencedmen, dilution cannot be applied quickly.     The only reserve of skilled labour consists of a certain number of wood sawyers hitherto employedin mills in various ports, where the normal supplies of imported timberhave virtually disappeared.     It is hoped that arrangements which havebeen made for payment of lodging and travelling allowances will marie it easier to transfer workers to the timber areas.The Forestry Commission estimate that they will require to import anadditional 10,000 skilled men from abroad.     Some of them may be foundamong the Dutch, Belgian and Norwegian refugees, but the majority willprobably have to come from the Dominions.   In this country the Commissionstate that they will shortly require 5,000 unskilled workers and proposals as to the necessary steps to obtain them are being considered with the timber Control Department.Paper Manufacture and Printing.24.   This is an example of an industry which has been seriously affectedby the course of the War in recent weeks.   Imports of pulp fromScandinavia have ceased, a number of firms have closed down and others are working short time.   Of 5,000 workers affected by stoppages atSittingbourne and Gravesend, many of the wholly unemployed are beingtaken on by the Dockyards at Chatham and Sheerness, and about 50 per cent of the G-ravesend men are considered to be suitable for courses inGovernment Training Centres.

training.25,     The developments in recruitment policy foreshadowed in the last reporthave now been carried into effect.     On 28th May, it was announced thatentry to Training Centres was no longer to be confined to the unemployed;and all men engaged on work not essential to the war effort-were urged to volunteer for a course of training in order to fit themselves for transfer to war industries.     At the same time, the basis of payments to traineeswas altered and increased allowances at fixed rates without test of needswere introduced.     It is too early yet to assess the full results of this appeal but figures at present available show that already during theweek ended 1st June, 1,430 applications for training were accepted asagainst a weekly average of 583 for the previous four weeks.     On 30th May,there were in training 8,105 civilians and 1,727 soldiers.26.     During the month the number of places available for the training of civilians in Government Training Centres rose to 9,267 as compared with 8,506in the previous month.     This increase is greater than appears as the latter figure included some 700 building trades places now closed.     The increase was due in part to the increased number of places made available by the gradual maturing of the expansion programmes, and also by the institution of double shift working in the machine operator and instrument making classes,and finally by double banking in the machine operator classes.     these various expedients should raise the number of available places in existing government Training Centres in due course to about 16,000 but, as mentionedin previous reports, it will &quot;be impossible to attain that figure unless many more instructors are obtained.     I am taking steps to this end.27.     The experiment of double shifting the machine operator and instrumentmaking classes begun during the course of the month, showed satisfactory results and plans are being urgently pressed forward for the extension of double shift working to all engineering classes in the Centres and also theinstitution of a third shift in the machine operator and instrument makingclasses.     It is proposed to go further and put all Centres on three shiftsfor all classes provided the necessary number of instructors are available.28.     During the month, premises for five additional Government TrainingCentres were acquired at Pontefract (336) Manchester (652) Coventry (780)Great Harwood (Nr. Accrington) (392) Preston (812) the figures in bracketsshow the number of training places proposed.     The search for further premisesis being pursued.Arrangements for adapting these premises for the Department^ use arebeing pursued energetically with H.M. Office of Works.     Grave difficulty is, however, anticipated in Obtaining the necessary equipment, in particularmachine tools, in order to establish these additional Centres.     A fairnumber of secondhand machine tools are being picked up by the Department^officers but unless some measure of priority is granted it will not bepossible to implement the figures given above.RECRUITING.29.     It has been decided to accelerate considerably the registration and medical examination of men under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act.A registration was held on 25th May, when men not already registered bornbetween 1st January, 1912, and 25th May, 1920 were registered, and two further age groups, the 1910 and 1911 classes, will be registered on successiveSaturdays in June.     The figures for 25th May show that a total of 326,259 menregistered, the largest number so far registered in one day.    -There was once again a decrease in the proportion of men registering as conscientious objectors,the total of 3,439 representing only 1.05 per cent, of the total number of menregis ter ed.The medical examination of the men is being accelerated by increasingto three, and in some cases to four, the number of daily sessions held at^the Medical Board centres.    A number of extra Medical Boards are also being appointed, and where necessary the Boards will work seven days a week.

30.     At 31st May, the number of men posted to the Forces since the introduc-tion of compulsory recruitment was 487,441, made up of 27,091 for theRoyal Navy, 438,838 for the Army, and 21,512 for the Royal Air Force.31.     The most recent figures show that 15,074 decisions have been given bythe local tribunals which have been set up to decide the applications of mento be registered as conscientious objectors.     Of these 1,686 or 11 per centhave been granted unconditional registration as conscientious objectors.SCHEDULE OF RESERVED OCCUPATIONS.32.     A considerable number of changes have recently been made in theSchedule, the most important of which are as follows.A greater measure of reservation has been afforded to several classesof underground and surface workers in coal mines, and to meet the necessityfor immediate increase in coal production, arrangements have been made wherebyno further colliery employees will be called up before 1st August, 1940.It has been decided to lower the age of reservation for essential occupationsin rope, twine and net manufacture;   artificial manures and fertilizers andtextile machinery fittings and accessories manufacture;   and also in certain important agricultural and horticultural occupations.33.     As from 1st August the age of reservation will be raised to 30 forcarpenters and cabinet makers, officers of local authorities, war-timetemporary Civil Servants, teachers, railway clerks, the administrative and executive staffs of the B.B.C. the staffs of various quasi-Government bodies and also for a number of occupations in the metal polishing and enamellingtrades and in the manufacture of stoves, grates, gas fittings^ radiators etc.and glass.34.     Full-time members of the Observer Corps under the Air Ministry are tobe reserved immediately at and above the age of 30.     Part-time members overthe age of 30 and not reserved by virtue of their ordinary civilian occupa-tion are not to be called up under the National Service (Armed Forces) Actbefore 1st January, 1941.     The Observer Corps are making every effort toreplace part-time men under the age of 35 by men over military age.35.     Full-time members of the Auxiliary Fire Servioe are already reserved at and above the age of 30.     The Service still contains, however, a number ofmen between the ages of 25 and 30, and considerable difficulty is being experienced in recruiting older men to take their place.   It was agreed, sometime ago, that men in the age groups from 25 - 27 should not be called up under the Armed Forces Act for the time being, and this concession has recentlybeen extended to men in the age groups 28 and 29.36.     Carpenters and cabinet-makers of the classes hitherto reserved at 25have been called up only for service in their corresponding Service Trades.On and after 1st August men in these occupations will be available for general service in the Forces if they are not required in their Service Trades, butmen between 25 and 30 (the new age of reservation) will be called up only if required as Service Tradesmen.     Men under 25 will be given the opportunitybetween now and 1st August of continuing to be reserved from military service by obtaining employment. in the aircraft industry, or in other armamentindustries for which they may be suitable, or by entering a course of training to fit them for such employment.     Skilled woodworkers should readily learncorresponding operations in the metal trades, and should form valuablereinforcements to the aircraft and other engineering and metal workingindustries.     Men who by 1st August have not obtained employment, or enteredfor training of the kinds in question, will be called up for service in theForces.37.     Woodworking machinists are at present reserved at 25, but men below that age are called up only if required in the Forces as tradesmen.     After1st August this will still be the position of men of 23 and 24 years of age,but men aged 20-22 inclusive will be called up for general service if notrequired as Service Tradesmen.     These men will, however, have the sameopportunity of entering the aircraft or other armament industries as is described in the preceding paragraph.6.(Intd.)   E.B
