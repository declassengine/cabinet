Ij\7.P.(R) (40) 168.-r, WAR CABINET.lJih June, 1940.OIL POSITION.Fortieth Weekly Report covering the period up to midnight on the9th June, 1940.  submitted by the Secretary for Petroleum.(Previous Report: Paper W.P.(R)(40) 163.)IMPORTS.The total imports were 367,000 tons, an increase of46,000 tons on the previous week.    This is the largest amount so farrecorded during the war.    The forward programme for the next four weeksis estimated to provide an average of over 356,000 tons per week,excluding Admiralty imports.CONSUMPTION.Consumption by the Service Departments, home and overseas,showed a small aggregate increase of 4,600 tons compared with theprevious week.    Admiralty figures were up b3r 5,000 tons and those ofthe War Office and the Air Ministry were practically the same asthose shown in the previous week.Civil consumption was 1^400 tons lower than that of theprevious week.STOCKS.(a) Services.Admiralty stocks, including home and overseas, showed a.decreaseof 22,000 tons compared with the previous week.   The Air ministry and Y/ar Office Stocks in the United Kingdom showed in each case animprovement of 7,000 tons.(b) Civil.Civil stocks showed a further satisfactory improvement on theprevious week of 100,000 tons.
GENERAL.Arrangements have lately been put in hand for giving additionalprotection to certain of the petrol tanks in this country. A scheme -for surrounding about half a million&apos;tons of storage in differentplaces with circn.lar concrete or brick walls was approved by the oil Control Board.    The work vail be carried out by the PetroleumBoard as rapidly as possible.    Major-General Sir Audrey/ J.McCulloch,K.B.E., C.B., d.3.0.,&quot;has been appointed to carry out an inspection of the protective arrangements at the larger oil installations.Acting in close concert with the Cin C., Home Forces, the petroleum Board, under the instructions of the Petroleum Department,has begun the process of thinning out &quot;the supply points in thedemarcated area in the Eastern and Southern parts of the country.In other parts arrangements are in hand for filling at garages anumber of tanks hitherto kept empty,.with a view to obtaining a wider dispersal of stocks.The Petroleum Board are engaged in working out a trade schemenot involving any Government subvention, which would provide a means of affording to garage dealers put out of business some shareof the excess commissions which would accrae to those garages retaineras supply jpoints where business will be largely increased.Agreement has recently been reached with the Association ofTar Distillers as to the terms on which largo quantities of creosoteor creosote/pitch mixture could be made available to the PetroleumBoard for use as an alternative to fuel oil, and it is hoped thatit will be found possible to absorb about 200,000 to 250,000 tonsof these tar products a year, which will have the effect of strengthening the fuel oil position against emergencies.    In viewof the improvement in the fuel oil position, it is proposed toadopt a more liberal attitude in the grant of licences for theexport of creosote to the U.S.A. where the trade will bring in some additional and useful dollar resources.G.
