Of equal importance is thearrangement for a representative of the- Ministry to be attached to each service Department, and at the same tine the representation of theService Departments in thu Ministry is being strengthened. , A much betternews relationship between the Ministry and the&apos; Service Departments is tobe expected.1.   THE REGIONS.On April l8th5 the National Council of Labour endorsed thedecision of the Parliamentary Labour.

HOjvIE AND B.E.F, BROADCASTING,An interesting new feature was the use of two well-knowncomedians (&quot;Gert and Daisy&quot;) in short daily broadcasts for a fortnight topopularise advice from the Ministry of Food0Three programmes deeding with broadcast propaganda were givenCopy No.55

COMMuTJICATIONS.A site is being sought for a high power transmitter for.... daylight broadcasting to the Continent, as approved by the War Cabineton April 4th; the manufacture and erection of the apparatus are in handA scheme for re-grouping the B.B.C. nedium-v/ave transmittersso as to obtain better coverage at home was approved on April 16 th.The scheme - involves the requisitioning of a transmitter constructed for, Lithuania, and will be completed by next November.4, FILMS.A three reel documentary &quot;Men of Africa&quot; has been taken over from the Colonial Empire Marketing Board and began a run at the LeicesteSquare Theatre on April 19th.Arrangements have been made through the Admiralty for newsreel&quot;cameramen to be attached to several units of the Fleet..5. PRODUCTION.I The Anti-Gossip Campaign and campaigns for the Ministries ofHealth (Evacuation) and Agriculture (&quot;Plough Now&quot;) have been continued.Campaigns for the Ministries of Labour (Government Training Centres),Supply (Recruitment of Munition Workers) and Mines (Fuel Economy) are inhand.   ,895,000 &quot;Re-assurance&quot; Posters were, at&apos; the request of theMinistry of Home Security, distributed to Local Authorities in vulnerablfareas. 6,000,000 copies of a &quot;Householders Card&quot; giving the mostimportant A.R.P. instructions in a durable form are being printed for distribution in the same areas as the posters.Eleven fresh Artists, including Duncan Grant and StanleySpencer, have signed contracts with the Artists Advisory Committee.The average weekly despatch in April was-737,500, comparedwith 224,120 in March.

6. ^FOREIGN, (other than U.S.A.).(i) General.&apos;The yisit of. M. Frqssard to London at the beginning of Aprilv/as of great value, enabling plans -to be laid for better co-operation.In addition to the long-range ains ; of..&apos; enphasising the strengthand determination of the Allies, their aims and the certainty of their.   victory, stress has been laid on the&apos; --following aspects of the Scandinavian-.-cacipaign:        -.; &apos; &quot;(l)   German action was premeditated, &quot;and was in train before Britainlaid mines.(2)-  Compliance with German wishes- is no protection -against aggression.-(3).   Germany has been weakened strategically and. economically by hercrime.(4)   The-ratio, between German losses and naval strength is much higher than that for Britain..     (5)&apos;  Security needs make it impossible .to;release much news.Points of special interest are:-(.1)   A 24-!-hour service has been set up to prevent loss of tine in. countering German&apos;lies, and&apos;to allow telegrams summarising theBritish press to. be sent out by Reuters in the early hours ofthe morning.        &apos;.(2)   An attempt was made to buy space in certain neutral papers toadvertise neutral losses of ships not in convoy. No paper in. jlta-iy or Denmark,&apos; Belgium, or. Scandinavia, would take the. advertisements.and. the press Bureau of the Dutch Government: -.warned: &apos;thevDutch-Press against acceptance thereby incurringcriticism, and a considerable controversy arose, not without..   -value to us. A.modified form of the advertisement appeared inone Swedish paper.(ii) Broadcasting OverseasThe B.B.C. novv broadcasts 43 foreign news bulletins in 22languages.The staff necessary for a Norwegian bulletin arrived atBroadcasting House as the Geraans were arriving at Oslo? a daily bulletinwas at once instituted and raised quickly to three. As .the main Norwegianstations are in German hands, these bulletins are the chief method ofcommunication between the Government and people of Norway; a senior-&apos; Norwegian broadcasting officer is now in London to share in the work.Bulletins are also broadcast in Swedish -and Finnish and a five-minutesnews summary is given in Danish.   A daily bulletin in Dutch was started at short notice on April 12th.   Thanks to the co-operation of the FrenchGovernment, the B.B.C&apos;s late evening bulletin in Italian, which was onlyfaintly heard in Italy, is now relayed from Antibes, which has alsobroadcast several talks - from the&apos;British angle.(ill) Films Overseas..The standard new-reele and, where necessary, special reelswith commentaries in the language of the country, are now distributed
regularly in:-Roumania, Yugo-Slavia (dubbed in three languages), Bulgaria, Iran,Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Spain, Portugal, Turkey and China.(iv) Notes on particular countries.Publicity in Denmark has been undertaken by $he Foreign Office,v/ith the co-operation of the Ministry.   The Press Attache in Norway, with whom the Ministry is still in touch, has actively helped in the re-establishnent of the Norsk Telegram Byra at Aalesund.Copies of &quot;Picture Post&quot; are being sent to 5000 hotels in holland, and newsagents in the smaller towns are offered British papers atspecial rates. A meeting arranged between Dutch correspondents in Londonand the survivors of the &quot;Protinus&quot; gave great publicity to the Germanmethods of warfare, and helped to induce in the Press a pro-british attitude to the Norwegian campaign.British newspapers now reach Amsterdam on the day of issue.. . The Italian Ministry of Popular Culture has shewn itself lesswilling to receive British articles, and the public exhibition of Britishnews-reels is confined to subjects like dog-shows.   The amount of literatursent out by the Ministry has increased.Hunrary^ under German pressure, has barred Allied news in itsPress.   The Press Attache will, if possible, maintain contact by telephonewith the B.B.C., so as to enable him to counter lies emanating fromGermany or Italy.   Progress has been made in the local broadcasting of programmes recorded in England.At the request of the Rumanian Minister-the &quot;Tines&quot;, &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, :(News Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Doily Herald&quot; have been asked to assistthe supply of foreign news to papers in Rumania;   a contract between the&quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Timpu&quot; has been initialled, and two Rumanian correspondentsare expected in London soon.    The commercial distribution of the- Films&quot;Pygmalion&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; Planes&quot; has been arranged in Rumania.In Bulgaria   British photographs are freely used in tho Press.(v) EffectReports show that, wherever Allied propaganda has entry, it isimproving in quantity, quality and effect. But entry has been madedifficult in&quot;, a number of countries where the governments fear .or favour,Gernany.   Indirect ways of approach are being developed, and the .reception given to propaganda thus conveyed shows that the common people are clearly with us.     The paramount need is for news of British -military activity distributed quickly enough to prevail over Germanallegations, and sufficiently encouraging to induce the authoritiesto resist German pressure more boldly.AMERICAand      ^Zht Uni^ed States&apos; *W neutrals, has no fear of Germanyand is therefore less concerned about British strength.   Its security^the reality of British democracy.   The Ministry counters this by arranging
for unofficial British contributions to Anerican papers and periodicals,(e.g. an interview with Mr. Herbert Morrison saying that only 1 per cent of British Labour opinion was anti-war, and an article in the &quot;AtlanticMonthly&quot; by S.E.     Ratcliffe countering an anti-British article byNehru), by supplying the British.Library of Information in New York -withmaterial on every aspect of the war, and by introducing an appropriateelement into the British Pavilion at- the Worlds Pair,,The most important of all approaches is, however, that throughAmerican newspaper correspondents and broadcasters in this country.   Muchwork has been done in securing facilities for these people, but difficulties are sometimes caused by the nature of the.news which. America expects.   Thereasons leading the Services to deprecate press and radio &quot;build-ups&quot; oftheir fighting personnel are not appreciated in the United States,, and theabsence of interviews v/ith topical war personalities is criticised.In spite of these difficulties, the latest  Gallup PublicOpinion polls showed 8Ayo hoping for a British victory as against 1% pro-German.   A recent count also showed that Allied (mainly British)photographs outnumber Enemy ones by 12 to 1 in the industrial Middle West,6 to 1 in the South and 5 to 1 in the North-West.   While the initial lackof British photographs from Scandinavia may have caused a temporary set-ba*ck, there is no doubt that as the Service Departments release goodaction photographs, they will be avidly received^8.     THE EMPIRE.In addition to normal material (which included five weeklybulletins and twenty different books or pamphlets) three special themeshave been emphasized:A.   The Strength of the AlliesB.     Nazi Aggression.C.     Nazi Propaganda inSouth Africa.(177,000 copies of &quot;The War at Sea&quot;an exhibition of photographssrimilar to that recently shown bythe London Passenger transport board, in English, French andAfrikaans and the special number ofthe Illustrated London News on theGraf Spee episode)e(The first L,PoT,B, Exhibition has arrived in each of the Dominions).(Cuttings, press-reviews andbroadcasts for the DominionInformation Officer.Photostat copies of drawing in&quot;Voelldscher Beobachter&quot; of bombing of the &quot;Watussi&quot;, and of postcardfound on German prisoner showingNazi aims in Africa).India and Burma have received some 30 feature articles a week,particularly ones on the Franco-British Entente, and five also been sentsome 7,000 copies of 6 different pamphlets.In the colonies, efforts are being concentrated on pictorialbooklets and leaflets and photogravure reproductions, of which eight sub-jects have been despatched, and two editions of &quot;The March of Time&quot; have gone to four special territories.     Colonial reports show that publicityis effective.
J.C.W.R.While the policy of the Division varies with the audience,four theues have been stressed:-1. Christian civilisation is in danger.2e The German Government is Anti-religious.3o The Christian Churches in Britain are unanimously behind the prosecution of the war.A. Promotion of friendship through the Churches,   .Increasing attention has been paid to anti-war opinion inreligious circles with a view to countering it.With the help of firns producing insets for parish magazinethe publication of regular articles has been arranged in papers withtotal circulation of over one and a half millions.A growing correspondence with Church leaders at hone and in neutral countries shows that the work of the Division is generallyappreciated.
