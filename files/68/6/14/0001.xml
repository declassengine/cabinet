In view of anticipated congestion at Petsamowhich suffered considerably during the Finnish-Soviet War,  ithas also been suggested that the Norwegian port of Kirkenesshould be used.Baltic status6* The shipment of flax to Istanbul via the U.S.S.R. continuesfairly/

fairly regularly,      The Baltic countries are now trying touse that route for the import of raw materials and othergoods which formerly were shipped via the Baltic.rwj^ZERhAllD7, satisfactory assurances having &quot;been, received in Berneupon the points left over from the Paris discussions whichterminated at Easter, &quot;war Trade Agreements in identic terms were signed on the 23th April by the French Government inParis and by H.M. Minister in Berne on behalf of His Majesty5 sGovernment.ITALY8, There has been some increase of tension in regard toContraband Control, and on April 26th the Italian Ambassadorcomplained to the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs that an undue number of Italian ships (14) were detained atMediterranean bases.      Investigation showed that some ofthese ships had already been released, or were about to be released, and the examination of others was expedited.9. Entirely reliable information has &quot;been received that part of a oargo of wheat released on the strength of aguarantee from a Consortium was sold at once to a firm offorwarding agents and sent by rail to Germany.      Suitablemeasures are under consideration.10,       The Chairman of the federation of Merchants of Triestehas visited London to discuss methods of facilitating thetrade of Trieste with the Balkans,      A form of agreement,to be signed by approved merchants, was discussed and agreed in principle.11.       Conversations have also taken place with the managing director of &quot;A.C.N.A.n the principal Italian producer ofdyestuff3.

I1i only remains to settle the finaltexts of the rationing agreement with the Delegation,GENERAL15*       An Interdepartmental Meeting is being held to considerthe control of civil aircraft.      This question was discussedduring the conversations with M, Monnet in London on the 6thApril,      Serious misgivings have been expressed as regardsthe increasing extent to which civil aircraft are being usedto convey mails, as well as goods of high value in proportion to their weight, through the Allied control system.      Theproblem of control, however, bristles with difficulties.II. CONTRABAND CONTROL16.       During the week ending 27th April, 83 new ships were dealt with,     in 57 cases advance copies of manifests were received and considered before the ship&apos;s arrival at contraband control Bases and in 14 such cases the ships concerned were released by the Committee subject to the formal checking of theoriginal manifests on their arrival at the Control Bases.18 ships/

18 ships were allowed to carry forward cargo under Holdback,guarantees,xy,       5*. 12u tons of goods wars seised from .3.5 ships.].g..       The number of ships at Channel bases has declined from 6u at the end of the previous week to 3m- at the end oflast week, as a result of an increase in the flow of shippingallowed to go on to the Low Countries.   - There are still J,brships at Kirkwall.      The average period of detention of the39 ships released from United Kingdom bases in the courseof the past week was 8.8 days,NiiVTGERTS19,       During the week ending 27th April, there were 2,000applications for navicerts.      Total applications to datenumber h9?6h2, of which 39,734 have been granted,      Up todate, there have been 227 fully-navicerted ships 93 of whichcarried 11 Ship Navicerts&apos;.&apos;,^C-RJiiaiAtiiHT6 WITH COMPANIES AND FIPMS20,       A general form of guarantee of ultimate destinationhas been given by the Iceland subsidiary of the Socony Vacuumoil Company..GENERAL PRIZE QUESTIONS21.       The Contraband Committee has directed release for theUnited Kingdom of all goods carried in ships now in UnitedKingdom ports or bases and which were originally destined forNorway, Sweden or the Baltic States (including Finland),,      Thegoods can be disposed of in this country by the owners or theiragents,22.       Negotiations are now in progress with the various governments concerned and machinery is being set up to dealwith all cargoes (in particular consignments, of which the&apos;property has already passed to the consignees) in a mannersatisfactory to all parties.     At the same time, procedure isbeing/

being&apos; adopted to enable the various Supply Ministries to &quot;beprovided with full information of all cargoes in the sale and purchase of which they may be interested,      Where the goodscannot readily he disposed of in the United Kingdom,  it isanticipated that efforts will he made to find suitable marketsin Allied countries or among approved buyers in neutral oountri23,       Meanwhile,  in order to avoid unnecessary loss,, allperishable cargoes are being sold immediately on arrival-inthis country, the question of ownership of the proceeds of sale being left in abeyance pending conclusion of negotiationswith the countries concerned.2h,       Two ships, now in U.S-.A. ports, were, upon the receiptof assurances from the Finnish Legation, granted ships&apos;navicerts to allow them to proceed unhindered to the port ofretsamo.      In general it has been decided to resume considcr-ation of applications for Navicerts for shipments to Finlandprovided that the goods are destined only for Finland, andthat the port of Petsamo is used for this purpose,25,       The Egyptian Government has agreed to the use of port said as a voluntary port of unloading for suspect cargo, inorder that the carrying ship may be spared the diversion toHaifa.26..       The Contraband Committee has considered the questionof Hold-back guarantees in the Mediterranean and the detention of goods, particularly at Trieste.      It was thought thatwherever it was possible to have ships manifests in advanceof their arrival at Gibraltar or Port Said, goods to be seized should not be allowed to go forward under holdbackout should be discharged in Marseilles or Oran, in the formercase, or at Haifa, Malta or Port Said,  in the latter case,27,       A new device has been introduced in the Swiss war trade Agreement for the purpose of keeping a check on goods which/

which pass our controls as destined for Switzerland and could then he diverted to an enemy destination.      Goods forSwitzerland will he passed through our control only on ourreceiving a copy of a Certificate of Guarantee issued by the swiss Government to importers along with the import licence.The Swiss Customs authorities which possess, another copy ofthe guarantee will endorse and so cancel it when the goods to which it relates are actually imported.      If any certificateis not cancelled;,  the fact will be made known to the mixed commission at Berne, and suspicion will fall on the importerwho has not utilised his licence to import.28.       The Netherlands Legation has protested against anumber of seizures which have taken place since the conclusionof the War&apos; Trade Agreement.      The Butch maintain that if wehave any evidence of an intention on the part of importersto smuggle goods to enemy territory in spite of Governmentalprohibition, we should inform them and should not seize onthe basis of the Black Lists,ENEMY EXPORTS29.       The Committee met six times this week.     It reviewedsix ships, of which h wez^e released;    one was detained forenquiries and, in the remaining case, v/hich had been referred by the Contraband Committee on account of certajn goods ofsuspect origin, the Enemy Exports Committee agreed that thegoods in question should be placed in Prize,30.       The Committee considered 87 applications for exemption,of which 62 were granted, 22 were refused and 3 were deferred for further consideration.      In addition to those consideredby the Committee, 134 applications were treated summarily, ofwhich 68 were granted and 86 refused.31.       Among the general matters considered by the Committeewas the possibility of reducing the export to neutral countries of German bunker coal.      It appeared doubtful whether suchcoal/

coal in neutral ships could legally he regarded as an enemyexport and placed in Prize under the existing Order inCouncil of 27th November, 1939.     The Committee, therefore,considered.that the possibility should be further exploredof limiting the use of such coal by neutral shipowners throughnegotiation with them.      When, however, the matter was consid-ered Departmentally it was agreed,  in view of certain diffi-culties felt by the Mines Department and Ministry of shipping,that it would be undesirable to take action in the matter atthe present time.      The question was,  therefore, postponed for consideration at a later date,32,       Enemy export control has played a large part in thediscussions between the State Department at Washington andthe special -anglo-French Mission there.      The United StatesGovernment hoped that the Alliecl Embassies would issue astatement embodying considerable concessions to United Statesimporters.     The Allied Governments, however, felt bound torefuse the principal concessions asked for, namely thatexemption would be granted (1) for goods ordered before theReprisals Order in Council and paid for by the end of 1939,whether or not such payment was re quired by the terms of theoriginal contract;    and (2) for goods  &quot;essential&apos; to UnitedStates industry.     Meanwhile, the United States Ambassador inLondon had suggested that we should make a statement showing that many of the United States firms demanding exemption wereenemy-controlled or had advanced fraudulent evidence in supportof their claims and should offer generous treatment to bonafide importers.      But this proposal, even in the modifiedform in which it was accepted by us, was emphatically rejected by the State Department,      In the end, after considerabletelegraphic correspondence, an innocuous short statement tothe press has been issued in Washington, promising a recon-sideration/

sideration of cases of hardship resulting from refusals of applications for exemption, and that applications will infuture be received in respect of categories of goods whichafford matter for special consideration and are unobtainableelsewhere than in Germany.
