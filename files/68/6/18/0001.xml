Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1940.SECRET. Copy No,     55W.P. (R.) (40) 138.May 7, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ANALYSIS OF GERMAN PROPAGANDA, APRIL 16-30, 1940.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues, for their information, an analysis of German propaganda for the period the 16th-30th April, which has beenprepared by the Department for Publicity in Enemy Countries.H.Foreign Office, May 7, 1940.This Analysis of German Propaganda covers the period from the 16thto 30th April, 1940.The arrangement follows lines similar to those of the previous Analysis.German propaganda is divided into a number of themes intended to providea basis for comparison.Firstly, a short summary is made of the major trends of propaganda during the past fortnight.A brief description is then given of each of these. In the margin beside the items are placed percentage figures showing their comparative importancein relation to the total propaganda directed to (1) the German homepopulation; (2) Great Britain; (3) France; and (4) neutral countries. In brackets after each figure is shown the corresponding percentage for theprevious fortnight.  A table is then given summarising these percentages.German propaganda during the whole fortnight was naturally stilldominated by the campaign in Norway. This again led to an increase in military Operations and German Strength at the expense of other themes.British Brutality, in particular, has suffered from this development.The essential theme underlying the greater part of German propagandahas been the invincibility of German arms and the feebleness of her enemies.Propaganda on specifically military subjects now occupies 50 per cent, ofthe total (compared with 24 per cent, and 36 per cent, during the two preceding fortnights).The order of importance of the main lines of propaganda during thepast fortnight was : (1) Military Operations.(2) German Strength.(3) British Weakness.(4) British Brutality.10813-9   [21252] b

German Strength. :   ,There has again been a marked increase in this theme, especially in propaganda to the home population, where it has reached the highest levelsince the Polish campaign. In propaganda to other countries there has beena much less marked increase, and the theme has not yet returned to the high level of six weeks ago. i i &quot;Emphasis on military strength, much the most important sub-theme,remained constant to Germany, but increased to other countries.&apos; It has beenillustrated almost exclusively by the Norwegian campaign. The german air Force has dominated the skies in Norway, and has destroyed the powerof the British Fleet. &quot; Now begins the test of aeroplanes against battleships.This test is as significant as the point at the end of the Middle Ages whenmusket balls began to penetrate armour.&quot; Great attention was paid to theco-operation between the air and land forces, and to the immense advantagethis had conferred on German arms. During the latter part of the period under review the main stress was laid on the ability of German mechanisedtroops to advance over almost insurmountable obstacles. &quot; Hitler&apos;s germany is the most powerful war instrument in the world.&quot;Two minor items will illustrate this general insistence upon Germany&apos;sinvincibility. The first number of the propaganda magazine Signal, printedin several languages, dealt almost exclusively with Germany&apos;s military and.to a lesser extent, economic strength. A new soldiers&apos; song, published bythe Party, connects the miserable failure of Beck, Mosczicki, Benes,Schuschnigg and the Emperor of Abyssinia with the feebleness and certainfate of Eden, Chamberlain and &quot; Churchill-Winston.&quot;Owing to Hitler&apos;s birthday, there was a considerable increase in thestress laid upon German internal political strength. Hitler had given unityto Germany, and Germany&apos;s strongest weapon was love, obedience and confidence in him. &quot; It is our pride that we are allowed to serve the Fiihrerin his titanic work with utter devotion.&quot; England herself now recognises that the Fuhrer and the German people are one and indivisible.The third sub-theme (occupying nearly 4 per cent, of German homepropaganda) was emphasis on the support of Italy. Collaboration was becoming closer and Italy was now in her position at Germahy&apos;s side. the friendship of the Fuhrer and the Duce was the best guarantee that theirtwo peoples would stand together in this difficult struggle to its victoriousend. Italy and Germany would then dominate Europe and would be thebearers of its future culture.Russia and Japan were barely mentioned.The support of neutral countries was less emphasised than during thepreceding fortnight, and this topic consisted mainly in references toGermany&apos;s economic and cultural relations with Yugoslavia, Hungary and bulgaria.Germany&apos;s economic strength was illustrated by reference to theadvantages gained in Scandinavia, such as better access to Swedish iron ore and to Danish shipyards.Germany, 30% (21%)Britain, 26% (15$%)France, 30% (15J%)Neutrals, 30% (24%)fKGermany, $%Britain, $%  (1%)France, - (1$%)Neutrals, 1% (1*%)2. Military Operations.There has been a further considerable increase over the high level ofthe previous fortnight. This theme is now no less important in propaganda to Britain and France than to Germany and the neutrals. Prominence wasgiven, firstly, to land operations; secondly, to the bombing of ports, transports,convoys and landing parties; thirdly, to the shooting down of british aircraft; and fourthly to the destruction of submarines.The occupation of Norway continued to be treated as a triumphantprogress carried out according to plan. While the rank and file of the enemy had fought bravely they had been unable to stem the victorious advance of theGerman army. They had been paralysed by the destruction of their com-munications by the German Air Force.3. Neutrals oppose A Hies.This, theine, apart from the hostility of Italy, was.of small importance.\
(14%)4. British Weakness.In consonance with the general increase in the attention paid to military Germany. 12*%subjects, the sub-theme of Britain&apos;s military weakness has continued to Britain. 24% (23$%)increase at the expense of other topics.   The failure of the Allied counter- France,&apos;is% (i4i%)attack in Norway has naturally been given great prominence.   Scorn was Neutrals, 15*%^poured upon &quot; the propaganda landings for prestige purposes in the ArcticCircle,&quot; and on the &quot; forthcoming victorious voyage of the British Fleet tothe North Pole.&quot;   The British Fleet had completely failed to stop Germanreinforcements and supplies.   Its strength had been crippled by the loss,according to one i&apos;eport, of ninety units.   The North-Western ExpeditionaryForce was composed of untrained men, lacking equipment,  tanks and artillery.   Her inferiority in the air was admitted by Britain herself.&quot; The British failure in Norway may teach the British people that waris the supreme test of the lifework of farseeing soldiers and sailors, and nota sportsground for a dabbler in strategy.&quot;Britain&apos;s economic weakness was given secondary emphasis. Most stresswas laid upon the effect on British economy of the loss of Scandinavianmarkets and the impossibility of finding substitutes for Swedish iron ore andScandinavian timber, on account of the shortage of shipping space. It is ofinterest that the British Budget was mentioned only once in propaganda tothe home population, when the inequality of the burden of taxation wasdenounced. To other countries attention was drawn to the crushing level oftaxation, which still would not prevent inflation, and to the foolish under-estimate of the costs of war.Social propaganda followed the usual lines of contrasting theprofiteering and easy lives of the rich with the hardships and insecurity ofthe poor.Britain&apos;s internal political weakness was given importance in propa-ganda to Britain only and was illustrated by criticisms of the Governmentsnews policy and by the growth of anti-war sentiment. It is noteworthy thatGermany herself has never ceased to differentiate between the British people and the British Government, and to endeavour to destroy faith in leadership.Dissensions within the Empire were given little attention and confinedalmost entirety to reports of troubles in India. This subject now occupiesonly about 0-7 per cent, of all German propaganda, as compared with about per cent, in November.5. French weakness.Emphasis continues to be placed primarily on military weakness, Germany, 3% (3%)illustrated by events in Norway.   The charges in general have run parallel j^fnee&apos;&apos;iq%.to those made against Great Britain, but a greater proportional stress has Neutrals, 5.v% (4i%)been laid upon the nervousness of the people and the Press.The insecurity of M. Reynaud&apos;s Ministry supplied the greater part ofthe material for attacks on French internal political weakness. In France,just as in England, there was a &quot;crisis of leadership.&quot;Economic weakness was illustrated by the coal shortage and the loss of paper imports from Scandinavia. It was pointed out that the inti&apos;oductionof rationing by France placed in their true light previous jeers at Germany&apos;sown very comprehensive and well thought-out rationing system.France&apos;s social weakness was almost entirely neglected.6. British Brutality and Unscrwpulousness.This theme has suffered severely in propaganda to all countries and now Germany, h% (19%)stands at a record low level.   The current average of 14 per cent, may be ^aiice io?%(i5i%)compared with the average of 32 per cent, reached during the last fortnight Neutrals, iel%in February (which included the Altmark incident). &quot; (2ii%)The greater part of the theme was designed to show that Britain herselfintended to invade Norway, and was at the moment exploiting Norwegians.The Fourth German White Book was declared to be a political bomb of the heaviest calibre, proving irrefutably the guilt of the Western Powers forthe extension of the war to Scandinavia. These instructive documents werenothing less than the death sentence of the war criminals, Chamberlain,Churchill, Reynaud and their comrades, before the conscience of the world.[21252] B 2
They were the main topic of world discussion, and the moral credit of theBritish Government has received a blow from which it will never recover.The whole of the neutral press emphasises that these documents place nationsunder the obligation of reconsidering their relations with Britain in the mostscrupulous manner.The activities of British Secret Service agents in Norway have also been finally unmasked. England is now inciting Norway to futile resistance, andis using Haakon as she used the Negus. When there is fighting to be done,the English troops stay behind and send the Norwegian, French and colonialtroops into the front line.Having failed in Norway. England is now turning her attention to the balkans and to the Near East.It is of interest that propaganda instructions issued by the Party atthe end of March also concentrated on BritairTs historic violation andexploitation of neutrals.The campaign to fix the guilt upon the R.A.F. for the initiation of the bombing of open towns has been intensified. &quot; The enemy has opened airwarfare against undefended places without military importance. the constant repetition of these incidents proves that they are not purelyaccidental. Germany is therefore not prepared to remain indifferent for much longer. If Britain disregards this final warning, she will soonexperience the horrors of unrestricted air war.&quot; In propaganda to GreatBritain, the argument is developed along these lines : &apos;&apos; Everybody with any sense will agree that the bombardment of civilians is something to be avoided :on perfectly general and obvious grounds, therefore, you would be well advised to make your Government understand the grave danger which attendsthe bombing of open towns in German possession.&quot;7. French Brutality.This theme has suffered a decline parallel to that of British Brutality.The charges in general were reflections of those made against Great Britain,but slightly greater stress was laid upon France&apos;s desire to embroil sweden and Belgium.More attention than hitherto has been paid to reports of atrocities inthe French Empire, such as &quot;brutal blood sentences&quot; in Damascus andCasablanca.8. Britain lies.This theme has concentrated largely on the refutation of British reportsof the progress of the Norwegian campaign. Premature stories of the capture of Bergen, Trondheim, Hamar, and above all of Narvik, were usedto show how little trust could be placed in any British report. special attention was paid to the British &quot;bluff&quot; about laying minefields in theNorth Sea and the Baltic minefields which had not, in fact, impairedGerman communications with Norway.Great indignation was also displayed at British stories of german atrocities in Norway, such as the personal hunt for King Haakon and the bombing of open towns and hospital ships.9. France lies.Germany, i% (i%) French reports of Allied successes in Norway were compared withPrniice&apos;5%^(2i%) s^m^v and equally false reports of the Polish campaign and the SpanishNeutrals, n% ai%) Civil War.   The French press was deceiving the public to such an extent that maps showing the relative position of England and Norway had beencensored.10.

The declineNeutrals, 1% (3%)   was especially noticeable in propaganda to France.   The war is, as usual,referred to as the &quot;war declared by England &quot; or &quot; England&apos;s war.&quot;Germany, 5% (7%)Britain, 41% (7*%)France, 5% (10%)Neutrals, 6% (9%)Germany, 4% (3J%)Britain, 7% (G %)France, 5% (4%)Neutrals, 5% (4J%)
11. Allied war aims.This theme has concentrated more than usual upon the Allied desire to Germany, u%destroy Germany itself and not merely the National Socialist Government, p^&apos;&quot;&quot;&apos;    jfSurprisingly little attention, however, was paid to Mr. Duff Cooper&apos;s speech Neutrals, i% $%)on St. George&apos;s Day (characterised as &quot;an outburst of animal hatred &quot;).As previously pointed out, much greater importance has been attached tothis theme in internal propaganda by means of lectures, meetings andexhibitions.12. German war aims.This theme was, as usual, played down.  References by Hess to colonies Germany, - j-yand by Ley to&apos;the &quot; glorious future open to German youth in the whole world Fraiice&apos;&apos;&apos;^ (--)after the destruction of England &quot; received only the slightest attention.

(3 - 3 per cent.).Neutrals, 0-2 per cent. (0-3 per cent.).The underlying theme continues to be that the Western plutocrats andmaterialists had declared war on Germany because they feared the achieve-ments of German Socialism. Financiers needed war to get themselves outof the mess created by the world depression.16. A nti-Semitism.This theme, a pervasive rather than an unmixed line of propaganda, has Germany, j% q%)generally declined in importance.    The favourite subject has been the Britain, - (ij%)denunciation of the activities of M. Hambro, the Speaker of the Norwegian Neutrals!Parliament, and his financier relatives.These sixteen themes constitute the main lines of German propaganda.The following individual points, however, deserve mention  (a) Considerable stress has been laid on the strength of Italy&apos;s armed forces and her favourable strategic position. Events in the north sea have shown that the command of the Mediterranean rests with the Italian Air Force, and no longer with the British Fleet.Italy is conscious of her mission and is justified in her.desire for complete control of the Mediterranean. More attention, indeed,was paid to Italian ambitions than to German war aims.
(b) The Swedish press and radio have been sharply rebuked forspreading atrocity stories. &quot; A Swedish paper can expose itselfby publishing British lie reports as much as it likes, alwaysassuming that it decently denies them afterwards^ but what is out of the question is a&quot; sly atrocity propaganda.&quot;(c) The determination of the United States to stay out of the war hasbeen repeatedly underlined.Table of the Comparative Importance of German Propaganda Lines Wireless,Press and Cable directed to various Countries, in Percentages.
