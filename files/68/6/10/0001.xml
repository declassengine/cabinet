MIFISTRY    OF    ECONOMIC    WARFARE.Weekly Report on Action TakenApril ll+th    -   April 21st 19UO. &apos; .War Trade Negotiations and Relations with Neutral States.general on the 11th April, the French Mission communicateda memorandum from the French Ministry of Blockade regardingthe rationing of neutrals.    M. Monnet&apos;s memorandum insisted on the necessity for applying the quota system to neutral countries without delay.    It proposed a list of the commoditiesfor which quotas should &quot;be fixed in the first instance;    this list included mineral oils,  oilseeds and fats,  fodder andcattle food,  copper,  nickel,  tin,   lead,  zinc &quot;bauxite, vanadium,chrome,  tungsten,  cobalt,  cadium,  molybdenum,  titanium,glucinium,  wool,  cotton,   jute,  rubber,  raw hides and skins.The memorandum also suggested the general principles on whichthe quota system should &quot;be operated.    Since one of the main principles which has &quot;been accepted by both Allied governments is that the quota system must be applied with no discrimination between small neutrals and the more powerful neutrals,  itis evident that the crux of the whole situation is the policywhich the Allied Governments are prepared to pursue towardsItaly.2, On the 18th. April,  the French Mission communicateda further memorandum from M. Monnet.    In this document M.Monnet suggested that negotiations might without delay be initiated with the Italian Government on the whole questionof naval and air control in the Mediterranean.    The objectivewould be to induce the Italians to agree that their air linesoperating services between Italy and Spain should land on french territory for control purposes.    Since the italians were unlikely to agree to this proposal,  the Frenchcommunication /

coinmunleation suggested that we might indicate to them thatif they do not agree to submit voluntarily to air control,we shall treat Italian shipping with less leniency than atpresent.3, These proposals are under consideration.    The decision taken by the Allied Governments must clearly depend on their decision on the whole question of their policy towards Italy,which may not permit a tightening up of &quot;blockade&quot; measures affecting Italy   for the present.I4.. The Anglo-Norwegian War Trade Agreement;, which wasfunctioning smoothly prior to the invasion of Norway by Germany,has now of course been superseded by events.5. Mr. Raeder, who was to have served as the Norwegianmember of the Joint Comraissionfcw resident In London, has now arrived in London via Stockholm and Perth with instructions from his Government to negotiate with the Treasury and theBank of England for the release of Norwegian balances paid intointo the Bank of England under the Payments Agreement betweenthem and the Norges Bank.6. The Ministry of Shipping have negotiated an arrangement for covering Norwegian ships against V/ar and Marine Risks tofacilitate the diversion to Allied ports of Norwegian ships at present at sea or in neutral ports.7. No part of the Norwegian Antarctic Whale Oil catchhas reached Norway,  and the whaling factories have receivedinstructions to proceed to A.llied ports.FINLAND.5. In view of the anxiety of the Finnish Government tobe in a position .to say that they have reached agreement withHis Majesty&apos;s Government in principle before meeting the germans and Russians for trade negotiations they have been informedthat /

that the principles agreed upon by them and Mr. Charles Hamore,can form the &quot;basis for a War Trade Agreement as scon as circumstances permit.9. A Finnish ship,  proceeding to Bergen under Britishescort, when ordered to return to the United Kingdom on theoutbreak of hostilities in Norway,  left the escort and sailedalone to Iceland and from there to Petsamo;    she reached this -port safely shortly after its evacuation by the Russians.The Finns propose to send other ships to Petsamo,  now inUnited Kingdom ports.BALTIC STATUS.10. Further consignments of Baltic flax have arrived atIstanbul.11. It is reported that &quot;these countries are endeavouring to import goods via the Mediterranean and Russia.THE ITETKDRIAI7D S .12. A Netherlands delegation is now in Paris discussingvarious points arising out of the draft War Trade Agreement.13. His Majesty&apos;s Minister at The Hague has approached theNetherlands Government with a suggestion that they should consist-operate in reducing oil stocks in The Netherlands.    Thisproposal was extremely badly received by The NetherlandsMinister of Foreign Affairs,,  and it seems clear that there isno hope of persuading the Netherlands Government to take actionon the lines suggested.BELGIUM.lh. The first meeting of the Mixed Commission took placein Paris between April 17th-20th.SWITZERLAND.15. There have been satisfactory discussions with the swiss authorities in Berne,  and it is hoped that the War trade agreement /

.. k -Agreement will be signed both ^oy the French and ourselves thisweek.BULGARIA .1c. A memorandum was communicated by the Foreign Office tothe Bulgarian Minister on April l6th,  containing comprehensiveproposals covering Questions of Anglo-Bulgarian trade.17. The proposals provide for increased purchases of Bulgariangoods,  in return for which, larger quantities of raw materialswill be made available to Bulgaria from the sterling area. these purchases and sales will be dependent on satisfactory paymentsarrangements, by which Bulgaria will use two-thirds of the sterling derived from her sales to the United Kingdom on purchases of United Kingdom manufactured goods.    The memorandum also contains proposals for a rationing agreement, and suggests that united Kingdom purchases in Bulgaria would be facilitated byundertakings on the part of the Bulgarian Government to limit their exports of some commodities to Germany.GREECE .18. The Greek requirements under List &quot;3&quot; of the War trade agreement,  providing for the fixing of import quotas,  have nowbeen examined and the comments of His Majesty&apos;s Government havebeen sent to His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Athens for communication to the Greek Government.19. In most cases it has been possible to accept the Greekfigures.    There are one or two important exceptions, however,e.g. cotton, rubber,  tin, where it has been necessary to suggest a reduced figure.ROuMANIA.20. Discussions with the Roumanian Delegation for a rationingagreement have made good progress.    The quotas for the first quarter have now been agreed in respect of nearly all the important commodities.    The exceptions are mostly commodities of which.Roumania /

. - 5 -Rouvnania claims to have increased requirements for rearmamentpurposes.21. It has nor/ become clear that the negotiations with theTurkish Government for a Per Trade Agreement, which have beendragging on since December, 1939,  are not likely to bear1 fruiton their present basis,22. The Turkish Government while,  for the most part,  theyhave not acted at variance with the suggestions which havebeen made to them, have made it plain that they are not likelyto agree to the proposals so far put forward by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment until they have stabilised their commercial relationswith Germany.    After consultation,  therefore, with His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Angora,  it has been decided to put a new set of proposals forward to the Turkish Government.    These proposals are that the Turkish Government should undertake:(a) To limit her exports to Germany of wool,  cotton,mohair,  tanning materials and olive oil to a figure to be agreed upon,  (it is hoped that the agreed figure for wool,  cotton and mohair willbe nil).(b) Not to increase exports to adjacent neutralsof these five commodities beyond the normal pre-war figures.(c) To prohibit the export of all goods importedby sea.In return for these undertakings, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will agree to facilitate the operation of the contraband control in so far as Turkey is concerned.23. Even if it .takes some time to agree the figures towhich the export to Germany of the five commodities mentioned,is limited,  an exchange of letters comprising an agreement onthe /

the above lines would have the useful effect of obtaining&quot;certain undertakings from Turkey which she at present has not agreed to give.Contraband Control.2h. Curing the week ending 20th April,  76 new ships were dealt with.25. In 53 cases advance copies of manifests were received and considered before the ship&apos;s arrival at Contraband control bases and in 8 such cases the ships concerned were released by the Committee subject to the formal checking of the originalmanifests on their arrival at the Control Bases.26. 11+ ships were allowed to carry forward cargo underHoldback guarantees.27. There were seizures of 15*1US tons of goods in 36ships. *28. Owing to the present policy of detaining ships bound for Scandinavian and Baltic ports and restricting shipping tothe Low Countries the number of ships in United.Kingdom control bases is increasing.    During the week ending 20th April,  51ships entered United Kingdom Bases on the inward voyage to europe,  and 16 ships were released with an average detention of 6 days.29. 95 ships are now detained at United Kingdom bases,35 of which are at - Kir lew all.* Navicerts.30.&apos; During the week ending 20th April applications forNavicerts numbered 1916-    Total applications to date number47? 61+2 of which 38,198 have been granted.    Applications forScandinavian and Baltic countries have dwindled to a trickle.Following on the agreement with the Dutch Government theDutch indicated that they considered that navicerts for goods to Holland were objectionable to them and now unnecessary to us the /

The reply has been given that the ITavicert system is in no way affected by the Agreement.Agreements With shipping Lines^31. A formal agreement on the usual lines has been madewith the Jugoslav Line Jadranska Flovidba covering two of theirvessels which ply between Trieste Susak and the Piraeus.32. There has also been a confidential exchange of lettersrelating to four of the company&apos;s steamers engaged on coastaltraffic in territorial waters.    The arrangement agreed providesfor consular supervision of loading and unloading and for the submission to us of manifests.    In addition the company under-takes not to carry types of cargo of which we disapprove orcargo consigned to or by names of which we disapprove.Enemy Exports.33* The Committee met seven times this week.    It reviewed10 shix^s,  of which 5 were released after detention for enquiries;in one case permission to ship certain goods from Rotterdamwas given subject to an undertaking by the -company concerned to pay on demand for the only two parcels which had not yetbeen paid for;    in another case, where a certificate of originhad been issued for goods consigned to the United Kingdom, butused for the same goods consigned to South America, theCommittee directed that full enquiries should be made.    The3 remaining ships, which were carrying to Finland war materialstated to be of.Belgian or Italian origin,  were released bythe Contraband Committee and the Enemy Exports Committee on anundertaking from the Finnish Government that the goods were for use in Finland only.3h* The Committee considered 52 specific applications for exemption, of which it granted hh-, refused 5 and deferred 3 forfurther consideration.    Of the hh applications granted,  h-1 wereapplications by a Dutch firm in respect of electrical machinery and / &apos;

and equipment, which, had previously been refused and werereconsidered at the instance of the Netherlands Legation.Payment had been made before January 1st 1940 and the Committee,being satisfied that no further benefit would be likely toaccrue to Germany, decided to grant exemption.35. In addition to those considered by the Committee,28U applications were treated summarily,  of which L3 were granted and 2hi refused.36. In accordance with the wishes of the India Office,the Committee agreed that export passes should, be granted inrespect of 30,000 shells from a German firm for use in mountainguns already in the possession of the Afghan Government.This consignment (which was at Trieste) was part of an ordergiven by the Afghan Government in 1936 and 1937 under a barterarrangement.    The total value of the contract was about 800,000, and though it was difficult to establish -whetherpayment had been made for individual items,  the AfghanGovernment had given an assurance that they had in Germanysufficient raw materials and credits to meet their obligations under this arrangement.General Prize Questions.37. Hitherto two or three differing forms of declarationsof ultimate destination have been in use according as theyrelated to (l) Export Licensing or (2) Contraband Control.The consent of the Board of Trade, Dominions Office, ColonialOffice and India Office has now been obtained to a form of undertaking, more exacting than any hitherto in use, whichshall be required for the purposes mentioned above.    Thenew form of undertaking covers transit through enemy territory and enemy interest,  as well as destination.38. In conformity with a decision of the War Cabinet asystem has been put into operation whereby the detention of cargoes /

cargoes for Belgium and Holland is prolonged in such a way as to ensure that each day fewer.vessels are a],lowed to proceedfrom Control Bases to these countries than are known to have left these countries on outward voyages.39i His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the countries concerned have been asked for their views as to the feasibilitynf a reduction of the permitted proportion by value of enemymaterials in goods exported from European neutral countries from 23)3 to \% or 1GJS.
