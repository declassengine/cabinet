16th Fortnightly Report submitted &quot;by the secretary covering the period loth to 30th April.for MinesCoal Position.production and Employment.The recovery in production since the Easter holidays, to whichI referred in my last report, has been maintained but has not made further progress;    during the last few weeks both the numbers employed and the time worked at the pits have remained practicallyconstant, with the result that the output tff saleable coal has shown a tendency to become stabilised for the time being at about 4.86million tons per week (equivalent to about 243 million tons per &apos;annum) 0Estimated Quantity of Saleable Coal RaisedoWeek endedI9h0cCorresponding week1959013th April20th     &quot;27th     &quot;(provisional)&apos;ons4,878,2004,852,6&apos; &quot;4,867,600,000Tons3,492,400 (Easter)4,856,7004,818,100Wage EarnersoWeek ended19400Corresponding week1939.13th April20th     &quot;27th     !!

Nevertheless,local difficulties persist in the South West in regard to housecoal,in the North West in regard to coal for public utilities and inLancashire and Yorkshire in regard to industrial coal.     Every effort is being made to overcome these difficulties with the least possible delay, but the success of these efforts must depend largely on the achievement of a further increase in output in the not too distantfuture.     By peacetime standards the   level of production already reached might be regarded   as satisfactory, but the wartimerequirements for Great Britain and France and for export call for afurther substantial increase,     While, generally speaking,  thesupply position is not unsatisfsctory in relation to current consumption, there is an insufficient margin available to provide forthe rebuilding of stock to a safe level and to satisfy the demand forexport.It has, however, been possible to relax the weekly ration tohousehold consumers from 2 cwts. a week to 5 cwts. a fortnight inmost parts of the South0      In certain other areas within easy reach of the coalfields, notably in Scotland and the Midland Division,rationing has been lifted entirely;    it will probably be possible to dispense with it throughout the country shortly after Whitsunc

still 109As regards the public utilities, although there wgas companies and 9 electricity worhs with not more than two weeks&apos;reserve o*f coal in the week-ended 20th April, public utilities&apos;stocks have been rising steadily, if slowly, for the country as awholeo      The total stock at gas undertakings for the week ended20th April was 1,950,000 tons, and in the case of electricity works2,065,000 tons (excluding the Dagenham stock of 171,700 tons).The supply position of the industrial undertakings, unlike thatof the merchants and public utilities, is not affected by a seasonaldecline in demand.     On the contrary, there is every indication thatthe coal requirements of industry are increasing as a result of the acceleration of war production,,Exports.Notwithstanding a considerable scaling- down of Italian &apos;coalrequirements by the Italians owing to their shortage of sterling,and the diversion to France of shipments previously arranged for the scandinavian markets, -the combined needs of the Allies are so great that considerable difficulty continues to be experienced in meetingthe demands of other countriescWeek ended1940.Corresponding week1939.TonsTonsCargo Shipments,13th April20th     5127 th     &quot;(provisional)585,700524,200673,000634,GOO713&apos;, 800826,600Bunkers for foreigngoing vessels.Week ended194-0,TonsCorresponding week1,959,Tons13th April20th     &quot;27th     &quot;        (provisional)158,700154,200160,500116,800144.200195^800l ptal^uantlty of coal shippedabroad.(including the coalequivalent o&apos;f coke and manufactured Fuel.13th April20th     &quot;27th     &quot;       (provisional)835,200716,100871,500796,300931,9001,065,500Coal Production Council0Lord Portal has now visited the majority of colliery districts&quot;including all the larger ones,  and joint committees of owners and workers have in each case been formed to co-operate with the coal production Council.
