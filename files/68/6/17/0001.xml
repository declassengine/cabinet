Mackenzie King, but also in the defeat&apos; of Dr. Manion, leader of theConservative Party, and of his deputy, Mr. Stevens. The new Parliament isexpected to meet on the 9th May.In an address to the Canadian people, when the result of the poll was known.Mr. Mackenzie King said : &apos;&apos; The result is the proof that you felt that a vigorousunited war effort by a united Canada was necessary above all things not onlyeffectively to aid Britain and France in the struggle to preserve freedom inEurope, but also to preserve true freedom in our own land.&quot;The provincial election in Alberta has resulted in the return to power ofMr. Aberhart. though his Government will hold office with a reduced majority.The appointment of the Earl of Athlone as Governor-General has beenreceived with enthusiasm.   He is expected to take up his duties in June.2. Naval, Military and Air Activities.The Canadian Government have offered to send a military expedition toGreenland, primarily for the purpose of ensuring the safety of the cryolite mines in that country. The United Kingdom Government replied, expressing their appreciation of the offer and their hope that the Canadian Government would proceed with the plan, but suggesting that the United States Government shouldbe informed before any action was taken. The Canadian Government have mentioned the matter to the United States Government, whose reactions to the project were not very favourable, and the proposal is still under consideration.Arrangements are being made between&apos; the Governments of Canada and newfoundland for discussions to take place in St. John&apos;s on questions relatingto the air defence of Newfoundland.It has been announced that a central air supplies depot, at which 1,500persons will be employed, is to be established near Montreal for the royal canadian Air Force and the Empire Air Training Scheme.[21237] ^ BPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (R.) (40) 137.May 3. 1940.
Mr. Rogers, the Canadian Minister for National Defence, accompanied bythe Master-General of the Ordnance of Canada, has arrived in this country forthe discussion of a number of defence questions with the United KingdomGovernment.3. Legislative Action.There have been no particular developments.4. Economic A ction.In view of the German attack on Norway, the discussions with the canadian government, mentioned in paragraph 4 (ii) of the previous report, for a controlbase in Canadian waters have been suspended.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.5. General Position.The coal strike continues, many thousands of Australian workmen being on strike against the industrial awards made by the Commonwealth ArbitrationCourt. If the matter cannot be settled otherwise, Mr. Menzies is determined to break the strike by putting into operation certain measures designed to dealwith offending individuals or groups. He addressed a mass meeting of minerson the 18th April, and. if there is no early return to work as a result of thismeeting, the Commonwealth and State Governments, in co-operation, intend to reopen several mines under police protection. The Prime Minister is confident that this will result in the early collapse of the strike.In his speech at the opening of Parliament on the 17th April, the Governor-General foreshadowed drastic measures against the subversive action of a small but militant body of Communists within the Labour Party.A split appears to have occurred in the Australian Labour Party, since mr. J. T. Lang (formerly Premier of New South Wales) is reported to have formed, and to be receiving support for, a new &quot; Non-Communist &quot; AustralianLabour Party. Australian soldiers recently attempted to wreck the head-quarters of the Communist Party in New South Wales.6. Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.(i) Navy. Twelve auxiliary mine-sweeping vessels are now in service andthree auxiliary anti-submarine vessels. The personnel of the Royal AustralianNavy now totals 11,579, of whom 6,778 are on active service.(ii) Army. Enlistments of reinforcements for the 2nd A.I.F. are proceeding.The second Brigade Group has left Australia and is due at Colombo about the3rd May; the third Brigade Group is due to leave Australia in about a week.Recent deliveries of war material for the army included 7 million rounds of small-arms ammunition and 15,000 cartridges for &quot;field and anti-aircraft equipment.(iii) A ir Force.-An order has been placed for the supply of 100 I)H. 82 TigerMoth aircraft and spare parts from England, required for the Empire air training Scheme to bridge the gap until local production of Tiger Moth aircraftbegins. An order has also been placed for the supply of 200 Gipsy Series I engines and spare parts to be fitted to Tiger Moth air frames being made locally.An overseas reinforcement pool for the Sunderland Flying Boat Squadronis bein&quot;&apos; formed in the United Kingdom.It has been decided to attach an Army Co-operation Squadron of the R.A.A.F.to the 2nd A.I.F., the aircraft to be supplied from the United Kingdom.7. Legislative Action.rn-ipi-A hnv-ft heen no particular developments.
8. Economic Action.(i) Manufacture of Munitions and Aircraft. The number of employees inGovernment munitions factories exceeds 10.000 and this number will be increased as more machine tools become available. The manufacture of trench mortars,predictor gear. Vickers machine guns and Bren guns is well in hand. A numberof armament annexes set up by the Government at the works of private and StateGovernmental establishments are now coming into production.Where possible without detriment to essential local requirements, suppliesof metals and other items for defence and essential purposes to other countries nfthe British Empire are being maintained.The Government have created an Aircraft Production Commission under theMinister for Supply and Development for the purpose of supervising the localproduction and maintenance of aircraft required for the R.A.A.F. programme.The Commission will control the manufacture in Australia of Beaufort, TigerMoth and Wirraway air frames and Wasp and Gipsy engines, and rates ofmanufacture will be accelerated.(ii) Exchange and Import Control. Action has been taken at the request ofthe Commonwealth Bank to ensure that, where desired, payment is made inforeign currency for exports to the Continent of America (excluding Canada andArgentina). Belgium, Switzerland, Holland and the Netherlands East Indies.(iii) Export Control. Exports of base metal alloys containing copper havebeen made subject to licence and exports of iron and steel products are also being restricted. Arrangements have been made for all shipments of wolfram andscheelite to be consigned to the United Kingdom with the exception of shipmentsunder two existing contracts to America which will be terminated on the30th June.(iv) Wool. Shipments of wool from Australia to all destinations to themiddle of February amounted to ahnpst 1,300,000 bales. Despatch of wool is proceeding rapidly to the United Kingdom and France and to many neutral countries.(v) Wheat. It is now expected that the total crop for delivery will be notless than 195 million bushels. Sales are proceeding slowly, while the shippingproblem, combined with the increased crop, has caused increasing difficulties withstorage.(vi) Shipping. Arrangements have been made to obtain, weekly, improvedfreight forecasts for estimated shipments of refrigerated commodities availablefor export to the United Kingdom, and it is expected that, as a result, the numberof loading ports per vessel in Australia will be reduced.NEW ZEALAND.9. General Position.Mr. Peter Fraser (Deputy Prime Minister) was invited to form a Ministry,on the death of Mr. M. J. Savage. On the 4th April he was elected Leader bythe*Labour Party caucus, but the names of the new Ministry are not yet known.A coal shortage is now being experienced, and the Government are makinginvestigations to ensure efficiency, and, if need be. will reduce rail services inorder to conserve supplies.10. Navcd, Military and Air Force Activities.(i) Navy. H.M.S. A chilles is still at Auckland undergoing refit. H.M.S.Hector has returned to New Zealand from Fanning Island. H.M.S. Leander isvisiting New Zealand ports, but is returning to Wellington prior to the assemblyof the 2nd troop convoy. The conversion of S.S. Monowai to an armed merchant cruiser is proceeding.(ii) Army. The second Brigade Group of the New Zealand Special force is due to leave New Zealand in a few days.[21237] B 2
(iii) Air Force. The total number of air crew candidates selected to a recentdate and classified as medically fit or temporarily unfit respectively is asfollows :  Pilots...............      889 and 233Observers       ............      185 and 53Gunners        ............      287 and 752.528 air crew applicants are awaiting interview.11 pilot officers recently sailed for overseas in company with 6 observersand 31 gunners.11. Legislative Action.There have been no particular developments.12. Economic A ction.Production of butter and cheese in the present season shows a considerable increase over the corresponding period of last year. Meat production has been maintained, although there has been a slight decrease in pig products. shipments of wool and primary produce to the United Kingdom are proceeding satisfactorily.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.13. General Position.The results of further provincial bye-elections show that the voting strengthof the Opposition has not been increased by as much as might have been expected.The terms of union between the Hertzog and Malan groups have now beenaccepted by the Provincial Congresses of each party in all four provinces; butcriticism has been aroused by speeches by Mr. Pirow and General Kemp,particularly in regard to their proposal that provision for &quot;forced labour&quot;(of the natives) should be included in the policy of the new Party.Mr. Pirow, in a recent provocative speech, also hinted that the time had come to form groups of &quot; storm troopers &quot; to protect the interests of Afrikaners.This was followed by the re-establishment in the Transvaal of an organisationknown as &quot; Handhawersbond &quot; on semi-military lines, but it is thought unlikelythat the organisation will attain important or dangerous dimensions, or be ofany political influence.The War Measures Bill, the most important measure of the present session,which sanctions the present Governments emergency powers and entrusts it with wider powers for the future, is being vigorously contested by theOpposition.An Electoral Law Amendment Bill has also been introduced, to put intoeffect the recommendations of a Select Committee. If passed, the Act wouldbe likely to have important effects, as it seeks to adjust electoral inequalitiesas between town and country districts, and would, for instance, give more seats to the Witwatersrand.14. Naval, Military and Air Activities.The total strength of all branches of the forces (excluding commandos) isnow 60,200.In response to the formal invitation from the United Kingdom HighCommissioner (referred to in the last Report), the Union Government have agreedto despatch a Brigade Group to Kenya, and preparations are going forward forthe move of this force at the end of June. The Brigade Group will be under the operational command of the General Officer Commanding, East Africa.At the same time the Union Government stressed the importance of adequate protection being provided in Kenya against air attack, since the political reactions in the Union would be serious if the Union Brigade were to suffer severe losses from such an attack; the Union Government pressed for modern equipment to beprovided for the three squadrons which they were prepared to send to Kenya and
for three anti-aircraft batteries to be established at Mombasa. While it hasbeen found impracticable to provide the anti-aircraft batteries, a certain numberof more modern fighters and bombers have been released from this country for theUnion squadrons, and the Union Government have agreed to despatch a fighter,a bomber and a general reconnaissance squadron to East Africa. The possibilityof the Union Government obtaining further equipment from the United Statesof America is under examination.Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, accompanied by financialand technical advisers, has left for the Union by air and is due to arrive on the30th April. He will discuss the possible expansion of air training facilities in the Union and any outstanding questions relating to the move of the threeUnion squadrons to East Africa.15. Legislative Action.Steps were taken during February 1940 in connection with the control of theUnion&apos;s trade and shipping. As from the 15th February imports into and exports from the Union and South-West Africa are subjected to control: under government Notice No. 48 of the 12th January no goods can be exported to anyneutral country in Europe other than Eire, Sweden, Portugal and Turkey unlessaccompanied by an export permit issued by the Department of Commerce and industries. No export permit is issued unless the intended consignee in Europehas given satisfactory guarantees against re-export, authenticated by a UnionDiplomatic officer or by one of His Majesty&apos;s Consular officers. Import control under Government Notice No. 73 of the 12th January is intended to ensurethat no goods are imported from any neutral country in Europe (other than Eire)unless they are accompanied by a certificate of origin and interest similar to that required by the United Kingdom authorities. The only exceptions to this ruleare goods detailed in the schedule annexed to United Kingdom Statutory rules and Orders 1505. Proclamation No. 28 of 1940 gave the previously-constitutedMerchant Shipping Control Committee the power to control the supply of coal for export overseas and to exact information from any person concerned with the exportation or maritime conveyance of any commodity from the Union.Proclamation No. 32 of 1940 applied to ships sailing from a port outside germany the provisions of the proclamation whereby masters of vessels may be compelledto discharge goods of German origin or interest.The censorship has disclosed very wide activities in enemy trading and though many of the transactions are comparatively small there is evidence thatthere are a large number of agents in the Union endeavouring to carry on business for or with firms in Germany. This information is conveyed to points whereaction can be taken and also to the Naval Intelligence authorities and the UnitedKingdom censorship and thus to the Ministry of Economic Warfare. There is evidence that there is a regular traffic in food parcels from America to Germanyvia Holland. It also appears that about 50 per cent, of the money sent from SouthAfrica ostensibly to support relatives in Hungary is used there to send foodparcels to Germany very often not even parcels but the money itself is sent tosome German address. Enquiries have been made by the Hamburg-Amerika Linewhether they can obtain coal at Lourenco Marques. Much German propaganda is entering the Union via neutral countries but being arrested by the censorship.A special secret organisation has been set up to deal with suspected secret writing.16. Economic A ction.The T.N.T. factory is expected to attain full output capacity by the endof April. The purchase of modern shell forging and machinery plant has been authorised.  The production of armoured cars and 3-7-inch howitzers has begun.EIRE.17.   There have been no developments of special importance.   The Govern-ment of Eire are showing firmness in dealing with the I.R.A.; two membersof the organisation who were in prison have died as a result of hunger-strikingAnangements have been made for a visit to London of the Eire Ministers ofSupply and Agriculture to discuss trade questions.
NEWFOUNDLAND.18. General Position.A section of the Press has instituted a &quot; straw ballot &quot; on the question ofrestoration of responsible government. Only 4,500 votes have so far been cast,but not one has been recorded in favour of retention of the Commission ofGovernment. The Newfoundland Government have not yet reported on thematter or indicated what degree of importance should be attached to this Pressagitation.The improvement in the employment situation continues; the number ofpersons in receipt of relief in March was 60,587, as compared with 80,739 inMarch 1939. The proposals which have been under consideration for thereduction in the imports of newsprint to this country, and the difficulty in providing shipping for iron-ore, are, however, causing the new found land government some concern.19. Naval, Military and Air Force. Activities.(i) Navy. The Admiralty have indicated readiness to accept a furtherthousand general service men when the present quota is filled.(ii) Army. The first contingent of 403 recruits for the Royal Artillery has arrived in this country.(iii) Air Force. It is probable that, in view of the number of recruitsalready accepted for the Royal Air Force and awaiting flying training, thenumber which can be accepted from Newfoundland will be limited.20. Legislative Action.A draft Special Areas Development Bill, which aims at giving effect tocertain long-range reconstruction proposals, has been under consideration by theCommission of Government.21. Economic Action.Applications for employment in the Mercantile Marine numbered 1,137 atthe end of March. The Ministry of Shipping is taking 200 able-bodied seamenat once to man certain Danish ships.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.22. General Position.There are no developments to report.23. Military and Air Force Activities.The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, visited Southern Rhodesia on his return from the Union of South Africa.The Southern Rhodesia contingent referred to in the previous report hasnow left to join United Kingdom units in the Middle East and the UnitedKingdom.Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-PojDham is to visit Southern Rhodesiaduring his stay in South Africa to discuss the progress of the Flying training schools. An advance party of Royal Air Force personnel has arrived in SouthernRhodesia and is engaged on the preliminary organisation of the schools.24. Legislative and Economic Action.There is nothing to report.
INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.25. Political Situation.There has been no material change in the general political situation duringthe past month. On the 12th April the War Cabinet, after finally consideringthe two lengthy appreciations of the political situation with which they hadbeen furnished by the Governor-General, decided to accept his view, reiteratedin the light of the decisions taken by the Congress at Ramgarh and by theAll-India Muslim League at Lahore towards the end of the previous month,that it would be inexpedient, at the present moment at all events, to take any action which might be interpreted as a change of policy or a concession to thedemands of the Congress. On the 18th April both Houses of Parliament, afterdebate, adopted resolutions approving the continuance in force of the proclamations issued by the Governors of seven Provinces under s. 93 of theGovernment of India Act as the source of their emergency powers to carry onthe government in the absence of ministerial advisers; but for these resolutionsthe Proclamations would have ceased to have legal authority at, or in some cases a few days after, the end of April. Since these debates public discussion inthe Press and elsewhere in India has naturally been much occupied withanalysing the underlying intentions of the Government speeches, which appearto have been subjected to much less acrimonious criticism than has been customarysince the impasse arose. All my information tends to show the existence inIndia of a strong and widespread desire for the emergence of some acceptablesolution and a somewhat shocked realisation of the width of the breach betweenHindus and Muslims, as indicated by the official adoption by the latter, withwhatever motives, of a polic)^ of Partition. Nevertheless, Mr. Gandhi and theCongress organisation have thought it expedient to issue from time to time during the month a series of pronouncements on the subject of preparations for civil disobedience and of the repressive action found necessary in variousProvinces against anti-war speeches and agitation. The precise intention ofthese pronouncements is difficult to estimate, but, even if this is not their primaryintention, they must have the effect of encouraging hopes of direct action on thepart of those who advocate it. The present view of the Governor-General andthe Governors is that early recourse to civil disobedience is still unlikely; but itis also the general view that, if it should be embarked upon, it would almost inevitably lead to widespread and virulent communal violence.26. Military Affairs.(i) At the request of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Government of india have agreed to despatch an additional Indian Battalion to Aden. This Battalionwill leave India for Aden early in May.(ii) At the request of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the services of 20 indian army Officers, experienced in Mountain Warfare, have been placed at the disposalof the War Office. These officers have been sent home by air and have now arrived in the United Kingdom.(iii) The Government of India have decided to take the following steps tostrengthen the Air Forces in India : (a) To speed up the completion of the existing Indian Air Force Squadron.(&amp;) To expand and reorganise a nucleus Army Co-operation Squadron of theR.A.F. as a light Bomber Squadron, convertible later to a mediumBomber Squadron,(c) To form a second Indian Air Force Squadron.The Air Ministry have welcomed the above proposals. The question whetherthe new Indian Air Force Squadron should be an Army Co-operation or a BomberSquadron has not yet been decided.(iv) The two Bomber Squadrons of the R.A.F. which were sent to Singaporefrom India just before the outbreak of the war have now returned to India andare shortly proceeding to the Middle East.(v) Supplementing previous orders, the Ministry of Supply have ordered50.000 rounds of 3-7-inch Howitzer ammunition.
s27. Foreign and Frontier Relations.(i) A afghanistan. After further consultation with the Government of Indiainstructions are being sent to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul, in accordancewith the recent decision of the War Cabinet, to approach the Afghan PrimeMinister with an assurance of British support in the event of Russian aggres-sion against Afghanistan. The question of granting credits to the AfghanGovernment for the purchase of armaments and for commercial development isunder urgent consideration. The Government of India have decided to offer the Afghan Government a credit of Rs. 10 lakhs a year for two years in the firstinstance to assist them in the improvement of roads.(ii) North-West Frontier. Another serious kipnapping case of five Hindus,of whom two were murdered, occurred in the Bannu District on the 3rd April,but the general situation in the Districts bordering Waziristan continues toimprove.The activities of hostile gangs in certain parts of Waziristan have beenthe cause of some anxiety. On the 6th April in North Waziristan scouts, assisted by aircraft, drove off hostile tribesmen with losses and captured a number ofprisoners. In South Waziristan troops operating in the Kotkai area haveinflicted casualties on hostile tribesmen and destroyed their caves. GovernmentForces have recently taken energetic action, both in Waziristan proper and inthe Districts, to surround villages with the object of making arrests of notorioushostiles.In the Ahmadzai Salient road construction proceeds apace, permanentpickets are nearing completion and a blockhouse on the central point at Daryobefor 8 platoons of frontier constabulary is half completed.(iii) Sinkiang. As a result of further representations, the Chinese Govern-ment at Chungking have instructed the Provincial Government that they must give an assurance that there will be no interference with the British wireless station at Kashgar. His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General has been instructed to returna firm refusal to any further demand by the local authorities that he shouldclose down the station and only to give way if a forcible irruption into theConsulate is imminent.(iv) Persian Gulf. Nothing of note has occurred on the Arabian coast ofthe Persian Gulf during the period under review.28. Indian States.Nothing to report.29. Economic.In the last report it was mentioned that the Government of India had undertaken to supply an additional million pairs of boots, to the order of theMinistry of Supply, by the end of the year, subject to the necessary accessoriesbeing sent from Europe. There was considerable difficulty in securing thenecessary supplies of grindery, without which the order could not be fulfilled, butthis difficulty has since been resolved through the action of the Minister of Supplyand the order is now being proceeded with.In order to acquaint themselves in greater detail with the requirements ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government for war purposes from India, the Government ofIndia have been deputing some of their technical advisers to this country for discussions with the Ministry of Supply and other departments. Thus theirSteel Adviser recently spent a month in this country explaining the natureof steel supplies that could be made from India and ascertaining the require-ments of tlis Majesty&apos;s Government and allied and friendly Governments. Theresult will be a closer degree of co-operation between the British and Indianiron and steel industries. India is now for the first time in a position to exportsteel, and arrangements are in hand to utilise her exportable surplus to thebest advantage by meeting from India requirements in various places from Malta to Indo-China and the Dutch East Indies, and thus relieving the strain uponsteel resources elsewhere.At the present time the Government of India&apos;s Wool Adviser is in thiscountry for a month and is having conferences with the Ministry of Supply in
regard to their requirements of various textiles and textile raw materials. TheEngineering Adviser of the Government of India will arrive in a few days on asimilar mission.The rise in prices continues to receive close attention. Upon the whole, thevigilance of the authorities appears to have had a sufficiently salutary effect uponthe tendency to profiteer in the necessities of life, which had shown signs of becoming serious in the early stages of the war, and drastic measures have riotbeen found necessary except in a few isolated cases. The cost of living, whichhad fallen after 1929, has not yet risen to an inordinate extent. It has, however,risen sufficiently to cause trouble with labour in some quarters, especially in thecotton industry. At Ahmedabad the millowners and the labour union had cometo terms. But in Bombay City the not unreasonable offer of the millowners was rejected by the workers&quot; under Communist influence. A strike ensued which involved delay in the execution of certain war orders. The strike has-nowcollapsed, and the result has been to the discredit of the Communist leaders.The prices of raw jute and cotton, both of which, especially the former, had risen under speculative influences to uneconomic levels, have now fallen to levelswhich may be regarded as fairly reasonable. Agriculture is relatively prosperous,exports have risen to a high level, and imports have been less affected by the warthan was at one time thought likely. Since the beginning of the war exports havebeen subject to control both from the supply and from the economic warfare pointof view; the question of regulating imports with a view to safeguarding exchange resources has been under consideration for some time, and the Government ofIndia, although they at first entertained certain apprehensions and objections,have now agreed to regulate and restrict imports from hard currency countries and will shortly put their plans for doing so into effect.The Government of India continue to respond readily to requests forco-operation in the prosecution of economic warfare. In particular they are being consulted as to the possibility of exercising pressure upon Japan with a view tothe conclusion of a war trade agreement and the hindering of German contrabandtrade through Russian agency over the Trans-Siberian Railway. Their attitude is helpful in this regard, and in order that they may not be bound by any eommit-ments in regard to the cotton trade which might be found to hinder the develop-ment of this policy, they have taken the important step of suspending the cottonnegotiations which were in progress between themselves and the JapaneseGovernment.30. Finance.Indian Budget. The Finance Bill was passed by both Chambers of theLegislature, with only one unimportant amendment. The last Finance Bill to be passed by both Chambers was that of 1934; in the intervening years the FinanceBills have had to be &quot; certified &quot; by the Governor-General. The passage of thisyear&apos;s Bill was facilitated by the absence of the Congress Party. The &quot; demands for Grants &quot; (equivalent to Votes) were all passed, save for a token cut relatingto Governments attitude towards the welfare of the scheduled castes. A separateExcess Profits Tax Bill, the introduction of which was mentioned in w.P. (R.) (40) 44, has also been passed by both Chambers.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma,31. General Position.(i) Law and Order.-Th.e situation throughout the country has in generalbeen quiet, but Hindu-Moslem communal rioting again broke out in Rangoon onthe 20th April, in which Hindus were the aggressors. The police quickly had thesituation in hand. The casualties amongst the rioters Avere 13 Hindus and Moslems killed, and about 150 wounded. Within the next few days nearly850 arrests took place, and the situation quietened down : but on the 28th Aprilan unprovoked attack was made by a party of Hindus on 4 Moslems and produced a crop of individual reprisals in the city. Though the police are taking stepsto break up any organised body of rioters, they cannot entirely prevent individual[21237] c
assaults. To prevent these purely Indian domestic brawls from affecting theBurman community, which, up to the present, lias kept aloof from them, despiteendeavours to drag it in, the Governor is considering the use of drastic action under the Defence of Burma Act to secure the deportation of such Indians, notdomiciled in Burma, as are shown to have taken an active part in the rioting.(ii) Political. U Ba Than, formerly Parliamentary Secretary in theCommerce and Industry Department, has taken over the portfolio of that department from the Premier.32. Defence.Nothing to report.33. External Relations.Nothing to report.34. Economic.(i) Internal. Nothing to report.(ii) External. Considerable quantities of rice are being exported to Japanduring the present &quot; busy season,&quot; owing, it is understood,&apos;&quot;to an exceptionallybad harvest in Manchukuo and other usual sources of supply.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this Report &apos;: Colonies &apos;&apos; is used to cover not only Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)GENERAL REPORT.35. Precautions against possible Italian Hostility.In view of the hostile attitude adopted by the Italian Government towardsGreat Britain in connection with the German invasion of Denmark and Norway,special secret and personal telegrams were sent on the 16th and 18th April, afterconsultation with the Foreign Office and War Office, to the Colonial governments which are within possible range of Italian attack, viz., Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus,Palestine, Aden, Somaliland, Kenya, Uganda, Zanzibar and Tanganyika.Colonial Governments had already been warned before the outbreak of war that,in view of the alliance between Germany and Italy, the possibility of Italianhostility could not be excluded, though it was expected that Italy would do herutmost to avoid becoming involved; and the &quot;Warning&quot; telegram sent toColonial Governments on the 1st September had authorised the adoption of the precautionary Stage against Italy as well as Germany, though it was impressed on Colonial Governments that it was most important that no action should betaken which could be considered provocative by Italy. The Precautionary Stageagainst Italy has never been withdrawn and is still in force, and the effect of the telegrams sent on the 16th and 18th April was to remind the Governors thatall effective precautions against a possible Italian move should be taken, though they were asked to bear in mind the need to avoid undue publicity and thespreading of the erroneous view that His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded warwith Italy as inevitable. A further telegram, reporting the latest developmentsfor the Governors&apos; information, was sent on the 26th April.circular 36. Action on German Invasion of Denmark and Norway.telegrams ofApril 9 and 16, In accordance with the approved policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, allt19!0- Danish ships in Colonial ports are being seized in prize.The detention of Norwegian ships at Colonial ports, pending considerationof the general problems arising out of the control of such ships, led to temporarydislocation of Colonial trade in certain areas, e.g., in regard to the rice trade of hong Kong and Singapore and the bauxite trade of British Guiana, but these
difficulties appear to have been removed by the progressive relaxation of restric-tions on the movements of such ships. The question of Singapore&apos;s petrol supplies is still causing some difficulty in view of the restrictions upon Norwegian shipscalling at Netherlands East Indies ports; but such ships are now being permitted to go to Dutch sources of supply provided that not more than two tankers are inDutch waters at a time.A circular telegram was sent to all Governments on the 1.3th Aprilnotifying them that the provisions of Trading with the Enemy legislation nowapplied to Denmark. The Danish firm, the East Asiatic Company, has numerousbranches throughout the Far East, and their position is under active considera-tion. For the present, they are being allowed to trade with other concerns in theBritish and French Empires and neutral countries subject to the ordinaryrestrictions.CircularMaritimetelegrams No. 1of April 19and No. 2 ofApril 22, 1940.CirculartelegramNo. 42 ofApril 13, 1940.37. Military Affairs.It has now been decided to transfer to East Africa, as soon as shipping canbe made available, three battalions each of the Nigeria Regiment and Gold CoastRegiment, Royal West African Frontier Force, with ancillary units. The moveis not likely to take place, however, before June.It has now been decided that the War Office should assume complete controllie., administrative and financial as well as operational) of the forces in british somali land. The exact date of the transfer of administrative and financial control is to be settled later.Secretary ofState&apos;stelegrams toGovernors,Nigeria(No. 338) andGold Coast(No. 246), ofApril 16, 1940.Secretary ofState to governor, tele-gram No. 53,Secret, of\pril 20, 1940.38. Industrial Relations.The rapid growth of industrialisation in many of the Colonies during recentyears, and the development of the trade union movement coupled with a growingsense of class-consciousness amongst the workers, has confronted the colonial governments concerned with a whole range of new problems. It was inevitable that the rather rapid development of this labour movement should be accom-panied by difficulties and disturbances of various kinds, instances of which willbe found in the latter part of this monthly Report. For a long time past in theColonial Office we have been aware of this new problem looming up, and havebeen impressing upon Colonial Governments the necessity for ensuring thatsuitable machinery is set up to provide for the adequate supervision of theconditions under which labour is employed, to redress any legitimate grievanceswhich exist and to effect wherever possible an amicable settlement of any matters in dispute between employers and employees. A considerable amount of progressin this direction has been made during the last three years; the number of labourdepartments or inspectorates and the number of labour officers employed in them has been more than trebled (nearly 100 such officers are now at work in some27 colonies) and a very large volume of new labour legislation (trade union,trade disputes, conciliation and arbitration, workmen&apos;s compensation, minimum wage, minimum age, &amp;c) has been enacted. The importance of there being a steady development of this work during the war period was emphasised in a circular despatch addressed to all Colonial Governors at the end of last yearand the information since received shows that this advice is being followed byColonial Governments generally. But I am afraid we must face the fact thatno amount of foresight or preventive action can safeguard against disturbancesarising during what is a relatively early stage in the history of self-conscious and class-conscious Colonial labour.39. Economic Action.(a) Exchange Control.The system has worked satisfactorily during the month under review. Therehave been no special developments.(b) Export Licensing.      ^As a result of recent events, no export licences are being issued from theColonial Empire to any Scandinavian or Baltic country.[21237 j c 2
The Colonial Office is in close touch with the Ministry of Economic Warfarein order that any arrangements come to as a result of War Trade Agreementsmay immediately be put into effect through the export licensing system.Colonial export licences are at present still being granted for Japan withoutrestriction except for a local restriction in respect of rubber and tin exports from Malaya, but the whole question is under consideration in connection withthe proposals for extending Contraband Control in the Far East.The views of many Colonial Governments have now been received on thequestion whether the work of Colonial export licensing should be concentrated in London, as has been suggested by certain trade representatives, or continue tobe worked mainly from the Colonial Dependencies concerned. There is so fara practically unanimous opinion on the part of Colonial Governments in favourof the latter, that is to say, the existing, course.(c) Supply of Colonial Products to the United Kingdom and France.The Treasury have agreed that in the special circumstances of the war specialpreference certificates for Colonial sugar may be issued for the year 1940-41 up tothe maximum number sanctioned by the Finance Act, 1934, that is to say, inrespect of 380,000 tons, notwithstanding that the price of sugar has risen above 7.?.per cwt. In peace time the number of special preference certificates which couldbe issued was subject to reduction when the price of sugar rose above this figure.The Treasury have agreed to the stabilisation of the number of special preferencecertificates during the war on the condition that their concurrence is obtained before a price is fixed for further purchases of Colonial sugar. Negotiations forthe purchase of next season&apos;s crops have now been started by the Ministry of FoodSugar Division. It is the intention that, as in the case of the present season&apos;scrop, the Ministry should purchase the whole Empire exportable surplus of sugar.(d) Shipping.Shortage of shipping tonnage remains probably the greatest single economicdifficulty facing the Colonial Empire. There is, however, some evidence that theacuter local shortages which were an inevitable feature of the early months ofthe war are being relieved, and the shortages now reported relate chiefly toisolated small trades where there are particular reasons which make it difficultto provide tonnage. Examples are the copra trade in the Western Pacific and theguano trade from the Seychelles to New Zealand and South Africa. I am. ofcourse, in touch with the Minister of Shipping with regard to all these individual cases.Reports on Particular Colonies.40. Northern Rhodesia:  Strikes of Copper-Mineworkers.Reference was made in Section 39 of the March Report to the strike whichhad broken out among the African employees at the Mufulira and Nkana mines.The strike, in which some 15,000 workers were involved, was accompanied by agood deal of violence, culminating in an attack on the 3rd April by a crowd ofabout 3,000 strikers upon the Mine Compound Office at Nkana, where some150 Africans, who had remained at, work, were drawing pay. In reply to questions in the House of Commons on the 10th April I gave a full reportof the circumstances in which it became necessary for the Officer in command ofthe Troops to order them to fire. In the. course of the disturbances thirteenstrikers were killed and seventy-one wounded, of whom four subsequently died.Two British officers and eighteen African privates of the Northern RhodesiaRegiment and four European and seven African members of the Northern Rhodesian Police were injured. Order was quickly restored and apart fromisolated acts of violence no further disturbances took place. The strikers returnedto work within a few days of the affray. The most disturbing feature of the troubles is that they would appear to be due at least in part to racial feeling between the African workers and the European, the former putting forward a demand for increased pay at rates of between 5s. and 10s. a day, whichapproximates to that paid to European employees. This has not been * granted,but the African employees are drawing the extra cost of living bonus of 2s. Qd.a month announced by the Mine Managements immediately before the striketook place.
42. Cyprus.The  Governor  reported  that  on  the   12th  April  about   600   personsdemonstrated in Nicosia in protest against a revised scheme&quot; for relief work.The police dispersed the crowd and 56 persons were arrested and charged underthe Criminal Code with unlawful assembly.   The Governor was convinced that Governorsa few extremist agitators were compelling a large body of men to refuse the ^leg11&apos;^&quot;^relief work which was being afforded, and that a dangerous centre of labour ^unrest was being created in Nicosia.   The Defence Regulations were invoked to No. 179 ofenable the Governor to confine the ringleaders to particular villages.A scheme subsequently submitted by the Governor involving the expenditureof  25,000 on unemployment relief during the present year, in addition to the 15,000 already spent, has been approved.No. 178 ofApril 12, 1940,April 13, 1940,and No. ISO ofApril 13, 1940.43. Malta.On the 2nd April it was reported that Sir Charles Bonham-Carter, theGovernor of Malta, was in hospital with localised pneumonia, but was stilladministering the Government.It was considered desirable that special arrangements should be made for administering the Government of Malta, and Major-General W. G. S. Dobbiehas been appointed to the command of the troops in Malta with the acting rank of Lieutenant-General. General Dobbie will assume the officeGovernor.of Acting44. Ceylon.There has been an epidemic of strikes amongst the Indian labour employedon the tea estates in many of the high country districts in the Island. It isgenerally admitted that there is little, if any, economic basis for this unrest,and the present disturbance of the traditional peace and good feeling on the estates may be partly attributable to the upsetting effect on labourers of therestrictions imposed in India on the free movement of labourers between Indiaand Ceylon. There are, however, local political reasons for the strike, the chiefof which is the formation of certain new Trades Unions, which are seeking toestablish their position in particular areas, and the counteraction which is takenby other interested organisations to retain their own membership.   One of theThe possibility of the strike having been due in some measure to instigation Goveri0[&apos;trtunbv enemy agents had been considered, but the Governor states that there is no ^re10l rtundefinite evidence on this point. April 9, 1940.A Commission of Enquiry into the disturbances is being appointed with thefollowing terms of reference : &quot; To enquire into and report upon the causes and circumstances of therecent disturbances in Northern Rhodesia and matters relating thereto, andto make recommendations.&quot;Its Chairman will be Sir John Forster, who is Deputy Umpire under the UnitedKingdom Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, and who has acted as Chairmanof Arbitration Tribunals and of a Court of Inquiry appointed under theIndustrial Courts Act, 1919, to investigate the London Bus Strike of 1937. he also presided over the Trinidad Labour Riots Commission of 1937. The othermembers are Sir Walter Buchanan-Smith, C.M.G., M.C., formerly Lieutenant-Governor of the Southern Provinces, Nigeria; and Mr. A. Dalgleish. an official ofthe Transport and General Workers&apos; Union. It is also contemplated that threelocal assessors should be appointed to represent respectively the viewpoints of the mine Managements, the European employees and the African emploj^ees.41. West Indies.The proposal for bringing unemployed West Indian seamen to this countryfor recruitment as deck hands in the Merchant Service has been foundimpracticable. It is hoped to engage seamen in the West Indies on vesselsplying regularly in that area.
most active new Unions is under suspicion of Communist influence. The prospectof a general election to the State Council, in which the labourers&apos; franchise hasan important influence in several constituencies, is also a contributory cause ofthe unrest. The Governor and the Minister of Labour in Ceylon are endeavouringto promote a settlement by conference and conciliation measures.45. Malaya.A further contribution has been voted by the Legislative Council of theStraits Settlements of one million pounds to His Majesty&apos;s Government as a gifttowards the cost of the Imperial defence of the British Empire, and the gratefulacceptance of this gift by His Majesty&apos;s Government has been communicated tothe Legislative Council.46. Aden Protectorate.A British representative has now arrived at the Yemen capital, Sanaa, to conduct with the Yemen Government the negotiations for a settlement of out-standing frontier questions relating to the Aden Protectorate-Yemen frontier.As was expected, he reports that he finds the Yemen Government to be no morewilling now than they have been in the past to reach a final settlement regardingthe whole frontier, including the disputed areas of Shabwa and Al Abr on thesouthern edge of the desert north and west of the Hadhramaut. A status quoagreement may be possible in respect of those areas.The latest report from the Governor regarding the unrest in the Hadhramautis that Bin Abdat, the wealthy aspirant to an independent status in the presentdomains of the Kathiri Sultan, has failed to answer the charges made against him and remains in defiance of the local authorities. The month given to him in which to comply with Governments demands has expired and action was tobe taken against him with air and ground forces, after the customary forty-eight hours&apos; notice, on the 24th April. Fuller information of any developments willbe included in the Report for May.47. Palestine and- Transjordan.(a) General.Jewish propaganda against the Land Transfer Regulations continues, andprotests have also been made against (a) the publication of the ImmigrantsHigh Com-     Schedule for April and May on the grounds that it is totally inadequate (although,secret telegram *n ^act&apos;      cluota announced provides for approximately 3,000 immigrants over no..r3766ofr &apos;   these two months, and for approximately 9,000 immigrants over the next sixApril 27, 1940. months provided that illegal immigration is checked), and (b) sentences imposed by the Military Court on eight Jews in connection with the seizure of armsat Ben Shemen colony.   The illicit Hebrew transmitter has continued to broad-cast attacks daily against the Government policy generally and the Police inparticular.   (The increased tension found expression in bomb outrages by Jewsagainst seven empty motor-cars in Jerusalem on the 5th April, which, althoughstill unexplained, are believed to have been perpetrated as a warning to thosewho had neglected to pay emergency levies demanded by the Jewish organisa-tion from all Jewish car owners.)   Meanwhile internal party differences persistin Jewish circlesReference is made below to a guarantee by the Palestine Government of bankadvances to citrus growers. An announcement was also made during the monththat the Rural Property Tax on citrus would be reduced, and both these proposals were greatly welcomed by Arab and Jewish growers.The improvement in labour conditions has been maintained throughout themonth; public security continues to be satisfactory.The situation in Transjordan is normal.(b) Assistance to the Citrus Industry in Palestine.Urgent representations were received from the High Commissioner forPalestine that the banks in Palestine had refused to make this year the seasonaladvances for cultivation expenses without which many of the orange growers areunable to maintain their groves during the summer months.   The banks&apos; refusal
was based on the grounds that war uncertainties made it doubtful whether the advances could be recovered from the sale of next season&apos;s crop. The High Oom-missioner accordingly asked for authority to guarantee advances by the banks forthis purpose. I was at first inclined to the view, which was shared by theTreasury, that, the cultivation advances being a normal commercial practice, thiswas not a proper case for Government assistance, and further that the with-holding of advances from uncreditworthy growers would have a beneficial effecton the industry as a whole, which at present has a productive capacity altogetherin excess of the demands of the markets which are now open to it. The High Com-missioner replied, however, that, if cultivation cxdvances were withheld, a verylarge part of the Palestine orange industry would be irreparably ruined, and, inview of these further representations, discussions were held between members ofthe Colonial Office and Treasury and of the three principal banks operating inPalestine at which agreement was reached upon the terms of a guarantee by thePalestine Government of bank advances to citrus growers for cultivation expensesduring the current season, limited to a maximum liability on the part of theGovernment of  340,000.
