Thirty-second Weekly Report on the Oil Position.3.PTIONT.VILThe only important change in the stocks of petroleum heldby the Services was an increase of 50,000 tons in the stock of aviation fuel.     The stock of this fuel now amounts to590,000 tons compared with L76.OOO tons at the outbreak of war.On the civil side there was only a small increase in thetotal stocks of all products compared, with last week.The number of tankers which arrived in this country duringthe week was twenty-two of which five were engaged on admiralty service.     The total was lower than for several weeks owing tothe variations in the movements of ships.Particulars in respect of the past four weeks, togetherwith the weekly average for the three pre-war months and foreach of the three-monthly periods of the war are set out inTable II.The total quantity of all products imported during theweek (Table III) was 231,900 tons - the lowest figure recordedfor the past six weeks.     The forward programme for the four weeks ending 11th May (Table V) again shows a downward tendency.While the immediate situation may benefit in some degreefrom the diversion to this country of some tankers which were on the way to Denmark and Norway., it is not yet possible topermit Norwegian and Danish tonnage to proceed freely to neutral loading ports and this will involve some interferencewith arrivals in the near future.     Steps are being taken to divert British tankers to neutral loading ports so as to permit of more Norwegian and Danish tankers proceeding to Alliedloading ports.It is difficult to make any accurate appreciation of future developments pending the clarification of the Norwegiantanker position.     So far as can be judged at present this isnet developing unfavourably, and every effort is being made bythe Allied shipping authorities to come to an earlyarrangement with the Norwegian Government and owners.Total deliveries for consumption of all products were rather higher than the average weekly consumption in the past few weeks.The following tables are appended:-Table .   I. Stocks (a) Service.(b) Civil.Table II, Tanker arrivals.Table III, Tonnage of imports on weelcLy basis.Table IV. Tonnages imported during past five months,Table     V. Forward programme of tanker arrivals.Table VI. Consumption from civil stocks.
