In the margin beside each item are placed percentage figuressnowing its comparative importance in relation to the total propaganda ineach of these four directions. In brackets after each figure is shown thecorresponding percentage for the previous fortnight.A table is then given summarising the relative importance of these various lines of propaganda.Finally, there is given in an Appendix a summary of the confidentialJ^Paganda &quot;Leads&quot; issued by the Propaganda Offices of the Nationaljjoeialist Party and of the German Labour Front during the months of member, October and November 1939.10813-1   [20599] B
The principal events reacting upon German propaganda durijjijlast fortnight were (a) The scuttling of the Graf Spee on the 17th December;(b) The air battle off Heligoland the next day;(c) The Christmas holidays.The principal lines of German propaganda during the past fortwere, in order of their importance- (1) British Weakness.(2) German Strength.(3) British Brutality and Unscrupulousness.These three themes between them comprised more than 50 per the total of German propaganda. Next in order, but of nine!importance, came British mendacity and French weakness.Anti-British propaganda has slightly declined, while anti-Fpropaganda has once more increased its relative importance. At thetime there has been a revival of propaganda designed to drive a vbetween France and Britain.There has also been a growing stress, in propaganda for Germanconsumption, upon the theme of the Allies&apos; responsibility for the war1.

In accordance with the technique, the story was illustrated by the personal narratives of particiin the battle.

This is the most important charge made in propa-gauda for home consumption, and is especially emphasised in the exhibition &quot; Robber State England &quot; at Munich.ost of this line of propaganda is summed up in the phrase &apos;&apos; Britishls a permanent aggression against the whole world.&quot;Wpt lAes\he main items in this section reflect those in &quot;German Strength.&quot;British accounts of the Graf Spee battle and, more especially, of theoand air battle were refuted with constant repetitions., st &apos;&apos;ies of the alleged capture of the U-boat Commanders Prien,, u&apos;tze were contrasted with their return from successful expeditions.1 e British accusation that Germany is sinking defenceless fishing boats.wu1&apos; by reaffirming the &quot;well-known fact&quot; that theseare used as patrol boats and minesweepers.[20599 1tofishingGermany, 20% (20%)Britain, 13% (18%)France, 16% (14%)Neutrals, 14% (16%)Germany, 7% (7%).Britain, 10% (8%)France, 6% (11%)Neutrals, 7% (8%)B 2

Emphasis was also laid on those passagCount Ciano&apos;s speech which appeared to accept the thesis of Allied resibility for the war.The growth in importance of this argument is greater than the fiindicate. &quot; Extraordinary emphasis has been laid upon it in the Gepress and in other printed propaganda.

Germany offers Friendship to France.This line, like the previous one, has strongly revived in piopadirected to France. The story is still that Germany and France can livefully side by side.   The sensational statement was made that Meinshould not be regarded as verbally inspired : &quot; You are too logicalunderstand that Mein Kampf, being a human worlv, has its human this instance an echo of the popular anti-French sentiment which pi&apos;in 1924.....The mistake consists in transforming the effect of temcircumstances into something perpetual.....Times change.&quot;A sign of the times has been the establishment of a &quot;FrenchStation &quot; operating within Germany.13. French Weakness.The main stress in this type of argument is laid upon Franco s ec,weakness. The Anglo-French Economic Agreement is either dendepicted as slavery for France.Prominence is also given to reports of defeatism.

Reports illustrating Turkish weakness, which were noted in thelast Analysis as the possible indications of a coming storm, havebeen maintained although no sensational development has yetoccurred. Attention is still paid to the assembly of a Franco-british-Turkish force in the Middle East, but no increase hasbeen noticed in propaganda pointing the anti-Russian moral.I he interesting suggestion has been made that Russia, followingher Baltic technique, might demand a naval base from Turkey.Uwing chiefly to the coincidence of Christmas increasing stress hasbeen laid on the support of the German Churches.*he Western  Powers  are  threatened  with the creation  of  aEurasian Bloc &quot; comprising Germany, Italy, Russia and Japan.

Secondly, attention is (levalmost exclusively to three main themes : British war guilt, British brutand unscrupulousness and British mendacity. It is evident that erordinary importance was attached to the implanting of a eonvuhoiBritish war guilt during the first two months of the war.September 1939 (prepared probably mid-August).More than half of the space is devoted to anti-Polish material deasto show the fantastic provocation and intolerable brutality of the bailPoles, who owe all the small culture they possess to Germany.

She showed that, despite herestations, nobody was more concerned to preserve the spirit of Versaillesherself.   She has plunged the world into a blood-bath in order tomain a state of affairs in Danzig and the Corridor which had been&quot;eraned ever since 1919 by British statesmen themselves.Chamberlain, who had pretended to be &quot; the flying angel of peace,&quot;&apos;.&apos; mask fall when he said that &apos;&apos; he hoped to see the day when Hitlerbe destroyed.&quot;   England was interested in Poland only as a substitute the lost thirty-five divisions of Czecho-Slovakia.

Britain&apos;s accusation thatlany would not negotiate is no more than a transparent excuse,mm made many proposals for negotiation on the Polish question, whichall rejected, and the very existence of which was sometimes simplyed by Great Britain.Great Britain&apos;s aim has always been to destroy Germany as a militaryeconomic competitor.
