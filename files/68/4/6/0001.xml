Copy No........IWAR CABINET.The Colonial Empire.Fifth Monthly Report submittedby the Secretary of State for theColonies, covering the periodDecember 1st - 31st,1939-(Previous Report - W.P.(R)  (39)  (100))Note.  In this Report &quot;Colonies&quot; is used to cover not only colonies in the strict sense, but alsoProtectorates and mandated territories;  and &quot;colonial governors&quot; is used to includeHigh Commissioners and theBritish Resident, Zanzibar.PART I - GENERAL.1*    Utilisation of Colonial Man-Power.After considerable inter-departmentaldiscussion on the various questions involved thecomplete draft of the report on the utilisation of colonial man-power referred to in previous monthlyreports, was submitted to the War Office in themiddle of December, and is now under considera-tion in that Department.Further consideration has been given, inconsultation with War Office,  to the questionwhether arrangements should now be made tofacilitate the enlistment here in the Army ofvolunteerslar tel.35t *f.39.

volunteers from -the&apos; Colon! es.The most pressing need is still for skilledtradesmen of certain categories, and the questionwhether cost of passages should he paid In respectof volunteers belonging to categories most urgently needed here is still under examination.As regards other volunteers, however,  thegeneral position is that while their readiness toserve is much appreciated,  the need, for them is notsuch ...present as to justify special arrangementsfor the pajTnent of their passages to this country.Colonial Governments were reminded^, that the limiting factor is not man-power (except in certain specialcategories) but equipment.The War Office are considering whether incertain areas where there are considerable imperial forces  (e.g. Malaya and Egypt) arrangements shouldbe made to establish training units for volunteersdrawn from neighbouring countries.In the meantime, however, any volunteersbetween the ages of 20 and 35 who proceeded to thiscountry at their own expense to enlist in the army will be accepted without limitation of number,subject to their being passed physically fit by theprescribed board here.    Special arrangements have beenmade to facilitate the enlistment of volunteersfrom the Colonies at the appropriate recruiting office in Great Britain.Colonial Governments have already beeninformed that it is not desired that non-EuropeanBritish subjects should come here for enlistment.The

The question how thi&apos;s aspect of the matter can hebest handled is one which I have left to the discre-tion of the Governors, but I have suggested thatit would be helpful if all applications forenlistment should be made to Governors in thefirst instance.      This would not only enable them todecide whether the volunteer in question can be spared from local defence requirements or from local industry but would enable arrangements tohe made for preliminary medical examination andwould permit of unsuitable volunteers beingdissuaded from coming to this country.2.    Military Expenditure in Africa.As a result of discussions between theColonial Office,  the War Office and the Treasury,decisions have been taken in regard to the provi-sion of funds to meet the large increase in military expenditure which has taken place in east and West Africa.    With minor exceptions,financial responsibility for all military expendi*-ture in East Africa will rest with the War office as from midnight 31st August/lst Septembers1939,but East African Governments will make fixedcontributions to the United Kingdom Government.The contributions payable by East African Govern-ments in 1939 are fixed in such a way that their total military expenditure in that year will be equal to the amounts provided for ordinary and special military expenditure in their approvedMilitary estimates for 1939.    In 19h0 and in following years their contributions will,subject to minor adjustments, be equal to theamounts

amounts provided in their 1939 estimates for ordinary military expenditure plus 25 per cent.    Itis, however, open either to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment or to any East African Government to proposesome modification in these contributions if thefinancial position appears to warrant it.    Expendi-ture on naval and civil defence and on air unitscontinues as a charge on East African Governments.Practical difficulties have prevented the acceptance by the War Office of similarresponsibilities in West Africa, but it has beenagreed that His Majesty1s Government should assumeliability for all military expenditure both ordinaryand special incurred during the current year subjectto a contribution by the Governments concerned ofan amount equal to that provided in their approvedestimates of ordinary and special expenditure during the year.    As regards subsequent years, HisMajesty&apos;s Government would similarly assume liability for all military expenditure subject to an annual contribution by the Governments concerned of anamount equal to that provided for ordinary expendi-ture under the military head in the approvedestimates for 1939 (or 1939-40 as the case may be)plus 25 per cent.In the case of both the East and west african Dependencies the arrangements have been made without prejudice to the ultimate settlement of the incidence of this expenditure, which will beconsidered when the time comes for the Governmentsconcerned

concerned once more to assume financial responsibility forthese services.3.      Enemy Aliens,.,   Repatriation.      The repatriation ofcertain enemy aliens from Tanganyika has been proceeding satisfactorily, biit difficulties have recently arisen Inregard to securing satisfactory assurances from the FrenchGovernment that their Kaval Authorities will not remove anysuch persons from the ships in which they are beingrepatriated.      A nuiiber were recently removed at Dakar, andin another case one of a number of Jewish refugees being transferred from Gibraltar to the united Kingdom was removedat Casablanca.      Strong representations are being made to theFrench.4.      Economic measures.      The Colonial Defence FinanceRegulations continue to function smoothly, and no difficulty is experienced in keeping them generally in line with anycurrent changes or modifications that are made in the UnitedKingdom Defence Finance Regulations.The question of devising satisfactory means to secureforeign exchange from Colonial exports to countries withdifficult currencies has been receiving farther consideration in consultation with the Treasury and the Bank of England.The two commodities which are at the same time the most difficult and the most important are tin and rubber,  and theBank of England have now opened conversations with the trade organisations concerned on these subjects.  It is contemplated,when arrangements regarding these commodities are complete,that two United Kingdom commodities which are important-exports to the United States should be selected for similar treatment,    If the arrangements made in respect of rubber and tin prove satisfactory,  they will be extended to ether exports

in tacColDrrial Bmpiie vfoichat present are generally paid for in sterling, for instance, East African sisal.    Lessdifficulty is experienced in dealing with,commodities of which the marketing is not sohighl;?- organised and in some cases the colleetionof foreign exchange through the operation of theexport licensing system is already, so far as can be  ascertained, working without much inconvenience.With regard to other aspects of exportlicensing, the progress made in the matter of rationing has not been rapid, hut it seems possible that this will become less important as and when war trade agreements are concluded withcertain European countries.      For instance, as aresult of the recent agreements with Sweden andBelgium,  it has been possible to authorise theGovernments of the Straits Settlements and Ceylonto issue export licences in respect of rubberfreelj/- to these countries without reference to theSecretary of State in every case.Import control continues to give riseto a certain number of problems.      The questionof the treatment to be accorded to French imports into the Colonies in view of the recent financial agreement, with France is under consideration.The Japanese Ambassador has lodged a protest thatthe imposition of import control in the CongoBasin area is contrary to the Convention of st. Germain;    the reply to him is still underconsid.eration, but there is no doubt that import control

control must Toe principally justified on thegrounds of vital necessity.      For various reasonsarising out of the interests of the localpopulations it is in any case desirable to treatJapanese imports into the territories within the congo Basin area ra.ther more leniently than importsfrom many other foreign countries and thepossibility of making some concession and secicringan equivalent concession in return from theJapanese Government is now under examination,It is hoped that the apprehensions ofthe Canadian Government regarding the restrictionsplaced upon Canadian imports entering the west indies have been allayed.      It is very satisfactory to report that the Trade Agreement between canada and the West Indies, which, having been denouncedbjr the Government of Canada earls?&quot; In 1939, was dueto expire on the 31st Decembei&apos; hasbeen renewed atthe suggestion of the Dominion Government for an indefinite period subject to denunciation at sixmonths&apos; notice by either side.At the request of the Ministry of supply the export of&apos; Colonial wolfram ores to anydestination except the United Kingdom and france has been prohibited.Sales of the West African cocoa crop bythe Cocoa Control set up by the Ministry of roodhave proceeded satisfactorily during the month andthe local arrangements in connection with the

scheme are now completed.      Market prices continueto &quot;be satisfactory.      So far almost all sales havebeen to the United States, but a &quot;rationing1&apos;&apos; system for continental neutrals is under consideration.It is important that the European markets for west african cocoa should so far as possible be maintained.Arrangements have been completed for the marketing of the Gambia ground nut crop;    HisMa3esty&apos;s Government has undertaken to endeavourto provide shipping space for the whole cx^op (about50,000 tons of undecorticated nuts) and to meet allfreight charges above 60/- pex&quot; ton dead, weight.This has- enabled, the buying firms to pay togrowers a fixed pruce of  5 per ton at port.    Thispx&quot;ice is slightly less favourable than that paid bythe French Government for the Senegal crop, andi^oughly ecjuivalexat (after making the necessary adjustments) to that paid for the Nigerian cx-op.There has been no further change in the rubber quota.      The price in the United Kingdom has risen and is now fairly steady at a little under1/- per lb.      This is still somewhat below theparity of the prices in the East and in the UnitedStates of America, but less so than a month ago.The discussions with British owners of rubberplantations referred to in the last Report were successful in bringing larger supplies to the UnitedKingdom market in spite of the continued premiumin

in the United. States.The tin quota for the first quarter of1.940 was finally raised to 120 per cent, early inDecember.      Simultaneously the maximum price   orders in the United Kingdom and Malaya were withdrawn andthe price of tin in London rose sharply from the controlled price of  230 to about  275 per ton.It then fell slowljr but prettj&apos; steadily to  250and is now fluctuating between  245 and  250 with aslight discount on forward tin.The marketing of East African sisal to european neutrals is under examination, and theintroduction of a &quot;rationing&quot; system is being discussed..The situation of the European maizegrowers of Kenya is becoming unsatisfactory partly owing to the difficulty of finding sufficientshipping space for the remainder of the present cropand partly owing to the fact that the presentUnited Kingdom price for East African maize (20s.to 21s. per quarter, f.o.b.) is some 2s. below whatthe growers regard as the minimum economic price.The question of price is being explored with theMinistry of Pood.The export of the Palestine citrus cropstill gives ground for anxiety, mainl3*- owing to thegreat shortage of shipping space.      I recognise, ofcourse, the very great difficulty that -there wouldbe

be in releasing additional British tonnage for moving the Palestine citrus crop at the present time.Steps are, therefore, being taken in the ColonialOffice to explore all other possibilities beforethe matter is taken up formally With the Ministry ofShipping.      The principal uncertain factor is theamount of -neutral tonnage that can be secured loythe Palestine shippers.      On this point precise information is hard to obtain and a telegraphicreport on the s^^object is being awaited from theHigh Commissioner for Palestine.      If this reportreveals that the situation cannot be sufficientlymet by any measures which the Palestine Governmentand the shippers themselves are able to take,  Ishall feel bound,  in view of the extreme importanceof this question to the economic and,  in consequence,political stability of Palestine, to make urgentrepreae.ntatl ons for the release of some furthertonnage for this purpose.Information was recently received from theMinistry of Shipping that they were preparing a programme of British and French shipping requirements for the whole of the next 12 months.      In order thatthe shipping needs of the Colonies might beconsidered at the same time as other- British andFrench requirements, Colonial Governments have,with the concurrence of the Ministry of Shipping,been requested by telegram to submit a d.etailedprogramme-lo-

programme of their shipping requirements.      when these programmes have been received, tiiey will hecollated together with the requiremeirts of thiscountry.PART H - PARTICULAR C0L0NIE-3:5. AFRICA.Kenya.office His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome has4957/291/159. received a Note from the Italian Governmentalleging that on the 7th December eight Britisharmoured cars, manned by regular askaris with machine guns, attacked 316 (Italian) Gelubba menat a point on the Kenya-Abyssinian frontier,killing twenty men, eight women and nine children,and seized all the livestock.

An Order-in-Council of the same date united the judiciaries ofthe Leeward and Windward Islands by establishing acommon Supreme Court.7. FAR BAST.Hong Kong.The Japanese troeps who had been operatingwn the borders of the Coleny had all left theneighbourhood by the 31st December.An agreement was reached with the Japaneseauthorities on the 1st December with regard to Britishand Japanese shipping between Hong Kong and Canton.Under this arrangement the number of permissible sailing:was increased from one British ship and two Japanesevessels a, fortnight to a similar number weekly in eachdirection.      Apart from this arrangement the sea-borne trade to Canton remains a Japanese preserve.The Japanese, however, closed the river completely(except for their own ships) from the 17th to the25th December for military reasons, and the agreement was,  therefore, in suspension during-that time.The Japanese have indicated their intentionte reopen conditionally the Pearl river, as well as-14. the

Twenty-two other memberof the same organizations are also being deported.A certain amount of unrest in the Colonyis reported to exist among Chinese labour, which issusceptible to incitement by misrepresentation ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy in the Par East.(b) Japanese fishing vessels.The licences of certain Japanese fishing vessels operating from Singapore, which were to havelapsed at the end of the year, are being renewed for six months,  though subject to cancellation withoutnotice

It has teen the policy forsome time past, for security reasons and in orderto encourage the enterprise of indigenous fishermen, tcaim at eliminating all fishing by Japanese powervessels in Malayan waters.      The number of licencesin force had been steadily reduced, and it was contemplated that by the end of 1940 this processwould be complete.      Energetic protests were receivedearlier in the year from the Japanese government through their Ambassador in London, and it has beenfound expedient in the interests both of the localfood-supply and of Angle-Japanese relations to makethe concession indicated above.Ceylon.The Government of Ceylon and the Governmentof India have failed to come to terms over their differences arising out of certain action taken bythe Ceylon Government in respect of a section of itsnon-Ceylonese daily-paid employees.      As theGovernment of India regard a satisfactory settlementof this question as an essential preliminary to theopening of the proposed trade negotiations betweenthe two Governments, the arrangements for thenegotiations are in suspense.Aden Protectorate.The second of the tribes against&apos;which air action was taken by the Royal Air Force on the17th November, has now submitted.The

Instructions have been issued that a senior British officer should be sent to Irqa in oneof His Majesty&apos;s ships with an escort from the local forces to proclaim the determination of the british authorities to apprehend the culprits and to prosecuteenquiries regarding a number of suspects.Aden-Yemeni Frontier.Arrangements are being made for an officer,now in the service of the Palestine Government with previous experience of the Yemen, to be released toundertake the frontier negotiations on behalf ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government.It has been decided that the cession ofShabwa or Al Abr, either now or in the future, cannotbe contemplated, and that, in the first instance,an attempt shoxrld be made to reach a settlementembodying the status quo of today.      If no progress can be made on these line-&quot;-, it is intended, in thelast resort, to propose to the Imam an agreement forthe neutralization of Shabwa and,  if necessary, ofAl Abr also, which would serve as a modus Vivendi ofindefinite duration.8. MIDDLE  AST.Palestine.Security conditions in Palestine continuedto improve throughout December.      Two successfulmilitary

military operations. In the Beisan area and on the&quot;border &quot;between the Haifa and Samaria Districts,increased general confidence in the restoration ofthe authority of the Government in the regionsconcerned;    there are, however, various small gangsof bandits still at large, particularly in the more remote country districts.      During the month therewas a steady increase in the recovery of arms bothby surrender and by seizure, especially in areas wherecollection had hitherto been difficult.In general it may be said that Governmentprestige is growing, although propaganda on behalfof the Mufti and the rebellion is still active,One indication of the improvement is the marked increase in the collection of local taxation, inspite of widespread unemployment.The \inemployment situation remains serious,especially as far as the Jews are concerned.      Thereis considerable tension in the Jewish labour marketowing to organised wage, cuts by the Revisionistlabour organisation, whose policy is hotly opposed by the General Federation of Jewish Labour.      Therehave in CQnsequence been a number of minor clashesbetween the two bodies, which have involved policeintervention.      The Vaad Leumi (the national councilof Palestine Jewry) are actively attempting to cope with the Jewish labour question, but their efforts are greatly impeded by party differences, and thepossibility

possibility of labour disturbances in futurecannot; be overlooked.Recruitment for the Auxiliary pioneer corps is progressing.      Of 1,200 men required, 600,the majority of whom are Jews, have been obtained.An encouraging feature of the situation isthe growing tendency towards better relations between individual Arabs and Jews, notably in the Tel-Avivarea.Trans-Jordan.The situation in Trans-Jbrdan continuesnormal.M.
