DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1940.SECRET. Copy No. 5QW.P. (R.) (40) 47.WAR CABINET.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Sixth Monthly Report submitted by the Secretary of State for theColonies, covering the period January 1-31, 1940.(Previous Report: W.P. (R.) (39) 100.)Note.-In this Report &quot;Colonies&quot; is used to cover not only Colonies inthe strict sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories; and&apos;&apos; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners and theBritish Resident, Zanzibar.Part I. General.1. Utilisation of Colonial Man-Power.THE Memorandum on the Utilisation of Colonial Man-Power (W.P. (G.)(40) 15), promised in previous reports, has now been submitted to and consideredby the War Cabinet. The Cabinet Conclusions were recorded in the Minutes oftheir meeting on the 25th January (W.M. (40), 23rd Conclusions, Minute 3).Since the Memorandum was completed the first detachment of forces fromthe Colonies arrived in France in the form of a Cypriot transport unit of476 officers and men. Plans for the formation of a Cyprus Regiment comprisinga combatant battalion with pioneer and pack transport companies are nearing completion. It has been decided to proceed with the recruitment of skilledtradesmen from Mauritius for service in Egypt.Enquiries are also being made as to the available supply of merchant seamenin the Colonies. It has already been ascertained that some 2,000 can probablybe secured from the West Indies if required.2. Censorship.The examination at Bermuda of mails carried by the United States Clipperservice was started during January and led to a suggestion in the United Statesthat the call of this service at Bermuda might be discontinued for that reason.The service is of great importance to the Colony and every effort is being madeby the Departments primarily concerned, i.e., the Censorship Department anp1the Ministry of Economic Warfare, to operate the control with the maximumspeed and the minimum inconvenience to the United States.3. Enemy Aliens.   Repatriation.The repatriation from Tanganyika of those enemy aliens whose detentionis not considered necessary in the interests of national security is continuingand a further 500 have been repatriated this month, together with about 120from Kenya. As a result of the representations to the French referred to inthe last report, satisfactory assurances have been received that the French naval authorities will not remove German nationals being repatriated under thesr*arrangements.[20767] b
4. Enemy Property.On the 18th January a comprehensive circular despatch dealing with thepolicy at present being pursued in the United Kingdom regarding the treatmentof enemy property was sent to all Colonial Governments. This circular despatchenclosed a memorandum on the subject prepared by the Board of Trade. It was accompanied by a confidential circular despatch giving some of the reasons forthe adoption of the policy. The open circular despatch asked Colonial Govern-ments to follow as far as was practicable the steps taken in the United Kingdom.Economic Measures.(i) Exchange Control.The Colonial Defence Finance Regulations continue to work smoothly.Instructions have now been issued to all Colonial Governments to make return?of foreign securities held by residents, which it is intended to requisition ifsuch action is taken in the United Kingdom, although not necessarilysimultaneously with action in the United Kingdom. Returns from certain colonial governments have already been received.Discussions on the best means of securing foreign exchange from Colonialexports have been pursued with trade representatives; a scheme for rubber isnow almost completed. In the meantime the condition on the export licencethat payment must be made in the currency of the country to which the goodsire exported is being relaxed in the case of Canada, France, Argentina and sweden in view of special agreements which have been made with these countries.(ii) Export Licensing.With regard to other aspects of export licensing, a great deal of detailed work is being done by the Colonial Office, and this enables the whole systemthroughout the Colonial Empire to be seen in perspective. On the whole, inspite of some necessary inconveniences to exporting firms, the system appearsto be evolving satisfactorily. A protest has, however, been received from theAssociation of West African Merchants, the gist of which is that applicationsfor licences should be submitted to and decided by the Colonial Office insteadof by the Colonial Governments concerned. On present data it appears thatthe proposals of the Association are impracticable.Cases are still arising where the Contraband Control is holding up consign-ments in respect of which Colonial export licences have been granted, but steps have been taken to ensure that a consignment with such a licence shall be regarded by the Control as having already been passed for contraband purposes. colonial governments have been directed to ensure that a duplicate of the export licenceshould always be attached to the consignment, or, failing that, that other clear evidence that an export licence has been granted in respect of the consignmentshould be in the hands of the master of the ship.Instructions have been sent to all Colonial Governments except palestine to refrain from granting export licences to Roumania until further notice, andto withdraw all licences already granted. The case of Palestine presents special difficulties and is still under consideration.(hi) Import Licensing.With regard to import control the question of dealing with French imports is still under consideration. On the advice of the Treasury and Board of Trade.Colonial Governments have been instructed to make no changes in existing policypending consultation with the French authorities which is about to take place.At the same time they have been informed that any ad hoc representations madeby the French authorities will be considered. It is hoped as a result of theforthcoming conversations with the French to make&apos; arrangements whereby anygrievances which Colonial Governments may have with regard to the treatmentof Colonial goods in French territory will be rectified.The Japanese protest at the introduction of import control in the Con-conventional Basin of the Congo has been followed by protests from the United Statesand Italian Embassies. The United States Embassy has also protested at theintroduction of import and financial control in Palestine. It is thought that theseprotests can be satisfactorily dealt with, and in the case of the United States the
shortage of exchange and the unfavourable balance of trade between palestine and the United States in the one case, and the Congo Basin areas and the UnitedStates in the other, themselves present a cogent argument against the Americanrepresentations.The Canadian Government have followed up their representations withregard to import control in the West Indies with similar representationsregarding import control in Fiji.uv) Supplies of Colonial Products to the United Kingdom.The marketing of West African oil-seeds has continued satisfactorily duringthe month, and the bulk of the Nigeria and Gambia groundnut crops has been purchased. The Ministry of Food continue to purchase all West African ground-nuts available, but they have revised their estimate of their requirements of palmkernels from West Africa, and up to 6,000 tons a month may now be released for other destinations. Owing to the shortage of shipping space stocks in WestAfrica are abnormally heavy.The shipping position has created difficulties in the West African cocoa trade.Space has had to be given up for oil-seeds, and although the marketing of themain cocoa crops in the Gold Coast and Nigeria is now practically finished, only very small quantities have been shipped. Sales in overseas markets have also beenslow; by the end of January only about 10 per cent, of the total estimated crophad been disposed of. There is thus the certain prospect of a large accumulation of stocks of cocoa in West Africa beyond the end of the marketing season, and storage difficulties may become acute.The price of rubber in the United Kingdom during the month has remainedsteady between ll%d. and Is., and a premium over the United States price has developed. The immediate outlook is not entirely satisfactory to the Ministryof Supply, largely because of big American purchases of forward rubber for thefirst two quarters of the year, but there are indications that this American buyingis now ceasing. A meeting of the International Rubber Regulation Committeewill be held on the 20th February to consider the rubber quota for the second quarter.New contracts for the delivery of the United Kingdom requirements of teaare being arranged between the Ministry of Food and the producers in ceylon and East Africa. The contracts cover 170,000,000 lbs. of tea from Ceylon, androughly 24,000,000 lbs. from East Africa, and shipments against them beganduring January. The price to be paid will be based on the average price realisedfor the three years before the war with an addition to cover increased production costs.Purchases of East African sisal are continuing satisfactorily under thearrangements made in November between the producers and the Hemp Control.Owing, however, to shipping difficulties, heavy stocks of sisal have accumulatedin East Africa, for which there is no immediate prospect of finding shipping space.The Ministry of Supply have made arrangements to purchase the whole woolclip from the Falkland Islands for the period of the war and one year thereafteron a similar basis to that adopted for the Australian and New Zealand purchases.The average price to, be paid is 11-218c?. per lb. ex store Port Stanley. TheMinistry of Supply have also guaranteed a minimum price of  125 per ton for the1040 flax crop from Kenya.The marketing of East African coffee is being considered, and the possibilityof increasing sales in the United Kingdom and France, in order to conserveforeign exchange, is being actively pursued.(v) Shipping.It is now clear, however, that the single economic factor which is likely to affect Colonial Dependencies most seriously during the present war is shortage oftupping. It is of little use the Dependencies producing large quantities of export crops if tonnage cannot be found to move them. The two areas which appear to be suffering most acutely from shipping shortage are Palestine andRast Africa.The difficulties of exporting the Palestine citrus crop were mentioned in myreport last month.  Since then active efforts have been made, both by the Palestineshippers themselves and by the Ministry of Shipping, to secure additional[20767] b 2
tonnage, and I am very glad to be able to acknowledge the most valuable help which the Minister for Shipping has found it possible to give in this matter.He has arranged for eight additional sailings from Palestine during the monthsof February and March, of which six will be British vessels and two Swedish,and these ships should be able, between them, to lift 342,000 cases of fruit. even with this additional help, and taking also into account the quantities of fruitwhich shippers&apos; have been able to send by way of Trieste and Marseilles, thePalestine citrus industry will still remain very severely affected by the presentshipping difficulties, but the situation is not quite so desperate as it was at onetime feared that it would be.The East African problem is less immediately acute than that of Palestine,but is probably more difficult to remedy. The chief trouble arises in respect ofthose products of East Africa which normally find a market in this country orin Northern Europe, since it is on this route that it is most difficult to secure theservices of neutral shipping. The products of East Africa are for the most partcommodities which, although they may be needed in this country, can also beobtained from other countries, from which shipping space is more easilyobtainable either because these other countries are nearer to the united kingdom or for other special reasons. An example is Kenya maize. Consequently, in thepresent extreme shortage of tonnage, the Ministry of Shipping are naturallyreluctant to release the full amount of tonnage which would be required to carry the whole of East Africa&apos;s potential exports. I am at present examining what measures could be taken, whether by way of reorientation of economic policy in east Africa or other means, to alleviate the position within the limits imposed bvshipping considerations.Replies are now being received from Colonial Governments to the telegrammentioned on page 10 of my report for last month asking for details of theirtonnage requirements over the next twelve months. These replies are beingcommunicated to the Ministry of Shipping, and I understand that they areproving useful in the working out of future shipping programmes.(vi) Supply of Foodstuffs to Colonies.The arrangements for controlling the supply of foodstuffs from this countryto the Colonies appear on the whole to be working smoothly.Part II. Particular Colonies.6. Africa.Lord Hailey&apos;s Visit to Africa.As has been announced in the Press, Lord Hailey is, at my request, paying a visit to a number of British Dependencies in West, East and Central Africa. Theprincipal and ostensible purpose of his visit will be to pursue in greater detailsome of the questions relating to Native Administration, with which he dealt ingeneral terms in his &quot; African Survey.&quot;In addition, however, Lord Hailey has agreed to make an unobtrusiveexamination of two other questions. The first of these is the important problemof the future development of unofficial African representation in legislative councils, in its relation to the evolution of indirect rule and the future develop-ment of Native Administration. It will be recalled that, in his &quot; African Survey,&apos;&quot;Lord Hailey emphasised the importance of preventing the system of nativeauthorities on the one hand and Legislative Councils on the other, from developingupon divergent lines with undesirable results.Secondly, Lord Hailey will make an informal study of native policy in the rhodesias and Nyasaland, with a view to advising whether any reconciliation ispossible between the respective policies of the Northern Territories and SouthernRhodesia.It may be mentioned that it was made clear to Mr. Huggins, the PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia, in discussions with United Kingdom Ministerslast year on the subject of the Royal Commission^ Report, that, while recognizingthe many advantages which amalgamation of the three territories would bring.His Majesty&apos;s Government could not commit themselves to the principle of amalgamation before a further investigation had been undertaken into thepossibility of reconciling the divergences in native policy.
7. West Indies.West India Royal Commission.Owing to the appearance in the press in this country and in Trinidad of reports concerning the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the publica-tion of this Report, I was obliged to bring the matter before the War Cabinet inan oral statement on Tuesday, the 30th January. The War Cabinet decided(W.M. (40), 27th Conclusions, Minute 2) that publication at this time would notlie in the public interest and decided to consider the publication of therecommendations only, whilst making it clear that the Government intended totake effective action to improve the situation in the West Indies. i will submit proposals concerning these matters as soon as possible. In the mean-iime, I am discussing the question with Lord Moyne and other members of theRoyal Commission with a view to securing their co-operation in the governments attitude, and the more important recommendations of the Commission are thesubject of consultation with the Governors concerned.Trinidad. -   . &apos;       - ;Unofficial strikes in the oilfields and in the sugar industry have ceased after Governor&apos;?;, -&apos;,negotiations between the Employers&apos; Association and the Trade Unions.  Higher *f jan^zf&amp;u)!wages to meet the increased cost of living have been conceded in each industry,and in the oilfields a wage agreement between the Employers&apos; Association and theTrade Union, which will remain in operation for six months after the end of thewar or for two years, whichever is the longer period, has been negotiated.Bahamas.I have accepted on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government a gift of  20,000 Governorv ^which the Legislature had voted as a donation towards Imperial defence. of^anuV, 1940.British Honduras.New proposals have been made to the Guatemalan Government with a viewto a settlement of the long-standing dispute between that Government and HisMajesty&apos;s Government in connection with Article 7 of the Anglo-GuatemalanConvention of 1859 which defined the boundary between Guatemala and british honduras.8. Far East.Straits Settlements Labour Disputes.Following the references last month to Chinese Nationalist propaganda andto a certain amount of unrest in the Colony amongst Chinese labour, there havebeen strikes amongst mechanics of the firm of United Engineers, Limited, at singapore, with sympathetic strikes at Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh; amongemployees in the pine-apple factories in Singapore and Johore; and amongcertain employees of the Singapore Harbour Board and the Singapore general hospital.The disputes have undoubtedly been fostered largely by the activities of the malayan Communist Party, which has not only attempted to break the Engineering-Mechanics&apos; Association by the formation of a separatist &quot; Red &quot; Union, but hasgenerally taken advantage of the present situation to exploit discontent arisingfrom increases in the cost of living, and to encourage demands by employees fora share in the alleged increased prosperity in certain industries.The Colonial Government, the Defence Departments, and all other public bodies had already granted extra cost of living allowances, dating from the1st November last (the allowance being subject to revision monthly in accordancewith fluctuations in the cost of living figure), and most employers of labour havegiven increased remuneration to their employees in many cases at rates even higher than the Government rates. Some employers have, however, refused tonegotiate on the receipt of unreasonable or extravagant demands from theworkers.The Chinese Secretariat and the Labour Department have taken all possible steps to obtain fair settlements of disputes and have succeeded in all except avery few recent cases.   The Police force, whose experience in such matters has hLstood them in good stead, have shown exemplary patience in dealing with the No.&quot;9^rjanl.23.strikers, and there has been no serious disorder.   &apos; o^ann^Ni940Governmentuse telegram
Ceylon.Governors ^ There have been signs of labour unrest on certain of the tea estates, andoTnov. HfiW several strikes of short duration have occurred. In only one case has strong Policeaction been necessary. The unrest is attributed to the activities of certainpolitical elements, with an eye to the State Council Elections which are to takeplace next year. The continuance of the Government of India&apos;s ban on emigrationof labour to Ceylon has no doubt contributed to the unrest and has made thetask of the political agitators easier than would normally have been the case.Neither the Governor nor the leaders of the tea. industry take a very serious viewof the disturbances, which ai-e unlikely to spread, but the future could be facedwith greater confidence if the ban on emigration of labour from India couldbe lifted.9. Middle East.Palestine.Com mi. i Improvement in public security and growth of Government prestige havete^ra^NcTsi continued throughout January. Cases of banditry and robbery persist, but fewerof Jan. 30, njio. large organised gangs have been operating, incidents of violence have been further reduced in number, outrages against the Government have practically ceased andarms have been recovered in large numbers from Arab villages. Arab political activity has also slackened. Although there is still propaganda and someintimidation from outside. Arab co-operation with the Government in measuresto promote peace and material prosperity is increasing.There were also two considerable hauls of arms hidden in Jewish settlements.Intelligence sources suggest that there are illegal arms in the majority of settlements; and the quantity seized in the above raids may indicate that previouslyaccepted estimates are too low.Party friction in the Jewish labour market has led to further breaches ofthe peace. Attempts are being made by Mr. Rutenberg, the President of theJewish National Committee, to secure agreement to a country-wide labouiexchange organization and a quota system.Organized illegal immigration, although it has been greatly reduced sincethe war, still presents a problem. The immigration law of Palestine providesfor the imprisonment of masters and crews and the confiscation of ships engagedin this traffic, but the ships concerned evade capture by unloading their passengersoutside Palestine&apos;s territorial waters into small boats which make their way toland, sometimes for as great a distance as fifty miles.With a view to defeating this device, arrangements were recently made witlthe Admiralty whereby the contraband service patrol in the Eastern Medi-terranean would intercept and divert to Haifa for contraband examination asan experiment one or two ships suspected of carrying illegal immigrants to palestine. A Greek ship, the steamship Hilda, was intercepted by one of HisMajesty&apos;s ships and brought to Haifa on the 23rd January under an armed guardShe was found to be carrying 728 Jews, most of whom were in possession ofCzecho-Slovakian or German passports with a collective visa for Paraguay issuedby the Paraguayan Consul at Prague. The Hilda has been identified as a shipformerly known as the A ghios Nicolaos, which had already succeeded in landingillegal immigrants in Palestine on more than one occasion.Besides being a bar to the orderly immigration of selected Jews in Palestine,the entry of large numbers of illegal immigrants constitutes a grave danger to public security in Palestine (1) owing to its effect on Arab feeling: and(2) owing to the risk of the infiltration by this means of enemy agents.I have accordingly authorized the High Commissioner to make use of the powers conferred on him by regulations issued under the Palestine (Defence) Order-in-Council of 1937 for the purpose of detaining the master, crew and passengers ofthe Hilda. These persons have now been removed from the ship and transferredto a concentration camp at Athlit, south of Haifa. The High Commissioner, onthe advice of the General Officer Commanding, proposes to intern a considerablenumber of the passengers as enemy nationals. I hope that action of this kindmay put a stop to the evil traffic in illegal immigrants.
Some tension was caused among the Jewish community of Haifa because the illegal immigrants who had arrived in the steamship Hilda were not allowed toand immediately on arrival. Jewish leaders were received and warned by theDistrict Commissioner and, apart from orderly demonstrations, nothing untowardiccurred.Although Arabs quickly expressed disappointment that the Jews had secured the lion&apos;s share of the Government grants and loans for the relief of unemploy-nent which were announced at the beginning of the year, the proposals were generally well received except by the citrus growers in both communities, whon their joint dilemma have made common cause to urge the Government tontervene financially to save the industry.   They have approached the HighCommissioner officially in a joint delegation and are now preparing a memo-andum stating their case.The situation in Trans-Jordan is normal.M. M.Colonial Office.
