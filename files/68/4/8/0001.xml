relatively small quantities as market conditions indicate.The opportunity of the presence with Mr. Crerarof Canadian officials on the economic side was used to clear up a number of points regarding our import restrictions, and it was also found possible just beforeilr.

COMIiONwBALTH OF AUSTRALIA.-(1) u-eneral Position.The Prime Minister announced in the House ofRepresentatives on 29th November that an Australian Division(&quot;The Second A.I.F.&quot;) would proceed overseas early in 1940.This was opposed by the Labour party, whose motion to reverse the Government decision was defeated by 33 to28 votes.The Leader of the Labour Opposition subsequentlydefined the policy of his Party as1.     ikn inflexible stand behind Great Britain.2.     The defence of Australia as a primary obligation.3.     Opposition to conscription and the sending ofmen overseas.4,     Avoidance of oppressive indebtedness.The Government has survived a second crisis which arose over a Labour motion for an increase in the rates of army pay.It is estimated that on a free vote 80% of australian Trade Unionists would approve of the despatch ofan overseas force and there is no reason to suppose thatthe recent crisis will adversely affect Australia&apos;s war effort.As a result of the creation of separate departments of Defence Co-ordination, Navy, Army, and Air, thefollowing Ministers were sworn in on the 13th November.Minister for Co-ordination of DefenceRight Honourable R.G.

(3)      Legislative Action.There have been no developments of importance.(4)     Economic Action.k Federal Economic Cabinet was constituted during november, the members beingThe prime Minister,  and Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence.      (The Sight Honourable R.G. Menzies,K.C.)The Minister for Supply and Development(Major the Right Honourable R.G. Casey).The Minister for Commerce. (Senator McLeny).The Postmaster-General and Minister for Repatriations(The Honourable S.J. Harrison).The assistant Minister for Commerce.  (Senator McBride).The Acting Treasurer.  (The Honourable P.C. Spender,K.C.)ar Expenditure.The revised Federal Budget presented toariiament shows a defence expenditure of A 62 millions,as compared with the pre-war budget estimate of A 33illions.     The average monthly outlay in September was 1.7 million;    October A 4.3 million;    November A 6 million.SL&apos;he expenditure will be met from the proceeds of threehort term loans from the Commonwealth Bank, amounting to 10 millions in all:    and from the proceeds of a publicoan of A 46 millions.     The balance will be met fromsvenue.     The only additional taxation envisaged will beIn connection with Customs duties,  the yield from which is[xoected to be A 150,000.In addition to the purely war expenditure a sum^- 2 millions will be spent on public workers having a-nsive value (e.g.  improvement of aerodromes, constructionlnland strategic roads,  increased rail facilities etc.Discussions

Discussions took place with Mr. Casey, during thelatter&apos;s visit to London, as to the assistance to begiven by the United Kingdom Government by way of loan towardsAustralia&apos;s expenditure on her Expeditionary Force and on her participation in the Air Training Scheme in Canada.Pol icy concerning provision of Equipment.The policy of the Commonwealth Government isto provide local defence equipment - naval, military andair - from Australian sources wherever possible, also asfar as may be done to meet the needs of New Zealand andthe eastern parts of the Empire.     normally New Zealandis supplied by Australia with assembled naval stores.The Admiralty is in possession of information as to thequantity of naval armament stores &quot;which could be furnishedfor the requirements of Hew Zealand and the eastern partsof the Empire.The Government of the United Kingdom has placed with the Government of the Commonwealth substantial ordersfor warlike supplies.      Similar orders have been receivedfrom elsewhere overseas.      The values run into somemillion of pounds, and the items involved include munitions,anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, footwear, uniforms, etc.iiiHgraft Engine Factory&apos;.The prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, has announced the intention of the Government to establish in Australiac; iactory for the manufacture of large aircraft engines.ihe factory, which would be impressive in scale and up-to-ate in equipment, would,  it is anticipated, assist eventually111 meeting the requirements, not only of Australia, but so those of the United Kingdom and certain Dominions.Exchange

Exchange, and Import Control.It is hoped that Australia&apos;s balances in Londonwill be helped in some measure by the United KingdomGovernment1 s purchases of Australian wool, butter, sugar,etc., and by the rather slower flow of United kingdom exports to Australia.This situation should be assisted by themaintenance of a fairly good level of gold production inthe Commonwealth, which for the year ended June 30th lastamount to     A 14,700,000.The Commonwealth Government announced that asystem of import licensing would be put into effect fromthe 1st December.Petrol Supplies.The hewnes shale deposits in New South wales arebeing rapidly brought into oil production.      Shortly10,000,000 gallons per annum are expected, rising later to perhaps double that quantity.     Ultimately it is hopedthat motor fuel supplies will be augmented substantiallyby benzole and power alcohol production.wheat Harvest.The harvest, it is estimated, will total160,000,000 bushels,  of which about 30,000,000 will be needed for home consumption.     The outlook is notreassuring in view of the ^probable difficulty of securingshipping space.The Government are planning a system of advancesof part of the value of the grain.     These will,  it isthought,  cost A 200,000,000.Economic

^oncrai c Pre a sure .Australia is co-operating in the various measures to bring economic pressure to bear upon the enemy.United Kingdom Statutory and war Trade Lists are being adopted and the control of trade with neutral countries isbeing adapted to that in force in the United Kingdom.Measures for the control of bunkers, etc., for neutral shipping have been taken and will be operated as required.

HgW ZEALAND.(1)    General Position.There have been no major political developments since the date of the last report.(2) Naval, Military and Air Activities.Navy.H.M.S. Leander which in addition to H.M.S. Wakakurais stationed in New Zealand waters, visited the AucklandIslands.     H.M.S. &quot;wakakura continues to carry out trainingof reserve personnel.      Three vessels have beendefensively equipped, and the Monowai has been commissionedas an Armed Cruiser.     H.M.S.

The latest information availableever points to the probability of the restrictions being-imposed at an early date.

UNIOil OF SOUTH AFRICA.(1)   General Posit.ion.The proposal for the formation of a new political.,arty eased on an &quot;Afrikaner bloc&quot;, by fusion of the group-bich follows General Hertsog and the nationalist Partyunder Dr. Malan, has not met with success and no secret hasbeen made of the failure of the conference called for thispurpose.The Nationalist Party will accept no &quot;wateringdown&quot; of the &quot;Republic&quot; issue;    on the other hand,eeneral Hertzog&apos;s group recognises that there are manyAfrikaners opposed to the idea of a Republic.      In consequencean attempt has been made by Mr. Pirow to devise someformula which will not specifically pledge the proposed newparty to &quot;exert itself to establish a Republic in SouthAfrica&quot;.     This device has, however, been rejected by theextreme Nationalists, and discussions are now taking placeon the question of &quot;removing all anomalies which hamperfull expression of National freedom&quot;.Meanwhile, a new party of General Hertzog&apos;ssupporters has been formed in the Transvaal, under the nameof &quot;Die Volksparty van Ti*ansvaal&quot;,  as a bridge to ultimateunion with the Nationalists.     The Hertzog group in the orange Free State, however, regard the new move as precipitate,and the general position is still obscure.The Government, as a result of the elections tothe senate held on the 17th November,  secured a majority oft?/o among the elected Senators:    this, witn the nominatedSenators, ensures the Government a comfortable majority inthat Chamber.There

There appears to be a growing conviction on the-art of a large section of the Afrikaner community that-fiipral smuts took the right line in regard to the warwith Germany.      While therefore some kind of workingagreement may be reached between General liertzog and the nationalists,  the Government remain confident that theresults will not be such as seriously to hamper them inproceeding with the effective preparation of South Africa&apos;swar effort.(2). Naval, Military and Air activity.Twelve trawlers have been commissioned asauxiliary Mine-sweepers and two others were requisitionedand completed in December.-      Two off-shore-whalershave been requisitioned and are being fitted as A.S.vessels.     Booms for both the new and the old basins arebeing fitted at Capetown.The Union Government have agreed to make available   accommodation and. maintenance facilities onshore for Reserve Aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm Unitsborne on His Majesty&apos;s ships in the bouth Atlantic.The coast garrison and active citizen force units have been further increased by 170 officers and,C00 other ranks of which 5,700 all ranks are now employedon a full time basis.&apos;    Further additional units of themilitary forces have been formed, including six  newbattalions, the First bouth African Irish Regiment,and.Engineer,cillery, Army Service and Medical Corps Companies.     Theadditional Infantry Battalions are being brigaded into two additional Brigades in the Transvaal.      2 25 officers andother rank students qualified during the month at theMilitary54S

Military College specialist and regimental courses.The strength ef the Air Force has been further increased by 32 officers and 250 other ranks,      3 civilflying clubs at Johannesburg and 3 at Pretoria are nowtraining 90 pilots.    A central flying school has beenestablished at Kimberley.      50 air gunners commencedtraining at Roberts Heights.At the beginning of December Generl Smuts met thePrime minister of Southern Rhodesia and the SouthernRhodesia Minister of Defence at Pretoria, when thearrangements for the defence of Africa were discussed.As the Cabinet are aware, the Union Government, afterthe meeting with the southern Rhodesia Ministers,  offered tosend one Brigade and several air squadrons to Kenya as a precautionary measure.     They were informed that, while itis not expected that the move of the Union brigade to Kenya.vould be required unless there were evidence of hostileMentions from Italy, we should welcome the despatch of Unionair forces as soon as the necessary accommodation and other-facilities can be prepared for them in Kenya.      Preliminaryreconnaissance is now being made of Great North Road fromPretoria to Nairobi.The Union Government have also offered to extendUnion Air Force training facilities to European Britishsubjects in southern Africa.(3) Legislative Action.A Proclamation was issued on the 23th Novemberimposing a censorship on all postal,  telegraphic and telephonecoamunications passing to and from the Union and South WestAfrica and all other countries except other members of theBritish Commonwealth.      Liaison is being established with the-aval Intelligence Officer at Cape Town and with the Unitedkingdom Controller of Postal and Telegraph Censorship.      Nocensorship is being applied to communications&quot;ithin the Union and South West Africa nor-17- to

to the local press, but the principal newspapers, whichor,e almost entirely dependent upon the South African PressAssociation - Reuters for their external news, have undertaken to avoid the publication of items received fromother sources which may appear to be undesirable.Broadcasting is in the hands of one organisation only andno censorship control has been placed upon it for thepresent, but the only news broadcasted is that suppliedbv the Government and the press Association.(4)    -Economic Action.Efforts have been made to obtain oil and coalfuel for enemy shipping in Portuguese East African ports.In view of this steps have been taken in the Union toprevent airy such supplies leaving the Union for the purposeindicated.A War Supplies Directorate has been formed todevelop local manufacture and to arrange supplies of alldefence stores and equipment.      The Small Arms Ammunitionfactory is being extended to manufacture tracer and armourpiercing ammunition and field gun cartridge cases and. gauges.Plant has already been acquired in England for thispurpose and is being shipped out in the next few months.    Alarge number of orders has been placed locally for themanufacture of munitions and general technical stores and bodies for M.T. vehicles.      3 inch infantry mortars are now-being produced Ideally at the rate of 100 per month.      A pilotmodel armoured Car has been successfully tested and theiinal design approved for manufacture.      Good progress isoeing made with a furnace for heat treating armour plateUP to 5 feet by 3 feet,  samples of 5 num. and 4 num. armourplate

plate having &quot;been produced to specification.Agreement has recently been reached between theUnited Kingdom and Union Governments whereby the formerundertake to support the Union Wool Market up to a fixedmaximum of  3,700,000, (representing the amount which germany would have spent on South African wool this year)if the price falls below an average figure correspondingapproximately to the average at which the United KingdomGovernment purchased the Australian Wool clip.     Theagreement with the Union is limited to one year and does not involve the United Kingdom sharing with the Union anyprofits which may arise from the disposal abroad of woolpurchased thereunder.Further agreements have now been reached withthe Union Government as regards the purchases by theUnited Kingdom of foodstuffs, e.g. butter and cheese.A shipping control committee has been set up.Economic Pressure.The Union Government has agreed to co-operate in the various measures for bringing economic pressure to bear upon the enemy.      Hew regulations have been issued to deal with the control of financial transactions with persons in enemy territory.

EIRE.The position and prestige of Mr.  de Valera&apos;sgovernment in Eire has been shaken hy recent events,lir. de Valera felt it necessary to release certain of theI.E.A.  internees who were on hunger strike after an initialrefusal to release them.    Subsequently the Eire Courts decidedthat the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act,under which members of the I. R. A. had been interned, wereultra vires as being in conflict with certain articles of theConstitution.    As a result, all the interned men, some 5h in number, were released.    The I.R. A.  also carried outeffectively an armed raid on an ammunition magazine situated in Phoenix Park, Dublin.    They overpowered the guards and carried away in many lorry loads about one million rounds ofsmall arm ammunition.    Intensive activities on the part of thePolice and Army authorities have succeeded in recovering.the^larger partof the seized ammunition, and a few men have been arrested andcnarged with participation in the raid.    Mr.   de Valera is alsoapplying to the Eire Parliament for further legislationconferring express powers of internment in a form whichpresumably is believed tc be legally valid and free from therejections raised to the previous legislation.A number of reports have been received recentlyegarding the possible intention of the I.R.A.   to carry out anrned raid against Northern Ireland.    It is thought that theses are more in the nature of vague threats and should not. &quot; accepted as indicating   that definite action of this natureIt is clear however that the I.R.A.  have recentlyreceive d

received considerable accession of strength, and prestige, and unless Ivir.  de Valsra&apos; s Government succeeds in re-establishing: ts authority and interning again the more dangerous members-f the I.R.A., further outrages are likely.The Naval Attache&quot; on the staff of the United kingdom representative to Eire has recently been on a tcur of inspection of the coast-v/atching stations set up on the Southand west coasts of Eire.    He reports that a serious effortappears to have been made to set up a useful organisation,tnough in some respects, in particular the provision of rapidmeans of communication,  the organisation is still deficient.The Eire Government have recently placed orders in this countryfor a number of motor vessels for coastal patrol work at atotal cost of approximately  250,000.

SOUTIIERN RHODE5IA.(1)    General Position.There are no developments to report.(2)    Military and air activities.Arrangements have been made for the Southern Rhodesiaiiinister of Defence to visit this country about the middle ofJanuary in order to discuss the question of the financing ofSouthern Rhodesia&apos;s war effort and the use to be made of theSouthern Rhodesia Military Forces and Air Squadrons.A Survey Unit for service in East Africa is being raised in Southern Rhodesia and will be available to proceed on service early in January.A Signal Training Company has been formed.    Theintention is f or. the Unit to supply trained signallers andtechnical wireless personnel to the Southern Rhodesia ServiceBattery and Reconnaissance Unit.    It is estimated that thepresent personnel will be fully trained by the middle ofFebruary, 19!i-0. .On further consideration,  the Air Ministry came tothe conclusion that it was desirable to establish three completeRoyal Air Force Flying Training Schools in Southern Rhodesia(each consisting of an elementary and an advanced trainingscnool) in place of this, schools referred to in the previous report.    This proposal has been accepted by the Southern rhodesia government, and detailed arrangements have been worked out wi with the Officer Commanding the Southern Rhodesia Air Force(Colonel Meredith)  during his visit to this country.Colonel Meredith is now on his way back to Southern Rhodesia,and

the Southern Rhodesia Government have been asked toorise the putting in hand of the necessary works as soon assidle after his arrival.(5)    Legislative action.There is. nothing of importance to report.(k)   Economic action.Discussions between the Southern Rhodesia authorities the Ministry of Pood regarding the purchase by the UnitedGdom Government of meat supplies from Southern Rhodesia areli in progress; agreement has not yet been reached on thestion of prices.
