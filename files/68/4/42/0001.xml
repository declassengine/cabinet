JTwentyjfirst weekly Report on the Oil Position.Stocks of petroleum for the Services show no appreciable,i -tre from those exhibited in last week&apos;s return.      The stocksnf fuel and diesel oil for the Admiralty are about 10 per cent,celov/ the figure prevailing at the outbreak of war.      On the5ther hand there has been a progressive increase in the Airi/inistry1 s stocks of 100 octane aviation spirit, which is now about 53 per cent,  higher than at the end of August last.:&quot;:-.ere has also been a marked improvement in the stocks oflubricating oil both for the v-&apos;ar Office and Air Ministry whichin each case represent about double the amount held at theoutbreak of war.      The War Office stock represents about 50 percent, of the reserves aimed at at the end of 1940 as against25 per cent, at the outbreak of hostilities.On the     civil side stocks of motor spirit are approaching the figure held at the outbreak of war and represent 18 weeks&apos;supply.     Kerosene stocks are higher than at that date.Considerable inroads, however, have been made on the stocks of fuel oil and this matter is receiving attention.The number of tankers which arrived in this country duringthe week was twenty eight, of which six were engaged on admiralty service.      This represents a considerable increase over thearrivals during the previous week but considerable fluctuations-n the weekly arrivals must be expected.      For example, the^rivals during the previous week were only sixteen, of whichfour were engaged on Admiralty service, whereas the presentnumber is the highest for any one week since the outbreak of war.Particulars in respect of the past five weeks, togetherY&apos;ith the weekly average for the three pre-war months and for september, October, November and December are set out inTable it.The increa:-se in the number of tanker arrivals is reflected

the tonnage of imports during the week shown in Table III,-&apos;e figure of 271,900 tons representing the highest tonnageluring the war.It will be observed from Table IV that only 64 tankers areected to arrive in the four weeks ended 24th February.    Theslowness with which the Norwegian tankers are entering into service continues to be a source of embarrassment.Table V showing consumption from civil stocks reveals afurther drop in the consumption of motor spirit which had goneap after Christmas.      This decline is probably attributable tothe unfavourable weather and the laying up of private cars asfrom the 1st January,      The present rate of consumption, viz.55,000 tons a week,  is about 25 per cent,  less than the Oil303rd&apos;s estimated weekly consumption of 70,000 tons on arationed basis*      The cold weather is responsible no doubt forthe increase in the consumption of kerosene and also for the decrease in consumption of vaporising oil used in tractors inconnection with farming operations.Following the issue by Post Offices and Local Taxation?ffices of Ration Books under the Motor Spirit Rationing Scheme,the issue of supplementary allowances to meet business or other essential needs for the period 1st February to 31st March is proceeding at all Divisional Petroleum Offices.The Following tables are appended:Table I.Table II,Stocks (a) Service(b) Civil.Tanker arrivals.Table In,    Tonnage of imports on weekly basisTable iv.Tonnages imported during past four months.Table v.Programme of tanker arrivals.Table VI.Consumption from civil stocks.
