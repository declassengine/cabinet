(this document 13rm miPROPERTY OFGO VERMONT)El 3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;&apos;SSECRETw.P.(r)(40) 44 Copy No. J)J)war cabinetINDIATENTH FORTNIGHTLY REPORT submitted by the Secretary ofState for India covering the period 16th-31st January 1940(Previous Report: w.P.(R)(40) 28)U.    GENERALNothing of importance has occurred during the part fortnight, except that Mr. Gandhi, basing himself on a speech recently delivered by the Governor-General in bombay, has sought a renewal of the conversations which came to an infructuous end some two months ago.   They areto meet accordingly on 5th February, and the War cabinet have separately under consideration the issues which ma;rbe involved. /II.    MILITARY affairs.       The Ministry of Supply have placed further orders on India for:50 million rounds of small arms ammunition100,000 hand grenades30,000 signal cartridges30,000 guncotton slabs40,000 guncotton primersand 10 tons of cordite a month.Ministry of Supply orders will absorb all India&apos;ssurplus production of ammunition and explosives until wellinto 1941.2. There is no change in the situation as regards theArmy or Air Forces in India.

III.    FOREIGN AND FRONTIER DELATIONSAfghanistanHis Majesty&apos;s Minister reports that Russia1sfailure in Finland has to some extent restored confidence in Afghanistan and that the opinion is now generally held that Russia is not likely to venture on an invasion ofIndia through Afghanistan and would not be successful if she did.   Public opinion is increasingly in favour of the democracies but it will take some time to remove the prevailing impression among the younger generation ofAfghans that Germany*s military and air forces areinvincible.   The public are beginning to realise that german broadcasts are quite unreliable and are comparingthem unfavourably with British wireless news.In the matter of trade the Afghan Government havenot accepted the offer made to them by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment for Afghan wool to be marketed in this country on the same terms as East Indian wools.    They have insteadoffered it for sale in Afghanistan at the best priceobtainable and it has been bought by Russian agents at abou&quot;40% above the maximum prices offered here.    It is not known whether the ultimate destination of the wool isGermany.As regards cotton, an offer has been made to theAfghan Government to purchase their cotton for this year at current Liverpool prices with a rebate of half the freight rates across India.   This offer will no doubt beof value as a gesture of goodwill on the part of HisMajesty&apos;s Government though it is doubtful whether it willbe sufficient to prevent the cotton from going to theGermans, who are reported by the Afghan Government to be willing to pay 50% above Liverpool prices.

Nothing to report.No on-7/8 st Frortt,ierSince the surrender of Major Duggal, referred to in last fortnight&apos;s Report, it has not yet been possible to persuade the Shabi Khel to comply with the remainder ofGovernment&apos;s terms although a deputation of Mahsud Malikshas endeavoured to secure a settlement.   A further attempt is to be made by the deputation during the present week.The Bhitanni tribe at a jirga on the 17th January madeits peace with Government, having surrendered all thecaptives demanded of them and bound its bad charactersunder security.There has been little improvement yet in the situationin Bannu District.   Here and in the neighbouring districts of Dera Ismail Khan and Kohat a number of incidents havebeen reported, including a serious raid on 25th January andthe ambush of a party of ten Frontier Constabulary on 26thJanuary.   As explained in a separate memorandum (&quot;T.P. (G) (40)23) the Government of India have further considered thebest means of putting an end to the unsatisfactory positionexisting, and as a result they have asked for approval tothe permanent occupation of an area called the nhmadzaiSalient, which experience has shown to be the centre of the trouble.   The proposals of the Government of India have beenapproved in principle on the assumption that they aresatisfied that occupation of the Ahmadzai Salient will involve no undue risk of leading to further trouble else-vshere in Waziristan.IV.
