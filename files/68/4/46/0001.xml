EMERGENCY SUPPLIES.The emergency measures outlined in the second supplement tothe Ninth Fortnightly Report have now been put into effect.    the speedy requisitioning of trains and ships already loaded with coal,and their immediate despatch to house coal depots and public utilities most seriously in need of fuel has temporarily relievedthe situation.   At the same time the movement of requisitioned coaltrains is reported to have eased the congestion in the marshalling yards and reception sidings.    Thus after two days (30th and 31stJanuary) of requisitioning coal en route9 it has been possible to resume more normal arrangements for the railing of coal direct fromcollieries to merchants&apos;  depots..Supplies have nevertheless been seriously curtailed in many parts of the country9 especially in London and the southerndivisions.    Accordingly the Department still finds it necessary to intervene in the supply arrangements in order to ensure the rapiddespatch of coal to the most hard-pressed areas.    The conditions have been so severe that some places in close proximity to mines have been short of coal9 and in other places there has beendifficulty in local distribution of coal actually in the depots.While avoiding as far as possible any further requisitioning(end its attendant financial difficulties)., the Department ispushing forward supplies from the Collieries to necessitous areas.Full trainloads of coal are being consigned direct from collieriesto a local merchant who will arrange for its distribution to consumers in his area.The dislocation of supplies, together with the substantial increase in consumption accompanying the recent cold spells hasinevitably resulted in a further deterioration in the stock positionof the public utility undertakings.,  especially those in London andthe southern sea-board.      Some electricity undertakings in the SouthEastern Division., for example, have been reduced to less than two weeks&apos;  supply.    As much help as possible is being given to thePublic utilities generally, and provided the weather does not

-2-xrtterfere with present arrangements there does nots  in spite of thedecline in reservess appear to he any immediate danger of a cessation of operations of these concerns for want of fuel.Although the high point of the present emergency seems at themoment to have passed.,  it is evident that the possibility of therecurrence of a critical supply position and a consequent reversion to large-scale requisitioning depends on the way in which the weather breaks in the immediate future.   As soon as the present coldspell is over and the dislocation of supplies can be remedied?  itwill be urgently necessary to make good the continued depletionof stocks in house-coal depots9 industrial concerns and publicutility undertakings.Emergency arrangements of a longer-term nature than those atpresent in force have already been prepared to deal with there-stocking problem,,    It must be emphasised,, howevers that it may take some weeks to clear up the transport dislocation caused by thepresent spell of bad weather9  the probable duration of which mustin the meantime give rise to much anxiety.Working conditions have now returned to normals following the christmas and New Year holidays.    The estimated quantity of saleablecoal raised for the two weeks ended 20th January was 99128s000 tons.This is 6379000 tons less than for the corresponding fortnight of1939j a decline which is attributable to the volume of absenteeismsillness and to transport difficulties.PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT.Item19401939Week ended13th Jan.Week ended20th Jan.2 weeksended20th Jan.2 weeksended21st Jan.TonsTonsTonsTonsestimated Quantityof saleable coalraisedI 4969190004S4379000! 9912350009,765.000

In January only 409000 tons leftr&amp;nce as compared with the 809000 tons available.    In consequencehere are now large stocks amounting to 409000 tons at the ports whichEmployment remains steady at around an average of 7599000,vage-earners3 though the total falls short of the correspondingaverage for 1939 by some 159000.    Working time at the pits is hackto normal9 the time worked for the fortnight ended SOth January mounting to 10o83 days as compared with 10.79 a year ago.

e congested.    The  railway stations inland are also full andansport from the woods has been stopped.Urgent enquiries are being made into the possibility of stockingt timber in the woods but at present it seems that this isadvisable.    In the meanwhile there is great danger that the Frenchrosters will be discouraged and that production of pitwood will11 off.    It must be remembered that it is only after constantfortsby the French Government that adequate supplies are now liable.    The need for ships is urgent.The position in the rest of the country in regard to suppliessteel supports has been eased by the purchase in Belgium of,000 tons of rolled steel joists by the Iron and Steel Controller,ese joists can be converted into pitprops but at least 509000 tonsall is required.WAGES.Provisional agreement on Mine Workers&apos; wages was reached at aeting between the Mining Association and the Mineworkers&apos; federation the National Joint Consultative Committee on the 18th january   1940.cording to this the Mine Workers&apos; wages would be adjusted atmonthly intervals by variations of the flat rate addition at the.te of 0.7d. for every point (subject to a minimum of five points)&apos; which the Cost of Living Index is higher or lower than when it was it fixed.The 0.7d. was calculated with reference to the wages of the lowerid men after deduction of certain fixed items.    As wages when adjusteddl be unaltered for three months9 it follows that no one in thetoing industry will get increases fully equivalent to the increase; the cost of living and that in the case of the higher paid mene difference will be very considerable.The first fixation under the formula would be made by reference the Cost of Living Index published in Decembers and would be inrce for the months of january  February and March.

The proposed agreement would be terminable by notice by eithere subject to the condition that the flat rate addition in April9and June would be determined by reference to the Cost of Livingax published in March.These terms would give an increase of 5do per shift for Januarysrusry and March against the previous (rejected) offer of the owners4do for january  pending discussion,of a formula for February andardSoWhere the district wages percentage is above the minimum9 thet rate addition will pro tanto reduce the percentage..    In manyortant districts this means that the wages bill will be no higherreason of the 5d.The Miners&apos; Delegate Conference on Thursdays S5th January9  1940ommended the acceptance of this offer by the districts;  to whomhas now been ret erred.
