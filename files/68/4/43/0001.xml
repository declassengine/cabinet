ECONOMIC SITUATION IN GERMANY.DECEMBER 1st - 51st,  1939.No significant developments appear to have taken place during the past month, except some increase in internal andeconomic and financial tension which appears to have becomesomewhat acute in the early days of January 1940 (See I (D)below, page 6.    Further information which has now become available makes it possible(i) To amplify some of the principal points that have been dealt with in precedingreports.(ii)To review the general economic problemthat confronts Germany after four months of war.I.PRESSURE OF ALLIED BLOCKADE.German policy and activities in the past monthreflect no serious change in her supply position.    There hasbeen a further intensification of the search for scrap iron;zinc baths can no longer be supplied to the private householder;and the domestic use of wood and timber has been furtherrestricted.    The lubricating oil in a captured Heinkel fighterhas been shown by analysis to be &quot;re-made&quot; oil. The populaceis asked to believe that a new type of coffee made from acornscollected by the Youth Organisation,  is superior to the importedarticle.    Neutral neighbours are wondering if it really isdesirable to import motor cars without tyres.    On the other hand,,highly finished engineering products of good quality are beingexported to Hungary; some textile materials to Yugoslavia, anda large number of goods to Holland, Belgium and Italy.Travellers returning from Germany report sometimes on theexcellence and abundance of foodstuffs, but more usually ontheir inadequacy and the difficulty of obtaining the fullrations._ The/^1   Wllll^llBMIIumi.......m.mm......mill _____ *

The weight of the indirect-evidence, such as thatquoted above, suggests that in a number of directions there arereal shortages in Germany-    No doubt part of the stringency whichis becoming observable is the result of official policy, but itis ho lonooroo- AAle to explain, the whole of it as being theresult of a preconceived plan to eke out accumulated stocks.An interesting byproduct of the blockale has beenthe development during the past month of what may turn out to bea great international racket in food parcels for Germany.    Thesystem is simple.   Kindly -and. well., disposed^individuals in theUnited States, for examplepay ji 8.50 to an American--domiciled,organisation.    This sum is used by the organisation to purchase in Holland and other adjacent neutrals food worth about      1&apos;o507which is sent by parcel-post into Germany       In this way the traffic evades-.expvjrt.llce-n.ee regulations.    The Yellowadvertisements and order forms which are widely-circulated, inthe UAS.A. do not mention Hitler and. carry no swastika emblem.They give the quantities of food, to he sent to Germany in grammesinstead of ounceso and this probably&quot;helps to .conceal the size of the swindle from the American public,    It is scarcelysurprising that correspondence between those organising thetrade,  describes it as offering tremendous opportunities for personal profit.    If it continues unchecked Germany will get a double benefit; an increased, supply of food, and a substantialprofit in American dollars..   But its propaganda value appears tobcuipii^--Ge.x&apos;c.an,    An American lady, writing to friends in Mnnich,asks if they are really so short or food as to make itnecessary for* these very expensive parcels to be continued.GERMAN EXPORT . TRADE;A very high level of .a ami r.i s t retire skill is still being maintaino i in the control of Ger.aa.r13r&apos; s export trade.There is no single policy but a scriee of different devicesare brought into play as the needs of    h    changing situationsrequire/&apos;

require.      Supplies of essential materials, such as coal and coke, have teen withheld from adjacent neutrals as a means of applying pressure.      Sweden has heen induced hy this method tosend waggons to fetch supplies and to ease the shortage of rolling stock in Germany.     Pressure has been put upon Belgiumby the same device in an attempt to induce her to give largersupplies to Germany.      In Balkan countries exports consist ofsuch things as agricultural machinery, or of materials for theconstruction locally of agricultural equipment such as silos,from the erection of which, using local labour, Germany obtainsthe maximum of foreign exchange for a minimum of her own rawmaterials.      In other markets exports appear to be predominantlygoods of high value, but containing only small quantities of deficiency products,  and with overseas markets an export tradein high value specialities is growing up through the parcel-post.The Reprisals Order in Council will,  once the necessaryexemptions to it have been exhausted, deprive Germany of themost valuable part of her export trade and she may be expectedto make great efforts to maintain it.      E?en where she does not get much now foreign exchange by selling her produce, she hasconsiderable inducements to continue to do do,      She can maintaincommercial goodwill; including that of agents and colonies ofexpatriates abroad.      In particular,  she has thrown upon theAllies the onus of preventing neutral firms with large blockedmark balances from liquidating their holdings by exporting fromGermany.      Some of these firms are powerful enough to be able to cause the Allied Governments considerable embarrassment if their interests are severely prejudiced, and they have every reason togive inducements to Germany to allow them to obtain expni-Lableproduce in part-payment of their claims.The great variety of methods of payment for exports whichhave been developed by Germany in the past five years, and the degree/

- a. -degree to which export trade has been controlled and exploitedas sn instrument of high policy, make the enforcement of controlover German exports a more complex and difficult tasks than the seizure of contraband imports.INTERNAL CONDITIONS, LABOUR AND WAGESThere appears to be considerable confusion in the presentsocial economic policy of Germany.The &quot;rapprochement&quot; with Russia is giving German propagandaa chance to hang its internal economic policy on an anti-capitalist peg.      The line now taken is that Germany is moving towards the development of a &quot;true&quot; socialist economy.      Inpractice this means an increasing curtailment of individualliberty of economic action.     Business is still privately owned,but its control is a matter for the State.     Private ownershipis tending more and more to disappear;    contractors become Stateofficials, the manager is simply the agent for compulsoryrationalisation measures.     Where a Government takes and spendsso high a proportion of the national revenue this, it isofficially contended, is a natural development.      One German papestates that in &quot;1933 the State absorbed h-7. 1$ of the Germannational income, and gave trade and industry 30yj of its orders.These two figures are mutually inconsistent but throw an interesting light upon newspaper opinion.The Press none the less urges private industrialists toshow more initiative in overcoming the difficulties of war-time conditions.      Obviously realising that the restrictions on profit(the &quot;unprofitability&quot; of industry was a common complaint even before the war) is at the root of the problem,  it often revertsto the distinction between unnecessary and demoralising warprofits on the one hand, and the minimum reward for efficientservice and initiative on the other, and clearly suggests thata slackening of industrial leadership and efficiency will be inevitable if the present trend continues.     Discontent among thebusiness/

ousiness class may be as great a source of economic--weakness asdiscontent among the workers.There continues to be plenty of evidence of sporadicdissatisfaction or worse among the working classes, and resistance,massive in character, to further reduction in wages appears to persist.     No reliable statistics of unemployment are obtainable;one million was mentioned a month ago, but it has probablyincreased.     Hamburg is perhaps the chief centre both ofunemployment and of outspoken discontent.     As might be expected,occupations dependent on shipping and overseas trade have suffered most, while the consumption goods industries (asevidenced by Press notices of bankruptcies and financialcifficulties) probably come second.Some significant, if not substantial, concessions havebeen made to labour in recent weeks.      There has -beer^a neductionin the wage tax;    overtime pay for -hours in excess of 10 hasbeen reinstated;    holidays will be permitted after January192-1-0, and it is announced that the powers conferred by theCivil Mobilisation Decree (passed in the earliest days of thewar) to move labour about at will and compel it to accept anyrate of pay, will in future be exercised only in exceptional circumstances.      There seems little doubt that these areconcessions to a widely expressed resentment and some passive resistance, made the more bitter as the much A^aunted victoriesof German arms lead to no improvement in internal conditions.Though their practical value to labour is not very great, any concession by the authorities is an encouragement to further pressure and serves to discredit the Nazis&apos; favourite theoryof equal sacrifice (and therefore equal discipline) for thefighting forces and the working men.      There is no indication,however, of any organised labour resistance.CD) /

\ internal financial, tensionThough the point should not he exaggerated,  there are clearsigns of an increasing evasion, at least in the large towns, ofthe price control system.     The heavy fines imposed for offences against it are so widely advertised as to suggest that evasion,or an acute fear of it developing, is general enough to needdrastic treatment.Reports have several times mentioned that the less plentifulfoodstuffs are &quot;being bought and sold privately at enormouslyincreased prices (e.g. coffee at Rm. 20 per lb.).     At the sametime the Press has complained of the craze for buying unnecessaryquantities of unrationed articles (e.g. potatoes and pins) toensure against possible future rationing.      Dr. Funk publiclyadmitted that purchases of unnecessary bath tubs were takingplace upon a ridiculous scale, and it now appears to be true tosay that there has been in the last few weeks a minor &quot;flightinto commodities&quot; - of a kind which, in a differently organisedsystem, might mark the beginning of the critical stage in arabid inflation.The utmost caution must be exercised, however,  in using thev/ord &quot;inflation&quot; in connection with these recent events.      TheGerman public still remembers, with emotions that are positivelypathological,  the events of 1923 when ten and one-hundredfold,increases in prices were common occiarrences v    Nothing like that liashappened now, nor is it likely to happen in the near future.Had there not been in the German administrative system asufficient number of persons who had experienced the previous&quot;inflation&quot;, the recent flight into commodities might have led toevents not unlike those of the post-war crisis.      Under present-oay conditions, however,  they have led not to a spectacular risein prices that would have profoundly disturbed the German public,hut to a more rigorous control over the whole banking andfinancial system.a/

A decree recently published,  gives to the Minister ofEconomic Affairs a complete mastery of the banking system.      Hecan amalgamate existing banks.;    close them down or build up new ones:    and. can abrogate all the rules governing the conduct ofbanking business in Germany.      This has been followed by theappointment of Field Marshal Goering as economic and financialdictator, and it is probable that action is pending by which aseries of forced loans and other methods of regulating theconsumer&apos;s income, will prevent any repetition of the recentflight into commodities, and will make any of the outward signsof inflation impossible so long as the administration is able tomaintain its grip over the v/hole of the industrial, commercial and private economic lives of the German people.      Financialand economic collapse of the 1918 and 1923 type is not therefore to be expected,  save only as a by-product of political and socialdisruption.) GEIdvLAN-RUSSIAN TRADE . -While it appears to be true that something which may becalled a trade agreement has been signed by Germany and by Russia,the whole weight of evidence of an unusually reliable charactershows that this agreement did not determine in detail futureRussian-German trade nor the quantities&apos; of commodities to be exchanged.      Instead it appears to have been only an authori-sation to Russian and German trading interests -to negotiate with each other and on both sides there seems to be singularly littlefreedom to reach ah agreement about particular transactiohs-without reference back to higher authority.   &apos; Both the russians and the Germans are driving&apos; a very hard bargain, and each ofthem constantly refers to the opportunities of obtaining from&quot;elsewhere the goods for which they ask.At the same time there is evidence that the trade abuuallypassing between the two countries is unexpectedly small.Arrangements/

arrangements were completed about the 23rd December&apos; to ship alarge consignment of oil before the end of January.      The first two train loads left Odessa between the 26th and 23th December,and were held up at Przemysl, whereupon shipments werediscontinued until towards the end of January.Russia has been turning bach German ships trying to enterLeningrad., and although arrangements have been made for tranship-inent of Russian goods across the Black Sea in German ships, thedifficulties of transporting them from Constanza do not appearto have been solved.      The Russians have insisted on rigorousterms for permitting the transit of goods from Rumania into germany via that part of Galicia which is under their control.No Germans may accompany the trains;    no livestock may be carried,and the trains, worked by Russian crews, must travel as fast as possible.Some shipments seem now to be going across Siberia.      TheJapanese are receiving small quantities of German exports, butare paying cash when the goods leave Konigsberg, and somequantities of Manchurian produce continue to be shipped.Although the Japanese are sending a business man to Berlin todiscuss this trade,  their &quot;Foreign Office has made it plain to itsAmbassador in Berlin that it does not attach any very special importance to this trade;    that it is willing to profit where itcan, but that no special privileges need be expected.Whilst after four months Germany has as yet got little of value from her economic dependence on Russia,  there have,nevertheless, been considerable opportunities for ind-AvidualGerman and Russian administrators and business executives todiscuss their common problems, and though there is, as yet, no evidence of steps actually taken, to improve equipment andtransport, nevertheless,  an accumulation of knowledge and.experience is being built up which may be turned to good account when/

when serious efforts are made to use it.GERMAN-BALKAN TRADEDuring the past month there has been some evidence of fresh&quot;out limited German initiatives,  designed to increase the produc-tive capacity of Balkan countries to the ultimate advantage ofthe Reich.      Krupps are reported to be trying to develop theproduction of cotton in parts of Yugoslavia.      Inducements toincrease soya bean production in Rumania are being continued, butthe Rumanian Government is now talcing steps to secure greaterprofits for its own oil factories and gives privileged treatmentonly to those growers of beans who have not entered intocontracts with German agents.      A large number of silos are tohe erected hy Germany in Rumania forthwith and. will be paid forduring the next seven years, and special agricultural machinery is now being sent.      Hungary is favourably treated so far asexports of machinery are concerned, and there have been someattempts to purchase and to develop small mines in Yugoslavia.Bulgaria still appears to be singled out for special treatment which takes the form mainly of additional supplies of aircraft and armaments-      Greece has been offered, daily deliveries of coalso large as to be impracticable if rolling stock is also to beavailable to supply Italy and other Balkan countries.      Takenin all,  these events are not upon a sufficient scale  bo suggestthat Germany will be able to draw very greatly increased supplies from this area, hut sufficient is being done to maintain theappearance of German economic power and. enterprise in the minds of the local population and trading interests.      Their response,however, seems to be dictated more by fear of military /action thanny ordinary oon.inerGi.aI considerations.      Most of them still pro-feas to a desire to emancipate themselves from that economicdependence upon Germany which trading methods of the past eight&apos;Jt ar s ha ;.r e j nd.uc e c..

GERMANYs S ECONOMIC POSITION AFTER FOUR MONTHS OF WARIn subsequent issues of this report it is hoped to he able;ive month by month a brief statistical picture of the effecthe pressure of the Allied blockade upon the enemy, and tocats its influence upon her war potential.      As a general&quot;P&amp;uction to later reports, this section attempts to give arol picture of the German eoonomy at the start of 1940.It is well known that Germany made elaborate preparationsoicrease her capacity to resist the pressure of the blockade,stocks of many, essential sea-borne raw materials were laidFactories were erected to produce synthetic oil and textileos.      Large stocks of cereals were stored and a very largeaal population was maintained..      At the same time her tradingboons with the Balkans and the Baltic States had been expandedAny cases on a non-commercial basis,  and the sale of astantial amount of exports before the war,  upon terms whichbred payments to be made after its outbreak, has done somethingrustain,  if not indeed to increase, her supplies of foreignlarge during the early months of the campaign.In a number of directions,  therefore., the present positionArnany re one of great strength,  and since six; an still continue toluce large quantities of new war stores,  (albeit at the costkastically curtailing domestic consumption,  of reducingots and of usang up accumulative stocks of raw materials,)&apos; war potential is probably still increasing and is likely to doAiring xbe first half of this year.      Nevertheless,  she has not- able to avoid giving hostages to the future,  for in herppts to decrease her general dependence upon sea-borne suppliesappears to have increased markedly the degree to which she-is upon supplies of particular commodities,  and the effect:rs to have been to give to her whole system a brittleness&apos;- did not exist in 1914-18.In each/

In each principal phase of Germany&apos;s war time economy thistrittleness can he detected.      Elaborate plans have been made for maintaining steel output,  and the several units of theHermann-Goering Works ought now to be moving stage by stage towardsfull production.      But there is evidence that these plans,  largelybased upon the use of local iron ore,  are proving unsatisfactory.If a large steel output is to be maintained, therefore, germany must rely to almost as great an extent as in the past upon importedores.      The handling of these,  and of the coke needed for the;/orks, places a great strain upon the already heavily burdenedtransport system.Germany has reduced, by the erection of plant for the production-tion of synthetic oil from local materials, her need for importerpetroleum products.      She has enough dope to raise her syntheticfuel to the standard required for aviation spirit.      But it now appears that lubricating oil, essential not only for the fighting and transport services but also for the whole complex industrialmachine, is in short supply.The same situation may develop with regard to the supply ofboth textile materials and of animal fats.      In order to decreaseher dependence upon imported cotton and wool,  the production of synthetic fibres has been &quot;ntensively studied and industrial equipment,  designed to use supplies of timber and pulp over which germany has control-,  has been erected.      But the replacement ofan adequate proportion of her lost imports of natural fibres willrequire a substantial further increase in productive capacity.The installation of the necessary plant will tax stocks of other materials eosential for her direct war effort,  and even if the required capacity can be built and equipped, under v/ar conditions,its full utilisation will then begin to make h.eavy demands upon-ier supplies, not only of pulp but also of specialised productssuch as sulphite pulp and carbon disulphide.Her general agricultural policy is also disclosing certainweaknesses./

weaknesses.      While it is probably wise to discount the storiesabout the destruction of large quantities of grain owing tounsuitable storage, difficulties are already being encountered in maintaining her large animal population upon which she reliesas a source for the supply of essential fats.      The feedingration for pigs has recently been reduced and pigs are now to beslaughtered when they reach 667-1 of maximum weight.     While this measure will enable Germany to maintain a larger animal population in existence for a longer period, of time than would otherwise bepossible with her existing supplies of feeding stuffs, it reduces the current output of fats, and any further economy in feedingstuffs would appear to necessitate the slaughtering of animalsand therefore cumulatively to decrease future supplies.In each principal section of her war economy there is aweak link, the snapping of one or all of which might have--consequences out of j.a3.1 proportion ,tQ:.the purely^statisticalccimportance., of the [particular commodity ccaicex&apos;.ned:-.  ...

--1 3-the adimlnjLstr-ati-v^.Qpmp^ in her&quot;whole-&quot;policy,have introduced a type of vulnerability different in kind fromthat which existed in 1 91    1 9&apos;i 8, when Germany had a tolerablyresilient economy fortified hy fairly substantial external assets,and possessing some degree of spontaneous vitality of its own.In the last War the^e were hidden reserves of materials in theform of household stores and furnishings;......-there were industrialreserves and large quantities-- of -materials which could be scrapped.Most of these sources have been systematically combed in recentyears so that the stocks officially accumulated constitute her(final reserve.The methods open to Germany to relieve hex&apos; supply positionjef ore she has exhausted her reserves appear to be three.    Firstlyto rely upon Russia and the Par Eastern route via Siberia.      Thetime required for developing this route must be considerable,and the difficulties of Rus so-German economic relations havealready been described in Section I (e) above,Secondly, by threat and intimidation to induce adjacentfreutrals to increase the quantities    of goods., including sea-some products, which they supply to Germany.      For this policy to be successful it would be necessary for the war trade agree-pents made,  or about to be made with us,  to be broken and for our contraband control to he severely weakened..Thirdly, she can occupy by force of arms one or more of theieutral territories adjacent to her.. The economic advantage ofmy such action appears to be strictly limited and would appearo depend upon whether she can sacrifice the supplies which shes now drawing from these territories during the period of mili- ry operations- and whether she can re -organise their productionEfficiently quickly to obtain in time the relief which she seeks.If she goes into Belgium and Holland, or Norway, Sweden andpnmark,  their capacity to supply her needs will steadily decreasepcause we shall be able  to cut    off from these countries theirpesent sear-borne supplies-      If Holland were to be occupied/

-*4-occupied, supplies from the Netherlands-East Indies, nowreaching Germany via Vladivostock, would possibly he cut off.Although measures of economic warfare, taken by the AlliedGovernments in the past four months, have limited and reduced the capacity of these five countries to supply Germany, she would lose such advantages as she at present obtains fromtrading with them, unless concurrently with invasion our blockade collapsed.    There would be some immediate gain byseizure of stocks, but the difficulties of building up aneconomic administration would probably reduce future supplies for a period that might well be long enough to be fatal to theGerman economy.To a lesser degree the same general principle is true of South East Europe.    In the last war the Austro-BAmgarianEmpire covered the great grain and fat producing area in the danube Valley and provided a tolerably stable administrativearea round the fringes of which expeditions were conductedagainst Roumania and Serbia and through to Bulgaria and Turkey,whence avenues of trade with the Middle East were opened,Under the conditions ruling in 1940, military operations in these areas must reduce the supplies which Germany is atpresent drawing from and through them.    And the immediate effect of conquest would be a disorganIsciiA on, both of productionand transport, such as might markedly reduce the yield ofthe harvests in the Autumn of 1940.    While the output of metalsand of oil might recover fairly rapidly within a few monthsof the completion of military operations, increased suppliesof food and feeding stuffs could probably not be obtained until after the harvest of 1941.    Germany would therefore have to run the risk of reducing her food and feeding stuff supplies during the winter of 1940-41 in the hope of getting a markedbenefit only in 1941-42.What is true of Germany&apos;s position with regard toadventures/
