MONTHLY REPORT (NO.5) BY THE AIR ministry on SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION.1.     The output of aircraft during the month of December,Q7Q  was 606 as compared with the planned output of 785-      Theeficiency on the planned programme is due partly to the smallunoer of aircraft delivered from the United States (only 6gainst a planned output of 63), partly by the incorporation of:ong material in one type of trainer aircraft which has nowgen rectified (the output of this type being reduced from afanned 5A to 17), and principally by the unusual prolongationi the Christmas holidays.      The planning had assumed that thehristmas holidays would involve the loss of only two days1utput, hut in fact the holiday period resulted in an actualess of some four to five days&apos; output, i.e. an additional lossf between 80 and 90 aircraft.     Fortunately the deliveries ofighters v/ere maintained, and there was no serious check ine output of the heavier bomber types.2.    Additional orders were placed during the month forjOOO aircraft v/hich will cost, together with engines,  turrets,mament and equipment, about  160 million.3.     The expansion of productive capacity in the aircraftdustry, by the extension of the works of existing aircraftnstructors and by recruiting new firms, has been continued,considerable progress is being made in establishing theitional productive capacity required to meet the war pro-rome.     Notable schemes which were approved during the monthDecember are as follows:-(i) It has been decided to establish a new factory atChristchurch under the management of Airspeed Ltd.for the production of Oxford (trainer) and QueenWasp (wireless controlled target) aircraft.      Thefactory, which will cost about  235,000 in addition./to

to the cost of land, will he situated near the main road, between Bournemouth and Southampton, adjoining an existing aerodrome and in an area whose resources oflabour have been comparatively little tapped hithertofor aircraft production.      It is estimated that thefactory will be in full production early in(ii) A new factory for the manufacture of Wellington(bomber) aircraft will be erected at Blackpool,adjacent to the Squire&apos;s Gate aerodrome, and managed by Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd.,     This factory, which will cost upwards of  1 million (excluding the cost ofland) v/ill, it is hoped, begin production towards theend of this year,(iii) Considerable extensions to the productive capacity ofHawker Aircraft Ltd. at Langley (Middlesex) and ofGloster Aircraft Ltd. at Gloucester have been approved.These extensions will be employed for the productionof a new type of fighter aircraft,  the Tornado,(iv) It has been decided to increase the capacity of Sir W.G.Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft Ltd. for the production,of a new type of heavy bomber (the Manchester) by theprovision of additional buildings at Baginton andWhitley, with the necessary additional plant andequipment.      The firm will also use for this purpose the works of So So Cars Ltd. which will be equipped bythe Department,     The scheme will cost in total some 3 million.(y) Another new firm which has been brought into the air-craft industry is Reid &amp; Sigrist Ltd., manufacturers of scientific instruments, whose works at Leicester,are^eing adapted at a cost of approximately  26,000 forthe production of fighter aircraft (Defiants and Beau-fighters) in association with Boultai Paul Aircraft Ltd./Engines.

4,   The following schemes of major importance wereoved during December for increasing the capacity for-engine production:-(i) Arrangements have been made to expand the capacityof the No. 1 engine Shadow Group, which is makingBristol poppet-valve engines, to the maximumattainable by minor building extensions and theprovision of balancing plant0    At a capital costof approximately  950,000, the output of the group will be raised by the end of 1941 to 150 enginesa week, plus the equivalent of 20 engines a week in the form of spares, as compared with a presentcapacity for the production of 120 engines a week(including spares),(ii) The capacity of Alvis Ltd, for the production of parts of Rolls-Royce engines and De Havillandairscrew components is being increased by theprovision of a new tool room at a cost of some 12,000, and by use of the eld tool room to enlargetheir machine shop.    A part of their motor-carworks, and their aero-engine test plant (with modifications costing about  15,000) will beemployed in the repair of a Rolls-Royce type ofengine and the manufacture of engine spares,fefc G. Turton Platts &amp; Co. of Sheffield are the solesuppliers of engine cylinder barrels for ArmstrongSiddeley and De Havilland engines, and they alsomanufacture cylinder ba. rels for Napier and Rolls-Royce engines.    In order to safeguard the supply of&quot;these cylinders, approval has been given for the/establishment

establishment of a new source of supply, in anotherarea, under the management of the firmf;\at a costof approximately  160,000, excluding the cost ofland, services and air raid precautionsc(iv) The Sheepbridge Stokes Centrifugal Castings company are undertaking the manufacture of 1,000 sleeves aweek for Bristol engines in a new works to be built at Sutton-in-Ashfield, at an estimated cost of 180,000.    The provision of further sleeves forBristol engines by another firm is being discussed,andwitr is.-hoped that a forging process now beingtested may be acceptable for a proportion ofadditional requirements^ine Accessories.5.   Careful watch is necessary to ensure tha^i all themplicated accessories required for aero-engines are producedthe rate necessary to balance engine production^    The11 owing are examples of the steps which were taken duringcember to provide the increased production of accessoriesouired for the engine programme:-(i) The output of Hobson carburettors required forBristol types of engine is being increased byutilising the y/hole of the floor space, includingthe basement, of the Shadow factory at Coventrymanaged by the Standard Companyc    Plant and machinery are being provided by the Air Ministryat a cost of  330,000,   A further increase ofproduction will be necessary to balance the engineprogramme, and additional projects for thatpurpose are under consideration,,

(ii)   Arrangements which have already &quot;been made for theproduction of De Havilland airscrews will suffice to meet requirements until the Spring of 1941,- outadditional production of certain components of theseairscrews will be necessary after that date.This is being provided for by ordering, for deliverytowards the end of 1940, some  230,000 worth of plant, which will be used in the Alvis, Austinand Standard motor car works,(iii)   Engine test plants for all the principal aero-enginemanufacturers are made by Messrs. Heenan &amp; Proudeof Worcester, and the large expansion of engine production which has been necessary has resultedin a demand for test plants which exceeds theirpresent capacity.    Arrangements have accordingly been made to provide them with additional floor space for the assembly of test plants at a cost,including services, of approximately  22,O0O0lament.6.    Great as has been the task of expanding the productionairframes and aero-engines in recent years, it has beenlied, if not surpassed, by the work of increasing parisu the production of the items of aircraft componentsr&apos; &amp;s gun turrets or undercarriages, and the multitude of-Heated instruments which are used in the equipment ofrn aircraft.    Examples of the more important measures ofnsion authorised in this connection during December 1939as follows :-New firms for the work are being recruited-    Twofirsgjwhich already have some experience ofinstrument manufacture and possess some of the/necessary

/Balloon Barrage.necessary equipment have already been selected forthis purpose and provided with balancing machineryat a cost of some  12,600.    Further productivecapacity may be necessary later.fii)   Messrs. Kelvin, Bottomley &amp; Baird are being providedby the Air Ministry with additional buildings andequipment, costing about  20;000, to increase their production of aircraft instruments,(iii)   Additional plant for retractable undercarriages isbeing provided by the Turner Manufacturing company and the Yorkshire Patent Steam Wagon Company at a cost of  19,000 and  15,500 respectively, and to equip with balancing plant costing  9,500 by theHydro Dividers Ltd,(IV)   Production by the British Thermostat Company of automatic thermostat controls (which protect aero-engines against excessive changes of temperature)is being increased from 720 to 1..600 a month,involving provision of additional buildings costing 10,000, in respect of which Capital Clause coveris being granted, and of additional plant,- to beprovided by the Air Ministry, at a cost of approxi-mately  28:000.jmt?.    During the month of December preliminary arrangementsmade to increase total productive armament capacity toiae for a peak output of 2,100 guns a month, an increase3 a month on the previous plans, by expansions all threeces of supply - The British Manufacture &amp; Research Company,tham, B.snA0 Guns Ltd., Birmingham and the Royal Ordnance0ry&apos; Enfield - at a capital cost pf approximately  1,340,000.

loonJL  a  &apos;8,    The decision to increase the initial equipment ofBalloon Barrage to 2,000 balloons together with allillary equipment and appropriate reserves was reported to cabinet last month.    During December 1939 action was takenimplement this decision by placing orders for the additionalies, winches, motor transport, hydrogen cylinders, and otherillary equipment required, and plans have been made forsnding the production of balloons and hydrogen.     Duringember the capacity of one proofing firm was increased, byequivalent of 84 balloons a month, by the provision ofrnV;-&apos;:. costing approximately  16,000, and it was decidedestablish a new factory, at a cost of approximately0,000, under the management of another existing producer,able of proofing fabric sufficient for 300 balloons a month,angements are being made for the provision of plan-*;, costingroximately  675,000 at the gas works   of five provincial&apos;ns to give an additional output of some SO million cubict of hydrogen a week,materials.9.     In the last report (W,P,(R)(39) 125, paragraph 22)was reported that further productive capacity would becessary for the production of light alloy extrusions.    Duringpember, arrangements were made, with the concurrence of thetoalian Authorities, for .?. 3,000 ton extrusion press beingufactured in this country for use in Australia, to bes?ted to the new factory being established at Rogerstone,1 Wales, under the management of Northern Aluminium Ltd,,bhis will go some way towards meeting the additionalpirements.    In addition seven presses costing  5,000 -each were ordered for the production of small extrusions?/which
