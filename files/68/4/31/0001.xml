CDJCOINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,cince the war &quot;began the question of the relationship of wages toces has been predominant in the industrial relations field.     The-   sections to euiy policj1- on tlie part of workpeople which would lead tostantly increasing wages as the cost of living rises, have now beenbrought forward more prominently than ever as the result of thePrime Minister1 s recent speech and the further discussion at the meetingf the National Joint Advisory Council held on 3rd January of the statementaade at the previous meeting &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     Itcannot be said that the response of workpeople has in general been favourable to the suggestions that they should refrain from seeking wage advances to offset rises in the cost of living.     There can be little doubt that oneof the reasons why workpeople are net prepared to forego the effort toMaintain their standard of living is a belief that in many industries employers are making exceptional profits as a result of the war.     It is also their new that the wages-prices spiral ought to be tackled at the prices end, byEaans of more effective Government control of prices and profits and not,airly at the expense, as they would allege, of the lowest paid members of thecommunity, at the wages end,2.    Demands for wage increases are still being made, in almost all casesthrough the medium of established negotiating machinery, and it can be saidhat since the outbreak of hostilities there has been no important industryn -which claims have not been put forward.     Most of these have now beenealt with and increases granted, although this does not of course meanat there may not be further claims in these industries in the future,table exceptions are the claims made by the railway employees andngmeering and shipbuilding workers, in which industries negotiations aretinuing,     in coal mining, where a temporary settlement providing for ancrease in wages was reached early in the war, discussions are proceedingler the auspices of the Mines Department on the question of the method ofture regulation of wages in the industry,The amount of the advance in wages, whether given as a flat-rate increasea percentage, work3 out in general at about 3/- to 4/- a week for adultes and proportionately for females and Juveniles.     There are howevers in which the increase secured is as high as 6/- per week, while ins it is as low as 2/- per week (e,g,, building and civil engineering trades^

On 8th January the Minister of Labour and National Service made anOrder &quot;bring into force as from 29th January the proposals submitted to himby the Road Haulage Central Wages Board under Part I of the Road HaulageWages Act, 1938.     This Order fixes the statutory remuneration payable tosome 200,000 road haulage workers employed by holders of A and B licences.The broad effeot of the Order is to give statutory effect for an initial period up to 5th May, 1940, to the rates which had been embodied in anagreement made a considerable time ago by means of the former VoluntaryNational Joint Conciliation Board for the Road Transport Industry (Goods) ,subject to certain adjustments.     There is therefore no substantial increasein the standard of wage rates, but there is the important difference thatthis will now be compulsorily enforced whereas previously it was largelyevaded, or at any rate, ignored.     After the initial period ending on 5th May changes will be made as regards overtime and certain other of the surrounding conditions, e.g., subsistence allowances and payment for nightwork, but the general level of remuneration will remain unchanged.     provision is also made for holidays with pay.     In conformity with the provisions ofthe Act a further Order has been made bringing Part II of the Act intooperation also on 29th January.     This Part of the Act affects some500,000 road haulage workers employed by C licence holders and providesmachinery for settling complaints as to the unfairness of the wages paid tosuch workers.EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT.5-   The first fortnight of the New Year generally witnesses a very heavyincrease in unemployment because of the end of the Christmas Season, adverseeather and the addition of school leavers.     The present period under review-11 probably be no exception.     The rough count of wholly unemployed takene(Aly shews that while there was a sharp fall in numbers before Christmas,&quot;ere ^as been an even sharper rise since.     As a result it is expected thate monthly count taken on Monday, 15th January, will show an increase in^Ployment.     The day on which the count was taken was a day of heavy frostdecreases that have taken place by reason of expansion of the wariistries will probably have no more than a mitigating effect.

- j^rm Unemployed.The result of the recent analysis of the long term unemployede. persons who have &quot;been unemployed for one year or more) is now:lable.     It will he remembered that public concern has been expressedit this group, the contention being made that special measures areessary to facilitate their absorption into the War effort.     There hast been time to study the full implications of the figures but the broadsuit is that since the outbreak of War there has been a decrease in thebers of men in this category from 240,000 to 136,000 i.e. of 40$.     Ass has been accompanied by a concurrent fall in the number of personsUnemployment Assistance there are good grounds for thinking that much the reduction is due to absorption of these men into such industriescoalmining and cotton, having regard to the subs bantial decreases thatve taken place in the Northern, North Western, Wales and Scotland&quot;visions.The following notes show the position in certain industriesmainly affected by seasonal influences:-agriculutre.The seasonal decline in employment in this industry continued and was-celerated during the last two weeks of December, 1939.     A considerablecrease is shown in the number ol farm workers, farm labourers andardeners wholly unemployed at 1st January, 1940.     In the case of skilledam hands the increase amounts to several hundreds, the total beingearly 5,000, while the number of farm labourers unemployed has risen byearly 2,200 to over 8,000.     The number of gardeners and gardeners1abourers registered has increased by 1,200 to a total of nearly 8,000.-e  decrease in employment has been general and has been particularlyeavy in the Eastern and North Midlands areas, following the cessation of*k on the harvesting of root crops,j-erical and Of floe Workers.&apos;   There has been an increase in unemployment amongst male clericalrkers in London and Southern Divisions, consequent on the quieternditions prevailing in many trades after the Christmas pressure period.Payment has not suffered appreciably amongst women, and the general level ofin other parts of the country was maintained.3.Ployment

t^+Al and Catering Trades.9,    The seasonal improvement which &quot;began with the approach of Christmashas continued up to the New Tear, though there has been an increase of nearly 1,000 in the number of wholly unemployed male workers in this industry.     The greatest variations have taken place in London and in theNorth Western and Scotland Divisions.     The position in the North WesternDivision continues to improve as a result of the influx of evacuees.Distributive Trades.10,   A considerable increase has occurred in the number of shop assistantswholly unemployed, due to discharges of workpeople after the Christmaspressure period.     Both men and women workers have been affected, thenumber of men unemployed having risen by nearly 2,000 to over 18,000 andof women by over 5,500 to more than 34,000.     The falling off in employmentin these trades has been fairly general in all parts of the country.Printing Trades.11.   A general decline in employment was noticeable so far as male operativesare concerned, particularly in the London district.     Little variation hastaken place in the number of women in this industry who were unemployed.Shortage of raw materials and consequent restriction of output of printedmatter continue to have an adverse effect on employment.Building Industry.12.   The total number of workers aged 18 to 64 (excluding casuals andtemporarily stopped) unemployed at 18th December was 127,700, representing a decrease of 13,498 as compared with 11th December, 1939, and 34,899 ascompared with December, 1938.     The number of skilled workers, excludingpainters, unemployed at 18th December was 38,469 - 2,195 less than atUth Deoember, but 2,114 more than in December, 1938.13&apos;  An increase in unemployment in the winter months is normal in thebuilding industry, and between the outbreak of war and 11th December a steady increase in the numbers unemployed both in the industry .   ...as a whole and in the skilled occupations was experienced.     It will beseen therefore that the unemployment totals for 18th December^present a reversal in.this movement.       The reduction in

employment has occurred a month earlier than has been the case inrcvious years, and has affected not only unskilled men who may have beentvm off into the Armed Forces, but men in the skilled occupations whoe reserved.     It is, however, too early to assess the significance ofthe movement which may be due to accidental causes and may prove to betemporary in character.4,   Unemployment among carpenters has remained almost constant at itsrevious low level but all other skilled occupations shared in thereduction in unemployment, including plasterers and plumbers, who have suffered the most severe increase in unemployment since the outbreak ofar.    The number of bricklayers unemployed fell by nearly 1,000 between1th December and 18th December.oal Mining.5,   Further analysis of the figures for 11th December revealed that,&quot;though there had been an increase of 9,626 in the total unemployed asompared with the month before, there had been a slight decrease in theumbers wholly unemployed, while the number of men temporarily stoppedad increased by over 11,000.     The increases were concentrated veryargely in three Divisions, the Northern (Northumberland and Durham)aving a total increase of 5,944, Wales of 1,972, and North Midlands -Derbyshire) of 1,151.Fishing Industry..6.   On the whole there has not been much change, though the position hasontinued to deteriorate in Grimsby.     Storaoway continues to have by51 &quot;the heaviest register of persons unemployed ih the fish curing andreserving trades, the total having been in the neighbourhood of 1,000inoe October.^Transport.*  The last two weeks have seen a decline in activity at many ports andiployment has tended to increase fairly substantially in LiverpoolLondon.     The total numbers proving unemployment in the second week ofj&amp;january exceeded those in the previous month by about 2.000.

THE CENTRAL REGISTER.18    The appended Note shows, for the period up to 15th January, thenumber of vacancies notified to the Central Register, the number ofsex-sons submitted and the number notified as engaged.19.   since the outbreak of War 6,577 vacancies have been notified, inrespect of which 6,891 persons have been submitted, and during thisoeriod 2,786 persons have been notified as engaged.20.   During the fortnight under review (1st to 15th January) orders for351 persons were received, and 863 persons were submitted to orderingDepartments.     This compares favourably with the previous fortnightwhen the corresponding figures   were 220 and 473 respectively.21.    The number of placings notified fortnightly to date have been asunder:-Fortnight ending30th September, 1939 4514th October, 1939 3831st October, 1939 26415th November, 1939 745   (follow up action by central Register by meansof personal visits toOrdering Departments).30th November, 1939 29215th December, 1939 733 (ditto)31st December, 1939 19615th January, 1940 40522.   The return for this fortnight is the best to date, excluding thetwo fortnights when special drives to clear outstanding submissions andpre-war &quot;earmarkings&quot; were made.     The difficulty in extracting information on placings from Departments is still considerable and a further series of visits is to be made shortly.23.   The number of effective cards of persons on the Central Register on15th January was 86,489.     It is shortly proposed to re-circularise personscertain sections of the Register in order to ascertain whether theiroffers of service are still valid.

TRAINING-.25823.Recruitment for the Government Training Centres has not yet recoveredthe falling off which began with the Christmas holiday. Intensivefforts to bring the Centres up to strength are now being made.JUVENILES.juvenile Unemployment.26,   At 11th December, 1939, there were 35,418 boys and 50,955 girlsregistered as unemployed - a total of 86,373 juveniles aged 14-17.     Asccnpared with the position at 13th November, the boys&apos; register had decreased by 5,042 (12^2 of the November figure) and the girls&apos; by 8,937 (15$ of the november figure).     All Divisions shared in this improvement, except that inthe N. Midlands Division the girls&apos; register had risen slightly.     In london the boys&apos; register had declined by as much as 18-g .Authorised Courses of Instruction.27,   At the end of December, 36 Junior Instruction Centres and 8 Classeswere in operation, chiefly in Wales and Scotland, including 5 Centres and3 Classes which had re-opened or opened during the month.RECRUITING.2S.   since the date of the last report 39,000 men have been posted to join the Army,    The total number of men who have been posted under theNational Service (Armed Forces) Act for service with the Army since theintroduction of compulsory military service has reached a total ofapproximately 213,000.     In addition a total of 10,858 men have been postedfor service with the Navy and 3,998 for Air Force service.     A posting ofapproximately 26,000 men to Field Army Units was also taking place on17th and 18th January.29&apos;  The most recent analysis of the results of the work of the Local Tribunals,which have been set up under the Act to deal with applications of men to beegistered as conscientious objectors, shows that 4,781 applications have beeneard,of which 692 or 14$ have been granted unconditionally and 831 or 18$ejected.     Of the remainder 2,151 men or 45$ of the total have beenegistered as conscientious objectors conditional on their undertaking certaincivil work specified by the Tribunals and 1,107 or 23$ of the total registereda service in the Forces but of a non-combatant nature only.     The Appellateibunal for England and Wales has considered a total of 208 appeals.8,

- 142 cases the appeals have been dismissed while in 66 cases the decisionf the Local Tribunals has   been varied.     The Scottish Division of the-pellate Tribunal has so far heard 28 appeals and in nine cases the decisionf the Local Tribunals has been varied.SCHEDULE OF RESERVED OCCUPATIONS.q.  To meet the demand for increased home production of crude oil furthereservation has been afforded to occupations in shale mining.1.   Iii accordance with the previous decision to give iron and steel productionhe fullest possible protection certain occupations in iron and steel rolling,rsviously omitted, have now been included in the Schedule.     It has also beencund necessary to grant increased reservation to certain skilled workersking refractory goods for iron and steel works.2,   Informal discussions have taken place with the wool and allied textile,rades regarding increased reservation for certain occupations in wool sorting,ombing, weaving and spinning.Provision for the Unemployed and for Relief of Distress.3.   The number of cases in which allowances were authorised or underonsideration was as follows: -	5th Jan. 1940.	12th Jan. 1940. ;UNH.EPLOYJvIENT ASSISTANCE (including supplementary allowances to claimants for unemployment insurance benefit).	407,000	406,000PREVENTION AND RELIEF OF DISTRESS.
