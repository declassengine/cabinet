Eighth Report on Coal position for Fortnight 15th to 51st December, 1959.Production and Employment.The total output of saleable coal for the fortnight ended25rd December amounted to 9,592,000 tons, or the same as in thepreceding fortnight. Compared with a year ago   this represents an advance of 174,000 tons.ITEM	1939		1938	Week ending 16th December	Week ending 23 rd -  December (provisional)	Week ending 24th DecemberEstimated Quantity of saleable coal raised	Tons 4,819,000	Tons 4,573,000	Tons 4,317,000Employment during the period 10th - 23rd December remainedfairly steady at around 760,000 wage-earners, which was, on theaverage, rather better than in the preceding fortnight, but some15,000 short of the corresponding total for 1938.   Working time at the pits was maintained, the time worked during the two weeks to 23rd December being 10.56 days against 10.58 in the precedingfortnight.

ITEMTotal quantity ofcoal shipped abroac(including the coa!equivalent of cokeand manufacturedfuel).1939		1938Week ending 16th December	Week ending 23rd December (provisional)	Week ending 24th DecemberTons 963,000	Tons 837,000	Tons 799,000Coastwise Shipments.The problem of ensuring a more satisfactory coastwise transportof coal and coke from the North East Coast to London and the South!3cast districts has been cpmplicated by the interruption of shipping3ue to mine laying and fog.   Although the situation was eased on both counts during the Christmas holidays, it has, on balance,Pprsened slightly.   Accordingly steps have been taken to explore the Possibilities of the alternative method of railing coal directIfrom Durham to London and the Southern Divisions.This move has been occasioned by the further decline in^stocks of coal held by the electricity and gas undertakings inliondon and the Southern Divisions.   The London Power Company hasExports.Although perraission for the export of coal continues to heted freely, the lack of shipping prevents full advantage beingn of foreign demand.    The total quantity of coal shippedspread (including the coal equivalent of coke and manufactured fuel)for the two weeks ended 23rd December amounted to 1,800,000 tons.T-iiSj though 191,000 tons more than for the corresponding periodof 1938, was 131,000 tons less than for the preceding fortnight,the primary cause of the decline was the drop in shipments fromthe North East Coast resulting from minelaying and other war-timeimpediments to sea transport.

-an to draw upon its reserve stocks,  and although the Gas Light;l coke Company retain a 5 to 6 weeks&apos;  supply of coal and theSouth Metropolitan Gas Company a 6-g- weeks&apos;  supply, both these undertakings have seen a substantial decline in stocks during thes?t fortnight.      Among the weaker spots with under k weeks&apos;supplies are the gas undertakings of the Plymouth Corporation,lunfcridge Wells, Bournemouth and the electricity undertakings ofleptford, Hackney and West Ham.      Public utilities with under&quot; weeks&apos;  supplies include the Pulham, Plymouth, Portsmouth andPlaclcwell Point Electricity Companies.      Still lower down the scaleare the Brighton Electricity works with under 2 weeks&apos;  supply andthe Woolwich Electricity works with under one weeks&apos;  supply.Abnormal arrangements are being made to keep these works goingut the position must remain precarious unless seaborne suppliesan be secured.Wages oThe Secretary for Mines on 28th December received a deputation&quot;rora the Mineworkers&apos;  Federation of Great Britain at which,  afterfiscussion,  the workmens&apos;  representatives asked two specific.questions,  the important one of which was -&quot;Will the Government, in view of the statements made bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer,   tell the employers thatthe Government is not responsible for keeping wages fromrising with the cost of living?&quot;The Secretary for Mines replied that the Chancellor of thexchequer was stating facts which any responsible body whether offmployers or workmen in any industry, must bear fully in mind.the was why the Chancellor made his statement to the whole countryn the Mouse of Commons and to the Joint Industrial Council.The Chancellor&apos;s statement did not alter the responsibilityghat rests on both employers and employed for using the machinerynat exists between them to seek agreement.The Secretary for Mines was very strongly pressed to elaboratePia statement.      Accordingly,  after emphasizing that thej^ancellor of the Exchequer had only been-dealing with facts whichjhe negotiating parties should bear in mind, he added by way of-vPlanation (as was agreed at the meeting at the Treasury on the

22nd December might be clone) that nothing had been said by thegovernment which affected the liberty of the parties to reach asettlement on what appeared to them mutually to be the merits ofthe case.Following this the miners held a Delegate Conference, at whichit was decided to seek powers from the District Associations toenable the Executive to negotiate further with the owners.A meeting of the Joint Standing Consultative Committee of owners and men has now been called for Thursday, hth January.RationingsIt became apparent that,  in view of the reduction in theconsumption of coal,  gas and electricity brought about by privateeconomy and other war conditions,  the statutory restriction of100,,. of last year&apos;s consumption had become ineffective and unnecessary;      and an announcement was made on the 21st december that the statutory restriction was suspended.      An Order is beingmade accordingly.This step will effect a substantial reduction in the expenseof local administration and will avoid the necessity (unless andatil effective rationing has to be introduced) of issuing millions of forms to householders.The machinery of rationing, however, which is now substantiallycomplete, will remain available to be put into operation at a mount&apos;s notice.      Provisions for the registration of coal merchants and consumers will staiid as at present,  though the Local FuelOverseer administration will be reduced to a care-and-maintenancetasis.     Local Authorities will be asked to make appropriate^rangements for  the earmarking of steff and accommodation,  thePreservation of records, and other matters necessary to ensure apid . resumption of the Local Fuel Overseer&apos;s functions in thejcase of necessity,

Fit-wood Position.The position with regard to supplies of timber for pits inSouth Wales is dangerous.        This district has always lived fromhriid to mouth in the matter of pit-wood supplies and at theoutbreak of war there were only seven to eight weeks&apos;  supply in thefree.       These have now dwindled to about five weeks&apos; hut the rate at which the stocks are &quot;being eaten into has been slowed, up, partly by shipments from France and Portugal,, partly by economy in the useof timber and partly by the arrival of home-grown supplies which&quot;oo hoodare now coming forward to South Wales at the rate of  GO/SOO- tons per week.As regards supplies from France it is to be admitted that theFrench have done a great deal to overcome the initial difficultieserased by the absence of labour and means of transport at theoutbreak of war.        In both these respects they have done much to remedy the situation and the failure recently to supply timber tothe extent promised has been mainly due to the non-availability ofshipping.        Actual receipts during December were about 50,000 asagainst the 80,000 tons promised.Supplies from Portugal have also not been up to expectationowing to various difficulties, in particular shortage of wagonsend ships, difficulties about price,  and the use of the timber asfuel in Portugal owing to shortage of coal.        Representatives ofthe South Wales Coal Owners are visiting Portugal shortly in an endeavour to improve the situation.With regard to the rest of the country, stocks amount to about five or six months&apos;  supply and are satisfactory for the time being.The normal sources of supply for the districts other than South&apos;&apos;?-les are the Baltic countries, and little if any timber can be^peeled from these countries next summer.        It follows that,after the spring of this year difficulties must be expected inr&apos;f-gf:rd to timber supplies unless it is possible to ship sufficienttimber from -North America or, alternatively, to provide steel to thee*tent that it can replace timber.      The position will also be^ieviated to some extent by the increase of home-grown supplies.

Progress of Production during first three months of War.The progress of coal production during the first three months0f war is illustrated by the quick recovery from the lew point ofk,065,000 tons in the first week of hostilities to a weekly totalof about k,700,000 tons which was maintained fairly steadily forthe remainder of the period.      The aggregate of 60,285,700 tons for the 13 weeks to 2nd December represents an increase of 2,227,000tons on the corresponding figure for 1338.     Most districtsparticipated in the rise, notably the Midland District, which showed an advance of 2,48h,U00 tons,  there being decreases onlyin Durham, Northumberland and Scotland.Employment during the first fortnight of war fell inaccordance with the off take of men into H.M. Forces and A.R.P.services which had begun to account for a large reduction in thenumber of wage earners on colliery books as early as 19th August.The downward trend was reversed between 16th September and1st November, when a weekly rise of about 1,500 per week in thepiurabers employed brought the total up to around 759*000,  (or about&apos;,000 less than at 19th August) at which level employmentisubsequently remained stable.The fact that the output of coal improved in such circumstanceslis due almost entirely to the better working of the mines.     Thefaverage time worked during the period was at 69*91  days rather moreIthan 6 days longer than for the like period last year.      It isloticeable in this respect that lack of trade was far lessInfluential as a cause of lost time than a year ago,   only 2.58 days-s against 9.82 days in 1938 being lost on this account.      In short,ill districts showed improved working time with the exception oflor thumb er land and Durham, which suffered most from shipping delays,the effect on particular pits being serious.      The gravity of theBroblem from the national standpoint is measured by the fall inlotal coastwise shipments in September by U23,000 tons and inIctober by 5U0,000 tons both as compared with a year ago.      This*s led to a serious shortage of supplies for gas and electricertakings in &quot;the Thames and South Coast areas.
