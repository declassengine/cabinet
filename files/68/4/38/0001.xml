The review of local authorities&apos; establishments of A.R.P. personnels continuing, and in the meantime special consideration is being given to.e question of mutual support and reinforcements in certain vulnerable areas.inter-Regional mutual support exercise on a large scale was held in thedway area on Sunday, January 21sto    It has been decided to create undere Kent County Council a special reserve to be used for reinforcing thervices in this area, and arrangements are now in hand for enrolling andganising this force.     At the same time the instructions on training inabined exercises have been issued, and the special officer appointed toRegion for training purposes has completed a course at Headquarters andin process of passing on the instructions under the training plan toficers of the looal authoritieso3*      Regional Commissioners have been asked to undertake a review ofraises requisitioned or taken by agreement by local authorities for A.R.P.rvices, with a view to effecting economies and releasing premises requiredor other purposes whenever practicable.jhtltig Restrictions.&apos;      A new Lighting (Restrictions) Order has been made, embodying allmodifications instituted since last year, such as the relaxationsiowed for street, vehicle and shop lighting, and containing certain newquirements, including the compulsory use of the special type of headlamp  &apos;k on privately owned vehicles.5.The Inter-Departmental Committee on Lighting in Industrialtablishments is continuing its work and has been paying special attentionlighting in shipyards.   Two meetings have been held with the&quot;Pbuilding Employers&apos; Federation, at which the procedure has been settled? general examination of the position in yards, where in many cases eitherlighting restrictions were being evaded or the special relaxations

allowed were not being used to their full capacity. It is hoped inoo-operation with the Industry to introduce a unifoxm and efficientsystem of lighting in shipyards.ttnerqenoy Fire Brigade Measures,6.      Deliveries of pumping units continue at an average rate ofover 450 pumps per week.   Difficulty is still being experienced in theDroduction of heavy and extra heavy units owing to shortage of some ofthe component parts.7.      Two important regional exercises Were held in the London FireRegion during the period under review, both involving arrangements withthe authorities of neighbouring Regions.   Ah exercise was carried out onthe 19th January to rehearse the situation which might be cause by the occurrence of fires in shipping anchored off Gravesend,     Eight fireboats from the London Region took part, in addition to two from theThurrock Brigade in No. 4 Region.    Fifty-two fire appliances from 17brigades in the London Region also took part in the regional civil defence exercise at Chatham on the 21st January.Casualty, Services.8.      On January 21st, the number of vacant beds in England andWales had dropped to approximately 130,000 shewing a reduction of 15,000beds during the previous fortnight.     The number of Servioe sickoccupying casualty beds had risen to 11,000, shewing an increase of 5,000*Part of this increase is due to the arrival from France of regular convoysof military sick, who are being taken into base hospitals round London.In addition 10,000 &quot;casualty&quot; beds have been taken up by civilian sickduring the fortnight.     This is due to the normal seasonal increase ofillness, aggravated by the exceptionally severe weather.9*      In Scotland the number of available beds has similarly dropped by 650 to 11,100 over the fortnight, after taking into account 400additional beds in new accommodation0     Fifteen private houses providing850 beds have now been brought into commission as convalescentaccommodation.10.      The loss in &quot;casualty&quot; beds is,   however, steadily being made&quot;P by the progress with the huts, many of which are now fit for occupation, but few of which are yet shewn as &quot;available&quot; casualty beds,as the arrangements for final equipment and for staffing have still inmost oases to be completed..   It has been estimated that huts   capableof aoconmodating 17,000 beds will be completed by the end of the month,wlile huts capable of accommodating a further 10,000 beds will be covered in and capable of use in an acute emergency.   Owing to the weather this programme may be a little delayed;   it is reported thatthere is no difficulty about labour and that the supply of building materials (other than timber) is in general improving.

Defence Report No. 8, para. 19.Civil11.      In Scotland accommodation for approximately 2,500 &quot;beds in huttedhospitals is   expected to be available within the next three weeks.12.      The offer to medical specialists and consultants of transfer toDart-time service at a salary of  500 has how been accepted by 488practitioners (about 65 per cent of those approached).     A similar offer on a deferred basis is now being made to about 100 practitioners of similar status who have enrolled&apos; in the Emergency Medical Service, but have1not yet been called up&apos; for duty.   Of the 55 replies to the offer1 s6 farreceived 48 have accepted.   The saving to the Exchequer in these bases isnot immediate but would be material if it became necessary to call upon these officers for service.13*      Good progress continues to be made by local authorities inreplacing the trade vans hired for ambulance purposes at the outset of warby second-hand cars bought outright and properly adapted.   This has notonly produced better ambulances but is resulting in a substantial reductionin the oost of the ambulance service.*14.      Reference has been made in a previous Report   to the release ofGreen Line coaches converted into ambulances at the outbreak of war forinter-hospital transport in London.     Steps are now being, taken to   release a number of coaches which were similarly taken over in &quot;the Provinces.Evacuation.15.      The returns so far received from local authorities in Englandand Wales, which cover about three-quarters of the total, shew that up to january 8th about 77 per cent, of the mothers and young children and 46 percent, of the School children who were evacuated   had returned to theevaouation areasi   The percentage of London children who have returned is35 per cBhbj but fbr some of the northern towns the proportion is considerably higher.16.      In Scotland the returns shew that 78 per cent of the numberoriginally evaouated have returned.   The figure for adults is86 per cent.,for pre-school children 88. per cent, and for school children 73 per cent.number of school children remaining in reception areas representsapproximately 11 per cent, of the total normally living in sending areas.17* Consideration has been given to the question what steps oan betaken to promote further evacuation of school children and to retain inthe reception areas those children who have been evacuated and who still remain there. The conclusion has been reached that it would be neitherPracticable nor desirable to plan a further general evacuation of schoolildren at a fixed calendar date, but that it is essential that plans0     be Prepared which could be put into operation at short notice and in

-vn orderly manner in the event of air raids developing.     Proposals haven p^pared in outline for the formulation of such plans and Ministers areconsulting the Associations of Local Authorities and other bodies concerned as to their detailed working outa18*      Provision has been made in special units in the emergency servicehospitals for the treatment of evacuated children in the London receptionareasi    Medical men and nurses specially trained in the hospital care ofchildren will be in charge of these unitso   It is hoped to make similar arrangements in the Provinces.Schools.19.      The Board of Education have informed Local Education authorities that, by arrangement with the Ministry of Health and the National CampsCorporation, they are now in a position to place a number of the Corporation^camps at the disposal of Local Education Authorities for use as Secondary,Senior or Selective Central Schools for evacuated children for the duration of the war.Public Order.20.      Public order and morale continue to be excellent.   Communistactivity during the period has nearly everywhere taken the form of the circulation of leaflets opposing the supply of war materials to Finland and urging the workers to stop what is represented as an attack on the U.S.S.R.Railways.21.      Fog and the severe weather conditions experienced recently,combined with a heavy incidence of sickness among drivers and firemen, has caused delays in goods and passenger traffic and has seriously interferred&apos;th coal traffic generally and in particular with the supply of coal toublic utility undertakings in London and the South of England.
