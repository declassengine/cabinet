MINISTRY OF FOODREPORT ON FOOD SUPPLIES1.     HEMSRAL SUMMARY.The statistical position of foodstuffs, projected to the endof February, is summarised in the Appendix and a descriptive account isgiven in the body of this report.     During the past month there has beena considerable increase in the bulk stocks of wheat, but stocks of maizecontinue to be negligible, and home-grown barley is being used up more rapidly than usual owing to the low level of imports.     The price of the4-lb. loaf is expected to rise from 8-gd. to 9d. as soon as the increasein the price of flour is sanctioned.Stocks of meat, bacon and butter have been increased by restricting consumption.     During the past month it has been possible to release additional supplies for consumption during the Christmas season,.The anticipated changes in the retail prices of certain foodstuffs including bread, would, if permitted, entail a small rise in theofficial cost of living index.2.     WHEAT.During the four months from September to December 1939, importsof wheat (including flour in terms of wheat) were about 20 per cent,below normal.     Imports during the first three months of 1940 are now estimated at about 50 per cent, above normal.Last month1s report to the War Cabinet stated that total consumption of wheat from mid-October to mid-November was 12 per cent,above normal, but if the seasonal factor or seed used were eliminated,total consumption during that period was at a normal level.     From mid-November to mid-December total consumption was about 8 per cent, abovenormal, but the increase was apparently due to abnormal feeding of wheat to livestock.     Human consumption of wheat, assuming that no change hasoccurred in stocks of flour held by bakers and retailers, has remainedalmost constant since the end of September at the normal rate of about115,000 tons per week.     That there has been no appreciable increase in

the demand for flour for consumption is no doubt due to the fact thatample supplies of other foodstuffs have still been available.Bulk stocks (including stocks in mills and public warehouses)which prior to the end of November had &quot;been sufficient for about 7 weeks&quot;normal human consumption, were at the end of December equivalent to about  weeks&apos; normal human consumption.     Assuming (i) that human consumptioncontinues at the normal rate in the next three months, and (ii) thatone-half of the home crop utilised is consumed by animals, bulk stocks at the end of February and the end of March, on the basis of the latest estimates of arrivals, will be equivalent respectively to 14.7 and16 weeks&apos; supply at the normal rate of human consumption.     It should benoted that these figures and the corresponding figures of total stocks,contained in the Appendix, include the millers&apos; reserve of 3 weeks&apos;supply of wheat and 1-g- weeks&apos; output of flour to ensure continuity of operation.The separate memorandum (W.P. (G-) (39) 132) submitted to theWar Cabinet by the Home Policy Committee on the 6th December pointed tothe desirability of obtaining by the end of March, 13 weeks&apos; supply ofwheat (excluding flour) in mills and public warehouses.     On this basis the stocks at the end of December were equivalent to 7.1 weeks&apos; supplywhile the estimated stocks at the end of February and March, 1940, will represent 12.7 weeks&apos; and 14 weeks&apos; supply.     These figures assume thatthe deficiency of actual arrivals of wheat in December, 1939 (about100,000 tons) as compared with the estimated arrivals shown in theAppendix to the Memorandum of the Sub-Committee of Officials (P.P. (M)(39) 5) is made up in the period January to March.3.     MAIZE.Arrivals of maize (including maize products) during September-December 1939, were about 50 per cent, below normal.     Imports during january - February are estimated at only 50 per cent, of normal for thesetwo months.The apparent average consumption of maize during the eight weeks ending 16th December was at the rate of 37,000 tons a week ascompared with an average of 67,000 tons during the three years 1935 to19S7.

the demand for flour for consumption is no doubt due to the fact thatample supplies of other foodstuffs have still &quot;been available.Bulk stocks (including stocks in mills and public warehouses)which prior to the end of November had &quot;been sufficient for about 7 weeks1normal human consumption, were at the end of December equivalent to about  weeks&apos; normal human consumption.     Assuming (i) that human consumptioncontinues at the normal rate in the next three months, and (ii) thatone-half of the home crop utilised is consumed by animals, bulk stocks at the end of February and the end of March, on the basis of the latest estimates of arrivals, will be equivalent respectively to 14.7 and16 weeks&apos; supply at the normal rate of human consumption.     It should benoted that these figures and the corresponding figures of total stocks,contained in the Appendix, include the millers&apos; reserve of 3 weeks1supply of wheat and 1-g- weeks&apos; output of flour to ensure continuity of operation.The separate memorandum (W.P. (G-) (39) 132) submitted to theWar Cabinet by the Home Policy Committee on the 6th December pointed tothe desirability of obtaining by the end of March, 13 weeks&apos; supply ofwheat (excluding flour) in mills and public warehouses.     On this basis the stocks at the end of December were equivalent to 7.1 weeks&apos; supplywhile the estimated stocks at the end of February and March, 1940, will represent 12.7 weeks&apos; and 14 weeks&apos; supply.     These figures assume thatthe deficiency of actual arrivals of wheat in December, 1939 (about100,000 tons) as compared with the estimated arrivals shown in theAppendix to the Memorandum of the Sub-Committee of Officials (F.P. (M)(39) 5) is made up in the period January to March.3.    MAIZE.Arrivals of maize (including maize products) during September-December 1939, were about 50 per cent, below normal.     Imports during january - February are estimated at only 50 per cent, of normal for thesebvo months.The apparent average consumption of maize during the eight weeks ending 16th December was at the rate of 37,000 tons a week ascompared with an average of 67,000 tons during the three years 1935 to1957.

Stocks of maize fell from 3 weeks&apos; normal consumption onbra September to a negligible quantity in mid-November and end-Decemberstocks are estimated at only -g- week&apos;s consumption.     -If the presentestimate of January - February arrivals is not exceeded there will be only about 40,000 tons per week available for consumption, leaving about one week&apos;s supply on hand at the end of February.BARLEY.Imports of barley during September - December 1959, werelabout 50 per cent, of normal for these four months.     Arrivals duringIjanuary - February are estimated at 80,000 tons (about 70 per cent, of normal.)Allowing for a weekly rate of consumption of 40,000 tons during january and February, total stocks at the end of February are estimatedat 8 weeks&apos; consumption at the same rate.5.    ANIMAL FEEDING STUFFS.Restrictions on the loading of cereals other than wheat have notqfyet fully been removed and the February/March position is still uncertain,but it is now fairly safe to assume that at least 40 per cent, of normalI^supplies of cereal feeding stuffs will be available in January, february and March.     The present monthly allocation of tonnage for wheat and other:cereals of 880,000 tons, allows for 220,000 tons of feeding stuffs and providing that loadings in January are up to this level it will be possiblefto raise releases to wholesalers to 50 per centc of normal in January,February, and March.Proposals have been made to the Ministry of Shipping for aseparate programme for feeding stuffs for January to March loadings,abased on the revised approved purchase programme.Wheat offals are &quot;being produced by British flour mills at the formal rate, but as imported offals are in short supply, the total supplypi1 offals is about 80 per cent, of normal,i     PUSEEDS &amp; NUTS &amp; VEGETABLE &amp; MARINE OILS.Recent imports of oilseeds and nuts have been barely sufficientto meet requirements and, at the present rate of consumption, stocks athe end of December represented only 4 weeks&apos;  supply.     Stocks of vegetable1ls, which are dependent for their replenishment on imports of seeds,gpounted to only 2-g- weeks&apos; supply at the end of December.     A memorandumK&amp;s CQnsidered by the Official Committee on Food Policy,  on the 8thjl january, ^n ^ich the import requirements of oilseeds and oils were set

out for the first half of 1940.     It was agreed that the programme shouldbe adopted re the basis for importation during the three monthsJanuary, February and March, 1940*     Ample supplies of oilseeds areavailable in the producing countries.To meet the needs of the trades utilising vegetable oil it isnecessary to import 40,000 tons of oilseeds (which, after crushing,produce approximately one-third oil and two-thirds oilseed cake) and5,000 tons of palm oil.     Consumption of edible oils is at presentabove normal owing to the increased demand for margarine and imitationlard to meet the shortage of butter and animal lard.     Margarineproduction must be maintained at 6,000 tons a week to provide a supplyof 4-oz. per head of the population after trade requirements have been met and a weekly production of 4,500 tons of imitation lard is requiredto ensure a supply of nearly S-oz.    per head.     For these purposes alonemore than 20,000 tons of oilseeds will be required weekly, in addition to nearly 1,000 tons of edible palm oil and 3,000 tons of whale oil.     Afurther 20,000 tons of oilseeds are required to provide oil for biscuitmanufacturers, confectioners, fish fryers, and soap, glycerine and paintmanufacturers.Stocks of whale oil at the end of December were equivalentto 56 weeks&apos; supply at the present rate of consumption of 4,000 tons aweek for all purposes.     Arrivals of the new season&apos;s supply are expectedto commence in March and the position can be regarded as satisfactory.7.     SUGAR.Gross imports of raw sugiar averaged 23,000 tons per week duringthe eight-week period ending 16th December as compared with 41,000 tons,the 1935/37 weekly average.     Imports during the period 17th December tothe end of February are estimated at an average weekly rate of 26,000 tons.Apparent total consumption (including exports which are now much below normal) of refined sugar during the eight weeks ending 16th Decemberis estimated at 47,500 tons per week, as compared with 46,200 tons, the1935/37 weekly average.     Allowing for the reduced rate of exports, theincrease in domestic consumption of sugar during the eight-week period was about 17 per cent, above normal.

Although the rationing of householders at the rate of f lb, per header week begins on 8th January, total consumption (including exports) in Januaryis estimated at 202,000 tons (45,600 tons per week).     The small reduction in*hic figure as compared with the average for the eight weeks ending 16th December;s explained as follows: (i) rationing of manufacturers does not start until 1st February (ii) an allowance has been made for the export of 10,000 tons abovenormal to Eire to offset their crop failure and (iii) provision has been made for supplies to manufacturers for the marmalade season.Total stocks of refined sugar at the end of December are estimated at482,COO tons, or 10.4 weeks&apos; normal (1935/37) consumption.     Total stocks at theend of February are estimated at 316,000 tons, or 9.1 weeks&apos; supply at the rationrate of 35,000 tons per week, allowing for exports.     The bulk stock at the endcf February is estimated at only 236,000 tons, or only 6.8 weeks&apos;  supply at the ration rate of consumption.     The bulk stock is expected to increase to 365,000tens (10.4 weeks&apos; supply at the present ration rate) by the end of May and thendecline by the end of July to 260,000 tons (7.4 weeks&apos; supply at the presentation).The estimated minimum bulk stock of raw sugar required to ensurecontinuity of distribution is 400,000 tons (in terms of refined sugar 10.3 weeks&apos;supply at the ration rate) provided there is an unbroken flow of arrivals at therate of 150,000 tons per month.     The optimum bulk stock of raw sugar required toensure continuity of distribution, and to maintain a reserve to guard againstdelays and other unforeseeable contingencies, is estimated at 650,000 tons (interms of refined, 16.7 weeks&apos; supply at the ration rate).     In view of the shortageof shipping space it is considered unlikely that a reserve stock of this size cane reached..    MEAT.Imports of meat in recent weeks have been well above normal, but arexpected to be about 25 per cent, below normal in January and February.Consumption of meat, including supplies for the services from^-November to end-December was approximately normal.     Consumption during Januaryd February is forecast at 32,000 tons per week, or about 25 per cent, belowrail.Stocks of frozen meat have nearly doubled since mid-November and areected to be maintained...during the next few months at a constant level equal to0Ut 8 weeks&apos; supply of imported meat.5.

Apparent consumption during the four weeks ending 16th December was about: cent, of normal as compared with 54 per cent, during the four previous weeks.Total stocks increased from 28,000 tons in mid-November to 39,000 tonse end of December.     Total stocks at the end of February are estimated attons or 10 weeks&apos; supply at the ration rate of 6,700 tons per week;   bulkks at the end of February are estimated at 9 weeks&apos; supply at the ration rate,minimum stock required to ensure continuity of distribution is 20,000 tons.CHEESE.Stocks of cheese, although representing only about 4 weeks&apos; supply at end of December are not considered dangerously low since anticipated importsexpected to meet the demands of consumers.     Some decrease in domesticction is probable owing to the diversion of milk from cheese-making toensing in order to meet the requirements of the Services, but this is notted to have a serious effect on total supplies.POTATOES.Stocks of potatoes, the bulk of which are held on farms, are adequate to normal consumption until the end of the season.     Apart from small shipmentsNorthern Ireland and Eire there is no reason to expect calls on shipping space8 the next few months.Imports of bacon and ham during September - December 1939, were only9 per cent, below normal;   imports during January - February 1940, areited at about 9 per cent, below normal,,Consumption during the four weeks ending 16th December was aboutcent. of normal as compared with about 68 per cent, during the five weeksi8th November.     Restriction of supplies to dealers has been necessary inr to build up stocks.Total stocks are estimated to have increased from 24,000 tons in mid-ber to 29,000 tons at the end of December,,     Total stocks at the end ofry are estimated at 39,000 tons or 6 weeks&apos; supply at the ration rate oftons per week.     The minimum stock required to ensure continuity ofribution is put at 32,000 tons.BUTTER.Imports during September - December 1939 were 27 per cent, below normal;rts during January - February 1940 are estimated at about 8 per cent, above

-*NN2D MEAT.Stocks of canned beef are being mainly held for the Services .and, in25 CCO tons), as a reserve for civilian consumption in the event of severeids.    Recent imports have been adequate to meet Service requirements0     Itnoosed, subject to agreement as to price, to contract for the whole of the.,t cf the South American factories during the next canning season which opensarch,CANNgD SALMON.Imports of canned salmon in recent weeks have been more than sufficientpet immediate requirements and stocks at the end of December representedeeks1 supply.     Existing stocks, together with the quantities afloat, shoulde continuity in supply throughout 1940oTEA,During the past few weeks consumption of tea (including exports) hasapproximately 8 per cent, above normal and has exceeded arrivals.     Bulk stocksea at the end of December represented 16 weeks&apos; supply.     Provided that noous delay occurs in the shipment of supplies, for which contracts have already made, the position throughout 1940 should be satisfactory.SHIPPING. AND COLD STORAGSoAlthough immediate anxiety as to the wheat position has been allayed,e is still an urgent need for tonnage for cereals and sugar already purchasedthe more distant Empire sources of supply.     In South Africa there is a recorde crop with an exportable surplus estimated at 1,400,000 tons, but at presente is no tonnage available for lifting 80,000 tons already purchased.     Purchasestherefore been suspended.     There is also, in Natal, an unfreighted balance2,000 tons of sugar.In the United Kingdom the chartering of neutral tonnage has been limitedessels loading in Prance, Bulgaria, Roumania and Morocco.     Some neutralels have been chartered to carry wheat to Prance in replacement of Frenchshipped to the United Kingdom.     Greek owners have been unwilling to chartere United Kingdom, but, for Eire, one vessel has been chartered from Argentinaour from North America,A careful examination of the amount of refrigerated tonnage available,red with estimated requirements and taking account of the present length ofVQyages, discloses a prospective shortage on the South American route.     SomeCe oay also have to be made for further losses due to enemy action.

/China route also, there is insufficient space to lift the cargo available the end of June, The question whether the present embargo on the building,-Yiaerated ships should be lifted is Under consideration by the Ministry ofrjnid Storage:     Since November last the Ministry&apos;s demand for cold storage spaceir.c: eased-Sanction has been given by the Treasury for the providing of 5,000,000: .-cet of new cold storage space and some progress has been made with theliminary work in connection with the erection of the stores in conjunction withOffice of Worksoprices.As reported last month certain increases in retail food prices are nowliable if large losses are not to be incurred on the Ministry of Pood&apos;sding account.     At the end of this section a table shows the estimated effectively higher prices upon the cost of living index,.Bread and Flour0   As mentioned in last month&apos;s report the prices atch flour is at present sold are insufficient to cover the increase in costs ofights; insurance and overseas prices,,     The increase in overseas prices isly due to the diversion of purchases to Canada, which is the dearest thoughthe nearest source of supply.An increase in the price of flour from the present price of 25s, 6d. to. per sack, is under consideration.     The effect would be to raise the price ofd immediately from 8-g-d. to 9d. per 4-lb  loaf.     This increase may not be&quot;icient for more than a short period if the Ministry is to recover itsonditure.     In order to balance the Ministry&apos;s accounts over the next threetis, the price of flour would, it is estimated, have to rise to 40s, per sackluding quota payments) and bread to 9g-d.Chee3e0     Present prices of imported cheese are insufficient to coverand a loss of about  10,000 a week is being incurred mainly on this account,,rise in retail prices necessary to terminate this loss is about Id, per lb,Eggs,     Control of egg prices has recently been removed since there wason to believe that the existence of a Maximum Prices Order was delaying theal Tall of price which is now due     It is :expected that retail prices willinward ]-,y abou-t 6d. per dozen during the next few months.Margarine.     It will probably be necessary at an early date to raise the&quot;s at which the raw materials are sold by the Ministry to manufacturers.     the 8.

t-l price scale of 5d. to 8d, vri.ll not necessarily change, since the publicra shows a tendency towards the higher priced varieties.Dried Pruits.     A new Order governing the prices of dried fruits will-scribe maximum margins, and will permit changes in the Ministry&apos;s sellings to be made as circumstances warrant. For the intitial period, certainice reductions are contemplated, e.g. on Sultanas and Currants, but in otheres some increase may be necessary.Meat (Home-produced).     The Ministry&apos;s scheme for the control ofrestock will shortly be in operation and the schedules of retail prices areut to be issued.     Home-killed beef is placed in two categories, first andend quality, and the following specimen maximum prices are given, together withe prices of the corresponding cuts on December 1st, 1939;-Schedule Priceef:-ribsthin flanktton: -legsbreast1st Qualitys.  d.1   4101   682nd Qualitys.  d,1   161   04Price atDecember 1st, 1939.s. aU1   38i1   418*On the average, these prices may show little if any increase over thecember prices and may, therefore, leave the cost of living index unaffected,e Sehcdule prices are not expected to cover the present cost to the Ministry ofchasing home-produced cattle and would require to be raised to avoid the lossthe Meat and Livestock FundsMeat (imported):     Maximum prices of imported beef, as given in the newhedule,show some increases;-PercentageSchedule Price        Price at December        change overs.    do1st 1939.s.    d.December 1st, 1939,ribsthin flanktton. -breast1604lOi5^og-114i* 24* 9* 9- 11These prices would still require to be raised to avoid loss to the at      Livestock Fund,

REPORT ON FOOD PRODUCTION(By the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesconjunction with the Secretary of State for Scotland)January 2nd, 1940.Ploughing up CampaignThe total acreage to be ploughed up under the current ploughingcampaign in the United Kingdom is approximately 2 million acres,iications for ploughing up grant now total approximately l4: millionbut this latter figure includes a certain acreage not forming part the war-time task, as it consisted of land already ploughed up beforetember 3rd.In England and Wales the acreage selected for ploughing up by thety Committees (in respect of more than half of which ploughing up orderse now been served on farmers) is nearly lr millions out of a total ofmillion acres.     The corresponding figure for Scotland is not yetlable but applications for grant have been made in respect of 206,000es.    Both in England and Scotland a number of counties have exceededir quotas.As a result of the reduction to one acre of the minimum acreagelifying for the ploughing up grant, a larger acreage will probably beered by smallholders and crofters.     On the other hand, the Defenceartments have taken more agricultural land than was foreseen and this has ine counties appreciably accentuated the difficulty of increasing the arableeage.Crop Acreage bOnly very rough indications can be given of the likely increasesacreage of particular crops.The wheat acreage is expected to increase by some 300,000 acresPared with last year:   this is better than was expected in view officult sowing conditions during the autumn.It may prove difficult to secure an expansion of the sugar-beeteage.

Prospects for an expansion of the potato acreage are promising,especially in view of recent announcements regarding the stabilisation0f prices during the current season and the safeguarding of producerscgainst the effects of a surplus next season.Most of the fodder crops (except temporary grass) should increasein acreage, and the greatest percentage increases may be in kale, beansand rye.     A guaranteed price for rye on the lines of the guaranteed price for oats has been announced.     But the acreages of these three crops arecomparatively small, and their combined increase may not exceed that whichis expected for oats alone.     The greatest absolute increases are expectedfor oats, wheat and barley.It is hoped, if suitable price arrangements can be made, tosecure an increase of about 40,000 acres of land under flax in the UnitedKingdom, of which 12,000 acres would be in Great Britain.     (flax is now an approved crop for ploughing up grant where the land is suitable and a contract has been arranged with the processors).Crop output is not likely to increase in proportion to cropacreage.     Reports received in the Ministry suggest that there is muchlikelihood of low yields on newly ploughed up land   and that farmers regard the risk of poor crops on such land as one of their principal disabilities.Man PowerNo further agricultural workers are to be called up until themiddle of February, and postponement is being allowed in individual cases for six months (or longer if necessary) where the withdrawal of the men would seriously interfere with food production   and their replacement is   forthe present impracticable.     The War Office have also agreed to consider sympathetically the release of &quot;key&quot; men already called up.      In GreatBritain 728 men who were members of Territorial or Reserve Forces havealready been released, 210 of them for an indefinite period.Forty-three Agricultural Wages Committees in England and WalesViave increased wage rates or decided to do so   and when all the decisionsbecome operative the average minimum statutory wage in England and Walesincreased from 34/9d. on September 1st to 37/2d.     Farmers&apos; and

leers&apos; representatives are still in disagreement over the proposals madethe latter for vesting the pov7er of fixing minimum rates in a Centraligr: cultural Wages Board.     A compromise solution is being considered,unilar disagreement exists in Scotland.      Increases of minimum rates have. a result been retarded in Scotland but new rates are now in the coursef determination by Wages Committees.Owing to the hitherto small demand for their services the &quot;live&quot;strength of the Women1 s Land Army has fallen far below its nominal totalof 25,000.     Training of women is still proceeding, but on a restrictedscale.     Nevertheless, the W.L.A. organisation is preparing to meet a bigexpansion of demand in a few months&apos; time, though if farmers want therorkers in a hurry they will often have to train them on the farms.      Thenumber of \7. L.A. workers placed in employment to date in Great Britain is approximately 3,000.Machinery and Implements.The initial allocations to County Committees of tractors and implements out of the Government reserve proved adequate for the purposeof the autumn ploughing season.     In the spring there will be a greaterscope for the use of Government equipment, and arrangements are being madefor the supply to Committees of the additional tractors and implementsthat will be required.     Steps are also being taken to provide for theprobable requirements of machinery to deal with the next harvest.Seeds and FerbilisersIn order to secure the necessary supplies of cereal seed in face of the increased demand and reduced supply (owing to shortage ofcereals for feeding) the following steps have been taken or are underconsideration:    farmers have been warned to rely to a greater extent than usual on their own supplies of seed;    export of seed to Eire will be prohibited except under licence;    the possibility is being explored of purchasing seed oats from Scandinavia;    and it may be necessary to requisition seed barley now in the hands of maltsters and brewers.As regards fertilisers, there is a difficulty of securingsufficient shipping space for imports of phosphate rock.     From Scotland

shortage of imported pyrites (used in the manufacture of superphosphate ^^d sulphate of ammonia) is also reported.     Price increases have been authorised for phosphatic and compound fertilisers.Feeding StuffsThe feeding stuffs position has become worse during december and is now very serious in certain parts of the country and among pigand poultry keepers.     Amongst other reasons, the December allocation todistributors of imported grains for feeding purposes has been limited toabout one-third of normal requirements, fty&amp;meam&amp;o-^ooigmbsoy-irs&apos;1 irtUflQwp^^ftdaffiTir^ and since December 1st only one-thirdof the home wheat crop can be used for feed.      It has been necessary inrecent weeks to concentrate on replenishing wheat reserves for human consumption.In accordance with the decision announced on November 22ndpreference has been given by provender millers and merchants to therequirements of cattle and sheep at the expense of poultry and pigs.    Theresult has been that the reduction in supplies available for these latterclasses of stock has been extremely severe, involving serious hardshipand forced sales of immature pigs and fowls.     The question of relaxing the preference somewhat is receiving consideration.      It is clearly desirable to avoid as far as possible a situation in which pig and poultrykeepers are forced to slaughter large numbers of foundation breeding stockalthough the alternative may mean a small reduction in milk output and atemporary small decrease in supplies of home produced beef and mutton.LivestockPrices of livestock were decontrolled on December 1st.     In thethree weeks ending 20th December the result was an appreciable increase ofactual prices over the former maximum prices in the case of cattle andPigs, but little increase in the case of fat sheep and veal calves.     Theincrease in the case of cattle and pigs was greater than would be accountedfor by the usual upward trend of prices for the Christmas trade.    following on discussions with the producers&apos; representatives the prices to be paid*hen the Government becomes the sole buyer on January 15th are now beingfixed.

Livestock ProductsFarmers&apos; demands for higher milk prices, in view of increasedosts of feeding stuffs, labour, etc., have been met in part by aromised increase in the wholesale (pool) price of 3d. per gallon in        tJanuary and February, and 2-gd. in March.The prices recently fixed by tlie Ministry of Supply for wool[still in farmers&apos; hands have given only limited satisfaction in Scotland.Land DrainageThe following steps are being taken for the promotion of land drainage j   the relaxation of conditions of grant for schemes carried outby Drainage Boards and County Councils;   promotion of legislation to giveCatchment Boards additional powers to carry out local drainage schemes;and a 50 per cent, grant for approved schemes of mole drainage on fields.This last grant and the assistance it should give in bringing new land under cultivation for harvest in 194-1 is particularly gratifying to agricultural opinion.Under-farmed Land, etc.In England and Wales the County War Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees have been authorised to take possession of 2,233 acres of derelict or badly farmed land.     In respect of 2,091 acres existingtenancies have been terminated, and the holdings will be relet to bettertenants.     In Scotland a number of similar cases have occurred.     Inaddition, in Soot land, a notice has been issued requiring a sportingproperty to be restocked with sheep, and the Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees are taking steps, with the co-operation of owners and tenants,to reduce the numbers of deer.Local authorities have been given powers to use for allotmentsany parks and open spaces under their control.Animal HealthThere were eleven outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in December.656 **ead of stock have been slaughtered, but 118 carcases have beensalvaged for human consumption.     The swine fever position has continuedto ^Prove, though special measures are remaining in force in the eastern counties.
