-   MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC WARFAREWeekly Report on Action Taken.j, war Trade Negotiations and Relations with Neutral Countries.The various War Trade negotiations have &quot;been for themost part suspended over Christmas, but are now being activelyresumed.      Progress is &quot;being made with the various specialagreements to complete the Belgian ^ar Trade Agreement.      the danish Delegation is returning very shortly,  and the Nether-lands Government have at last informed His Majesty&apos;s Ministerat The Hague that they are ready to resume the negotiationsbroken off in November.      Just before Christmas it seemed thata serious situation was likely to arise owing to the growingresentment felt in Italy and by Signor Mussolini himself atthe delays of the Contraband Control in the Mediterranean,Steps were at once taken to meet this danger, and the master of the Rolls, British Chairman of the Anglo-Italian JointCommittee, has now left on his first visit to Rome with proposals for a form of War Trade Agreement.      The welcomeoffer of\the U.S. Administration to co-operate in cutting off from Germany certain essential alloys has been actively followed up through the Anglo-French Co-ordination Committee and theChairman of the Anglo-French Purchasing Commission in the U.S.A.The control of enemy exports is to be made effective,  as fromthe 1st January,  19u1, as regards home waters,  and as fromthe 10th January 19^-0&apos;,  as regards the Mediterranean.2.        The situation in the various countries is as follows:SWEDEN3.        Information has been received that since the 26thDecember the Swedish Iron Ore Company has been working 2h hoursinstead of 16 hours per diem, and that 18 trains instead of10 have been running from the mines to Narvik.      The swedish government have been asked for an explanation of this stateof affairs/

of affairs.      In other respects, the--War-Trade^Age-eerneTut. Isoperating smoothly and there have been several satisfactory -indications that the Swedes have every intention of living tipto the spirit of the Agreement as well as its letter.h.       During the period under review,  information wasreceived from the Swedish Legation in London that,  in viewof the conclusion of the Swedish/German negotiations, there wasno longer any reason to keep secret the fact that the SwedishWar Trade Agreement had been signed.      The Swedish Governmentwere,  therefore,  anxious to publish a communique to this effect so as to relieve both parties of the embarrassmentwhich complete secrecy entailed.      An agree communique was published simultaneously in this country and in Sweden onthe 28th December, 1939,NORWAY5*        The Norwegian negotiations are continuing slowly.The most difficult questions that have arisen are the delivery of Pish and Pish Products and Iron Ore to Germany.      progress has been made on the question of Pish Products but the problemof Iron Ore is still outstanding.      Subject to these points,the framework of the draft Agreement has been prepared andis being discussed.DENMARK60       The Danish Delegation returned to Copenhagen onDecember 18th,  the negotiations having been adjourned forthe holidays.      Earlier progress has not been maintained.Although agreed on general principles,  the Danes appear very reluctant to enter into definite undertakings, particularly as regards Payments.      Pressure has been applied by notice to discontinue payment in free sterling for Danish bacon andbutter as from January 8th next,      Thersafter, payment willbe made to a Suspense Account, only to be released under theterms/

terms of a Payments Agreement now under negotiation, whichis designed to give His Majesty&apos;s Government control of Denmark1ssterling balances.7.       The Delegation have complained to His Majesty&apos;minister in Copenhagen that they were not given a square dealduring the negotiations in London,      Nevertheless they arereturning on the 3rd January.ICELAND8.       A letter to Mr,Sveinn Bj5rnsson containing thesubstance of the results of the Icelandic negotiations was signed on the 1st January by Sir George Mounsey, after adraft reply from the Icelandic Delegation had been received,which indicates that the Icelandic Government, while maintaining their protest against the British views of belligerent rights,will accept the conditions laid down in Sir George Mounsey&apos;sletter.BALTIC    STATESLITHUANIA.9.       The negotiations between His Majesty&apos;s representative at Kaunas and the Lithuanian Government regarding the sale tothe United Kingdom of 12,000 tons of flax have broken down, asthe conditions of the Lithuanian Government proved to be unacceptable to the Flax Controller.LATVIA10.       A Latvian ship carrying 870 tons of butter andbacon to the United Kingdom was seized by the Germans on herway to Sundsall and taken to Swinemimde.11.       It is feared that in view of this seizure no furtherattempts will be made to export produce from the Baltic states to the United Kingdom.FINLAND12. There is nothing special to report. Further numbersof export licences have been issued and the passage of cargoesthrough/

- k -through the Contraband Control expedited.BELGIUM13.        Informal discussion took place at Brussels onDecember 19th to decide on the procedure to be adopted in negotiating the various special agreements which will complete the Anglo-Belgian War Trade Agreement.      It was agreed that discussions on textiles,  industrial diamonds and lubricating oils should take place in London.      Negotiations regardinghides and tyres will be held in Brussels and non-ferrous metals, flax and basic slag will be discussed in Paris.    TheBelgian Delegation have arrived in London and two meetingshave taken place.     Progress has been satisfactory,  except inthe case of wool.THE NETHERLANDS1k.      His Majesty&apos;s Minister at The Hague has reported thatthe Netherlands Government are ready to resume negotiations and that the Netherlands Delegation will return to London earlyin the New Year.      Sir Nevile Bland has been instructed to emphasize the importance which His Majesty&apos;s Government attach to the speedy conclusion of a satisfactory agreement.15&apos;       Some difficulty has been experienced with theNetherlands Government owing to their growing practice ofconsigning goods to the Government which are known not tobe for its own use,  and are therefore to all intents and purposes consigned to order.      A considerable number of dutch ships were held up for some time for this reason.After an interview with Mr.Cross,  the Netherlands Ministergave him an assurance in writing that the cargoes in question were covered by export prohibitions and that no export licenceswould be granted for them.      The ships were therefore released,but there is some doubt of the value of the NetherlandMinister1 s assurance, which is somev/hat ambiguous.     Areport from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at The Hague on theposition/

position as regards export prohibitions is now awaited.SWITZERLAND16.      The negotiations which are being carried on betweenthe French and Swiss Delegations in Paris have taken a rather more favourable turn during the past ten days.      The Swiss areprepared to accept the War Trade Agreement with Belgium as abasis for negotiation and at the meeting on the 21st Decemberthey agreed to the French suggestion that four lists of commodities should be drawn up,  covering respectively (i)total prohibitions of export,  (ii) normal volume,  (iii) specialagreements with a view to reduction of exports to Germany toan agreed quota,  and (iv) no restrictions of export.      TheCommercial Secretary in Berne and his French colleague are preparing these lists, which will be examined in London and paris before submission to the Swiss experts.ITALY17.      Sir PoLoraine communicated His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;sproposals (see paragraph 1h of last Report) to Count Ciano onDecember 16th,      The latter received them favourably, subjectto the need for consultation with Signor Mussolini,  and next day told the Ambassador that the latter accepted them as abasis.      Negotiations are now proceeding with the object of drawing up a new clearing agreement.      In the meantime, HisMajesty?s Government a&apos;re actively pursuing their purchasingpolicy.18.      Count Ciano described the difficulties over italian ships as the only cloud on the Anglo-Italian horizon.      Thestrength of Italian feeling on this subject and Signor Mussolini&apos;personal resentment were further revealed in another interviewwhich Sir PoLoraine had with Count Ciano on December 22nd, inwhich the latter not only renewed previous complaints in regardto the treatment of Italian shipping, but alleged that &quot;Italy&apos;sown/

own trading operations, however legitimate, were being subjected to British control and domination,&quot;19.      In view of the rising tide of discontent on this subject,Sir P.Loraine recommended that the Master of the Rolls, who wasto have left on December 28th to take up his duties as BritishChairman of the Anglos-Italian Joint Standing Committee in Rome,should postpone his departure.      This recommendation was accepted,and steps were at once taken both to work out a long-term policyand to relieve the congestion at Italian ports by authorising the Ambassador to release all outstanding goods held up underhold-back undertakings on receipt of satisfactory guaranteesfrom the Confederations concerned.20.      In the more favourable atmosphere thus created,  the master of the Rolls left for Rome on January 1 st,  taking withhim proposals foi^ the conclusion of a form of War Trade Agreement.Under this the Italian Government would undertake to recommend to the state Monopolies and other parastatal importing bodiesthat they should enter into individual negotiations with theMinistry for agreements whereby,  subject to satisfactory standingguarantees as to destination,  agreed quantities of goods shouldbe passed automatically through the Contraband Control in a givenperiodc      Certain indications have been received which suggestthat this form of voluntary rationing stands a reasonable chanceof acceptance.      Meanwhile,  steps are being taken to improve theactual machinery of contraband control in regard to Italian ships.21.      An important agreement has been reached with the ItaliaCompany whereby they undertake,  in effect, that their shipsill not carry enemy owned goods or goods of enemy origin.SPAIN22.     We have been in consultation with the French Governmentegarding the Franco-Spanish negotiations,      Spain has asked forhree months1 credit on 175,000 tons of wheat which she desperatelyeeds,  and the French Finance Minister was at first disinclinedto grant/

grant this-      A &quot;breakdown in the.- negotiations, iuiglvt- h^av-e playedto German hands, while there is danger of a new social upheavalSpain if the food shortage is not quickly alleviated.      negotiations;-.-tions have been resumed, but fresh difficulties have arisen whichat the moment seem to have produced a deadlock.23.      In the meantime our own proposals have been worked outin London and will be ready for presentation to the SpanishGovernment in textual form by January hth or 5th.2k.      Major Campbell, the Iron Ore Controller, has made asatisfactory arrangement for the purchase of 50,000 tons of spanish ore per month, under contracts covering successiveperiods of six months 1     Our delegation has obtained satisfactorygeneral conditions for pyrites purchases,  and the Ministry ofSupply has been urged to sign purchase contracts as soon aspossible, on an annual basis.25.      The shipping situation remains substantially unchanged;Mr*CleiBtnsoiv reports that the Spanish government departmentsconcerned are hopelessly incompetent to organise the fiation&apos;*shipping resources.     Different quasi-official groups are biddingagainst one another for the tonnage available, to the advantageof no one but the owners.      Spanish ships are still not allowedto carry the coal and iron ore between North Spanish and Englishports, but we have impressed on the Spaniards that they must use their ships if they want our coal.PORTUGAL26.      Nothing to report.GREECE27*      The Greek Government have now accepted the proposalsof His Majesty&apos;s Government that their representatives should come to London for negotiations regarding the chartering of greek tonnage,  a settlement with British bondholders, and ageneral War Trade Agreement.      M,Ziffo, who is authorised tonegotiate/

negotiate on the shipping.question, was due to leave Athens onthe 29th December, and the Governor of the Bank of Greece together.,ith the Greek Minister of Finance will follow early in the Newfyear with authority to negotiate on the other questions.RgUljANIA28.      The Danube fleet of the Compagnie Continentale dTmport-ation consisting of 3 tugs and 23 barges has been purchased for7,000,000 Belgian francs.29.      The general position in regard to Danubian shipping nowbs that control has been acquired over 27 tugs, 25 oil tankfbarges and 96 grain barges.      Negotiations are proceeding regardingfen additional 3 tugs,  2 tank barges and 9 grain barges.      Furtherlenquiries are being made regarding the possibility of acquiringIcontrol over 35 Bulgarian barges.      8 tank barges belonging toIft he Asiatic Petroleum Company have been laid up.30.      The entire Danube fleet consists of about 300 tugsland 2,U00 barges.31.      A German-Roumanian Agreement was signed in&quot; the middlef December, about which full details are not available.   &apos;  Butt is understood that, as far as oil is concerned, the agreementill probably fix the upper limit of German imports at about)300,000 tons.      MraBridgeman, who has been investigating thehi position in Roumania, has now returned and is making aIleport.JGOSLAVIA32.     Mr0Nixon has concluded his negotiations at BelgradeDncerning mineral ores and an agreement with the Yugoslavtvernment was initialled on truth December.      An agreementrespect of the French mineral interests in Yugoslavia was[itialled by the French delegation on the same day.33,      The agreements are on the lines indicated in paragraphof Weekly Report No.1h, except that the Yugoslav government not now appear to demand the strict balancing of payments for/

for minerals against payments for armaments and raw materials.TURKEY3U.     The negotiations referred to in paragraph 27 of Report70. 1U are proceeding in Paris between ourselves,  the French andthe Turks.      His Majesty&apos;s Embassy are being assisted for thispurpose by a representative of the Ministry of Economic Warfare.The attempt to secure a general War Trade Agreement during thepresent negotiations has been abandoned.      In the course of further discussions regarding proposed chrome agreement, MonsieurMenemencoglu introduced new demands which were refused by theBritish and French representatives,  and which have since been modified.CHINA35.      The Chinese Government have requested that no difficultiese placed in the way of a shipment of hOO tons of wolfram andkOO tons of antimony which they wish to send from Hong Kong toiVladivostock at the end of -December.      This shipment is part ofthe barter arrangements between China and Soviet Russia,  and infreturn for such material the Soviet Government supply the Chinesefv/ith arms and munitions.      The Chinese Embassy have now beenlinformed that this December shipment will be allowed to go forward,ut that, in view of the changed situation arising from the Russianattack on Finland and the resultant resolutions of the League ofations, this decision should not be regarded as a precedent andhat no undertaking can be given that future shipments of a likeature will be permitted at present.UNITED STATES36.      The approach recently made to Mr.Purvis,  the Chairmanf the Anglo-French Purchasing Mission in the U.S.A., made byii*.Morgenthau in regard to the possibility of American cooperationln the control of certain alloys which are essential to Germanyr her war effort, and which she has to some extent been obtainingom Russia and Japan, has been discussed by the Anglo-FrenchCoordination/

Coordination Committee and a reply sent which, was largely basedon the studies of these metals prepared by this Ministry.      the reply welcomes Mr.Morgenthau&apos;s suggestion and asks for furtherinformation as to the extent to which these supplies should be restricted not only to Germany but also to Russia and to Japan.It was also suggested that the principle might be extended tocover certain other commodities such as mineral oil, rubber, tin,and carbon black which are exported from America and which wehave reason to think are reaching Germany, via Russia and Japan.As a result, Mr.Purvis had a further discussion with Mr.Morgenthwho seems to be disposed to work on the principles which we havesuggested.      A detailed study of the question has been proposed and Mr.Purvis has asked for experts to be sent out to assist himThis question is to be discussed by the Anglo-French CoordinatioCommittee.37.      Further talks have taken place with the representativesof two of the principal American cotton shipping firms and some progress has been made.      Consideration is being given to ascheme whereby cotton imports from all sources should be control by the institution of annual import quotas;      and a tentativeproposal has been made for the &quot;routing&quot; of cotton from the UnitStates by certain channels which His Majesty&apos;s Government would approve, and by means of which they would retain control over these shipments, when they had reached their final port ofdestination in Europe.*&apos; CONTRABAND CONTROL38.      During the week ending 30th December,  122 new cases ofships were dealt with and 20 previous cases,  in regard to whosecargoes or items thereof enquiries had been completed, were disposed of.39.      In 76 cases entire cargoes were released, either on firsconsideration or after enquiries.hO The/

h.o.     The system under-which adv-anc-e-- oopie-s- cdf-tnanifes-ts-of&quot;cargoes are received and considered before the ships arrivalfit ports in this country resulted, during the week under review,in 2h cases being so dealt with and in i 9 cases of the shipsconcerned being released by the Committee subject merely to the formal checking of the original manifests on their arrival atthe Control Bases.      In addition to these immediate releases,in 39 other cases the Committee&apos;s decision to release was given within 5 days or less of the arrival of ships at the control bases.Navicerts.U1.      Since the introduction of the Navicert system 7,1Mapplications for navicerts have been received up to the 30thDecember.      Of these 2,518 have been granted and us refused,while 3,5^9 are pending or have not yet been presented forconsideration.I- ENEMY EXPORTS CONTROLk2.
