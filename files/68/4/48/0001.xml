The discussions with the Danish and NetherlandsDelegations in London are proceeding satisfactorily, and good progress has also been made with the special agreements withBelgium.2. The position in the various countries is as followsSWEDEN3. Owing to the illness of the London Chairman and toM.Wallenberg&apos;s absence in Paris,  it was impossible to hold thefirst formal meeting of the Joint Standing Commission as had been intended during the past week, but a number of Standing Commissionmatters were satisfactorily settled on an informal basis.h. One of the United KingdLom Members of the standing commission was present at the Franco-Swedish negotiations inParis,  and,  although full agreement has not yet been reached,  anumber of important questions have been settled, much groundhas been covered and substantial progress made.DENMARK5.

-2-authority to initial the result of his discussions.      It was felt,however,  that the arrangements proposed were not sufficientlysatisfactory to His Majesty&apos;s Government, more particularly inthe light of the Norwegian Government&apos;s attitude to the ShippingAgreement.      Lord Glenconner was accordingly instructed so toinform the Norwegian Government,  and Mr.Hambro will shortlyproceed to Oslo with full instructions on outstanding points.The most important of these are:1 .    Pull implementation of the Shipping Agreement.2.    The signature of a Payments Agreement, and3c    Iron ore and pyrites.7. Meanwhile the French Government have raised a numberof points on the draft agreement which Lord Glenconner took withhim to Osls.      These are being examined.ICELAND8.

Pe&apos;tur Benediktsson (Secretary of the DanishLegation) has been appointed as the representative of theCommittee in London.      The French Consul in Reykjavik has beenappointed French Representative on the Joint Standing Committee.BALTIC STATESGeneral9. Germany is bringing a steadily increasing pressure tobear on these countries in order to force them not to trade withthe United Kingdom,      This pressure has so far been resisted.LATVIA10o The Latvian Minister has gone to Riga to consult hisGovernment,  and will return to London on or about February 20thwith the Latvian Trade Delegation.ESTONIA/

ESTONIA11. His Majesty&apos;s Government have so far bought 500 tons of flax in Estonia;    some of it is being forwarded overland to Odessaand shipped from there via Istanbul to England.BELGIUM12.

A joint meeting with the French and Belgian dele-gations is to be held at Paris on February 3th and it is hopedthat agreement will then be reached-THE NSTHEKLANDS13* Negotiations   have now been resumed and good progress hasbeen made,.      It is hoped that it will be possible to communicate the draft agreement to the French Government within a few days.SWITZERLAND1h.       , Since M.Alphand&apos;s visit to Sir Frederick Leith-Ross onthe 23rd January mentioned in last week&apos;s report,  several con-ferences have taken place with representatives of the FrenchMission.      These have resulted in agreement between us on theextent of the  concessions on List A,  B and C (prohibited^ export,normal and free) which the negotiators can offer at Berne,  andalso on the underlying principles we wish to attach to &quot;SpecialAgreements&quot;.

Greene has been authorised to offer up to  5 millions,if necessary.SPAIN13. Full reports have come in by bag of the meetings men-tioned in the last Report.      Our Delegation has had an uphilltask and has faced constant opposition from one member (Sr.Huete)of the Spanish Delegation.      It seems now that his objectionshave been over-ruled, but we are still uncertain of the outcome of the negotiations.      The new Cabinet crisis in Spain may result in Sr.Suner becoming Finance Minister instead of Ministerof the   Interior.      If this happens, we shall undoubtedly be faced with new opposition and possibly with a complete rejection of our proposals.PORTUGAL19. The Portuguese Government have replied to our War trade agreement proposals by an alternative proposal,  the main feature of which is a provision that, by means of certificates to beissued by British Officers m Portugal, Portuguese exports and imports of certain goods (not yet specified), up to an agreedamount, should be allowed to pass unhindered through our con-trols, except as regards exports to and imports from Mediterraneancountries, which would be excluded from the scope of theagreement.    Details of the proposal are now awaited.HUNGARY20.

A memorandum has been transmitted to the Roumanian Govern-ment protesting both against the decision of that Government to commit themselves to the supply of a fixed quantity of oil toGermany and ^ the fact that the decision was taken without the promised prior consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Minister and theFrench Ambassador,23. In order to enable His Majesty?s Government to examinethe question with full knowledge of the facts, the roumanian government was requested to supply the following information:(a) Full particulars of any promises or undertakings whichthe Roumanian Government may have made to Germany inregard to the supply of oil,  and the details of the steps by which they propose to carry out their obligation;(b) Full particulars of the armament or other supplies whichthe Roumanian Government has received,  or expects toreceive from Germany, month by month,  in return fordeliveries of oil or for other considerations.U.S.A.   and SOUTH AMERICA2h.

It is understood that, despite this local criticism,Egypt is enjoying the most prosperous cotton season for manyyears.SOVIET RUSSIA.30. Instructions have now been sent to His Majesty&apos;ambassador in China to aprproach the Chinese Government in replyto their representations about the detention of the Soviet vessel&quot;Selenga&quot; at Hong Kong.

ENEktY EXPORTS.37. The Committee met five times this week.      It reviewed 11ships,  of which one - a Norwegian vessel hound from Naples toBergen with arms for the Finnish Government - was ordered to heexpedited.    Of the others,  5 were released and 5 were ordered to discharge items of cargo to he placed in prize.38. Special interest attaches to the Dutch s.s.  &quot;BUTTENZORG&quot;in the light of the great and continuing difficulty which theCommittee has experienced over \mcertificated shipments by theDutch Government to its Colonial Governments.      A communicationhas been addressed to the Netherlands Legation in London,  towhich no reply has at present been received, informing themthat,  if shipments of this kind are to avoid interference by our control,  the items should be covered by certificates of originand stowed in easily accessible parts of the ship.      In spite ofthis hint,  the Netherlands Legation continues to send letters tothe Ministry,  stating that items of cargo,  sometimes avowedly ofGerman origin,  are being carried on specified ships;    and theCommittee felt bound to order certain of these items to beplaced in Prize.      On lb,1.....0 it was reported that the  s.s.&quot;BUITENZORG&quot; was carrying Inter alia 92 barrels of plumbago of enemy origin;    and the Committee directed that these should beplaced in Prize.      On hearing of this decision,  the shipownersrequested the Ministry to accept their undertaking that the shipwould unload, at Colombo (not normally one of their ports of callNif she might be rele sed now.    This undertaking was accepted,subject to its being put in writing and. given by the Master aswell as by the London agents -    and the Committee felt that thiswas the most satisfactory result possible in the circumstances.39- The Committee considered 136 applications for exemption,granting 69 and refusing 67,      With applications for Spain,  itfelt obliged to adopt a stricter course of action where payment was/

was to &quot;be made through the his majesty&apos;s -Rowak clearing.      (It may he explained that his majesty&apos;s  and Rowak are two German para-statalorganisations for facilitating Hispano-German trade,  of which theformer is domiciled in Spain and the latter in Germany&quot;; .      Itwas recently brought to the Committee&apos;s knowledge that Spanishbuyers of German good.s were entitled to withdraw their depositsfrom his majesty&apos;s ,  if delivery could not be effected,  end that in factwithdrawals of this kind had lately been made.4
