Thenegotiations with the Netherlands Government have at lastbeen resumed in London, and negotiations with the norwegian and Danish Delegations are continuing,      A Greek Delegationis expected very shortly, and negotiations will start thisweek.      A satisfactory agreement with the Turkish government over chrome exports has been reached in Paris,2.    The situation in the various countries is asfollows: -SWEDEN3o&apos;   There is nothing of importance to report.      TheWar Trade Agreement still appears to be working very satis-factorily.      The Standing Commission will be formally con-stituted almost immediately and,  in the meantime,  the Liembersdesignate have been dealing with the numerous day to daymatters which have arisen,ko    Mr, Marcus Vvalleriberg, who is to be Chairman ofthe Swedish portion of the Commission,  is expected in Londonshortly for the first formal meeting of the Commission andis said to be bringing a number of much-needed, statistics of swedish trade,5s    Partietilars have been received of the new Swedish-German Trade Agreement,      It appears that the Swedes haveloyally observed their undersbandings with us and have agreedt0 nothing which is ineoneis cent with the terms of our agreement.,6, Negotiations/

6.    Negotiations are continuing and arrangementse-rarding matters such, as whale-oil deliveries, metallurgical^liveries and lists of articles,  the export of which is toe prohibited, have been tentatively agreed.      On the other and progress has proved, difficult over the question of theexport of fish and fish products of purely Norwegian origin:c Germany.      The Norwegians insist on normal exports which..ean an annual export of about 150,000 tons of fish and 50,000tons of fish meal to Germany.     At present we have insisted on 60,000 tons in all.      Discussions are proceeding.D I\i&quot;.iriihv7.    Prince Axel and M. Mohr returned on 2nd January.:he remainder of the Delegation are expected on 8th January.The date for blocking sterling payments for butter and baconhas been extended for 1L. days until 22nd January,  to enablefurther discussions for the Payments Agreements to take place.BALTIC STATES:ATVIA8.    The date of the arrival of the Latvian trade delegation has not yet been fixed.ESTONIA9.    The Director of the Economic Department of theEstonian Ministry for Foreign Affairs is shortly arriving in London to discuss with His Majesty&apos;s Government thequestion of trade between the United Kingdom and Estonia.10.    The U.S.S.R. are sending raw cotton to Estonia,which is spun in Estonian cotton mills and returned to Russialn the form of cotton yarn.teiUANlA11.    In September-November inclusive,  imports intothe United/

-he United Kingdom from Lithuania were valued at  561,000,and exports from the United Kingdom to Lithuania at  39,000,shewing a balance in favour of Litlraania of  522,000. INLAND12o    Further assistance was given to the Finnishlegation by expediting the issue of export licences and thepassing of cargoes through the Contraband Control0IgLGTUM13o    The negotiations to be conducted in London forcertain of the special arrangements which will supplement the Anglo-Belgian War Trade Agreement have been concluded.The Belgian Delegation have returned to Brussels with a preliminary draft, as they anticipate that the exact wording of some of the provisions may present difficulties from thepoint of view of Belgian internal administration.      The termsagreed have been communicated to the French Government fortheir approvalolh.    Negotiations are also proceeding in Paris, but no detailed reports of progress have been received.THE NETHERLANDS15 c    The Netherlands Delegation have now returned toLondon and negotiations for a War Trade Agreement have been resumed,SWITZERLAND16c    Discussions between the French and british commercial representatives and the Swiss authorities are inProgress in Berne on the preparation of lists for a War trade agreement.ITALY17.    The decision to release all goods guaranteed to- Italian consumption detained under holdback under-takings/

- k - &apos;takings a^ Italian ports up to 28th December (see paragraphiq of last week&apos;s report) has produced an excellent effect in Italy.     New arrangements in regard to the treatment ofhulk cargoes and of goods proceeding under holdback under-takings are to be introduced on 8th January and will, it ishoped, go some way towards preventing a recurrence of the congestion at the ports which, until the recent releases,was the chief cause of complaint.18.    No report has yet been received from Rome inregard to the proposals for a War Trade Agreement which wereto be put forward by the Master of the Rolls (see paragraph20 of last week&apos;s report),19o   Negotiations for a new clearing agreement aremaking little headway, mainly owing, it is thought,  to our original proposal that freights in respect of vessels to bechartered under the shipping agreement should be paid outof the Clearing.     New instructions have been sent to sir percy Loraine which&apos;will, it is hoped, lead to swifter progress,PORTUGAL20.    The Commercial Secretary to H.M. Embassy hasrecently had interviews with Count Tovar on the subject ofthe proposed War Trade agreement      Count Tovar explainedthat consideration of our proposals had been delayed by negotiations with Spain and Italy, but he hoped to be ableto give us his Government&apos;s views on the proposals duringthe present mcntho      Though he mentioned one or two difficul-ties, Count Tovar appeared to have no doubt that an agreement would be concludedoSPAIN210    The French Ambassador at Madrid informed theUnited kingdom Delegation on 30th December that it was inthe interests/

*he interests of both, our countries that the United kingdom delegation should reach, agreement with the Spaniards asc00n as possibled     The British proposals have accordingly been communicated to the Spanish Delegation.22.    The Minister for Foreign Affairs after consult-ation with the Minister of Finance informed H.M. ambassador on 5th January that he thought agreement could he reachedalthough some of our conditions were rather severe.      he expressed the hope that war trade provisions should heembodied in an exchange of notes, to which His Majesty&apos;s,-unbassador said he was prepared to agree, subject to anycontrary instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government.23.    The Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs has agreed to a quota for British newspapers, periodicals andfilms.     The Black List of British ships has now beensuppressed and a recommendation has been made &quot;by the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs to the Minister of the Interior thatthere should he no further interference with British nationalsresident in Spain except on evidence which the ministry would be prepared to lay &quot;before the Embassy.RUMANIA.  HUNGARY.  BULGARIA AND YUGOSLAVIA21+.    Mr. Van Zwanenberg of the Ministry of Food andMr. Strass of Louis Dreyfvis and Co0, left on i+th Januaryfor Rumania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia,,      The objectof their mission is to consider the purchase of foodstuffs and feeding-stuffs from these countries from our economic warfare point of view,      They will estshllsh useful contacts,estimate the amounts of possible purchases and consider whatmachinery would he required for large scale purchases.TURKEY25.    Agreement has now been reached on the terms ofthe proposed/

..   proposed arrangement regarding chrome ore.      Under*his arrangement Turkey would not sell chrome to anypurchaser hut the U.S.A. without the consent of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the French Government.      In return the AlliedGovernments would undertake tc purchase the Turkish export-able surplus of chrome and in addition to buy raisins, figsand nuts to a value of  2,000,000 a year for the duration of^he war.     The texts of two separate agreements on chromeand dried fruits have been drawn upc      Their signature is,however, held up owing to difficulties which have arisen inthe negotiations in Paris on financial matters.      It is hopedthat these difficulties will be settled very shortly.CHINA26.    The possibilities of the Anglo-French pre-emptionof wolfram are being actively explored.     Meanwhile two representatives of the French Government have reached Indo-China where they are negotiating for 4,500 tons lying inHaiphong.EGYPT27.    Neutral countries are complaining that ourrestrictive measures for the control of Egyptian cotton areunduly severe and ignore factors which provide a strong case for increased releases at the expense of American cotton.There is some weight in the arguments put forward but until&quot;ar Trade Agreements are signed it would be unwise to relaxour precautions.U^^A.28.    The question of co-operation with the UnitedStates Government for the restriction of expo,cs oi essentialaHoys to Germany, Russia and Japan has been under active consideration during the week.      On the 5th January the AngloFrench/

French Co-ordination Committee decided to send to Washington a mission consisting of a French and British expert in economic warfare, possibly accompanied by experts in raw materials, to assist Mr. Purvis. While the instructions for the Mission were being drafted, a message was received from Mr. Purvis asking that its departure might be postponed. The reasons for this request are not yet known.

29. Mr. Purvis has reported that the U.S. Government&apos;s view is that the examination of the possibility of controlling the various essential materials should be made by informal joint group. The U.S. Government consider that a policy of a complete refusal to supply, either on the ground of "moral embargo" or of actual inability to supply, is easier for them as neutrals, than one of rationing. Mr. Purvis has explained the difficulties of the Allied Governments in this respect.

30. The question of the disposal of the supplies of molybdenum which have gone to Russia and Japan has been discussed with Mr. Morgenthau, who has represented that the possible increased demand indicated by the Allies would be inadequate to compensate for the lost markets. The attitude of the producers is, however, understood to be most helpful.

31. These discussions should be regarded as highly confidential.

CONTRABAND CONTROL

32. During the Week ending 6th January, 105 new cases of ships were dealt with and 36 previous cases, in regard to whose cargoes or items thereof enquiries had been completed, were disposed of.

33. In 84 cases entire cargoes were released, either on first consideration or after enquiries.

34. The/

Steps are &quot;being taken to strengthen the consular posts abroad whose reports have to be awaitedin many of the pending casesaENEMY EXPORTS36,    The stricter enforcement of the Reprisals Orderin Council &quot;began on Monday, 1st January.The enemy Exports Committee met eight times during theweek, It rev.iev.ed ten ships and ordered items of cargo from two to be put in Prize037o    The Committee also considered twenty-eightappliestions for specific exemption or general rulings,hvelye specific exemptions were granted (two of them prov-.Penally),  seven were postponed for further information,seven were refused and with the remaining two the Committeeail-1ected that no general ruling could he laid down.380    One application for exemption - in respect ofpare parts for an Italian Colony - calls for specialmention/

Themittee accepted the view that to grant exemptions with R. liberality was the best means of keeping the Italianvernment from taking the question up and perhaps causingese applications for shipments to Italian Colonies toase altogether.39.   Afghanistan has large uncompleted contracts with -echo-slovakia for the supply of machinery and arms.     Whilemay be politically desirable to give the Afghan Governmentmuch help as possible, the large, payments to Germanyvolved complicate the issue.      The Iranian Government have so large uncompleted arms deals with Czechoslovakia.      They .ye been asked for full details and each case is beingeated sympathetically on its merits.
