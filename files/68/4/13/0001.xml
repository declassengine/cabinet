PROPAGANDA, DECEMBER 1 to 15, 1939.(Prepared by the Department for Publicity in Enemy Countries.)IHIS analysis of German propaganda covers the period from the 1st to theof December.The arrangement follows the same lines as the previous analysis. Germanaganda, by wireless, press and cable, is divided into a number of lines whichefficiently stable to provide a basis for comparison.firstly, a short summary is made of the major trends of propaganda duringast fortnight.A brief description is then given of each of these lines with some indicationeir relative importance in German propaganda directed to (1) the Germanpopulation: (2) Great Britain; (3) France;&apos; and (4) neutral countries. Inmargin beside each item are placed percentage figures showing itsIllative importance in relation to the total &quot;propaganda in each of these fourions. In brackets after each figure is shown the corresponding percentageprevious fortnight. &quot;table is then given summarising the relative importance of these variousol propaganda.iiuilly there is given in an appendix an account of the German propagandaUlei&apos;t of the Russo-Finnish war. &apos;forttuMhS ^trikiuS feature iii the pattern of German propaganda during thegut is the growing concentratipn pn a small number of themes at the10?81   [20524] B
expense of all others.   The principal lines of propaganda in order 0fimportance are (1) British weakness.(2) British brutality and unscrupulousness.(3) German strength.(4) Britain the enemy of neutrals.(5) Britain lies.These five themes comprise between them 70 per cent, of the total of propaganda.While anti-British propaganda as a whole has remained steady, the inoin anti-French propaganda, which was noticed in the last analysis, hasmaintained.The principal events reacting upon German propaganda during \\fortnight were (a) The publication of the German White Book.(b) The safe arrival of the Bremen.(c) The naval battle off Montevideo.The treatment by the German Propaganda Ministry of the Russian iirof Finland, clearly a source of embarrassment. Avas a study in the art of kone story by another.It is becoming clear that the main body of German propaganda eon:variations on a single theme.   This theme may be expressed in the phr&quot; Britain the Crumbling Monster.&quot;The relative importance of individual lines within this single concemay change, but the intensity of the whole theme remains remarkably eon:It is expressed with almost equal force in propaganda for Great Britainthe neutrals and for Germany itself, accounting for over two-thirdspropaganda.Even for France, where propaganda has hitherto been designed on a spattern, there is a gradual conformation to the general scheme. It is dito believe that this constancv is not the result of a deliberate decision.Germany, 15%Britain, 15%France, 13%Neutrals. 16%(10%)(9%)(10%)(12%)1. German Strength.During the current fortnight the theme of German strength has begrreturn to its former importance. This has been largely due to the pungiven to the return of the Bremen and to the first phase of the naval aoff Montevideo. The exploits of the Graf Spee were represented as &quot;a viagainst a threefold British superiority.&quot; The inactivity of the Germanhas given little scope for propaganda. Air victories, however, are suiexploited.Second in importance to her naval strength is the impregnability of liewar economy and the assistance to be expected from Russia, Japan andIt is interesting to note that the attitude taken up throughout i?&quot; Germany cannot be beaten &quot; rather than &quot; Germany will be victorious,emphasis is always upon the defence rather than upon the attack.Germany, 10% (13%)Britain, 10% (10%)France, 4% (6%)Noutrals. 11 % (16%12. Great Britain the Enemy of Neutrals.This theme has decreased in importance owing to a loss of propaj?interest in the British export blockade. Emphasis is still laid on the irdone to neutral trade, and on the fact that it is neutral and not Germanthat suffers. The whole question of the blockade, however, is giving way to more general charge that Britain is attempting to drive the neutrals intowith Germany.3.

This is the german propaganda Ministry&apos;s reply to the British conception of a blockadedGermany. Great Britain, with inadequate naval forces, is fighting;i losing battle to keep open the sea-routes on which her very existencedepends.ie British economic system has been proved incapable of adapting itselfto the strain of war conditions, and can only be kept going by recourse to the much-condemned methods of National Socialist economy.&apos;&apos; Mr. Muddler &apos;&apos; (taken from the British press) has been portrayedas an insurmountable obstacle to the development of the requiredefficiency.ie increasing opposition of the Labour party and the growth ofdefeatism are undermining Britain&apos;s war efforts.reat Britain is being thrust aside by the dictates of historical necessity.Tbis collapsing system is defended by a Government of weak old menand political nonentities.i$$en$ions in the British Empire.Tbilo great interest is taken in other signs of British decadence, less Germany, 5% C8%)lion is paid to dissensions in the Empire.

The Secret Service, notcontent with having murdered his father and his grandfather, has now made an attempt on the life of the young King of Iraq. A conspiracyagainst Mustapha Kemal was fortunately foiled in time. The currentactivities of the Service included sabotage in Roumania and Yugo-slavia, and machinations in Slovakia. &quot; Thus England fights againstright and justice1-by poison and treacherous murder.&quot;Britain is the Vampire of the Continent.&quot; Throughout history GreatBritain has ruthlessly exploited the European nations for her ownends. Just as she has driven France and Poland into war withGermany, and Finland into war with Russia, she is now using theLeague of Nations in an attempt to set the rest of Europe ablaze:&apos; &quot; &apos;The British Empire is the greatest slave-realm of the world.&quot; Britainbas won her Empire by cunning, treachery and violence, andmaintains it by cruelty and oppression. Only because she has installedpuppet Governments do the so-called &quot;free Dominions&quot; remain within her Empire.seems to be the policy of the German Propaganda Ministry to wring anf.v story out of every incident.

Otherual items, however, deserve mention.German propaganda champions the rights and claims of Italy and Japan,in so far as they conflict with the interests of the Allies. In particular,Italy&apos;s demands for control of the exits from the Mediterranean are approved.Prominence is given to appreciation by foreign countries of German&quot; Ivultur &quot;&apos; here is a great deal of material in German home propaganda describing the derelict condition of Poland and the magnificent achievementsof German reconstruction.German propaganda has begun to lay consistent emphasis on Turkishweakness.
