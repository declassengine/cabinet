OiSICtN AND FRONTIER&quot;&quot;RELATIONS:U^Uhanij3tanAs the German and Italian wireless continued torive currency to reports of Russian troop concentrationsnear the frontiers of Persia and Afghanistan and of counter-measures taken in those countries, publicity wasriven by the B.B.C. and in the press to Afghan denials ofthe truth of these reports so far as they concernedAfghanistan.   A report has now been received on the visitDi British officers to Kabul to discuss Afghan Army andAir Force training.   Not much progress was made with thissubject.   The Afghan Ministers are very apprehensive ofRussian aggression in Northern Afghanistan and laid stress&apos;ui the question of financial assistance for a large programme of equipment for the Afghan Army.liorth-West Frontier and North-West Frontier province.Major Duggal and two Hindus captured with him (seereports for periods ending 30th November and 31st December)&apos;ere brought into Sararogha by friendly tribesmen on the january.   Negotiations for their release hadpptlnued during the past fortnight and had secured the^-operation of the Mahsud tribe who, when seen in jirgaj tue Resident, seemed anxious to remain on friendly-&apos;-&apos;3 with Government.It is hoped that these contacts will lead to anPfovement in the situation in Waziristan.    Thislj-0ues to be somewhat disturbed, and affects the

nPignbouring district of Bannu, in the North-West frontier province, where two serious incidents have recentlyoccurred.   The first was a raid on the night of January7t&apos;n/5th, when a gang of about 30 men broke into the CivilHospital, Bannu, and kidnapped three Hindus.    The secondvas on the 8th January when a party of regular indian troops in a lorry, forming road protection troops, wereambushed by a hostile gang near Latanbar on the Bannu-Kohat road and in the ensuing encounter lost six menkilled and fourteen wounded, together with ten rifles.IV.    INDIAN STATESOne of the results of the agitation which has been encouraged by Congressmen in the Indian States during thepast two years, with a view to the establishment in theStates of responsible governments, has been an increase inthe number of communal organisations and a growth ofcommunal ill-feeling in the States.    This development hasno doubt been actuated by the fear that an extension of responsible government in the&quot; States would precipitate ascramble there between the communities for political power.The increase in communal tension has been particularlynoticeable during the past few months and a new factor isthe recent establishment of an &quot;Indian States muslim league&quot; with branches in Hyderabad, Bikaner, Jodhpur andother States.   Disturbances resulting from communal enmityare a possibility which has to be faced at present inffiany States.In most of Rajputana and Kathiawar famine conditionstontinue to prevail.   The States in that part of India are-n-s being compelled to undertake considerable expenditureespect of relief measures and will have correspondinglymoney available to devote to the improvement of their

nistratlons which is in some cases most desirable in.r to reduce their vulnerability to agitation.   There is.19 hope of any great improvement in the situation,re the burst of the next monsoon.V. ECONOMICNothing to report.VI. FINANCE   &apos;: exportsWhen the pound sterling left the gold standard inember 1931, gold began to be exported from India, on-ate account, on a largo scale.   The process hasinued ever since, but the volume of exports showed anution from year to year.   The outbreak of war,ver, and the fresh increase in the sterling price ofi, provided a new impetus; and the amount exported in.four months September to December 1939 was as much asmill ions1, worth, equal to the amount exported in theceding eleven months.   The -total amount exported fromember 1931 to December 1939 has been of the value of3 millions.   The private export of gold has since the-Teak of war, as I indicated in my fourth report, beener control, and can only take place under licence.   This-;res that the resultant accretions of foreign exchange11 come within the control of the authorities, and sosngthen our dollar resources. .Z.Terrace, s.W. 1.h January 1940.
