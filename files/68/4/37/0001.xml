January 23, 1940.THIS Analysis of German Propaganda covers the period from thet lo 15th January.The arrangement follows lines similar to those of the previous Analysis.Serman propaganda is divided into a number of lines intended to provide aasis for comparison.Hie classification and arrangement of these lines have been reorganisedii order to give a clearer picture of the whole framework.    &quot; Militaryperations&quot; are now shown separately from &quot;German Strength&quot; andBritish Weakness.&quot;    &quot;Germany the Friend of Neutrals&quot;  has beeneluded in &quot; German Strength,&quot; and &quot; Dissensions in the British Empire &quot;P   British Weakness.&quot;   Other minor changes have been made, and theterns rearranged for the sake of greater clarity.firstly, a short summary is made of the major trends of propagandaunng the past fortnight.A brief description is then given of each of these lines.   In the margin-uie each item are placed percentage figures showing its comparativeportance in relation to the total propaganda directed to (1) the Germanome population; (2) Great Britain; (3) France; and (4) neutral countries.a brackets aftm- ^o^v, g^.-----l______\/ .- v &apos; -reviomets after each figure is shown the corresponding percentage for thefortnight.A table is then given summarising the relative importance of thesean,,us hues of propaganda.Inially, there is given in an Appendix a summary of the confidentialropaganda &quot; Leads &quot;, issued by the Propaganda Offices of the National-lahst Party and of the German Labour Front during the month ofcember.LuSl3^-2   [20685]B
No major events occurred to influence the course of German propnThe current fortnight can, therefore, be regarded as a return toafter the excitement of the Graf Spee, the Heligoland air battle andChristmas holidays.The most striking development during the past fortnight has Wincrease in the theme of &quot; British Weakness.&quot;   This theme, together&quot;&quot;British Brutality and Unscrupuiousness.&apos;&apos; comprised 45- per cent ,German propaganda.These two were followed, at a considerable distance, by &quot;fStrength &quot; and &quot; Military Operations.&quot;While anti-British propaganda as a whole has remained stationanti-French propaganda has continued to increase, particularly to FrancGermany, 8% (6%)Britain, 10% (14%)Franco, 11% (8%)Neutrals, 12% (8%)1. German Strength.The most important sub-division of this theme was the strengthGermany&apos;s war economy and her immunity to the British blockade. Inwords of the New Year message of Field-Marshal Goring : &quot; The brazen]of war has determined the communal life of our people.    Under this the whole German economic life has been formed.   The conversion of economy into war economy has been effected quickly and surely.&apos;&apos;Next in order of importance was the social and internal political siredof Germany. Germany has solved her social problems and attaijunshakable National Socialist unity under Hitler.Some play was also made with the support of Germany&apos;? ineiparticularly Russia and Italy, and with the cultural ties between GermJand Spain.

Neutrals Oppose Allies.This line comprises that part of &quot; Britain the Enemy of Neutrjwhich is concerned with the active opposition of neutral countries toAllies. The injury done by the Allies to the neutrals is relegated to &quot; BijBrutality&quot; and ,: French&apos; Brutality.&quot;The most important single item was Italian resentment against]&quot; Imprisonment in the Mediterranean.&quot; It was also stated that theirStates had been alienated by the failure of the Allies to pay their war&apos;1and by the British seizure of mails.Germany, 25% (18%)Britain, 31% (24%) &apos;Franco, 151% (11%)Neutrals, 25% (20%)4.

I&quot;propaganda British rationing was stressed.A theme of equal importance in propaganda to Great Britain.&apos;not to other countries, was the rottenness of British social life.

Anti-Semitism.The real importance of this theme is difficult to calculate.

APPENDIX.Summary of Confidential Propaganda Leads issued by the Propaganda -of the National Socialist Party and the German Labour Front for tkof Speakers and Editors, December 1939.A Ibion is Recognised!RIBBENTROP said on the 24th October in Danzig :-&quot;So Chamberlain did not come to Munich to prevent war, but on!-postpone the war already decided upon by the British Government.&quot; This&apos;have shocked many Germans, but National Socialists had long ago reeoathis fact.It was necessary to deceive the world. Thus, the British Foreign Miniin his speech to the R.I.I.A. in June 1938 (sic), said : &quot;None of us haswish to cause difficulties for other countries. It is not our aim to hinder legitirdevelopment, or to encircle any nation with a ring of enemies. . Still less dowish to interfere with a system of government which perhaps is not to our likiLord Halifax said these words only shortly before the then CAmbassador in Paris, Osusky, wrote to Krofta to the effect that Great Briwas very anxious to obtain time, and that the question of gaining time pian important, if not a decisive role. MassigTi (said Osusky) stated thatEnglish knew war to be inevitable.Because the favourable moment had not come even by September 1935,British Press excelled itself in hypocritical relief at the avoidance of war.August 1938 the Press was writing about war &quot; Never Again ! &quot; In the s&quot;of 1939 the same Press was writing about peace and agreement &quot; Never AgaiNot only the Press but British statesmen after Munich pretended toreat the avoidance of war. But gradually even British statesmen were comrto admit that war had been avoided at Munich only because of Britaimsniil&apos;unpreparedness.In order not to repeat the mistake of 1914, when England had toooproclaimed her desire to destroy German economic competition. Chambecontinued to talk peacefully, even after the occupation of the Protectorate,wished to make England appear to the world as a misunderstood apostle of i&apos;persecuted shamefully by the trouble-maker, Germany.In August 1939, however, The Times published an article sayingGermany&apos;s place in the sun lay not in the obtaining of Lebensraum. but&apos;incomparable discipline and skill. That is truly English! Thiswhich, with its 46 million men, occupies a quarter of the surface of theand owns the most bountiful and valuable lands in the world, owning a!materials, with empty spaces and untilled soil in abundance, knowing no 1nourishment or shortage of ground this people, or its responsible leaders,not only to cut off an 80-million people from all the riches of this earth, icompress it together into the narrowest space, simply in order to keep it tunder British control.The Times clearly expresses that if Germany is not content to accefate, she will inevitably be encircled and, therefore, destroyed.The fact that this British point of view is nothing new, but is tradiamong the Britons, is shown by a book published long ago by Com1&quot;Kenneth Edwards, in which the author says that the British Fleet will stand between Germany and its future.   In order to increase the effectivethe British Blockade, said the author, the extension of the Reich towa.North or the East should be prevented.In her foreign policy England does not need to bother aboutfood or raw materials.   Therefore, she does not need to fight any war;But England does conduct wars, simply in order to maintain her ddminaWthe world.   The English Press says that British policy aims at peacesbalance of power, but that the first must be subordinated to the second.A disturbance of the balance of power is always answered bv K&quot;?&apos;war, as in 1914 and 1939.
i England fights she does so with the most scurvy weapons.   She&quot;&quot;nised the &quot;Teat cartels of world industry for the purposes of war; she has&apos;&quot;-!n iriii&apos;r the blockade for two years, as Chamberlain himself admitted; she[eel out commercial espionage even in neutral countries.methods have been employed by England for centuries with success;- the Continent have been set against each other, and the only victorEngland, who meanwhile added to her Empire outside Europe,ojauas success in getting other peoples to fight for her has been due tooiistrous intrigues and lying propaganda.   But now a Germany has arisen,.&apos; through England&apos;s tricks and tears asunder the web of lies.i;t first success of the German work of enlightenment has been to preventlid from mobilising any countries except France against us.   A no smallers has been that the blockade is rendered useless.-],a&apos;t has seemed impossible for 300 years will come to pass in this war-eteing of Germany, and therewith the freeing of all other nations from thejanship and desire for domination of Great Britain.Tie remaining notes are occupied entirely with a category of events during,,titled &quot; Year VII of the National Socialist Work of Construction.&quot; Theare chosen to illustrate the social, economic and political achievements ofich. but no propaganda comments are added, except for the remark : &quot; Theuctive work of National Socialism has not been interrupted by the war on (Sermany.&quot;)
