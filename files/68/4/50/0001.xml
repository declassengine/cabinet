Twenty-second weekly Report on the Oil Position.KS. Stocks of petroleum for the Services show no appreciablechange from those exhibited iii last week&apos;s return;    but it is interesting to note that the stocks of fuel and diesel oil forthe Admiralty and of aviation spirit for the Air Ministry havesteadily shown small increases over the past few weeks.     Afurther increase also took place    in the stock of luricating oil for the War Office, which now represents 90 per cent, of thereserve aimed at for the end of 19M-0.On the civil side stocks of motor spirit and of keroseneexceed the quantities held at the outbreak of war.      discussions have taken place with representatives of the Petroleum board with the object of securing an improvement in the position of the stocks of fuel, diesel and gas oil.       Arrangements are beingmade to stop, temporarily, exports of creosote which can be used as fuel oil.fiillRS. The number of tankers which arrived in this country duringthe week was eighteen, of which four were engaged on admiralty service.     This represents a substantial fall compared with thearrivals during the previous week but as pointed out in lastweek&apos;s report considerable fluctuations in the weekly arrivalsmust be expected.Particulars in respect of the past six weeks, together withthe weekly average for the three pre-war months and for september, October, November and December are set out in Table II.PORTS. The decrease in the number of tanker arrivals is reflected in the tonnage of imports during the week shown in Table III.There was a reduction of nearly 90,000 tons.The total imports during January (Table IV.) were slightly lower than those for December.

The forward programme for the four weeks ended2nd March (Table V.), shows an improvement over thatcontained in last week&apos;s report, but apart from Admiraltyarrivals is at about the same level as January imports.No substantial improvement in the position can he expected until more Norwegian tankers are in Allied, service.SUMPTION&quot;. Table VI., showing consumption from civil stocks,reveals a decrease in all products compared, with the previousweek.     This is probably due in the main to adverse weather conditions both consumption and deliveries to consumersbeing affected thereby.The following tables are appended:Table I.       Stocks (a) Service(b) Civil.Table IIa Tanker arrivals0Table III. Tonnage of imports on weekly basis.Table IV.
