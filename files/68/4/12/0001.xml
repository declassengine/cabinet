INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.xhere has been the usual diminution in activity over the holiday period there is nothing of special significance to report.     The principalticn 0f interest remains that of the relationship of wage levels to prices.At the end of the first four months of the war it can be said that the-istence of joint voluntary machinery on a firm basis in so many industriess been of great value in enabling an orderly transition to war conditions to- achieved.    Even in the few cases where disputes and differences have leda temporary deadlock necessitating conciliation action the final settlement as been reached through the recognised machinery.EMPIjOYMENT AND U3MPL0YMENT.The results of the monthly count of unemployed taken on 11th December, areow to hand and will be published to-day.     Sufficient is known of them to bele to say that the decrease that was recorded by the previous count hascntinued.     There is as yet, however, no sign of the beginning of the large andapid expansion that will be required.     This is largely a problem of theineering industry, where the shortage of unemployed skilled workers stillrsists in an acute form.     Divisional Controllers1 reports indicate that theelaxation of Custom Agreement has not yet achieved any extensive results, havingegard to the magnitude of the problem, and it will be necessary to take activeeps in the near future to ensure that the position improves.     I am hoping,th the co-operation of my colleagues in the Supply Departments to see theagement Board of the Engineering Employers Federation to lay the whole problemfore them.     In the meantime, Local Offices have been instructed to establishntact at once with the Local Secretaries, both of the Employers&apos; Side and theade Union Side of the &quot;Dilution&quot; Committees, for the discussion of localolems of shortages that are arising.Since 11th December, it is apparent that a considerable volume of employmentresulted from the Christmas Season but an equally sharp decline must be lookedwhen that season finishes.     Other factors which will contribute to dimunitionemployment are the seasonal decline in the agriculture and building industries,completion of A.R.P. works and the temporary dislocation of the transport of^ to wagon hold-up, to which reference is made below.     The improvementiightin shops that is being effected should assist in maintaining employment

intheretail trade and progress in the obscuration of industrial lighting.[,0U]d assist towards the absorption of more unemployed.      One difficulty-n the way of expansion that has already come to notice is that, during theer months at least, workers are not able to conform to the earlier and later working hours involved by double shifts.     This is having the effectinducing them to obtain work nearer home*A detailed analysis of the long-term unemployed is being made with aview to seeing how far they can really be regarded as available for the war effort.    A large number are elderly persons who, by reason of loss offficiency or indifferent health are unlikely to find employment again inheir normal occupation.Hie Supplementary Register has now been established in various centresd the work of registering particulars and of -classification is proceeding,separate office for the Register is being acquired in London.The following notes show the position in particular industries.     Thesit ion of the engineering industry has already been dealt with,ilding Industry.The total number of wholly unemployed workers aged 18-64 years (excludingasuals and temporarily stopped) in the Building Industry at 11th Decemberas 140,198, representing an increase of 7,706 as compared with 27th November,ut a decrease of 52,501 as compared with 12th December, 1958.   The number ofilled men excluding painters unemployed at 12th December was 40,664, 13,339-re than at 27th November and 4,309 more than at 12th December, 1938.     Aonsiderable increase .in&apos; the number of plasterers unemployed accounts for arge part of the total increase in unemployment among skilled men as compared, th a year ago and slaters and tilers have also suffered a proportionatelyavy increase in unemployment.     On the other hand, unemployment amongarpenters has decreased over the period.In general, while certain skilled occupations have suffered from being lessptable to Government emergency work, the Government programme and the A.R.P.rkj now &quot;being undertaken for Local Authorities and private firms, hasGained employment in the building occupations at or near the normal levelthe winter season and the impact of the dislocation which is inevitable undertime conditions and of the measures of control adopted to preserve financial

sources and essential materials for war purposes has fallen most severelythe smaller and medium sized contractors An the building industry and onhe professional cesses dependent on private and municipal building work,re problem of easing the position for both these classes is receiving themsideration of the Works and Building Priority Sub-Committee.The demands of the Armed Forces for skilled building and constructionalrorkers may be expected to make a considerable inroad on the supply but theffect of this demand on the reserve of unemployed skilled building labour has not yet been reflected in the unemployment statisticsoCoal Mining a10.    While the general position remains satisfactory there has been a marked increase of intermittent short time working at many collieries, particularlyin Wales, Northumberland and. Durham, due to the continued scarcity of wagons and to delays in the ports.     This has accounted for an increase in some areasin the numbers of miners registered as temporarily stopped, whilst the numbersof wholly unemployed are still dropping.     Some shortages of labour have beeneported, but they are not substantial and the labour requirements of theindustry are in general being satisfactorily met.     Shortages in the Kent andSomerset mines are of long standing and are not due to the War, though   theymay to some extent have been aggravated since recruiting from other mining areas, which are now active, has naturally dropped off.Textiles.11.    The cotton industry has continued to improve and there is an increasingshortage of little piecers and weavers.     Various expedients are being adoptedy employers to meet the position with some degree of success, but it is not likely that the shortages will be overcome, at least for some time.12.    The woollen, worsted and hosiery trades have also been increasinglyactive and the carpet trade has shown an improvement though the transition tolanket weaving still continues.     Shortages of skilled workers in the woollen and jute trades are reported from several areas, and employers are importingconsiderable numbers of workers from other areas.     Industrialists are,however, more anxious about the supply of materials than of labour and manyplaints have been made regarding the effect of the wool rationing scheme,the hosiery trade, a number of Scottish firms are already working short3.

time, owing to the scarcity of materials and there is said to be a general expectation that the wool rationing scheme will shortly lead to increasedunemployment.     Similar reports are made from Bradford and Huddersfield.Clothing.15.     The dressmaking and millinery trades are very slack and the tailoringtrade in London has suffered from the seasonal decline, though it has been set off by work on Government contracts.     The boot and shoe trade continuesto he busy and in London has benefited particularly from the reductionin American and Swiss imports.-    Similarly the drop in foreign imports ofgloves lias helped the South Western glove trade, which is particularlybusy.Fishing.14.     There has been an increase of unemployment at Great Yarmouth andLowes toft owing to the cessation of fishing by the Scottish Fleet and thefurther requisitioning of trawlers by the Admiralty.     A large number of scottish boats have gone to the local winter fishing in the West and asa result, the usual seasonal increase consequent on the return from theEast Anglian waters has been kept lower than usual.     Another factor inthis is undoubtedly the number of fishermen who have volunteered for naval Service.     Since the beginning of December unemployment has decreasedin nine of the ten principal Scottish ports;   there was an increase only at Fraserburgh.Shipping Service.15.    Considerable difficulty is being experienced in obtaining engineers and deck ratings, shortages being reported from Gravesend, Clydeside, Wales,Middlesbrough, Newcastle, Seaham Harbour and West Hartlepool.     A largeproportion of the men registered at the Exchanges are catering staff, andthe Shipping Federation is operating three training schemes in an endeavourto fit. some of these men for work as deck hands.     There are stillnumbers of able seamen registered in Scotland, mainly in the North and western Islands, but there have been numerous refusals of employment bythese men on various grounds including unwillingness to sail in ships not,in convoy.

port Transport.16.     There is no change of any importance in the last two weeks.     Theaverage numbers unemployed have remained in the region of 22,000 to25,000 which is still below peace-time level, and there is little doubtthat considerable numbers of the more casual type of dock worker have moved off into other employment.     London has continued to be busy andthe unemployment total, though it increased slightly before the holidayremains low by peace-time standards.Agriculture.17.     The end of the harvest season is having its normal effect in dis-placing a considerable number of unskilled workers, particularly women.This is especially marked in the South Eastern, Eastern and North MidlandsDivisions.     On the other hand, in certain types of skilled labour the exigencies of war-time are causing a shortage.     In North Eastern and north Western Divisions it has been difficult to find skilled plough-men for the particularly intensive campaign for ploughing up grassland.The calling-up of men for military service and the attraction of other types of employment are also contributing to the soarcity.     NorthWestern Division, for instance, reports apprehension as to the effecton the supply of agricultural labour of a new Government factory atOrmskirk.     In North Eastern Division the Agricultural Y/ages Committeehave been forced to increase the minimum rates of wages for adult maleworkers.18.     Despite these difficulties, farmers in the majority of areas seemto be reluctant to find substitutes for their ordinary labour in theWomen&apos;s Land Army.     Only in Banff shire is there any substantial signthat women are being engaged and trained in agricultural work.Hotel and Catering and Distributive Trades.19*    In both these industries the approach of Christmas is giving itsusual seasonal stimulus to employment.     The extent of this, however,varies substantially in different areas.     In vulnerable areas, such asndon, Portsmouth and Chatham, or any plaoes where hotels have been

reauisitioned for War Purposes but not yet filled, such as Margate andother South Coast ports, the Improvement has been very much less than in normal years, and unemployment is still very severe.     In other places,however, there is a very marked revival of activity and in North WesternDivision particularly, no doubt as a result of an exceptional influx ofevacuated and newly established Government Departments, the seasonalimprovement in employment has been up to normal and unemployment is actually less than at the corresponding period last year.Food.20.    The same general conditions prevail as reported in previous surveysof the labour supply position.     Trade is fairly busy and, in particular,London, Eastern and Southern Divisions report activity on government contracts.     At Reading, for instance, there have been large demands for  women workers in biscuit factories.     In a few cases War-timescarcities are leading to difficulty.     Scotland reports that the shortageof grain is handicapping the distilling industry and in the South WesternDivision the baking trade has been hit by the calling-fup of men forMilitary Service.Pottery.21.    Midlands Division, where the bulk of this trade is centred, reportsa slight rise in the Live Register, as many firms completed theirChristmas orders at the beginning of the month.     Exports, however, arecomparatively good.     In South Eastern Division, on the other hand,exports appear to have slumped.     In general the section of the industryvrtiich is concerned with sanitary appliances is suffering from the curtailment of private building.Seamen.22.    There are general reports of difficulties in filling vacancies forable-seamen and for engine-room staffs.     In part this i3 due to the calling-Up of Naval Reservists.     On the other hand, Northern Divisionreports that seamen and firemen are reluctant to sail without convoys

and there are complaints that some are obtaining shore work.     Scotlandreports that many seamen are registered in the North and Western Islesand attempts to transfer them to other Scottish ports and to Cardiffand North Shields have not been altogether successful.     It is hoped,however, that this position will improve in the New Year.23.    Unemployment continues to he severe among stewards and cateringstaffs generally.     Efforts are, however, being made to submit suitablemen for work as ordinary deck-hands and Southern and South .EasternDivisions report the beginning of arrangements for training stewards inother sea-going work.Clerical and Office Workers.24.    Unemployment shows a perceptible hut slight decline in NorthernDivisions.     This is probably due to seasonal causes.Private Domestic Service.25,     There was a negligible change in the position in this group duringthe month, and it continues to be heavily depressed, particularly in evacua-tion areas.Shipbuilding.26.    The demands for skilled workers, particularly for shipwrights, arevery heavy and,as-in the engineering industry, there is an acute shortage.Manufacture of Metals.27.    The supply of workers has been generally satisfactory, although local shortages have arisen.     There has been no outstanding difficulty insatisfying the requirements notified,^plosives and Chemicals.28.    The labour position at production factories continues to be generally satisfactory.     The requirements of factories where  oonstruc-ion has not yet been completed have been estimated, and particulars ofsuitable workers, mainly women, have been registered.

THE CENTRAL REGISTER.The following statistical summary shows for the period up to- December, 1959, the number of vacancies notified to the Central Register,e number of people submitted for the vacancies and those notified to thatte as engaged.tatemsnt of Orders received, Persons recommended. Submissions made andtifications of Placings from the outbreak of War to 31st December, 1959.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.15th Dec. 193931st Dec.elled betweenDec.31st Dec.No. ofOrders602606624658Number of PersonsRequired5,2722115,48345,479Recommended byPanels9,30877010,07810,078Submitted toEmployers5,2604365,6965,696No. ofpersonsnotifiedas placed2,1071962,3032,303FIRMS.15th Dec.31st Dec.celled betweent Dec.51st Dec.88354199115501905491,4787529537101,553332101,55533210TOTALS.Departments131st Dec.658905,4795497486,028vhich no candidatesapproached i       6071710,0781,5535,6963322,3031011,6316,0282,313The demands received during the period 16th - 31st December fall into thefollowing categories:-Scientific 13Industrial 43professional 52Administrative etc.    112220Included in the requirements notified since the outbreak of War are 6 orderscovering 118 posts carrying commissioned rank.In addition to the 2,313 persons notified as placed, 68 persons with linguisticqualifications below Central Register standard have been appointed to the?he number of meetings of Panels held between 16th and 31st December was 8.W the 31st December, the number of effective cards of persons who have applied to be enrolled on the Central Register - including persons who havebeen notified as appointed - was 84,784.

50.   A review of the position from the outbreak of war shows that in a periodof four months, 6,028 vacancies were notified.     It will be noted that inrespect of 717 of these vacancies, no submissions had been made at the dateof the return.     In the same period 6,028 persons were submitted (the identity of the two figures is no more than a coincidence).     During that period,2,313 persons were notified as engaged, including 196 notified during thefortnight ended 31st December.     Owing to the incidence of Christmas holidaysthe latter figure is the lowest fortnightly figure since the middle ofOctober.     A number of placings actually made in 1939 will not be notifieduntil January, 1940, whilst some submissions made in the last quarter of 1939will only result in placings in the New Year, owing to some Departmentsplacing Orders which anticipate their needs.31.   The number of effective cards of persons on the Central Register as atthe 31st December, was 84,784.TRAINING-.32.   Recruitment of unemployed civilians for the Government Training Centresslowed down, mainly owing to the Christmas holiday.RECRUITING.33.   On the 1st January a Proclamation was signed by His Majesty The Kingunder the National Service (Armed Forces) Act.     -The Proclamation direotsthat with certain statutory exceptions all male British subjects withinGreat Britain on the 1st January, 1940 or entering Great Britain after thatdate, who are not already registered under the National Service (Armed Forces)Act or under the Military Training Act, and who on the 1st January, 1940had reached the age of 19 but had not reached the age of 28, are liable to-be called up for service in the Armed Forces of the Crown.3A.   This is the third Royal Proclamation to be made under the Act.     its effect is to extend the liability for military service to- &apos; - - ; ; -(i) Men of 19 years of age;(ii) Men who have reached the age of 20 since the 1st December, 1939(the date of the last Royal Proclamation made under the Act), and(iii) Men who on 1st January, 1940 were 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27 years of age.

T- is difficult to form an accurate estimate of the number of men who willhe affected but a conservative estimate would place the figure between1 500,000 and 2,000,000 men.35.   The signing of the Proclamation was preceded by a full press conference at the Press and Censorship Bureau of the Ministry of Informationv/hich was attended by representatives of the foreign as well as of theBritish press and was given widespread publicity.     The registration ofthe men will not take place immediately nor will all the men be requiredto register at the same time.     The registration and calling up will,as hitherto, follow a carefully worked out plan and the speed at whichit will take place will be regulated solely by the man power requirementsof the three fighting forces.     It is contemplated that the men will be registered at intervals in batches and all those directly affected willbe informed by public announcements and by a widespread publicity campaign when the registration for their particular age group is totake place.36.   An undertaking was given by the Secretary of State for War duringthe passage of the Bill through Parliament that men under 20 years ofage would not be called up for service for the time being.     Accordingly,while the men will in general be registered and called up for service as hitherto in age order, the youngest first and the oldest last, no person will be required to register (and will not accordingly becalled up for service) until he has reached the age of 20.     Considerablea:nphasis was laid on this point at the press conference.

37,    Eaoh time a registration takes place it is contemplated thai; acertain number of men who have attained the age of 20 since the lastregistration will be required to register together with men belonging to thericher age groups.     This system will ensure a oontinued supply of skilledtradesmen for the Forces from the 20 to 21 age group which will always containb valuable reservoir of skilled men who are just below the age of reservationfor their particular occupation and whose services are required in theArined Forces in their trade capacity.     The procedure for registration, medical examination and calling up will be substantially the same as hitherto.38.     The Military Service (Hardship) Committees which have been set up under the Act to consider the applications of men for postponement of theirliability for service on the grounds of exceptional hardship, are now atwork and the latest figures show that 1,384 applications have been heard ofwhich 826 have been granted and 558 rejected.39.     The most recent analysis of the results of the sittings of theLocal Tribunals shows that 4,338 applications have been heard of which 639or 15 per cent have been granted unconditionally and 751 or 17 per centrejected.     Of the remainder, 1,958 men or 45 per cent of the total have been registered as conscientious objectors conditional on their undertaking certaincivil work specified by the Tribunals, and 990 or 23 per cent of the totalregistered for service in the Forces but of a non-combatant nature only.The Appellate Tribunal for England and Wales has so far sat on six day3 and atotal of 131 appeals have been considered.     In 93 cases the appeal has beendismissed while in 38 cases the decision of the Local Tribunals has been revised.     The Appellate Tribunal for Scotland has held its first meeting andthe most recent figures show that 28 cases have been heard.     In 8 cases thedecision of the Local Tribunals was varied, while in 19 cases the decisionffas upheld, and one case has been adjourned.SCHEDULE OF RESERVED OCCUPATIONS.Of the amendments made the most noteworthy was perhaps the removalthe Schedule of the occupations of Architect and Architectural DraughtsmanAllowing representations by the professional associations concerned that can^r members were not finding employment in their profession and were anxioust0 Join the Forces.

41.     Discussions with the Flour Milling industry regarding the essentialoccupations in this industry have led to the inclusion in the Schedule ofthe precise occupational description of each class of workman whom it is desired to reserve, in place of a general entry.42o     Following discussions with the Service Departments as to the types of men required in the Armed Forces in their trade capacity, amendments arebeing made to the list of civilian occupations from which such men may bedrawn.43.     Arrangements have been made for the temporary deferment of the calling-up under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act of workpeople inthe occupations most important to the principal firms engaged on vital workfor Government Departments.44.     Machinery has been brought into operation for the consideration of applications made by these or other employers, and supported by theGovernment Departments concerned, for the temporary deferment of the calling-up of individual key workpeople.45.     Arrangements have been made with the Ministry of Agriculture for theconsideration, in the first place, by Oounty War Agricultural Committees., of applications by farmers for the postponement of the calling-up under theNational Service (Armed Forces) Act of key workers in agriculture.46.     Arrangements have also been made with the War Office for the examination of the civilian occupations of men serving in Anti-Aircraft andCoast Defence Units of the Territorial Army and in the Home Defence Battalionswith a view to ensuring that men belonging to occupations which corresponds to Army trades are employed in the Army in those trades, and that menbelonging to the most important occupations which do not correspond to Armytrades, should, if they are of, or above, the ages of reservation for their occupation, be released to industry if this is possible having regard tooperational considerations.Partial relaxation of the Schedule for volunteers from certainoccupations.47.     The operation of the Schedule has been relaxed in order to permitaen of, or above, the age of reservation in certain occupations not of vital12.

importance which have an age of reservation of 30 years, to volunteer for service in H.M. Forces, including the &quot;Home Defence Battalions&quot; and the&quot;pioneer Corps&quot;, or in the Civil Defence Services.48.     In addition, a further relaxation of the Schedule has been made inorder to permit the recruitment in their trade capacity, irrespective ofthe ages of reservation, of a number of tradesmen, chiefly building androadmaking operatives, cooks, dockers and heavy lorry drivers, to meeturgent needs of H.M. Forces, especially the Army, for these classes oftradesmen.     In some of these occupations the relaxation of the Schedulecay be of temporary duration until the requisite numbers are recruited.49.    The relaxation of the Schedule extends also to the enrolment ofcertain classes of building operatives for full time duties in the A.R.P.Rescue Party Service.PROVISION FOR THE UNFJtPLOYED AND FOR RELIEF OF DISTRESS.50.     The number of cases in which allowances were authorised or underconsideration was as follows: -UNEI^PLOHvIENT ASSISTANCE(including supplementary allowances to claimantsfor unemployment insurance benefit) .22nd December, 1939.393,000	399,0004,700 26,500	4,400 26,500                !29th December, 1939PREVENTION AND relief of DISTRESS.(i) Evacuated Persons(ii) Other cases(Intld.)
