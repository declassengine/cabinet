There has been a deficit ofcoal of about 400,000 to 500,000 tons a month.The immediate difficulties, however, are aggravated by thesnow and frost of the last few weeks, which have gravelyrfer&amp;d with the movement of coal by rail.      This has stultifiedarrangements to blocks good by rail some of the deficit by sealoa, it has b&amp;en impossible lately for the railways to deliverthe normal quantities of railborne coal.The weather has affected deliveries not only to London butto places in the near neighbourhood of collieries,Birmingham, Nottingham, Glasgow, Manchester and many others.The Ministry of Shipping have undertaken to try to findFt snips to bring coal to London and the South, the Ministry ofpt-ort are fully alive to the seriousness of the. position and the&apos;&quot;ai&apos;s are doing all they can to alleviate it.      The Ministry ofA-ort have been asked to issue additional petrol to enable coalought by lorries over short distances where a shortage- relieved by this means,    but even this plan is handicappedb&quot;ai,e of &quot;the roads in many parts.
