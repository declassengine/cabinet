The deliveries of the former totalled02 3,7 inch and 4 = 5 inch complete equipments during the month..Additional schemes have been approved during the month for new capacity for the manufacture of shell, cartridge cases,fuzes, instruments and gun carriages.Orders Abroad.(a) Canada and the United States of America.A number of orders have now been placed by the mission in Canada, and enquiry is being made as to whether fillingcapacity is, or can be made, available in Canada for the ammunition components which have been ordered in that country.Quotations have been obtained for the supply of pistolsfrom the United States of America and are at present underconsideration.(b) India.Discussions have taken place with a representative ofthe Government of India and the India Office, as a result ofwhich further orders for shell and explosives have been placed to take up the whole of the output of&quot; the Indian OrdnanceFactories which is surplus to the Government of India&apos;s own needs.Royal Ordnance Factories^The building work at Chorley to provide for fillingUOmm. ammunition is expected to be completed by the end 01January, and production should commence in March.    It is aisoexpected that the building work for the additional capacity forUOrnn. filling at Bridgend and Glascoed will be completed by tneend of May.    Satisfactory progress is being made with tneconstruction work for the new filling factories at Swynnertonand Warring ton, and the building contract has been placed tor&quot;he third new factory, which is being located at Kirkby, nearLiverpool.   A possible site for the fourth new factory is beingsurveyed.

Sources of supply in addition to theHcyal Small Arms Factory have already been provided in Canadaend with a group of firms working with Monotype Ltd.    Thelatter scheme can be increased, and proposals are being submitted for financial approval for the incorporation of plant for alternative Bren gun manufacture in one of the new riflefactories referred to above.    On this basis upwards of half thetotal capacity will be outside Enfield.Small Arms Ammunition.In order to accelerate production, approval has beengiven to certain relaxations of the hours of employment ofwomen, and boys over 16 years of age, engaged in the making ofsmall arms ammunition.    Approval has been given for threefurther factories for the production of small arms ammunitionin addition to the two factories in course of construction atRadway Green and Standish.Machine Tools.An advisory committee has been formed of members ofthe trade representing interests in the manufacture of Digs,tools, fixtures and gauges, and a sub-committee has been set upto deal specifically with the question of plug, ring and screwgauges.   An inter-departmental committee has also been set upto co-ordinate requirements.*The number of assisted schemes for the expansion of machine tool production is now over l+O, and on these schemesexpenditure to date is about  800,000,    The number of types of machines has been reduced and this will secure increased production.   An &quot;over-riding&quot; order has been placed for anumber of simplified horizontal milling machines, from which-11 unnecessary refinements have been eliminated, rendering the machines suitable for production by firms not normally engagediri the machine tool industry.

Nottingham Embroidery Manufacturers&apos; Association and the , 22 0Association have promised their co-operation.Yin^n Thread &amp; Sewing Cotton.In view of the flax situation, it has been suggested*o the three Services and the Home Office that sewing cottonshould be substituted for linen thread, wherever possible.The War Office have already agreed to this substitution.Steel Helmets.The purchase in future of completed helmets instead of by components is under consideration.    This seems likely to achieve both a reduction in cost and a speeding up ofproduction.26,  Hosiery.Further large demands for the Army have been received,and additional manufacturing capacity in this country is being sought.   The Admiralty and Air Ministry have agreed to placetheir estimated requirements before the Ministry so that the planning of production for the three Services may be undertakensimultaneously, on the basis of fixed prices to be determinedby agreed costings for the several manufacturing districts.J*7,   Leather Laces.Demands have been received for approximately Ik millionpairs and contracts for 9,995,962 pairs have been placed.   as there is little likelihood of suitable kips being, available insufficient quantity to meet the outstanding demand by the required date - May, 19u1 - the question of supplying speciallytreated cotton laces as an alternative is being explored.jj8,  Allied Demands.(a) Greek.In response to an enquiry the Greek Government havebeen supplied with on estimate of the price of leathersufficient for 100,000 pairs of boots. (The Greek Governmentwere also informed that the leather required to make 11,000Sam Browne belts would cost approximately  6,000,).(b) Polish.As a result of a meeting held on the 8th December,1939, between representatives of the Polish Government and theMinistry, it was agreed that the Ministry should take over thestock of leather now held by the Poles and that the latter should be supplied in due course with boots to the value of theleather.(c) French.(l) Trench Boots.

Enquiries were pursued during the month withlew to supplying jerseys and Balaclava helmets for the French.Vv samples were submitted to the French, but it was found possible to guarantee delivery in time.tii) Boots.    The French have again raised the question of furtherltoolies of boots and have asked the War Office whether theyav have the 150,000 pairs previously offered to them but not&apos;c-epted.    In the present situation, however,  the War Officevnve been obliged to refuse this request.    Orders were placed^^38,600 pairs for delivery by 15th February, 1940, at lk/Sd.tier pair maximum price.    Efforts are being made to place further orders for them to meet their demand for 100,000 by 15th February,lcjkO.   The fact that they keep the price limit so follow makes it very&quot;unlikely that they will receive the full amount.(e) Ground Sheets.    The French are pressing for a million groundsheets, of which they have been allowed half a million by theWar Office, plus 20,000 from contract.    The position in regardto the remainder is under examination.(6) Leather.    Contracts have been placed with British tanners forroughly 1,252,000 feet of upper leather for the French. Thiswas urgently required and some of it has already been shipped.The French have waived inspection in view of the urgency, andhave agreed in the special circumstances to pay direct.(7) Web Anklets &amp; Web Equipment.   A very urgent demand for1,000,000 square metres of material has been received.    TheWar Office were prepared to release a million anklets from stock,but it was found that our anklets are too short for the Frenchand accordingly the equivalent material for 100,000 pairs willbe supplied as and when available.    It has been agreed to release 20,000 yards of pack webbing now in store at manchester and a sample anklet made from this material has been submittedto the French.   A large quantity of leather for leggings hasbeen offered as a substitute.A demand for 100,000 sets of v/eb equipment or the equivalent materials is under consideration, but it is unlikelythat the demand will be met.(a) Belgian.A demand received from Belgium for 10,000 pairs of rubber trench boots has been met by the War Office from stock. ,(e) Finnish.A large list of heterogeneous demands has been receivedirom Finland and is under discussion with the War Office.B.

It has been agreed, after discussion with the Chief Inspector of Stores, to take anumber of tin plate items in a lighter gauge.Similarly, with a view to easing the steel position, ithas been agreed to accept a number of articles in iron -wrought or cast.Kraft-Board.The difficulty of obtaining adequate quantities ofKraft and Chip board for packing purposes has increased duringthe months    The Treasury have approved the importation of5,000 tons and are likely to approve a further 5,000.    Onlyone firm in this country produces Kraft board and Kraft linerand pending an extension of their capacity (which is in hand)they will probably have to import some 30,000 tons.Horse Shoes.A meeting took place with 30 representatives ofbuilders and iron merchants who could organise the productionof horse shoes by rural smiths and with whom the Ministrycould place contracts.    Owing to some alteration in the quantities required by the Army authorities, delay has occurred in bringing the rural scheme to fruition.&apos;  1&apos;0&apos;A.

vj ssen Huts.Contracts have been placed for the differentcomponents for 7,500 huts.. These components are delivered toDonnington, where arrangements are made for consigning them to france  in appropriate quantities for proper erection in situ.Since the assembly in correct quantities of the differentsmall components could not be undertaken at Donnington, a contract was arranged with a firm of packers.PART .IV^^PJ^MTERLALS.The outstanding feature of raw material questionsduring the month has been the continued impossibility ofproviding in full for all shipping requirements.    In somecases, as a result,, imports have not been equal to consumption,nnd the question of restricting less important uses in orderto conserve such stocks as exist has come to the fore.    Thesame general conclusion is also indicated by foreign exchangeconsideration, but in many cases economies in shipping byshort hauls,  and in foreign exchange by purchase in easiercurrencies, pull in ippposite directions.Iron and Steel.Steel production in October and November averaged just over 13i million tons and this rate was maintained in December.This is above the 13 million tons rate estimated for the first year of the war.   Consumption of iron ore is still exceedingsupplies owing to the shipping difficulty in relation to imports, but home production has rapidly expanded and inDecember reached l\ million tons per annum above the previouspeak level in 1937.    Every effort is being made to overcome the shipping difficulties and to improve the supply of importedore.Discussions have taken place with the French on thejoint steel requirements of the two countries.   An agreement has been reached under which supplies from Belgium (based on french ores) and Prance of semi-finished steel will continueto reach here in return for increased supplies of metallurgicalcoke from this country.    This arrangement will enable France toincrease her production; she will receive assistance on specialquality steel from this country.aluminium.Considerable progress has been made with the greaterutilisation of scrap and the substitution of other materials and the Central Priority Committee have now agreed to adefinite allocation of the available supplies for the nextyear.    Looking to the expanding future demand, discussions are proceeding for increasing the production in this country, andthe Aluminium Controller is in Canada discussing theprobabilities of increased production in that country.Non-ferrous Metals.Supplies of metals are coming forward in sufficient quantities to meet demands, but it has not yet been possible tobuild up any substantial reserves,    At a meeting of theJoint Production and Materials Priority Sub-Committee it wasdecided that there was no need at present to place any restriction on demands for Government purposes of lead and2inc.
