(R) (39) 118)I.    general there is little I can add under this head to my last;eport.   The celebration of 22nd December as a &quot;deliveranceay&quot; from the Congress Ministries, which had been urgedjpon his co-religionists by Mr. Jinnah, president of them-India Muslim League, was held throughout India,fortunately without giving occasion for disturbance oritrouble anywhere.    I have had as yet no detailed reports,out I imagine that the meetings to pass the prescribedresolution were held privately, probably for the most partin mosques, and without public demonstrations.On the same date the All-India Congress Committee putout yet one more manifesto, taking as their text the observations I had made in the House of Lords on the dayParliament adjourned as to the essential necessity as thefirst step towards any further constitutional progress in-ndia for a concordat between Hindus and Muslims, or ratherfor the abandonment of the present universal attitude ofviewing every question primarily from its&apos; communal aspect.-n&apos;9 Committee&apos;^ manifesto professed as before to regardTerence to the communal problem as clouding the issue and-:S a device of the British Government for sidetracking the

The meetings ofother political organisations which are customarily heldin Christmas week were made the occasion for repetitionby such bodies as the National Liberal Federation and theIndian Christians&apos; organisation of their view thatunconditional support ought to be given to the Governmentof India in their prosecution of the war.The position accordingly remains one in which theCongress are evidently somewhat at a loss as to what is tobe the next move.   But I interpret such signs as areavailable to me of the inner workings of the minds of leading politicians as indicating that there is a growingrecognition of the obvious truth which the Congress Part,probably to some extent failed to realise, and when theyold realise it endeavoured to blink, that the minoritiesview with great uneasiness and distrust the prospect of responsible Parliamentary government, and that there is nonope of peaceful acceptance by them of any further radical changes in the form of government in India unless, as theresult of mutual consultation and agreement, the minor-ities.&apos; fears can be removed and their agreement secured.A&quot;t the same time there appears to me to persist in theroinds of each party to the controversy the curious beliefVnat it is not beyond the power of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and Parliament to coerce the other party into CQUiescence in constitutional conditions which that party:,oes not generally accept as either reasonable ornecessary.
