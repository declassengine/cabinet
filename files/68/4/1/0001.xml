ThisFlotilla is expected to complete during December when the last two of theseDestroyers are due to finish.It has been decided that, with a view to preventing any retardationof completion dates, the Cruisers DIDO and PHOEBE shall go on service withoutthe last 5.25&quot; gun mounting.The possibility of bringing out the &quot;L&quot; Class Destroyers with twogun mountings only is under consideration.     This would not only prevent the&quot;L&quot; Class being retarded but should enable the &quot;M&quot;   Class Destroyers to becompleted on time with all three mountings.In view of the special need for Escort Vessels for anti-submarineduties, to relieve Destroyers, efforts are being made to accelerate the firstships of the HUNT Class, and the completion dates of six of these ships havebeen brought forward by periods varying from one to four months.A number of small vessels now under construction will begin toleave the builders&apos; yards in a few months&apos; time and consideration is being given to the follow-on orders that should be placed.      Owing to the enemy&apos;policy of mine and submarine warfare, the need for large numbers of smallvessels is acute, and proposals are under consideration to order, in thefirst/

first instance, a further -16   Past Escort Vessels10   Boom Defence Vessels12   Minesweepers12   Trawlers fitted for both A/S and M/S work20   Patrol Vessels of the Whale Catcher typeThe estimated cost of these ships is  11,820,000 hut the Turkish government desire to purchase seven Boom Defence vessels in this country under theagreement recently concluded, and it is proposed to furnish these sevenvessels out of either the ten included above or those air: ady under construction for the Admiralty, as may be most convenient.Proposals are also under consideration for the building of a newmonitor with twin 15&quot; mountings from MARSHAL   SOULT and for the armouring ofEREBUS and TERROR.Work in H.M. Dockyards continues in accordance with the prioritygiven to specific ships by the Board.     The number of ships in hand excludingtrawlers and small craft generally, now exceeds 100, and the volume of workin connection with the refit and repair of these is steadily increasing.The resources of private yards are being increasingly used to supplement the Naval Dockyards and there are at present 27 ships in hand for repairswith outside firms.The constant pressure of work on ships of high priority, such asvessels taken in hand for conversion in connection with measures forcounteracting the menace of the magnetic mines, continues, with consequentdelay in some long dated, ships, such as QUEEN ELIZABETH, SIRIUS and probablyTRINIDAD.     As stated in the last report, the amount of delay will depend onthe amount of higher priority which the Dockyards may be called upon tocarry out.The reconstruction of the VALIANT which has been in progress for nearly 3 years was completed on the 25th November,  (excluding sea trials).The ship is to proceed to Bermuda for working up and such trials as are possible prior to joining the Home Fleet.It/

It has been decided that ROYAL SOVEREIGN shall complete her refitimpair without re -armouring so that her anticipated completion date willpStne 23rd December, 1939.AUXILIARY :;AR VESSELS ,JtD R.?.A&apos;s.The number of ships under requisition or on charter at the end ofNovember was 1522, an increase of about 300 during the month.    The increase is mainly due to the decision to requisition further vessels for magneticmine sweeping.      200 trawlers and 100 drifters are to be taken up for thisjgurpose, of which all the drifters and 100 of the trawlers arc to be fitted with magnetic or electric sweeps, while the other 100 trawlers will beHRloyed on trawling for the mines.     By the end of November 94 of the driftersend 175 of the 200 trawlers had been taken up.     An increased number ofvessels for Boom working and harbour defence is also included in the total.Satisfactory progress is being made in the fitting out of such these ships as need conversion.     The main points are:-(1)    A.M. C&apos;s.     All the 15 for emergency fitting have been completed(including the RAWALPINDI, since sunk);    16 with semi-completefitting have been finished and 19 others are in hand, 5 of whichshould complete early in December.(2)    Minesweepers.     100 of the original 200 trawlers have been fullyfitted, while 51 more are in hand;    22 paddle boats have beencompleted, with 11 in hand, and 52 of the drifters recentlyrequisitioned are also in hand.(3)      Anti-submarine service.       45 of the requisitioned trawlers are complete (in addition to 75 of the 78 purchased /) while 28 arein hand;     29 yachts have completed and 3 are in hand.1CHASE OF VESSELS ABROAD.In order to help to meet the urgent need for minesweepers seven tugsve been purchased abroad (including six from Belgium) at a cost which istimated at about  88,000.A salvage vessel has also been purchased in Holland at a cost of out  10,500.D.E.M.S./Excluding 8 sold to Prance.

The defensive &quot;arming of lie reliant Ships is now progressingsatisfactorily in all areas.    The number armed, exclusive of requisitionedships, had risen to 1130 by the end of November, an increase of over 4-00during the month.   Of these 752 had been aimed with 1 gun, 376 with 2 gunsand 2 with 3 guns, and 137 had been fitted with paravanes.DOCKING- POSITION.Work is proceeding on all the items mentioned in the last Report.The Sabang Floating dock arrived at Singapore on the 28th November.    It isanticipated that the Southampton Floating Dock will be towed to Portsmouthin mid-January, 1940.    The berth is now ready.Tyne and Dundee - Submarine Refitting Bases.     Consequent upon the increased number of submarines operating in Home Waters, arrangements are now proceedingfor the provision of facilities for docking and repairing some of these vessels at commercial yards on the North East coast.DAI AGE FROM ENEMY ACTION.The Minelayer ADVENTURE was mined on the 13th November and has beendocked at Chatham.   After temporary repairs, requiring 3 - h- weeks,  the vessel will be moved to Devonport for final repairs which will take several months.The Cruiser BELFAST, damaged by enemy action on ,the 21st November,is now in dock at Rosyth for temporary repairs which will take some weeks.After the completion of these the vessel will be moved elsewhere for finalrepairs, the extent of which will be considerable.RESCUE AND SALVAGE WORK.(a)   Rescue Tug Service.The organisation for providing Rescue Tugs has continued on thelines indicated in the last report.    There are nov/ eleven Rescue Tugs ofwhich six are commissioned and armed.    One other tub has been requisitionedbut is temporarily detached for heavy coastal towages.    The arrangementsfor working with commercial tug owners are continuing, but the majority ofthe tugs available under these conditions are not suitable for work at seaunder winter conditions, and the financial results are proving discouragingto the owners.Weather conditions, combined with the enemy&apos;s mining campaign, have resulted/

resulted in a heavy increase in calls for assistance.    Tugs have beensent out on 22 oocasions, successfully on eight.Arrangements for obtaining close co-operation with the FrenchRescue Tug Section are making good progress and it is hoped to promulgatethese very shortly.An important factor compared with 1 914--1 918 is that the averageMerchant Ship is now-a-days much larger with the result that more Tug Powerwhen rendering assistance is essential,,    It is already evident that a consider-able number of additional Rescue Tugs will be required and proposals to thisend are under consideration,(b)   Salvage Service.The development   of this service is following the course outlined in the last report.   Delivery of pumps, air compressors and other salvageplant has commenced, and some of the new plant has already been used insalvage operations.The two salvage ships acquired abroad have not yet reached theUnited Kingdom.    The three other suitable ships requisitioned have commencedtheir refit; and a vessel released by the Air Ministry has been requisitionedfor conversion.    Two old lifting barges are being reconditioned and earlydelivery is expected of a dumb salvage lighter that has been purchasedabroad.    (The salvage vessel referred to earlier under. &quot;Purchase of VesselsAbroad).IIEQUIPMENT AND WARLIKE STORES.GUN MOUNTINGS.After three months of war it is unfortunately now clear thatacceleration in the output from the highly specialised gun mounting and fire control factories of the principal armament firms has not been achievedunder v;ar conditions.    The failure to obtain the desired increased rate ofproduction is due to:-1.     The deficiencies in labour existing in the principal armamentfactories prior to the war, which it has not proved possible toremove by the bringing in of skilled men,2.     The serious loss from industry of keymen, skilled and semi-skilled labour to the Armed Forces.These factors are dealt with more fully in Section IV of this report.

Satisfactory/In consequence the hoped for acceleration in thecompletion of the gun mountings for the more powerful warshipsmay not be achieved, but it depends upon the rate of trainingof the unskilled men.PROVISION 0? ADDITIONAL APjjAMENT CAPACITY.Satisfactory progress is being made with the various schemes in hand for the provision of additional armament capacityThe main proposals approved during the month are asfollows:-(l)   Equipment for Merchant Vessels and Auxiliaries.(a) Q.F. 12 pdr. gun bodies.    The full annual output will be some 500 gun bodies.(b) 4&quot; L.A. and 4&quot; Q.P. gun bodies.    The full annual output will be some 290 g\ins.It is anticipated that both these projects will be in productionin twelve to fifteen months subject to the availability of machine tools.     The existing capacity is sufficient to meetthe associated requirements of mountings.(2)   A. A. Ammunition.The additional capacity will provide an increase of something like 50fo on the general basis of provision of ammunition ofthis type.A proposal is at present under consideration toprovide a factory for the manufacture of Oerlikon guns inthis country.GUNS AND AMMUNITION, ETC.t The extent of orders to be placed during the first year of war to meet war expenditure of ammunition, torpedoes,mines,-etc. and to provide equipments for additional new construction or vessels taken up, has been reviewed in the lightof the various new factors involved (e.g. equipments for additional auxiliary vessels, including 2,500 Oerlikon guns;and mines required for operation S.N,) and is now in excess of 50,000,000, excluding orders on books at the outbreak of war.

- 7 -Satisfactory progress has &quot;been made with theproduction of the first equipment of ammunition for the new ships referred to above; and the quantities of ammunition andtorpedoes expended on active service have been relatively small.Planning is in hand for accelerating the output of mines to meet the requirements of the S.N.scheme.Production of depth charges is increasing and isat present just keeping pace with expenditure.     Satisfactory-progress is being made with the production of Torpedo Tubes,Depth Charge Release gear and Mine Laying gear.Supply of ammunition outfits is now being made atcommercial ports to new warships built at contractors&apos; yards,thus avoiding the necessity for the ships to proceed to aDockyard port for completion.Proposals are under consideration for the transferof certain ammunition reserves now in freight ships to temporaryexplosive storage ashore or to hulks or lighters, with a viewto release of seagoing tonnage.Arrangements are being made for the production inAustralia of 2 pdr. ammunition and depth charges to the extentof 9 per cent and 5 per cent respectively of our first year&apos;s requirements.     The order for 2 pdr. ammunition is additional to the maximum home capacity and will result in a gain of 12months.     There will be no gain in time as regards depth chargesbut a source of supply will be developed in Australia as an insurance against loss of capacity here.AiiTi-ivui.G-i&apos;]ETic mine devices.Counter measures to magnetic mines continue to be developed intensively.     In addition to the conversion of specialships and an aeroplane, and to the requisitioning of the trawlers and drifters already mentioned, trials and production of specialmagnetic and electric sweeps are being pressed forward./Additional

ADDITIONAL BOOM DEFENCE MATERIAL.In continuation of the steps taken to provide adequateboom defences it has been decided to order additional booms and netsfor the provision of boom defences at new bases and of increasedprotection at existing bases.     The expenditure involved iuabout  1,700,000.FLEET AIR ABM AIRCRAFT.The number of Aircraft in First Line Squadrons on the1st December was 211 and the number employed on Training and ancillary Services was 238.     These figures compare with 220 and189 respectively on the 1st November.     The decrease in the numberof aircraft shown in First Line Squadrons is temporary being inthe main due to losses of aircraft from ships remote from theirbase at the time of rendering this report.     The situation willadjust itself when replacement aircraft are embarked, and thenumber of First Line Initial Equipment will increase with theformation of the new Squadrons now under discussion.Reserves of Serviceable Aircraft have increased from353 to 393 during the month, while unserviceable Aircraft (invarious states of unreadiness)^have decreased from 364 to 348.These figures include aircraft loaned for special training purposes by the Air Ministry and oivil types requisitionedon behalf of the Admiralty.FLEET AIR ARM STORES AND SPARES.Shortages of certain classes of stores continue to cause anxiety and energetic action is being taken with the AirMinistry to hasten delivery.III.MATERIALS.The supply of raw materials, semi-manufactured goodsetc. continues to be reasonably satisfactory with certain exceptions.     Machine Tools, Aluminium, Flax, Hemp Copper and timber are in short supply, but every effort is being made   throughthe appropriate machinery, to meet essential requirements.-------------------------.__________________________.__.IVZ____________________ihese figures include (i) Aircraft undergoing or due for repairs andoverhaul;    (ii) Aircraft for which full operation equipment is notavailable;    and (iii) air frames without engines.

- 9 -IV.LABOUR.The position in regard to the production ofnaval material has been reviewed in the light of theexperience of the first three months of war.      It isnow obvious that the hoped for acceleration over peacetime production has not been obtained in many directionsand notably in regard to those items of special material,e.g., gun mountings and fire control gear, to the import-ance of which attention has been drawn in previous reports.This review has disclosed the fact that these difficulties are very largely due to labour shortage arising in themain from the necessity to complete a programme of product-ion which exoeeded any other previously undertaken in peace or war.     As the full strain of war production has not yetbeen felt, the position clearly calls for close attention.One of the basic difficulties of the situation is ofcourse that rearmament started after many years of disarma-ment and unemployment in the shipbuilding industry, duringwhich men drifted away in large numbers.     As a resultdifficulties with labour supply were being experienced bythe armament firms as far back as last April.The mobilization of the Territorials and the calling up of Reservists on the outbreak of war inevitablyadded to the labour difficulties of armament firms.     the potential loss of these men had, of course, been realisedby firms but it is doubtful whether they had guarded against it/

its incidence by adequate training of substitutes.A temporary mitigation of the position was secured in the case of the Reservists by the granting of 3months exemption to some 850 key men.     The period of exemption has now expired and these men have been called up.As regards the Territorials a scheme forcombing out skilled men was instituted but only asmall proportion of losses have been made good in thisway.     Several thousands of applications were made inrespect of skilled men to the War Office but in thegreat majority of cases the conditions of the comb-outwere not satisfied.     It was hardly possible to expect that the Territorial Army should thus seriously bereduced in its efficiency by being deprived of a largenumber of experienced men.Par more serious was the prospect of losingskilled and semi-skilled men as successive age groups wereproclaimed registered and called up.     Fortunately this danger has been averted by a valuable agreement recentlyreached, under which there is secured the indefinite post-ponement of the calling up of men from 24 of the Admiralty&apos;main contractors and from the Naval Establishments, andpostponement, for the time being at all events, of the calling upof men from another 400 contractors of importance to theAdmiralty.     Nevertheless it is too much to hope that even with these precautions, the successive calling up of theage groups will not produce marked deleterious results on theprovision of essential supplies for the Admiralty.     Thatthis can hardly fail to be so is illustrated by the fact that,apart from the firms mentioned above, there remain some,000 firms engaged on Admiralty work.As/

As a result of the shortage existing at the beginning,i itensified by the drain&apos; for the Army, it has not proved possible to obtainany increase in production in those highly specialised forms of equipmenton which the date of completion of ships is primarily dependent.Consequently, as pointed out in Section II, the hoped for acceleration:m the completion of the more powerful warships will not be achievedexcept by the drastic cutting of trial programmes, the elimination ofthe normal period provided for opening up and adjusting the machinery of warships after trials, and the sending of them on service in certaininstances with incomplete equipment.When a forward view is taken it cannot be denied that the position(gives some cause for anxiety.     All three Services are very much more highly mechanised than in the last war with proportionately greaterdemands for skilled men, both for the production and also the maintenanceon service of the necessary equipment.     Their competing requirements,*hich existing resources are inadequate to meet, will grow rapidly withdevelopment of the war effort.      One example of this growth isrovided by the enormous programme of new factories to be put up atrovm expense running into tens of millions of pounds since theeginning of the war, the operation of which, when built, will make4reat demands on the supply of skilled labour.To some extent armament firms have been able to increase their labour supply by recruitment from firms mainly engaged on non-armamentvork whose activities were curtailed by war conditions.     Moreover,dilution which is proveeding, although not at an even rate in alldistricts, will help, and the firms drawing attention to the effect of theirsnortage of skilled engineering labour on the completion of Admiraltycontracts arc reminded of the existence of&apos; the. dilution agreement!    Thessistance.which dilution can render, however, is limited.     Certain firms-ave assessed the help to be afforded by it at some 29 to 30 per cent.This/

- Progress of work generally has been affected by the bad weather conditions normally expected during November, and the state of the ground hasslowed up constructional work on runways at Fleet Air Arm Establishments,Bunds (dams) at Oil Fuel Depots, etc.The/This will in part he absorbed by making good as far as is possible bydilutees the loss of skilled men to the Armed Forces and there is noquestion that if the desired war production is to be achieved some further large -positive increase will be necessary.A better disposition of the available resources by utilising smallfirms more effectively may help, and this matter is being investigated.But in many instances, for example, with anti-submarine materiel, littlesuccess is being experienced.      Such a measure, moreover, will not help tomeet the requirements of the existing Admiralty constractors for a positive increase in the skilled labour forces under their direct control.-There are obviously limits to the extent to which the skilled man poweremployed upon production for the ordinary trade of the country can bedrawn upon.As things stand therefore, everything points to intensifiedcompetition in a limited market between the growing requirements of theServices.   Estimates will doubtless soqi be available of the additional requirements of labour as the result of the investigations of the Land ForcesStatistics Committee into the needs of the programmes of the three Services,and there is little room for doubt that these will disclose very seriousshortages.     The question of how they can be met and whether they can be met in time is obviously a matter calling for the most urgent attention since it is vital to our war effort.Lastly, it is of the greatest importance that all three services should restrict their requirements of highly skilled men to a minimum;this is probably being done.     Dilution must be accepted to the maximum extent and it is recommended that in each Service a small committee should be set upto investigate whether the various measures already in force for dilutionwithin the Services can, with safety, be further expanded.1&apos; -WORKS. .

Admiralty, S.W.1,The shortening hours of daylight are similarly affecting output and,wherever possible under A.R.P.  conditions, night work is being carried out;Rthougli in consequence of the bad weather and resultant conditions alreadyIntioned, it was temporarily abandoned at one F.A.A. establishment.has been found possible to work overtime in one establishment, onIrternal works in an important building nearing completion, by the fittingof dark blinds, but this expedient is necessarily restricted in itsplication.Gales have resulted in the demolition of certain buildings inDurse of erection intthe Orkneys, where also the visits of enemy aircrafte affecting progress.     These gales have also delayed transhipment ofaterials from the mainland and between working sites within the islands.Luring the month there have also been delays due to shortage ofaterials of various kinds, and in the case of urgent works the directsistance of the Ministry of Supply has been requested and obtained.      Inis connection it is desired to draw special attention to the shortage ofiber which has necessitated the adoption of alternative means ofnstruction, even on contracts under execution.It is anticipated that the P. A. A. Stations at Arbroath and Yeovilton,&quot;or completion in July, 1940, will be ready for partial use bych, 1940, and that the F.A.A.  station at Grail, due for completion intember, 1940, will be available for partial use by the previous April.VI.SUPPLIES TO OTHER COUNTRIES.Active steps are being taken to fulfil the Turkish requirementsgpnsisting of motor boats, submarine chasers, motor minesweepers, mines,depth charges and other armament stores to the value of  2,150,000, of which-,000,000 was included in the total given in the last report.Negotiations are proceeding with Portugal for the supply to them ofhree submarines at a total cost of  1,350,000.(Intd.)
