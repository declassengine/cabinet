Origin of theMeeting.Exchange ofGreetings.Public opinion in Great Britainarid France.German efforts to Divide theAllies.Great Britain&apos;sPreparations fora Long War.^Mobilisation ofIndustry inGreat Britainand France.THE First Meeting of the Supreme War Council was arranged in consequence of a telegram from the Prime Minister to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris, directing him to approachM. Daladier with the proposal that it would be advantageous nowto hold a meeting of the Council.A copy of the telegram in question is attached as Annex Ato this record.M. DALADIER, at the opening of the meeting, welcomed thePrime Minister and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.He said that Franco-British co-operation had never been stronger than it was to-day, and would be further strengthened by themeeting which was now taking place.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN thanked M. Daladier for his welcome,and said he was very glad to have this opportunity for an exchangeof views. He bad felt that it was undesirable to leave it too long before there was a direct and personal contact of this nature. Itwas essential that the solidarity of France and Great Britain shouldbe maintained and conveyed to the world.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that never before had there beensuch a unity of opinion in the United Kingdom as existed to-day.There was not a single note of criticism to be heard, and all agreedthat no other course of action had been possible than that which hadbeen taken by France and Great Britain together.M. DALADIER was glad to say that there was exactly thesame feeling in France. There had never been such unity of will.French opinion was unanimous that Herr Hitler, and all he stoodfor, must be disposed of. Until this had been achieved there couldbe no prospect of normal life in Europe.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN expressed his pleasure at this assurance.The Allies were not fighting just for a Corridor or a town, but forthe right to live in peace and quiet without a constant menace fromone single: source. He felt that this should be made clear to theworld, particularly as one already heard of attempts to divideFrance and Great Britain. It must be made clear that the Alliescould not discuss peace except with a Government upon whose wordreliance could be placed, and which would accept our.ideas on howEurope should live.M. DALADIER agreed. He thought that Germany wouldmake even greater efforts to divide France and Great Britain. Thiswas evident from their wireless propaganda and from placardsdisplayed in the line to the effect that Germany desired the friendship of France. He added that French troops had nothesitated to fire on these placards.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN referred to the British Government^communique regarding their intention to make preparations for athree years&apos; war. This decision had been made even, beforeField-Marshal Goring&apos;s speech, which had only emphasised thenecessity for a pronouncement of this kind.It should not be taken to mean that the British Governmentnecessarily believed that the War would last three years, but merely as an indication of the scale and nature of the preparations whichit was proposed to pursue.M. DALADIER said that that was bow, the Britishcommunique had been interpreted in France.The British Government were taking immediate steps toincrease their efforts to an even greater extent than hitherto. Theii&apos;plans contemplated the mobilisation and direction of industry; the doubling of aircraft production; a vast expansion of the Army; andthe production of munitions not only for Great Britain but also for her Allies.
M. DALADIER said that France was making similar prepara-tions. An inventory had been taken of the country&apos;s resources; andit was proposed to establish a Ministry of Munitions with, as itsMinister, the present head of the State Railways.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN referred to the appointment ofMr. Burgin as the Minister of Supply, and the use the BritishGovernment were making of the services of important industrialists.He suggested the necessity for consultation with the French as tothe best use which could be made of their collective resources.M. DALADIER said that these questions were already under examination in London, and thought that this examination mightbe extended to cover the question of supplies from the United Statesof America. He expected an early revision of the Neutrality Law,and it was important to avoid any possibility of France and GreatBritain becoming rivals for American goods, as had been the case inthe earlier days of the last war.He added that France had already sent a Mission to the UnitedStates of America for the purchase of aircraft and that good resultshad been achieved.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN felt sure that the lessons of the last war had not been lost. In many ways a start was now being made wherethe last war had left off. He said that Mr. Winston Churchill, onjoining the War Cabinet, had remarked on the great improvementin the preparatory arrangements to-day as compared with thosewhich had existed in 1914.The General Mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked M. Daladier how the general military Military situation appeared to him.   Had it developed according toSituation. expectation or not %M. DALADIER said that it had developed exactly as had been anticipated, and hoped for, by the French General Staff. Thepresent situation was very different from that which had existed in1914. Germany had embarked on the conquest of Poland, whileendeavouring to maintain a static position in the west. The french military Forces were steadily and methodically approaching the siegfried Line. No spectacular success was anticipated, but it waspossible that the attack might develop into a large scale operation.The situation might have been very different if Belgium had not adopted neutrality from the outset.Internal Peeling Mr. CHAMBERLAIN referred to the internal position inin Germany.      Germany.   From the information at his disposal it appeared thatthe German people were not enthusiastic about the war in the west.It had been, as it were, amusing to indulge in hostilities with poland, but the testing time would come when Germany had tofight France and Great Britain.M. DALADIER agreed, and added that there were people inGermany who were not even aware that their country was at warwith France and Great Britain. For example, prisoners taken onthe Western Front had professed complete ignorance of the factthat Germany was at war with France.French Military        Mr. CHAMBERLAIN thought the decision not to undertakeOperations.        large-scale operations as yet in France had been wise.   In his view there was no hurry as time was on our side.   Moreover, the Alliesrequired time to build up their full resources, and in the meantimeit might well be that the morale of Germany would crumble.M. DALADIER was quite certain that large-scale offensive operations at the beginning would be an error. The situation wasnot the same as in 1914. He added that the French mobilisation hadbeen completed successfully and undisturbed.
j Mr. CHAMBERLAIN thought that Germany had missed agreat opportunity of disturbing this important stage of preparations.He asked whether General Gamelin was expecting heavy casualties from the operations in progress.GENERAL GAMELIN replied that he did notenvisagecasualties on a large scale. The object underlying the operationsnow in progress was to help Poland by distracting the attention ofGermany. His offensive was confined to activities in &quot; no man&apos;s&quot;land, and he had no intention of throwing his army against theGerman main defences. He had, in fact, issued specific orders for-bidding anything of the kind.In general the French aim was to cover all French territory, andto occupy such German territ would improve this general coverto France.As regards the employment of the Allied Air Forces he saidthat he was in agreement with the views expressed by the british air Staff that the Air Forces should not at present be used against objectives within Germany. Wastage would thus be avoided andthe danger of hitting non-military objectives, with its possible repercussions, obviated. The Poles desired the French to do more,but they felt that they were doing all they could.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN emphasised how completely he was inagreement with this policy. The whole question had only just been-examined by the British War Cabinet, and precisely the sameconclusion had been reached. It. was clear that nothing the Alliescould do would save Poland from being overrun. The despatch ofsuch war supplies as was possible would certainly encourage theirresistance, but the only real help to Poland lay in winning the war.It must be appreciated that at present France and Great britain were being left alone by Germany. The British factories were probably more vulnerable to air attack than those in Germany.Even if German air attacks were not particularly successful, therewas always the loss of time involved in air raid precautions. he felt that every week the country was left alone added to her reserves and to her anti-aircraft defensive strength. Again it must be re-membered that there was a lack of precision in bombing; and anextension of our present air policy would inevitably involve civilian casualties. This might have an unfortunate effect upon neutral opinion, particularly in the United States. If, however, theGermans began, there would, of course, be immediate retaliation.To summarise he said he felt that time was working for the Allies,and against Germany.M. DALADIER agreed on the question of air policy. At thesame time it was of importance to keep a Polish front in beingif possible. Almost all their sources of production had been destroyed, and it was most necessary to pass material throughRoumania into Poland. Even if this material reached Poland too late to help her, Roumania might well be the next to be attacked,and the material would then be of value to her.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN remarked on the difficulty of transport-ing supplies to Poland. There was only a single railway throughBucharest to the Polish frontier, dividing into two just beforecrossing the border, and much of the line was only single-track. Itwas true that there were roads as well, but these were in badcondition, and when the weather changed, as must be anticipated,they would serve little useful purpose. The easiest way to supplyPoland was through Odessa; but he was afraid that it was notpossible to count on this. He agreed in principle with thedesirability of doing everything possible to help, but was nothopeful that very much could be done.
Operations in poland.Germany&apos;military Inten-tions after theSubjugation ofPoland.German air policy.Attitudetowards Italy.M. DALADIER observed that it looked as if there had been some halt in the Polish retreat. It was possible that they might beable to hang on in the same manner as the Spanish Republicanforces had done in Madrid.GENERiAL GAMELIN thought it probable that the Germanmechanised forces had outstripped the infantry. He mentioned that he had telegraphed to Marshal Smigly-Rydz agreeing with thepolicy which was being pursued. It was to be hoped that thosedivisions of the Polish army which had been cut off by the German&quot; pincer&quot; movement would harass the German rear by guerillatactics.Me. CHAMBERLAIN said that the dry weather had been much against the Poles. He was advised that the Vistula wasfordable. A heavy fall of rain would probably slow up the german advance.LORD CHATFIELD asked whether General Gamelin contem-plated any change in his plan in the west, if Poland managed tohold out longer than had been originally envisaged.GENERAL GAMELIN said &quot; No.&quot; It would only give GreatBritain and France more valuable time- to prepare, and prevent theGermans from withdrawing forces from their Eastern to theirWestern front. It was not known whether they intended to do this,or to march on into Roumania.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked what was the French opinion asto the next German move after she had achieved success in poland and perhaps set up a Puppet Government in that territory.M. DALADIER said the possibility of a German advance intoRoumania could not be excluded since clearly Roumanian oil wouldbe an attraction. The attitude of Hungary would have to be takeninto account. At present it looked as though she would not be awilling partner. She had been upset by the German occupation ofSlovakia.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN thought that an advance into Roumaniawas the most probable next move. He could not see the Germanssitting down in front of the Maginot Line and accepting a stale-mate in the west. They must endeavour by some means or other toprovide spectacular successes for popular1 consumption.LORD CHATFIELD wondered what the Germans intended todo with the great air forces that they established in North-west germany. Were these to be used against England or France beforethe winter 1M. DALADIER thought it possible that the Germans mighttry to destroy the morale of the civil population in England andFrance.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN was doubtful whether Germany woulddeliberately embark on a plan of that kind. The Spanish war had proved that civilian morale cannot be destroyed by air attack, evenin places where there are no anti-aircraft defences and the attackerhad matters all his own way. In these circumstances he himself was inclined to think that the Germans would use their air strength inan attempt to destroy the Allied Air Forces and sources of production-tion, and that they might also bomb communications andconcentrations of troops. Such a policy would be the best from a strictly military point of view, and he thought that that was whythe Germans would adopt it.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that if the next German movewere to be an attack upon Roumania, what would be the positionHungary,   Yugoslavia,   Turkey,  Bulgaria  and,   inasregards
particular, Italy ? As M. Daladier probably knew, he had been inclose contact with Rome for some time, and the results had not been by a,ny means discouraging.M. DALADIER said that he had also had contacts. Therewas undoubted Italian displeasure at the Saltzburg interviews.Signor Mussolini was annoyed by the German initiative, taken without his concurrence, and by the Soviet-German Pact.He felt that from the military point of view it was very desirable that I ould remain neutral, and advocated the policyof treating her very carefully.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said this was a most important point,with which he was in complete agreement. As it appeared to him,Italian opinion was divided. On the one side there wasthe King, Count Ciano. Count Grandi and General Balbo,who were in favour of neutrality. On the other sidethere was Starace and Alfieri and others who inclined to the policyof supporting the Axis. Holding the balance between these twofactions stood Signor Mussolini. He must, however, be annoyedwith Heir Hitler&apos;s evident contempt and obvious lack of considera-tion for Italy. He had, moreover, the mortification of seeing Hitlergetting away with all the spoils, while he himself got nothing; andall the time he must have the uneasy feeling that the Italian people as a whole were against war, and particularly a war against Franceand Great Britain.In all these circumstances he (Mr. Chamberlain) felt that itwas not necessary to go exactly &quot; cap in hand &quot; to Mussolini. TheBritish Government were certainly taking pains to make it as easyas possible for Italy, but favours and bribes should not be proffered.It was not inconceivable that she might one day be on the Alliedside.M. DALADIER indicated his assent,Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that there were three points which ought to be mentioned.First and this was a minor one there was the danger of italian submarines being attacked in mistake for Germans.Consultations were in progress, and it looked as if this problem could be resolved without difficulty.Secondly : there was the more difficult question of tighteningup the blockade of Germany. Italy was a channel through which germany could obtain supplies, and it was therefore necessary totell Italy that she could import what she normally consumed, butnot more. It was a delicate matter, but a start had been made andthe prospects of an agreement were not discouraging. Italy wasnot resisting the principle but asked for generosity towards hermanufacturers.Later of course Germany might bring pressure to bear on Italy,and the situation would then become more difficult. But if the wayhad been properly prepared, this German pressure might onlyincrease Italian irritation against Germany.Supplies from M. DALADIER indicated agreement.   He said that FranceItaly. had also commenced commercial negotiations with Italy, and werein fact already giving orders to them for motors. No difficulties had arisen. It was also worth noting that Italy had actuallydelivered goods to Poland since the outbreak of hostilities.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that Great Britain was alsoexploring the question of what could be sold to, and bought from,Italy. For example, we might let them have coal in exchange forlemons, &amp;c. It was contemplated that we might in due course send representatives to Italy to investigate the question of the supplyof engines and other accessories. The British Air Staff did not,however, hold a very high opinion of Italian material.
M. DALADIER expressed soniG surprise  it this, and referredto the reputation of the Fiat industry.Policy in the Mr. CHAMBERLAIN then turned to the third consideration;Balkans. namely the Italian position vis-a-vis the Balkans, and the Alliedrelationship with the Balkan countries. Italy was undoubtedlynervous and suspicious of Turkey. It was for this reason that theBritish Government had resisted the inclusion in the draft of theproposed Anglo-Turkish Treaty of words which would convey theimpression that the Treaty was particularly directed against Italy.M. DALADIER expressed the view that this was the rightpolicy. Nevertheless, it was necessary for the Allies to ensure that turkey was with them.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN agreed, but observed that it was possibleto have Turkey with us without necessarily having Italy against us.Attitude of M. DALADIER thought that Bulgaria was inclined to orientBulgaria and     herself towards Italy, in the hope that with Italian and GermanYugoslavia.       support she might obtain an access to the sea and a part of theDobrudja.   At the same time Bulgarian opinion was divided; the democratic party (including the Peasant Party) and public opinionwere, he thought, against war with France and England.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN thought that the position in Yugoslaviahad definitely improved.M. DALADIER agreed : the Serb-Croat Agreement had produced an excellent effect in that country&apos;s standing towards theAllies. There was a traditional hostility to Italy amongst thesouthern Slavs, while on the other hand there was a part)&apos; in yugoslavia anxious for agreement with Italy. He believed thatthe Yugoslav Government did not trust Italy, and interpreted her present neutrality as a trap.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that British information was much the same. The foregoing led him to ask what General Weygand&apos;mission had in view.General M. DALADIER said that General Weygand was the Com-Weygand&apos;s mander designate of the French forces in Syria. He had recentlyMission. paid a visit of a friendly and military nature to Angora, but therewas nothing more than that behind it. If, however, the war spread to the Balkans, General Weygand&apos;s functions would be mostimportant.GENERAL GAMELIN added it was not intended thatGeneral Weygand&apos;s presence in the Near East should cause anychange in the agreed arrangements for Command in the middle east Area.Lord CHATFIELD referred to the Anglo-French Conversa-tion in London prior to the war. At that time thought had been directed towards a war with Italy and, consequently, towards a plan to assist Turkey. It was then understood that General Weygandwould probably be the Generalissimo in that part of the world. now the situation Avas changed and, with Italy neutral, it would be unfortunate if an impression were conveyed that we were forming a Balkan bloc against her.M. DALADIER agreed, but observed that the dispositionsundertaken by the French were only to meet the eventuality of Italy&quot; entering the ring.&quot;GENERAL GAMELIN made two points. First, that france had taken precautions on the Franco-Italian border, but had at thesame time assured Italy that those precautionary steps did not represent any aggressive intentions.
The Attitude of spain.The BritishField Force.The time factor.The submarine campaign.Secondly, on the Balkan front a study had been made as to what should be our dispositions, not only in the event of Italian interven-tion, but also in the event of a German advance through the Balkans.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN felt that it would be advisable to keepthese plans well in the background.M. DALADIER agreed.GENERAL GAMELIN added that France would continue to reinforce her troops in Syria just as Great Britain was bringingreinforcements to Egypt.M. DALADIER, in answer to a question by the PrimeMinister, said he was satisfied with the present attitude of Spain.He referred to a recent speech by the Cardinal Primate of Spain,which was very hostile towards Germany. He did not think that theSpanish Government wished to change their present neutral posi-tion. It was true that they were at present hand in glove with italy, but they also had considerable sympathy towards Poland withits strong Catholic element. He felt that on the whole they were likely to remain neutral.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN observed that the Spanish attitude onlyillustrated once again the stupidity of Germany in coming to terms with Russia.M. DALADIER said that none the less it perhaps would havebeen better if Russia had come in on the Allied side, and helpedPoland.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN expressed the personal view that russia was formidable within her own territory, but that she had little capacity for offensive operations outside Russia.M. DALADIER agreed, except in so far as Russia&apos;s air strength was concerned.GENERAL GAMELIN, in reply to a question by Mr.Chamberlain, said that the British Field Force was arriving inFrance exactly according to plan. So far as he knew there had been no hitch of any kind.LORD CHATFIELD said that it had^ been hoped that war might be postponed at any rate until next Spring, by which time we would have been far more fully prepared. Great efforts were now being made to equip the new armies, and to double our aircraft production; and, if there were a cessation of operations in the Westduring the winter, we would be in a far better position to co-operate with the French by the spring of next year.M. DALADIER said that the French were in much the same position. They had started a four-year plan in September 1936which aimed at results in September 1940. It had been possibleto accelerate certain parts of the programme by about six months;but even so the production of these items would not reach its peakuntil March of next year. It was for this reason that germany had preferred to go to war now, rather than wait till next March.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN outlined the position as regards the anti-submarine campaign. Heavy losses had been anticipatedduring the four or five weeks while our defences were still incom-plete, but the results so far had not been as bad as anticipated.He thought that the menace was being gradually got under control.M. DALADIER thought that this was a point of capitalimportance.
The Attack onWilhelmshaven,The Question ofa Fleet Action.Action in theBaltic.Arrangementsfor Franco-British Liaison.LORD CHATFIELD said that it had always been anticipatedthat the German Navy would break out on to the trade routes insteadof staying in harbour, as they had last time. It was somewhatof a surprise that they had not as yet done so.In reply to a question from M. Daladier, he said the air attackat Wilhelmshaven had resulted in two 500-lb. bombs being dropped on a German battle-cruiser. There was no certain information asto how much damage had been done, but the ship would probably have to be laid up for some time and there must have been casualties among the crew. It had been a very gallant performance on thepart of our air force.In reply to a further question from M. Daladier as to theprospects of a naval action, Lord Chatfield said that the germans had only five capital ships to our ten or twelve. It was, therefore,too much to hope that they would risk a fleet action. On the otherhand single ships might break out on to the trade routes, and ifthey did this, their fast ships would take a lot of hunting down.It was possible that they might attempt a &apos;&apos; tip and run &apos;&apos; raidagainst our coasts. For us to bombard the German coast would notbe a practicable military operation.Lord Chatfield, continuing, said that it was impossible to say anything definite at this stage regarding the possibilities of naval action in the Baltic. If we could destroy the German capital ships,it might be then, but not until then, advisable to take a risk withsome of our own. As regards submarine operations in the Baltic,he realised that during the last war one or two of our boats hadmanaged to slip in and, once in, to operate from Russian bases.With Russia neutral this could not, of course, be done, and theywrould have to return to England to refuel, &amp;c.M. DALADIER observed that successful naval action in theBaltic would create a very serious position for Germany by cutting off her iron ore from Sweden.LORD CHATFIELD said that the possibilities of such action would always be borne in mind&apos;.GENERAL GAMELIN, in reply to a question by the PrimeMinister, said that he was perfectly satisfied with the present arrangements for liaison between the Fi^ench and British Forces,and that these arrangements enabled decisions to be reached in the shortest possible time.At the conclusion of the meeting the wording of a communiquefor issue to the Press was discussed. A copy of the British version,issued after the return of the Prime Minister to London, is attached as Annex B.
JOANNEX A.Telegram from the Prime Minister to His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Ambassador in Paris.PLEASE arrange immediate interview with M. Daladier and inform himprivately that Prime Minister feels it would be advantageous and would havea good effect in the two countries as well as elsewhere if there were now to be ameeting of the Supreme War Council. He would propose therefore to come overto-morrow in order not so much to discuss specific questions, but to exchange views as to the present position and probable future developments, the intention being to show that the two Governments are in active consultation and that the jointmachinery (already in operation in various ways) is being brought into being at the top. For this purpose Prime Minister proposes to fly over to france to-morrow (Tuesday). Unfortunately, Air Ministry cannot, for technical reasons,fly him as far as Paris. Please therefore tell M. Daladier Prime Minister wouldbe glad to take advantage of his offer to meet him half way. The Prime minister would accordingly propose to arrive at Abbeville at 10 - 30 and will leave Abbevilleat about 17 - 30. This should give time for a meeting at say 11 - 00 and another in the afternoon. If M. Daladier is unable to come as far as Abbeville, themeeting could take place at, say, Amiens at 11-30, provided arrangements aremade for transport from Abbeville to Amiens. As there are no immediatestrategic questions to be considered, Chiefs of Staff will not attend. PrimeMinister will be accompanied by Lord Chatfield, and by General Ismay, CaptainClarke and a Private Secretary. Press communique will be issued after PrimeMinisters return to London. Until Prime Minister is back, secrecy is vital andgreat care must be taken to avoid leakage. Please impress this on M. Daladierand ask him to make all arrangements in strict secrecy, notifying only thosedirectly concerned. Aircraft bringing party will be Lockheed Electra Monoplanecamouflaged top and sides colour yellow underneath with red and blue circles on top and bottom of wings. Registration number G AEPR in small letters on tail.Please ask M. Daladier to have French Air Authorities informed and let us knowwhen flight is authorised. Please also arrange for party to be met at Abbeville,and for an Embassy interpreter to be at Prime Ministers disposal throughoutthe day.ANNEX B.Copy of the Communique issued to the British Press subsequent to the return ofthe Prime Minister to London.[A communique in similar terms was prepared by the French for issue in France.]A MEETING of the Supreme War Council was held to-day on French soil.It was attended by Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Chatfield for Great Britain,and by M. Daladier and General Gamelin for France.The purpose of the meeting was to make possible a direct personal exchangeof views on the present situation, and on the measures to be taken in the immediatefuture.This meeting has fully confirmed the strength of the resolve of Great Britainand France to devote their entire strength and resources to the waging of the conflict which has been forced upon them, and to give all possible assistance totheir Polish ally, who is resisting with so much gallantry the ruthless invasion of her territory.
