COPY HO. ^ ? *WAR CABIITET.PIIiANCIAh POLICY.THE EXClJA-rOE POSITION;  INFLATION.Memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer,,There are two pressing dangers in the financialsphere -* (l) Exhaustion of our exchange resources9(S) Inflation.Exhaustion of exchann-e resources.1*        Our gold reserves arc- 5450 millionso    We e;cpectto get from the requisition of private holdings of foreign securities from 3200 millions to 5250 millions of foreigncurrencies.    The sum total of our resources is thus notmore than  700 millions*2. There is no real chance of any addition to this figure on capital account e,g. by borrowing abroad.The door is doubly barred on borrowing in the UnitedStates by the Johnson Act against war debt defaulterssand by the neutrality Legislation,    The possibility of borrowing in Canada is being pushed actively but that isanyhow a small matter.3. Neutral countries still have substantial funds inLondon.    The indications are that sterlings even at itsreduced gold value, is a currency which neutrals will wishto get rid of.    However favourable war news iss theprospects of vast expenditure would continue to disturb

neutral holders.    If war news were&apos; bad, the anxiety to get out would increase.    Although foreign deposits in Londonhave been very greatly reduced in the last eighteen monthsBthey still reach substantial figures and our banking debts to continental neutrals probably still exceed  100 million,,4. The figures of our gold resources look higher thanthey really are because they are expressed in terms of the currency value of the   of 4 dollars onlye    The  . in which our resources are measured is in gold value equal to just over one-half of the pre-1951 gold  c    It is equal to about six-sevenths of the   as it stood before the present crisiso5. We hold more gold than in 1914 and in some respectse&amp;go stocks of oil are far better equipped.      Our holdings of useful foreign securities are much less?6. Our total resources are vastly inferior.     At thebeginning of the last war our balance of payments was sofavourable that we were able to invest abroad at the rate of 200 millions a year, which, by stopping lending abroad, we$ould divert to war purposes.     When we entered this war wehad not only abandoned the practice of lending abroad butY/ere already to some extent drawing on our past investments.Moreover we were able to borrow over  1,000 millions from theUnited States Government and private American citizens.7o       So far as we can buy from sterling countries we importwithout losing exchange and the difficulty arises in respectof the following currenciesAmerican and Canadian dollarsSwedish and Norwegian KronerSwiss and Belgian francsDutch guildersArgentine pesos.Even if there were no increase in our total imports thedemand for dollars would rise greatly since shipping

.L a 4.considerations and the need of obtaining supplies quicklyor in some cases of obtaining supplies at all divert our&quot;buying from countries which would accept sterling to countrieswhich take gold every time,,       The Treasury is urgentlyengaged in summarising the demands for payments in the difficult currencieso   A preliminary analysis of the require-ments of Government Departments and private industry in thenext three months for these currencies amount to  106 millions,of which nearly  85 millions relates to purchases in theUnited States and 0anadao Allowing for exportss visible andinvisibles the Treasury estimates that our unfavourable&quot;balance with the United States in the next three months will he  36 millions and with Canada  20 millionsi   with theother difficult currencies included it amounts to something over  60 millions in the three months1 period (September -end of November) 0     To this must he added the demands forassistance in the form of free sterling to be given to poland and Turkey and any demands which may he received for expenditure in connection with blockade purposes08*       Nearly all the Departments state that their require-raents for dollars after the end of the next three months will expand rapidly0     It is obvious that we are in grave danger of our gold reserves being exhausted at a rate thatwill render us incapable of waging war if war is prolonged^I propose that the War Cabinet should issue directionsimmediately calling for-(l) the maximum possible restriction of unnecessaryimports involving payments in these currencies and earlyaotion as regards rationing schemes for home consumptionof commodities needing to be bought with such currencies;

(2) the greatest possible enc our age merit to export trade eIn this connection steps should be taken to restrictconsumption at home of goods which might be marketed abroad and to expand as much as possible&apos;  the production of exportgoods available in this country and particularly of coal which seems likely to be almost as valuable to us as gold;(3) the restriction of payments by the Defence Servicesparticularly in North America9 to the absolute minimum of essential and speedily available services;(4) the maintenance of a firm attitude towards demands from our Allies on our exchange resourcess particularly inthe case of France9 which possesses more gold than we do*Inflation,.9e      The first shock of war is deflationary but this changessoon into a strong tendency to inflation.    This change will be difficult to counteract on the present occasion owingto the very large disbursements being made in connection withevacuation and other civil purposes,,    We have set up a strictexchange control alreadys and are hard at work on limitationof importso    But exchange control and limitation of importsdo not prevent inflation - they only prevent inflation fromaffecting the exchange value of the  e10.       The essential instru^y^&amp;s    to prevent or restrictinflation are (a) monetary policys (b) taxations0 and(c) loan policy    For the time being our monetary policy-must continue on cautious lines and we must not be ledinto risking a great rise in -prices merely to satisfyclamour for a lower bank rate.9

3.1*       As regards taxations I propose to introduce and carry through a supplementary budget this month ifpossible, in which severe additions to existing rates oftaxation will he imposedo18*        As regards loan policy, plans are being rapidlyadvanced for Government borrowing,,     It will be necessaryfor the Treasury to ask for drastic powers, for instance to provide by compulsion, if voluntary agreement shouldfails that all bodies collecting savings such asinsurance companies, building societies, should investa stated proportion of the money collected in government stocks.     I am considering also as a matter of urgencyproposals to limit the size of dividends and to requirebusinesses to invest in war loans a proportion of theirundivided profits except where these are needed for theexpansion of firms engaged on armament work.13.       The ability of the Government to find the fundsnecessary for the war will be greatly increased by any measure which restricts the use of capital for privatepurposes.     We have already got plans in force or have plans in the making for dealing with this subject so far as itcan be dealt with on the monetary side, but it is alsoin my judgment of the highest importamce that speedyconsideration should be given to the restriction of civilian demand for capital goods by direct methods ofcontrol for which the plans for the control of materialsprepared before the War-do not make adequate provision.For instance the control scheme contemplated for iron and

steel neglects altogether the objective of reducingunnecessary civilian demands for steel until such time as a shortage of supplies becomes manifesto     It isvery improvident to wait until this stage is reached..These controls will need to be greatly increased in thenear future and I have asked Mr0 H0D0 Henderson (formerlySecretary of. the Eeoj^omSc Advisory Council, who is nowassisting us in the Treasury) to examine this subject as a matter of urgency0(mtido)  JoS*8th September., 19590Richmond Terrace, S.Wol.8th September, 19390
