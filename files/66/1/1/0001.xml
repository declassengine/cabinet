- PART i.(A) The Strategical,Effect of Italy remaining Neutral at the Outset of a War-y -      -      with Germany.   :------        ;u. If Italy were neutral- at the outset of the was;: the advantages to cLeallied causewould be as follows : &apos; (a) Spain would probably also remain neutral. In that event there wouldbe no threat to Gibraltar, and no airjthreat and less risk of submarinethreat from bases in Spain to our trade routes in the Western Atlantic,our Base Ports, or to French industries in southern France.(b) Although French and British capital ships might be contained in theMediterranean by the possibility of subsequent Italian intervention,they would &quot;not run the risks inseparable from operations of war.Consequently, they would remain a factor in the balance of navalpower vis-a-vis Germany and Japan.(c) There would be no actual threat to our interests in the Middle Eastand Red Sea areas, and therefore less likelihood of our having to facean urgent call for additional land and air reinforcements in the.Mediterranean.- (d) The Mediterranean trade route would not be closed, but shipping wouldhave to be convoyed through the central area as a precaution againstsudden attack: this would be to the Allied advantage not only inrespect of maintaining their trade with the Mediterranean and&apos; theFar East, but also as a channel of - communication by which, the warresources of Roumania, Poland, Turkey and Greece could be augmented.(e) The threat to Turkey and Greece would be reduced.(/) Once we were at war with Germany, our national war effort as a whole would be developed, and we hope &apos;our. Dominions would be takingactive steps towards the training and despatch of land and air forces to assist in Imperial Defence. The longer Italy remained neutral,therefore, the better we should be organised to meet her should sheultimately decide,to intervene against us.(g) There would be less temptation for Japan to join Germany.4. The only important disadvantage to the Allies of Italian neutrality isthat it would render the application of economic pressure to Germany moredifficult. Germany would not have to supply Italy with a proportion of her -warmaterial, and her resources would hot therefore be subjected to additional strain.5. From the above it will be seen that, although a neutral Italy would tosome extent handicap the application of economic pressure on Germany, itwould appreciably reduce our military commitments, and our military risks. Wetherefore conclude that Italian neutrality, if it could by any means be assured,would be decidedly preferable to her active hostility.6. The fact must be faced that Italy, as a member of the Axis, would be bound at least to make some gestures of a nature hostile to the Allies. this need not necessarily mean that she intends actually to intervene against us.If, however, it became known that she was carrying on war preparations thatleft no doubt that she intended to intervene at the moment best suited to her own or the German book, it might suit us to forestall her and take the initiative.We should in any event be taking the same precautionary measures, and maintaining the same forces in the Mediterranean, as if Italy were openly hostile;in addition, we should be watching her improving her position, never knowingfrom one moment to the next&apos;when she was going to strike. In these circum-stances we should have to decide, in the light of conditions at the time in all theatres of war, whether it would pay us better to play for time, even at thecost of further improvement in Italy&apos;s position, or whether we should force the pace and take some action to compel her to declare her position even at therisk of precipitating hostilities.(B) If Italy remains Neutral should Steps be taken to Compel her to Declare her position?   If so, what should these Steps be?7. In view of what has been said in paragraphs 5 and 6 above, the answers to these questions depend upon the character of Italian neutrality. We thereforeexamine &quot;them under three broad hypotheses.
8.&apos; If Italy should at the outset be strictly neutral, and there are grounds for believing that she, is genuinely anxious to avoid entering the war on theGerman side, we consider that no attempt should be made to compel her to declareher position by any measures which are likely to have the effect of bringing herin against us. On,..the contrary, it would be worth.our while to pay the high price, which.she would doubtless demand,&apos;in order to avoid this contingency.9. Again, if Italy v/ere technically neutral, but adopted an attitude sobiassed in favour of Germany as to handicap our blockade of that country, itmight still be inadvisable to take drastic action to compel her to declare herself.On the other hand; we could not afford to allow her to continue to supply Germanyto an unlimited extent, and it would be necessary to impose rationing restrictionson her of the same character as were imposed on the Northern European neutralsin the last war, i.e.. any supplies over and above peace-time levels would be cut off.10. Finally; if Italy, while remaining nominally neutral, were to permitGerman aircraft&apos;and submarines to use Italian bases, or if her actions left noroom for doubt that she intended to intervene against us at her own or theGerman selected moment, it might become necessary (as suggested in para-graph 6 above) to compel her to declare her position forthwith. If she should stillprofess neutrality, we should then demand guarantees which would ensure thatshe kept her word. Since, however, her true neutrality would be so preferable toher open hostility, the method of conveying this ultimatum would have to bedecided at the time according to the circumstances and our information as to thetemper of the Italian people.11. In view of the fact that Italy is in open alliance with Germany, theguarantee of neutrality that we first demand should be sufficient to demonstratecieariy Italy&apos;s intention to remain neutral, but not so drastic as to make itimpossible for the Italian Government to begin a cautious and gradual with-drawal from the Axis. It might be better, in the first instance, if possible, to put the onus on Italy by requesting her to suggest proof s of neutrality; if this requestwere ignored, or if the proofs suggested were plainly inadequate, it would benecessary to make some definite demand, such as for the withdrawal of troops and aircraft from Libya. If this in turn were rejected, it might finally be necessaryto make very drastic demands, which would result either in war. or in the over-throw by the Italian people of Mussolini and his G-overnment. These might takeone or other of the following forms : (a) The immediate breaking of her alliance with Germany, and the expulsionof all Germans from Italian territory.(b) The reduction of her Libyan garrison to the needs of internal security.(c) The withdrawal of her surface ships and submarines from the Red Sea;.the reduction of her forces in East Africa to the needs of internal security; the demilitarisation of the Dodecanese; and a demand that italian   submarines ,.aud   aircraft   should   not   operate   in   the- Mediterranean.&apos;It is important that our policy in this respect should be agreed not only with theFrench,- but with the Turks. Its effect on the attitude of Spain should also beconsidered.Pabt II.(A) In the event of Italy being Allied to Germany against us, what Effect wouldan immediate Offensive concentrated on Italy have in relieving the pressure of a German Attack on Poland in the circumstances visualised in C.I.D.Paper No. D.P. (P.) 59?-12. We assume that this question is framed to determine whether an offensive on Italy would have greater value as a diversion to relieve the pressure upon Poland than an offensive upon Germany.18. If it were by any means possible for the Allies to bring such immediatepressure to bear upon Italy as to make her capitulation possible before germany had completed the conquest of Poland, then Germany might be forced to relaxher pressure on Poland and go to Italy&apos;s assistance. It is, therefore, necessaryto examine whether the Allies are, in fact, in a position to bring the necessary-degree of pressure to bear upon Italy on tJw onft?et of the war.[19606] 3 2
At sea the. Allied naval forces would be considerably superior in theMediterranean so long as we were? not forced to despatch a fleet to the Far- East.Apart, however, from the economic pressure to which Italy would be subjectedand which &quot;would not produce:.1immediate results, naval forces could only bringimmediate direct pressure to bear on Italy by raids on her coast. This has never been a very effective form of warfare and in the early days of a war, before we: had had time to gauge the extent of the menace from submarines, aircraft andmines, might involve the acceptance of risks disproportionate to the results likelyto be achieved. It is true that such action might have some moral effect, but therewould be iittle, chance either of inflicting casualties on the Italian naval forces,who would be unlikely-to face a fleet action, or of bringing any material pressure to bear on Italy. ;\ 15. On land.&amp;ny action at the outset of war (which is the period we have toconsider) would have to be undertaken by the French. They have estimated thatan attack across the Italian frontier would require the employment of at least25 to 30 Divisions and could only be carried out in certain&apos; months of the year(July and; August in the northern and central sectors of the Franco-italian frontier, June to September 1 in the: northern part of the maritime Alps). the availability of these Divisions would depend on the situation on. the western front, and in particular on whether the Low Countries had been violated.In any event, they stated, that,.unless the unforeseen occurs, no action against italy could be undertaken until considerable kelp from Great Britain was available on the Continent,16. In the air we could bring little or no immediate pressure to bear uponItaly unless we were to attack Italian war industry, with consequent repercussionssimilar to those to which we have drawn attention in paragraph 14 of C.I.D.Paper No. D.P. (Pi) 59. The Turin-Milan-Genoa area, which contains the bulkof important industrial objectives including those in the aircraft industry is within relatively easy range of French soil, and is not defended on a scalecomparable to the corresponding areas in Germany. If we were able effectively to attack,this area, the immediate effect, both moral and material, would probablybe considerable, and might seriously undermine Italy&apos;s ability to continue thewar. Apart, however, from the well-known arguments against initiating air action against industrial objectives, the Allies would not be in a position this autumn to attack North-Western Italy really effectively. We could expect littleassistance from the French air force; and for technical and administrative reasons the British bomber force could not itself develop and sustain a sufficiently heavyscale of attack. To attempt to do so would involve duplication and a completere-orientation of our administrative arrangements, which could not be completed in the time.While, therefore, we should have alternative plans as soon as practicallypossible to attack Italy by air, we cannot recommend this course in the near future as a means of relieving pressure on Poland.17. Apart from, these matters the time factor, has to be considered, TheAllied land jind air forces must concentrate initially at the most dangerous point,i.e., North-West Europe. This is what our present plans envisage. Any changein these plans means delay, and weald thus defeat our object, which is to helpPoland as.soon as possible.18. The conclusion we draw is that no action that we can take against Italyon sea, on land, or in the air would materially relieve the pressure of a german attack on Poland.(B) In the event of Italy being allied with Germany against.us, what Effect wouldan immediate offensive concentrated on Italy have on the -position in theFar East?19. From the preceding paragraphs it is clear that such offensive operationsas can be carried out against Italy do not offer a prospect of such rapid successas would release naval and air forces for operations in the Far East in the early days of the war.On the other hand, a success in the Mediterranean and Red Sea Area wouldenhance our prestige and. might act as a deterrent to Japan.  If, on the contrary,
the naval operations visualised in paragraph-14 were to lead to heavy casualties,^apannught be tempted to turn the opportunity to her own advantage and ourultimate ability to defend our Dominions and other interests in the Far Eastmight be prejudiced.20. We conclude, therefore, that an immediate offensive concentrated on italy, far from improving, would tend to weaken our position in the Far East.&apos; Part III.Re-examination- of C.I.D. Paper No. D.P. (P.) 59 in the light of the conclusions reached in Parts I and IT above.... 21, &quot;--&quot;we now turn to examine our Memorandum (Paper No. D.P. (P.) 59) inthe light of the conclusions reached in Parts 1 and II above. We have shownthat ah offensive concentrated against Italy at the outset of hostilities is unlikely to relieve German pressure in Poland, and therefore that the problem remains asenunciated in pur original paper. It may, however, be helpful if we amplify it incertain respects.22. (It is explained in Paper No. I).P. (P.) 59 that, if Germany holds in theWest and attacks in the East, there is little that we ourselves can do either at sea or on land at the outset of the war to relieve the pressure on Poland, and therefore that the problem resolves itself into a question of what we can do in the air.&apos; 23. As to this, we realise that it would be impossible for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment,to decide, in advance of the ovent, the precise manner in which our air forces should be employed. Nevertheless, we consider it most important thatthe various alternative courses of action, with the military advantages and dis-advantages of each, should be carefully examined forthwith; in order that, whenthe time comes, they may be reviewed&apos;against the background of the political andmilitary situation then existing, and a decision taken in full knowledge so faras this is possible-of ail the factors involved.24. As a general point, we would emphasise that the fate of Poland will depend upon the ultimate outcome of the war, and that this, in turn, will depend upon our ability to bring about the eventual defeat of Germany, and not on our ability to relieve pressure on Poland at the outset. This must therefore be the over-riding consideration which governs our choice of action.25. There are four broad courses of action from which to choose. These are set out briefly below. It is assumed in each case that full national mobilisationhas taken place or is in progress and that we immediately put into force at seaail measurees of economic pressure including the stoppage of all German seabornetrade and the seizure of any German ships at sea.A. To take all necessary preparatory measures on land and in the air,including the despatch of the Advanced Air Striking Force and the1st contingent of the Field Force to France but not to initiate anyoffensive action in the air, except against warships at sea.B. To initiate air action against purely &quot;military&quot; objectives in the narrowest sense of the word- e.g., the German Fleet and its bases, airforce units and establishments, and the German Army on the Western; ;Front. :G. To extend our air action to cover objectives which, while as closely related as possible to purely military establishments, will have a moreimportant effect in reducing the enemy&apos;s capacity to carry on the war.In this category the most &quot;suitable objectives appear to be stocks of oil fuel and plant for manufacturing synthetic oil.D. To &quot;take the gloves off &quot; from the outset, and attack those objectives best calculated to reduce the enemy&apos;&apos;s war effort, irrespective of whether or.not such action: will cause heavy loss of life-to enemy civilians;.

It wouldnot enable us to strike at any of the objectives which are really vital toGermany for the prosecution of a longwar; it would have no effect in supple-menting the economic blockade, andwould not noticeably reduce Germany&apos;sultimate capacity to turn West in forceonce she has settled matters in the East.At the same time, the casualtieswhich our bomber force would sufferwould, be little if any fewer than thoseinvolved in operations against reallyprofitable objectives. The result mightwell be that when the time came to turn upon our best objectives, .as weshould wish to do if Germany decided on unrestricted air attack upon us, ouroffensive capacitjf would have been seriously reduced by the loss; of manyof our aircraft and best trained crews.

This might not have mucheffect on neutral opinion and weshould take all possible steps, evenpossibly to the extent of giving copiesof our directives to the U.S. Ambassadors-- &apos; dor, to counter this propaganda.   Itwould, however, be very likely to gives rise to unrestricted reprisals, causingheavy loss of life to our population.30. In cur view it would be uneconomical in effort to direct the whole weightof air. attack on to these limited -objectives.Moreover, incidental loss of civilian life consequent upon the attack of certainestablishments would involve many of the disadvantages of a less limited formof air action-without the corresponding advantage of inflicting &quot;serious -damage on germany which the less limited form would.permit..   , - Course C.01 Tc. evtend our air action to cover objectives which, while as closelyrelatkasvaSiletovurelv military establishments will have a more ^poHaruTXtiTJdvcvM the enemy&apos;s capacity to carry on the war. In this category the^^MTo^ves a^r lobe&quot;stocks of oil fuel and plant for munujac-(Ailing synth..tu, 01Advantages.(i) In addition to the advantagesmentioned in (i) of paragraph 29above (Course B), this course wouldhave considerably more effect in contain-ing-German air forces in the West andeven diverting them from the Polishfront.It holds out a chance of some rapidsuccess (and for its full success the co-operation of Polish, and if possibleRussian, aircraft against important oil-objectives,&apos;in- Eastern Germany wouldbe important), in which case it mighthave most important results in reducingthe intensity especially of air attack on poland, as well as subsequently on GreatBritain and France.Disadvantages.(i) Here again it is difficult to claim,with any certainty that this course willmaterially relieve pressure on Polandat the outset, for the same reasons asthose given in (ii) of the disadvantages of Course B above.On the other hand, an early success in this plan might cause the germans to intensify their attacks on Poland, inorder to settle matters, in the em si beforethe shortage of oil really made itselffelt.     1
A advantages.(ii) By., adopting this course we, should- be attacking objectives of which.the destruction would have a real andij almost immediate military value; Weshould be striking at a vital war supplywhich the Germans cannot replace(unless and until they can seize andtransport to Germany Rumanian oil,and that will take a long time), whereaswe have alternative sources of supply from overseas. The most importantobjectives in the oil group are the stocksof imported oil and refineries which areabove ground, vulnerable and mostlywithin reasonable range.(iii) The German air force opera-ting against the Allies, and the sub-marines that will probably be attackingour trade from the outset, are entirelydependent on oil fuel; the army is soto a considerable extent. The reactions of neutral opinion to the effects of attacks on oil would therefore probablybe not so adverse as to the effects of attacks on other less specialised formsof war supplies. Experience in theSpanish war lends some support to thisview.Disadvantages.(ii) Our own oil stocks are vulnerableand not yet covered by the full scale ofdefence. The supply of oil for the Navyis more important to us than to theGermans; for our Air Force it is equally important; and though bur Army is relatively small, it is more dependenton oil&apos; fuel than the German Army.On the other hand we can of coursereplace our stocks.(iii) Attack on;oil will certainly berepresented by Germany as ruthless *andindiscriminate action and amongst other things may lead to unrestrictedreprisals on tankers at sea as well asagainst objectives in the UnitedKingdom. The storage installations,refineries and plant for making-synthetic oil are manned by civilians.Some of the most vital installations arein the Open country away from populated areas. Others, such as the tank farms at hamburg, are in dock areas or, suchas the synthetic plants in the Ruhr, inhighly populated industrial districts.In general, there can be no doubt thatattack on oil, if it is to have a chanceof rapid and really important results,must involve considerable loss of civilian life.Course 1).82: To &quot;take the gloves off &quot; from the outset and attack those objectivestest calculated to reduce the enemy&apos;s war effort, irrespective of whether or not-such action, will cause heavy loss of life to enemy civilians.A advantages.(i) This course is probably mili-voluntarily the most effective, in that it givesus complete freedom of action to supple-ment other forms of economic pressure to the greatest extent from the outset,and to attack those objectives best cal-culated to shorten the period of german resistance, regardless of any restric-tions.Actually, at the outset however, ithas little advantage over Course C,except that our bombers could be givenalternative objectives included in othertarget groups of vital importance such-as power, ball-bearings, &amp;c.Disadvantages.(i) It would inevitably and imme-diately lead to retaliation in kind; andwe are not only considerably less strongin bombers than the Germans, but ourvital objectives, especially London, are more accessible and vulnerable.
Advantages. Disadvantages.(ii) Nil. (ii) It would be difficult, after ourrepeated declarations on the subject, tobe the first to undertake air action of a nature that could, and inevitably would,be interpreted with some reason asunrestricted air action. Actually our&apos; attacks   would   be   directed   against objectives in war industry vital to thecontinuance of Germany&apos;s war effort.Bu b, in the absence of any agreement onthe definition of a military objective,it would probably be difficult at the outset of a war to persuade world,opinion that objectives, some of whichare not even included in the tentativedefinition contained in. The HagueRules, are legitimate objects for attack.The probable alienation of neutral opinion, notably in America, would.have most serious military disad-vantages later in the war. Moreover, itwould bind the German people together and in this connection it has been represented that one effect of anycivilian casualties in Germany causedby allied air action, will be to put as top to any subversive movements whichwe hope to instigate against the nazi regime.Recommendation.83. We recommend, in view of our recent agreement on bombing policy withthe French, that the considerations set out above should be communicated to theFrench Staff, and that we should discuss the matter fully with them, with a viewto amplifying the arguments set out above, and facilitating the ultimate decision,if this becomes necessary. We should also ensure that these discussions shouldbe extended to Poland, and that no impetuous action on their part gives Germanyan excuse for indiscriminate retaliation against them or us.34. Whatever course we adopt, we should, take all possible steps to make clear, not only to neutral countries, but also to the German people, that our air action is directed only against those objectives whose destruction is calculated to shorten the course of the war, and that we have no intention of attacking thecivil population as such.   We should not, for instance, attack Berlin.This point should be brought to the attention of the organisation for conducting propaganda in neutral and enemy countries in time of war.(Signed) C. L. N.
