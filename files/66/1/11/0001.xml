This DocumpntrjLs the Property.Britannic, Majesty1 s Govern!of Hisovernment.s::or:;T.\P(39)11. Copy No. 3.7&apos;7AR CABINET.PUBLICITY REGARDING DESTRUCTION OF ORDAT.1AGE TO ENEMY SUBMARINES,&apos; BRITISHWARSHIPS AND MERCHANT VESSELS.&apos;Memorandum toy the First Lord of the Admiralty.I circulate the following to my colleagues in the form in which it was sent to me toy the AdmiraltyAuthorities concerned,      1 agree with the view that if in these opening weeks we have some successful attacks on submarines to record, we might deviate from the -general practice by announcing them.(initialled)..    W.S.C,6.9.39.

A. Sinking of enemy submarines.The Defence Notices of the Ministry ofInformation recently published contain the following:-Submarines.&quot;Operations by or against submarinesshould not be mentioned.Nothing should be published about thedestruction of any enemy submarine or capture of its crew.      No reference, direct or indirect,to the loss of any British submarine, except inrepetition of the terms used in the officialnotice.      In reports of sightings of enemy submarines,numbers borne by the vessel should not be published&quot;.20 The above notice enjoining a high degree of secrecy regarding enemy submarine losses, was based on theexperience gained during the unrestricted submarine warfareperiod during the   Great -War.      The policy was to leave theGermans in doubt regarding the fate of their submarines,and. thereby to engender a feeling of doubt and apprehensionas caused by the non return of submarines after a long vogageThe publication of any details regarding the number&apos; of thesubmarine, name of the Captain, or operations she was working on tend to jeopardise the success of anti submarine operations.3. Moreover,  should a submarine be destroyed at thebeginning of her voyage, it is important that the enemy shouldbe kept in ignorance,  so that they will not send out a relief.4. At the beginning of the Great War, severalenemy submarine losses were published, but as the war became more intense, the policy of silence was adopted.5&quot; On the other hand, the non publication of anysuccesses against German submarines would-undoubtedly depressthe   British public, who will then hear nothing but losses ofour own merchant ships.

B6, The Defence Notices quoted ahove preserve theAdmiralty right to publish or withhold information, andit is suggested that this right should he exercised with discretion, each case being judged on   its merits,      Forinstance, a good piece of work by a merchant ship resulting in the destruction of a submarine,  should, I think, hepublished without revealing too many details, and, in anycase, never the position or area.7* At the beginning of the war the rule of secrecymight be relaxed in order to hearten the public,8. The eventuality referred to in paragraph 3could be met by delaying publication for,  say, a month,9*    CONCLUSIONS.(a) Each case to be judged on its merits,talcing into account the intensity ofthe anti-submarine campaign and theneed to hearten the public.(b) Subject to the above, the principlesoutlined in the Defence Notices to be strictly preserved.(c) The situation to be explained to the public by an announcement&quot;&quot; on the following lines:-&quot;It should be realised that it will not always be desirable to publish news of the destruction or damage to enemy submarines by our Naval and Air Forces,and therefore because no news is published, it must not beassumed that no successes have been achieved.      On theother hand, the Admiralty will release information onthis subject whenever it is deemed to be advisable&quot;.

10ftPublicity regarding Destruction or Damage ofBritish men-of-war (other than submarines).10. The policy   to be pursued about publicity re-garding the sinkings of British and enemy   men-of-war isrevealed in the following Defence Notice (N0.3/NS)recently published:-Operations of Warships.&quot;No mention should be made of anysuccess of, any mishap to, or any move-ment (whether recent or prospective) ofany of his Majesty&apos;s ships of war.     no reference should be made to the number or class of British warships available at any time or at any place.      When a naval occurrence is officially announced,whether it be a success, loss or otherincident, the place where it happenedand the names of the ships or officersinvolved, or of other ships present (ifexcluded from the official announcement)should not be added&quot;.11. The above are Ministry of Information instructions and do not, of course, preclude the Admiralty frominitiating whatever announcement (whenever they like)regarding successes, failures, loss or damage of british or enemy men-of-war, or of giving whatever account theychoose of naval operations.      Subject to the proviso that the Ministry of Information may inpose some generalcensorship in conformity with Government policy, it isthe prerogative of the Admiralty to impose their own internal censorship and to propose for publication any-thing they wish.12. TJhe exact circumstances which surround anyparticular incident cannot be predicted and it maySometimes be expedient, for reasons which cannot republic

o,public, to withhold information regarding a loss bythe enemy of a surface man-of-war.     As a general rule,however, these losses will be published.13. As regards our own losses, each case must be reviewed on its merits and for strategical reasons, itmay be most desirable to maintain secrecy regardingdestruction or damage to our own ships.111. During the early stages of a war, the publi-cation of casualty lists would probably reveal the identity of the ship concerned, by means of referenceto a pre-war Navy List.15,    CONCLUSIONS.(a) It is desirable wherever possible toinform the public regarding damage or destruction to our own surface craft and to those of the enemy,(b) Subject to the above, the more putoli-city regarding the destruction of enemy men-of-war (other than sub-marines) the better,(c) On general grounds, it is desirableto take the public into our con-fidence and not to paint too rosya picture$ but occasions may arise when the balance regarding ourown losses should be on the side of secrecy as distinct from publicity,Each case should, therefore, be judged on its own merits.(d) In each instance it should be takeninto account whether anything is tobe gained by delaying publicationrather than withholding it.Publicity regarding the Destruction or Damage toBritish submarines (relative to the Defence Noticeat the beginning of this memorandum.)16, It is usually inadvisable to publish the loss ofO LI/.&quot; 000*09000

our own submarines if it can possibly be withheld,especially while our submarine flotilla is so small.Publicity regarding   Destruction or Damage to british merchant. Shins.17, The practice at the end of the Great   War isenshrined in the Defence Notice No.  7/MS recently publishedDamaged or Stranded Merchantmen.&quot;Reports of casualties to any kind ofmerchant ship, whether arising from theordinary hazards of the sea or from the act of the enemy should not be published withoutthe approval of-the Ministry of Information&quot;.18, The competent ministries to advise the Ministryof Information on this question are the Admiralty and toa lesser degree the Board of Trade (Ministry of Shipping),19. The practice during the Great   War was to publish losses, but withhold all details regardingposition and method, unless some overriding consider-ation rendered publicity desirable.      On the whole, itis undesirable that the public should be kept in ignorance of facts which may assist them in.drawing their own con-elusions regarding the progress of the war.20.    CONCLUSION.To publish losses of British merchant ships stating only that it was sunkI by submarine or raider, but with-holding details and, if necessary,delaying the publication.Publication of information regarding destruction of enemy Merchant Vessels.21, This question is governed by the same general considerations......

considerations which affect publication regardingenemy men-of-war, but on the whole there is very littlereason for withholding publication, unless the sequence of events which led to the destruction of the merchant-men are of a highly secret nature.22.    CONCLUSION.In general,  subject to the above, to publish information.23.    Allies.,Information regarding the destruction of alliedmen-of-war or merchant ships may occasionally be availableto \i8 before it is known to the ally in question.      Inall cases the concurrence of the allied authorities tobe obtained before the facts are published.Admiralty, S,v7.,l.5th September, 1939.
