THE WAR CABINET had under consideration a Reportby the Land Forces Committee on the size of the land forces at which we should aim in the present war andthe date of completion of equipment of the variouscontingents, as a basis for the production arrangements to be made by the Ministry of Supply (Paper No. W.P.(39) 14),THE LORD PRIVY SEAL, Chairman of the Land ForcesCommitteej, said that his Committee had felt that aquick decision was imperative, since the Ministryof Supply must be given early an objective for planning.     Hence the Committee had submitted a very short Report, in which they had omitted to state thatthey had accepted priority for our air requirements, aB4for some part at any rate of the naval programme,....   They had considered the land armamentsproblem in two of its aspects;-(i)     the size of the forces to be aimed at ultimately!(ii)      the size of the forces to be aimed at within the next 12 months eThe ultimate objective was to some extent amatter of guesswork.      The Committee had accepted as areasonable assumption a total of 55 Divisions for whichsupply must be arranged by the end of the second year of war, composed as under38 Divisions British Army.14 Divisions Dominions.4 Divisions India.50 Divisionsadd        5 Divisions     -     10% reserve for assistanceto Allies and so fortlu

Supply during the next 12 months was however the more difficult part of the problem.    As recently asFebruary, the Cabinet had contemplated a Field Force of only 6 Divisions.    In April they had raised this number to32.    Since capacity took time to develop, and we had made a late.start,  it would be an enormous task for theMinistry of Supply to provide for 20 Divisions duringthe next 12 months.    The First Lord of the admiralty had taken the view the the figure for the next 12 months should be 40 Divisions.    On the other hand, the Ministerof Supply had taken the view that it was only possibleto provide for 20 Divisions,  or perhaps a little more.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff had satisfiedthe Committee that the scales of-equipment were reasonable,and had said that he would prefer them to aim at an objective within the bounds of possibility, rather than to aim at an objective which wa.-: likely to prove impracticable.    He had attached great Importance tosecrecy regarding details of formations equipped, and the dates on which they went overseas0The Committee had attached importance to threespecific points:-(i)    that a statement should be made publicly that the Government were laying all their plans on the basis of at least athree years war.(ii)    that the Dominions should be told early -what we expected of them.    In thisconnection they felt that the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff should if possible give some DominionsFormations priority- in his programme ofdespatch overseas.

(iii)     That a mission should he sent early to paris to co-ordinate supply demandsbetween the French and ourselves.The Committee had realised that their proposals wouldhave serious repercussions on finance and on the exporttrade which would have to be taken into account.Nevertheless, they felt that it was better to start thewar with a clearly defined objective such as they now submitted.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that the WarOffice   were    satisfied  with the proposals of theCommittee.     The Lord Privy Seal had brought out in his remarks that our 32 Divisions were mainly of recentcreation.     There was also the point that up till recently,we had based our plans on scales of supply for an easterntheatre of war.     These scales were of courseconsiderably smaller than those required for the western front.     In spite of that, we should be able to send overseas11 Divisions within the next 6 months - a contribution oon-siderably in excess of our commitment to the French which wasto &apos;S$nd two Mobile Divisions and 4 Divisions as ear3y as possible.The 11 Divisions would have certain deficiencies^For instance, they were one A.A. Brigade short and this could only be remedied at the expense of A.D.G.B.     Further,the y        had a number of 3&quot; A.A.. guns, which must beconsidered inferior to the 3.7&quot;.     There was a deficiency in heavy artillery, but by the end of the first year thiswould not be so serious, since production plans for these weapons had been framed for 32 Divisions as against theSO now envisaged.     As regards field artillery, the forces would be accompanied by a considerable proportion of

f oobsolescent 18 pounder guns and 4.5,&quot; howitzers?pending replacement by the 25 pounder0THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that the. . .... ...work&apos; of the Committee -had been directed primarily to enabling the Minister of Supply to enteron his task.     It would be for the War Office todecide when and how the Divisions should be used,as they were equipped.     He felt that a layout for55 Divisions on the British scale of equipment within two years should be the minimum objective, and an objective within our powers.     The fact that we wereaiming at 55 Divisions should be imparted to the French.Reference had been made to hj.s dosire to see anincreased number of Divisions equipped during thefirst year.     It was not so much that he regarded 20Divisions in the first year as inadequate? as that he-.. ..thought those Divisions should go ;overseas at ;considerably earlier dates in the first year. He stillhad hopes that more than 11 Divisions would be ready forthe campaign in the Spring of 1940 oThe Minister of Supply had mentioned to theCommittee that cordite was one of his difficulties.He, the First Lord, thought that he could supply the army with 50 tons of naval cordite a week bydelaying the completion of reserves of ammunition for heavy naval guns.      The Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff had given the Committee a mostinteresting statement on the character of the army which we were sending abroad.      Much of theinformation given was highly secret but he felt thatone feature - the deficiency in heavy guns - shouldbe brought to the notice of the Cabinet.      Since supply

of these guns was some way off, he was quite preparedto see if the Admiralty could help0      They could possibly hand over some obsolescent naval ordnance,and might he able to divert some naval heavy gunproduction to army purposeso     He would, however,have to bring both these suggestions before the Boardof AdmiraltyeHe was in agreement with the total of55 Divisions for the long term objective, as he feltthat this was a wise figure, having regard to our airrequirements, man power resources and so forth.As regards a mission to France, he would suggest the formation of a joint Anglo-French body to co-ordinate all supply activities between the twocountries.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFreferred to the shortage of heavy artillery, and saidthat he had available for reconditioning, 180 9.2&quot;howitzers, which would however have to be provided with ammunition, new sights and so fortho      The range of this type of howitzer was short by 6,000 yards ofthe range of German guns of similar type.

THE PRIME MINISTER referred to a point whichhe considered of fundamental importance.     He had been relieved..to hear the Lord Privy Seal say that therecommendations of the Committee were subject to airpriority.     The complete superiority of the Germans inthe air in Poland had handicapped the operations ofthe Polish Land Forces, which had apparently been unable to concentrate   for   counter-attack.     It wouldalso appear that, in the face of heavy air attack,it wouldbe impossible to maintain the road and rail communications of land forces.     These considerations had brought home to him the importance of superiority in theair.     The Germans already had such superiority, and;ould undoubtedly seek to increase it by expandingproduction, and by sustained attacks on our centres ofproduction.     No doubt they would suffer very heavy losses but the possibility of serious dislocation of aircraft production in this country must be anticipated.He was doubtful whether they had sufficiently consideredthat aspect of the problem, which led him to feelthat we should now increase our aircraft capacity, moreespecially     since       the French were so deficient inthis respect.     He felt therefore   that the aircraft programme must be considered before a decision on thereport before them could be given by the Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said he would liketo support the army programme, but subject to a generalundertaking by the Minister of Supply that man powerand&quot;material would be available for the aircraft programme.     The Air Ministry had their plans laid for

doubling aircraft production, and they were alreadyexperiencing difficulty in certain supplies, such aslight alloys, which, however, might not affect theMinistry of Supply.     As regards operations againstthe Germans, the French were producing fighters buthardly any bombers.     Hence the Allies were relying on our Bomber Force which was inferior to that of theenemy.     He felt that, before the Cabinet gave a decisionsthe material and man power required for the expandedR.A.F. Programme should be examined.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY agreed that therecommendations in the Report of the Land Forces Committeeneeded to be dovetailed with the Air Ministry1^ require-mentse     Without a decision on the Army programme,however, the Minister of Supply could not plan his factorylayout.     While these factories were being prepared, therewould be no serious call on the skilled labour requiredby the Air Ministry.     He suggested that the suitablecourse was to adopt the present Report, and later to relate it to the programmer&apos;, of the other two Services.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR suggested that,since the Admiralty and the Air Ministry hadpriority, the proper course was to examine their requirements before reaching a decision on the Armyprogramme.,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR suggested that-it was important for the Minister of Supply to know his task now.     The layout of factories and the obtainingof materials took time, and ground lost could not be recovered later.

THE PRIME MINISTER thought it better to co-i*elatethe demands of all three Services before deciding onthe army programme.     He suggested that the cabinet could decide now that     supply for 20 Divisions in thefirst 12 months should be the immediate aim.     As regardsthe 55 Divisions^ a decision should be deferred untilthe Admiralty and Air Ministry demands had also been examined.     In the meantime he agreed that it would bedesirable for the Minister of Supply to start preliminaryplanning on the hasl&amp;of 55 Xr&amp;rtetiDm as the 3ong term -aim.   &quot;Thusno time would be lost   while a final decision was beingarrived at..    He agreed that a mission should be sentto Paris to co-ordinate supply demands with the French.A discussion ensued on the desirability ofenquiring from the Dominions their probable scale of effort in the war.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF pointedout that except for the Canadians, Dominions troops would probably not be employed in France.      It would be preferable to concentrate them in the Middle East, ratherthan bring them round the Cape to the United Kingdomwhere they would be exposed to air attack.     He thereforevisualised the employment of the bulk of the DominionsTroops in the Middle Eastern Theatre.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs pointed out that Canada, in the last War, had obtained twoArmy Corps by conscription;    hut that they were unlikely+-C adopt this measure in the present War.     South Africa-   . ahad stated that she was not prepared to send forces outsideAfrica.     For practical purposes,  therefore, the immediatepoint at issue was the size of the forces which Australiaand New Zealand were likely to make available.The suggestion was made that a communication shouldbe sent to the Dominions to the effect that we should welcome a contribution from them on the same scale as inthe last War.      In further discussion, however, it waspointed out that it seemed unlikely that Canada would.beable to make a contribution on the same scale as in thelast War.     Further, detailed communications had been sentto -fetoo-iDomiaMlons in the last few days,  informing them, ofthe ways in which they could give immediate help.In these circumstances, the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs thought that he would prefer to have timeto think the matter over before any further communicationwas sent to the Dominions on this matter.Summing up the discussion,  THE PRIME MINISTER saidthat the main point which emerged was that the questionwhether our ultimate objective should be 55 divisions should be further considered in the light of the demandsof the Admiralty and Air Ministry.    - It was clearly desirable that the Secretary of State for Air should beadded to the Committee.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that it wasonly in certain particulars that there was likely

4 O C*looto &quot;be any conflict between the needs of his department and those of the other two service departments.    Hethought that the Admiralty,  the Air Ministry,  theMinistry of Supply and the Ministry of Labour should atonce set on foot the necessary examination, with a viewto submitting material to an early Meeting of the land forces Committee.THE FIRST LORD OF the ADMIRALTY emphasised theimportance of the Ministry of Supply making rapid progress with planning on the basis of 55 Divisions.The War Cabinet agreed;--(i) To authorise the Minister of Supply to   .make all arrangements for the supply on the full British Army scale for atleast 20 Divisions within the first12 months of the war, and that heshould do his utmost to increase thisminimum.(ii) To authorise the Minister of Supply tomake early arrangements for the despatchof a Mission,to Paris to co-ordinate thesupply demand between the French and ourselves.(iii) To defer a decision on the size of theLand Forces which should be our ultimate objective in the present war until theLand Forces Committee had considered theproduction requirements of the three services as a whole.(iv) To invite the First Lord of the Admiralty,the Secretary of State for Air and theMinister of Supply,  In consultation with theMinister of Labour and Minister of NationalService, to prepare Memoranda on their supply requirements for the purposes ofthe examination by the Land ForcesCommittee required by (iii) above.(v) That, pending examination of the problem by the Land Forces Committee,  theMinister of Supply should be authorisedto start preliminary planning for thesupply on the full British Army scale of55 Divisions by the end of The second year of the war.

(vi) That, to assist in tiding over the early months of the war, arrangements should he made, either by improvisation from spareresources in this country, or, if practicable, by purchases from abroad,for an increase in guns, particularly of the heavier calibres.(vii) That, for the present, no furthercommunications should be made to DominionGovernments in regard to the size of theland forces which it was hoped they wouldmake available.
