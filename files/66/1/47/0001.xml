AFTER the Prime Minister had welcomed the french ministers, M. DALADIER said that he would like to discuss threeproblems which he regarded as very important and urgent: (1) The first problem was that of constituting a front in theEast.(2) The second problem related to the front in France andconcerned the Western area of operations between the rhine and the sea. It was, in M. Daladier&apos;s view,necessary to prepare for a possible German attackthrough Holland and Belgium.(3) The third problem was that of collaboration between theUnited Kingdom and France in the manufacture ofrmaments.M. Daladier thought it would be much more satisfactory todiscuss these questions personally than by correspondence.Eastern Front. As regards the problem of the Eastern front, M. Daladier thoughtthat it was essential to have an allied force ready to prevent a German advance towards the Mediterranean and the Straits. ThisAvas the motive underlying the conception of a Polish front, but unfortunately the front in Poland no longer existed. The question arose whether Roumania would be attacked by Germany. he himself did not believe that this would happen for the present. Hethought that Germany would make demands for Roumanian rawmaterials, and that the Roumanian Government, alarmed as a resultof the defeat of Poland, would prefer to give way to these german demands rather than to resist them.If it was generally agreed that it was necessary, in spite ofeverything, to maintain an Eastern front in order to hold up aGerman attack in the direction of the Mediterranean or to preventthe dislocation of the Balkan States, the means to this end must beconsidered. In this connection there was a danger that the dislocation-tion of the Balkan States might be a signal for Italy to interveneand to copy Russia in securing a share of the spoils. The FrenchGovernment therefore thought it most important to establish a forceeither at Salonica, if this could be done without endangering the neutrality of Italy, or at Constantinople with the agreement of theTurkish Government. It would, however, take twenty days tocarry out any decision that might be reached to move troops from france to this Eastern front. It was therefore essential that adecision should be taken as soon as possible. M. Daladier asked forthe views of the British Government upon this problem.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that before giving his views, hewould like to ask a question. He was not quite certain what. Daladier meant by his phrase &quot; the dislocation of the balkan states.&quot; A German descent on the Mediterranean might take place,either through Yugoslavia towards the Adriatic or throughSalonica. The second possibility might, he supposed, be counteredby the previous occupation of Salonica by Allied Forces. But he wasnot clear how the first possibility could be met. He also wished toknow whether there was any other point at which, in M. Daladier&apos;view, a descent upon the Mediterranean might be made. As regardsthe possibility of a dislocation of the Balkan States, he wonderedhow a force, wherever it was established, could prevent a german attack upon the Balkans or the dislocation of the Balkan States.M. DALADIER thought that, if the Balkan States were leftto themselves in their present state of terror, they would eithercollapse and accept whatever conditions the Germans chose to demand for delivery of their raw materials, food, &amp;c.; or, alterna-tively, that if they resisted, they would soon be broken by the force which Germany might bring against them. If, however, the allies had concentrated important military forces at Salonica or atConstantinople, this might act as a cement for the Balkan nations which would otherwise be discouraged and disunited.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that he was much obliged forM. Daladier&apos;s explanation, which had made clear what the latter had in mind. He agreed that it would be a great encouragement tothe Balkan States to see allied forces nearer to them than they were at present, and the British Government would have this questionexamined at once by their military advisers with a view to seeing : (1) What steps could be taken to make it possible to bring our forces to either of these points, and(2) What forces thus disposed could achieve.In point of fact, this problem was already being examined bythe Franco-British staffs in London.The first essential was to consider the position of Italy. TheBritish military advisers took the view that it was very important toprevent Italy joining Germany, and that any moye towards the balkan States which might have this result would, on balance,represent a loss rather than a gain. The second question of greatimportance was the position of Turkey. What was going to be herattitude and what were her relations with the U.S.S.R. ? We hadbeen trying very hard to secure an agreement with Turkey, and during the last few days this agreement seemed much closer than he had at one time thought likely. Now, however, the turksh foreign Minister had been invited to go to Moscow. The preciseobject of this visit was not known, but assurances had been receivedfrom the Turkish Government that whatever might happen in moscow wrould not influence Turkey&apos;s relations with us, and thatthe Turkish Government would, in particular, not be persuaded bythe Soviet Government to abstain from completing the agreement which was now under discussion with us, nor would they be persuaded to sign any agreement unfavourable to us. The turksh foreign Minister had left for Moscow last night, and wouldprobably return in a few days. His account of his talks with theSoviet Government would be of first-class importance. He himselfdid not regard the action of the Soviet Government in invadingPoland as having necessarily been taken in full accord with theGerman Government. He thought it more probable that the SovietGovernment were merely looking after their own interests, and thefact that they had shut off Germany from contact with Roumaniaseemed to support this view. There were, therefore, interestingpossibilities in the situation which required examination. Therehad also been indications that Turkey might be contemplating theformation of a Balkan neutral front, in which she would be the predominant partner. Whether she could, in fact, sustain this rolewould largely depend upon her relations with the Soviet Govern-ment. Soviet backing for such a move would be valuable at this juncture, whatever their ultimate motives.M. DALADIER said that it appeared that both governments were agreed on essentials. If Germany were allowed to dominatethe Balkans, the consequences could be catastrophic, since she would thus obtain the raw materials which were essential to her for a longwar. Moreover, if the Balkan States were dislocated, this would bean invitation to Italy to intervene, since she regarded herself as aBalkan Power and could not contemplate her exclusion from the balkan peninsula. The question was how to prevent this develop-ment. If Turkey and-the other Balkan States united in some sort ofa federation pledged to neutrality, the danger would be avoided.But the support of the other Balkan States and in particular of yugoslavia and Roumania would be required. Perhaps Russiansupport might be obtained, but M. Daladier did not personally&apos;- count upon this. These countries would, however, only act if they realised that we would so far as possible help them to defend their neutrality.An Allied force at Salonica or at Constantinople would strengthenthem in their resolution to defend their independence. He fully[20031] b 2
agreed with, the Prime Minister^ argument regarding Italy. there could be no question of sending a force to Salonica unless agreementwith the Italians had been secured. It was for this reason that hehad. suggested the alternative of Constantinople. If we could notrepeat at Salonica our action in the last war because of the.risk ofoffending Italy, then we might achieve the same object atConstantinople with the agreement of Turkey.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN agreed that our general purpose mustbe to prevent the domination of the Balkans by Germany. The only question was as to the best method of preventing this catastrophe.Possibly the proposals put forward by M. Daladier might providethe solution, but before reaching a definite decision it was essentialthat their implications should be examined by the Franco-british military advisers. One could, without being a military expert, forma judgment on general strategic questions. He himself felt that to divide our forces might in itself be a weakness. Moreover, themaintenance of allied forces in the Eastern Mediterranean meantlong lines of communications, and great demands upon our shipping and on naval vessels as escorts. All this meant a diversion of effortfrom other theatres of the war. He also understood that Salonicawas a most unsuitable base for offensive operations, and that its main value was defensive. It had a bad climate, malaria wasrampant, and during the last war there had been heavy losses amongthe troops in consequence. Access to the interior was also bad. Allthese considerations might be overruled, but they could not be ignored. As regards Constantinople the same general considerationsapplied. At the present stage, however, the first essential was toknow how Italy and Turkey would be affected by these proposals,and there could be no question of a definite decision until the resultsof the Turkish Foreign Ministers conversations in Moscow were known.M. DALADIER said that he had no intention of sending such large forces to either Salonica or Constantinople as would weaken the Allies on the Western Front. All he had in mind was to send a token force to strengthen the will of the Balkan States to resistGerman aggression. He agreed that the problem would have to be examined in detail by the Joint Staffs, but he felt that a decisionon the question of principle ought to be taken at once. It would bevery dangerous to continue to leave the initiative to Germany. Hesuggested the following procedure : (a) On the return of the Turkish Foreign Minister from moscow, an effort should be made through diplomatic channels to obtain the views of the Turkish. Governmenton the proposals under discussion.(b) Simultaneously, the views of the Italian Government shouldbe sought also through the diplomatic channel.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN agreed with the above proposals, ftwould clearly be prudent to have the ground fully explored, not only by the Joint Staffs, but also on the lines suggested by M. Daladier,in order that an immediate decision might be taken when the time came. It remained to consider how the enquiries suggested byM. Daladier should be conducted. As regards Italy, it would perhaps be better if the British Government took the&apos; lead. our ambassador was on very good terms with the Italian ForeignMinister, and could probably put the matter in such a way as tosecure the most favourable reply. As regards Turkey, he had novery definite views and would like to hear what M. Daladier had tosuggest. In any case, it seemed essential to await the return of theTurkish Foreign Minister to Constantinople, as the results of thelatter&apos;s conversations in Moscow would inevitably have aconsiderable bearing upon our approach.
M. DALADIER agreed that the British Ambassador shouldmake the approach of the Italian Government. As regards Turkey,he suggested that General Weygand should be used. The general had paid many visits to Angora and was always very well receivedby the President of the Turkish Republic and by the TurkishGovernment. He agreed that conversations should proceed betweenthe two General Staffs, but emphasised that they should be expedited. The matter had already been considered by the french general Staff and General Gamelin would explain the position.GENERAL GAMELIN said that conversations had takenplace with the British General Staff, as a result of which it had beenagreed that (1) In the present position it would be very difficult to supportRoumania if she were attacked by Germany.(2) At the beginning, our support for the Balkan States wouldbe mainly moral support arising out of the presence ofBritish and French units in the Balkans.(3) The total number of men to be maintained in the Balkanswould depend upon the maintenance of the lines ofcommunication, and therefore upon the freedom of theMediterranean.The important consideration would therefore be the course of operations in France and possibly also in North Africa, and much would depend upon whether Italy remained neutral or adopted a hostile attitude. As regards the French army, the position wasthat before hostilities broke out reinforcements had been sent to theNear East. At present, in addition to the troops required locallyto maintain order, there were present in French mandated territory in the Near East two mixed divisions of infantry and cavalry whichwere not absolutely complete. A start had also been made with thetransport from Algeria to the Near East of one complete divisionof North African troops, which it had been found possible totransfer from the Moroccan front without lessening the offensivecapacity of the French forces in Tunis. These troops were nowbeing sent to Beirut, but if a decision could be reached regardingthe establishment of a force at Salonica or at Constantinople, itwould obviously avoid the complications of transportation if theywere sent direct to either of these places.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN thanked General Gamelin for hisexplanation. As regards the conversations with the TurkishGovernment, he was a little uneasy at what he understood to be thesuggestion that these should be entrusted solely to General Weygand.These conversations would be very intricate and would deal not only with military matters. Our two Ambassadors would clearly haveto see the Turkish Foreign Minister after his return from moscow in connexion with (a) the Angld-Franco-Turkish Agreement, which still required signature, and (5) the conversations in Moscow. it seemed to him difficult to exclude the Ambassadors from our approach to the Turkish Government.M. DALADIER said that all that he had in mind was to exploit the very cordial relations between General Weygand and president Ismet Inonu. He therefore proposed that the twoAmbassadors should carry out the negotiations, but that general weygand should be associated with them and should be empoweredalso to see the Turkish President.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN agreed. He would certainly be very glad to make use of the. special relations existing between general weygand and the Turkish President, provided the two Ambassadorswere kept fully informed, and that the conversations with theTurkish Government were carried out on the purely hypotheticalbasis of an enquiry as to what would be the attitude of the Turkish[20031] b 3
Government in certain eventualities. He wished, however, to returnto a point which had already been raised at an earlier stage. Asuggestion had been made regarding a sort of neutral federation ofthe Balkans. M. Daladier expressed the view that, if this could beachieved, the domination of the Balkan States by Germany mightbe avoided. It was, however, difficult to unite this plan for the neutrality of the Balkan States with the plan now under discussion,since the very presence of foreign military forces on the territory ofa neutral State would be regarded as a breach of the neutrality ofthat State.M. DALADIER agreed. Here were two different hypotheses.First, the possibility of constituting a Balkan federation for themaintenance of Balkan neutrality. If we were not called upon to guarantee this neutrality, we should not send any forces to the balkans. The second hypothesis would only arise if the balkan states failed to reach such an arrangement. In that case, we shouldhave to support, through the presence of our armed forces, thoseBalkan States who wished to defend their independence and tomaintain friendly relations with us. There were, moreover, different forms of neutrality which had to be considered. Some might favourGermany and so endanger our interests in the eastern mediterranean.  Others would be strictly neutral.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN agreed. He felt that the neutrality of most of the Balkan States would be influenced by the fact that,although their sentiments were with the allies, they were alsofearful of taking any action which might draw down the Germanmonster on their heads. This conception of neutrality might leadthem to object out of their fear of Germany to doing things whichthey would have otherwise liked to have done.Mr. Chamberlain, summing up, suggested that there appearedto be general agreement that an exploration should be made in rome and Angora through diplomatic channels. The approach in Romeshould be made through the British Ambassador. As regardsTurkey, both our Ambassadors would approach the Turkish Govern-ment, and General Weygand would also be brought in to assist them.In any case, we should await the return of the Turkish Minister forForeign Affairs from Moscow before approaching the TurkishGovernment. Meanwhile, military conversations between our twoGeneral Staffs would continue and would be expedited.(The meeting adjourned at 1-45 p.m.)(The meeting was resumed at 3 p.m.)Anglo-FrenchCollaborationregarding theManufacture ofArmaments.British Assist-ance on theWestern Front.M. DALADIER felt that it was most important that contactshould be established between tlhe respective French and british authorities dealing with the manufacture of a.armaments in order toavoid dispersing our efforts. It was most important that we shouldpool our resources as regards credits, foreign orders, &amp;c. In par-ticular, we should approach the United States in a way which didnot separate the interests of the two countries. M. Dautry would establish contact with his British opposite number andM. Jean Monnet would assist in co-ordinating the activities ofvarious French and British, missions.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that he was in agreement with what M. Daladier had said on this matter.M. DALADIER said that he regarded it as most important thatthe British troops in France should be brought as close as possibleto the Franco-Belgian frontier not only for military but also for political reasons, as German propaganda had been very strong andwas extremely dangerous.
A further point which M. Daladier wished to raise was thequestion of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft guns. The french had lost a number of fighters on the Western Front, and he would therefore very much like to see the fighter formations at presentbased at Rouen and Le Havre replaced by British fighter formations.As to anti-aircraft guns, two groups were centred in the region of st. Nazaire and Nantes to protect the disembarkation of Britishtroops. French public opinion would, however, require the removalof these guns to a position nearer the Western Front if, as was verypossible, the Germans launched an offensive in the near future.M. Daladier therefore wished the French fighters at Le Havre andRouen to be replaced by British fighters, and French anti-aircraft guns at St. Nazaire by British anti-aircraft guns,Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that he had spoken to Mr. Hore-Belisha the previous day after the latter&apos;s return from France.There had apparently been some misunderstanding as to the exactline which the British troops should occupy, but it had now been settled that General Gort would establish contact in this matter with General Georges. The British troops would move up into theirassigned positions as soon as possible and dig themselves in. In thisconnection he wished to express his appreciation of M. Daladier&apos;remarks in his broadcast speech yesterday about the British troopsin France, which he thought would be most useful to counter german propaganda. What M. Daladier had said about the air position was new to him, but he understood that the necessary contact hadalready been established and that the Chief of the Air Staff had been to France the previous day. He asked what were the actual numbersof the anti-aircraft groups and of the fighters.M. DALADIER explained that there were two groups of anti-aircraft, each of 12 guns, in the St. Nazaire-Nantes district. Therewere also 5 groups in the Lille-Lens-Rheims district, making inall 7 groups, or 84 guns. These were needed on the Western Front,where the German aircraft had a numerical superiority of 5 to 1.When M. Daladier had visited the front, the French soldiers hadcomplained that they saw nothing but German planes and askedwhere our guns were. M. Daladier therefore asked that theseFrench groups should be progressively replaced as quickly aspossible by British batteries. This was particularly necessary as aGerman air offensive might be expected shortly. It might not be ona very great scale, but it would at least be aimed at proving german air superiority. He would also like to see the following Frenchfighter groups replaced by British fighter groups : one group of fighters in the Somme area and two groups slightly in the rear,making 80 aircraft in all.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that he would take up thisquestion as soon as he returned to London with every desire to help.GENERAL GAMELIN said that he would give completedetails to General Ismay. They hoped that we should be able togive help in respect of fighters and anti-aircraft guns wherever thelatter had been used for the protection of British troops or of Britishzones of disembarkation. He had seen Sir Cyril Newall the previous day. He had said that he would do his best, but the matter wouldhave to be submitted to the British Government, since the french proposal affected the defence of Great Britain. General Gamelinemphasised that if the bulk of the German forces were now turnedagainst the allied forces in France, the issue of this battle might decide the war.He explained that the British Army had been offered the sectorbetween the Lys and the Scheldt. This would be a sector of 40 kms.which could immediately be occupied by one British division. Hewould leave there the French division at present occupying this
sector, which would be under British command. Eventually5 divisions would be needed for this sector on a basis of 8 kiloms. perdivision. French troops would be at hand to reinforce the Britishtroops, if necessary, but there was no immediate risk of attack in.this sector.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked whether General Gamelin could give any general estimate of the numbers of the German and allied forces on the Western front in the event of a major offensive.GENERAL GAMELIN estimated that the Germans wouldhave a total of 128-130 divisions, including reserve formations.They would have to leave some divisions in Poland, czechoslovakia and Austria, and he calculated this would leave them with90 divisions for the Western front. He understood that the british general Staff put this figure at 100, but the French thought this was too high. If the attitude of the Italian Government remainedneutral, then General Gamelin could take 12 to 15 additionaldivisions from the army of the Alps and the army in North Africa.These two armies at present comprised 30 divisions, 15 in the Alpsand 15 in North Africa. If he took 12-15 divisions for the western front, there would still be effective protection in the Alps and north Africa. If he could not move these divisions, he would then have 65-70 divisions on the Western front. He could also count upon the advantage of the French fortifications, but, on the otherhand, he had to reckon with German air superiority.In reply to a question from the Prime Minister, general gamelin explained that the French army was now absolutelymobilised.M. DALADIER said that M. Dautry had pointed out v/ithforce that every available man had been mobilised in France in orderto be able to resist an attack which might be made simultaneouslyalong the wdaole front from Belgium to Tunisia. Many workmen.who were necessary for munitions factories, had been mobilised but would have to be sent back to their factories.M. DAUTRY said that some 50-60 per cent, of the Frenchpersonnel of munition factories had been mobilised, and at LeHavre in particular, where the &apos;&apos; 75s &apos;&apos; were made, 70 per cent, ofthe workers had left. He calculated that at least 50,000 munition workers would have to be sent back to their factories. He thereforeurged that every effort should be made by Great Britain to increasethe manufacture of guns and, in particular, of anti-aircraft guns.The French had reached their maximum production of anti-aircraft guns and had even neglected other military necessities for thispurpose.Mr. - CHAMBERLAIN said that priority had already beengiven to the manufacture of anti-aircraft guns in Great Britain,and that our capacity had been very considerably increased, althoughit had not yet reached its full extent. This question and anyconnected questions - could be discussed between the competentBritish and French Ministries.Staff Conveusa- Mr. Chamberlain said that he wished to revert to a point he hadtions with mentioned at lunch to M. Daladier.  We had asked our AmbassadorBelgium. in Brussels to make representations regarding the desirability ofstaff conversations with the Belgian Government. The result hadnot been very satisfactory, as we had been told by the BelgianGovernment that they did not believe in the danger of an imminentattack upon Belgium by Germany. They alleged that the GermanGovernment were seriously afraid that we might attackthemthroughBelgium, and that, if rumours got about regarding staff conversa-tions between Great Britain and Belgium, the Geimian government might make this an excuse to invade Belgian territory. It had been pointed out to the Belgian Government that we could not contribute
very much to the defence of Belgium, unless plans were thought outin advance. The question was to be discussed between members ofthe Belgian Government, and that we might expect a further communication in the next few days.Bulgaria. Finally, he wished to inform the French Government that aweekago King George had written to King Boris of Bulgaria on thequestion of Bulgarian neutrality. His Majesty had said that wehad been forced into war with Germany in view of Germany&apos;sfailure to respect her solemn promises and obligations. We realised that Bulgaria was in a specially delicate position, and we thereforeappreciated all the more her neutral attitude, which we sincerelyhoped would be maintained. There then followed a phrase, towhich he wished to draw special attention, in which King Georgehad told King Boris that he could rest assured that Bulgarianneutrality would be respected by the British Empire in the fullest possible degree, so long as it was not violated by others.M. DALADIER expressed his approval of this communication.It was agreed to issue a communique, the terms of which are contained in Annex A.(The proceedings were closed at 4 p.m.)ANNEX.Copy of Communique issued to the British Press subsequent to the Return ofthe Prime Minister to London.A MEETING of the Supreme War Council took place to-day in England.It was attended by M. Daladier, M. Dautry, General Gamelin and admiral darlan representing France, and Mr. Chamberlain, Lord Halifax and LordChatfield representing Great Britain.Two sittings were held, in the morning and the afternoon.. The developments which have taken place since  the meeting of  the12th September were reviewed, and their effect on the future course of eventsestimated.There was complete agreement on the course to be followed, both to meet these developments and to give effect to the Allied plans.The Supreme War Council considered the question of munitions and supplies, and agreement was reached on procedure for co-ordinating andperfecting the arrangements to be made by the two Governments.
