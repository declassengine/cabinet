THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  September 1939.SECRET.TO BBE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEYCopy No.W.P. (39) 15.It is requested that special cafe may be taken ensure the secrecy of this document,WAR CABINET.THE SITUATION INTHE FAR EAST.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN connection with the question of improving Anglo-Japanese relations, Icirculate to my colleagues of the War Cabinet a paper on the subjects of theevacuation of British garrisons from China and the problems connected withTientsin.THE policy of the Japanese Government, as indicated by recent telegrams from Tokyo, appears to be to concentrate upon a settlement of the China incident,to adopt a watchful but independent attitude towards the European war and to adjust Japan&apos;s relationships with foreign Powers. It is highly improbable that japan will align herself with either side or become embroiled in European affairs,unless and until there are clearer indications as to the probable outcome of the hostilities. While determined to achieve her aims as far as possible in China, itis to be expected that the Japanese will avoid a head-on collision with the democratic Powers in view of the value of their trade, and there are alreadyindications that she will seek to expand her markets in our direction in the hopethus of finding a solution to her economic problems and reducing the burden of herdebt. Japan has concluded a truce with the Soviet Government which has put an end to the fighting on the Mongolian border, but the Japanese ambassador in London and a high Japanese Foreign Office official have ridiculed the idea thatthis local truce could lead to a. non-aggression pact, and have expressed the opinionthat despite appearances to the contrary, Soviet policy, which aims at the ruinin the end of Germany and the exhaustion, if possible, of Japan, remains unchanged.2. There is no indication, however, that Japan has weakened in her attitudetowards China, and it is clear that she proposes at an early date to set up a central Government under her control with Wang Ching-wei at its head. this government will presumably be accorded immediate recognition by Japan, who may be expected either to conclude peace with it, or even an alliance, constitutingherself, as was the case in Manchuria, the protector of the country. The newpuppet Government may be expected in due course to declare its intention to abolish extra-territoriality, foreign concessions and other foreign rights. It ispossible&apos; that it may then declare its neutrality in the European war, and usingJapanese troops as its instruments, seek to disarm and intern the armed forcesof belligerent Powers, i.e., of Great Britain and France.H.Foreign Office,September 22, 1939.The Situation in the Far East.10575   [20030]B
3. On the 5th September the Japanese Government addressed a note to the belligerent Powers, in which they stated that they considered it necessary to offerfriendly advice to them that they should voluntarily withdraw their troops andwarships from China. Copies of this note were handed to representatives of theUnited States and Italy for the information of their Governments. Since then,probably as the result of strong representations of the United States Government&apos;,the Japanese Government have endeavoured to mitigate the effect of their note,but there is evidence that they have not abandoned this aim and that they are merely slowing down the tempo of their policy. This is consistent with their traditional tactics of receding slightly when pressui^e is met with, only to renewtheir own pressure when the moment is opportune.4. In view of the fact that our garrisons in China serve no essentialmilitary purpose and are hostages to fortune, and that their withdrawal hasalways been contemplated as a part of any ultimate settlement of the situationin the Far East, the question of an early withdrawal has been receiving serious consideration. So far, the United States Government have failed to give anyprecise indication as to the action they would take in any given circumstances,but they have, on the other hand, shown that they are strongly opposed to theremoval of our garrison at any rate from Shanghai. In view of the paramountnecessity of retaining American goodwill, it is submitted that this garrison shouldbe retained, and that we should watch the trend of events.5. The situation in North China is somewhat different, and there is reasonto believe that America would not afford the same support there as at Shanghai.In a conversation with our Ambassador at Washington, President Roosevelt alsodrew a distinction between Tientsin and Shanghai. There is, further, the point that, whatever the Japanese aims elsewhere in China, they are determined notto relinquish their control in North China, and that sooner or later, in view ofour existing commitments in Europe, we shall be obliged tacitly to accept the fact of continuing Japanese control in North China, even though we should not onany account accord formal recognition to it for the present. Nor should we take any action which would amount to a formal abrogation of our rights there underthe Treaties and render it impossible to resume our position at a later date. Thisis a point to which the United States Government attach great importance.6. It is in the light of these considerations that the local position at tientsin must be judged.  This position can be considered under two headings : (a) evacuation of the British garrison; and(6) the settlement of the currency and silver questions, in order to clear upthe Tientsin incident, the negotiations in regard to which are insuspense,7.   As regards (a), there appear to be three alternatives : (1) Voluntarily to withdraw the garrison as a contribution towards betterAnglo-Japanese relations. The situation in Europe and the floods at tientsin, which have rendered the British barracks thereuninhabitable, may be held to offer a better opportunity for with-drawing the garrison without appearing to concede to the Japanesedemands than we are likely to have again. The moment for withdrawal would have to be carefully selected; it should, for example,be after a settlement of the Tientsin question, so that it would givethe impression of withdrawing from strength rather than weakness.The French and United States Governments would have to be givenample warning. The broad lines on which the notification would bemade to the Japanese Government have already been considered (seetelegram No. 327 to Paris), and the notification should be drafted soas to represent it as a voluntary act; the main object in view shouldbe to discourage American criticism as far as we can.(2) Not to withdraw the garrison as a voluntary act, but to wait on events and to withdraw only in the face of a threat of direct action by theJapanese armed forces.(3) It might be considered preferable, as involving less loss of prestige, tohold fast and, at the worst, submit to being disarmed and eitherinterned by the Japanese or permitted to evacuate under United Statesprotection if this were possible.
8. I recommend that course (1) be followed, namely, voluntary withdrawalat the most appropriate moment, which should preferably be after a settlementof the Tientsin incident.9. The withdrawal of our garrison from Tientsin would, it is thought,contribute towards an improvement. in Anglo-Japanese relations, but, as suggested above, it is desired if possible first to resume the suspended negotia-tions regarding Tientsin, with a view to reaching an agreement which will resultin the raising of the blockade. There are encouraging signs in recent telegrams from Tokyo and Tientsin that the Japanese are themselves anxious for a resumption of negotiations, and this gives rise to the hope that some form of compromise may be possible which will not be unacceptable to the Americans andFrench, and also to the Chinese Government. The outstanding problems are(a) the custody of silver deposits and (b) the circulation of currency in the concession.10. As regards (a), silver, the following proposals have been made : (1) Thesilver to be sealed where it lies in the Bank of Communications until the close ofhostilities, (2) the silver to be sealed in a neutral bank, (3) the silver be handedover to the Yokohama Specie Bank or the Federal Reserve Bank, (4) the silverto be sold and the pi^oceeds used for the relief of flood victims in North China.11. As regards (b), currency, it Las been suggested that the Japanese might agree to withdraw their demand that we should prohibit the use of fapi orChinese national currency in the concession, on condition that we put no obstaclein the way of the cumulation of Federal Reserve Bank notes, and that an agree-ment on the silver question also is reached. As a matter of fact, the federal reserve Bank notes have long been accepted in payment of taxes by the concessionauthorities. This solution would be acceptable to us, but we do not yet know ifit is acceptable to the Japanese, and the prospects are uncertain; but it is possiblethat the Japanese might agree provided we could meet them over the question ofthe silver reserves.12. The crux of the matter is clearly the disposal of the silver. In connexionwith this, no less than in regard to the withdrawal of our garrisons, the AmericanGovernment have made it plain that they do not favour the policy of offeringbribes to the Japanese or signing away rights and titles. The suggestion thatthe silver should be handed over to the Yokohama Specie Bank or the federal reserve Bank would thus appear to be precluded, since it is difficult to believethat the silver would be effectively neutralised in this way. It is unlikely thatthe Chinese, Americans or French would regard this solution as other than asubterfuge and a surrender of principles. The only alternatives therefore aresealing in a neutral bank, whether in the British Concession or outside Tientsinaltogether, or its use for flood relief.13. Sir R. Craigie thinks the Japanese would favour the flood relief solution,but Sir A. Clark Kerr does not believe that this solution would be acceptable tothe Chinese (for the reasons stated above) unless the fund were administered byan international body such as the International Red Cross Society. As theJapanese have a deep-rooted dislike for international bodies in any affair whichthey conceive to be one between themselves and us, this solution does not appearlikely to meet with approval.14. In the face of the above, it would appear that a settlement of theTientsin negotiations can best be sought on the lines of (a) (2), (a) (4) and (b) above,that is, sealing of the silver in a neutral bank or its use for flood relief, and acceptance of Federal Reserve Bank currency in the concession.15. So much for the local issues. The question of seeking for an improve-nient on broader lines of our relations with Japan is under active consideration,and the&quot; possibility is being explored of making some kind of friendly gesture byway of offering facilities to trade. This question is, however, extremelycomplicated, dependent as it is upon the requirements of Departments such asthe Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of Economic Warfare, and considerableconsultation will be necessary before it will be possible to determine the extent towhich we can afford facilities of the kind contemplated. Sir George Sansom has,however, already begun consultation on behalf of the Foreign Office with theDepartments concerned.[20030] b 2
16. I accordingly recommend to my colleagues (a) that we should voluntarilyevacuate our garrison from North China at the most suitable moment, and (6) thatwe should endeavour to reopen the Tientsin negotiations, on the basis of the sealingof the silver reserves in a neutral bank, or their utilisation for flood relief purposescombined with a declaration that it is not the intention to obstruct the use of federal reserve currency in the British Concession.Foreign Office, September 22, 1939.ANNEX.Viscount Halifax to Sir E. Phipps (Paris).(No. 327.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, September 9, 1939.TOKYO telegram No. 1178 [of the 6th September: Japanese attitude to european situation].1. The French Government, like His Majesty&apos;s Government, will have been giving careful consideration to the communication made to them and to otherbelligerents by the Japanese Government, on the 5th September. Before this communication, His Majesty&apos;s Government had been considering the desirabilityof making changes in distribution of their forces in Far East, and outbreak ofwar has, of course, made it more than ever necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to distribute available forces to best advantage. From a purely military point of view, His Majesty&apos;s Government would favour early withdrawal,although naturally they do not underestimate other considerations which must be present to the mind of both our Governments. So long as these forces remainwhere they are, there is a serious danger of the Japanese creating trouble whichmay lead to that head-on clash which it is the principal object of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, like the French Government, to avoid. His Majesty^&apos;s Governmentare only reluctant to proceed to any immediate measures of withdrawal becauseof the possible misconstruction which may be put upon this in the light of the&quot; friendly advice &quot; of the Japanese Government.2. Before deciding finally what answer to send, it seems essential to ascer-tain the extent of the United States support on which we can rely.3. The United States Embassy here informed me on 8th September that thePresident of the United States the previous day drew the attention of theJapanese Ambassador to the effect that any action on the &quot; advice &quot; given by theJapanese Government to belligerent Governments would directly affect the rightsand interests of the United States. At Shanghai, for instance, the Powers hadboth individual and common responsibilities. Shanghai had been built up by thecommon efforts of the various Powers whose respective rights and interests therewere interdependent. No one Power had ever claimed a right of preponderancethere. If the British and French forces were withdrawn, a situation would be created which would present practical difficulties both for the United States and japan. For several foreign Powers to be forced out means to the United Statesthat all Powers are being forced out. The President concluded by asking the ambassador how the Japanese would expect to continue to have friendly relationswith the United States when they persisted in disregarding and destroyingUnited States interests.4. From this it might be inferred that the United States government intended to adopt a stiff attitude, anyhow as far as Shanghai is concerned. but whether this attitude would be sufficient to preclude possibility of politicallyembarrassing situation arising at Tientsin, where our position is particularlyexposed and where the United States are not so directly concerned, is another matter.
5. On balance, His Majesty&apos;s Government are disposed to inform the UnitedStates Government in the following sense : *(a) We have taken note of the tenor of the Presidents communication to theJapanese Ambassador. Having regard to the grave situation withwhich France and Great Britain are now confronted in Europe, wehave above all things to consider the avoidance of unneseccary frictionin other parts of the world.(&amp;) While naturally anxious to give weight to any considerations which theAmerican Government might think it right to raise, we are disposed to inform the Japanese Government that, as is only natural, theemployment of these forces elsewhere has for some time been underconsideration.(c) We should add that we think it very probable that we may decide on military grounds to withdraw the garrison, anyhow from Tientsin inthe near future.(d) The Japanese Government will be notified immediately a final decision is reached, and meanwhile we have taken note of the offer which theJapanese Government have made about the protection of British lives and property if and when British forces are withdrawn.6. In making this communication to the Japanese Government our ambassador would naturally emphasise that the removal of our troops was undertaken on military grounds and should be regarded as temporary and inno way prejudicing the rights which we enjoy under the Treaty of Tientsin andthe Boxer Protocol. Further consideration would have to be given to the positionof Shanghai in conjunction with the other Governments interested.7. Please enquire very urgently of the Government to which you are accredited whether they are in agreement with the line proposed, and if not,what alternative course they would suggest. They will appreciate that circum-stances may at any time easily arise which will make it increasingly difficult towithdraw with safety or dignity.(Repeated to Washington, No. 497; Tokyo, No. 592; Shanghai, No. 879;Commander-in-chief, China, unnumbered; Hong Kong, unnumbered; and singapore, unnumbered.)
