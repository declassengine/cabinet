With the supply and financial aspects of Canadianco-operation we are not competent to deal, and weunderstand that they   are being dealt with directbetween the Dominions Office and the Departmentsconcerned.

&quot;5 Qel O&quot;Ke-.Jb.ave therefore confined our re*&amp;a.rks to thevarious forms &quot;of naval, military and air co-operation which might he provided &quot;by Canada.iNAVY.R.C.N. Destroyers,4. The six destroyers of the R.C.N.  to be placed under Admiralty orders.      We are advised that for political reasons the two destroyers on the westcoast must remain there.    We should prefer to employthem on the East coast.      The completion of thefitting of Asdic equipment to Saguanay and Skeenaand the fourteen minesweepers is an urgentrequirement.Halifax Base.5. The naval base at Halifax to be placed in astate of complete readiness including the placing ofA/S boom, and the base to be made available for use byH.M. Ships.Esquimalt Base.&apos;6. The naval base at Esquimalt to be similarlyprepared, but this is of secondary importance toHalifax.Sydney, Cape Breton.7. Requirement - 8 M/S vessels to be taken up andfitted out.St.. John*s. Newfoundland.8. Requirement - 6 M/S and 3 A/S vessels to be taken up and fitted out.

Oil Fuel.&apos;:9. The immediate provision and maintenance of areserve of 30,000 tons of naval fuel oil at Halifaxis an essential requirement.Small Craft.10.        Any assistance which His Majesty&apos;s Government inCanada could give to the Commander-in-Chief, A.W.I,  inthe provision of small craft for A/S and M/S duties in local defence of West Indian harbours, after Canadiandefence requirements have been met, would fulfil an urgent need.Seaward Reconnaissance.31 The provision of aircraft for seaward reconnaissance of the Convoy Assembly P0rt at Halifax,Fleet Air Arm.12,        It would be of great assistance if Canada could provide in war the following facilities for aircraft and aircraft reserves of naval units operating on either coast:Halifax.    Aerodrome facilities for the operation of six aircraft and accommodation andmaintenance of twenty reserve aircraft,,Esquimalt.   Aerodrome facilities for the operation ofthree aircraft and accommocation andmaintenance of eight reserve aircraft,13.        The immediate provision and maintenance at Halifaxfor Fleet Air Arm formations of 500 tons of D.T.D.  230aviation spirit,  and 30 tons Aero lubricating oil D.

Accommodation for one officer, five, C.P.0s.  and P. 0s.  and  eleren men.

A.M.C&apos;s Fitting Out and Manning.

D.E.M.S. Arming and Provision of Personnel.

Naval Control Service.

A.M.C&apos;s.

15. The following ships are now being requisitioned for service as A.M.C&apos;s and it is desired that the Canadian Government should undertake to arm them as shown below.

MONOWAI ) Esquimalt

RAJPUTANA ) Esquimalt

LETITIA East coast port.

MONOWAI and RAJPUTANA are at present in Australia and China respectively. Their probable date of arrival at Esquimalt will be communicated later. LETITIA has been ordered to remain at Quebec pending further instructions. It is desired that the fitting out of this ship at an East coast port should be taken in hand at once.

The fourth A.M.C. equipment at present held at Esquimalt will not be allocated for the present.

D.E.M.S. arming.

16. Twenty-seven D.E.M.S. and four first line equipments are held at Esquimalt. It would be appreciated if the Canadian Government would proceed with the arming of ships as circumstances permit either at east or west coast ports. It would be preferred if convenient, that the majority of these equipments should be transferred to the east coast for ships trading in the North Atlantic, as trained personnel from the United Kingdom cannot at present be made available to serve as gunlayers in D.E.M.S., it is requested that they may be provided from Canadian sources. D.E.M.S. instructional staffs, shown as being required at Canadian ports in Appendix 3 to C.B.01764(39), to be provided if possible from local resources.

Naval Control Service.17. It is intended to send two trained officers for duty at the convoy assembly port at Halifax toassist in organising the convoy service.     The canadian government is requested to provide additional personnelrequired for this staff .and for the naval ControlService Staffs at Sydney, Cape Breton, Quebec andVancouver.Personnel.18*    (a) Surplus naval reserves to Canadian requirements to he made available for Imperial uses.(b) Officers - Recruiting from civil life for thethe following:-(i) Trained civil pilots for service in P.A.A.(ii) Yachtsmen or ex-mercantile marineofficers suitable for R.N.V.R.commissions.(c) Recruiting from civil life for following:-(i) Telegraphists and signalmen,(ii) Artificers of all kinds,(iii) Scientists (twenty to thirty) -electrical and W/T for SignalSchool.(iv) Sixty skilled electrical workmen.Note: The service of the above officers and men would net necessarily be confined to canadian waters.Warship Construction.19. It is requested that an examination of thepossibility of building the following types and numbersof warships in Canada for the Royal Navy may be made:-

(i) Destroyers.    Nil.(ii) Patrol Vessels.Any good shipbuilder could build.Say, up to twenty-five ..of the whale-catchertype would be required,(iii) Escorts &apos;BLACKSWANf  type.    Warships requiringgood workmanship.Say, uo to ten would be required,(iv) Small Minesweepers.    (Reciprocating Engines),Any good shipbuilder could build.Say, up to fifteen would be required,(v) A/S trawlers.Any good shipbuilder could build,Say, up to fifty would be required.In the above connection, Admiral Sir A,P. Addison,K.B.E., is now proceeding to Canada and will be able toamplify these details.    In addition, Admiral Addison hasfull details of Admiralty requirements of Guns and gun mountings, Ammunition, Mining Stores, W/T. Equipment andOptical Instruments.Pull plans and specifications for these ships wouldbe provided by the Admiralty.

A R M Ye -2$*       We should hope that Canada will exert her fullnational effort as in the last wan including the despatchof an expeditionary force     But if no statement of policy on these lines is possible at the moment the followingrepresents a rough programme which the Prime Minister mightoutline to Parliament:-(a)   Units(i)    On sentimental grounds and for reasons of canadian prestige the despatch of a smallCanadian &quot;unit capable of taking its placein the line alongside United Kingdom troops would be of great value,(ii)    Our later contingents will be short of certain technical units and the provision by Canada ofthese would be most welcome0   We shall requireparticularly -Signal UnitsSurvey UnitsRoyal Engineer UnitsOrdnance UnitsMedical UnitsTransportation Units (particularly railway construction and operating units).(ft)   Personnel,We should welcome at once technical personnel for enlistment in British. Units.   We particularlyrequire *&quot;*PitterseElectricians^Mechanics*Instrument MechanicssMotor transport DriversOfficers with similar qualifications are also required,,21?       It should be pointed out to Canada that the policyin the United Kingdom is to avoid a rush of volunteers such asoccurred in the last war and to expand by means of a controlledintake-     For this reason personnel for voluntary enlistment inthe United Kingdom should be limited in the early stages to the personnel given aboveB   In particular it should be pointed out.that no volunteers can be accepted for infantry or artilleryat presents

22* The offer &quot;by Canada to participate in theprotection of Newfoundland should &quot;be accepted in view ofthe importance of the Bell Island iron ore mines inConception Bay0      Only police forces are at present available for its protection.23. The economic importance of this mine has beenstressed recently by the C.I.D.    Instructors for theorganisation of a defence force in Newfoundland are dueto leave Liverpool for Newfoundland on the 5th September.AIR FORCE.24. We understand that the Royal Canadian Air Force isnow being re-organised on a basis which will ultimatelyprovide 11 Permanent and 12 Auxiliary Service Squadrons,in addition to the various ancillary units required fortraining and maintenance - purposes,,25. We also understand that the majority of these squadrons will be located in the West under Western AirCommand, with its headquarters in Vancouver, while theEastern Air Command, which is to be located at Dartmouth,Nova Scotia, will be much, smaller, but will contain atleast one General Reconnaissance Squadron,On the assumption that the telegram attached at annex II represents the present position regarding this squadron we confirm that we should like it to co-cperatewith naval forces operating from Halifax vide paragraph 11above.23* With regard to the remainder of the programme wewould point out that there is little likelihood of japanese hostility in the present circumstances.      On the

other hand we may have difficulty in meeting ourpersonnel requirements $ particularly in respect of pilots and aircraft crews, if intensive air operationsdevelop in Western Europe.27s       We therefore suggest that the best way in which canada fyould assist us in the air, after making provision for their own vital requirements, would he to concentrate first on individual training with a view to providing a valuable pool of pilots, observers, airgunners, and W/T operators, particularly the last two categories, rather than by forming and training completeunits for despatch to Europe (Canadian ExpeditionaryForce units excepted).   Ultimately, as and when sufficientRo0eA.F. officers and personnel are available in England andFrance, the aim would be to form an RSC.A.F. contingent,38c,       If this role is acceptable the first step would beto adopt an intensified war training Scheme with theirexisting resources, similar to our own, with a view to theimmediate increase in the existing output of 120 pilots ayear (65 of these are now trained for us)Q   Further steps would be(a) A rapid expansion of present training facilitiesusing civil aerodromes0    Suggested aim - 2,000pilots a year.   &quot;We may have to give instructorsand aircraft*(b) It is also most important that Canada should trainas many observers and air gunners as possible -perhaps by using existing Service Squadrons, forwhich there may be no immediate role in war0(c) Immediate enlistment of skilled mechanics inCanada, both for their own expansion and for -

the R.A.F.;    the.. .lat-ter-^ould,be ^^onv\3-r-&quot;tedto Royal Air Force trades in this country,We could accept up to 1,000 as a beginning,,(d)We may wish, at a later stage, to transfer atleast four R.A*F. Flying Training Schools tosites in Canada.     This will require further detailed considerationRoyal Air Force Supplies.27.     &apos;   A Technical Mission left on 2nd September, for canada with full authority tc investigate and report uponwhat material can be supplied for Royal Air Force purposesby Canada.      The most important item which we hope toobtain in large quantities from Canada is complete aero-engines, particularly of the radial type.     For example,,we shall probably require at least some 1,200 WrightCyclones, type G-a205.B, and we should hope to obtain these in course of time at the rate of some 120 per month.     Weshall also require supplies of various alloys for thepurpose of manufacturing engines and other aircraft equipment in England.     Other important items which weshall hope to obtain from Canada are as follows:-Various instruments including altimeters, directionalgyros, artificial horizons., etc. ;    radio valves;    bombs andpyrotechnics of various types;    containers for carbondioxide and possibly hydrogen.The full details have been given to the Mission.&quot;(Signed) C.L.N.

AKIjSX I.CYPHER TELEGRAM.CANADAFrom the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Canada.Dated 1st September, 1939. Received 6,29 a.m., 2nd September.Most Immediate.No.  304.    Most Secret.My telegram NQ.  299 of 1st September.    PrimeMinister sent for me this evening to say that afterprotracted cabinet meetings1 during the day he is mostgratified at absolute unanimity of all members includingFrench Canadians and he feels that his policy during thesecritical months is justified now by the fact of a unitedCanada ready and willing to help Great Britain to the utmostof its power and resources.    He plans to telegraph direct to the Prime Minister shortly but in the meantime he asks meto; enquire from the United Kingdom Government informally andto communicate to him unofficially before Parliamentmeets on 7th September what assistance they actually desirefrom Canada.    He has no hesitation in saying that Canada will assume responsibility for the protection of her Atlanticcoastline and her commerce and will also assist in theprotection of Newfoundland (see my telegram unnumbered tothe Governor of Newfoundland of to-day repeated to youNo.  303) but he must present to Parliament some definiteprogramme of participation including as he suggests food supplies, raw materials, munitions and aviation pilotsof which last named a considerable number should be ready tocome according to tin opinion expressed by the Minister ofNational Defence in council meeting to-day,

He then raised question of an--expeditionary force,mention of which in Parliament will almost certainly(? group omitted) acrimonious debate hy reactionaries.I told him that the United Kingdom Government were aware that Canada might he unwilling to consider the despatchof expeditionary force hut I thought that there would helarge number of volunteers eager to enlist for service in Great Britain and their assistance would be welcomedthough the Government of the United Kingdom would not want to do anything to weaken defence forces of Canadaif his Government consider it necessary to reserveessential manpower for home defence.    He neither agreednor disagreed with this but asked me to ascertain theUnited Kingdom Government&apos;s views on the subject forhis own private information.My personal impression is that while he wants aperfectly frank statement of your desires, he would prefer that no great account should be made at this juncture upon the despatch of an expeditionary force as he is eager to present the world with an almostunanimous vote when Parliament meets.    May I suggesthowever that advantage be taken of this opportunity toprofound financial requirements in an attempt to relieve strain on the exchange occasioned by purchaseof large supplies of food and materials.I do not anticipate any lack of naval co-operation.

ANNEX IICypher Telegram from the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in Canada.Dated&quot;25th August.Received in the Dominions Office at 5. 38 a.m. oh26th August,  1939.IMPORTANT.No.  283 Most Secret.My telegram No.  270.  My telegram No.   271.I have just received letter from Minister ofNational Defence stating that my representations havebeen very carefully reviewed by Canadian Air Staff.Canadian Government promise complete co-operationso far as they themselves are concerned.      As regardsJamaica Defence duties can only be taken in hand aftermeeting their own urgent requirements.      At Halifaxthey can provide practically immediately service squadrons of seven Stranraer flying boats capable of undertakinggeneral reconnaissance and escort duties.      Operationof land-based aircraft from Halifax is stated to be dependant on completion of first runway at Dartmouthaerodrome and an acquisition of suitable generalreconnaissan.ee aircraft such as long-nosed Blenheimsfrom Union or a contemporary type from United States.
