Paper No. DP. (P.) 67.)(Previous reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 355th Meeting, Minute (5).)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence on the organisation of the Higher Command in france in war (C.I.D. Paper No. D.P. (P.) 67.)LORD CHATFIELD recalled that the Committee of Imperial Defence had approved the conclusions and recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff on theorganisation of the Higher Command of the forces in France as set out inparagraph 25 of C.I.D. Paper No. D.P. (P.) 50, subject to the examination ofthe larger problem of supreme control by the Allied Governments. this examination had been carried out, and the Committee had approved in principle*the arrangements for Inter-Allied control recommended in C.I.D. PaperNo. D.P. (P.) 64, and the Prime Minister had undertaken to communicate themto M. Daladier. Assuming that the French Government agreed u the proposalsfor Inter-Allied control, he suggested that the Committee&apos;s approval should nowbe given to the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff on the organisation ofthe Higher Command in France, on the understanding that the Commander-in-Chief of the British Field Force, who would be placed under the orders of a french Generalissimo, would be at liberty to appeal to his own Government beforeexecuting any order which appeared to him to imperil the British Army. TheFrench authorities should be asked whether these proposals were acceptable to them.THE COMMITTEE agreed.Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed:  (a) To approve the conclusions and recommendations of the Chiefs of Staffon the organisation of the Higher Command in France in war as setout in paragraph 25 of C.I.D. Paper No. D.P. (P.) 50, namely:  Army Aspect.(i) The arrangements for the command of the Field Force whenoperating on the Continent should be based on the subordina-tion of its commander to the French Commander-in-Chief on* C.I.D./864th Meeting, Minute 3..19707-4]
the understanding that the Commander of the Field Force willbe at liberty to appeal to his own Government before executingany order which appears to Ihim to imperil the British Army.Air Aspect.(ii) The formations of Bomber Command, comprising the advancedair-striking force located in France, will receive their operationorders from the Commander-in-Chief, Bomber Command., These formations will conform to the administrative anddisciplinary regulations of the Army Commander in whosearea they find themselves.By means of the close liaison which will be established between the Air Staff, the Commander-in-Chief, Bomber Com-mand, and the French High Command, it should be possibleto meet the requirements of the French Generalissimo, withoutdelay, in the circumstances when the principal efforts of bomber command as a whole are concentrated in support of the land forces in battle on the Western Front.Circumstances might arise, such as a comparative lull onthe land front, when it might be possible to release some FrenchBomber squadrons from duties in direct collaboration with theland battle. On such occasions, these squadrons might well beplaced under the direction of Commander-in-Chief, bomber command.(&amp;) That the French Authorities should be informed, and their concurrenceinvited, to the above proposals.(c) That, pending the appointment of the permanent military advisersreferred to in Minute 1 (c), the above communication to the french should be made by the existing United Kingdom Delegation to theAnglo-French Staff conversations.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 24, 1939.

It was agreed by both Delegations thatthey should consult their respective superiors on this important question and discuss it during the next stage of the conversations.In this Memorandum we have dealt first with the Army aspect followed bythe Air Force aspect.The Army Aspect.2. In the instructions issued to Sir John French in August 1914, a copyof which IS coh Cell ned in Appendix I, it was laid down :  &apos;&apos; I wish you distinctly to understand that your command is an entirelyindependent one, and that you will in no case come in any sense under theorders of any allied general.&quot;3. Sir John Frenches independence of command led to considerable frictionduring the early stages of the campaign. Examples are the lack of co-operationbetween him and General Lanrezac, as a result of which the British right flankwas left uncovered and Sir John French suggested that he should withdraw tocover the Channel ports, leaving the French left uncovered in turn; and theneedless delay in beginning the advance from the Marne owing to the necessityfor General Joffre to convince Sir John French of the wisdom of the move.Later in 1914, and in 1915, when the situation became more stabilised, theneed for unity of command was not so apparent.4. In the instructions issued to Sir Douglas Haig, on his assumption of command in 1915, a copy of which is given in Appendix II, relations with theFrench were defined as : &quot; The closest co-operation of French and British as a united army mustbe the governing policy; but I wish you distinctly to understand that your[19074] &apos; b
command is an independent one, and that you will in no case come under the orders of any allied general further than the necessary co-operation with our allies above referred to."

5. During 1916 co-operation between the two Armies was adequate, chiefly, perhaps, owing to the good relations between Sir Douglas Haig and General Joffre. Early in 1917, however, General Nivelle was appointed to replace General Joffre. Owing to his insistence, the British army was placed, by the terms of the Calais Agreement, under the direction of the French Commander-in-Chief for the projected offensive only. The terms of this Agreement were as follows :-

"(1) Attendu que l&apos;armée française dispose d&apos;effectifs plus considérables que l&apos;armée britannique, le Cabinet de guerre reconnaît que la direction générale de la campagne doit appartenir au commandant en chef de l&apos;armée française;

(2) Pour la période comprise entre la signature de la présente convention et le début des opérations, le Cabinet de guerre s&apos;engage à donner au Maréchal Douglas Haig l&apos;ordre de se conformer aux vues du Général Nivelle en ce qui concerne la conduite des opérations, étant convenu qu&apos;il sera libre de choisir les moyens;

(3) Les opérations terminées, la convention tombe."

6. The working of this agreement was never satisfactory. General Nivelle interpreted it as implying a much closer control of the British Army than Sir Douglas Haig, who was not prepared to abdicate from his responsibility for the safety of his Army, would accept; moreover, Sir Douglas Haig became more and more convinced that General Nivelle&apos;s plans for the forthcoming offensive were unsound. Relations between the two commanders became very strained, and with the failure of the 1917 offensive the agreement lapsed.

7. After the replacement of General Nivelle by General Petain, no serious difficulties arose until the German offensives of 1918. When it appeared that the Germans might break through, General Petain seriously considered with-drawing the French Army to cover Paris, thus allowing the French and British Armies to be separated. To prevent this catastrophe General Foch, with sir Douglas Haig&apos;s full concurrence, was appointed Allied Commander-in-Chief. His instructions were in the following terms:-

"General Foch is charged by the British and French Governments with the co-ordination of the action of the Allied Armies on the Western Front. He will arrange to this effect with the two Generals-in-Chief, who are invited to furnish him with the necessary information."

8. The instructions to Sir Douglas Haig, consequent upon this arrangement, are reproduced as Appendix III. Briefly, these explained that "in consequence of the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the appointment of General Foch as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces on the Western Front" it had become necessary to modify Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s previous instructions. After confirming that the objects of the British Armies in France remained unchanged, the instructions continued:-

"You will carry out loyally any instructions issued to you by the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces. At the same time, if any order given by him appears to you to imperil the British Army, it is agreed between the Allied Governments that you will be at liberty to appeal to the British Government before executing such order. While it is hoped that the necessity for such an appeal may seldom, if ever arise, you will not hesitate in cases of grave emergency to avail yourself of your right to make it."

9. This arrangement worked satisfactorily for the rest of the campaign. A contributory factor to its success was, no doubt, the excellent relations between the Commanders principally concerned.
M10.   The conclusions to be drawn from the experience of 1914-18 axe :-(a) Independent command may be satisfactory when operations are pro-progressing favourably, particularly if the situation is comparativelystable. It is, however, apt to lead to dangerous situations in times ofemergency.(b) Unified command is undoubtedly more efficient from the point of viewof the conduct of operations. The objection is that the BritishGovernment, in effect, hand over to the French Government the controlof the destiny of the British Army, for which they themselves must remain responsible to the nation. This objection can be overcome by, allowing the British Commander the right of appeal to his own government, though there is, of course, the danger that such appealmight cause delay in operations.11. In either case, of course, the successful application of the system adoptedmust depend upon the personalities and mutual tact of the Commanders concerned,but there is no reason to suppose that, if a British Commander cannot serve with-out friction under a French Commander-in-Chief, there would be any less frictionif the same two Commanders had to co-operate as equals, whereas, where relationsbetween the Commanders are good, unity of command cannot fail to improveco-operation between the Armies.12, We recommend that the arrangements for command of the Field force should be based on the subordination of its Commander to the French Commander-in-Chief in France.13. Under the present organisation, General Gamelin, as supreme commander-in-Chief in War, would have under his command two separateArmies in France, besides the Army of North Africa, the French Air Force and,in certain circumstances, the French Navy. It is possible that this system maybe altered by the appointment of a Commander-in-Chief of the Armies in France.In either case, in placing the British Field Force under the command of general gamelin, it would be necessary, in order not unduly to restrict his discretion inits employment, to agree to its subordination, if General Gamelin so desires, eitherto the Commander-in-Chief in France (if appointed) or to the Commander of theFrench &quot; Army of the North-East.&quot;The Air Aspect.14. The Bomber Command of the Royal Air Force constitutes an increasingly formidable force for offensive action against an enemy in war. the basic strategical principle in the direction of the operations of this force, and inthe selection of objectives for attack, is that by virtue of its extreme tacticalflexibility within its radius of action it can and must be concentrated on thattask which is of most decisive importance at the time.15. Thus the method of the employment of Bomber Command will vary fromtime to time according to the circumstances of the war. In the event of a vitaldanger to the United Kingdom such as might be constituted by the main enemy air attack being concentrated against England, its primary object will be to counter such attack and to reduce its scale as far as possible. Circumstances may arise in which the most serious threat to the allied cause may be the action of enemy Naval forces-as in April 1917; in such circumstances the most effectiveemployment of Bomber Command for the time being might be in action againstthe enemy Naval forces and their bases. In the event of a critical threat toFrance, such as might arise in the event of the main enemy land and air attackbeing directed through the Low Countries, the defeat of such an attack wouldbecome the decisive task at the time; and in this event the squadrons of bomber command would be concentrated in the greatest possible force on that task.Finally, there will be periods when the ultimate defeat of the enemy may best behastened by the intensification of pressure against his economic and industrialsystem; during these periods Bomber Command can make a most important contribution to such pressure.16. The decision as to what constitutes the decisive task at the time will beftade by &quot;the British Government acting with the advice of the Chiefs of staff close collaboration with the French Supreme Command.[19074] B 2
&quot;17. The Advanced Air Striking Force is a formation of Bomber Command,and will be based in France in order that the relatively short-range aircraft withwhich it is at present equipped may be able to attack their objectives more effectively than they could from bases in the United Kingdom. It will receive its operation orders from the Commander-in-Chief, Bomber Command, who will-ordinate its activities with those of his other groups;18. It is important to be quite clear that the Advanced Air Striking force is not located in France in order to enable it to collaborate with the French andBritish armies. There will no doubt be periods when it will be so employed. on occasions when land operations in France are the decisive factor of the moment,the French generalissimo will be able to call not on the Advanced Air striking force alone but on the resources of Bomber Command as a whole.19. It will thus be clear that Bomber Command is on a totally different footing, and has a far wider sphere of responsibility, than the Field Force inFrance, whose task is confined to land operations on the Western Front. There is,therefore, no question of placing Bomber Command or any portion of it underthe orders of the French generalissimo. Those formations of Bomber Commandlocated in France will, of course, conform to the administrative and disciplinaryregulations of the Army Commander in whose area they find themselves.20. It is essential that not only the Chief of the Air Staff but also theCommander-in-Chief, Bomber Command, should at all times maintain the closestliaison with the French High Command, through the medium of the Missionswhich have been specially established for that purpose.21. Such close- liaison on the part of C.-in-C, Bomber Command, is obviously of particular importance in those conditions when the principal efforts of Bomber Command as a whole are concentrated in support of the land forces inbattle on the Western Front whether in defence or in attack. The most compre-hensive arrangements are being made the details of which need not be elaboratedin this paper to ensure in these circumstances the most effective collaboration of Bomber Command in the land battle, and that the requirements of the Frenchgeneralissimo are mat as rapidly as possible.22. In particular, it must be possible, in moments of really critical dangerwhen time may be the essence of the problem, to get into action with the least possible delay those squadrons of Bomber Command whose influence could mostrapidly be made effective.23. To meet this requirement it is proposed to authorise the Head of theBritish Air Mission, in times of real crisis, to use his own discretion to allot tasksdirect to the Air Officer Commanding the Advanced Air Striking Force,informing the Commander-in-Chief, Bomber Command, so that the operations ofthe other Bomber Groups, operating from the United Kingdom, can be adjustedaccordingly.24. It appears to the Air Staff that it may be possible from time to time, inperiods of comparative inactivity on the land front, or when some other classof operation may be of more decisive importance at the moment (see paragraph 15above), to release some French bomber squadrons from duties in direct collabora-tion with the land battle. On such occasions the most effective co-ordination and direction of the allied air operations as a whole would be secured by placing suchFrench bomber squadrons as may be available under the direction of C.-in-C,Bomber Command.Conclusions and Recommendations.25. To sum up, our views with regard to the organisation of the higher command in France in war may be summarised as follows, and we recommendthat the United Kingdom Delegation should be authorised to discuss this question with the French on the lines of the foregoing memorandum.(a) Army Aspect.We recommend that the arrangements for command of the Field Forcewhen operating on the Continent should be based on the subordination of itsCommander to the French Commander-in-Chief in France.
(b) Air Aspect.The formations of Bomber Command, comprising the advanced air-striking force located in France, will receive its operation orders from the Commander-in-Chief, Bomber Command. These formations will conform to the administra-tive and disciplinary regulations of the Army Commander in whose area they find themselves.By means of the close liaison which will be established between the AirStaff, the Commander-in-Chief, Bomber Command, and the French High Com-mand, it should be possible to meet the requirements of the French Generalissimo,without delay, in the circumstances when the principal efforts of Bomber Commandas a whole are concentrated in support of the land forces in battle on the western front.Circumstances might arise, such as a comparative lull on the land front,when it might be possible to release some French Bomber squadrons from duties in direct collaboration with the land battle. On such occasions, these squadronsmight well be placed under the direction of Commander-in-Chief, bomber command. &apos;. (Signed) C. L. N. NEWALL..  GOUT.A. B. CUNNINGHAM,D.C.N.S.

Instructions to Sir John French from Lord Kitchener, August 1914.OWING to the infringement of the neutrality of Belgium by Germany, andin furtherance of the Entente which exists between this country and France, HisMajesty&apos;s Government has decided, at the request of the French Government, tosend an Expeditionary Force to France and to entrust the command of the troops to yourself.The special motive of the Force under your control is to support andco-operate with the French Army against our common enemies. The peculiar tasklaid down upon you is to assist the French Government in preventing or repellingthe invasion by Germany of French and Belgian territory and eventually to restore the neutrality of Belgium, on behalf of which, as guaranteed by treaty, Belgiumhas appealed to the French and to ourselves.These are the reasons which have induced His Majesty&apos;s Government to declare war, and these reasons constitute the primary objective you have before you.The place of your assembly, according to present arrangements, is Amiens,and during the assembly of your troops you will have every opportunity for discussing with the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army the military position in general and the special part which your Force is able and adapted toplay. It must be recognised from the outset that the numerical strength of theBritish Force and its contingent reinforcement is strictly limited, and with this consideration kept steadily in view it will be obvious that the greatest care mustbe exercised towards a minimum of losses and wastage.Therefore, while every effort must be made to coincide most sympatheticallywith the plans and wishes of our Ally, the gravest consideration will devolveupon you as to participation in forward movements where large bodies of french troops are not engaged and where your Force &quot;may be unduly exposed to attack.Should a contingency of this sort be contemplated, I look to you to inform mefully and give me time to communicate to you any decision to which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment may come in the matter. In this connection I wish you distinctly tounderstand that your command is an entirely independent one, and that you willin no case come in any sense under the orders of any Allied General.In minor operations you should be careful that your subordinates understandthat risk of serious losses should only be taken where such risk is authoritativelyconsidered to be commensurate with the object in view.The high courage and discipline of your troops should, and certainly will,have fair and full opportunity of display during the campaign, but officers maywell be reminded that in this their first experience of European warfare, a greater measure of caution must be employed than under former conditions of hostilitiesagainst an untrained adversary.You will kindly keep up constant communication with the War Office, and you will be good enough to inform me as to all movements of the enemy reported..! you as well as to those of the French Army.I am sure you fully realise that you can rely with the utmost confidence onthe whole-hearted and unswerving support of the Government^ of myself, and ofyour compatriots, in carrying out the high duty which the King has entrusted to you and in maintaining the great tradition of His Majesty&apos;s Army.KITCHENER,Secretary of State.
Instructions to Sir Douglas Haig, of December 1915.HIS MajestyV Government consider that the mission of the British Expedi-tionary Force in France, to the chief command of which you have recently beenappointed, is to support and co-operate with the French and Belgian Armiesagainst our common enemies. The special task laid upon you is to assist theFrench and Belgian Governments in driving the German Armies from Frenchand Belgian territory, and eventually to restore the neutrality of Belgium, onbehalf of which, as guaranteed by Treaty, Belgium appealed to the French andto ourselves at the commencement of hostilities.2. You will be informed from time to time of the numbers of troops whichwill be placed at your disposal in order to carry out your mission, and in thisconnection you will understand that, owing to the number of different theatresin which we are employed, it may not always be possible to give the informationdefinitely a long time in advance.3. The defeat of the enemy by the combined Allied Armies must always be regarded as the primary object for which the British troops were originallysent to France, and to achieve that end the closest co-operation of French andBritish as a united Army must be the governing policy; but I wish You distinctlyto understand that your command is an independent one, and that you will&quot; inno case come under the orders of any Allied general further than the necessaryco-operation with our Allies above referred to.4.   If unforeseen circumstances should arise such as to compel our Expedi-tionary Force to retire, such a retirement should never be contemplated as anindependent move to secure the defence of the ports facing the Straits of Dover,although their security is a matter of great importance demanding that every effort should be made to prevent the lines which the Allied Forces now hold in Flandersbeing broken by the enemy.   The safety of the Channel will be decided by the overthrow of the German Armies rather than by the occupation by our troops of some defensive position with their backs to the sea.   In the event, therefore,of a retirement, the direction of the retreat should be decided, in conjunctionwith our Ally, with reference solely to the eventual defeat of the enemy andj not to the security of the Channel.  Notwithstanding the above, our ExpeditionaryI Force may be compelled to fall back upon the Channel ports, or the circumstancesj may be such that it will be strategically advantageous that, while acting inI co-operation with the French Army, it should carry out such a retirement.   The; requisite steps required to meet this contingency should therefore receiveattention.5. In minor operations you should be careful that your subordinates under-stand that risk of serious losses should only be taken where such risk isauthoritatively considered to be commensurate with the object in view.6.   You will kindly keep up constant communication with the War Office,and you will be good enough to inform me regarding all movements of the enemyj reported to you as well as those of the French Army.7. I am sure that you fully realise that you can rely with the utmostconfidence on the wholehearted and unswerving support of the Government, ofMyself, and of your compatriots.
The Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, British Armies in France.IN consequence of the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government in theappointment of General Foch as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces onthe Western Front, it has become necessary to modify in some respects theinstructions given to you in War Office letter No. 121/7711, dated the 28thDecember, 1915 :-(1) The general objects to be pursued by the British Armies in France remain the same as those set forth in the first and second paragraphs of that letter.(2) In pursuit of those objects you will carry out loyally any instructions issued to you by the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces. At the sametime, if any order given by him appears to you to imperil the British Army,it is agreed between the Allied Governments that you should be at liberty to appeal to the British Government before executing such order. While it ishoped that the necessity for such an appeal may seldom, if ever, arise, youwill not hesitate in cases of grave emergency to avail yourself of your rightto make it.(3) It is the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to keep the British forces under your command as far as possible together. If at any time the allied commander-in-Chief finds it necessary to transfer any portion of the Britishtroops to the French area in order to release French troops for purposes ofroulement, it should be distinctly understood that this is only a temporary arrangements, and that as soon as practicable the troops thus detached should bereunited to the main body of the British forces.(4) You will afford to the American troops forming part of the Allied armies in France such assistance in training, equipment or administrative matters asmay from time to time be required of you by the Commander-in-Chief of theAllied Forces.(5) Subject to any special directions you may receive from the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, the principles laid down in the fourth paragraph ofWar Office letter No. 121/7711 of the 28th December, 1915, are to be regarded asstill holding good.(6) The fifth, sixth and seventh paragraphs of that letter are maintained intheir entirety.MILNEE.War Office, S.W. 1,June   21, 1918.
