THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may .be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.- 1 copy no.n.O.S.  (59) 26.WAR CABINET.CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE.GERMAN OBSERVANCE OF. INTERNATIONAL LAW.(  S2&amp;8SgJP&amp;?.-rjftk, ,,CUXkfUjLS9JL.3g) -REPORT.1. It will he recalled that in our Report(CCS, (59)25) which was considered hy the WarCabinet at their Meeting&quot;&apos;&apos; on Wednesday,  the 15thSeptember, we stated that we should not be justifiedin saying that, so far, German armed ferces had notobserved the principles of warfare at sea, on theland or in the air.      There had, at ecurse, he anmistakes, and -casualties among the civil population in Poland due to inaseurate bombing.2. The War Cabinet were informed that enquirieshad been addressed by the German Government to ourselves and the french Government, through the medium of the Swiss and Swedish Governments, as toour respective attitudes in regard to methods ofair warfare.4   Also Paper No. &quot;.Y.P.   (59) 230+   W.Me(39) 14th LI tg., Minute 7.

3.      We were about to consider the above question when we   were placed in possession of Warsaw Telegrams Nos. 442&quot;1&quot;ana 445-^ dated the 11th and 12th. September respectively.  Inthe former Colonel Beck draws attention to the fact that duringthe past few days the Germans have adopted tactics of deliberateand indiscriminate bombing of open towns repeatedly during thesame day, with the obvious object of demoralising the civilian population,,    He goes on to state that he hassatisifed himself by personal inspection that bombs have been dropped in the middle of numerous   open towns where there couldnot be said to be any troops or important railway communications.In Telegram No0  445 our Ambassador in Warsaw corroborates thisevidence.4.     A German communique (Annex III) which has appeared into-day&apos;s   Press, may lend colour to the above evidence.    Thiscommunique appears to us to be intended to afford cover forthe bombardment of open towns, and villages, whilst attempting to retain the legal semblance of legitimate military objectives.5.      The position therefore,  as reported by us to the WarCabinet at yesterday&apos;s Meeting, may have changed.6.      The arrival of the Warsaw Telegrams made it clear to us that no good purpose would be served by confining our enquiry to the limited question referred to in paragraph 2 above, andwe have therefore addressed ourselves to the wider issue raisedby these Telegrams.?o     Prom the strictly military point of view we adhere to thepolicy which we recommended     and which the War Cabinet approvedFin our Report on the subject of Air Policy, namely:-(a) On balance it is our considered opinion that,at present, the military disadvantages ofinitiating extended air action definitelyoutweigh the possible advantages.+   Annex I. Annex II.+H- (Paper No.C.0. 8.(39)23 ? w. m. (39) 12th Conclusions,Also W.P.(39)19). Minute 6.-2-

(b) We should therefore adhere for thepresent  to our existing policy as laid down in the BombardmentInstructions.,(c) We should he prepared to exploit, asfar as possible, the situation arisingfrom the French offensive and tosupport ii as effectively asconditions will permit - consistent with not dissipating our bomberforces by their employment onineffective and uneconomicaltasks.8.. We are thus now faced with the wider question that,     if it were established beyond any shadow ofdp,doubt not only to our own satisfaction but alsoin the eyes of the world at large thai: Germany has,in fact, taken the gloves off in Poland, we may be forced, on political grounds,  to reconsider our policy as laid down in paragraph 7 above.9. The crux of the whole matter is to establish the truth.      All the evidence we have received sofar emanates from interested par-ti.ea._in. Poland andwould not-therefore-carp-y universal conviction.10.        It seems to us that the best way of arriving at the truth would be go address a confidentialenquiry to President Roosevelt not only in his capacity as the head of the most important neutral state,but also as the author of the appeal&quot;1&quot; which he ,addressed to the belligerents to refrain fromunrestricted air warfare.

11.     We therefore suggest that a secret and personal telegram should he sent to our Ambassador at Washington,with the least possible delay, asking if president roosevelt will take steps to establish the true ftctsof the case in Poland, and, if he is satisfied thatGermany has broken the pledge that she gave to refrain from unrestricted air warfare, to inform us accordingly.It would be necessary at the. same time to give the ambassador the fullest information v/ith regard to our policy.12.      This Telegram should, in our view, he so phrasedas not to commit us to any particular course of military action or to initiating such action at any particulartime.13.      In view of the fact that the Telegram will have serious military implications, we would ask that we mightbe allowed to collaborate in drafting it.14.     We v/ould emphasise the importance of the closestcollaboration with the French in any action which may betaken.(Signed)      C0L.No NEWALL,DUDLEY POUND.EDMUND IRONSIDE,richmond Terrace, S.W. ,14th September, 1939,

ANNEX IFROM POLAND.Decypher.      Sir H. Kennard (Krzemieniee).llth September9 1939,,Do 8o25 pom. llth September. 1939.Ro    8o03 a.mo    13th September., 1939.No, 442oIMMEDIATE,I saw Minister for Foreign Affairs today for the first time since our departure from Warsaw.      He drew my attentionto the fact that during the past three days Germans had adopted tactics of deliberate, and indiscriminate bombing of open towns repeatedly during the same day with the obvious object of demoralizing of the civil populationHe hads during the past two days, satisfied himself by personal inspection that bombs had been dropped in themiddle of numerous ^pen towns where there could not be saidto be any troops--or important railway communication.Under these circumstances he begged me that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would consider retaliation on german military objectivess such as factories engaged in war production.      Only reason that Polish army had found itimpossible successfully to withstand the German onslaughthad been the German superiority in.aircraft and theirmechanized units.      He thought that greater activity on

on the part of the British Air Force in the Vest would at once largely contribute to relieving the pressure.He felt sure if the German people realized that they werenot immune from such attack it would have a great effecton their morale.      He was very careful to avoid ill anyway criticising our attitude in this matter5 but appealedfor a more offensive spirit on the part of our aircraft which he felt would do more than anything else to ease the military situation here.

ANNEX    IIProm:      POLAND.Decypher.    Sir H. Kennard (Krzemieniec)c12th September, 1959,D.    2.00 p.m. 12th September, 1939,R.    9.30 a.m. 13th September, 1959.No. 445.My telegram No. 442.As an example of indiscriminate bombing this townwhich contains.&quot;, no military objective and is only the headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and CorpsDiplomatique, was deliberately bombed this morning with many casualties.

ANNEX III.REPORTED GERMAN COMMUNIQUE.Recently there has &quot;been an increase of cases inwhich Polish Government offIcials.and army officers have called on the population of open towns, villagesand hamlets to resist the entry of German troops.In Warsaw the civil population was incited &quot;by radio,leaflets and other proclamations to wage a &quot;franc-tireur&quot;(sniping)war.    The excessive consideration of theGerman artillery and airmen for open towns, hamlets or -villages was dependent on the condition that these places were not made a war zone by the enemy.As the Poles, without any regard to their ownpopulation, have rejected this condition,  the german armed forces will henceforth break resistance insuch places with all means at their disposal.The German air force, in co-operation with heavy artillery, will take all suitable measures to make clear the uselessness of resistance.    Only the PolishGovernment and their incompetent and unscrupulousarmy commanders can be held responsible for theconsequences which the sorely-tried civil population will staffer.

ANNEXIV.APPEAL BY PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT.1st September, 1939.The ruthless bombing from the air of civilians in unfortified centers of population during the course   .of the hostilities which have raged in various quarters of the earth during the past few years,  which has resultedin the maiming and in the death of thousands ofdefenceless&apos; men, women and children, has sickened thehearts of every civilized man and woman and has profoundlyshocked the conscience of humanity.      If resort is had tothis form of inhuman barbarism during the period of thetragic conflagration with which the world is now. confronted,hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings who have no responsibility for and who are not even remotely participat-ing in the hostilities which have now broken out will lose &quot;their lives.    I am therefore addressing this urgent appeal to every Government which may be engaged in hostilitiespublicly to affirm its determination that its armed forcesshrill in no event and. under no circumstances undertake thetbombardment from the air of civilian populations or ofunfortified cities, upon the- understanding that these sameinlles of warfare will be scrupulously observed by all theiroppdnents.I request an. immediate- reply.
