Weekly Report (iTOo2) of Air Operations and intelligence for the week ending midnight September 17th,1939.Reported Movements of German Bomber Squadrons.&apos; 1. Reports received from neutral sources tell ofadditions being made to the German concentration of long-range bombers in North-West Germany, and of impending air attacks against Great Britain,,    The telegrams which have been receivedfrom Copenhagen making reference to a concentration of Germanbomber squadrons on the island of Sylt may be considered astypical of these reports.Our own information does not at this time revealany movements of German air units from east to west, and thereports have possibly been inspired from German sources.German Air Operations in Poland.2, When the German Air Force was assured of an adequatemeasure of air superiority, consequent on its initial attacks onPolish aerodromes, aircraft factories, etc., the main air effort was concentrated against Polish communications.   German informa-tion about the movements of Polish Headquarters appears to havebeen accurate as the Headquarters were followed and attackedwhenever they moved.    This air action added greatly to thedifficulty of the Polish resistance because it kept Headquartersout of touch with the Polish Army Commands.By making attacks from low heights, the German AirForce Is reliably stated, during the land battles, to have broken up many Polish concentrations preparing to make counterattacks.Up to about the 11th September, the targets selected for attack by the German Air Force were probably those whichwould fall within the scope of the draft Rules of Air Warfaredrawn up at the Hague in 1923.    On the 13th September, instruc-tions were issued from German Headquarters which led to attacks on towns or villages offering resistance to the advance of the

of the German Armies, and even on civilian centres far outsidethe zone of the Armies.In general, all reports agree that the German domina-tion in the air has made a major contribution to the defeat ofthe Polish armies.Italian Air Forces3. No movements of importance have been detected, and reports show that the Italian squadrons are far from being at war strength.Dropping of Propaganda Leaflets.4. Only one propaganda dropping operation over germany was made during the week, namely on the night of the 10/llthSeptember0    One of the aeroplanes taking part was attacked at17,000 feet by three perman Fighters.    The gunner in the tailof the British aircraft opened fire.    The German attack was not -pressed home.Balloon Unit.     A small unit, to be employed for the despatchby balloon of propaganda matter into Germany, has been established in France.    The unit has been instructed to begin operationswhen the weather conditions are favourable.Photographic Reconnaissance..of Sylt.5. In connection with the reports referred to in para.lthat large numbers of bomber aircraft had been concentrated onthe island of Sylt, a Blenheim aircraft made a photographic reconnaissance of the island.   .The aircraft flew at 22,000 feet   Iwithout opposition either from enemy aircraft or anti-aircraft guns.   From such photographs as were obtained, it was concluded that no concentration of German bombers had, in fact, takenplace.Balloon Barrage.6* During a thunderstorm on the 15th September, 80balloons of the eastern part of the London barrage were brought [-downi 77 were struck by lightning and 3 were blown away. The feballoons destroyed were replaced within a few hours, and

arrangements have been made which will, it is hoped, obviatesuch losses in the future.,Coastal Command Act:^lties,y,- 7c Routine and special aircraft reconnaissance patrolsover the North Sea, and anti-submarine aircraft patrols continued;air escorts were provided for thirty-five convoys.Eleven submarines were sighted from the air and six of these were attacked;    it would appear that at least two of the attacks were successful.Owing to the growing menace from submarines in theWestern Approaches aircraft are being moved from northern and eastern stations to the west to permit of intensive anti-submarine patrols to cover the Western Approaches.    With the same object in view, one flying boat squadron has also been transferred fromthe Mediterranean to Pembroke Dock, and another from Malta to gibraltar.Advanced Air Striking Force.8* The ten Medium Bomber squadrons making up the firstechelon of the Advanced Air Striking Force are in France.    the squadrons are not yet up to full strength in personnel,mechanical transport, or equipment and are ready for operationsonly on a reduced scale.    The movements of the remainder ofthe first echelon, and of the relevant Army L. of C. units, are proceeding.The aerodromes intended for the second echelon of theA.A.S.F. have been taken over, and as an interim measure, withthe object of increasing dispersion, a part of the firstechelon has moved to these aerodromes.Pending a decision with regard to the despatch of thesecond echelon, operational units are at their mobilisationstations at home and they will be ready to move after the 30thSeptember.

In order to increase the facilities available onAdvanced Air Striking Force aerodromes for the refuelling of aircraft from the United Kingdom., three additional servicingflight sections have been sent to France;    there are now 8 ofthese sections in France0R.A.F. Component of the Field Force.9n        Certain advanced parties of the Field Force Componentunits have already arrived in France and have been making groundreconnaissances prior to &quot;che arrival of the main bodies.    Themain bodies have begun to move from their mobilisation stations and will sail for France within a few days.The Fighter Wing in France.10o The administrative arrangements for the Fighter Wing,made up of the four Hurricane squadrons which were deployednorth of the Seine to protect the ports of disembarkation ofthe Field Force and of the Advanced Air Striking Force, remain on a skeleton basis.    The fighters are accordingly capable only of operations by day, and on a limited scale.    The main bodieshave sailed and sh uld arrive by the 20th.
