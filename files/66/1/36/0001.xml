I.1,    The U-Boat attack on British trade has procuded a loss of 147,000ftons and 28 ships during the first fortnight of the war.     This is justlover half the rate in tonnage, but just under one-third in numbers ofthe peak period in April 1917.     We are now reaching the end of theperiod when our incoming ships are uncontrolled; and in less than a week from now practically all ships will arrive in convoy.       These convoysv/ill he protected in the approaches against anti-submarine attack, thoughfor some time the anti-submarine escorts will be weaker than desired.None the less considerable relief may be expected in this sphere; firstfrom the institution of the convoy system; secondly from the gradualgrowth of our anti U-Boat forces in the theatre; and thirdly by themounting of guns on all our vessels.     Meanwhile the asdic method isyielding good results and a serious toll has been exacted from theGerman U-Boats engaged.       All our measures will progressively increasein power.2.     The institution of convoys presents targets which may be foundmore tempting to the German armed merchant cruisers (of which we have as yet heard nothing), and also to a break out of their fast warshipsfrom the Baltic.        The First Lord does not believe that it would bein German interests to attempt this latter operation at the presenttime.      Nevertheless we are endeavouring to work up protection againstsurface attack for our convoys as fast as possible.      The only realProtection against a German sortiefrom the Baltic is the main fleet at Scapa Flow, with its cruiser and armed merchant-cruiser cordons now^ing developed, and stretching, first from the Orkneys to the Shetlands,secondly from the Shetlands to the Faroes, and thirdly from the Faroes toisland.     The Commander-in-Chief has in mind operations to countersuch sorties upon each of these three sectors, and it is believed thatQtice will be obtained from the various scouting forces and air patrols.3Se cordons at the same time examine the incoming trade to northern

Should a break-out occur it might be necessary to suspendtrans-Alantic traffic for a period on certain routes and to pursue the enemy warships with the strongest and fastest ships of H.M.Fleet.This would be a separate major Naval operation.g. Surveying the relative power of the surface fleets: theGermans have only seven ships worth considering,  to witthe two 26,000 ton battle cruisers &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and&quot;Gneisenau&quot;the three so-call pocket battleships, which are reallyill-constructed heavy cruisers and two excellent 10,000 ton 8&quot; gun cruisers.Nothing else of importance reaches them for at least six months tocome.     Meanwhile they are incapable of forming a line of battle whichcould face any one of three fleets which we could assemble.4. It therefore becomes possible for the Admiralty toconteraplate a major conflict for the control of the mediterranean in the event of Italy becoming hostile.      Should this occur, allmerchant traffic through the Mediterranean would be suspended until a decision had been reached.      Two British Capital Ship fleetswould be based upon Alexandria and gibraltar respectively, either ofwhich could encounter the main Italian Naval power.    This would notapply to the smaller vessels in which? while so many of our cruisers and&apos;destroyers are closely engaged against the U-Boats there is nosuperiority.      There is however the French fleet, which is in a highstate of efficiency and must be considered as very nearly equal to theItalian by itself.In the event of Italy becoming an enemy she would have graveneed of reinforcing and supplying Libya,  and opportunities for actionftight therefore be offered to the superior French and British Fleets,it is recognised that the securing of the command of the MediterraneanV/ould in the circumstances apprehended become the main objective oftoe royal Navy and their French allies.

5. We must expect serious recrudescence of the U-Boatwarfare during the summer and autumn of 1940,      In this case itwill probably range much further afield,  and this tendency isalready manifest.     Nevertheless, no doubt is felt that with thelarge measures of new construction now in progress,  and with the increasing discouragement of the U-Boat personnel under theirheavy punishment, this contingency can be fully dealt with.6. The use of the Air,  as an adjunct of the Fleet both for cruiser reconnaissance and in the anti U-Boat warfare, hasbecome a vital factor.      The Fleet Air Arm must be equipped and developed to - the highest stage of efficiency.      Its demands,though small comparatively,  cannot cede priority in any respect.7. The spirit of the merchant service shows that,  in spiteof quite heavy sinkings at the beginning;,  there will be noreluctance to proceed to sea and an increasing readiness to obeyAdmiralty instructions.    Special rewards for merchant men and officers for saving their ships from U-Boat attack are beingproposed,  and a chevron will be given to individuals  foreach time-of sinking by a U-boat.      The multiplication oftonnage becomes of the highest importance as it will be impossiblwholly to eliminate losses.      A standard merchant ship should be designed in which rapidity of construction should have precedenceover speed.      The specifications of this standard ship will be furnished shortly to the Board of Trade, by the Board ofAdmiralty,8. Every effort will be used to procure the highesteconomy in Naval administration,  and to aid the sister services.(Intld.)    W.S.C.Admiralty,  S.W.I.17th September,  1939.
