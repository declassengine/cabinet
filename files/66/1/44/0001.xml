S E    0   R   E   note FOR THE WAR CABINET ON CONVERSATION between mr. HORE-BELISHA, LORD HANKEY, M. DALADIER AND GENERAL GAMELININ PARIS 5 SEPTEMBER 20th10     A note of this conversation, which has been submittedto Mo Daladier, is attached.The following are notes for the information of the WarCabinet in amplification of the attached paper.2.     M. Daladier&apos;s strong appeal for the greatest and earliestpossible support by British Forces, referred to in paragraph (j)of the attached paper was made most graciously and without any suggestion of reproacho3.     Prior to the conversation with M. Daladier, Mr. Hore-Belisha and Lord Hankey met Lord Gort and discussed with him the subjects which they intended to cover in their conversationwith the French Prime Minister.The chief points which emerged from this discussion with lord Gort are summarised below.      It will be seen that allthese points were clarified in the subsequent conversationwith.M. Daladier.(a) Lord Gort was anxious to ensure that, if possible, his troops should have a few weeks, immediately after completingtheir concentration, in which they could carry out training.(b) At the same time he was anxious   to know without delay to what sector of the Franco-Belgian frontier defences theB.E.F. would be allotted.     At present he had only been told to interest himself in the sector between Maubeuge and the sea.It was important to know this in order to initiate reconnais-sances, to site field defences and to organise and begin thedigging of these defences.     The latter work could be carried out/concurrently ...

concurrently with the training-(c) He would like the B.E.F. to he allotted the sectorto the east and south of Lille for the following reasons(i)    The British L. of C, which would he 500miles in length if the B.E.F. were allotted certain other possible sectors, would he shortened by 50 miles.(ii)    If attacked the B.E.F. would have strong Frenchpositions in the Lille and Valenciennes areas on theirleft and right.(iii)    General Dill had carried out a tactical e xe rcisein this sector.      The country south of Lille is not sowaterlogged as country further west.      On the other hand it is one of the probable&apos; areas of German attack,(iv)    Arras would be a convenient site for G.H.Q.(d) Lord. Gort anticipated that the French would want the3.E.F. to hold a very wide front - perhaps something like 10or 12 kilometres to each division.     He felt that a division should not be called on to hold a. front of more than 5 or 6kilometres if liable to attack.(e) Although the French methods of siting their defenceswere not identical with ours, he anticipated that he would beable to adapt any existing French defence works to his own ideas(f) He felt it to be most important that every possible -measure should be taken to help him to develop the defenceson the allotted sector quickly.     Mechanical diggers should besent out.     He would welcome the help of French civilian labour.Rather than have units sent out for digging only, he would prefe:and strongly urged that lie should have more fighting units whichcould not only be used for digging but also if battle developed for the fighting line.     He would like all his infantry brigadesto be made up to n battalions instead of 3.      This would entail13 battalions ./(g)    He  ....

(g) He hoped that the French would raise no objections tothe use of Havre as a base port.(h) Lord Gort shared the objections of the C.I.G.S. to the project of allotting the B.E.F. to the sector on the Scheldtfrom AUDENARDE northwards.(i) He felt it to be most desirable that the Belgians, andif possible the Dutch, should blow up the frontier demolitions,which they have prepared now, instead of leaving them until theGerman advance began, when there would be no doubt about theirsuccessful execution.(j) Lord Gort was anxious that the B.E.F. should be re-info reed by 3 or k additional machine gun battalions as soon aspracticable .k.      On September 21st Mr. Hore-Belisha and Lord Hankey againsaw Lord Gort at the latter&apos;s Headquarters.     The ground covered in the conversations with M. Daladier on the previous day was explained to Lord Gort, who was thoroughly satisfied with theprogress which had been made.Lord Gort explained to the Secretary of State certainrequirements in engineering stores and special units which heurgently needed.      (These matters will be taken up in the WarOffice).Lord Gort emphasised the great importance of having a strongR.A.F.  component with the B.E.F., and the necessity for being able to switch fighters from the United Kingdom to France and vice versa, according to the day-to-day situation.The frontages which the B.E.F. might be called upon tohold on the Franco-Belgian frontier were discussed.      Some doubt was expressed as to whether the French could dispose sufficientdivisions to deploy on the Franco-Belgian frontier withoutcalling on divisions to hold wider fronts than would be desirable.The distance from LONGWY to the sea near Zeebrugge is about three hundred kilometres.      Taking an average frontage per/division ....

9 7division of ten kilometres, this would call for 30 divisions,or with an average of five kilometres, 60 divisions.     LordGort pointed out that in 1918, when we were facing heavyGerman attacks, we had some 62 divisions between the Oise andYpres, a frontage of about 12+0 kilometres.     These figures serve to show what large forces may eventually prove necessary onthis front.Lord Gort was anxious that the possibility of gettingadditional units over from England without waiting for thecompletion of the concentration of the present contingent ofthe B.E.E. should be examined.      It was suggested that this might be possible by using an additional port such as Havre.If a situation should ever develop in which the abandon-ment of the Belgian coast was forced on us, we must ensure thatthe ports are effectively blocked before being aba&amp;doaiecU.21st September, 1939.

secret note of a Conversation between M. Daladier, general gamelin, Mr, Hore-Belisha and Lord Hankey at theMinistry of &apos;War on September 20th.Mr. Hore Belisha and Lord Hankey saw M. Daladieralone.    At this preliminary discussion M.  Daladier agreed with all the points which were developed in the subsequentconversations.,30 p.m. General Dewing joined the conference.M. Daladier outlined the French position on the Franco-Belgian frontier, explaining the work now in progress,Spanish workers are being employed, but comparatively fewFrench civilians are available owing to mobilization and agricultural needs.    He emphasised that any assistance which the British could give, either by labour battalions,territorial units or mechanical diggers would be of great value.&apos;   The operations in Poland had. shown the importanceof fighting on prepared positions.There was a general discussion of the situation whichwould arise in the event of the Germans advancing throughHolland and Belgium,    Particular reference was made to .the project which had been put forward by General Gamelin of occupying a line on the Scheldt in which the british expeditionary Force might be allotted the sector Oudenarde-  \Northwards,    Mr. Hore Belisha explained the disadvantageswhich the British foresaw if the B.E.F.  were employed onthis sector, particularly with reference to the difficultiesof the maintenance of supplies.Mr. Hore Belisha explained the desirability of theB.E.F.  knowing early on what sector they might be expected tobe employed on the Franco-Belgian frontier as soon as the concentration of the B.E.F. was completed./Mr.  Daladier

Mr, Daladier expressed surprise that General Gort wasnot already aware of this sector.He emphasized more than once the importance of hurryingon the concentration of the B.E.F.. from a psychological and propaganda point of view.    The sooner they were seen in theneighbourhood of the front the &quot;better from this point of view.M. Baladier had thought of wirting to the Prime Minister tosay how strong German propaganda was to the effect that theBritish, having landed the French in the war, were leaving theFrench to do the fighting.. m. General Gamelin arrived.In the course of a long discussion General Gamelinmade the following points :-(a) He regards the concentration by the Germans of sufficient forces to make a wide advance through theLow Countries as a serious possibility.    He estimates that an attack of this sort might be launched about threeweeks after the withdrawal of German formations from thePolish front was commenced.    He had no information thatany such withdrawal had yet commenced.(b) Without previous conversations with the Belgians itwould not be possible to employ important French forces inco-operation with the Belgian defence on their lineAlbert Canal-Meuse.    He had determined to avoid anencounter battle in the centre of Belgium.    On the otherhand he would not hesitate to establish &quot;points d&apos;appui&quot;on Belgian soil in advance of his main position on the franco-Belgian frontier.(c) General Gamelin was shown a telegram sent by HisMajesty&apos;s Government to Brussels.    He thoroughlyapproved of it and,  In subsequent discussion of thepossibilities if the Belgians entered into conversation,he made it clear that given time for proper preparation

he would certainly contemplate moving appreciable french forces into Belgium to co-operate with the defence ofthe line Albert Canal-Meuse.M. Daladier had also seen, this telegram and agreedthat we should carry out the negotiations with the belgians, keeping him informed.Both M. Daladier and General Gamelin recognised the importance of guarding the secrecy of this telegram.(d) Both M. Daladier and General Gamelin favoured theidea of pressing the Belgians and, if possible, theDutch to carry out the essential demolitions on theirfrontier without waiting for German concentrationsthreatening an advance through the Low Countries.M.  Daladier had already informed us that he had told the Americans that the Dutch demolitions ought to he carried out without delay, and he had. reason to believethat this would be passed on.(e) General Gamelin considered it possible that thedelay which the Belgians could, impose upon a german advance through Belgium might give sufficient time forthe occupation by the allies of the line of the Scheldtwith the object of enabling the remnants of the Belgianforces to withdraw to a secure position and. of covering the ports on the Belgian coast.    lie had a project in his mind for such action on the Scheldt which he wouldimplement if he judged the situation would afford himenough time to carry it out successfully.(f) Although he did not entirely share our views on themaintenance difficulties on the British side: in theevent of the 3.3.F.  holding a sector of the Scheldt line,General Gamelin in no way pressed for the employment ofthe  I.E.F.   on the Scheldt and said that if this projectwere adopted he would employ French troops.---/(g)

(g) Although it was agreed that it was important thatthe B,-E. F.  should have facilities for a period of training as soon as their concentration was complete, it was nevertheless important that the sector on the Franco-Belgian front to which it would, he allotted should hesettled without delay.    General Gamelin saw no difficultyin allotting the British a sector immediately South ofLille with G.Hi      near Arras, and he promised to put this to General Georges, leaving the details to he settledbetween him and Lord Gort;(h) General Gamelin saw no difficulties in ourtransferring our base to Le Havre after the concentration of our first four divisions had been completed.(i) Mr. Hore Belisha said that Lord Gort had visualisedsomething in the order of 5 km. per division occupyinga sector on the frontier.    General Gamelin, on the otherhand contemplated sectors on this line being occupiedinitially on the basis of about 10 km. per division. he emphasised that the 3.E.. F. would be supplemented by theFrench garrisons holding the permanent works.    He also saidthat of course if a situation developed in which theenemy was concentrating the artillery necessary for a heavy attack, the frontage he had mentioned would be   -materially decreased.    The question Tras left as being one for settlement between General Georges and Lord Gort.(j)    Asked whether he feared a German sweep throughthe Low Countries in the near future, General Gamelinmade it clear that it was a contingency which he regard-ed seriously and,  though he had every hope of having timeto complete his deployment in a manner calculated tohold the German advance on the Franco-Belgian frontiera serious situation might well develop.    Both M.  Daladierand General Gamelin made strong appeals for the greatestand earliest support possible by British forces,/(k)

(k)   Both M. Daladier and General Gamelin entirelyagreed with the absolute necessity, in the event ofa German sweep through the Low Countries, of the mostdrastic allied air action against German columnsmoving through Belgium.(l) General Gamelin emphasised his need for moreBritish fighter aircraft in France.    Mr.  Hore Belishapromised to communicate this request to the British   vGovernment, though he was unable to make any promiseon the point.(m)    Asked how many divisions he thought the germans might have to leave on the Polish front now that theRussians had entered from the East, General Gamelinsaid?  at least twenty.(n)    General Gamelin said that the arrangements forliaison were working satisfactorily.Mr. Hore-Belisha assured !&apos;;. Daladier and General Gamelinthat, while he could not speak in terms of numbers of british divisions in France, or of the proportion between the three fighting Services, the effort to be made by Great Britain inthis war would be the maximum possible and that it would in total not be less than that of 1918.Paris,20th September, 1939.
