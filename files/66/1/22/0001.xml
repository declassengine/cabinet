In peace time German requirements are taken by sea, but it is considered that the inland communications,including the Danube, would be just sufficient to carryGermanyfs war time requirements,, -   In addition to Roumania&apos;output, therefore, the question of transport to germany is a vital factor.4e The war Office, as a result of their investigations,reconnaissanceon the spot and contact with the british minister and the Oil Companies in Roumania, have submitted the attached proposals.55i-j.   Annex I.

5o        In my capacity as Chairman of the Oil Board, Iassembled a suitable Conference, as a matter of urgency,to consider these proposals.     Those attending the meetingincluded the Deputy Chiefs of Staff, the Representativesof Service Departments who have been studying the question in Roumania and Sir Andre?/ Agnew, Chairman of the Pool Board.Our conclusions are attached as Annex II.(Intdo)    W.S.M.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.-,11th September, 19390

ANNEX      I.PLAIT TO MINIMISE OIL EXPORT TO GERMANY FROM A NEUTRAL RQUMANIA.(1) A meeting to discuss measures to be taken toeurtail the supply of Roumanian oil to Germany washeld at BUCHAREST on 6th September, 1939.      Thefollowing were present;-Sir Reginald Hoare*Representative from. Astra Romana Oil Co.        !&quot; &quot;   Steaua Romana Oil Co.&quot; ,(    Unirea Oil Co.Li eut.-C commander Wat s on.(S) Representatives from the oil companies statedthat they were reducing their output as far as possible,but that this reduction would only amount to 20,000tons per month for all three companies,,     germany had placed large orders with them during the last few months and unless contracts were placed by otherbuyers they would not be in a position to refuse   &apos; \^further German demands,(3) With the closing of the all sea route, germany would require as many barges and tank cars as she could get hold of, in addition to her own fleets.It is believed that barges of the following companiescould be acquired - Y.R.P.   (Yugo-slav), N.F.R.  andS.R.D.  (Roumanian).      As to tank cars,  there arecertain to be a number that could be chartered.(4)       Action already^ taken.(a) Enquiries are being made as to what bargesare available for charter.(b) Enquiries are being made as to what railtank cars are available for charter.

f Q9Jl C&apos;(c) Production of oil is being reduced bythe above three companies (Astra,Steaua and Unirea).(d) The French Company, Colombia, is being asked to co-operate on similar lines.(e) Unirea Company are holding up supply of oil to Germany already contracted for.(5)      Action urgently required.(The urgency lies in the fact that germany will step in if we do not act immediately).(a) The placing of contracts v/ith oil companies in Roumania for all available oil, bothin stock and future production.(b) A British agent in Roumania to be authorisedto charter all available barges on the danube.(c) A British agent in Roumania be authorisedto charter all available rail tankcars in Roumania.The British Minister at Bucharest can initiateaction in accordance v/ith (b) and (c) above as soonas he receives approval.The placing of contracts and arrangements forthe removal of the oil from Constanza should bemade from London.M.I. (R).11th September, 1939.

CONCLUSIONS(a) From the strictly military point of view the arguments for purchasing all surplusoil stocks in Rumania, and for placingcontracts for all surplus output for thenext six months which might othemvise goto Germany are decisive.(b) The oil could he used in this country:it1s purchase might disturb-our Iraneanand Venezueliau contracts but there -arepossibilities of disposal elsewhere.(c) From the exchange point of view there wouldbe no objections to such a transactionprovided that payment was in blockedsterling.(d) No tanker difficulty is anticipated.(e) The conference express no view on the broader question of whether these&quot;spoilingtactics5&apos;are likely to lead to Germanywalking into Rumania and. helping herself jor on the effect that they are likely tohave on the general attitude of the rumanian Government.(f) The British Minister at Bucharest shouldbe authorised to charter.j3.ll availablebarges on the Danube,  &quot;/this will probablyamount to only twenty barges of sixhundred to eight hundred tons at a totalcost of  10,000 per three months^/(g) The British Minister at Bucharest should beatithorised to charter all available railtank cars in Rumania.(h) It was considered of importance that theMinister should have technical assistancein carrying out the instructions referredto in conclusion (f) and (g) above; to&quot;be arranged &quot;by the Treasury in consultationwith the Mines Department.(i) The time factor is all important.
