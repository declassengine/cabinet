ere much lower than in 1918.     If there is no moreextravagance in outlay now than there was thens every  .spent should produce better value,(b) Dollar -position.I wouia impress on my colleagues the reality of thedanger of a shortage of exchange resources.     We startedthe war of 1914/18 with greater resources actual and potential than we have today.In less than three years those resourcew were infact exhaustedg and at the time of the entry of the UnitedStates into the War in March 1917 we had no dollars left.TJaat is not to say that without the United States weshould have stopped fighting,, but the absence of essential supplies would have reduced the war effort of ourselves andour allies so perilously that it might well have robbedus of victory.Eighteen months ago this country possessed gold(at 168/- an ounce)    to a value of  ls,000s000s000.     Atthe outbreak of war it was down to  4505000,000.     Byrequisitioning securities etc.s we can bring it back tosay  700500090009 but that  700s000s000 has got to last us for three years of war if the war lasts so iongcI need not assure my colleagues that I do not setout these figures from any view that anything but themaximum effort is required - indeed3 that effort must begreaters and probably far greater than the effort of 1918.-but merely to show what is the relation between financialpossibilities and the programmes under discussion.(Infia)   J.S.Chambers 91st September j 1939.

ANNEX cMEMORANDUM PREPARED IN THE TREASURY.1. The Report of the Land Forces Committeerecommends that our aim should he the maximum concertedeffort of which the country is capable, which should ofcourse be in no way less than that made in 1918,     Thisproposition may &quot;be readily accepted, and indeed it is: expressed in different words in the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement to the house of Commons on Wednesday, (20thSept emberr  Col.981),20 In any comparison with 1913,,the contrast in theman-power needed     to equip and maintain in the field(or in the air)  the fighting individual    cannot be overlooked,      The efforts involved by war cannot be measured with precision by the actual money cost butit is the only test available.      The money cost of war has prodigiously increased since 191^-18 and theexpenditure per man bears no relation to the experience ofthat war.     From such rough calculations as can be made it appears to be from twice to three times as high.If the expense of equipping and maintaining our forces perman had been in 191J+-18 what is contemplated now, we shouldhave been utterly incapable of maintaining in the field the armies we actually did employ.3. In 191^-18 our rate of expenditure, commencinglow,  increased steadily throughout the war.      During1915 it was about  120 millions a month.     From April1918 the expenditure out of our internal resources (that

is, excluding financial assistance of roughly  50 millions a month from the United States) touched&quot; 200 millions amonth.      It follows that, the national income at that time&quot;being some  5000 millions, we had succeeded at the supremecrisis in mobilising a little less than half of thenational income for the service of the State.Prices were extremely high, wholesale prices in1918 &quot;being more than twice as high as at the present time.:A sum of  200 millions a month represented in purchasingpower (i.e.  in quantity and quality of equipment) onlya fraction of what it represents at present.l\.0 We are therefore starting this war where the otherleft  off. -    Before war broke out we were spending  120millions a month and the additional expense due to thewar will be at least  270 millions in the first threemonths, i.e.  210 per month.      Some part may be found non-recurrent as being incidental to the inauguration of controls, but we are clearly about the  200 million per month mark.     This is already a little over half of thenational income (taken at about  if.,750 millions).     Withthe additions proposed for the Army and Air Porce our expenditure will rise to at least  275 millions a month( 3300 millions a year) or 70 per cent of the presentnational income.      The national income will expand asprices rise but so will cur expenditure for the very same reason.      So far as .we have unemployed resotirces thenational income may rise rather the faster which would reduce the proportion somewhat below 70 per cent, but against this must be set the fact that estimates of war expenditure invariably prove much too low.35 Statist inde:; of wholesale prices:    1918 (average)227.1, 1939 June 106.6.-2-

The Air Force addition amount a to some  13millions a month and the increase in the Army to 67millions a month05* The ahove analysis goes to show that if theproposed extended programme were put into effect, thiswould not he attaining the level of our supreme effort in 1918 (for this is already reached) hut would involveso large an extra burden as is inconsistent with theidea of a three years war.6. Apart from drafts on its national income a country can have no resources to wage war except(l) help from outside,  (2) a reduction in its capital resources such as the exhauston of its stocks of goods, orthe letting down of its equipment.      The second resourceis not very important and is especially perilous for an island powero7* The result of spending much faster than moneycan be obtained by genuine means is unchecked inflationwhich like a drug gives temporary relief but leads before long to the currency losing all purchasing power at homeand abroad.

8. The collapse of the external purchasing power ofthe currency can he staved off by exchange control, solong as our exchange resources last.      These amount to approximately  700 millions.      If we are to last out athree-years war, we cannot draw on this fund at a greaterrate than  200 millions a year as we still have hankingdebts of about  100 millions to foreign countries.9. The exchange question is essentially one of dollars but there are a certain number of other difficultcurrencies.     By severe rationing, civilian demands onthese currencies for food, oil, raw materials and a fewessential manufactures might be kept to  250 millions ayear.      If we can maintain a substantial proportion ofour exports to these countries - which depends on labourbeing available - we might, allowing for very considerablehelp from the Empire, be able to face this without adraft on our reserves.Thus the burden on our exchange resources isequal to the expenditure in difficult currencies for defence.10. .      The Admiralty demands on our exchange resources for the first year are  hi), millions (or  h9i? millions ifthe Mediterranean is shut to oil transport).     This ismostly for ships and part of the rest is non recurrent.The programme has not been agreed and it seems impossibleto estimate for future years.

llo Advances in gold or free exchange to Turkey,Poland etc. are a direct loss.12. On the &quot;basis of 20 Divisions, all engaged not later than the end of the first year of war and of an air Force based on the production of 2,000 aircx-aft amonth, the requirements of the Army, Air Force and ministry of Supply (excluding civilian demands) appearto be of the order of llj-O millions First year, 180 millions in subsequent years.13. To provide for an Air Force based on theproduction of 2 ,,550 aircraft a month would add roughly 35 millions in each year, allowing for consequential increases in the demands of the Ministry of Supply,II).. The cost cf providing additional Army divisionsis much more difficult to estimate.     The limits of or;rhome productive capacity in important lines would bereached long before any high number of extra divisions had been attained and thereafter all further requirementwould have to be obtained from North America,The additional expense in the difficultcurrencies can only be roughly estimated as follows.

c3 t? ei15*        The cost of an additional 12 divisions (raising the total to 32 divisions at the end of the second year)appears to be of the order of 10 millions First year 25 millions Second year 75 millions Subsequent years16. The additional cost of providing for another 23divisions raising the 32 to 55 at the end of the second year appears to be of the order off first year  15 millionsSecond year  60 millionsThird year      150 millions.

3^ii rj 117.      The following is a summary of the exchange requirements in the difficult cuxronc jto shown above, so far as they canbe guessed at present:-First year   Second year   Third year  m   m     mCivil requirementsleBS exports, etc -(paragraph 9 j.A&amp;mi r alty:    roundfigures:   problema- 50tical (paragraph 10).SO Dlvifftonuy 2,000aircraft,  ^paragraph       140 180 18018 ) aExtra 560 aircraft,making 2,550 35 55 35(p ar agr aph 15) *Extra 12 Divisions,making 52 (Paragraph        10 25 &quot;7516).Extra 23 Divisions,making 65 (paragraph        15                   60 15016). .__.Total    ..    ..    . ,    o o        250 300 440

18,       All the figures above must be taken as roughguesses of the amounts and probably the minimumamounts involved.     Two causes will swell them9 namely(l) that   estimates of the supplies required forwar invariably prove in practice to have been much too lowj(S) that   prices are certain to rise rapidly.The priceoof wholesale primary commodities inthe United States has already jumped overSO per cent and there is no knowing where theywill get to if the war is prolonged.As some set-off to these is the fact that some15 per cento of the expenditure is in Frenchfrancs which is perhaps not as full a drain on our resources.      It depends on what we givethe French in return,19S       The conclusions seem to be that taking the existingbasis of 20 Divisions and 2S000 aircraft our exchange resources, subject to the important reservations in thepreceding paragraph, would carry through three years., thatthe extra 550 aircraft might still be met within the limits of our resources, but that 12 extra divisions wouldexhaust our resources before the end of the third year,A further 23 divisions would have brought our resourcesvery low by the end of the second year.
