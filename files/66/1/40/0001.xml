Printed for the War Cabinet.  September 1939. &quot;SECRET. . &quot; &apos;. . Copy No.W.P. (39) 40.WAR CABINET.NEGOTIATIONS  WITH  TURKEY  FOR  ANGLO-FRANCO-turkish treaty.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.As my colleagues are aware, agreement with the Turkish Government on financial questions has not yet been reached. The conversations with the TurkishGovernment have, however, resulted in agreement on the wording for the politicaltreaty. In order that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Angora may be in a positionto sign this immediately agreement has been reached with the Turkish Govern-ment on the other points, I circulate the text of the treaty for approval herewith.2. I should explain that it has been agreed that the Tripartite Treaty shouldbe in French; the French text, which will accordingly be the substantive text,is attached (Annex I), together with an English translation (Annex II).3. There have been a number of changes made to the draft which I circulated in a memorandum [F.P. (36) 101] of the 29th July; a copy of thedraft as it then stood is therefore also attached for convenience of reference(Annex III).4. The draft treaty is now in the form of an agreement between Heads of states, instead of^between Governments. The changes to which I would draw attention are the following :; (i) Article 1 has become Article 2; the wording has, however, been preserved.(ii) Article 2 has been divided into two parts, the first paragraph becoming-Article 1, and the second Article 4. It will be recalled that at the meeting ofthe Foreign Policy Committee on the 1st August [F.P. (36) 60th Meeting] it wasagreed that if the Turkish Government rejected the full reciprocity provided forin the draft of the then Article 2, we should not insist on the second paragraphof this Article if our doing so would involve a breakdown in the negotiations.It has not proved necessary to omit the second paragraph altogether, but it willbe noted that the Turkish Government have insisted on watering down its provisions, so that only consultation is now provided for in the event of theUnited Kingdom and France being involved in hostilities as a result of a directaggression against either by a European Power. The Turkish Government haveinsisted on a further addition, providing that in such an eventuality Turkeywill at least preserve a benevolent neutrality towards the United Kingdom andFrance. I do not much like this addition, but I think we must accept the articleas it now stands. The only reason why provision should be made for thiseventuality is that the treaty is to run without a break for 15 years.(iii) Articles 8 and 4 remain the same, though now numbered 3 and 5.(iv) Article 5 was designed to except the case of aggression by Russia, Turkeywaving from the outset of the negotiations declined to accept any undertaking togo to war with that country. The point is now provided for in the secondprotocol of the treaty, which will be kept confidential, and which is discussedbelow.(v) Article 6 remains the same, with the omission of a reference to theLeague of Nations, which omission has also been made in the preamble.[20016] b
(vi) The old Article 7 has been omitted; the present Article 7 has been inserted at the request of the Turkish Government, and is designed to emphasise that though the treaty is tripartite, it is equally binding as a bilateral treaty between Turkey and the United Kingdom and between Turkey and France.(vii) A new Article 8 has been inserted to provide against the conclusion of separate peace. The intention of this article is to cover the case in which Russiaentered a war as an enemy, in which, war Turkey was already fighting as an allyon our side. In such a case, though. Turkey would have no obligation to fight against Russia (in accordance with the exception provided for in Protocol 2), her obligations under the rest of the treaty would continue in effect. Thus if Turkeyhad already come into the war on our side, say as a result of German aggression against Roumania, her obligations to assist us would continue even if Russia wereto join Germany in the attack.(viii) Article 9 provides for the period of the treaty. I would draw attentionto the fact that it proved quite impossible to induce the Turkish Government toagree either to a shorter period than 15 years, or to a provision for denunciationduring this period. This is a long period, but the point was clearly one to whichthe Turkish Government attached the greatest importance, and I felt obliged to defer to. their insistence in order to avoid prejudicing the negotiations on theother points.(ix) The first protocol is designed to ensure that the obligations of the treaty shall come into effect immediately on signature, before ratification. It will bepublished integral part of the treaty.(x) The second protocol (which will be kept confidential: and will hot bepublished with the rest of the treaty) covers the point of the Turkish Government,to which we had to defer from the beginning of the negotiations, that she could undertake no obligation involving her in hostilities with Russia.(xi) Finally, there is an exchange of notes, which will also be keptconfidential. As I explained in the paper which I circulated on the 29th July[F.P. (36), 101], the Turkish Government have throughout endeavoured to obtainthe insertion in the treaty itself of a provision for assistance to Turkey in theevent of any &apos;&apos; act of aggression aimed at Turkish territories or leading to a warin such a way as to be considered by Turkey as likely to threaten her security.&quot;The object behind this was, of course, a desire on the part of Turkey to protectherself in the case of aggression started by Germany, which, she felt, mighthave as its ultimate object an attack on Turkey. After lengthy negotiations theTurkish Government have put forward as their last word a text for notes to beaddressed to them by the British and French Ministers which is quoted at theend of the Treaty. It will be seen that the obligation which we thus incur is tocome to the assistance of Turkey, if she so requests, as soon as military actionstarted by a European power reaches the frontiers of Bulgaria or Greece. Iendeavoured to obtain the insertion of a second paragraph, making the cominginto force of the obligation of mutual assistance conditional either on (a) an understanding that Turkey would not take the initiative in any precautionary measures involving the occupation of the territory of another country without prior agreement with us and the French, or (b) clear evidence at the time that the objective of the German forces was to attack Turkey or Greece. The TurkishGovernment have declined to accept either of these conditions, and I feel thatwe have no alternative but to give way. In practice acceptance of the Turkishtext means that in the event of Yugoslavia being occupied by Germany up to itssouthern or eastern frontiers we should have to grant immediate assistance to turkey; this might well mean that we should have, among other things, to considerthe despatch of a force to Salonika. I should add that I put the points involved inthis text before the Chiefs of Staff who, while agreeing with me that there wererisks inherent in accepting such an obligation over a period of 15 years, felt thatif the Turkish Government were insistent we must give way. This situation has now arisen and I fear that any attempt to modify the wording now underdiscussion would prejudice the conclusion of the Treaty.5. If, in the light of the above explanations, the present draft of the treaty is approved, I will immediately inform His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador by telegraph,so that he will have proper authority to sign the moment the Turkish Governmentdeclare that they are ready.September 20, 1939.H.
