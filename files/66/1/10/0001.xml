(39)1Q.copy no, &amp;*/war cabinet.evacuation op government departments.Note by Minister of Home Security.At the Sixth Meeting of the War Cabinet on the 6thSeptember, 1939,  it was recommended that arrangements should be made to begin,  as quickly as possible and inadvance of the general evacuation of GovernmentDepartments, the transfer of a limited number of departmental staffs, of which the Supply Organisation ofthe Air Ministry was an outstanding example;    and that the selection of these staffs should be considered at once byan Interdepartmental Committee which would settle thedetails on a basis of priority (W.m.(39) 6th Conclusions^Minute 2).This Committee met to-day and reached thefollowing conclusions(l)     That the Departmental staffs which should be moved first were some 3,000 Air Ministry staff fromBerkeley Square to Harrogate and 4,000 Admiralty staff toBiath,  since these staffs which were essential for warwork could function if moved away from London,1    (2)     That some 1,500 Ministry of Supply staff fromWoolwich should also be moved in advance of general

evacuation as thet-e also could function away from the restof the Ministry and their present location was unsatisfactory.(3)     That it would probably be desirable if arrangements could be made without breaking the wholeevacuation plan for the Supply Branch of the Ministry of\Home Security, the Health Insurance Branch of theI(Ministry of Health and a large portion of the Ministry of/Pensions staff to be moved in advance of the general evacuation of Government Departments.(4)     That none of the above moves should he orderedbefore the Office of Works and Ministry of Healthreported that the local arrangements had reached asufficient stage of preparation.The Committee .also recommended:-(A) that the Office of Works should not carry out any A.R.P. work  in the towns to which evacuation wouldtake place until all requisitioning arrangements havebeen completed;(B) that all Departments should be informed thatthey could only expect very rough office accommodation in the requisitioned buildings and would have to makethe best of what was actually there, and that the same position applied to billets;(C) that as considerable disturbance would he causedover a wide area today by these requisitioning arrangements,the Ministry of Information should be consulted as regardsthe action to be taken  with regard to the censorship ofLocal press, and the issue of a communique on the position;(D) that a short communique should be sent by theMinistry of Home Security to the Regional Commissionersinforming them of the position.The Committee also agreed that the situation

would want constant watching and would.he reconsideredfrom time to time, as information of the position camsin from the Office of Works and the Ministry of Healths&apos;I concur in the conclusions reached hy theCommittee and suggest that the way is now clear for theWar Cabinet to decides-(a)     Whether the staffs specified in (l) ahove should move as soon as the necessary arrangements can he completed, and(d)     Whether the movement of other staffs withinthe terms of paragraphs (2) and (3) ahoveshould taive place as soon as practicableon the authority of the Treasury and the-.Minister directly concerned or whetherspecific authority should be obtained,from the War Cahingt in each case as itarises.(Intld) J.A.^ Terrace, s.w.1.$ September, 1939,
