The salient points in the Delegation&apos;s Report are dealt with in the com-mentary, and these are mainly of an informative character. It will be noted thatthe Deputy Chiefs of Staff form the opinion that the. Poles tend to underrate theGerman strength, and overrate their own (paragraphs 9 and 14).8. With regard to air operations, the Deputy Chiefs of Staff show theimportance of ensuring that an agreed policy is concerted with the Poles as to airobjectives (paragraph 17). It would, for example, be disastrous if the Polesattacked Berlin before Germany had shown her hand.4. In paragraph 19, the Deputy Chiefs of Staff recommend that discussions should be initiated with the Polish Staffs, with regard to operating a certainnumber of our bombers from Polish aerodromes and, if the conversations are satisfactory, that the Air Ministry should be authorised to despatch stocks of bombs and maintenance stores to Poland.5. The question of further Staff contacts and the possibility of including theFrench, referred to in paragraph 22 of the commentary, is being taken up with thePoles by General Ironside during his visit to Warsaw.(jui-itiaiieu) u.Richmond Terrace, S.

[D.C.O.S. 127,]ENCLOSURE No. I.Anglo-Polish Staff Conversations.REPORT BY THE UNITED KINGDOM DELEGATION.Commentary by the Deputy Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.WE have examined the report of the British Delegation to Poland on their recent conversations with the Polish Staff * and have the following comments tomake: Political (paragraphs 4-8 of the Report).2. The Polish views on the probable alignment of the Powers differ from ourown only in respect of Hungary, whom they credit with the intention of resistingany exploitation by Germany. In our view the attitude of Hungary is likely tobe dictated by the facts of the military situation rather than by the sentimentsof the Hungarian people or their rulers. The only hope of getting Hungary to resist is that she should be assured beforehand of a united Balkan bloc behind her.This seems impossible unless Bulgaria can be induced to line up with Turkey andBoumania.3. At the time of the conversations the Polish attitude to Russia appearedto be growing less intransigent than formerly, but we might perhaps impress upon the Poles again, when the opportunity occurs, that Russia is likely to bethe only source from which they will be able to augment their own military resources in the event of war against Germany.4. The provisional assurance of our support in the event of an attack onLithuania which has been given by the Head of the Delegation (paragraph 8 ofthe report) is, of course, not satisfactory, and this point has been referred to theForeign Office.Strategical.5. The Poles are convinced that the Germans will, at the beginning of thewar, concentrate asrainst Poland, remaining on the defensive elsewhere. Theyhave consequently based all their plans on this conception, which is to them the&quot; worst case,&quot; and appear to have considered no alternative. Although we agreethat this is the most probable German course of action we suggest the Poles oughtto be asked to consider the possibility that the weight of German attack in theEast might be directed on Roumania instead of Poland. We feel that there areeconomic reasons which might force the Germans to adopt this course of action... 6. As regards this, the Poles have not co-ordinated with the Roumanians thedefence of their two countries against German attack, since the Polish-Roumanianalliance operates in practice only in the contingency of a Russian attack. ThePoles give as their reasons for this omission : - (a) That Hungary would not dare attack Roumania nor allow German troops to pass through to do so.   (Paragraph 4 of the Report.)(5) That any German attack on Roumania would be open to a Polish counter-attack from the north-west flank, and that Germany would not there-fore attack Roumania before she had dealt with Poland.(Paragraph 6 of the Report.)* Enclosure No. II.[19657] n
7. We are unable to accept these arguments as valid. A German attack onRoumania through Hungary seems quite a probability and it would be protectedon the northern flank by the Carpathians. Consequently, any Polish counter-attack would meet with considerable difficulties. We recommend that the importance ofdefence collaboration against Germany should be urged upon both the Poles and the roumanians. Such collaboration is essential if a solid front is to be formed inthe East against German aggression.Comparison of Forces. , (Paragraphs 11-14 and Annexes I and II.)8. The Polish conversations have not added materially to our knowledge ofthe military strengths of probable belligerents.In general their estimate of the strength of the German Army agrees withours, except as regards reserve divisions. The Poles estimate that the Germanscan mobilise 28-30 Reserve Divisions whereas our estimate gives the same figurewithout taking into account Czech equipment. The Polish estimate of theGerman first-line air strength is slightly lower than ours.9. The Polish view of their ability to resist Germany depends to a largeextent upoh their assessment of the fighting value of the German land forces which they place much lower than we do, and which is set out at sonic length in paragraph 25 of the Report. The War Office do not agree that the standardof training in the German forces is low and they consider that the efficiency of the mechanised units has been greatly improved since the time when Austriawas occupied.In general, therefore, we are of the opinion that the Poles tend to under-rate the German strength and over-rate their own.Course of Operations.(Paragraphs 11-27 and Annex III.)Naval.10. Annex III deals with the naval aspect of operations and we are ingeneral agreement with the views expressed. We do notT however, agree that german naval attack on the coast is likely. (Paragraph 14.) Germany willmore probably rely on land operations to make Polish naval bases useless.It will be seen (paragraph 8 (i), Annex III) that the Polish naval plan is based upon the assumption that help will be available as a naval base. Wethink this is a very optimistic assumption if only on account of the heavy scale of air attack which the Germans could bring to bear at short ranges.From paragraphs 20 and 21 of the Report it is clear that the General Staffdo not expect to be able to cover help for long, and consequently unless russia is an ally, the Polish naval forces will sooner or later be faced with the alternative of internment or running for the North Sea.11. The Poles anticipate that Germany will transport certain troops through the Baltic from the neighbourhood of Hamburg to East Prussia, and they attach considerable importance to making plans for attacking any militarytransports. As the Polish Plan is to give up the corridor, this is most unlikely.The Poles have been informed that British Naval action in the Baltic would be confined to submarine raids. These could not be undertaken at the beginningof the war, which is the most important time for Poland, unless submarines couldbe stationed in the Baltic before the outbreak of war. Any submarines that couldbe made available for this duty would have to be taken from other duties andtheir activities would cease soon after the Polish bases had been destroyed. Thepresence of British submarines might have a value in making Germany concentratein the Baltic greater anti-submarine forces than would be expected against Polishsubmarines alone. The operation of submarines through the Send or Belts after an outbreak of war may be extremely difficult and of doubtful value, owing to thesmall effect that these submarines are likely to produce.12.   We note that the Poles have asked for monitors to assist in the defenceof help.  We do not recommend the employment of monitors for this purpose andin any case, none are available.
German Offensive in the East.18. -We have already remarked that a German offensive directed againstRoumania does not appear to have been considered. As regards the offensive against Poland, the Polish estimate of the German distribution of troops (inparagraph 15) allots some 10 divisions less to the defensive force in the West than our estimate, and correspondingly increases the striking force in the East.14. In paragraph 17 of the report, the possibility is mentioned that a Corpsmay be transported from Hamburg by sea to East Prussia, to co-operate with a major advance from Pomerania. As we said in paragraph 11 above, we consider this unlikely. Except for this we have no comment on paragraphs 17-27 of theReport, and we endorse the view of1 our Delegation that the Poles are probablytoo optimistic regarding their ability to resist the German advance.Main, German Offensive ivj the West.   (Paragraphs 52-54.)15. It is clear from the report that the Poles have not properly examined theproblem of what they could do in these circumstances. It is interesting to notealso that they estimate that the Germans would allot 40 divisions for a defensivein the East, but that for a defensive in the West only 25 to 28 would be needed(paragraphs 15 and 53). This is another instance of under-estimation of theGerman and over-estimation of their own forces.Air Operations. . *16. These are dealt with mainly in Annex VII, where various courses ofaction for the Polish, German, French and British air forces are discussed. Inparagraph 27, however, the view is expressed that even intensive air action onour part is unlikely &quot;to do more than attract a few machines from the East.&quot;We consider that the degree of diversion which will be forced upon the german air forces will depend to a large extent upon the objectives we decide to attack,but we agree that at least in the early stages we cannot rely on being able to relieve the pressure on Poland to any material extent. This is a matter which hasbeen dealt with fully in another paper (Paper No. C.O.S. 939 (also C.I.D. PaperNo. D.P. (P.) 65)).17. It should be noted that the Poles intend to employ their bombers inclose support of their land forces irrespective of whether the main german offensive is directed against them or against the Western front (paragraph 54).We should, however, impress upon the Poles our view as to the importance of attack on more distant objectives, particularly on the large oil fuel reserves atStettin or the naval base at Konigsberg, which would have considerable value asa diversion. The former, in particular, is a most important objective. Polishaction against Stettin would supplement our own air action against other oilobjectives further west, and the success of the plan for attack on oil as a^whoiewould have an immediate and substantial effect on Germany&apos;s capacity tocontinue a war. The Poles should therefore be urged to attack Stettin as soonas conditions permit.We should, hoiuever, impress upon zhe Poles the necessity for reaching an agreed policy on the question of the air objectives to be attached,, on the lines ofthat which has been agreed with the French.18. The Poles at present rely almost entirely upon A.A. guns and fightersfor protection against German air attack, and have apparently not takensufficient steps towards adopting camouflage or providing shelters. The weightand intensity of air attack to which Germany, could subject them is rather morethan 10 times as great as the heaviest experienced in Spain, and we should warnthem that in our opinion adequate passive defence measures form an essential part of any modern system of air defence.Allied Assistance.19. This is a matter to which we have given full consideration in anotherpaper (Paper No. C.O.S. 939, also C.I.D. Paper No. D.P. (P.) 65). The Poles will presumably be informed in due course of our decisions.  With reference to certain[19657] b 2
points specifically raised in this paper-paragraphs 49 (&amp;) and (d) the Air staff are examining the possibility of operating a limited number of Bombers fromPolish aerodromes-which it may be possible to make use of as advanced operationalbases provided that certain essential maintenance requirements and stocks of bombs can be established there in peace. Should the examination prove that theseprojDosals are practicable, we recommend that discussions should be initiated withthe Polish Staff on this subject, and that the Air Ministry should be authorisedto despatch to Poland together with the material which we are supplying tothe Poles for their own use such stocks of bombs and maintenance stores as couldbe spared from this country.At the same time it should be pointed out that the object of operating fromPolish aerodromes would be to allow our own aircraft to reach the more distantobjectives in Eastern Germany and to cause the dispersion of German air defences.Reserves and War Potential. -20. The Report draws attention (paragraphs 35-51, and Annex VII, para-graphs 13-17) to the difficulties with which the Poles will be faced in maintaining their war effort. They are apparently now less unwilling to accept Russianassistance in the supply of war material, but there are no doubt still many difficulties to be overcome. We should, however, impress upon the Poles that theonly hope of getting appreciable supplies of material is to get them from Russia,as is pointed out in paragraph 45 of the Report.21. With regard to British assistance in the supply of war material weunderstand that the Allied Demands Sub-Committee has made a full investigation into the Polish requirements and action is in hand to satisfy them in so far as it ispossible.Further Staff Contacts.22. The Poles were anxious that further discussions between British and polish Staff Officers should take place. We endorse this suggestion and, in viewof the Polish desire that they should be conducted on a high level, suggest that theChiefs of Staff might themselves receive a Polish delegation in London. In thisconnection we draw attention to paragraphs 49 and 50 of the Report, which showthat the Poles hope that the Allies will be able to take some form of action early on which will have a real effect in reducing German pressure in the East. Theproblem has been dealt with in other Papers (C.I.D. Papers Nos. DP. (P.) 59and 65).It is most important that it should be resolved as far as it can be in advanceof&apos; the event, and at an early date.It seems essential also to include French representation in any further conversations with the Poles.(Signed) R.

Introduction.CONVERSATIONS with the Polish General Staff took place on the 23rdand 24th. 25th and 30th May, and were recorded in French by a Polish GeneralStaff Officer, and submitted to both parties for approval.The approved versions were signed on the 1st June.The Polish Officers taking part were : Brig.-Gen. Stachiewicz : Chief of General Staff.Admiral Swirski : Chief of Polish Navy.Brig.-Gen. Ujeiski: Chief of Air Staff in General Staff.Colonel Jaklicz : 2nd Deputy Chief of General Staff.and on one occasion : Lt.-Col. Orski : 4th Bureau General Staff.Major Dziewanowski : General Staff, acted as Secretary.2. The Polish Officers maintained a most cordial spirit, and laid ba,re,with the utmost frankness, their most secret information with one exception. TheBritish Delegation was unable to respond so freely, owing to the fact tha.t theywere not fully conversant with the details of the present military plans of theUnited Kingdom. It may have been that this caused the Poles to withhold detailsregarding their initial concentration arrangements, but it in no way affected thecourse of the conversations.II.- Alignment.3. As will be seen later, the Poles have been solely preoccupied with theidea of a main German attack directed on themselves alone, and therefore their interest was mainly in the attitude of their neighbouring States. The possible action of distant ones has received little, if any, attention, and, moreover, thesituation with regard to two of them, Turkey and Russia, has changed very recently. In general, their views are, except as regards Hungary, the sameas ours.
JLJ-wivijKj/J y * -      . ,4. The Poles state that Hungary will neither join the Germans noracquiesce in the use by German Armies of their territory. They say theHungarians have definitely made this known to Germany, and. theyfaffirm thatthere is a strong resistance in Hungary to all attempts by Germany to obtain adominating influence. We do not share the Polish view, which we think is largelybased on historic ties and sentiment towards a people whose social structure isvery similar to their own. They further believe that Hungary would be afraid toattack Rqumania. They have a low opinion of the military value of the hungarian Army, which they say is badly equipped, without reserves of warmaterial, indifferently trained, and still imbued with the military ideas of 1918.Russia.5. The Poles still regard the Russians with suspicion and aversion. Theydo not wish to enter into direct relations in peace time with a view to cooperationin war, pleading that this would be a provocation to Germany. This we regard as an excuse; the real reason is they fear that it..will lead to the employment ofRussian troops in Poland, and they are afraid that, once there, it may beimpossible to get rid of them, and, further, that they may bolshevise the popula-tion, especially in the-Eastern districts.They even look with disfavour on the suggestion, that, if Lithuania were theobject of German aggression, Eussia might send troops to her assistance throughthe northern corner of Poland.They agree, somewhat reluctantly, that they might accept air assistance fromRussia, and allow them to establish the necessary ground Organisation in Poland.They were non-committal on the subject of using Russian naval bases.Poland draws supplies of raw material from Russia in peace, and looks to a continuance of this in war, which is essential to enable their factories to maintainproduction.They would also willingly accept Russian finished war material in war time,but are reluctant to start the necessary negotiations to that end in peace time, andit would need very careful diplomatic handling to bring the two parties together to discuss the arrangements to put this into force.This is discussed later, Section IX.Roumania.6. The Polish interpretation of the Polish-Roumanian alliance is that it provides for military co-operation only in the event of an attack on either by russia, and is not designed to have effect if Germany is the aggressor.The Poles do not expect Germany to make any attack on Roumania untilshe has already put Poland out of court as German communications in a warwith Roumania are too exposed to Polish attack.They have therefore no plans for mutual co-operation against german aggression and no conception of a common stable eastern defensive front,necessitating the employment of a certain number of German divisions to watch it.The Poles were very uncommunicative about the Roumanian Army, and its military value, no doubt from a feeling of loyalty to a country that has been theirally for most of the post-war period.Latvia and, Estonia,7, They will get no military assistance from these. States. They even doubt the possibility of getting war supplies through these countries, as they might put a very strict interpretation on the meaning of neutrality. In addition,Germany would probably have complete control of the Baltic.Lithuania.8.   The Poles have no expectation of help, as they have no treaty with her.But they are seriously concerned with the possibility of German aggression intoLithuania, which they would regard as a definite threat to their independence and they are anxious to know the attitude of Great Britain if thev went to theassistance of Lithuania. J
After consultation with the Ambassador I gave, somewhat diffidently, the answer that if Poland informed us that she felt her independence threatened,and was thus obliged, in self-defence, to take action, we were bound to come toher assistance in every possible way, including military action but we feel thatthe question should be more clearly and definitely answered by the diplomats.The Poles do not expect the Soviets to take any steps to help Lithuaniaagainst German aggression, and point out that to do so the Russians would need to cross Polish Territory, but, on the other hand, they consider the Soviets will come to the aid of Latvia and Estonia to resist German attack.III. Polish Strategic Conception.9. The Poles are convinced that the Germans will, at the beginning of thewar, direct their whole available weight against Poland, maintaining a defensiveattitude on all other fronts until Poland has been put out of court. All their plans are based on this conception, and they have really very little idea of what action they would take in any other situation, beyond a general statement that itwould facilitate the counter-offensive which they always intend to make.10. They are thus dealing with their own problem in its most menacingaspect, and the one which presents the greatest difficulties. They are under nodelusions that this will cause them tremendous losses, involve the abandonment ofa large part of their country, the cessation of all trade, except across the russian and Roumanian frontier, the loss of their Silesian industrial resources and perhaps of others further inland, but they face this catastrophe with a certainrather admirable confidence that they will always be able to maintain a frontagainst their enemy somewhere in Poland, and that the eventual defeat ofGermany is certain as she will not be able to stand the pressure of a long war against France and England.IV.-German Forces.11. The Poles reckon the total mobilised strength of the German Army to bre from 110 to 120 divisions, of which they believe the main weight will be directedon Poland alone, leaving holding forces on all other frontiers, until the defeat ofPoland liberates more troops for an offensive in the West.12. They think that the action of the land armies will be supported byunremitting air attack, the objectives of this air attack being, firstly, the enemy air forces and ground establishments; secondly, vital points on the Lines ofCommunication; and, thirdly, industrial establishments, especially those supplying the needs of the Army. This is the order of priority of air attack, as given in a recent secret German publication Luftkriegsfuhrung, of which they have obtained a copy. The Poles do not consider that any question of danger to civilians will cause the Germans to shrink from bombing any of these ob^ctives in order toobtain the required result.13. The order of battle of the German Army, according to Polish GeneralStaff calculations, is given in Annex I and of their Air Force in Annex II.14.   The Polish Naval Staff consider that the German Navy will attack theirsea coast and the help peninsula.V. Course of the War.   Opening Phases.15.   On this assumption, the Poles conclude that the initial dispositions ofthe German Army will be as follows : Eastern Striking Force Corps from East Prussia.Stettin.Berlin.Dresden.Munster (part).Hamburg.Hanover.nurnberg.Total, 81 active and reserve divisions.16 Landwehr divisions.
Corps from Stuttgart.&quot;    WiesBaden.      &quot; ^Kassel. . *   &quot; &apos;17-20 divisions.(&amp;) Dutch, frontier and north-west sea coast-Corps from Munster (part).8 divisions.(c) Bohemia and Jugoslav frontier Corps from Vienna.Munich.Salzburg.9 divisions.N.B.- This last group seems rather inconsistent as regards the number of divisions compared with Corps. On another occasion reference was made to theemployment of the Vienna Corps on the right flank of the advance on Poland,which it is thought is more probable.16.   The Eastern Striking Force is expected to be concentrated as follows : Pomerania 20 divisions 4-5 Landwehr divisions.Objective. The Corridor-to run Bydgoszez Area and join handswith East Prussia movement-Warsaw.Silesia-26 divisions-f 6 Landwehr divisions.Obj ective.-Lodz-Warsaw-Industrial Centre.Moravia 10 divisions -\- 2 Landwehr divisions.Objective.-Polish Silesia-Krakow.East Prussia 5 divisions f 3 Landwehr divisions.17.1 The employment of the East Prussian troops is visualised as beingundoubtedly offensive, in one of two alternatives : 1.. Due South on Warsaw.This course represents a threat at the very heart of Poland, but hasthe disadvantage that it is disconnected from the main advance fromPomerania, and gives the Poles the opportunity of defeating them beforesupport arrives. For this reason the Poles do not expect it unless and untilthe Germans have considerably reinforced the East Prussian Corps&quot;with others (the Hamburg Corps is considered a likely reinforcement).The Poles therefore consider it of the utmost importance to obtainany information or indications of movement by sea, and if such movementshould not take place until war began, that action should be taken againstthe German transports, and suggest that England might be able to assist,which would have important results at the very outset. A calculation oftransport necessary to move German troops to East Prussia is given in annex III, paragraph 7.2. South-West on to run.This course is more prudent for the existing East Prussian Corps, as itwould be supported by the main advance from Pomerania. It is therefore the most likely, with the present forces.A third line of attack, eastwards towards Grodno and the Wilno railway,has been considered, but as nothing more than a raid.18. In addition to the Naval attack mentioned in paragraph 14 above, thePolish Naval Staff consider that German Naval action in the Baltic will be mainly confined to safeguarding the sea communications to East Prussia and the iron oretrade from Sweden.
19. The Poles fully recognise tne strength of this menace--a preponderance of 2 to 1 in land forces &quot;alone. They realise that it will be impossible to hold the corridor and the Poznan salient, and have, no intention of employing their strength in trying to do so except at Hei (see. Annex III).help is intended to serve, after the Germans have taken Gdynia and the seacoast, as a naval base from which to attack German sea communications withEast Prussia. This they consider as of prime importance, see paragraph 24,but while it is possible they might retain hold of the help peninsula after theloss of Gdynia, the harbour would come under-shell-fire and air bombardment,and its utility is problematical. Polish naval efforts could not therefore be of long duration.20. They intend to conserve their forces by retiring to a position which willbe both shorter and will give natural facilities for defence. They hope to beable to keep intact a central reserve for use in a counter-offensive, especially ifthe Germans start drawing troops from the East to reinforce the west.This position includes the five following parts(a) The East Prussian frontier.(b) A salient to cover Bydgoszez and to run.(c) A line running roughly.north and south from the neighbourhood ofInowraciaw through Kolo to Czestochowa. This is a region where anetwork of lakes and rivers gives the Poles an excellent framework for various defensive positions.(d) The small fortified line which the Poles already have in the Katowicearea, and which they are now extending&quot; both northwards andsouthwards.(e) Carpathians.21. The General Staff are starting preliminary work on these lines opposite East Prussia they have begun to construct defensive works, they are working at the organisation of defence of the Carpathians and in the centrallake and river region they are studying various alternative lines of defence and anti-tank measures, establishing a number of dumps of material (concrete, barbed wire, &amp;c.) and organising the civil population to undertake the work whenordered.22. They intend to carry out extensive demolitions before giving up thewestern districts, and they have organised a secret service to operate behind theGerman armies a method of warfare in which they have much experience andhave employed with success against Russia.VI. Later Phases.23. The Polish conception of the course of the war ieads to eventuallaunching of a counter-offensive.While they are bringing the German armies to a standstill, they expect to beable to take local offensives with their cavalry and motorised brigade againstcolumns of German motorised troops who find themselves unable to advance bydemolitions on the main roads and by the inability of country roads to carry the motor vehicles in large numbers (see Annex IV).24. They have also the conception of a strategic counter-stroke into east prussia, which they categorically state will be the first object of their attack, asit is always a threat directed at the very heart of their country. The importance which they attach to East Prussia seems to be equally shared by the Germans, asthe Poles state that, besides the field defences more or less along the frontier,through the lake and forest area, which is provided with concrete emplacements,barbed wire and anti-tank&apos; obstacles, the Germans are making Konigsbefg intoa sort of magnified bridgehead, protected by strong fortifications extending fromthe neighbourhood of Labian to that of Braunsberg.25. There is undoubtedly too much optimism in this conception. The Poleshave a much lower opinion of the German army than we have. They bring forward,, in support of their opinion (a) The shortage of 3ST.C-.Os., Officers and Staff Officers, which will limit theexpansion of the German Army.119657] c
VII.-Polish Forces.28. To oppose this powerful German invading force, the Poles are able to mobilise an army composed, of : 30 active divisions,10 reserve divisions,11 cavalry brigades,1 armoured brigade,which is practically all on a horsed basis and is short of heavy artillery and armoured fighting vehicles. The aviation consists mainly of medium-range bombers, the fighters represent only 30 per cent, of the total and are of poor quality. The Air Force will be used almost entirely for army co-operation,bombing raids into Germany will only be undertaken in the form of reprisalswhen conditions are favourable and unlikely to lead to undue losses.29.   The details of the Polish Army are given in Annexes V and VI.The whole of this Army will be used in the operations against Germany theremaining frontiers of Poland (Lithuanian and Russian) will continue&apos; to beguarded by the Frontier Guard Corps alone.(&amp;) Low standard of training, due to the fact that for many years since 1918no yearly classes were conscripted.[c) Lack of heavy artillery.(d)Over motorisation.In Poland metalled roads, comparatively plentiful in Poznan, getfewer and fewer as one moves East: and lateral roads less frequent.They are not very strongly built- and would suffer much from con-tinuous heavy traffic. They are unfenced, with a ditch separatingthem from the fields. There are frequent country tracks, betweenvillages and farms, but innocent of all metal and in wet weatherbecome deep in mud. Any bridges on them are generally wooden and only suitable for local traffic, i.e., horsed carts. These are quiteunusable by heavy motor vehicles, except in very dry weather, and even then a low-lying patch may bog a lorry.A column of motorised troops, moving on one of the metalledroads, and encountering an obstacle, e.g., destroyed, bridge, is boundto halt. The nearest metalled lateral road may be miles behind, to reverse the column to gain this road is no easy task, and if it doesso, the column would only gain access to another road, full of troops.In fact, the whole advance is delayed until the obstacle can bemade good, and the troops reduced to a defensive attitude.(e) Poor quality of German mechanised vehicles, as shown in Austria.(/) The length that motorised formations will take on the few roads, whichwill necessitate several divisions using the same road one brokenbridge will halt a column of dozens of miles in length, which will be unable to get off the road, or to reverse and take another road, andwill be open to cavalry attack:(g) Consequent difficulties in petrol supply.26. The Poles forget that their Army also suffers from some of these defects,from more natural causes, and that weaknesses in motorisation in some directionsare balanced by strength in others.If the German effort is directed against them, in the proportions given above,and with intensive air action, it is to be feared that the Poles will be driven intothe Eastern and wilder parts of their country, and that organised resistance maycollapse, unless another miracle on the Vistula saves them.27. The Poles are very anxious to learn what action in the West the alliescan take to reduce the pressure in the East, but it is not likely that intensive air action on our part will clo more than attract a few machines from the East, whilethe effects of a land attack on the Siegfried Line are outside the knowledge of the delegation. The Poles also seem disappointed to learn that naval action in theBaltic is not envisaged by the British Navy on anything but a very small scale,and then only if a base is available.
30. The actual zones of concentration were not communicated to the delegation, the excuse being that to explain the movements and other details wasa matter of some complexity and would, take too long in these preliminary con-versations, and had better be kept till a more detailed study of * the Allied WarMeasures was made, but I feel that the real reason for this, the only occasion ofany reticence, was that I was unable to give corresponding information myself(see paragraph 2).But from various indications it seems that there will be-(a) An army group, sufficiently strong to oppose an advance from east prussia i.e., somewhere in the area north of Modlin.(&amp;) An Army group in the Bydgoszcz to run area.(c) An Army group in S.W. Poland and Polish Silesia.(cl) A group watching the passes of the Carpathians.It may be conjectured that there will also be an Army group between (&amp;) and(c) above, i.e., in the Kolo area, and one or two in central reserve.31. It is generally believed, that the efficiency of the Polish Army hasincreased greatly in the last few years the training of the officers especially, andthe n.c.o.&apos;s is of a much better standard staff work and higher command has improved, and administration is efficient. It is remarkable that it is generallyconsidered that corruption is now rare. There seems to be a great deal moremethod than there was work is well thought out.32. The Army and the country seem to be imbued with a spirit of courageand determination--and quite prepared to accept the consequences which may come from a refusal to give way to Hitler&apos;s wishes. Many of them think a war is inevitable and it is better to have it now and get it over, a,s they state their belief that the situation in Germany is favourable to Poland now, and may not be later.The grounds for this belief are not apparent, nor could the Poles explain them,and it is probably only another case of light-hearted optimism.. All Poles believethat the German Army is not so efficient and strong as the speeches of Germanleaders would, like the world to believe.33. They expect the war to come in the harvest time, and have thereforetaken steps to have all crops burnt in the invaded regions.VIII. Weaknesses of the Polish Army.34:   The weakness of the Polish Army is the shortage of equipment.There are enough extra infantry battalions on mobilization to form the nucleus of five fresh divisions, but there is not the equipment for them or for theother arms to make up these divisions. There are some 600,000 trained reservistswho are surplus.They do not mobilise more than 40 divisions, because that is the number forwhich they have enough reserve war material to last for three months war. no fresh divisions will be formed, unless they can be provided with full mobilisationequipment and three months&apos; reserve put aside for them. They wish to increase this three months&apos; reserve to six months.35. Moreover, although great strides have been taken in the last 2-3 years to increase the home war industries, Poland&apos;s war factories are only able to cover a proportion of the expected wastage and expenditure in war, and that only ifproduction is not reduced either by enemy action or by shortage of raw materialsor skilled labour. All these factors are likely to come into play; with unhappyresults. A table showing how far, at present capacity, factories can make goodlosses, is given in Annex viii.36. The energy that has been put into the development of war industries inthe last 2-3 years is almost incredible. The delegation visited factories already working, where two years ago was uninhabited forest. The very latest type of machines had been installed, many bearing the date 1938, pipe-lines had been laid for some 200 kilometres to obtain natural gas as fuel from sources in theCarpathians and colonies built, with social services for the workmen. this development is still in progress, new factories are projected and existing ones tohe expanded. -In the case of certain newly put up factories, output &quot;will notcommence before the end of the year at the earliest.[19657] c 2
&apos; 37. These factories are scattered about in the Central Industrial Area, southof Warsaw, so as to be well back front the frontier, where so many existingfactories, mines, blast, furnaces, &amp;c, are situated.- But they suffer from certaindisabilities which cannot be. removed by lavish expenditure of money.(a) Shortage of skilled labour-In. spite of all accounts of the intelligenceof the peasant turned into workman, of the schools where each man istrained, but only trained to one process and so forth, we remain of the belief tiiat the shortage exists and must continue. As regardsengineers, it seems that enough young men are being turned out by the, engineering- universities. -, A.;(b) Shortage of tools (cutters, drills, &amp;c.).-Though at the start of work in-&apos;;        a new factory a good reserve supply is laid down, it seems doubtful ifwastage can &quot;be made- good in war, even though factories are designedto produce their own tools. ;  :   /, (c) Shortage of raw materials-Certain raw materials are available, in poland, but from the Upper Siiesian frontier district chiefly, and this: -:; supply would be cut on in war.   Factories are being required to lay insix months&apos; reserve stocks, but this is not complete yet.\dj Difficulty of import of raw malerials.-Poid.iiA gets in peace, and wouldalso in war, certain raw materials from Russia, but to keep her war industry going, especially with the expansion that- is in progress, itwould be absolutely necessary to augment the import of raw and partlymanufactured materials from other sources, and to find the means of getting them to Poland.   This is discussed later (Section IX).(e) Vulnerability to A ir A attack. In spite of dispersion, these new factoriesremain vulnerable to the air. A series of new buildings, in a forest,with new roads and railways between them, rather attracts thanavoids observation from the air and, although these establishmentsare being provided with A.A. guns (to be manned by the workers),they are still vulnerable. The Poles are optimistic in this also theyquote that in Spain factories were never really stopped by air raids.They have done no camouflage, nor constructed any shelters forpersonnel. They have an unjustifiable faith in the hitting power ofthe A.A. gun.(f) Ready cash. The cost of the new industries, of- partial&apos;mobilisation andother expenses due to the abnormal situation, have drained the country of cash. They cannot find the money for current needs-wages, forinstance, and above all for the purchase of raw materials and half-manufactured products which they need to keep their industries atwork.   Lack of ready money will reduce the already inadequateoutput.IX. Maintenance of War Supplies.38. The Polish Army, as now organised, can keep the field from its reservestocks for 2-3 months. Its existing factories can keep it going for another period,but the factors are so liable to change that it is difficult to give an estimate ofthis period.  No one can say-(a) How many factories will fall into the hands of the German armies.(b) How far output of others will be reduced by air action.(c) Whether they can be fed with raw and half-manufactured materials.(d) Will the necessary skilled labour be available.But, for argument&apos;s sake, let us suppose they will be able to keep the army goingfor a further 2-3 months. In other words, unless Allied assistance is given to poland, she will be out of the war in 6 months at the most.39. The following sections refer in particular to Army supplies, thequestion of Air supplies being dealt with in Annex VII, devoted to the wholequestion of Air assistance.40. In order that Poland may put her whole weight into the war, it seems that the problem is in tAvo parts : (1) The provision of war material now to enable her to use her surplustrained men as soon as war begins and to increase her fighting power.
(2) The organisation of a system of maintenance and replacement of warlosses.  This, in its turn, means-(a) provision and maintenance of finished war material,(&amp;) provision  of  raw  and  half-manufactured  material   for  herindustries,and in all cases, cash.41. If the Western Powers look upon Poland as an Ally, and count upon her to make her utmost contribution to the combined war effort, it seems axiomaticthat any help that can now be given is not merely for the benefit of Poland, but is of equal benefit to the Western Powers.   Such aid is cash.Immediate cash should show a return in an increase in the number of divisions in&apos; the Polish Army, and in giving them a longer run for their moneyby enabling them to work their factories to the full, and thus produce many ofthe requirements of new divisions and for reserve stocks.42. But cash will not provide all these requirements, but only such as canbe manufactured in Poland. To increase the fighting power, Poland requiresfinished war material over and above what she can produce herself namely,aeroplanes, fighters especially A.F.Vs. -and heavy artillery. To wait until warbegins before sending this material aid would rob the provision of much of its value. The normal routes of importation would be closed, cargo space hard toobtain and long journeys necessary before the goods arrived, and time would be lost in teaching the recipients how to use them. In fact, the Polish Army mightbe so badly hammered before then as to be unable to make proper use of them.To sum up the first part of the problem as stated above : to increase the powerof resistance of the Polish Army at the outbreak of war needs the provision of cash and war material now, and the organisation of a maintenance service.43. The second part of the problem is not so simple. To build up suchvast stores of arms, half manufactured and raw materials in peace, so as toenable the Army to live on its reserves for the duration, would be impossible for financial reasons. It is, therefore, a question of assuring a constant flow ofmaterial, and this means the selection of the means of transport and the sources of supply.44. As Germany will control the Baltic, and regular passage of shipsthrough the Western Mediterranean may be impracticable until the Italian fleetis neutralised, there remain only the following routes : -(a) By Murmansk (and Archangel in summer) through Russia. the murmansk railway has very poor capacity; there is a canal as analternative.(&amp;) By Transiberian railway.  A very long journey, also of limited capacity.\c) Through the Eastern Mediterranean to a Black Sea port.45. But the use of these long and risky movements could be greatlyminimised by using Russia as a source of supply, for such requirements as she can produce, and these are (a) Raw materials and semi-manufactures.In order to ensure a regular supply in war time, it is desirable that steps betaken in peace to study the question in detail, both as regards the quantities ofthe different items than can be delivered and the machinery for delivering them,and very probably the financial consequences (see Annex IX).(b) Russian war material.The Poles have signified their willingness to accept this, but it introducesthe complication of two types of equipment in use concurrently and the necessityfor teaching the troops to use the new type, which must be done beforehand.Steps must here also be taken in peace to ensure the regular supply in war.(c) Manufacture by Russia of Polish war material.This is probably the most satisfactory answer to the problem. If suchmanufacture was agreed upon, it would necessitate the supply to Russianfactories of jigs and tools of Polish pattern beforehand, in peace time.  The
placing, then, of orders in peace would encourage the manufacture, ensure thecontinuance, and provide the Poles with the additional material which they sobadly want, both to increase their present low reserves and to enable the creationof more divisions.  But it also requires previous study.. 46. In fact, the use of - Russia in any way as a source of supply demandspreliminary consultation, agreement, and the drawing up of definite plans, and,in view of the reluctance of the Boles to enter into military conversations withRussia, it calls for-very tactful diplomatic handling to bring the two parties together and to help them to come to terms.47. When the Italian fleet is neutralised, and no longer able to interferewith traffic in the Mediterranean, the passage of all sorts of supplies to Polandwill be easier and sources far wider, and it will not be so difficult to ensure thesupply of raw material which is lacking, and possibly of machinery and semi-manufactures. It would also be possible to supply finished war material, but, ifthis is not of Polish type, the complication of two types comes in again. Whereasif Polish type is to be supplied, it again needs the provision of Polish jigs andtools well beforehand thus duplicating the Russian supply- -and -it. would seembetter to organise the latter, which is always transportable to Poland, rather thana- foreign source, which will be less accessible at the moment of Poland&apos;s greatest need.48. As regards Naval supplies, it is improbable that the Polish Navy willbe able to base in Polish waters for long after the outbreak of war. Its suppliestherefore depend on whether certain units will be able to escape through Danishwaters to England, or would be able to base themselves on Russia, In the formercase, the supplies for units built in England, Prance or Holland presents lessdifficulty.X. Allied Military Assistance.49. Besides material help, the Poles have, again rather optimistically, hoped for some visible military aid, namely ? (a) Naval action in the Baltic. They have been informed that unless a baseis available, British action could only be confined to submarine raids.These, in view of the nebulous targets offered, and the risks entailed,are not envisaged at the outset. The present state of fortificationsat help does not warrant the establishment of stocks of fuel, &amp;o, thereprior to the outbreak of war. and it is unlikely that it will be available as a base at a later period.(b) Air Assistance.--Thej would like some air forces to be based on Poland,but suggest as an alternative using Poland as a refuelling base betweenflights from England to Poland and back again. The difficulties of organising, in peace, the ground staff necessary for either of these plans was pointed out, but they may return to the subject later.(c) A attack by land forces on the Western front. The Delegation not beingcognisant of the Anglo-French plan could give no encouragement.(d) Intensive air action. We stated that our whole Air Eoree would be occupied on protecting the Home Country, which included air offen-sives with Germany; but the Poles hoped our targets would be furthereast, so as to touch the Germans operating against Poland.50. The Poles fully understand that our Naval action will eventually bring pressure upon the wdiole German war effort, and that our air action will demandcounter-action by the mass of German aviation, but they hanker for some formof action that will have a. direct influence on the course of operations in theEast, at the moment it is most dangerous to Poland, i.e., the first few weeks,even days, of the war.51. Should the outcome of the conversations with Russia be satisfactory,it would be desirable to encourage the Polish and Russian naval staffs to discussconcerted plans for action in &apos;he Baltic.
XI. Main German Offensive in the West.52. The Poles have hardly considered what action they would take if theGermans staged their main attack in the west (whether or not through the low countries), and held the Polish front defensively. They have no schemesprepared for this, and merely suggest that it will be easier for them to pass to the offensive in the most suitable direction. When asked in which direction, theycould only reply that it depended on the situation at the time in other words,they have got no offensive plan, and they treat the situation just the same as that where the main German blow is on the East, when they decide on the local counter-offensive according to the situation. But East Prussia is always in their mind asan objective of first importance.53. They think the Germans might leave about 30 divisions (including10 Landwehr) on the Polish front, the Army Corps from East Prussia, Stettin,Berlin and Dresden. A further 10 divisions (Corps of Vienna and Salzburg)would be kept in Bohemia and opposite the Yugoslav frontier, which would leavesome 70-80 divisions for the West.54. The Poles again say they would not be able, to use their Air Force forlong-distance bombing raids in Germany, unless the attendant circumstances were very propitious, but would use it for Army Co-operation. Such a course would compel the Germans to leave, they estimate, some 20 per cent. (200 machinesaccording to their figures) of fighters against Poland, but very few bombers. Thisview is somewhat optimistic, since, in view of Polish air inferiority, it isprobable that the Germans could contain it with a smaller number of fighters.XII. Mutual Co-operation between Polish and British General Staffs.Peace.55. It was agreed that it was desirable that there should be a closer personalcontact between the senior officers of the two staffs concerned and that theyshould get to know each other by an exchange of visits apart from any missionthat might be sent from one to another for purposes of getting war material, &amp;c.It was desirable that there should be a freer exchange of information and of views between the two Intelligence Staffs.. Comments and criticism would be welcomed as well as exchange of items of information.War.56. It was agreed that the presence of a military mission at the head-quarters of the other ally was the only practicable way of assuring free exchangeof information and co-ordination of action.There was some suggestion that a common cypher should be employedbetween the two parties but in the end it was recognised to be superfluous, andthat each party should communicate with its Mission in its own cypher.Again, some idea of having special means of communication between the twoGeneral Headquarters and their Missions was broached, but it was eventuallyagreed that the means of ensuring communication had better be left to be settled by the experts in this matter.XIII. General Conclusions.1. The Poles expect the main German attack to be directed against them.2. The Poles can put 40 divisions into the field, against some 80 german divisions.3. Their air force is far inferior, and will only be used for Army Co-opera-tion.   They lack fighters.4. They do not intend to hold their western frontier, but to withdraw to a shorter line of rivers and lakes, somewhat east of the old German-Russian frontier.5. They optimistically hope for chances of local counter offensives, and keepEast Prussia in mind as a possible objective.6. They have over half a million trained reservists surplus to mobilisationstrength, but cannot organise them for lack of equipment.
7. They are building up reserves of war material, and at present have enoughto replace 2-3 months&apos; wastage. -S. The output of their factories is only sufficient to cover about 50 per cent,of their losses. ....9. As newly built factories come to production, and others projected arebuilt, output will increase, provided they are not interfered with by enemy action, and they are able to ensure supplies of raw material and skilled labour. All these factors tending to reduce output are likelyto take effect.10. To keep the Polish Army in the field outside help is necessary.11. This may take the form of :  (a) Provision of war material now, especially fighting planes and guns.(b) Organisation of supply of war material from outside, and of rawmaterial.(c) Credits or loans.12. Owing to transport difficulties elsewhere, Russia is the most suitablesource of supply.13. To ensure this supply, negotiations should be started without delay. if russia is to provide war material of Polish pattern, the necessary jigsand tools should be given to Russia at once.14. Poland does not welcome the idea of Russian troops coming to her aidon Polish soil, but would accept the help of Russian air forces workingfrom bases in Poland.   She would accept Russian war material.15. The Poles welcome the idea of closer,collaboration between their GeneralStaff and ours, both in peace and war.16. Polish naval strength cannot affect the course of operations in eastern europe, but at the outset it may force the Germans to retain naval units in the Baltic disproportionate to its strength.17. No part of the Polish coast is suitable for a base for British naval units.(Signed) E. CLAYTON, Brig., G.S.II. B. RAWLINGS, Captain, R.N.A. P. DAVIDSON, Group Captain,- R.A.F:Richmond Terrace.
