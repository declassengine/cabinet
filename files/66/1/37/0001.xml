aegis DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may he taken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NO.WAR      CABINET.LAND FORCES COMMITTEE.SECOND   REPORT.In our First Report55 we recommended to the WarCabinet that for production planning by the Minister ofSupply, the supply on the full British Army scale of55 Divisions should be the objective by the end of thesecond year of the war.2. At their Meeting on the 9th September, 1939, theWar Cabinet agreed inter alia35 5E 5S 5  X&quot;(iii)      To defer a decision on the size of the Land Forces which shouldbe our ultimate objective in thepresent war, until the land forces Committee had consideredthe production requirements of thethree Services as a whole.&quot;3E X 36 3E a3. We have based our examination of this problem onthe production requirements of the Air Ministry for an output of 2,550 aircraft per month (of which H50 are planned for construction in the Dominions) and of the Ministry ofSupply for an army of 55 Divisions.     We have also taken intoaccount the production requirements of the Admiralty and of the mercantile Marine.4. Our recommendations and conclusions may be summarisedas followsPaper No. W.P.  (39) 14:       (also Paper No. L.F.  (39) 5.)-1-

That our aim should he the maximumconcerted effort of which the countryis capable, which should, of course,be in no way less than that made in 1918;and that a public statement to this effect should be made as soon as possibleThat the provision of the productionrequirements for 55 Divisions on thefull British scale   within a period oftwo years can be regarded as anaim which can be achieved withoutinterfering with the requirements ofthe Wavy, the Royal Air Force (on thebasis given in paragraph 3 above) andof the Mercantile Marine;That the &quot;programmes of the Army and theRoyal Air Force, on the basis set outin this paper, and of the Navy and mercantile Marine on the existing bases,should be regarded as a first stage,to be increased if found practicableon further detailed examination.That the programmes under the first stageshould be submitted to the necessary financial examination, and to a statistical investigation under the aegis of the Ministry of Labour, with a viewto determining more exactly the labourdemands in various categories which will arise, and to defining the resultantproblems, e.g. of dilution and so forthwhich will have to be surmounted.Thereafter, the examination should beextended to investigating the possibilityof meeting labour demands for stillfurther expansion of the -programmes.That the examinations suggested in (d)above should not be permitted to delay the immediate inception ofall necessary measures for production on the basis recommended as the first stage.That in acquiring sites for the factories required by his programme,the Minister of Supply should beauthorised, where appropriate, to take up sufficient land or areas to allow for subsequent expansion, shouldan aim of more than 55 Divisionsprove later to be practicable.
