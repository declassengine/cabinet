DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTTO BS KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document./WAR    CABINET.THE NEUTRALITY OR EIRE.Memorandum      the... Secretary of Sta-te frrrDomini on-&quot;affairs Irs.The attached memorandum, Appendix I, was handed tome by the High Commissioner for Eire on the 12th September.This memorandum purported to set out in detail therules which the Government of Eire intended to apply inrelation to belligerent ships and aircraft in order tomaintain their neutral status.In general, and if the matter should be consideredonly from the point of view of the rights and duties neutrals in international law, it would hardly be possibleto offer any serious criticism of the proposals set out inthe memorandum.     Many if not most neutral countries havealready found it desirable to set out in some detail therules which they intend to impose in such matters.    Although,therefore, it might be said that the rule prohibiting thestay of surface vessels in territorial waters, except incases of distress, goes further than is strictly necessary,it would not, I am advised, be practicable to argue that itwas an unreasonable exercise of authority.

It may be added that information conveyed to me.informally last week by the High Commissioner for Eire andby the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs atDublin, who has recently been to this country with a message from Mr. de Valera,  was to the effect that some emphaticstatement of Eire&apos;s neutrality was essential from the pointof view of political conditions in Eire, and that while theGovernment and the great majority of the people of Eirewere anxious to do what they could to help this country andwould in fact do so,  it was essential in Eire&apos;s interests that the small but active and irresponsible minority whoare implacably hostile to Great Britain should be given noloophole for creating difficultiesoI felts however,  on reading the memorandum that itwould be wrong, in any event, to acquiesce in the proposals contained in it - still less to accept them in any formalway - without making an effort to see whether they couldnot be modified so as to be less embarrassing from our point of view,      It had already been arranged for Sir JohnMaffey, who, it is contemplated,  should be selected for thepost of United Kingdom Representative in Eire if Mr. de valera is willing to agree to such an appointment, to payable preliminary visit to Dublin for the purpose of a generaltalk with Mr. de Valera.      I therefore asked him to use this opportunity to try to obtain a further    insight intoMr. de Valera&apos;s attitude on this particular question.Sir John Maffey has now returned to London,  andhis report is annexed as Appendix II to this memorandum.In the meantime the situation has been complicated by information received by the Admiralty from one of

It may be added that information conveyed to meinformally last week by the High Commissioner for Sire andby the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs atDublin, who has recently been to this country with a message from Mr. de Valera, was to. the effect that some emphaticstatement of Eire&apos;s neutrality was essential from the pointof view of political conditions in Eire, and that while theGovernment and the great majority of the people of Eirewere anxious to do what they could to help this country andwould in fact do so,  it was essential in Eire&apos;s interests that the small but active and irresponsible minority whoare implacably hostile to Great Britain should be given noloophole for creating difficultiesoI felt, however,  on reading the memorandum that itwould be wrong,  in any event, to acquiesce in the-proposals contained in it - still less to accept them in any formalway - without making an effort to see whether they couldnot be modified so as to be less embarrassing from our point of view.

I therefore asked him to use this opportunity to try to obtain a further    insight intoMr. de Valera&apos;s attitude on this particular question.Sir John Maffey has now returned to London,  andhis report is annexed as Appendix II to this memorandum.In the meantime the situation has been complicated by information received by the Admiralty from one of

9Q7&amp; U 6His Majesty&apos;s ships to the effect that members of therescued crew of a sunken German submarine have reportedthat they have recently landed in Eire, and purchasedcigarettes thereo      The men rescued from the submarineare, I understand, being sent to London for specialinterrogation, and until details are available we are notin a position to deal fully with the situation,,     Obviouslyif the information contained in the preliminary reportreferred to above is fully substantiated, particularly ifthe visit took place after the outbreak of war, it would afford a most valuable lever for further pressure on mr. de Valera.In the circumstances I think that I ought to bring to the attention of the War Cabinet at once the general considerations affecting Eire&apos;s attempt to maintainneutrality, and to set out the alternative courses opento us -(a) On the constitutional side the question of any formal recognition by this country of the neutrality of eire presents a serious difficulty.      We do not wantformally to recognise Eire as neutral while Eire remainsa member of the British Commonwealths      To do this wouldbe to surrender the hitherto accepted constitutionaltheory of the indivisibility of the Crown0     Equally wedo not want to take the line that Eire is no longer amember of the British Commonwealth.      This would involvethe rejection of the policy followed with the assent ofthe other Dominions since the establishment of the newConstitution of Eire in 1957 and would moreover have serious repercussions in many directions, e. g.  the statusunder United Kingdom law of individual Irishmen,

(b) Prom-th.e_jpractac.aX point of vie?; I understand thatthe. chief-desiderata of the Admiralty are(i) that there should he an adequate coast watchingservice on shore in Eire, the information collectedthereby being mads available without delay to theAdmiralty;(ii) that R.N.  surface vessels should be able to enterIEire territorial waters to discover and deal withsubmarines.    (The Admiralty do not contemplate thatiBritish submarines should enter Eire territorialI waters-)(iii) that R.N.  surface vessels and R,;A.P.  aircraft shouldbe able to make use of certain Eire ports as a base for operations against enemy submarines on the highseaSo      It is clear, however,  that a request to this effect to the Eire Government would be definitelyrefused by them in present circumstances.,I gather that the Admiralty view is that if (l) canbe secured effectively, the need for (ii) is not so pressingsbut   that if (i) cannot be secured, then (ii) becomes amatter of immediate urgeney0So far as the attitude of the Eire Government has been ascertained, it is clear that they wish themselves to conduct the coast watching service and to deal with any violation by german submarines of their territorial watersc      Indeed theyhave asked us to expedite the supply to them of anti-submarinematerial - viz.    submarine chasers, aeroplanes and depth charges - for this purpose0It is clear from the above that there are two problemsfacing us(i) how should we deal in general with Eire5 s desire for neutrality;(ii) assuming that we acquiesce in Eire&apos;s neutrality,how should we proceed in order to secure the^4-

9 9 nA; O Jmaximum assistance which the Sire Government can be  induced to afford to us?In general there would appear to he three courses of action possible;-(l) To refuse to acept the Eire memorandum   and tointimate that we reserve to ourselves the right to take such measures as are necessary, whether within Eire territorial waters or not, to suppress enemy submarine activitya      the objection to this course is that it might provoke an openbreach with Eire, which again might have unfortunate reactionson neutral and particularly United States - opinion?    that itwould presumably prevent any prospect of securing any assistance on.shore which the Eire authorities might otherwisehe willing to give, ebgo  through their coast watching service,and that such naval action might not In fact prove safe oradequate without shore facilities, which could   only beobtained by force, involving a still greater risk of seriousconflict with Eire.(2) To accept in substance and tacitly, the principle ofthe issue by Eire of rules governing admission to Eire ports and territorial waters of warships and aircraft, but to suggestthat it would be sufficient to frame them in more general terms,e.g.  so as to state that the Eire Government would, for thepurpose of preserving their neutrality, take all measuresappropriate in international law, and in particular, wouldprohibit the entry of submarines,,(3) To acquiesce in the proposals, as modified under (2),on certain conditions, the sub at -nee of which would be that wemust reserve to ourselves the right, in case of infringement&quot;by enemy vessels of the rules which the Eire Government have laid down to supplement any action which they may be able to takethemselves, by such measures as may be necessary to deal withsuch vessels and to prevent them from using Eire ports and territorial waters as a base for an attack upon us.-5-

We could make effective use, in this connection,  ofyfce de Valera &apos;s own public declaration in the Dail on 19thiMay,1937 that &quot;it would be our duty to do everything in our power tosee that no foreign country got a foothold on our soil........It is quite obvious that the people in Britain ...... would haveto give us the assistance which we, for our own sakes, would be anxious to call for, provided it was clear that the whole objectof it was to maintain the inviolability of our territory.&quot;Of these alternative courses I am in favour of (3) butif this course is followed it would be necessary to supplementit by making arrangements which would secure the maximum amountof practical contact and co-operation.     With this in view I am sure that we ought to continue to press strongly for theestablishment of a resident Representative in Dublin who wouldbe our co-ordinating agent for all such matters, and through whominformation obtained from the Eire coast watching service couldbe made available to the Admiralty.      It is clear that we must continue firmly to resist diplomatic nomenclature for suchapostoIf the War Cabinet approve, I should propose to ask sir john Mfaffey to return to Dublin in a few days&apos; time with suitablemessages from the Prime Minister and myself.      He would endeavour to reach agreement with Mr. de Valera on the lines indicated above and, in doing so, he v/ould, of course, make thefullest use of such information as may by then be available asa result of the examination of the captured crew of the german submarine.(intld.)

?Q1&amp; v -2-AIDE   IIEMOIKEhHanded to the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs by the High Commissioner for Eireon the 12th Septembers 19390The Government of Ireland, in order to ensureand maintain the neutral status of Ireland during thepresent state of war in Europe, have decided to placeimmediate restrictions on the use of Ireland&apos;s territorial waters, ports and roadsteads by vessels of y/ar, whethersurface or submarine crafty belonging to the belligerentPowers,,      They intend, moreover, to prohibit the entry into Irish jurisdiction of belligerent military aircraft,-.20     The Government of Ireland propose to apply;generally, to belligerent surface war vessels the ruleslaid down in Convention (No. XIII) concerning the rightsand duties of neutral Powers in naval war, which was signed at The Hague on the 18th October, 1907o      Accordingly,they have decided to prohibit within the territorial waters, ports and roadsteads of Ireland, all warlikeoperations on the part of any belligerent vessel armedfor war, including belligerent surface vessels which arenot naval war vessels, but which carry armaments otherthan armaments of a purely defensive character.     Theright to sojourn within the territorial waters, portsor roadsteads of Ireland will be prohibited until further notice to all such belligerent Vessels armed for war.Exception may be made only in certain well-recognised casesof distress or necessity for periods of time not exceeding,as a general rule,  a period of twenty-four hours.

3o      The Government of Ireland have.further decided in accordance with the practice of other neutral governments to prohibit to all belligerent submarines armed for warthe right to navigate or sojourn in Irish territorial waters, ports, or roadsteads-      Exception may be made onlyin eases where such submarines are forced to enterIrish waters due to severe damage amounting todisablemento      In such cases, belligerent submarinesmust navigate on the surface and display conspicuouslytheir national flag and other identification marksoSuch submarines, in the event of salvage, will be interned until the cessation of the hostilities. .4.      The Government of Ireland, relying onthe principle enunciated in Article 1 of the international convention for Air Navigation, 1919, whereby the airspace above the territory and territorial waters of aState shall be recognised as within its complete and exclusive sovereignty, propose to prohibit all military aircraft belonging to the belligerent Powers ironentering the jurisdiction of Ireland,,50      Pending the making of appropriate orders to give effect to the aforementioned proposals, theGovernment of Ireland desire to make then generally known to the United Kingdom Government.      The text ofthe Orders will be duly forwarded to you as soonas the Orders are made,(Signed) JOHN S&quot;. DULANTY.12th September, 1959.

APPENDIX II.REPORT BY SIP JOHN MAPPEY ON HIS VISIT to dublin ON THE Ihth * SEPTliiBER, 1939 aOn arrival at the Government Buildings in DublinI was received by Mr. Walshe, Secretary for external affairs, and after a few minutes talk with him I wastaken to Mr, de Valera/ s room and.was alone with thePresident from 10.15 till 12.k.5.Mr. de Valera began at once on the subject ofthe representation of the United Kingdom in Ireland.He had evidently made up his mind to state his views onthis straightaway before admitting any discussion.      Ihad not been present at the previous talks in Londonwhen Mr. Walshe must have been more forthcoming &apos;than   found the President,      Mr. de Valera did not stress the desirability of a better liaison but spoke withemphasis of the difficulties In the way of appointing a &quot;United Kingdom Representative&quot;, that is to say of creating an appointment of a new and special character.The shout would be raised of &quot;Dublin Castle back again&quot; andit would, be a battle cry for the I.R.A.  and Extremists.I said that I had been sent over in response to asuggestion from Dublin merely to ascertain what was inhis mind.     Had he not at one time favoured the idea ofa United. Kingdom Representative?     He replied that it was true that he had considered the. Idea but when he camecloser to It and, saw more of the forces working against him he had sensed a danger.      He spoke at some length ofthe difficulties of.his position, his every action studied by men bitterly opposed to any sort of rapprochementwith the United Kingdom, critical of any wavering fromthe strait path of neutrality.      &quot;All this happens because

you maintain the principle of partition in this island!&quot;He pointed to a map of Ireland hanging on the wall before him - Eire jet-black, Northern Ireland a leperous white.I said that most Englishmen looked forward to the day when this gulf would be bridged and thatthese feelings would be powerfully influenced both inEngland and Northern Ireland by the action and attitudeof Eire in these critical days.     The subject of partition recurred again and again and we alwaysperformed a circle, the President saying that Eire couldnot consider any policy today except in the light ofthe crime of partition, while I said that the prospects of readjusting partition must be affected by the policyof Eire today.Reverting to the question of liaison andthe clearing up of difficulties I said that in the lasthour before I left Whitehall a grave difficulty hadbeen created by the presentation of an aide-memoire onthe subject of neutrality presented by the HighCommissioner for Eire.      It was fulljr understood thatEire had adopted a policy of neutrality and theemphasising of that policy in general terms must beexpected.      But this rigid aide-memoire, dotting the&quot;i&apos;s&quot; and crossing the &quot;t&apos;s&quot; in the way of stringent rulesaffecting British ships and aircraft had been read withprofound feelings of disappointment.      The Presidentassured me that his intention was to be helpful.     Hehad wanted to oblige us by having strict rules aboutsubmarines.      He understood that that suited us.      Ifhe had an order about submarines his critics regardingthat measure as entirely anti-German would at once ask

what he had done? about ships&apos; and .air-craft.    How could he escape from having rules as a guide in practice?He had pressed his legal advisers to draft the rules onthe most generous lines consistent with the convention of 1907e    To him the rules appeared not unhelpful to us.He had already communicated the aide-memoire to Germanyand to Prance.    I begged that the aide-memoire shouldnot be published,,   These restrictive rules in thatcrude form would excite much feeling in England,particularly in view of our action in surrendering theIrish ports so recently,,    It would be adding toMr. Chamberlain&apos;s difficulties.    This argument evidentlytouched the President at once.    He expressed thedeepest admiration for and sympathy with the PrimeMinister.    He said &quot;He has done everything that a mancould do to prevent this tragedy11.    Accordingly I asked that action on the aide-memoire should be deferred andno rules promulgated till London had a chance of considering theme I ventured to add that I had knownmany cases of a pronouncement of this kind binding action for the future in a field of policy, but I had neverknown one that had not been regretted.    Why tie his hands?    He could say and do all he liked about neutralityand wait on events.    Mrc Walshe told me later that he thought the President was impressed by this view and that possiblyno orders would be promulgated.    In any case he felt sure that prior reference &quot;would be made to London.    He gaveme a copy of the Emergency Powers Order, 1939s as it now stands in draft and it is attached.The President in discussing the need for suchrules had referred to an incident at Skerry when one ofour military planes had come down.    Its departure^Not reproduced,&apos;   -11-

S?9Bfacilitated by the arrival of another plane, had been allowed, without interference and the news had beensuppressedo    But comment in Eire had been widespread^How could this continue?   If he enforced rules againstsubmarines what answer would he have to the Germansabout our planes?By a strange coincidence the telephone rangand the President said &quot;There you areo   One of your-planes is down in Ventry Bay.   What am I to do?   Hesaid that possibly something might be done in the way of transferring the ownership of the plane to Eire a but hewould have to intern the crew*    It was quite obviousthat he found this course most unpalatable.    I said, thatin view of the Skerry precedent he should warn theBritish Government before introducing any procedure of internment in such cases.    The men concerned had probably had no warning of any such possibility.    ThePresident was greatly disturbed in mind and we were bothmuch relieved when the telephone rang again an hour later to report that the plane had managed to get away - or rather&apos; had been allowed to get away0    Clearly problemsof this kind lie ahead of us.On the subject of the neutrality of EireMre de Valera said, that two-thirds of his people werepro-British0 or at any rate anti-Germans at the moment.But there was a very active minority0    Personally hehad great sympathy with England to-dayG    But though thecause of Poland was our casus belli the reasons for the breach went deeper than that and motives which affectedEngland could not affect Eire.I said that England to-day had no war aims of a selfish character.    We were no great admirers of the

-Treaty;jx  JLerjaailles.     It had seemed to us that in thisstruggle at last there was an ideal for which England, andEire could stand together and that from thai;, associationa new chapter in our history would start.      h.?n  de Vaieratook this as a text for reviewing the failures of thepast when Ireland had sought to gain England? s goodwillhy patience and co-operation, for instance the failureof all Redmond&apos;s efforts.     And thus we travelled, backto the Partition of Ireland.     Why did not our PrimeMinister put his foot down and stop the follies and.oppressions of Northern Ireland?     Look at who.&quot; a pJcx-urewe might have!     A united, independent Ireland/      think of the effect in America where the Irish element, hadruined and would ruin any possibility of Anglo-Americanunderstanding]     Why could-we not see where the flaw inour armour lay?     It was not a matter of religion,      the protestant minority in Eire to--day were happy and contented.The Northern Ireland element would be of real use toEngland as a part of the whole body politic of the island.The petty tyrannies and oppressions now go::-.ng on inNorthern Ireland must lead to d.icaster.      &quot;If I livedthere&quot;, he exclaimed with heat,  &quot;I should, say f15II bedamned if 1111 be ruled by these people&apos;&quot;.He went on to voice the fear that if the war went- on for long the danger of a physical clash between the rivalforces in Ireland could not be averted.      He gave me tounderstand that he considered the rulers of NorthernIreland were seeking to provoke a conflict.      !&apos;My friends in America say to me &apos;Why don&apos;t you take a leaf out of hitler&apos;s book and work the Sudeten-Deutsch trick, inNorthern Ireland?&apos;&quot;.I said that the British Government had. * ---&quot;fxIc-Sent&quot;i,ystrong influence over Northern Ireland  &apos;;c prevent anytrouble being fomented from that end.      He seemed dubiousOn the wall next to the map of Eire there hung a mapof Europe and speaking of the difficulties created by the

Partition of Ireland I enquired what position would arise in our island group if Ireland &quot;became the complete independentunit of his dreams?     England with its dense population, itsdependence on import and export and safe trade routes, Irelandwith its dependence on the English market - did it seem tohim rational that this strategic group could he partitioned?Their foreign policy must surely be one and undivided.     Thequestion of the Eire ports and of the Northern Ireland ports wasvery relevant.     The President hesitated,     He said that nodoubt the common interest would prevail but he did not pursue the argument.     Nor did I expect that he would.I raised the question of submarines and the menace toIrish seaborne trade arising therefrom, but Mr.  de Valeraevidently at present does not wish any consideration toobscure his vision of neutrality.    The only line possible .at present is to retain his&apos; goodwill and to render hisneutrality as benevolent as possible.I suggested that Ireland stood to gain a good deal fromthe war but he said there would be disappointment there as our tariff retaliation policy had damaged the fabric of the farming industry.      There cannot be much in this argument.We spoke of the system of watch and ward which he had established on the coast t&apos;o look out for encroachment bysubmarines.      He said he could not deny the possibility of aGerman submarine receiving assistance but he would do his utmost to prevent it.      This does not sound very reassuring.We have no contact with his coastal watch.      We may have difficulty in obtaining it as he said a word to me aboutEire not wishing to have the burden of our secrets.Go-operation in intelligence cannot work on that formula.

&apos; ill)He spoke with feeling on the subject of I.R.A,bombing activities in England.     He could not believe thatthe outrages at Coventry were committed by Irishmen.Was it not possible that an aeroplane carrying bombs had had a mishap?     I said that there was no such possibility.One or two of his incidental remarks are worth noting down.&quot;There was a time when I would have done anything -in my power to help destroy the British Empire. but now ray position has changed. I can see that a unitedand independent Ireland might well find relationship withits Moreover there is a change in spirit. I felt that very strongly in the discussions of 1937. And there arestrong and growing racial ties.&quot;He referred with pleasure to Mr. Anthony Eden&apos;visit to Ireland and to his talks with him and said hewas gladvthat he was at the Dominions Office.&quot;For some extraordinary reason or other EdwardVIII was popular over here.      If he had been King at thetime of his abdication you would have had trouble inIreland.      Queen Victoria is very much disliked.&quot;At the end of our talk Mr. de Valera revertedrather more warmly to the question of United kingdom representation.     He said again that looking at it formno other angle than that of security he felt that thecreation of a post of special status or character wouldbe dangerous.      The appointment of a Minister wouldinvolve no such risks.     His answer to any criticismswould be complete and acceptable.      &quot;After all there isa German Minister.     Do you want me to boycott GreatBritain&quot;.

He asked me to tell the Prime Minister that hewould agree to a Minister.      I said that I would deliverhis message hut that I was given to understand in london that consideration had been given to his suggestion andthat it had not been found possible to overcome theconstitutional difficulties.      There was some talkbetween him and Mr. YTalshe who then came in about &quot;quibblesat a time like this51.      I suggested that the quibble mightbe on their side but the President said &quot;Noa      It is amatter of internal politics&quot;.I took my leave after a conversation which hadbeen very natural and easy, and certainly-more cordialthan I expected.     My visit may have done some good inopening his eyes to the difficulties and embarrassments hemay cause in &quot;whitehall and Dublin if he issues formalorders under his policy of neutrality without previouslyfeeling his way with us.(Intd.)     j.
