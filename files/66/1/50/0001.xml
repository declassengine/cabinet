Weekly Report (Wo.-3) of Air Operations and Intelligencefor. the week ended  Midnight,24th September1939. -German Air Force B1.. A German official communique&quot; stated that the german air Force completed operations in Poland on the 18th September*There has.not since been any indication of a general move of airunits to the west,  and the probability is that the units whichhave been operating in Poland are being re-fitted at their homestations.Operations in Poland.2. Evidence received since the last report was renderedconfirms the effect produced by the German air attacks on Polishmilitary and civil headquarters, and makes clear the very important contribution made by these attacks towards&quot; the breakdown in control.     The German Air Force appears to have obtainedinformation about the new locations of Polish GovernmentDepartments and Military Headquarters within 24 hours of movesbeing made.     The departments and the headquarters were each timeheavily bombed and forced to move again, with the result thatcommunications were almost continuously dislocated.Operations by Frenah Air Forcey3e French aircraft have made day and night reconnaissance flights behind the Siegfried Line.     The aircraft have been of oldtypes and they have not been well matched against modern Germanfighters;    up to the 18th September the French had lost elevenaircraft.. &apos;.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.4. Reconnaissances in IT or th West Germany.     A number ofdaylight reconnaissances have been made to establish the densityof traffic on the roads and railways over specified routes from/the

the north-east to the west of Germany,,     Weather conditions wereunfavourable and the opportunities for taking photographs were limited, hut indications were that there was no abnormalactivity in the areas reconnoitred,,     The oppositionencountered was slight and no losses were suffered!    such attacksas were made by German fighters were not pressed home, althoughit is believed that one German fighter was shot down.5. Operations against the German Fleet.   Recoanaissanceshave been made in the Heligoland Bight to locate any Germanwarships which might be at seae     A bomber force was heldimmediately ready to make attacks on any suitable targetsdiscovered by the reconnaissance aircraft, but no opportunityfor- operations occurred.6. Propaganda.     The War Cabinet, at their 17th Meetingheld on the 16th September, concluded (17th Conclusions, Minute9) that the leaflet dropping campaign should be continued, notnecessarily at regular intervals but when thought desirable.In accordance with this decision a propaganda-carrying operation was made on the night of the 24/25th September.Balloon Unit.    It is expected that No. 1 &apos;M&apos; BalloonUnit, which is located in France for the despatch over german territory of propaganda leaflets attached to balloons, willbe ready for operations within a few days.Coastal Command.7. Routine patrols over the North Sea have been continue during the week.     They have been re-organised to includeoccasional offensive patrols to counteract possible enemyopposition, and with the object also of releasing, for other duties, five British submarines which had maintained the outerlimits of the patrol line..As

As a result of intensive anti-submarine patrols,particularly in the Western approaches, sixteen U- boats have fee en...sighted from the air, and ten of these were attacked.     Direct hits were reported on three U- boats, and the evidence with regard to four other attacks is that bombs dropped so close to the submarines that they cannot have escaped damage.Two flying boats, while engaged on anti-submarinepatrol in the Western Approaches, received an S.O.S. callfrom the s.s. &quot;Kensington Court&apos;- which had been torpedoed.The flying boats arrived over the position of the sinkingsteamer ten minutes after she had been hit:      they landed,picked up the 34 survivors from the steamer, and returned safelyto their base.During reconnaissance and patrol flights, enemy aircraft have been sighted on six occasions, but no majorencounters have taken place.     On one occasion, the patrollingaircraft was about to attack a German flying boat when fire was opened from the flying boat.     Two bullets struck the Royali*ir Force aircraft and one of these killed the pilot;      thenavigator took control and flew the aircraft safely home.Advanced Air Striking Force8. The ten Medium Bomber squadrons making up the firstechelon of the Advanced Air Striking Force in France are nowup to full strength, with the exception that the mechanical transport for some of the units is still en route.The Wings of the second echelon are available to movewhen ordered to do so, but their movement could not now takeplace before the 9th October.Reconnaissances have been made over the Western/Fr ont

Front area to give Royal Air Force crews experience of localconditions.Royal -ri-ir Force Component of the Field Force9. The Headquarters of the Royal Air Force component of the Field Force are now with G.H.Q. in France.
