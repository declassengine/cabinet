ANNEX.Detailed reports by the United Kingdom Delegation onthe conversations which we have had with the French since last March are available in the records of the CommitteeOf Imperial DefenceoThe following is a summary of the general course that these conversations have taken..First Phaseo2.       This was carried out in London, in two stages,(29th March - 4th April, 1939    and   24th April - 3rd May,1939) and the results may be summarised as follows:-(i) An agreed bread strategic policy for theconduct of war in Europe, including thesituation created by our guarantees to poland, Roumania, Turkey and Greece, andthe effect of possible Japanese intervention,was drawn up.(ii) An agreed broad policy was drawn up for theconduct of Naval operations and the broadlines upon which operations in theMediterranean, North Africa, Middle East,Red Sea, &quot;-vest and East Africa and the far east should be conducted.(iii) A study also was made of possible Germanoffensives against France, Belgium, Holland,,and Switzerland and agreement was reached on the conditions likely to obtain.Second Phase. (4th - 6th May, 1939).5.       The second phase of our Conversations with the Frenchwas a series of conferences between British and FrenchCommanders abroad.    These conferences tackled localproblems within the terms of the policy agreed inLondon in the first phase.    It is difficult to summarisethe results of each conference in a short note of this nature, but the following might be of use:-

(a) In North Africa.The French intentions in&apos;respect of operations in North Africa and the role of our own troops in Egypt havebeen discussed and co-ordinated.(b) In the Middle East.Anglo-French co-operation in Syria and palestine was agreed upon at aConference at Jerusalem0(c) Anglo-French action in the Red Sea area andin East Africa was agreed at a Conference&apos;at Aden.     Plans for action against theItalian East African Empire are wellunder way,(d) The action in the Far East was discussed at aconference at Singapore, and considerable progress   was made in the co-ordination ofplanso     The only major point outstandingin this area is the question of the actionto be taken by Allied garrisons in NorthChina which is still being discussed through diplomatic channels with the French and theU.S.A. Governments.      Now that the far eastern situation seems to have improved,this point is of less importance,,(e) West Africa,Contacts have been made in West Africa andare still proceeding,,(f) Contacts between our Commanders in the Sudan andthe French Commander in Niger-Chad are about to take place.Third Phase.    (28th to 51st August, 1959).4. This was a continuation of previous Conversations,but was carried out on the British side by the Officers whohad been designated as the Permanent Military representatives at Supreme War Council Headquarters (see Paper No. W.P.(34)6)

The discussions lasted a week and a number of outstanding details were resolved-,     It was recognised,however, that detailed plans could not be made inadvance for the employment of our Air Force, since thiswas conditioned by the action of Germanye     In thesecircumstances it has not, up to the present, beenpossible for the French and British Permanent military representatives to concert detailed joint plans for theoperations of French and British Armies and Air Forces onthe Western Fronts
