This memorandum was drawn up at ameeting under the Chairmanship of the Attorney-General at which the various departments concerned Admiralty, War Office, Home Office and Foreign Office were represented. It is not designed to make any specific recommendations, butto set out the legal position together with possible courses of action for adoption by His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. The particular interest of the Foreign Office in the matter is that thepolicy adopted should not bk such as to cause difficulties with neutral Powers,more especially the United States of America and Italy, whose goodwill is of paramount importance. The United States Government have already raised thepoint see Washington telegram No. 456 attached. .3. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Washington and Rome have been askedfor their views as to the degree of stringency which could safely be applied indealing with the vessels of the countries in question, and their replies are annexedhereto. In considering their recommendations we must, I think, be guided by our estimate of the comparative military advantage which we would obtain bythe most drastic action as against the possible dangerous effects of such action onour relations with these neutral Powers. This being the case, I am strongly ofopinion that we should follow the suggestion made in Lord Lothian&apos;s telegramNo. 525 that the only persons to be removed in addition to Category (2) (seeparagraph 6 of the memorandum) should be those in Category (3), whose activities can be reasonably shown to be of importance to the enemy war effort, or who can be shown to be enemy agents.4. Sir P. Loraine, in his telegram, reports that the Italian Government are willing to refuse passages to Europe to Germans in the prohibited categories onthe understanding that the same rule is applied to all belligerents. They draw attention, however, to the difficulty of identifying those in the various categories.10588   [20037] b
I think that this point might be met by informing the Italian Government thatall males from say 18-55 would &quot;be liable to removal. This would mean that acertain proportion of elder technicians might escape, but the number must be small, and I would propose in addition to reserve onr right to remove notoriousagents of any age or sex.5. As regards enemy nationals who are officers and members of the crew of neutral vessels, I think that we should proceed with the greatest caution, moreespecially in view of what Lord Lothian says in paragraph 1 of his telegramNo. 525, and I suggest that we should confine ourselves to the procedure suggestedin paragraph 2 of the Attorney-General&apos;s note.6. As regards the more general application of these measures, I would recommend as follows :  (i) For the present at any rate, the great bulk of Germans whom we mightwant to remove will be proceeding towards Germany, and it is obviously easier to justify action in that case than in others. To start with, therefore, at any rate, our action might well be confined to vesselsinward bound to European ports (see Lord Lothian&apos;s last paragraph).Most of such ships will be sent in to British ports for contraband control in any event, which should facilitate dealing with some ofthe points mentioned below. On outward-bound vessels and vesselstrading between non-European ports we should, so far as it may benecessary to take action at all, confine ourselves to particular caseswhere we have reasonable evidence of the noxious character of theindividual concerned, such as the notorious agents already mentioned,(ii) So far as possible we should avoid removing enemy aliens from shipson the high seas. There is less chance of objection if action is takenin ports to which the ships have been sent for examination or forother reasons.(iii) The last paragraph of paragraph 6 of the memorandum is, in theopinion of the Foreign Office, dangerously wide (see paragraph 1 ofthe Attorney-General&apos;s note). This point would be more easily dealtwith if suggestions (i) and (ii) above were adopted and detention&quot; onsuspicion confined as far as possible to males of military age. if great care is not exercised on this question, it.may altogether destroy the good effect on neutral opinion of such limitation as it is decidedto adopt.7. Finally, we should not make a public statement of our intentions. the desired object of discouraging neutral ships from carrying enemy aliens can probably and should be effected by discreet intimations to the principal neutral governments and shipping lines. These intimations need not be too precise, andit is to be anticipated that a hint of the liability of males between certain age limits would do much to discourage intending German travellers. There would be nothing to prevent each communication being couched in the terms best suited tothe country concerned.H.Foreign Office, September 25, 1939.
Memorandum.A DECISION is required on the policy to be adopted in regard to the treat-ment of enemy aliens found on board neutral ships:2. This question was considered at an interdepartmental meeting on the11th September under the chairmanship of the Attorney-General, at which theDepartments concerned (Admiralty, War Office, Home Office and Foreign Office)were represented.3. The following was agreed to be the position under international law asregards the removal of enemy nationals from neutral ships met with on the high seas or sent into a British port.*(i) There is no doubt that persons actually embodied in the armed forces ofthe enemy may be removed from neutral vessels,(ii) As-regards reservists, the meeting considered that the law should beconstrued as including these, though it is admitted that this inter-pretation is not so generally recognized as is (i).(iii) As regards men of military age not included in (i) and (ii) above, their removal would represent a further extension of the principle in (i),which might be justified by reason of conditions of universalconscription in Germany.(iv) A fourth category to be considered is that of enemy agents not includedin (i), (ii) or (iii). This was the contention which we, in effect,abandoned in the China case, and obviously creates a difficulty. on general principles, if there is to be any extension, at any rate, certainclasses of agents whose activities are directly related to the prosecution of the war might well be regarded as properly included under thegeneral principle nt the foundation of (i).(v) Technicians not included in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv).   This is again beyond any principle accepted in the past, and it would obviously cover a very wide field. There might be exceptional technicians whom it mightbe worth the risk of trouble to detain.4. The practice adopted in the United Kingdom since the outbreak of thepresent hostilities has been to detain officers and N.C.O/S, whether on the activelist or reservists, officials, experts and technicians connected with munitions or public services (excluding diplomats and consuls), and, of course, enemy agents.It will be seen, therefore, that we have not been detaining men of military age who do not fall within the above categories. Whatever the law may be, therefore,neutrals would have a legitimate complaint if we applied more stringentprinciples to enemy aliens on neutral ships than if they were resident in thiscountry. In fact, none of the representatives of the Service Departments attachedmuch importance to the rank and file returning to the enemy country without having taken part in hostilities. Importance was, however, attached to enemyagents and skilled technicians as defined above. The question is, therefore,whether the right of removal should be claimed in respect of enemy agents andcertain technicians, and, if so, what terms should be employed to describe thosewhom it is desired to detain.5. Telegram No. 456 from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington (acopy of which is attached) shows that the United States Government are objectingto the incident there set out chiefly on the grounds that a repetition of suchoccurrences would have an unfortunate effect on American opinion.Mr. Sumner Welles, of the State Department, appears to have suggested that wehad not the right to remove any German nationals, though he stated that he didnot want to discuss the legal aspect. Mr. Welles&apos;s contention would appear to be wrong, but it might be taken as an indication that the United States are not likely readily to agree to extension, and it is reasonable to assume that italy would take the same line.* Neutral ships which enter a British port of their own accord may presumably be regardedas thereby subjecting themselves to British jurisdiction so far as concerns enemy aliens onboard. This corresponds with the view maintained by His Majesty&apos;s Government as regardsjurisdiction in peace-time, though it is not universally recognised.[20037] b 2
6. Having regard to the position as set out above, the possible courses to beconsidered may be formulated as follows :-(i) It may be thought desirable at the moment to refrain from any actionwhatsoever in order to avoid matters of controversy with the UnitedStates and Italy. It was generally felt that this course, if adopted,should only be regarded as a temporary expedient, pending thecrystallisation of United States opinion on the question of the amend-ment or repeal of the existing neutrality legislation,(ii) Removals might be confined to officers and n.c.o&apos;s on the active list, orreservists,(iii) In addition to the above, there might be included agents and technicianswhose activities are known to be closely related to the progress of thewar, or(iv) (which would be alternative to and include (iii)) agents and technicianswhose activities or qualifications are of such a character, havingregard to the conditions of modern warfare, and the organisation ofthe German nation for war, as to make them of direct and particularassistance to the enemy.The Admiralty wish it to be borne in mind that, in dealing with enemy subjects resident in this country, no difficulty is experienced in ascertaining theirback history and in deciding whether or not to retain them. On the other hand,practically no information will be available about the antecedents of enemy subjects found on neutral ships, nor will time admit of the ships being detainedwhile investigation is made. . Consequently, it will be necessary, if any policy of removing enemy aliens.is to be effective, to proceed to some extent on suspiciononly, and to detain them until they are proved not to belong to the categorieswhich, are not to be allowed to go back to enemy territory. In this connexion, itmust be borne in mind that enemy aliens found on board neutral ships haveobviously some good reason for incurring the expense and trouble involved inreturning to their own country, and, unless some other good explanation can begiven, it is reasonable to assume that, prima facie, they belong to the categorieswhich are to be retained.7. Both (iii) and (iv) of paragraph 6, if adopted, would have to be supported on the broad ground that conditions of modern warfare make itjustifiable to regard them as within the general principle on which the admittedright to remove members of the forces is based. On the other hand, whileextending old principles in this direction, it might be pointed out that we werenot proposing to exercise our undoubted right to remove the rank and file,although we fully reserve our rights in this respect.8. Special consideration will need to be given to enemy nationals who areofficers or members of the crew of neutral ships. The question whether theyshould be removed is complicated by the fact that the current orders of HisMajesty&apos;s Ships and Contraband Control Bases require them to observe theprovisions of Hague Convention XI, article 6, which says that the officers and members of the crew of a captured enemy merchant ship should not be madeprisoners of war, if enemy nationals, provided that they give a written under-taking not to engage, whilst hostilities last, in any service connected withoperations of the war.The Air Ministry are understood to have issued similar instructionsconcerning the treatment of the crews of captured enemy private aircraft.It would seem to be inviting virtually unanswerable protests from neutralsto treat enemy members of the crews of their ships more strictly than enemymembers of crews of enemy ships. Any anomaly in this connexion would onlybe avoided either (a) By running the risk of allowing valuable enemy aliens to slip throughby persuading a neutral shipmaster to sign them on as members ofhis crew; or(&amp;) By deciding, at once, not to give enemy members of the crews of enemy merchant ships the option to sign the undertaking provided for inThe Hague Convention.
In the last war this provision of Hague Convention XI became a dead letterat an early stage, and enemy members of the crews of neutral vessels were removed and interned, if they were of military age, just as were enemy passengerson neutral vessels.. It is suggested that alternative (b) would be the better solution to thedifficulty. We could perhaps justify its adoption on the presumption that any undertaking given by enemy nationals would be of extremely uncertain value;such action could not be justified as a reprisal since we have, as yet, no indication of the attitude which the enemy intend to adopt towards the crews of our merchant ships. If this were done, we could retain all enemy officers and members of the crew of captured enemy vessels and such enemy officers or members of the crews of neutral vessels as fell within the categories which it is decided to remove asa general rule. It might be advisable, as a sop to neutral opinion, to give HisMajesty&apos;s Ships discretion not to remove an enemy officer or member of the crew of a neutral vessel if his continued presence was essential for the proper workingor navigation of the ship. It will also be for consideration whether enemy aliensremoved in this way, and particularly those from neutral vessels, should be interned rather than be made prisoners of war. The practical difference willprobably be so slight that the simplest thing will be to make them prisoners ofwar in every case in the interests of simple administration.Note by the Attorney-General.I have approved the above memorandum, but have the following comments tomake upon it: (i) The final paragraph of paragraph 6 might be construed as authorisingremoval on the high seas of all, or practically all, enemy nationals inorder to investigate. This I think goes beyond what could reasonably be justified vis-a-vis neutrals. In the case of ships sent into port forother reasons there would be opportunity for investigation. Theinstructions issued in regard to ships on the high seas would require careful framing in the light of the decision taken on policy. I think there is much less likelihood of objection if action on the high seasis avoided.(ii) With regard to paragraph 8, I think that the disregard at this stage of The Hague Convention provision in order to be able to take the suggested action towards neutrals would probably raise protests fromneutrals difficult to. answer. If there is reason to suppose that an individual is not a bona fide member of the crew, but has been signed on for the purpose of getting back to Germany, I see no objection totreating him in the same way as other enemy nationals are treated.
ANNEX I.The Marquess of Lothian to Viscount Halifax. (Received September 9.)(No. 456.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, September 8, 1939.UNDER-SECRETARY of State told me to-day that American 1,000-tonliner Santa had been stopped north of Curacoa by one of His Majesty&apos;s ships.Boarding officer had enquired if there were any enemy nationals on board, and captain of liner had apparently gained the impression that if there had been theywould have been removed. Boarding officer, however, accepted captain&apos;s assurance that no Germans were on board and no question of removing anybody thereforearose.Even so Mr. Welles, while implying that suggestion that His Majesty&apos;s ships had the right to remove German nationals from American ships was contrary to international law, expressly stated that he did not wish to discuss this aspect ofthe question, or indeed to make any official representations. He did, however,wish to emphasise his opinion that any repetition of such incidents would have very unfavourable effect on American opinion.I understand law is correctly stated in 78th [ ? ] article in British Year Bookof International Law of 1924, and that a belligerent vessel has the right to stopand search a neutral vessel and remove all enemy subjects who are personsembodied in armed forces of the enemy &quot; or in our view notorious enemy agentsas well, as in China case. Action of boarding officers enquiring whether anyGermans were on board would therefore seem to have been perfectly correct.At the same time I agree with Mr. Welles that such incidents are likely to arouse hostile criticism in American opinion, which would not appreciate nicetiesof international law, and it is obviously highly undesirable at the present moment to do anything which might prejudice American sentiment against us. In ourown interests, therefore, I think we should stand to gain more, if His Majesty&apos;s ships interpreted their instructions liberally and only stopped American shipswhen apart from any question of actual contraband- they had real reason tosuspect that there wore on bocircl enemy nationals who were either actuallypersons &apos;&apos; embodied in armed forces &apos;&apos; of enemy or notorious enemy agents ofsome importance.At the same time it is obviously important we should not do anything toimpair what we regard as our rights under international law, I should, therefore,like to be able to tell Mr. Welles : (1) That we regard the law as indicated above, but that(2) Without in any way prejudicing our rights I could give him an informalassurance that apart from questions of contraband control HisMajesty&apos;s ships were not likely to take similar action with regard to american ships in future unless they had genuine reason to believethat there were on board Germans who were either &quot; embodied inarmed forces &apos;&apos; of enemy or notorious agents of importance.ANNEX II.The Marquess of Lothian to Viscount Halifax. (Received September 21.)(No. 525.)(Telegraphic.) Washington. September 20, 1939.YOUR telegram No. 549.I would suggest that our claim to deal with enemy aliens on board neutral ships should be based on the German Government^ decrees embodying the wholecivilian population into [ ? group omitted Jed formation under &quot;orders of theState. If it becomes clear to American public opinion that the blockade is our main weapon against Hitlerism and that the rules of earlier wars will have to be
extended to meet the new conditions, serious difficulties can probably be avoided,provided we do not ask the consent of the State Department to our regulations or enter into legal arguments, and provided that the powers are tactfully usedjCourses 1 and 2 probably raise no difficulties, provided that there was no doubt about the military character of the &quot; reservists.&quot; In the case of courses 3 and 4,the United States Government might not object to the removal, from Americanships of notorious German agitators proceeding, say, to South America, but theymight well protest against the removal of technicians who were proceeding to ordinary civilian employment-in particular the removal of members of the crews of American vessels who may be of German origin, but who have no intention of leaving the ships during their stay in foreign ports, would certainlyo invoke serious irritation.ST .2. I would recommend, therefore, that, for the time being at all events, theonly persons to be removed from United States ships in addition to category should be those in category 3 whose activities can be reasonably shown to be ofimportance to the enemy war effort, or who can be shown to be enemy agents.3. I would prefer not to discuss the question as a matter of principle withthe State Department, or adopt the suggestion made in the last sentence ofparagraph 4 which would entail a discussion &quot;of &quot;prohibited categories,&quot; butif our action is called into question, to give general and informal assurance that,like the United States Government, we are anxious to avoid disputes or legalarguments and that we can be relied upon only to remove from United Statesships those Germans who are notorious agents or who we are genuinely satisfiedare assisting or intend actively to assist the enemy. If, in particular, seriousprotests were raised, we could, without discussing the question before us, alwaysrelease some of the individuals unless evidence could be produced of their activeenemy agency. .4. It would have an excellent effect if we could add that, as far as possible,His Majesty&apos;s Government would refrain from searching American ships between united States ports and South and Central America, reaching areas coveredby the United States navy patrol.ANNEX   III.Sir P. Loraine to Viscount Halifax. (Received September 21.)(No. 925.)(Telegraphic.) Rome, September 20, 1939.YOUR telegram No. 501.In the conversation between the counsellor and Count Vitetti, reported inmy telegram No. 894, the latter referred to the question, which, however, hesaid was being formally submitted to you through the Italian Embassy in London,of the position of German subjects carried on Italian liners. The Italian Govern-ment would consider sympathetically any practical proposals we might putforward on the understanding that the exclusion of specified categories of persons from passengers on Italian liners would have to be applied equally to belligerentson both sides.2. The points raised in your telegram No. 501 were discussed to-day by thecommercial counsellor with Signor Giannini, the head of the Economic Divisionof the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Signor Giannini said that, if he could beinformed of the precise categories of German subjects liable to removal, andif it was in practice possible for the steamship agents to identify personsbelonging to those categories, he would issue instructions to Italian shipping lines to refuse them passage to Europe.As regards your classification (2) they would have no means of identification-tion beyond the particulars shown on their passports : apparently the only practical course open would be to refuse passages to all male subjects of
belligerent States between specified limits of age. As to (3) and (4) he saw no possible means of identifying such persons, who would, m the majority ofcases, be either women or men above fighting age.3. The Italians are evidently preoccupied in the first instance by thenecessity of being in a position to reply to the eventual German charges of departure from strict neutrality. They have shown no disposition to resent our control,and they have given me no reason to believe that the removal of German subjects from their vessels would create any genuine hostile reaction, though a certainagitation must be expected from the press.
