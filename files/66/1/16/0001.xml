8th September, 1909.Sir,The French Ambassador asked to ^ee methis afternoon and said that he did so on M.Daladier&apos;s instructions,2.   The first point the Ambassador raisedwas that of tiie possibility of immediatelysending a measure of assistance to Poland. M.Daladier was greatly impressed with the necessityof doing something to sustain the Polish moraleeven if the military value of any action v/e could take was not very great.   He had accordingly decided to send fifty aeroplanes by ship to poland and the French Ambassador understood that these were to be shipped as soon as possible from Dun-kirk and Marseilles.   He di d not know by whatroute they v/e re to be sent, but he presumed thatthe fact that some were being shipped at Dunkirkmight imply that it was hoped to get that ship-ment through the   Scandinavian States.5.   The French Ambassador at Bucharest had informed the French Government that the RoumanianForeign Minister had told, the German Charged&apos;Affaires at Bucharest quite definitely that,while Roumania intended to be neutral, she wasnot going to stop the transit of war material-provided this was not

done in a way to conflict with the provisions of the relevant international conventions.4.     M. Corbin told me that he understood thatthe shipments were to be made as soon as they couldbe got ready,and that the intention was to provideaeroplanes to be flown by Polish pilots.5.     He, himself, speaking personally, would have preferred to see the aeroplanes flown there as time was of such importance, and he did not know whatestimate might be in the mind of the French Govera-ment as to the time required for the delivery ofthis material in Poland by the sea route.6.     I told the Ambassador that I would at oncecommunicate the information that he had given me and the hope expressed by M. Daladier that we should feel able to take some similar action, to the WarCabinet.   I assured him that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfully realised the importance attaching topsychological considerations of Polish morale andthe like, but it was no doubt necessary to strike a balance between those considerations on the one handand on the other the desirability of doing nothing to weaken cur strength for the main purpose - whichwas the defeat of Germany.&apos;7.     M. Corbin on his side of course veryreadily appreciated these arguments,   butfelt that the effect produced, even ifany aeroplanes sent were lost, would beXXlCOX V*e  o o   o  s  a

likely to outweigh all other purely military considerations.    He asked me to let himknow as soon as possible what view the WarCabinet took of the matter.8.   The second point M. Corbin mentionedwas this:   M. Daladier was disposed to thinkthat it would be of great value to have aconsultation with the Prime Minister, or  ifthe subject matter seemed to dictate such acourse, with the Service Ministers-concerned.Such a meeting would, besides havingpractical value, also have the value ofemphasising the solidarity of the two Govern-ments.     He had proposed no exact date, but . Gorbin understood that he thought someearly meeting of the kind would be very desirable.     M. Daladier was prepared tocome half way to meet any British Ministers:by which M. Corbin said that he meant Calais,Boulogne, or even Dover.     1 promised the ambassador that I would put this suggestionalso before the Prime Minister and mycolleagues without delay.-   (Signed)   HALIFAX.
