COURSE OF THE WAR; APPRECIATION&quot;18TE^ SEPTEMBER,,, .195.9 0/0 It is apparent that the military defeat of Polandwill be accomplished in the near future     We have therefore considered it desirable to make a briefappreciation of the possible developments of the war inthe light of the existing situation,.     Things are movingso fast., however? - for example Russians invasion of Polandthat our political assumptions and consequently our military appreciation may? in some respects, be subject to change 0S&amp; There have been various reports and rumours ofinternal unrest in germany     The Germans, however, are adisciplined race, the......s^e,c.ret-j5plice,.J.s powerful and thesuccessful offensive against Poland will tend to counteractany unresto     Some neutral observers have indeed statedthat morale is good*     We therefore exclude the possibilityof German military power being overthrown as the result ofinternal revolution^3* Broadly speaking there appear to be three courses open J:o^our enemy after the defeat of Poland has been achieved:-

((A)   To consolidate her position in Poland and tocontinue to maintain a defensive attitudetowards the&apos;Western Powers.((B)   To leave sufficient forces to consolidate her position In Poland and to direct her maineffort by seaf land and air to the defeat ofthe French and ourselves0(C)   To stand mainly on the defensive in the west and to extend her military and economiccontrol in South Eastern Europe0COURSE &quot;A&quot;.4,        If Germany selects course (A) above, she may attemptto bring the war to an end by immediate negotiation^Whatever form an offer to negotiate may take, we shallassume for the purposes of this appreciation that it wouldbe rejected by Great Britain and France50 It is possible that Germany might then elect to remain on the defensive on both fronts in order to developcommunications with Russia and so strengthen her economicresourceso     The disadvantages of such a policy to germany would be that she would incur a long war, and we are advised that there is little likelihood of her obtaining substantialsupplies from Russia,,     If, nevertheless she should adopt this course, we think that we should continue to blockadeGermany and to build up our resources against the time when we could ourselves adopt the offensive060        Before leaving our consideration of course (A), howeverwe wish to draw attention to certain possible contingencieswhich would have important military implications.     TheRussians are estimated to have mobilised some 90 to 103divisions and 20 Cavalry Divisions in the Westo      Theyhave now crossed the frontier with the ostensible objectof safeguarding the White Russian   and Ukrainian districts of Polando

7.&apos;        Our guarantee to Poland does not in the view of theForeign Office cover aggression by Russia,      ShouldRussia declare war on us? however, our difficulties would be. greatly enhanced.     The number of submarines operating against us would be increased by some200, some of which would be in the Black Sea and some in the far East;     and Soviet air forces might be used to reinforce the German air force.      So long as France continued to fightby our side, however, our strategic position though serious&apos;would not be desperate.     We should have to adopt the samestrategy as already outlined in paragraph 5.Courses (B) and (0).So We now turn to examine Courses (B) and (0), a german attack in the West and a German drive into South-east Europerespectively, under two alternative hypotheses, viz:    Italyneutral and Italy hostile.Course (B) - Italy Neutral.9a The latest information -available is that the germans have at least 116 Divisions mobilised, including S. S. reserve and Landwehr Divisionso      The distribution of the german army on 16th September was believed to be -&quot;Western Front at least 40 Divisions.Central Germany at least 18 DivisionsoEastern Front at least 58 Divisions^Total 116 Divisions.When Germany has completely defeated the Polish Armyit is estimated that she would have to retain in Poland,some 15 Divisions,  though a large proportion of these mightbe of low category.      If Germany has not complete faith inthe compact which we believe she has made with Russia^, she might be forced to retain up to at least 30 Divisions in the

9 7 9Easts       It would, however, he more prudent to base ourcalculations on the first figure^10. If, therefore, Germany intends to turn West she willbe able to draw some 43 Divisions from the Eastern Front,thus maJcing anything up to 101 divisions available for operations in the West.     It is estimated that the Frenchftin a week&apos;s time will have 72 divisions mobilized in France,in addition to fortress troops, the equivalent of 12 to 14Divisions^      Of these, twelve will be required to watch theItalian frontier until the neutrality of Italy is certain.To this number available in France must be added the four divisions of the British Field Force.     Germany will then have considerable superiority in numbers in the West, themore so since she may be expected to form further reserve divisions in the near future which may bring her totalup to 130.11. So far as air power is concerned, Germany would needlittle air effort in the east and would   be able to concentrate the bulk of her air forces in the west.        It is estimatedthat she at present can dispose of over SyiOOO bombers asagainst a combined Franco-British total of some 950.fl   14 additional divisions in North Africa.

I28 The experience of the first fortnight of war hasclearly shown the extend to which the German air force,in close co-operation with the German army, has proved, adominating factor and has enabled-the enemy to over-run the greater part of Poland more rapidly than was expected.The threat of the German air force looms large in the minds of the French, and has been mainly instrumental inrestraining us from offensive action.13* Bearing in mind the German characteristic of concentration on one objective at a time, there are, broadly speaking, two lines of action open to Germany if she intends to attack in the west -(i) To neutralize our air force and concentrate hermain effort both on land and in.the air againstFrancec(ii) To hold the allied armies in the west and try to force a rapid decision against Great Britain byunrestricted naval and air att ack aGerman attack on France.14. If Germany decides on method (i) the initial landattack might take one of three forms6(i) Invasion of France through Switzerland   in thehope of turning the southern flank of theMaginot Line,,     The geographical and strategicaldifficulties make this a most improbable courseof action.(il) Invasion of France across the common frontier,,So far as is known the German Army is not yetfully equipped for a heavy attack on the maginot line.    This course therefore appears equallyimprobable.

There remains:-(iii) Invasion of France through Holland andBelgium.By this means Germany would turn themost formidable part of the Maginot line and would not have to risk heavy casualties in an attack against very strong defences.15, It is estimated that to carry out the attack inthe West Germany will require to transfer from herEastern front 29 divisions for the initial phase, withlh, echeloned behind.      Germany must therefore move atotal of 43 divisions.      Even if not interfered with this movement from East to West could not be completed in under15 days and it would take another 7 days to mount anattack with full artillery support.      This means that anattack could not commence till 22 days after the start ofthe movement.      Indications of preparation for the attackshould be received Ik days before the attack develops.

18* It  seems t-o us   late  inthe year for the Germans to undertake an operation- of this kind, but we must be prepared for it.The only effective means of interfering with Germantroop moves to the West would be air attack on herlines of communication and concentration areas.It is quite possible therefore that Germany&apos;sopening move would be to try and eliminate our airforce by attacks on aerodromes and the aircraft industry.This would be met by our Home Defence forces and bycounter attacks of the British-and French Air Forces.17*     The next task would be to meet the German advancethrough the Low Countries.    There is no possibilityof holding up this attack as far forward as Holland,but it would be in the Allied interest to stem it in belgium.     We understand that the French idea is that,provided the Belgians are still holding out on theMeuse, the French and British armies should occupy the line Givet-Namur, the British Expeditionary Forceoperating on the. &apos; left.      Unless plans are concertedwith the Belgians for the occupation of this line insufficient time before the German advance, it would beunsound to adopt this plan.18*      Alternatively, the French suggest that theBritish Expeditionary force should occupy the Scheldtbetween Audenarde and Ghent, connecting with Belgiantroops at Ghent, the French being on the British right.This position would be parallel to our communications withour present bases.    If our bases were shifted to the

Northern French and Belgian ports, port facilities androads would be inadequate and dangerously exposed to german air attack,19, Unless the present Belgian attitude alters and plans can be prepared for early occupation of the Namur-Givet lines we must press the French to agree to meetingthe GOrman advance in prepared positions on the french frontier.    As a German movemejat thFOiagh &quot;the Low Co-untriescould only be directed against the Allies it is essentialthat the Allied Air Forces should attack it from themoment it startedo    This would mean,  in effect,  that weshould have to bomb any Dutch or Belgiaffli. towns thatcentadne-xl  German troops./

20* Whatever the initial dispositions of the british expeditionary Force we should have to devote all resourcesthat could he spared (see paragraph 16 above) towardsassisting the French to stem the German land advance*At least a large proportion of the German air striking force would certainly be used in full support of their land forces, and it is doubtful whether the French fighter and AoAc defence wo\ild prove adequate to meet the force ofthis attack.      The French would probably press us tosend fighters to France, and there is no doubt that in extreme circumstances we might have to do so.      It would,however, be a matter of the utmost difficulty for administra-tive reasons, and apart from the fact that we should have to weaken the air defence of this country in order to assistFrance, our fighters would only be able to operate with a reduced degree of efficiency if they were transferred toFranceo      In view of the shortage of A.A. guns with theField Force it would be necessary to strengthen the A.A.defences of the overseas base and the communications ofthe Force.21. We have already agreed with the French that in acritical stage of an enemy offensive against France our bomber force would constitute a form of strategic reserve to stem the. invasion.German Attack on Great Britain.22. If Germany adopts the second alternative suggested inparagraph 13, i.e. an attempt to force a rapid decisionagainst Glreat Britain by unrestricted air attack combined with action at sea against our trade, it is necessary to

consider what form this attack would take*     We h.aVcalways   held the view that our greatest danger wouldbe an attack against our supply and distributionsystem, our shipping in the narrow waters, and the ports and the communications whereby imports aredistributed inland.238        Si View hcse^ei? of what has h&amp;gp&amp;BA in B&amp;and jit seemsjcstofcalsle that ojs. a first stop la this plan &quot;germany would attempt to destroy our air force and theaircraft industry, upon which mainly depend our capacity to defend this country and our shipping innarrow seas from air attacks,      If this were to be attempted it might well suit the Allies.      Theenemy would be directing his bomber force against themost heavily and effectively defended portion of theAllied front;    he would inevitably suffer very heavy losses which would reduce his capacity to support the subsequent land attack against Prance;    and thiscourse more than any other is likely to result in the intervention of the United States.24* Our reply to such action on the part ofGermany would be an immediate counter attacks     We donot consider it necessary to define at this stage the exact plans we should adopt for such a counteroffensiveo

9 0M 0Course (C) - Italy Neutral.25. We turn now to consider the alternative situationwhich would arise if Germany, having conquered Poland,decided to extend-her military and economic control to south Eastern Europe, while continuing on the defensivein the West.     Roumania would probably be the nextvictim.      The situation is complicated by the probableoccupation by Russia of the Ukraine0      This may seal any direct advance by Germany on Roumania through Poland, andthe lines of approach open to Germany must then be throughHungary.26. It might be that Roumania would be forced to acquiesce in German military and economic demands withoutwar, in the same way as did Czechoslovakia.      If Roumaniadecided to resist, Germany would require time to reorienther advance through Hungary.     Whether Roumania -resistedor not, the fact remains that Germany would eventuallyoverrun her and reach the Black Sea,  thus obtaining controlof the oil wells and the mouths of the Danube.     no military action that England and Prance could take in thewest would be likely to interfere with her advance, but 1the destruction of the oil wells would be essentialo   Theonly chance of a brake being put on is that Russia may be unwilling to permit German&apos;domination of the shores ofthe Black Sea.27o If the conquest of Roumania represented thelimit of Germany!s Eastern ambitions and had not involvedother Balkan Powers, Great Britain and Prance would still   -have no other immediate choice but to continue economic

pressure and to build up their military strength in theWest until such time as they could take the offensive against Germany.28* If however Germany is looking beyond Rournaniatowards the Bosphorus and the.Aegean, and the brake isnot put on by Russia, we can hope that under the proposed treaty Turkey will be drawn in.     Germany&apos;s difficulties would increase as she advanced and she would greatlyextend her military commitments by having to garrisonthe conquered territories and maintain a long line ofcommunication,,      Turkish forces should therefore be ableto put up considerable resistance provided they receivedadequate armaments particularly for defence against air and tank action,,29o To meet this contingency we should despatchmaterial to Turkey and,if the neutrality of Italy was certain, we might also send troops and air forces fromEgypta      Similarly the French have two divisions in syria earmarked for Salonica which could no doubt be madeavailable to reinforce the Turks in Thrace.     Ultimately,as our strength developed,we should be able to make further contributions to building up a Balkan front.It must not be overlooked that an extensive German drive- to the South East must reduce the forces available against france and make Germany more vulnerable to allied attack in the West.

f-j 0 i-jCourse, (b) - German attack in the &quot;West;    and Course(c) - German drive in the South East - Italy hostile.30. At sea, the hostility of Italy would necessitate the withdrawal of certain light forces now employed in trade protection in the Atlantic, the closing of theMediterranean, and the consequent diversion of shippingvia the Cape0      This would virtually mean that alloperations by land and air would have to be conducted in two widely separated theatres, and would throw a severe strain on our shipping.31, On land the entry of Italy into the war wouldgive Prance another frontier to defend.      It is howevergetting late in the year now for the Italians toundertake an advance over the passes, at any time a difficult operation in which only limited forces could beemployed.      An invasion of Prance by Germany throughSwitzerland would be facilitated by the co-operation of italian forces from the South.      But, as already statedin paragraph 14(i), this is a difficulty military operation and would,  in any event, be impossible during the winter months.32. To sum up if Italy were hostile, the first essential would still be to render ourselves&apos;secure in theWest.     We could then develop   our strategy vis-a-vis Italyon the lines already agreed with the French.      in essence this amounts to an attempt to defeat Italy indetail, commencing with offensives against her colonial possessions.

. Cj U tJ- 4: ; - \53. Turning now to the.effect of Italian hostilityin the event of a German drive into south-east Europe,we should have assumed until recently the participation of Turkey on our side.    In that event we should do our best to build up a Balkan front on the lines contemplated in paragraphs 28 and 29 above, though&apos;: all moves of troops and material would have to be by land,34. There is, however,  another eventuality that hasto be faced, namely, that   Turkey may conclude a pact withRussia and be either neiitral or even actively hostile tous.    In this somewhat desperate situation our effortswould have to be directed towards maintaining a middle east front as well as a Western front.     The. Middle Eastfront would have to face both ways, i.e. a front facingwest against the Italians in Libya, and a front asfar north as possible in Syria against any advance fromthe direction of Turkey.,(Signed)    C.L.N.
