POSITION OF ROUMANIA

REPORT.

Introduction.

1. We have had under consideration a letter from the Foreign Office informing us that our Ambassador in Bucharest has been asked by the French Ambassador there to join in pressing Roumania to make an early declaration of war in favour of Poland and the Allies. He has asked for instructions and the Foreign Office have in turn requested the Committee of Imperial Defence to state whether, in so far as military considerations are concerned the participation or neutrality of Roumania is preferable.

Political.

2. Poland has told Roumania that she would prefer her to remain neutral, and since the Polish-Roumanian treaty is operative only against Russia, Roumania has no moral obligation to assist Poland. A further point is that so long as Roumania remains neutral Hungary may also do so and the chances of a general conflagration in the Balkans is thereby reduced.

Military.nm 11 imm hh^bkwim rifflna ....5. The Deputy Chiefs of Staff at their 37th Meetingon 2nd June, recorded the conclusion (Conclusion 1(a))&quot;that, in the case of a major war againstGermany and Italy, the British cause would. &quot;best he served by Roumania if she were an allied belligerent,, &quot;This conclusion was reached at a time when it was esteemedthat Russia would certainly assist Poland and Roumaniawith war material and might even actively intervene ontheir side.      This conclusion was transmitted to theForeign Office and, in order that there should be nomisunderstanding, we wish to make it clear that it doesnot apply to the altered circumstance 3*4.&quot;        On the 51st August, when the matter was underdiscussion with the French General Lelong, the french army representative expressing his personal views onlysaid thft he \:-vx, in favour of Rounania becoming our Allyat the outset for the following reasons(a) The presence of the Roumanian Army on the. .   right flank of the German main advancefrom Moravia and Slovakia might- embarrassthem.(b) Poland would have a line of retreat opento her into a friendly country, insteadof being crushed out of existence againstthe Russian frontier.( c) It would widen the field of militaryoperations and contain 12 - 15 divisions of German troops which could otherwise be employed against Poland.(d) Only if Roumania were hostile to germany could we hope to s top the latter country from obtaining Roumanian oil.      If Roumaniawere neutral the trade agreement withGermany would be operative.(e) Roumania would prove a batter channel ofsupply to Poland if she was in activealliance with her than if she remained a neutral.

6. As we see it, the advantages of Roumania maintainingher-neutrality are as follows(a) We avoid the humiliation of seeing anAlly overrun and the possibility of givingGermany a cheap success which mighthearten the German people and stiffentheir war morale.(b) Germany could probably draw less food from roumania than she could if Roumania were completely subjugated and her link withRussia wcuchd not be so effective.(c) Having no common frontier Roumania cannotinitially fight Germany except by sendingtroops to reinforce P0land and she has notroops to spare for the purpose.(d) Roumania&apos;s relations with Hungary and bulgaria are strained and a declarationof war by Roumania against Germany would throw Hungary and probably Bulgaria intothe German camp and bring on hostilities in conditions even less favourable to roumania.      If Roumania declares war first,moreover, Hungary would find it difficultto resist the German demand for passage oftroops across Hungary.which General Lelong developed since we feel that they-take insufficient account of the political repercussionsand conseuqent military line up of the -other ^powers which might occur if Roumania declared herself our Ally0It must &quot;be remembered that Roumania is encircled bypotential enemies, namely Russia, Hungary and Bulgaria.,If Roumania declares war every effort will be made byGermany to urge on these enemies to attack RoumanianThe whole of the Balkan countries would then be drawn in and it is unlikely that Italy would continue to remainneutrals

(e) If Roumania declares war on Germany Russia-&apos;is given the opportunity to step in and take Pack Bessarabia^ jdarticularly sincethe... conclusion of the - Soviet-Ge rman Pact-,7. Roumania is. important. for Germany as a source of supply for oil.      If Roumania is neutral Germany will still have difficulty in paying for her requirements in oil.      If Roumania is a belligerent Germany will eventually get oil for nothing unless the Roumanianscan destroy it beforehand.      Even then the oil fieldscan be brought into production again     after a few weeks8. In paragraph&apos;6 (e) above the French stated thatRoumania would prove a &quot;better channel of supply to poland if she was in active alliance with her.      Wenote, however, from Bucharest Telegram No.  347 of1st September, that it looks as if roumania as a neutralwill continue to supply Poland.     We should like&apos; her to guarantee that she will not place an embargo on thepassage of allied supplies to Poland,9.    ,     We are advised that there is little danger of roumanian defection to the German camp since she doesnot want to lose her independency and we argu withthis view.    All the advantages, therefore, appear to usto lie in retaining Roumania as a neutral at the outsetand thus enabling her to enter the war later when she can be adequately supported and when her interventioncan have a direct influence on the outcome.(Signed)    C.I..1T.

ATOTEX*FOREIGN OFFICE,  S.W.1.Ref, No.R 6811/G. - 2-7th August,  1939.33 3S       -   35 .I understand that you are Micely  to he dealingwith the memorandum on the &quot;position of Roumania in Timeof War&quot; which Ingram b ent to porter on 16th August.    that memorandum, you will,remember, suggests that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not dispose of any certain means of compellingRoumania to abandon neutrality in our favour at the outset of a war unless, of course, she is the victim of aggression by the Axis Powers or- Hungary or Bulgaria;    it furthersuggests that we shall have to handle Roumania delicatelyif we are to get the best out of her,2. We received to-day a telegram from Hoare inBucharest (No. 328 of 26th August - copy enclosed) which shows that he has been having some discussion wi th theFrench Ambassador in Bucharest as to the line we shouldtake with Roumania if and when war breaks out.      TheFrench Ambassador states that the French Government regard it as essential that Roumania should come in immediately,and this view has been strongly expressed by General Weygand.5* We are a little surprised at this as only a month or so ago we understood that the French were very anxious that we should treat Roumania gently at first and we hac%I believe, promised to have a further exchange of views with them on this point.

4. Meanwhile you will have seen Hoare&apos;s&apos; telegram-No.317 (of which I also enclose a copy) showing that the poleshave definitely informed the Roumanians that they would not desire Roumanian intervention in the case of a Polish-german war if Hungary were to remain neutral.      This, of course, islikely to fortify very strongly Roumania&apos;s natural reluctance to abandon her neutrality unless she is herself attacked,5. . In these circumstances v/e should he grateful forthe views of the Committee of Imperial .Defence as to whetherthey consider that we and the French should, if war breaksout and Hungary remains neutral, attempt to induce the roumanians at once to abandon their neutrality in our favour;    or whether they share the opinion put forward &quot;byHoare in his telegram No, 528 that, if Italy were an enemy,there might he some advantage in delay.6o For ourselves we think it in the highest degreeimprobable that the Roumanians will &quot;be prepared, providedHungary and Bulgaria remain neutral, to declare war at the outset? whatever we and the French may say.      If they are themselves attacked, the position would of course he quite different.      Nevertheless so long as the French, and british representatives in Bucharest agree that to urge the roumanians   to take this course would not defeat our ownends, we see no reason why they should not, when  the time comes, try to induce the Roumanians to come in at once on our side.7. It will he necessary to concert with the French so soon as we have your views on these points, and it is for

consideration whether you would prefer that we should takethe matter up through the diplomatic channel or wouldrather have this question threshed out in the course of anglo-French staff conversations.Yours sincerely5(Signed)      PHILIP NICHOLS.Mor Cornwall-Jones 3j Dommittee of Imperial Defence.

ENCLOSURE I TO AMNEX.SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION AND CABINEToDecypher0 Sir R. Hoare ^Bucharest)26th August s 1939D. 9o30 p.m.        26th August, 1939,R,  6,4-0 a.m.        27th August, 1933.Ho q 333 o&apos; IMMEDIATE aIn the absence of any indication of final views of HisMajesty&apos;s Government Military Attache&apos;, and I had hithertoabstained from discussing with our French colleague thequestion of. entry of Roumania into a war in which she was notthe direct victim of aggression,,    However French ambassador to whom Minister- for Foreign Affairs had presumably made someistatement similar to that recorded in &quot;my telegram NoB317 told,me today that in order to be able to maintain an Eastern front and munition the Poles, French Government regarded it as .essential that Roumania should come in immediately.,    This view had been strongly expressed by General Weygand when he was herelast May.So I said that my entire personal view was that it was aquestion of correct timing and assuming that Italy was aparticipant in the war and that therefore some weeks would presumably elapse before communication with Roumania via theMediterranean was possible, we should have gained nothing if bythe time we could reach Roumania in adequate force German -troops had arrived at the Black Sea03* I have now discussed the matter with Military Attache&apos;who says that he imagines French conception to be based on

estimate that conduct of a rapid offensive against poland would require 45 divisions; defence of western frontier 40divisionsj destruction of Roumanian army with the assistanceof Hungarians 20 divisions leaving perhaps an inadequateforce for internal security..    In fact active warfare onthe three fronts simultaneously would entail undue risksespecially at this time of trie year,4e I shall he grateful for instructions in order that ourRoumanian Missions may he sure of holding identical languageto the Roumanian Government if the necessity arises.
