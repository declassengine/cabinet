THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AMD KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.BjBji RET.s - GQPY NO.      ^        &apos;Cv. (59) 5iW...A R      CABINET.LAND FORCES COMMITTEEoREPORT 0We were appointed &quot;by the War Cabinet&quot; on the6th September, 1959, to report as quickly as possible onthe size of the Land Forces at which we should aim in thepresent war, and the date of completion of equipment ofthe various contingents, as a basis for the productionarrangements to be made by   the Ministry of Supply.2. The problem which we have had under discussion is so urgent that we have thought it best to bring our conclusions before the War Cabinet for approval at theearliest possible moment.    We have therefore omittedreference in this Report to the reasons underlying these conclusions.,, which can be explained verbally to the WarCabinet by the Members of the Committee o.  ..3. Our recommendations may be summarised as follows :-( i)      That, for planning of all kinds,we should assume   that the war will last for at least three years, and that themaximum publicity should be given to this assumption.WeM.  (39) 6th Conclusions, Minute (l).

i 2 ^(ii)    That, for production planning by theMinister of Supply, the supply on thefull British Army scale of 55 divisions should-be the objective by the end of theSnd year of the war.The total of 55 Divisions is calculated to include the probable effort ofGreat Britain, the Dominions and India^with a reserve of 5 Divisions forassistance to our Allies..(iii)   That supply on the full British Armyscale for at least 20 of these 55Divisions should be the minimumto be produced within the first twelvemonths and that the Minister of supply should do his utmost to increase this minimumt.(iv)    That a Mission under the aegis ofthe   Ministry of Supply should besent immediately to Paris to co-ordinate the supply demand betweenwith the French and ourselves,.We are informed that theFrench are likely to requireassistance in the form of semi-finished materialssuch as forgings and so forth,after the first four months ofwar, but no details have as yet been given, and it may bethat the French can assist us with certain of ourdeficiencies.

(v)     That if the. Minister of Supply is to fulfil the task now recommended, heshould he given(a)    authority to make the necessaryextended factory provision at once:(h)    authority to take steps for the mobilisation of industry on the linesof the last war (an area organisation for the purpose is now in course of establishment by the- Ministry ofSupply);(c)    first priority in regard to labourand materials for this work.(vi)(vii)8ichmond Terrace, s.W.1.8th September, 1939.That the development, of the production programme should be carried out bythe Minister of Supply in the closest   -touch with the Chancellor of theExchequer, the President of the Boardof Trade, the Minister of Labour   and minister of National Service,  in orderthat financial questions such as the dollar-exchange, 1ahour problems, and themaintenance of civil industry and our export trade   may be given due weight.The Minister of Labour wishes usto emphasise the importance of strict adherence to the schedule of Reserved Occupations.That to assist in tiding over the early months of the war, immediate arrangements should &quot;be made, either by  improvisationfrom spare resources in this country or if practicable6 by pur-chase from abroad,for an increase in guns, particularly ofthe heavier calibres..Q   ITChairman.
