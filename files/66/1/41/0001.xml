(Previous THE PRIME MINISTER said that in view of the reference:Wo Mo  (39), fact that the Second Report (War Cabinet Paper9th Con-elusions,    W.P.&apos; (39) 37) prepared by the Land Forces CommitteeMinute 6. )as agreed upon at the meeting noted in the margin.,had only been circulated shortly before the meeting,he proposed that the discussion should be of a preliminary character only, a decision being deferred until Friday, the 82nd September, 1939, when also those members of the War Cabinet who were not presentwould have returned.    He proposed to ask the lord privy Seal, as the Chairman of the Land Forces committees to give a preliminary account of the conclusions whichhad been reached,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that there was alarge, number of defence questions, including questions relating to the dilution of labour, on.which action could not be taken until a decision had been reached asto the extent to which the Land Forces should beincreased.    All sorts of important war work was held up pending this decision, which it was vital the WarCabinet should take as soon as possible,,.    He quiteagreed., however, with the Prime Minister&apos;s view that&apos;for the reason which he had explained it was desirable not to take a decision until the followingFriday.On the last occasion (9th September, 1939)on which this question had been before the WarCabinet, the proposal submitted by the Land ForcesCommittee was that we should aim at (i) raising andequipping on the full British scale at least twentydivisions during the first year, and (ii) securingthe equipment of and potential for maintaining 55divisions by the end of the second year.      At that

meetings &quot;the question had &quot;been raised whether this programme could he secured without adversely affectingour air expansion,,    There had been a general feeling that it was essential that the latter should not in anyway be prejudiced and the Land Forces Committee had accordingly been asked to consider the matter further in the light of the requirements of the three services as a whole.The gist of the present Report was that theCommittee was satisfied that it would be possible withthe resources at our disposal to carry through theexisting air programme, and also the army expansion programme recommended in the Committee&apos;s first Report.He did not propose to refer to the Admiralty programme;,since this raised no special problem, and was notcompetitive with the two other Services.    The Army andAir Force programmes dealt with in the present report should,  in the opinion of the Committee, be regarded as constituting a first phase, and should be increasedlater if this were found practicable as a result ofmore detailed examination of our resources.The information received by the Committeefrom the Air Ministry, Ministry of Labour and NationalService, Ministry of Supply, and the Admiralty (whichhad represented also the requirements of the MercantileMarine) showed that during this first phase it was desirable that there should be both a financialexamination and also a statistical investigation(under the Ministry of Labour and National Service) todetermine more exactly the labour demands which-would arise and to define the problems which would followtherefrom.    The carrying through of these two programmes

need not, however, he held up by either examination,in.view of the fact that both as regards supply and labour .-there was a margin over and above the amount requiredfor carrying through these two programmes.    This conclusion was, of course, conditional upon the Ministry of Supplybeing given the facilities which it required, includingthe dollar exchange required to purchase machine tools and raw materials.    As regards the Air Force programme,the Committee had assumed production at a level of2S550 machines per month, an increase of 550 over thefigure previously aimed at.    This programme the Co mitteeregarded as the bare minimum.    The Committee wereemphatic in holding.the view that it was essentialthat there should be a greater development in aircraft production in Canada than was at present contemplated,notwithstanding the strain that would be involved on the dollar exchange.    They based this view on the contingencythat as a result of air attack there might well be agreat reduction of aircraft production in Europe as thewar proceeded.    If this happened, the large bombers forwhich production in Canada was now planned, and whichcould be flown over the Atlantic, might constitute adeciding factor at the critical moment of the war.Some members of the Committee also consideredthat it was necessary to develop further types of aircraftsuitable for work in close co-operation with the land forces, 1. e.  to provide large numbers of aircraft forharrying troops in trenches and for the prevention ofthe concentration of large mechanised forces in forwardareas.When all was said and done, it must beremembered that our present Air Programme did not do more than aim at attaining parity with the Germans at theend of a period of eighteen months.

9 9 Q0 o oTHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said thathe was in agreement with the statement made by the lord privy Seal? but it was necessary for him to say that he contemplated asking for a further increase in the airprogramme\&quot;In considering the amount of the increaserequired, it would be necessary, first, to haveregard to the requirements of air defence athome which would persist and might wellincrease as the war went on, and also to our needs in other directions (eog0 the Fleet air arm),     It must be also realised that the new programme would not provide the Air Forcecomponent required for a Field Force of55 Divisionso     Moreover, the size of thatcomponent had not yet been settled.      Onthe bright side of the picture, it must besaid that the Germans might be in at leastequal difficulties with the development oftheir own programme for our part we must be careful to avoid a position in whichthe Army requirements for the Field Force were suchas to deplete our own Bomber Force, which indeed it was highly desirable should be increased.The Secretary of State for Mr added that hewas extremely anxious to send an Air Mission to Canadaat the earliest possible moment to arrange forthe training of personnel with the Canadian Government,who had made a most generous offer in this matter,and also to secure an increase in aircraft production inthat Dominion,,

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that as regards theproblem of Arms?- expansion it was necessary on the onehand not to attempt a programme which was impossible ofattainment, and on the other hand to secure an expansionwhich, would constitute a proper contribution by thiscountry to the joint land effort in Prance0      In thisconnection, it should be recalled that at the end ofthe last war we had 100 Divisions, and were turning outaircraft (of a very different kind, of course, to those now in use) at the rate of 3^000 machines a month     Allthe members of the Land Forces Committee were agreed thatthe proper course at the present time would be to adhere to the objective proposed in their first report, namely,a minimum of 20 Divisions In the first year, and the equipment and potential for 55 Divisions by the end of thesecond yearQ      It was highly gratifying that none of theinformation received from Departments had made it necessaryto modify that conclusion,.     As he had already explained,,the Committee regarded a programme of this magnitude as constituting the first phase only, and they thought it important that in acquiring sites for, e0g0 explosivefactories, the Minister for Supply should be permitted to take up sufficient land to allow for subsequentexpansion if later it were found practicable to increasethe maximum figure above 55 Divisionso     For the further expansion of the Air programme and for the details bothof the Air programme and of the Army programme a furtheranalysis of man-power was required,.     Moreover, in the carrying through of those programmes, the Treasury shouldbe given adequate facilities for preventing wastefulexpenditureo      In this connection, it was most important to ensure that decisions could be obtained from theTreasury very rapidly, not only on purely financial mattersbut also on such questions as the dilution of labour,,

Finally, the Committee thought it very important that as soon as possible the Government should make itclear to the country through Parliament or otherwisethat our maximum war effort would not fall short of our war effort in 1918,     At present the country was passing-through a period of disillusionment? and this made it allthe more essential that the public should know the scale ofour intentions, and should realise the great nationaleffort to which we were setting ourselves, an effort inwhich all would need to play their partoTHE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that thereason why the Land Forces Committee had been able toobtain a unanimous report was that they were convinced thatour resources were sufficient both for the Air Forceprogramme and for the Army programme, and that there would thus be no clash between the demands of those two services or of those of the Admiralty,,     There were several reasons why this was so:-(a) Our naval demands would probably be lessthan in the last war;(b) we were aiming now at an ultimate figureof 55 Divisions as compared with the100 Divisions which we had at the end ofthe last war;(c) the population of our country was substantially higher than during the last war?&apos; and we hadthe possibility of employing about 8 million more workpeople than we had then, even though.?as we must remember, an abnormally highpercentage of the present population was in the older age groups*The Committee were satisfied that there would be noimpingement of the demands of one Service on those of another for some considerable time,&apos; and that even at the peak period our resources would be sufficient for thegreat effort which we planned to make.

So far as the Admiralty were concerned- hewould welcome any investigation which theChancellor of the Exchequer might propose inorder to detect any extravagances, and he didnot doubt that the Ministers for the other services would do the same-,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said thatlie fully agreed as to the need for securingeconomy by every possible meanss     He wastalcing an important step in this direction duringthe present week by appointing a highlyexperienced accountant as SssssKKrirgsi Member ofthe Aii&apos; Council *THE FIRST LORD OF THE -ADMIRALTY recalled that at the end of the last war many anti-wastemeasures had been adopted with a view to securingeconomy even in the smallest ways(e.g. in thecase of stationery by using envelopes several times) and he suggested that those measures shouldbe reviewed and brought into operation at once*THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thathe did not in any way wish,to raise an opposingvoice, and was as anxious as any member of theWar Cabinet that our effort should be as great as possible, but it was necessary that the WarCabinet should not seel: to achieve the impossibleBIn this connection, there were two considerations towhich he wished to draw special attention, and

on which he had obtained preliminary figuresfrom his advisers in the Treasury(a)    Oup national war effort in 1918had only been rendered possible bythe expenditure of  1,000 millions,obtained by loans from the UnitedStates, but for which&apos; assistance weshould have had greatly to curtail.our efforto     If expenditure fromfunds derived from American loanswere deducted for 1918, it appeared that we were already spending alarger sum per month than we were doing at the peak period of expenditure during the last war.    This was allthe more striking when it was recalled that at that time substantial inflationhad already occurred, whereas atpresent prices had not risen materiallyoAt the present time our monthlyexpenditure exceeded 210 millionswhereas during the last months of theGreat War our comparable expenditureAmerican loans) was approximately 200 millions per month0     Of that figure  130 millions came from domesticloans, and  70 millions from taxationIn this connection it would be recalled that according to our present budgetioeQ that of last Spring, defence expen-diture from taxation amounted to  80millions per month,(b)   Another vital element to be considered in determining the size of our combinedAir and Army expansion programmes, wasthe call so imposed on our dollar resources.    The programme advocated by the Land Forces Committee contem-plated, during the first year, anincreased dollar expenditure of  80millions, and this figure would beraised still further in the following year&apos;o      It would be realised howvitally the Treasury were interestedin this question, having regard tothe total amount of our potentialdollar resources which he had indicated to the War. Cabinet at themeeting noted in the margin.expenditure from

The Chancellor of the Exchequer acMed that he proposedto circulate a short Note dealing with the questionssummarised above, for consideration by the War cabinet at their Meeting to be held on Friday, 23nd. Sept em-her, 1939.THE PRIME MINISTER said, that he had. been greatlyrelieved on learning of the conclusions rea.ehed by theLand. Forces Committee, since on the previous occasionhe had been doubtful whether it would be possible tosecure the raw materials and. skilled labour requiredto give effect simultaneously to the existing airprogramme and to the Army expansion programme re com-mended by the Committee.   As regards the suggestionreferred to by the Lord Privy Seal, that a public statement should be made of the scale on which weproposer1 to organise our war effort, he had alreadyha^i in mind to make some public statement himself.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ATR inquired whether he might arrange at once for the despatch of theproposed Air Mission to Canada.THE SECRETARY OF S171 ATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that he hoped that the Secretary of State forAir would  consult him before he made his  final a.rra.n&quot;ge-ments, as he had receive&apos;&apos;1 certain advice as to thebest way of ftpproachina the Canadian Government, inthis matter.THE CHANCELLOR OF ^HE EXCHEQUER suggested that,in view of the fact tha.t it was hoped to reach a finaldecision in two days&apos;  time, it would be better if theSecretary of St*te for Air were not, at this stage, to

make definite arrangements for the despatch of theMission,    There would, of course, he no objection,however, to his advancing his provisional plans for thatpurpose.At the conclusion of the discussion the WarCabinet agreed:-(a) to defer a decision on the questions raised in the second Report by the Land ForcesCommittee (W.P.  (39) 37) until the meetingof the War Cabinet to be held on Frmday,22nd September, 1939;(b) that before the meeting of the War cabinet referred to in (a) above, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should circulate a paper (l)comparing our present monthly expenditurewith that at the end of the last war (exclusive of expenditure then financed from Americanloans); (ii) discussing the dollar expenditure involved    in    the proposals of the Land ForcesCommittee in relation to our total dollar resources;(c) to take note that the prime Minister oontemplatedmaking a statement regarding the scale on whichwe proposed to carry on the war on the linesof recommendation (a) as summarised inparagraph 4 of the Second Report of the land forces Committee;(d) that the Secretary of State for Air, inconsultation with the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, should continue to makeprovisional plans for the despatch, at a very early date of an Air Mission to Canada for thepurpose of making arrangements with theCanadian Government for the training of personnel and for the expansion of the aircraft-production industry in that Dominion.
