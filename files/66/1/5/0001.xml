THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO  BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NO.WAR CABINET.CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE.NORWEGIAN NEUTRALITY.REPORT.We have had under consideration Foreign Officeletter No. N.  1764/64/63 of 24th Augusts  1939,    in whichLord Halifax invites our view of the commitments involvedshould a confidential hut formal intimation be made to theNorwegian authorities to the effect that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would regard a German attack on Norway astantamount to an attack on this country.  Lord Halifax? points out that the sympathies of both the Norwegiani Government end the people would be likely to favour theIBritish cause to a greater extent perhaps than in any otherneutral country;    and that the co-operation with Britishblockade measures in the fullest degree compatible withtechnical neutrality might be hoped for from Norwegianprivate interests,  if not from the Governments, providedonly that the average Norwegian was persuaded that hiscountry could,  and would be protected by Great Britain, ifnecessary by force,  against possible German reprisals.2.        We are advised that, on balance,  the importance ofNorway as a wartime source of supply and facilities toGermany will probably be greater than her importance as asource of supply and facilities to Great Britain and herallies.    In particular Germany must necessarily obtain theAnnex.-2-
greater proportion of her essential supplies of swedish iron ore through the Norwegian port of Narvik.A refusal by Norway to continue exporting iron ore from Narvik would have a very large economic effecton Germany.      We think therefore that it seems unlikelythat Germany will initiate any attack on Norway except by way of reprisal and even then only if Norwegianneutrality were to assume such a degree of benevolencetowards the allies as to interfere with iron oresupplies.3, On the other hand Norway derives from the territories of the Allies many essential foodstuffs and industrial raw materials which Germany could notsupply and of which Norway herself holds no large stocks;,      The Allies are thus in a position to exercisevery strong economic pressure upon Norway in war, if his Majesty&apos;s Government should permit the exerciseof this power to its fullest extent compatible with international law in order to compel Norway to stopexporting Swedish iron ore.      In these circumstances it is probable that Germany would wish to institutereprisals, but is is still difficult tc  see thatshe could take any action other than economic and diplomatic without jeopardising an essential source ofsupply.40 We will, however,  consider briefly what formsGerman military reprisals could take.,      A seaborneexpedition in the face of superior British naval forces would be attended by very serious risks.
Any such operations against Norway&apos;s western seabordcan be dismissed as impracticable for this reasomAn operation directed against the Southern coast is lessimprobable owing to the shorter distance but even sowould be a risky undertaking the results of which wouldnot be commensurate with the effort involved.5. Sporadic attacks against Norwegian ports and tradeare more probable, especially in the Southern area whereGerman naval forces would run less risk of interception.Complete protection against submarine attack could not beguaranteed but the attacks themselves could produceno decisive effect.6. As regards air attack, German striking forces couldreach    vulnerable points in Southern Norway from bases inGermany,, and, as a last resort, the Germans mightundertake sporadic air attacks as a form ef reprisal0We can of course accept no commitment for the direct airdefence of Norwegian territory but our offensiveoperations against objectives in Germany could indirectlyreduce the extent of such a threat *7. Apart fro;reprisals the Germans might endeavourto establish either openly or clandestinely, submarineor air bases on the Norwegian coasts.     The Foreign Officeletter refers specifically to the possible seising ofthe Stavanger aerodrome, presumably as a base foroperations against British naval forces and trade in theNorth Sea.     In these circumstances Norway woul? not be likelyto i incur the risk cf losing her aeutssality by taking militaryaction herself even though it would be within her rightsas a neutral to do so.     On the other .hand she might bequite content to afford us facilities fer ejecting the
interests to do if the operations of these german submarines and air forces were producing suf f i.cLeni^fFfec-ttry warrant it.8. It appears therefore that, with the exception of   ,the direct protection of Norway against air attack, allother forms of possible German action against Norway fall into the category of operations which it would be in ourown interest to combat, and which we could undertake witha reasonable chance of success.9. To sum up, therefore -(a) It appears to be in the German interest that Norwegian neutrality should be respected.(b) If, nevertheless, due to the benevolenceof Norway&apos;s neutrality to us Germany institutesmilitary reprisals,  it would be in our own interest to come to Norway&apos;s assistance,except that as regards direct air attack: byGermany our assistance could only be indirect.(c) We therefore see no objection to a confidentialcommunication being made to the Norwegianauthorities in the sense suggested by lord halifax so long as it is clearly understoodthat no assistance as regards direct art-attack can be given,(Signed) O.L.N.

JItjo. N 1754/64/65.Foreign Office,S.W.I.24th August, 1939.Sir,I am directed by Viscount Halifax to inform youithat he has had under consideration the,means available forencouraging laro-British elements in Norway and thusinfluencing the general attitude of the Norwegian authoritiesin the event of war.2.        The reactions of the Norwegian Government andNorwegian public opinion towards the blockade policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government are likely to be of great importance inview of Norway&apos;s geographical position and of her shippingand other resources.     His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Oslo hasreported that the sympathies both of the Government and ofthe people would be&apos; lilcely to favour the British cause, toa greater extent perhaps than in any other neutral country;and that co-operation with 3ritish bloclzade measures in thefullest degree compatible with technical neutralitj- might behoped for from Norwegian private interests, if not from theGovernment, provided, only that the average Norwegian werepersuaded that his country could and would be protected b3&quot;Great Britian, if necessary by force, agaist possible Germanreprisals.3 Secretary,: Committee of Imperial Defence.
3, Until a few months ago, however,  the averageNorwegian was by no means persuaded of this - indeed,Sir Cecil Dormer recently reported that there was a widespread belief to the contrary, which was having aserious effect on the general Norwegian attitude towards this country;    and, though more recent developments mayhave somewhat shaken this belief, it seems clear thatit still has considerable influence on the Norwegianattitude.4. Both Sir Cecil Dormer and Mr.Freese-Pennefather(who has acted as Charge d&apos;Affaires in his absence) havedone their best, in private conversation with anyNorwegian with, whom they have been able to discuss thesubject,  to make them realise that, for obviousstrategic reasons arising from Norway1s geographical position,  this country - v/ill always be obliged to regardan attack on Norway as an attack on herself.      They havenot. however, been authorised to state definitely thatthis is more than their own personal view (except asregards the possibility of a German attempt to seize the Stavanger aerodrome, on which specificpoint Mr. Freese-Pennefather was recently authorisedto tell the head of the Norwegian Air Force that &quot;ifGerman forces were to seize the aerodrome, british forces would of course attempt to dislodge them andwould expect Norwegian assistance in this&quot;);    and itseems probable that if they could make it plain in theright quarters that this was the definite view ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government also,, the effect would be considerable and far-reaching.
i* -hardly be emphasised that this wouldxtacsfc. Jb&amp; equivalent to giving Norway a public guaranteeof the kind given to Poland or Roumania.     TheNorwegian Government, indeed, do not want such aguarantee;   but at the same time, in Sir Cecil Dormer-sopinion, the individual members of that Governmentwould be by no means averse from learning privatelyfrom him that what he has said to them on hia ownauthority does, in fact, represent the policy of hisGovernment.6. Lord Halifax will accordingly be glad to learnas soon as possible what view the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee would take of the commitments involvedin the issue of instructions to His Lajesty*sMinister at Oslo to speak to the Norwegian authoritieson these lines., intimating-confidentially but, formallythat His Lajesty&apos;s Government would regard a Germanatfcaelcjon. Norway--as^tantamount to an attack on thiscountry.I am, etc. ,(Signed)    D.W. LASCELLES.-
