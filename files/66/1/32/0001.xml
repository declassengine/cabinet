jHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT       265TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.7fSECRET. COPY NO.-_&apos;D.O.B.  (391.33.WAR    CABINET.CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE.STAFF CONVERSATIONS WITH-BFIj(^TTM.REPORT.1. We have been asked to prepare a short paper showingthe reasons that make it necessary to have staff conversations with the Belgians if any attempt to savetheir territory is to be made by Great Britain and France.The assumption is that the paper will be for the use of a delegate who is to go to Brussels and what-follows hasbeen written with this in view.2. The whole question of assistance to Belgium hasbeen thoroughly discussed between the French and BritishStaffs.      If Belgium is attacked, it is obvious that shecannot stand up to Germany alone, and that if any partof Belgian territory is to be saved it can only be done with the assistance of French and British troops onBelgian soil.3. The French have very definite ideas on the variouslines that might be held for the defence of Belgium.Both the French and British staffs however are agreed that nothing effective can be done without previous collaboration with the Belgians.      The reasons for this are as follows

(a) Without previous staff talks no plan can he madefor,the movement forward of British and french troops into Belgian territory.      It would he amilitary mistake to undertake an improvised move forward in face of German attack.     Converselythe more fully movement plans can he worked outthe further eastward will it he possible to concentrate French and British troops and thegreater the area of Belgium that may be saved.(b) Without staff talks no proper preparation force  -ordination of defensive positions is possible.We could not tak0 British troops from preparedpositions in France and commit them to Belgium,even to the western part of the country unlessdefensive positions had been thoroughly preparedbeforehand.(c) Although French and British bombers could bedirected against the German columns and communications without previous collaboration with the Belgians, 1 their intervention would be far more effective if their plan of action hadbeen agreed in advance, and if the Belgian andFranco-Briti: h communications had been linked upso as to provide early information of the besttargets.      In particular an exact knowledge ofthe Belgian demolition points, and of the linesof advance which they are most anxious to closemust be fully disclosed to the French and british air Staffs in advance.k. The general line, therefore to be taken with the belgians is that without&apos;previous staff talks the mostwe can do to help is to take some air action againstadvancing German troops.     With staff.talks completed,and provided that there; is still time to make plans formpvement of troops and prepare positions on which west and we can assist with French and British forces onBelgian territory.      Once the agreement of the BelgianGovernment has been secured, we shall be prepared atonce to discuss with the Belgians our proposed plans.Until then for reasons of secrecy it would be dangerous to sajr more.The detailed arrangements would best be carriedi -out so fa:.1 as we are concerned by G.H, Q. ,B.E.F., and No, 1Air Mission.

5. Finally, we consider that it would he most advantageous if we could meet the delegate who is to goto Brussels before he starts.     A personal explanationwith the help of maps would place him in a much better position to put the case for staff conversations thanthe persual of a note which at best can only furnish a background to the subject,,(Signed) G.L.N. NEWALL.&quot;       DUDLEY POUND.&quot;       EDMUND IRONSIDE.Central War Room,16th September, 1939.
