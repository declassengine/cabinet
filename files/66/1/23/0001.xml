.   THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT- &quot;    . &apos;     *&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;  -&quot;TO  BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.gE 0 R E T. - COPY NO.H.Q.S..  (59)   23Q WAR CABINET.CHIEFS OP STAPP COMMITTEE.GERMAN OBSERVANCE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.Report.In accordance with Conclusion 4 (a) of the 10thMeeting of the War Cabinet, held on 10th September, 1939,we have investigated the position up to date as regardsthe German observance or otherwise of the InternationalLav/ relating to war at sea, on land and in the air.The following paragraphs give the position sofar as it can be ascertained from the evidence whichis available, at present.At seaa2. From information hitherto received the ATHENIAsinking appears to be the only one in which it is safe tosay that the ship was torpedoed without warning.      in several other cases it would appear that the safety of the orcw&apos; was not fully ensured, i.e. they were left in open boatsa long way from land, but further than that it is notpossible to go until more information is available.On land.3. There are no substantiated reports that the Germans-have contravened International Law on land, other than theirinitial act of advancing their armed forces across theirfrontiers without a declaration of war.     A report was received that mustard gas was dropped from the air.     There has,however, been no confirmation of this and the British mission in Poland do not think it probable.

In the Air.4.o There is no code of rules of air warfare which has&quot;been formally accepted &quot;by international agreement.     In theabsence of such a code the actions of air forces must,basically? be regarded as conditioned by the generally accepted principles governing the conduct of war.      Inaddition, a considerable measure of practical guidance isafforded by the Draft Hague Rules of Air Warfare drawn up in1923.    These Rules have not been formally adopted by any government and have therefore not acquired the force ofinternational law;    moreover,  they are open to criticismin certain respects.     Extracts from these Rules are attached as Appendix I.5o From the reports received, the targets attacked by the German Air Force in Poland may be classified asfollows(i)    Military forces,(ii)    Military works and depots,  including aerodromes,(iii)    Aircraft factories,(iv)    Ammunition factories,(v)    Lines of communication generally,  includingroads, railways and railway stations, bridges,trains on the move (one of these was a civilian train and many casualties were caused)(vi)    Certain towns and villages &quot;in the immediateneighbourhood of the operations of land forces&quot;which may, in some cases be included in (v)eAttached, as Appendix II, is a table in which aresummarized reports dealing with cases in each category inwhich civilians have been killed and including the only wellauthenticated case of attack upon a target falling outsidethe Rules quoted in Appendix I.

6. Casualties to the civil population have &quot;been .caused in the main by inaccurate bombing of targets regardedas legitimate, according to paragraphs 1 and 8 of theDraft Hague Rules,,   or deliberately,under paragraph 4,where -air bombardment has been carried out on small towns and villages in the vicinity of the land battle.    There arepossibly more than one exception to this general statementbut it would appear, on the evidence available, that the deliberate bombardment of the civilian population as suchhas not been pursued as a policy.general Conclusion.7.o The conclusion drawn from the foregoing is that,apart from the sinking of the Athenia, without warning,and apart from their attacic on Poland, without a declarationof war, we are not warrented in saying that the german armed Forces have not observed the rules of InternationalLaw at sea and on landoAs regards air warfare, and taking as a basis thegenerally accepted principles governing the conduct of warand the rules which His Majesty1 s-GoveMiment would proposeto follow themselves, it is not, on the evidence at present available, possible to say more than that it does not appearthat the German Air Forces have so far adopted a policy ofdisregard of these principles and rules.(Signed)    C.L.N.- 1IE./ALL,DUDLEY POUND,-E*  IRONSIDE;Central War Room,.12th September, I939a

Extracts from Article 24 of the.....DraftiHague Rules* of,Air Warfare,: 192501.     Aerial bombardment Is legitimate only when directed at a military objective, that is to say, an objectof which the destruction or injury would constitute a distinct military advantage to thebelligerents2&apos;,      Such bomba.rd.ment is legitimate only when directedexclusively at the following objectives;    militaryforces;    military works, military establishmentsor depots;    factories constituting important and well-known centres engaged in the manufacture ofarms, ammunition or distinctively military supplies;lines of communication or transportation used formilitary purposes,,35 3  3  3 4o      In the immediate neighbourhood of the operations ofland forces the bombardment of cities, towns,villages, dwellings or buildings is legitimate,provided that there exists a reasonable presumption that the military concentration is sufficientlyimportant to justify such bombardment, havingregard to the danger thus caused to the civilpopulation^
