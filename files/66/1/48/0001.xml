The War Cabinet had under consideration theSecond Report of the Land Forces Committee  (War cabinet paper w.p ,   (39) 37), and a Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer thereon,      (War Cabinet Paper W.P0   (59) 42)THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE referred to paragraph 9 of the Annex to War Cabinet Paper W.P.   (39) 42*in which it was suggested that civilian demands on the difficult foreign currencies might be kept down to  250millions a year in war, and that, if we could maintain asubstantial proportion  of our exports to those countries,we might be able to face these demands without a draft onour reserves.      He said that this would only be possible if a sufficient proportion of the available man-power andraw materials were allotted to our export industries.      Inview of the very large demands of the Services, he thoughtsuch an assumption was optimistic.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that those&apos; particulartypes of export which would produce the foreign exchangerequired, might be stimulated.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that we might have to subsidise certain export industries, but theeffect of this would depend on conditions in the foreigncountries importing the goods.      The export trade to theUnited States was mainly a luxury one.      If the UnitedStates prospered and did not denounce the trade agreement,it was possible that we could keep our export trade with her at a high level0THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY stressed the need for anearly decision on this matter.      Supply for twenty divisionswithin the next twelve months could be arranged fromproductive resources in this country,      Supply for the55 Division programme, however, meant calling on the UnitedStates for machine tools and raw materials, and the limiting factor both to the extent of, and to the time in which, the

programme could be carried out, depended on our-dollar resources^     Machine tool purchases from abroad wouldhave- to be made even for a programme of thirty twodivisionsoTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the big issue was whether we could afford to make a land effortsmaller than that proposed by the Committee.     His own view, which he had formed with reluctance, was that wecould aim at nothing smaller than the force proposed byhis Committee, even if it entailed the exhaustion of our dollar resources within two years.     Viscount G-ort had said that the war might he lost in France, even if itcould not he won there, and we could not afford to take this risk.     He ventured to suggest that the treasury should not treat the dollar position too rigidly, andassume that no dollar spent could ever he replaced0     Hewould have thought that there were ways and means oftackling the exchange position.      The Germans and theItalians Ibiad done so and were not yet bankrupt.     We in turn would be forced to adopt the same devices of restriction of imports, the severest control&apos; of exchange and the stimulation of exports.     We might indeed heforced to adopt expedients which,.we hardly dared to mention now, in order to carry the war through to a successful conclusion.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL service said that the total estimated labour requirement for thewhole armament programmes (including the programme forfifty five divisions) was 5,500,000 persons. -   this figure needed examination, but was the only one at present available,.      Output would be greatly impeded if there werenot adequate protection against air attack, and suchprotection must be given first priority if the labourestimates were to be valid*      The total personnel at

present employed in the industries concerned was ahout2,700,000 including 300,000 women.      Of this total, atleast 1,000,000 would have to he reserved for other purposes, such as air raid precautions work, civil tradeand so forth.    There was thus a deficit of 3,800,000to he filled.      Of these about 1,300,000 could be women,as compared with about 700,000 women dilutees in thelast war.      He estimated that making allowances forother purposes, the pool out of which these 3,800,000persons would have to be found,  included about 5,000,000persons (3,500,000 men and 1,500,000 women) at presentin industrial employment, and a large number of women in private domestic employment or without occupation.His conclusion therefore, was that we should not regard the labour proposals of the suggested programme asinsuperable, provided that:-(i)    no new labour demands were added.(ii)    sufficient time for development was allowed, that is to say, at leasteighteen months to two years beforepeak production was expected.(iii)    production was not materially impededby air attack.Continuing,  the Minister of Labour and national Service referred to the factory construction programme.      The building labour requirements, as estimated even for thirty-two divisions, would exhaustpractically the whole number of carpenters and brick-layers in the building trades.      Moreover, the time that could be allowed for development was much shorter sincethe construction of the necessary buildings was thefirst step in the programme.      On his present

information, therefore, he was not able - to say that thenecessary labour could be obtained, and the position should be re-examined, both as regains the items in theprogramme and the methods and dates of construction.It was for this reason that he had asked for a statisticalexamination of the labour programme.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY supported theproposal for a statistical examination.      As regards thelabour force available, he said that, of the 14-jy millionmales in 1918, 5-g- million had joined the armed forces and 5-g- million had been employed on civil work.      Theremaining 3^ million, together with 1^ million females,had maintained a force of 100 divisions.      The number ofmales between the ages of 15 to 65 had,now risen to17 millions, an increase of 2^ millions on the 1918 figure.The smaller army proposed should require 1-g- million menless than before.     He estimated.that there should be4 million more males available than in 1918, and that thelabour problem should be therefore Buocoptlble ofsolution0Continuing, The First Lord of the Admiraltynoted from the Memorandum of the Chancellor of theExchequer, that we were already spending as much as in1918, although the war effort was as yet nothing likeso great.      He asked why we apparently had so little toshow for this expenditure.It was pointed out, that not only had we nowto pay for the Air Defence of Great Britain and for civil Defence, but that modern equipment was far more costly and complicated, while our modern air1 forcecalled for an enormous industrial effort.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR pointed outthat the figure for present expenditure could not fairly be compared with the figure for expenditure In 1918.

The  210 millions a month which we were spending at-present, included a Par higher1 proportion of expenditure for social services, which in turn resulted in the cir-speculation of money within the country,      In order toobtain a fair comparison,  the amount spent on social services should be subtracted from both figures, whichwould leave the expenditure on armaments on a comparablebasis.      For these reasons, he did not think that wecould say that for war purposes we had already reachedthe level of our supreme effort in 1918.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that according to the Treasury Memorandum, the cost of a soldier now, was 2-3 times as great as in 1918, althoughthe price level was only half.      In other words, a soldier today.cost 5-6 times as much as in 1918.      Hewondered whether this was in fact the case.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that,  inhis Memorandum, he was not trying to make out a easeagainst the proposals of the Committee;    he was merely&apos;endeavouring to set out impartially, the financialposition as it appeared to his advisers.      If we lost the war, it would be of little use to boast that we hadconserved our financial resources.      But;,  on the otherhand,  if we did not expend our resources in the best way we might regret it later.      It was&quot; true,  as theSecretary of State for War had said, that social servicebulked more largely in our present expenditure, and thatin 1918 a greater proportion was spent on armaments.The relevant fact, however, was that this prodigiousexpenditure, however incurred, was going on now at thebeginning of a war.      In his view the dollar position was likely to cause more anxiety than the budgetary

positions which could, he improved by various expedientsContinuing, The Chancellor of the Exchequerinvited his colleagues to look at the gold reservefigures in the lower half of the second page of hisMemorandumo    The Chancellor proceeded to give thefigures of our gold reserves 18 months ago and at thepresent time, and in 1914, expressed in weight of gold.(These figures are recorded in the SecretaryfsStandard Pile of War Cabinet Conclusions).      He addedthat in 1914 we had a larger available stock inmobilisable foreign securities.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said he understood that the total of our foreign securitieswas estimated at  250 millions.      In 1937 our net income from such securities had been  220 millions, andhe thought that the capital value of our foreign securities must be far in excess of  250 millions.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that most of our foreign investments were in sterling.    Theinvestments that mattered and which were dealt with inhis Memorandum, were dollar securities.      It might bepossible to increase our resources by selling sterlingforeign securities for dollars, but he was advised that the amount which was likely to be realised Inthis way was small.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE suggestedthat it might be possible to sell, not the sterlingsecurities, but the assets themselves.      For instance,instead of selling Argentine Railways Securities we might dispose of the Railway itself.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER agreed.      Hethen referred to the table given in paragraph 17 ofthe annex to his Memorandum,.      He could not of course

claim that the figures quoted there, were anything hutan estimate, hut he believed they were reasonable.The conclusion which seemed to follow from thesefigures was given in paragraph 19, where it was statedthat if we put   tho full programme recommended by theLand Forces Committee into execution, our dollar resources might be exhausted by the end of the second year of the war.      He did not wish to oppose adecision to expand our forces;    but his colleaguesought to be aware of, and give due weight to, thefinancial implications.      The Minister of Labour and national Service would also have serious problems to face as a result of these proposals.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICEagreed.      He emphasized particularly that no public statement regarding dilution should be made by theGovernment.     At that very moment, most delicatenegotiations about the employment of women were beingcarried on between employers and employees.&quot;     It was essential that dilution problems should be left forsolution by the interests directly concerned.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER referred to paragraph 4 of the annex to his Memorandum.      He agreedthat the distribution of our expenditure was different from what it had been in 1918, but this paragraphshowed that we were dealing with critical figures.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR pointed outthat the present expenditure of  210 millions per month included heavy capital expenditure on theerection of factories,  the accumulation of stocks andon air raid precautions.      The national income, quotedas  4,750 millions, would rise with this expenditure,which would pro tanto reduce the percentage of thenational income spent by the Government.

THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER agreed thatthe national income would expand, hut suggested that expenditure would also increase,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought that by building up our industrial resources in this country,we might avoid some proportion of dollar purchases;THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that thedesire for dollars was spreading^     For instance,Roumania had recently demanded payment in dollars for wheat iTHE .LORD PRIVY SEAL asked what help had been offered by Canada^,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that canada had made a most generous financial offer and he hoped that they would provide funds for the extension of factories in that Dominion.      The greatest hope offurther Air Force expansion lay in Canada.THE SECRETARY Ok-  oT^xil jpujx jjuMjlwxuim jhjj r/ixxtosaid that Canada had promised financial help up to thelimit of her capacity.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that a few words from him might possibly help his colleagues in reaching a decision on this problem.      The Land Forces Committeehad recommended a certain programme as our objective.When he had first seen the proposals for the Army andthe Air Force he had thought it quite impossible to find the necessary labour and materials.      Although manydetails still remained to be worked out, he noted thatthe Ministers concerned reported it as feasible to carry through these programmes as regards labour and materials.He felt that this made a great difference.      On thefinancial side, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as was his duty, had laid before them a Memorandum which brought

out the dangerous aspects of the financial situation.He thought that these dangers should he kept continuallyin mind.      We were, however, planning for a long war,and in three years the position might well undergo markedchanges.      For instance, we did not know what attitudethe United States would adopt.      In three years time this attitude might have changed and might go far to ease the dollar situation.      For such reasons he feltthat, whilst the financial dangers had been plotted andmust he constantly watched, they were not necessarilysuch as to necessitate the rejection of these proposals.It was certain that ?/e must plan now for expansion,  and by planning, he meant not only thepreparation of the necessary schemes, but also thesiteing, erection and equipment of factories and theprovision of materials and labour.      Unless we plannednow, our schemes would not come&apos; to fruition In&apos; time.This would cost a certain amount of money and effort,but would not commit us to carrying out the programme toits full extent at any particular time, or indeed at all.On the other hand, unless the plans were initiated now,it might prove to be too late.      He had,  therefore,reached the general conclusion that the recommendationsof the Committee, as set out on page 2 of their Report,should be accepted, and in particular those recommenda-tions regarding the financial examination and statisticalinvestigation of the programmes.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY inferred that a decision-on these lines would carry with it Treasury Approval forthe bigger programme of fifty-five divisions.      Thiswould mean large increases in factory potential,necessitating the purchase of a minimum amount of machine tools and raw materials in the United States.

THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER agreed butemphasized that details of proposed expenditure must bereferred as usual to the Treasury.      He thought that although they were accepting the proposal to go forward on the full programme, his colleagues would wish to watch its development.      He also suggested that,  inorder to keep his colleagues informed of the position,he should report monthly to the War Cabinet on theforeign exchange position.THE MINISTER OP HOME SECURITY was anxious lest the new programmes should interfere with the supply ofCiIZ3&amp;&apos; shelters.THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY said that, unless anew demand for steel shelters arose,  the position wassecure, and agreed to consult with the Minister ofHome Security regarding the matter.      ,      . ./UivU^fr.  3^ ^Ls.(w.c^-^ec**A.S*y   Soviet   tUm&quot; ^  w**    &apos;aM* C&amp;^&amp;*.i*.t .I   The War Cabinet agreed:(a) To authorise the Minister of Supply to initiate the necessary plans (includingthe erection and equipment of factories and the provision of materials) for thesupply, on the full British Army Scalewithin a period of two years, of fifty-five divisions,  it being understood thatthere would be. the usual consultationwith the Treasury on the various stages of the plans:(b) That the supply programmes for the Army -on the scale in (a) above, of the RoyalAir Force for an output of 2,550 aircraftper month, and of the Royal Navy and.
