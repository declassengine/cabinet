(39) 9th Conclusions, Minute 14),the Chief of the Air Staff said that according to first-hand information51 from Poland the Germans had deliveredair attacks on Polish industry including, in particular,the aircraft industry and also on objectives such aspower installations.-    He suggested that it would benecessary to consider the effect of this action on ourown policy and the War Cabinet took note that a reporton this matter would be submitted by the Chiefs of staff committee. -3o-        This report is rendered in pursuance of the aboveconclusion.-     Its object is to consider whether in view of developments since the outbreak of war, including events in poland, there should be any change in the existing policy for the employment of our main air striking force.3e-        Before examining in detail the factors affectingthe jmmedi&amp;te problem, it seems desirable that we should^More recent information shows there is some doubt about this.;   See paragraphs ll and 13 below..RET. &apos;,J59) 20.-

attempt to paint in the background.      We,  therefore,quote below the more important passages from variousreports which were drawn up after an exhaustive study -a study moreover which was undertaken at a time whenjudgment was not influenced by local events or thestream of current opinion.4. As regards the general policy for the Alliedconduct of the War, the following passage is quotedfrom the Report on the First Stage of the Anglo-FrenchStaff Conversations.&quot;8. The time factor will have considerablebearing on all these factors.      It seems clearthat it will work in favour of the Allies, whowill be able to count on an increasing Britishstrength, and possibly the assistance of american industry.,      On the other hand, time is against Germany and Italy, whose reserve stockswill in due course &quot;become exhausted, and whowill then be faced with serious difficulties ofsupply, which should affect the morale both ofthe armed forces and of the civil population.9. Anglo-French strategy should thereforebe adapted to a long war,  implying:-(i) A defensive strategy at the outset,at least on the Continent, whileexecuting the greatest measureof economic pressure.(ii) The building up of our military strength to a point at which wecan adopt an offensive strategy.&quot;This policy was approved by the Committee of ImperialDefence and agreed with General Gamelin.5. The next document to which we would inviteattention is a report which the Chiefs of Staffsubmitted to the Committee of ImperialDefence on the&apos; 28th July,  1939,  (C. I.D.  Paper

No. D.P.  (P) 65) on the subject of the assistance which we could, afford to Poland,the following passages:-&quot;x        k        xIf Geraany holds in the West and attacks inthe East, there is little that we ourselvescan do either at sea or on land at the outset of the war to relieve the pressure on Poland,and therefore that the problem resolves itselfinto a question of what we can do in the air.As to this, we realise that it would be impossiblfor His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide, inadvance of the event, the precise manner inwhich our air forces should be employed,As a general point, we would emphasise that the fate, of Poland will depend upon the ultimateoutcome of the war, and that this, in turn,will depend, upon our ability to bring aboutthe eventual defeat of Germany,  and not onour -ability to relieve pressure on Polandat the outset.      This must therefore be the over-riding consideration which governs ourchoice of action.&quot;s s k x -6. On the 31st August last, a Report was submittedto the War Cabinet &quot;on the subject of the action whichshould be taken by our main air striking force at the outset of hostilities.      The recommendations were summarised as&apos; follows:-(a) If Germany initiates unrestricted air action from the outset:-We should attack objectives vital to Germany&apos;s war effort, and inparticular her oil resources.(b) If Germans confines, her ^attacks .tq purelymi 1 itary ob jec*tives : -(i)    We should, launch an attack on theGentian Fleet at Wilhelmshavenunless we have certain information that it is not there.s Note:    Paper Ho. CCS.968 subsequently.withdrawn in the interest of secrecy

(ii)   We should attack warships at seawhen found within rangee(iii)   We should undertake the widespreaddropping of propaganda at night.(iv)   We should conserve our resources untilour hands. are freed, by relaxation of policy, to adopt the more vigorousaction contemplated in (a) aboveo7. The War Cabinet on the 3rd September, gavegeneral approval to the above recommendations(WoMo(39) 1st Conclusions) and the action of our air striking force has proceeded on the lines setout in paragraph 6(b) above08* The broad question which now requires decision is this:-In the light of the events of the past ten days -Should we adhere to the policydecided on before the war and laiddown in the bombardment instructions,ioSo, to confine our action topurely military objectives in the narrowest sense.of the word;    orirrespective of&quot;what Germany has done or may do in the immediate future,should we, in the intexoests of theultimate defeat of Germany, departfrom that policy and initiateextended air action against objectives beyond the limits of the bombardment instructions,  and even ofa strict interpretation of the draftHague Ruleso(a)

9.        We think it important that the WarCabinet should be fully aware of the implications of the second alternative set out above10.       We wish first to record our conviction that if we adopt the second course (8(b) above)we should do so in full and without any restrictions - other than those that we shallalways observe, such as refraining from attackon civil population as such for the purpose ofdemoralisatione11.       It has been suggested that our policy should be always to keep one step behind theGermans in this respect0     Apart, however,from the fact that this means a surrender ofinitiative, it would definitely not be effectives,For instance this policy to-day would mean that,since the Germans have attacked the Polishaircraft industry, we should be free only to do thesame to themD    The German aircraft industry however is

far largera more dispersed and more difficult to attackthan that of the Poles, or even our own.   And to initiatethis form of action alone could not have decisiveresults, and would involve all the disadvantages of moreextended action - such as against power supplies in the ruhr - with few, if any, of the advantageSo12*       If therefore we extend air action at all we shouldhe permitted to implement what v/e believe to be our most effective air plans - which involve the attack of power supplies6 oil resources and war industry ingeneral - unhampered by the consideration that they -will inevitably involve incidental loss of life to civilians.13.        In this connection we must also point out thatwe have undertaken to President Roosevelt to confineourselves to &quot;strictly military&quot; objectives &quot;upon theunderstanding that these same rules will be scrupulouslyobserved by all our opponents.&quot;    Both Hitler and Goeringhave publicly affirmed their intention so to restrict the operations of the German Air Force.    And we haveno definite or reliable proof that in fact they havenot done so in Poland - though possibly on a somewhatelastic interpretation - or that they have embarked ona deliberate policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.Considerations affecting the Problem..14.       We now turn to an examination of the considerations which, have a bearing on the question of whether our air policy should5or should not be altered, in the light orthe present situation and prospective develop-meaats.

Poland.15.       A large portion of Poland has been rapidlyoverrun.     This was always expected.     The Germans havevirtually wiped out the Polish air force and thePolish aircraft industry and they need not maintainany material proportion of their total air force on theirEastern Front.Consequently nothing that we can do in the air in the western theatre would have any effect ofrelieving pressure on Poland..France.16.       France, contrary to expectation, has not yetbeen subjected to air attack:    her own air forces havenot been engaged.      The French Army are shortly to stagea large-scale operation against the Siegfried Line.It must not be assumed that this will have immediateor spectacular success.  .  But the whole French Army is involved:    it will at least contain large forces -already some nine extra German divisions have been drawn in by the perliminary advance - and may well draw offsubstantial strength from the- eastern front.      It isnot impossible that it may develop further into a combined allied effort of major importance, mainly by theFrench Army supported by British air forces.17.       We have already promised General Game1in thesupport of British bombers, for which the operationsmay provide important objectives within the limits of

1  0I u rJour present bombardment policy.      If the unexpectedoccurs and the offensive shows real signs of achievingdecisive results, it is important that we should be ina position to exploit it to the full by the use of our air striking force.18. Consequently, from this point of view there is little to be gained by embarking on independent air operations which might result In reducing our capacity to support the French offensive effectively should itachieve unexpected success.Great Britain,19. We have shown in the preceding paragraphs that,from the point of view both of relieving pressure on poland, and of the possibility of a decisive break throughin the west, it would be unwise to commit our main air striking force to operations outside the scope of ourpresent bombardment policy.    There remains the question of whether it would be in our own military interest to embark on such operations.      The factors affecting this problem are set out in the paragraphs that follow:-20. First there is the fact that, entirely contrary toexpectation, the German air force is taking no actionwhatever against this country, even as a rejoinder to the limited action that we have taken against Germany.      It ispossible that this state of affairs may last for some time if we ourselves do nothing to disturb it;    it may be taken as quite certain on the other hand, that if we go beyond thelimits of our present bombardment policy, it will come toan end, and this country will be subjected to air attack.

21.       Secondly, time is on our side.     Hitler wants ashort war, which he can only hope to win either by a large-scale land and air offensive against France, or byunrestricted and intensive air and submarine attack against this country and our seaborne trade.As regards the former, we do not consider thathe can transfer land forces in sufficient strength to thewest in time to stage a large-scale land offensive with any hope of decisive success this year.     Therefore, althoughit is doubtful whether the Germans believe that indiscri-terminate air attack against this country would bring rapidsuccess, initiation of extended air action on our part would give them the excuse and the incentive to gambleon it, combined with unrestricted air and submarine attackon merchant shipping.22.       Thirdly, our programme of air defence both of thiscountry and of our seaborne trade, is far from complete.Numerically, the combined strength of the British and French air forces is very inferior to the Germans - though thereis reason-to believe that, at least in respect of our ownair force, this weakness is to some extent offset bysuperior quality.     We are very dangerously   short of reserves in the Air Force;    and our A.A. equipments, bothon land and. at sea are at present far short of requirements.In particular we fell some anxiety about our fighter position.       We have only about 30% reserve of modern fighters, and will be mainly dependent on production

to replace wastage0     Successful attack on five mainaircraft factories would at least seriously crippleour production of fighters and gravely prejudice our production of aircraft in general.It follows therefore that we hove much to gain by not deliberately putting an end to the present state of affairs in which, on the one hand, we arenot suffering appreciable loss and, onthe other, arebuilding up our reserves and developing our potentialalmost entirely unhampered by enemy air action.It is true that this also applies in the main to theenemy, but we have rel^tivelv, much more to gain inthis respect than the Germans.Even a few weeks will mean an appreciableimprovement.     If - as seems very unlikely - theenemy were to abstain from large scale operations against this country over the winter, it would make all the difference to our capacity to carry outsustained air operations in the spring, and at theessifc&apos; time protect this country and our seaborne trade.

23o       The arguments in paragraphs 21-23 ahove suggest thata delay in the initiation of the air war would he toour advantage: and there are others which could &quot;be putforward on this side of the case.     On the other hand there are substantial military arguments in favour of theextension of the scope of air action at an early date.Among those is the fact that at the moment thereare still considerable air forces on the Eastern front;the need to bring home to the German people, withoutfurther delay, but methods other than propaganda, whatthey are likely to suffer in a cause that is not theirown;    the heartening moral effect upon them which islikely to result from a conquest of Poland before they themselves have experienced any of the horrors of war;and the fact that, since the German resources inmaterial are limited while we have behind us theresources of the Empire and ultimately of the world,it would be in our interest to begin as soon as possibleto reduce the resources of German war industry.For convenience of reference, the militaryarguments for and against an early initiation of intensive air warfare are set out in tabular form inAppendix A.      These together with those which have beendiscussed at greater length in the preceding paragraphsmay be summarised as follows:-

(a) Nothing has happened to alter ourfrequently expressed conviction that time is on our side.(h) If we modify our existing policy at all we must &quot;he free to adoptour most effective planssregardless of incidental lossof life to civilians.(c) An extension of air action can do nothing to help Poland.(d) As far1 as the French land operations are concerned there is nothing tohe gained from committing our airstringing force to action beyond thelimits   of our present banbardnient policjs(e) As far as concerns the defence ofthis country and our- seaborne trade  delay in the inception of theair war would be to our advantage.(f) We cannot assert with any confidence that the early initiation by us ofunrestricted air action would materially improve our chances of winning a short war.(g) The retention of our air striking-force relatively intact9 and with increased reservess will go a longway to ensure that the Germans fortheir part cannot win a short war,should they attempt to do so bythese means before it is too late.(h) The arguments in favour of ah earlyinitiatioh&apos;&quot;of extended air action.&quot;are summarised in paragraph83 and set out in detail in the left hand column of the Appendix.above. our   conclusions, on purely military grounds, in the light of the situation as it nowappearsj,are as followsCONCLUSIONS.24sAfter weighing all the considerations set out

On balance it is our considered opinion -that,at present, the military disadvantages of.initiating extended air action definitelyoutweigh the possible advantages.We should therefore adhere for the present toour existing policy as laid down in the bombardment Instructions;,We should be prepared to exploit, as far aspossible, the situation arising from theFrench offensive and to support it as effectively as conditions wall permit -consistent with not dissipating our bomberforces by their employment on ineffectiveand uneconomical &quot;casks.(Signed)    C.L.N&quot;.

For.(i) TheGerman hates being hurtin his own country.    We have brought home to him by che nightflights that we can reach him;if we continue to refrain fromhitting him the effect may wearoff*    It may well be that activeopposition to the Nazi regime ismore likely to he stimulatedthan otherwise by bringing home to the population, particularly to the rhineland and Ruhr - whatthey are likely to suffer in a cause which is not their own.The bombing of Rhineland townsin the spring of 1918 immediatelyled to a clamour by the Germansfor a limitation of bombing tothe battlefield.Against.(a) On the other hand it maybe that dislike of the nazi regime and antipathy to war on the part of a largeproportion of the enemypopulation may bring about an internal collapse withouta major struggle in the west.Our present propaganda measures are designed to achieve thisend and we should give them areasonable chance to take effect before abandoning themand precipitating a bombing and counter-bombing war.(ii) tie should be attacking objec-tive-s of which the destructionwould have a real value in reducing Germany 1s capacity tocontinue war.    The RUHR is anagglomeration of war industry that has no counterpart inEngland or France.    .and ourrelative economic strengths are such that whereas we have behindus the resources of the Empireand even of the world, theenemy are virtually limited totheir already strained resources and those of the impoverishedcountries they have over-run.(iii) The complete defeat of POLAND-if achieved before any effective action by the Allies in the Westwould undoubtedly be exploitedby HITLER as a triumph of GERMANarms and would constitute apotent moral tonic for theGerman people.    As a resultsubsequent air action by theAllies would probably have lesseffect in stimulating dis-affection against the regimethan if it were taken now, and allied action as a whole willtake longer to bring about theultimate defeat of Germany.(b) In view of the inconi-plete state of our defencesour own war industry isstill very vulnerable -in particular our aircraft industry.    (See para,       above)London is a politicaland mercantile .centrewithout parallel, and theLocks in particular are an easy objective of vitalimportance.(c) Unrestricted air actionon our part could do little,or nothing to ameliorate theposition of Poland.And the pro-jected French operations with3ritish air support - while they may not so directly affectthe German people as air action inside GEI-dvIANY - will certainly bring home to themthat the Allies mean business and that the defeat of POLANDdoes not mean the end of the war.Arguments for and against the early initiation ofunrestricted air operations.

iv) At the moment we have theinitiative and could initiateaction against enemy war industry which would directly affect the enemy people.    if;we refrain until Poland is over-run and the Germans are free to turn in full strength to theWest we may never he able toundertake those plans.. /  TheGermans have shown how effectivelyair action can support land opera-tions (though admittedly this was against a relatively negligibleair force).      In the event of an overwhelming land attack againstPrance we may well have to use thewhole of our Air Force to checkthat attack, i. e,, entirelydefensively and with relatively little effect on the Germanpeople^.(v) There are at present aconsiderable proportion of(d) It cannot be assertedwith any confidence -- inview of the relative airstrengths - that air action on these linescould be decisive, either the German f:defences in -would be eas:the defencesLghters and A.A.She East and itLer to penetratein &quot;the West under present conditions than if wedelay until they can bring the mall over to the Westo      Our own and the French fighters in theWest are considerably superior to the Germans in numbers andthere are already indications that they may be superior in quality.Owing to the sise and. shape of their country the germans have inevitably to dispersetheir defences more than we do.in its material resultsor in i-i t.&quot;e:ec&quot;on tncmorale of the Germanpeople.If we sustained heavy losses in this form ofaction, we might well find ourselves when the enemyturns to attack in the west,with ou?-&quot; air forces atleast so seriously depletedthat ohey could afford littleeffective support to theAllied Arm.is Sc(e) Thel-J       L    l  :-hi -yenemy airc on side rap-super i or in numbers to ourown plus the PEEhGIhIf it turns out to heour equal in quality,  andif their Fighter and A.A.defences are as effective as our information as totheir numbers appears tosuggest (there is alreadysome doubt on this),  then aperiod of sustained air operations beginning at anearly date ;-x:.-r- well resultafter a time in making ourrelative strength worse thanit is now, even to a point when our bomber force may,temporarily, be unable tocarry on sustained opera-tions at all-

&apos;vi)       Although it is possible (that as a result of intensiveair action against this   -country we may have to undergo a period of grave danger andsuffering, we have behind us a free and united nation and empire with vast resources of allkinds.      The Germans, on theother hand, are already to someextent an exhausted anddispirited nation who are by nomeans united behind the nazi regime.Ultimately, therefore, weare in a better position to fox^cea long war than they are.f) It would be un-wise to count too much on internal collapse inGERMANY&quot;, either fromdisaffection or fromshortage of resources.Our military policy must be based on theprospect of a long war,however much we maydoubt our enemies&apos;capacity to sustain itoWe cannot yet assess the value to germany of her understandnngwith RUSSIA.rii) By not hitting the GERMANpeople quickly we enable the regime to tighten its&apos; hold onthe forces of possibledisaffection, and to make un-hindered the necessary adjustments in nationalorganisation from a peace to awar footing.( cr\Action of this sort on. our part willirevit sbly i nvo1ve-irons diate retaliation. -We are less preparedthan Germany, andfurther breathing-spacewill be of great value,particularly for such measures as thefollowing:-A.R.P.  and civil defence generally.Adjustment of the warn-ing system to involvethe least possible inter-ference with normalactivity.Redistribution ofimports.Evacuation of non-essential GovernmentDepartments and the ad-minis trative machineryof important commercialfirms.Building up stocks offood, raw materials and oil supplies.Camouflage measures.NAVAL.Organisation of convoy0Arming merchant ships for defence, and asA tMiCSo
