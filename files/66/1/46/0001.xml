WEEKLY RESUME (NO. a) OP THE NAVAL, - MILITARY AND air situation PROM IS WOW. .3.4TH SEPTEMB35R TO 22&quot; NOON21ST&quot;SEPTEMBER,  1959.NAVAL SITUATION.British Dispositions.1, Our Naval dispositions are materially unaltered withthe following exceptions:-(a) The Anti--Submarine force&quot; in the Western Approacheshave been augmented.(b) A destroyer flotilla has been transferred from theMediterranean to Home Waters and replaced by one from China,(c) Two cruisers and an aircraft carrier have beentransferred from China to the East Indies Station.2. LOCH EWE has now been established as an emergency and alternative base to Scapa Plow, mainly as a precaution against air raids.3. The North Sea continuous Air patrol has now been extended to the Norwegian coast (between Montrose andObrestad),  thus enabling the submarine reconnaissance patrolto be discontinued.British Naval Losses,4. On 17th September, I1.M. Aircraft-carrier COURAGEOUSwas torpedoed and sunk in the Western Approaches.    Up to thepresent there are known to be 690 survivors of a crew of1,260.

ti OMining.5. The work of laying the Dover Barrage is nearlycomplete.6. The circumstances surrounding the sinking of theBelgian ALEX VAN OPSTAL off WEYMOUTH and damage to theBritish CITY OP PARIS off Aldeburgh, give rise to asuspicion that magnetic mines may have been laid.Submarine and anti-submarine activities.7. During the week ending midday September 20th,13 British Merchant Ships were sunk,  of a total tonnage of45,838 tons.    This compares with 17 ships totalling95,069 tons sunk during the ten days September 3rd to september 13th.8. The large majority of Merchant ships that have been sunk on the high seas have been more than 250 miles fromthe British Isles.    This goes to show that the U-Boats are working very far out, more or less in the areas to whichthey were forced at the end of the last war.9. Between noon on September 13th and noon onSeptember 20th,  some 45 attacks on enemy submarines were reported,  4 by aircraft.    U.39,  a 740 ton U-Boat,  attackedH.M. S. ARK ROYAL unsuccessfully was sunk by H. M. S..FOXHOUND on 13th September; 43 survivors were landed.U.27,  a 500 ton U-Boat, was sunk by H.M.S.  FORTUNE onSeptember 19th, and 38 survivors have been landed.    Anattack by H.M.S.   INTREPID and VESPER S.W.   of Milford on14th,  another by aircraft off Aberdeen, and a third also by aircraft E.  of Orkneys on 19th are considered as &quot;possibles&quot;.

British Shipping.10. Traffic through the Mediterranean and to and from italian and other Mediterranean ports has heen resumedsubject to convoy and routing,11. In addition to the East Coast convoys, which are running regularly, convoys from Halifax, Jamaica and sierra leone have been constituted.Outward-bound convoys from Liverpool and north foreland to the Western Approaches have been runningregularly all this week.    In the Mediterranean convoys are running East and West, escorted by both French and Britishwarships.IS. Nearly 400 ships have sailed in convoys since theyhave been in operation, and no ships have been sunk underthis system.German Naval Operations.13. There have been reports of German Naval Units in theNorth Sea in the neighbourhood of their declared mine-field.Otherwise their Fleet appears to be in its own home waters.14. It appears that the Germans are imposing something in the nature of a contraband control on neutral shipping,as two Finnish merchant ships bound for England are reportedto have been stopped by German warships off the norwegian coast and taken to Hamburg.15. The possibility of a descent by German reservistsfrom South America in armed German raiders, which causedalarm in the Falkland Islands some days ago, has now caused a warning to be sent to the South African Government thatthe descent may be made on Union territory,  (perhaps South

West Africa).    In connection with this it may be noted thatthe GENERAL ARTIGAS 11,254 tons, a particularly fast ship which was off the South American Coast on September 9th, was reported to be S.S.W. of St. Helena on September 18th.    Itmay also be noted that the WINDHUK 16,662 tons, which is asuspected ship, has been at Lobita Bay since Friday,September 15th.16. The OSTMARK continues to be active in the CANARIES.Italian Fleet.17. No change is reported of any importance.During the week Italian submarines had exercised inaccordance with the preliminary notification made, and in theareas set aside for that purpose by the recent Anglo-italian agreement.According to a report, apparently of French originemanating from Portugal the Italians are considering the saleof 50 of their submarines to Germany.Japanese Fleet.18. No change in this position is j?opox&apos;ted since lastweek.Soviet Fleet.19. Soviet naval activities are reported from the Gulf off inland.    These have been prompted ostensibly by the escapeof the Polish submarine ORZEL from Tallinn where she had takenrefuge and been interned by the Estonians.

MILITARY OPERATIONS.FRANCE.20. During the past week offensive action by the Frenchof an exploratory nature has been continued between theVOSCES and the MOSELLE.    German counter attacks have been repulsed.The Germans are reported to be building a new system of defences on the line STAMBACH - NUNSSCHEILER -GERSBACH - PIRMASENS - MUNSCHWEILER,GERMANY.General.21. German operations on the Western Front havebeen confined almost entirely to reconnaissance andlocal counter-attacks.    Reinforcements have been moved from north and central Germany to the areas threatened by the French attacks.    The Germans have withdrawn from certain regions in the SAAR and have left behind them a.series of effective &quot;booby traps&quot;.Work has been carried out steadily onfortifications, more especially those opposite the dutch and Belgian frontiers,  communications towards thesefrontiers and towards the SAAR being improved.    It isreported that there is a considerable concentration oftroops with tanks and anti-tank guns at LINNICH near theDutch frontier.Women and children are said to have been evacuated from AACHEN on the 16th September and also from FREIBURGand TULLINGEN (Lorrach area).Strength of Troops on the Western Front.22. As compared with the hth September when it was estimated that there .were 20 divisions on the Western Front

o sreports indicate that there are now ah out 2+2 divisions and possibly some independent tank units.    This difference of 22 divisions ia accounted for in the following manner:-(a) divisions, transferred from East to west   - k(b) divisions arrived from Central Germany     - 5(c) divisions newly identified -1322&quot;Movement of German Troops from East to West.23. No definite information has been received of thelocations of German armoured, light and motoriseddivisions which have been operating against Poland, - German-prisoners state that several of these formations have been moved from the Eastern to the Western Front,  though no confirmation of such moves has so far been received.2Ji. Certain infantr4t^rid--aj^tillery:-units belonging to five infantry divisions which have been operating on theIt I!Eastern Front were identified at OSNABRUCK and MTJNSTERon 15th and 16th September.    This report is stillunconfirmed but it may indicate that either the--whole or-........parts of thes-e-divisloxLS-^are.,being transferred to theWestern Front.25. Movements of troops westwards are reported, to havetaken place on the following railways:-KONSTANZ - BASLE - 12 - 13 - 15th September.MAGDEBURG - DRESDEN - Hl-th September.BRATISLAVA - VIENNA - 17th September,and also from MEMEL by sea.

German Casualties.26. It is not possible to give any estimate as to the;casualties suffered by the Germans to date.In the west they have undoubtedly been negligible,but in the east they have been reported as &quot;very severe&quot;.German Press reports have not contained any indicationas to the actual number of casualties, though they havegiven figures of . 01$ killed and .21$ wounded.POLAND.Operations.27. By the evening of the ll+th September the Polishattempt to stabilise the situation on the line of theRivers BUG and VISTULA had definitely failed;    in thenorth the army of the BUG was withdrawing south underheavy German pressure,  in the centre the Germans had crossed the VISTULA at at least two points, and in thesouth the Polish left flank was in danger of beingturned by the enemy armoured and mechanised forces operating towards LWOW (LEMBERG).    The POSNAN and   .BYDGOSZCZ armies were still isolated to the west of- WARSAW.    Attempts to form twelve reserve divisions east of the VISTULA had been unsuccessful in the face of continued and heavy. German air attacks.28. Owing to the general collapse,  the Polish high command decided to withdraw what forces they could tothe line of the Rivers DNIESTER and STRYJ in the extremesouth-east corner of the country, where they would stillcontrol the railv/ay to Rumania.    Garrisons were to beleft at WARSAW - BREST LITOVSK - LUBLIN and LWOW.

tmThe POSNAN and BYDGOSZCZ armies were ordered to fighttheir way through to WARSAW and help in the defence ofthe capital.    Polish General Headquarters was to withdraw to HORODENKA on the. Roumanian frontier.29. At this point there is little doubt that thePolish High Command had lost all control of their armies,a major contributory cause being the systematicdestruction of Polish communications by German air forces.The only chances of relief to the hard pressed Polisharmies were either that the German air forces could bedrawn off elsewhere or that very heavy rains might breakand so immobilise the enemy&apos;s mechanised formations;    andrain at this time of the year was not usual.30. Prom the morning of the 15th September theoperations of the various Polish groups were practicallyuncoordinated.    Heavy fighting took place round WARSAW,which is still holding cut, and the Poles inflictedheavy losses on a German armoured division east of thecapital.    The Poles also claim that the POSNAN andBYDGOSZCZ armies have broken through to WARSAW,  though this is denied by the Germans.In the centre the Poles are believed to haveretreated south-east in accordance with the general plan,but accurate information about this army group is stilllacking.In the south the Poles appear to have extricatedconsiderable forces and to have established garrisonson the DNIESTER and STRYJ.

They certainly had a considerable local success in this sector and claim to have taken 15,000 prisoners and destroyed, a whole armoured regiment,31. Any hopes that the Poles may have had ofreforming their forces in the south-east were shatteredby the Soviet invasion which began early on the 17thSeptember,.    Only some 100,000 frontier guards wereavailable to meet this threat and there was no seriousresistance^By the morning of the 20th September the SovietHigh Command claimed that their forces had penetrated toan average depth of 120 miD.es from the frontier and occupied VILNA, OLITA and BEREST0VTT8A (30 miles east ofBIALYSTOK)c    Cavalry and tank units had reached thesuburbs of LWGW.Reasons for Polish collapse.32, Apart from the numerical superiority of the germans and the subsequent Russian invasion,  the main causes ofthe Polish collapse appear to have been as follows :--(a) Oyerwhelmin^ Germantairsuperio?ityThe initial attacks on aerodromes,  flying schools and aircraft factor.Les crippled the   Polish AirForce.    Subsequent air attacks on the railwaysand on columns of troops reduced the mobility ofthe Polish ground forces most seriously andprecluded the development of an effective counter-offensive,.    Later, air attacks on the headquarters of the Polish armies and government -paralysedthe direction of the country1s military and civil

9 o nei 0 3activitiesc    These attacks were particularlyeffective,  as the Germans frequently succeeded in locating headquarters either through theirespionage system, or by directional wireless.Mechanised Forces.The Poles were surprised not only by the weightof attack but also by the depth to which german mechanised forces operated independently of their main forces.In the initial stages the operations of german armoured formations were an important factor in preventing the Poles stabilising the battle.Latterly, however,  the Poles seem to have achieved considerable successes againstisolated German armoured and motorised troops.Over-confidence.The Poles over-estimated their own and under-estimated the German strength.    They appear tohave assumed that the lack of roads wouldparalyse German motorised forces and give theadvantage in a war of movement to their ownhorsed cavalry.    Consequently,  they made fewdefensive preparations.    As one observer put ittfThe Polish Army of 1939 was admirably preparedfor the war of 1918K,Late withdrawal........of the Western Army,.The head of the British Military Missionconsiders that the retreat of the army from thePOSNAN Salient started two days too late.      Theabsence of these  eight divisions seriouslycompromised the effort to hold the BUG and theVISTULA.

SOVIET RUSSIA,33, An analysis of the dates of the various preparatorymeasures taken by the Red Army supports the view that the major decisions were taken after it became clear that anearly collapse of the Polish armies was at least highlyprobable.Reports indicate that the Soviet Government awaitedthe completion of the very considerable mobilisation whichthey were carrying out in the West before assuming action.The advance of the Red Army started early on 17thSeptember and was naturally rapid as there was littleresistance.There are signs that, in spite of the professionsof mutual good faith, the Soviet action was not entirelywelcome to the Germans,    and may even have been made to forestall them;   but, on the other hand,  there is some evidence to show that the Soviet was prepared to risk warwith Great Britain.BALTIC STATES.Latvia.3k. No further mobilisation is being carried out inLativa, for fear of protests from Soviet Russia.    troops have been moved to the frontier districts to controlrefugees from Poland, some five hundred of whom, togetherwith eighty three aeroplanes, are reported to havereached Latvia.Lithuania.35* The array has mobilised all classes of reservistsup to the age of 35, and has moved troops to the frontier.

It is announced that trtxs move is to deal with refugees and is not aimed against VILNA.    Lithuania is reportedto have rejected unofficial proposals to seize VILNAwith German aid hut it is possible that Russia may offerit to her.ITALY.Mainland.36. Two Alpini divisions and ten divisions of thethree corps normally stationed opposite the french frontier appear to have been moved westwards to theimmediate vicinity of the frontier.    Elements of three other divisions may have been moved westwards insupport.    There appears to have been no reinforcement of the Yugoslav frontier and other movements are confined to reinforcement of overseas garrisons, mainlyLibya.    Leave for the vine harvest and for grain sowingis to be granted, except to men in overseas garrisons.The rumoured formation of second-linedivisions to replace those sent overseas has not been confirmed and there is no reliable evidence of the reported intention to incorporate the black shirt Militiain the Army.There are still no military indications of.any immediate offensive intention on the part of Italy.    the concentration on the French frontier does not appear tohave proceeded, beyond defensive measures j    and, despite the continued reinforcement, measures in Libya appear tobe directed mainly against the possibility of an attack from Tunisia.

Albania.37. There seems to have been little military activity atthe ports of BRINDISI and DURAZZO, and no important rein-forcements are believed, to have arrived recently in Albania.There has been marked diminution of Italian activitynear the Greek frontier, where troops had been concentratedtov/ards the end of August ostensibly for manoeuvres.    forward troops are understood to have withdrawn 2 milometres from thefrontier and there are indications of a general movement oftroops from the Koritza and Argyrocastro areas to their normal peace stations (see rinder GREECE.)Dodecanese.389 It is believed that   the garrison of the DodecaneseIslands has been reinforced by the equivalent of one division since the 1st September.    No new formation has actually been identified., but the total strength of the garrisons throughout the Islands may now be about the equivalent of two divisions, exclusive of naval and airforce personnel.Libya.39. The methodical reinforcement of Libya which, began onthe 2lj.th. August was accelerated on the 9th September.    Rein-forcements, most of which have been sent to Western Libya, are estimated provisionally at a corps of three divisions pluscorps troops (tanks and medium artillery).    Reports ofidentifications are still conflicting.    The alternativesappear to be either that the Italians are trying to   concealthe scale of reinforcement or that they are drafting men ofdifferent units to make up to war strength the formations being sent overseas.    The latter is perhaps more likely, as it isreliably reported that 6,000 men have been evacuated fromTripoli, a fact which bears out the statement made by theItalian Ministry of Marine that troops would be moved both toand from Libya.1+0.. The net reinforcement of Eastern Libya is still obscure,as no details of the 6,000 men v&amp;io have arrived during the past week have been obtained, nor is it known whether any reservistsare being repatriated from that area.,,     There are no indications of unusual activity tov/ardstne Egyptian frontier. -1^-

ROUMANIA.41. The situation in Poland has caused the RoumanianGeneral Staff to concentrate over two-thirds of the armyon the northern frontier.    This leaves only two divisions in the Dobruja and a reserve of five infantry and onecavalry division in the Bucharest area.   Although thearmy contains 30 infantry divisions,  it is so weak in anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons that it could not longoppose an attack by modern armoured formations supportedby aircraft.YUGOSLAVIA.42. The strength of the Yugoslav Army has increased from 500.000 to 600,000 men, but delay in mobilising is*still being caused by deficiencies in accommodation,supply and transport.TURKEY.43. Little has been disclosed regarding defensive measures taken during the past week.    It is believed thatthe mobilisation of the Turkish Army is progressing andthat the army in Thrace is being completed to war strength.The estimated present strength of the Turkish Army &quot;is over400,000.GREECE.44. It is expected that the number of men under arms in north-west Greece will be gradually decreased during october,    This reduction in numbers is, however, dependenton a withdrawal of Italian forces from the Greco-Albanianfrontier.

FAR EAST.Russo-Japanese relations.45. On the 15th September a joint declaration of the cessation of hostilities on the Manchurian-Mongolianfrontier was signed by the Russian and Japanese Governments,,The declaration probably amounts to little more than a truce; certainly Japan has denied the negotiation of a non-aggression pact.Immediately the agreement had been signed, Japan putin hand further operations in China, chiefly along the Yangtse valley.Japanese intentions are not yet clear, but herimmediate object would appear to be to increase control overChinese communications, at SING-YANG (a road and riverjunction in north-west HUPEH) and on the CANTON-HANKOWrailway.The Russo-Japanese rapprochement has naturally beena cause of considerable concern to the Chinese Government.Still, whatever the outward situation, it seems likely thatChina will continue to receive some war material from theSoviet,  if only for the reason that the latter is unlikely to abandon surreptitious measures calculated to dissipateJapan&apos;s strength in China.Foreign Garrisons in China.46. The Japanese have not pressed their request for thewithdrawal of the armed forces of European Powers located in China,    This fact is primarily attributable to the unfavourable reaction of the American Government to thesuggestion.    The Tokyo authorities will undoubtedly handlethis problem with caution, until the European situationclarifies.    They have so far exercised a restraininginfluence over their military authorities in China, but the-15-

possibility of an incident arising from hasty action by alocal Japanese commander can not be ignored,AIR SITUATION.Disposition of German Air Force.47. Reports, which have been in circulation during thepast week, of large concentrations of bombers in N.W. Germanyand of impending attacks on Great Britain, have not been confirmed,,    Owing to the ease of concealing moves by air,especially when they are made at night,  it is difficult toobtain early warning of a re-distribution of air forces, but all reliable information points to some further withdrawl of bombers from the North West to the Frankfurt area.    Aconsiderable force,  in the region of 600 long range bombers,still remains however,  in the North West.48, The German official wireless announced on 18thSeptember that the air campaign in Poland had terminated.Owing to the need for overhauling aircraft and engines it is unlikely that the aircraft which have been taking part in&apos;these operations will be immediately available for operations in the West.    Furthermore the presence of 500 Russian bombers and 500 fighters   on the Eastern front,may force Germany toleave a larger force in Poland than would otherwise benecessary.Operations in Poland.49, .       It is now clear that one of the objectives given tothe German Air Force was the attack of Headquarters and thecentre of Government.    Headquarters were liable to attackwithin 24 hours of a move to a new location, and thisconstant harrying, with its effect on communications, was animportant factor in the final loss of control.

50. The attack was also directed against Governmentdepartments, and the British Ambassador has reported the&quot;bombing of the small town in which he was situated, which took place soon after the arrival of the Polish ForeignOffice.French Air Operations.51. During the week the French Air Force made a numberof useful reconnaissance flights over the line.    these aircraft apparently met with very little enemy resistance,although anti-aircraft artillery was active at times.German aircraft attacking French land forces have beendispersed by French fighters.    We have received no reportsof any French bombing operations.British Air Operations.52. No bombing operations have taken place (other thanattacks on submarines).    Bomber aircraft operating from thisCountry have made a number of special reconnaissances.    InFrance, aircraft of the Advanced Air Striking Force commencedlocal reconnaissances just over the line.    On one of theseflights three Battles had an engagement with three Germanfighters.    Two Battles and one fighter were shot down.Coastal Command aircraft have maintained routine searches,patrols and convoy escort duties daily during the week.    some modification to the normal patrol lines was found necessaryover the North Sea owing to enemy air opposition.Aircraft sighted submarines on 18 occasions, tenattacks were delivered, five with promising results.,fkntral War Room.21st September, 1939.
