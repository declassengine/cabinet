WAR CABINET.

CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE.

AIR DEFENCE OF SCAPA.

MEMORANDUM.

We have been considering the air defence of Scapa in view of the heavy scale of attack which might be brought to bear on the fleet in harbour there from aerodromes in North West Germany. We wish to bring to the notice of the War Cabinet the measures which we are taking, and to ask for approval for a long-term programme.

Anti-aircraft guns.

2. There are at present eight 4.5-inch guns at scapa Flow. The object of these is to protect the installations at Lyness when the Fleet is at sea, and to reinforce the guns of the Fleet when it is in harbour. The Committee of Imperial Defence authorised the provision in due course of a further sixteen 3.7-inch guns. The War Office are arranging to provide these additional guns as soon as possible, and have already ordered eight to be diverted from Belfast to Scapa.

3. Without denuding A.D.G.B., nothing further can be done at present to strengthen the gun defences. We have, however, despatched an Officer specially qualified

C.I.D. 358th Mtg., Conclusion 1(a)(ii).

- QOin air defence matters to examine the situation on the spot, in consultation with the Commander-in-Chief,Home Fleet, and to put forward proposals for a lay-out to cover all lines of approach to the anchorage. the implementation of such a scheme will he a long-termproject, and we will put forward definite proposals indue course.Searchlights.4. The defence of Scapa at night is a two-foldproblem.      First,  the harbour must he found after a longsea passage;    secondly, the attacker must pick out theships.      On all types of night other than bright moonlight,the chances of finding the harbour are remote, and provided no lights are exposed the ships would beindistinguishable from their background.     Furthermore, theconfiguration of the anchorage, and its surroundings, makeit impossible for a &quot;big enough lay-out of searchlightsto he installed to enable effective artillery fire to he brought to hear on fast high-flying aircraft.      Still lesscan a sufficiently deep lighted zone be provided for fighter aircraft.    - It has consequently been thought that completedarkness would be the best form of defence at night, andno searchlights have &quot;been provided.50 It is possible, however, that searchlights mightbe of value to dazzle and confuse the pilots of aircraft which have found the anchorage, and are attempting tomake low-flying attacks.      The truth of this suppositioncan only be estahlished &quot;by experience, but we propose tosend searchlights to Scapa Flow as soon as possible^This can he done without depleting A.D.G.B. -   The Officer

referred to in 3 above is examining the question inconsultation with the Commander-in-Chief, and thenumber of searchlights required will be known when his report is received.     The War Office are taking activesteps to make the personnel and material available at&apos; the first possible moment.Balloon Barrage.60 The provision of a full scale balloon barrage a form ofdefence which we strongly advocate, would require about250 balloons, of which 200 would have to be on floats.The administrative difficulties of maintaining the barragewould be very great., and in particular the supply ofhydrogen would present a very difficult problem.   Thematter is therefore a long-term project for fulfilmentas and when more material becomes available;    but inthe meanwhile, we strongly recommend that two Flightsof balloons (i.e. about 20 balloons) to be drawn partly from the London defences and partly from defences shortly to be provided in the provinces, should be sent to Scapaforthwith.     The moral effect of even a few balloonsv/iil be very great,  and experience will be gained in operating them, which will be very useful when thecomplete barrage can be built up.Fighter Defences.7. The provision of fighters for the defence of3EScapa was recently the subject of a Report by the HomeDefence Committee to the Committee of Imperial Defence.3  Paper No. C.I.D.  330 A,-3-/

The Home Defence Committee recommended &quot;by the following programme:-(a) Two fighter squadrons to be placed at Scapa.(b) Facilities to be provided to enable these two squadrons to operate and to be re-inforcedpif poeessary, by five squadrons from theair defence of Great Britain.     these facilities would include:-(i) A sector station,(ii) An aerodrome,(iii) A satellite aerodrome,(iv) The use of certain facilities at Wick.No decision was reached on these proposals by theCommittee of Imperial Defence,, and they were deferred for further consideration.8. We feel that the early provision of fighter squadrons at Scapa Flow is most desirable.      Wecannot, however, recommend that the air defence ofGreat Britain?which is    still   short of 15 squadrons,should be further depleted by taking two for Scapa.No organisation exists at present for the effectiveoperation of fighters at the latter place and it wouldnot be sound to rob an organisation in full working order to place squadrons where they could only operate at reduced efficiency.9. We do, however, recommend that the proposalsnof theHome Defence Committee (soo paragraph 7 above) should beinnediately authorised 9    mid the organisation  or operating-lighter squadrons completed   as soon as possible.In the meanwhile the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleetis being asked to consider the possibility of operating two fleet fighter squadrons from Wick whenever the fleet is in harbour.

10o       To sum up, we ask the War Cabinet to take note of the measures we propose to take for the immediatestrengthening of the air defence of Scapa, and we ask them to approve the following specific measures(a) The immediate provision of two flights ofballoons at the expense of localitiesfor which these defences have alreadybeen provided or approved.(to) The provision of a complete balloon barragewhen the production and administrativesituation will permit.(c) The addition to the already authorisedFighter Programme of 2 Squadrons to be permanently located at Scapa.    (Thesecannot be provided until next summer).(d) The immediate provision of a completeorganisation which will enable the above twofighter squadrons to operate at fullefficiency, and to he reinforced ifnecessary by five further squadrons.(Signed)    C.L.N.
