(^g) ^ and W.M. 19thConclusions ?- Minute 5 -and -20th Conclusions. - --Minute 8.REPORT.-,-,-The War Cabinet will recall that at the Meeting onthe l8th September55 the Chief of the Air Staff and the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff explained the military implications of a German advance through the Low countries and of the action which we should need to take in order tomake co-operation- between ourselves and the Belgian Armyeffective.     In particular it was emphasised that this action would include the immediate delivery of attacks on theadvancing German columns by our air force, even though this would almost inevitably involve casualties omonostDutch and Belgian troops- and civilians.     No discussion took place on this important point pending considerationby the War Cabinet of the Chiefs of Staff Report on thePossible Future Course of the War (W. p.  (59) 33).2. At the Meeting on tho 19th September when the aboveReport was discussed, no specific mention was made of thex   W.M.

action &quot;by air forces in the Low Countries and we have,therefore, thought it right to invite the attention of theWar Cabinet to a passage in our Report (W.M* (39) 33) which reads as follows&quot;As a German movement through the Low Countries couldonly be directed against the   Allies, it isessential that the Allied Air Forces should attackit the moment it startedo      This would mean ineffect that we should have to bomb any Dutch orBelgian towns that contained German troops&quot;.3. We consider that although we should get warning of heavy German concentrations near the Belgian and/or Dutchfrontiers, it is probable that the actual violation of dutch and Belgian territory would be sudden and would probablycommence at night.      It is aiso probable that, unless theDutch and Belgian demolition and inundation schemes were successfully carried out, the German advance would he very rapid in the early stages.4.- There is only one way in which we can stem this advance, namely by air action against the German columns,either while they are concentrating on Germany or assoon as possible after they have advanced into the low countries.      Plans for this operation have been worked out indetail and it is essential that they should be put into effect as soon as possible after the German invasion has taken place.If the German Army is given time to consolidate, this fleetingopportunity will be lost.5. There is no alternative to this course     of actionfrom the military point of view, but it is     only right thatthe War Cabinet should be seized of its full implications.6.        -lAs a result of the German invasion ofthe Low Countries the confusion in Holland andBelgium will he indescribable and the advancing

Gorman Ariay, the retreating Belgian and Dutch Armies,civilians end.refugees will be inextricably mixed uptogether.In these circumstances it will be impossible tosubject the Gorman columns to the full weight of our air attack without causing casualites to Dutch and Belgiansoldiers and civilians-;7. Nevertheless we emphasise   that the opportunityof inflicting&apos; a real blow on the enemy will be a fie stingone, and that our Commanders will run th; risk of lottingit slip, if they do not have discretion to put their pre-arranged plans into operation immediately they getcertain information of the Gorman movement.8. Tfile, therefore, ask for authority to give ourCommanders this discretion.9. Finally we point out That the French may co-operate with us in the action described above, but wedo not propose to wait for them before initiating theaction on our own account.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.&quot; RoFo ADAM(For C.I.G.S.)&quot; R.E.C.
