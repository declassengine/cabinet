I&quot;.&quot;.......&quot;f&quot;&quot;&apos;  -WAR    CABINET.CHIEFS OP STAFF COMMITTEE.BALKAN NEUTRALITY.ReportoasIn view of Sir P. Loraine&apos;s telegram   No. 795of 5th September we have considered whether at the presenttime and in the present circumstances it is preferable3from the military point of view-?-(a) to have &quot;the Balkan   Entente neutralso long as Italy also remains neutralsor(b) to have   Turkey9 Greece and Roumaniabelligerent on our side9 even though this would inevitably involve the accession of Italy to Germany.So We have no hesitation in saying that at thepresent time and in present circumstancess (a) is preferable from a military point of view.     We reach this conclusion partly for the reasons referred to bySir P. Loraines  and partly because it is desirable to restrict the actual area of military operations at least until such time as the resources of our Empire have been more fully mobilised.3e   Annex

3o We wish to emphasise9 howevers theimportance of ensuring that Turkey will interveneon our side at once if Italy should join Germany9or if the latter country extends her   militaryoperations into the Balkanso4. Whereas the intervention of Greece orRoumania on our side could only add to our immediatecommitmentss the addition of   Turkey to the ranks ofthe Allies would materially improve the alliedposition if Germany attempts a drive into the Balkans.(Signed)    0.

SPECIAL distribution and WAR CABINET,Decypher-,-..   Sir P. Lcraine (Rome),5th September, 1939.D.      9.50 p.m., 5th September,  1939.R.      2.00 a.m., 6th September, 1939.tvt^     *7q5 oIMPORTANT.Confidential.My French colleague has some indication: of an arrangement..whereby Italy most likely will come into the war on the Germanside if Western Powers organise a front in the Balkans,2. Yugoslav Minister came to see me this morning and before i could carry out my intention to draw him launched out on thesubject himself most voluminously.3. He laid the utmost emphasis on keeping Italy neutralfrom point of view of Balkan, countries.     He said there was noshadow of doubt that if the allies tried to attack Germanythrough the Balkans b.r?th Italy   and the U.S.S.R. would intervene.His views he said were his own personal ones but what he said he felt sure was the truth and he said that his opinion was probably held by the Hungarians, Roumanians, Greeks andYugoslavs.4. When I asked what he thought would happen if assistance was sent through Roumania to Poland, Monsieur Cristitch repliedthat it would be the end of everything.      In the first place the-3-

available assistance would be of no use in saving the Poles.Germany as a result would promptly occupy Budapest and would soon possess herself of Bucharest,      Yugoslav Minister saidthat the Roumanian army was worthless and would put up little or no resistance especially after the defeat of Poland.Russia would take back Bessarabia.; Italy could push throughAlbania to the Aegean Sea, Bulgaria would be spared and givenback Bobrudjaa      The Western Fewers would, merely have presentedGermany witn a series of easy and striking military successes.Monsieur Crist-itch repeatedly went back to his point of necessity for maintaining Italy5 s neutralityt     He thoughtthat the Western Powers even at the cost of some sacrificeshould satisfy her demands and t ire. care not to createdisputes arising from naval control in &quot;oke Mediterranean,5. Italy according to Monsieur Cristitch could not remainwithout compensation at the next Treaty of Peace and it was essential to placate her now if it was not possible to win herover to our side,      Yugoslav Minister said that it was a dangerous illusion to think that the Western Powers could do anything effective against Germany by making use of the balkan states.      No amount of valour- these people displayed couldavail against modern German technique- and again repeated thatany alliance interference in the Balkans would let looseGerman and Italian troops in those countries and in hisopinion it would render the task of the allies far more difficultthan it was already,6. After unloading himself of these gloomy forebodingsMonsieur Cristitch tentatively ?-ked whether there was. not still

any means of stopping the war.     That he should ask such aquestion proves how dangerous he thinks is the position of hisand the Balkan countries.7.        As YOur Lordship knows I am strongly in favour of keeping Italy out af the war.     Also if my experience of Balkanconditions entitles me to say so I agree that it would be avery grave error to give Germany opportunity of attacking theSouth-East through the Balkans;    and if you remember Iadvocated on several occasions from Angora the theory that in theevent of a European war it would be wisest to leave BalkanEntente neutral at least in the initial stages.      I submit that so long as Italy abstains from hostilities this argumentbecomes far stronger.Addressed to Foreign Office No. 795;    repeated toBelgrade and Angora.
