HE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.RET.39) 20.COPY NO.  ??&amp;WAP CABINET.PROMOTING TRADE WITH ITALY.Report by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1.I have been in communication with the Departmentswho would be particularly concerned, and the summary ofour needs from Italy and our possibilities of further supplies to her are as follows.(a) Ministry of Supply.     The Ministry of Supply wouldprobably be prepared to make purchases during the next twelve months to an amount of about  3 millions which would include fuses and instruments, explosives, hides, sulphur,machine tools, etc., and also some anti-aircraft equipment,if, indeed, the last named was worth having as it may notbe considered satisfactory by the General Staff.(a) War- Office.     All relevant War Office supplies arenow obtained through the Ministry of Supply so that theWar Office is no longer directly concerned.(c) Admiralty.      The Admiralty are at present buyingItalian Isotta engines for motor torpedo boats and. thequestion is under discussion whether these engines could also be used for anti-submarine boats.     The admiralty would also like the Ministry of Supply to buy hemp at a cost of  385,000 and mercury at a cost of  80,000.2 &amp;What we need from Italy.

Ji.(d) Air Ministry.     A letter from the Air Ministry of 7th September states that they could not usefully formulaterequirements in the absence of more precise information asto what might be available.      The Air Ministry think thatthe necessary information could only be obtained by sending a technical mission to Italy.(e) Food.      The Ministry of Food say that it isimportant to maintain our purchases of lemons from Italy(some  600,000 a year).      Other commodities, e.g. olive oil,are non-essentials.      They add that we could give very greathelp to Italy by allowing her, when she is buying wheat, towork in with us and obtain the wheat at a cheaper price.We are already doing this for countries such as Belgium and holland.      Co-operation with Italy would suit us as other-wise we have to buy against Italian competition.3. What could we supply to Italy?(a) Coal.      The Secretary for Mines has put theposition fully before the President of the Board of Tradeand I have seen his letter.     He suggests that as animmediate measure we should supply 800,000 tons during theremainder of this year, for which Italy has alreadycontracted, provided that the Italians themselves send here the Italian ships which are now lying in Rotterdam.      I now understand, that certain of these ships have leftRotterdam in the hope of loading coal here.Italy has contracted to purchase 3 million tons ofour coal for 1940.      If we supply this coal to Italy it canonly be done by cutting down supplies at home and abroad and the Secretary for Mines will consider how best thenecessary saving can be effected.      Of course, a greaterproduction could be secured by working longer hours,  etc.,

but we may be forced to arrange longe-r...hours...to-^securethe output of 260,000,000 tons a year which is ouranticipated demand without any provision for Italy.(t)) Other commodities, e.-p;. fish and wool.    Theseare less important, but the BOard of Trade have been lookinginto the details and tabulating them.4, The result of this seems to me to be as follows.It may be desirable to offer to send the suggestedtechnical mission from the Air Ministry in order to givethe Italians the feeling that we are forthcoming, but itis questionable whether anything will come of it as theAir Ministry may well find that what the Italians can sellis not satisfactory for our Air Force.     Whether the&apos;Ministry of Supply would need to send a mission to Italybefore buying hemp, hides, mercury, etc., is for that ministry to say.5. On the subject of payment for purchases from Italy,our trade with Italy is conducted under a Clearing Agreement,that is to say, if the Air Ministry buy aeroplanes from italy, they pay in sterling to the Anglo-Italian ClearingOffice in London.      Italians who buy coal from us pay inlire to the Clearing Office in Rome.     Hitherto the Italianshave bought more from us than we from them and arrears areowed to our exporters to the amount of about  750,000.&apos;Prom our own point of view, it would suit us to buyas much as we can throixgh the Clearing and not to increase our sales to Italy so that the arrears to our traders shouldbe wiped off and we should get into debt to Italians tradersand thus force Italy to sell to us on credit.     But after acertain point; no doubt the Italians would refuse to sellaeroplanes to us except for sterling or for United Statescollars.     Thus, in order to secure our own supplies, aswell as to please the Italians, we should have to maintain and increase as far as possible our exports to Italy if weare to increase by tiny great extent our purchases from them.-3-

60 It might, he well, in broaching the topic of coal supplies to Italy, to say tc them that we ration our coal supplies to ourselves according to our essential needs and thatin doing what we can for Italy we should of course need to observe   these needs0 The coal must be carried in italian ships (possibly we could urge that the ships should bring us bach iron ore from Northern Spain, if thatis practicable).     The remaining point ought to be that weshould not make an unconditional promise for a long timeahead but should keep our hand on the stream of supplies and feed Italy from hand to mouth.7. There remains however what is perhaps a most vitalpoint.     The whole of our plan of blockade or economic warfare against Germany rests on being able to reach agreement with neutrals, or, by our own naval measures, to force neutrals not to obtain supplies which they willsubsequently pass on to Germany.     Italy occupies a keyposition in this respect.     Unless we can somehow avoidItaly acting as a channel by which other neutrals can sendsupplies to Germany, it is really not much use our takinginfinite pains to prevent other countries, such as sweden and Norway, from acting as channels for these supplies toreach Germany.      It follows that any instrument which we might use as a lever to secure Italy&apos;s good behaviour isof special value, and it is a matter for consideration whether we ought to give this instrument av/ay or weakenits force by concessions which in another connection may&quot;be politic as tending to keep Italy on good terms with us. -September, iqsq.
