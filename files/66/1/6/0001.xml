Paper No. D.P. (P.) 50.)Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,I. Introduction.IN April 1989, the Chiefs of Staff prepared a Memorandum on the Organi-sation of the Higher Command in France in war (C.I.D. Paper No. D.P. (P.) 50).In this Memorandum they summarised the arrangements that were made duringthe Great War for the Higher Command of the British and French Armies inFrance, starting with the instructions issued to Sir John French in August 1914emphasising that his &apos;&apos; command is an entirely independent one &apos;&apos; and that hewould &quot; in no case come in any sense under the orders of any allied General,&quot; andculminating with the appointment of General Foch as Commander-in-chief of theAllied Forces on the western front.2. The Chiefs of Staff summarised the conclusions which they drew fromthe experiences of 1914-1918 in the following terms : &quot; (a) Independent command may be satisfactory when operations are pro-progressing favourably, particularly if the situation is comparativelystable. It is, however, apt to lead to dangerous situations in times ofemergency.(b) Unified command is undoubtedly more efficient from the point of viewof the conduct of operations. The objection is that the BritishGovernment, in effect, hand over to the French Government the controlof the destiny of the British Army, for which they themselves must remain responsible to the nation. This objection can be overcome by allowing the British Commander the right of appeal to his own government, though there is, of course, the danger that such appealmight cause delay in operations.&quot;3. The Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff was considered by the Committeeof Imperial Defence at a meeting held on the 2nd May, 1939.* In the course ofthe discussion, it was pointed out that the Paper by the Chiefs of Staff did nottouch the larger problem of Supreme Control in war by the Allied Governments;and it was assumed that any British Army employed in France would not beplaced under the control of the French political Authorities, but under the orders of a French Supreme Commander, who, in turn, would be under the direction ofan Inter-Allied Council. Accordingly, the Committee of Imperial defence i agreed: &quot; (a) To invite the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, in consultation withthe Service Ministers, to prepare a Memorandum on the SupremeIControl of the war by the Allied Governments.&apos;&apos;* * * * * ** Minutes of the C.I.D./3S5th Meeting, Minute 5.[19520]   [19858] B
4. This Memorandum, which has been prepared in consultation with theService Ministers and Chiefs of Staff, is submitted, in accordance with the aboveconclusion. Its object is to describe the arrangements for inter-allied controlthat were devised during the last war, and to consider : (a) whether the general principles underlying, these arrangements are applicable to a future war; and(b) if so, whether there should be any modifications in the arrangementsowing to the changes which have taken place since 1918.5. It is to be noted that this Memorandum does not take into account theposition that will arise if Dominion forces are serving on the Continent or else-where. This aspect of the problem cannot be usefully considered until a decision has been taken as to the system under which the Imperial war effort is to become-ordinated and controlled&quot;.II.-Historical.6. * &quot; During;the Great War, 1914-18, various systems were tried with theidea of promoting inter-allied co-operation. In the early period there were inter-governmental Conferences at frequent intervals to adjust the plans of the differentAllies; in fact, from the very beginning there had been a strongly markedtendency to substitute frequent personal meetings between Ministers and Depart-mental chiefs of the different Governments for the older and more formal channels of communication.&quot;The Supreme War Council.7. As the war progressed and the theatres of operations multiplied, theimportance of establishing some more effective and continuous system ofco-ordination became apparent. &quot; I am convinced,&quot; wrote Mr. Lloyd George ina lettert dated the 30th September, 1917, to President Wilson, &quot; from myexperience of the last three years that the comparative failure of the Allies in1917 is also in some measure due to defects in their mutual arrangements for conducting the War.As compared with the enemy the fundamental weakness of the jeviiiss isthat the direction of their military operations lacks real unity. At a very early stage of the War, Germany established a practically despotic dominion over allher Allies. She not only reorganised their armies and assumed direction of their military strategy, but she took control also over their economic resources, so thatthe Central Empires and Turkey to-day are to all intents and purposes a militaryEmpire with one command and one front. The allies, on the other hand, havenever followed suit. The direction of the War on their side has remained in thehands of four separate Governments and four separate General Staffs (namelythose of France, Great Britain, Italy and Russia) each of which is possessed of complete knowledge only of its own front and its own national resources, andwhich draws up a plan of campaign which is designed to produce results mainly on its own section of front. The defects of this system have not been lost sight of.From time to time of late with greatly increased frequency there have been Inter-national Conferences to discuss the Allied war plans. But up to the present these conferences have done little more than attempt to synchronise what are in realityfour separate plans of campaign. There has never been an A Hied Body which hadknowledge of the resources of all the Allies and which could prepare a singleco-ordinated plan for utilising those resources in the most decisive manner, and atthe most decisive points, looking at the front of the Central Powers as a whole and taking into account their political, economic and diplomaJic as well as their military weaknesses.&quot;At the forthcoming Conferences, which will assemble as soon as the resultsof the present offensives have become clear, / shall urge the imperative importanceof establishing more effective unity in the Allied strategy.&quot;* Extract from a note (C.I.D. Paper No. 882-B), prepared by Sir Maurice (now Lord)Hankey in May, 1928, for the information of the Committee of Imperial Defence,f War Memoirs of David Lloyd George, pp. 2350-2353.
Later, in the saane letter, there occurs the following passage : &quot; . . . .-i  we are to make the best possible use of the forces at thedisposal of the Allies, it is of supreme importance to establish effectiveunity in the direction of the &quot;War on the Allied side. If we are to avoidwasted effort and wanton loss of life, those who draw up the plan of campaignmust have full knowledge of the resources of all. the Allies, not only in menand munitions, but in shipping, railway material, and so forth, so as to deter-mine how they can best be employed against the enemy organisation. In myopinion it will be necessary to establish some kind of Allied Joint Council,with permanent military and probably naval and economic staffs attached towork out the plans for the Allies, for submission to the several Governmentsconcerned.&quot;8. On the 20th October, 1917, Lord French and Sir Henry Wilson submittedMemoranda* to the War Cabinet, summarising the whole military position. Bothof these papers pointed to the conclusion that it was essential to establish at once a Supreme Council of the Allies.9. On the 30th October, 1917, Mr. Lloyd George wrote to M. Painleve, theFrench Minister for War, in much the same sense as he had written to president Wilson the previous month (see paragraph 7 above), but elaboratinghis conception of a Supreme War Council rather more fully in the followingtermst : &quot; . . . . If we are to win the War, it will only be because the allied nations are willing to subordinate everything else to the supreme purposeof bringing to bear upon the Central Empires in the most effective mannerpossible the maximum pressure, military, economic and political, which theAllies can command.&quot; There is, I am sure, only one way in which this can be done, and thatis by creating a joint council a kind of Inter-Allied General Staff to workout the plans and watch continuously the course of events, for the Allies asa whole. This council would not, of course, supersede the severalGovernments. It would simply be advisory to them, the final decisions, andthe orders necessary to give effect to them, being given by the Governmentsconcerned. But it would be a council possessed of full knowledge of theresources of all the Allies, not only in men and munitions, but in shipping,railway material and so forth, which would act as a kind of General staff to the alliance to advise as to the best methods of winning the war, looking at the fronts and the resources available as a whole. Its composition mightbe settled later. But provisionally I would suggest that it should consistof one, or perhaps two, political representatives of first-rate authority from each of the Allies, with a military Staff of its own and possibly Naval andEconomic Staffs as well. The Military representatives would remain incontinuous session at whatever place was chosen as the scene of the Council&apos;slabours, and could therefore not be the same people as the Chiefs of theseveral National General Staffs, though they would have to be in the closest touch with them. It would also be the same with the naval and economicstaffs if it were found necessary to attach them, also.&quot;10. On the 2nd November the British War Cabinet accepted in principle(W.C. 263 (13) (a)) the proposal for the establishment of a Supreme Inter-allied council in the following terms : :&apos;&apos; To accept in principle the proposal for the establishment of a SupremeInter-Allied Council consisting of the Prime Minister and one other Minister,who would meet at frequent intervals, together with a Permanent Inter-AlliedAdvisory General Staff composed of one General Officer from each of theprincipal Allies.&quot;* These memoranda are Papers W.P. 60 and 61.

At the same Meeting Mr. Lloyd George reported that he had seen M. Painleveand that the French Government accepted the scheme for the establishment of a supreme Inter-Allied Council and Permanent Advisory General Staff.Mr. Lloyd George also reported that General Petain cordially approved thescheme^ and had expressed the opinion that, in view of the very serious positioDon the Italian front, the new organisation should be set to work as soon as possible.II. Opportunity was taken at the Rapalio Cor ?erence* (the 5th-7thNovember, 1917), which was mainly concerned with th Caporetto disaster, to approve the scheme of organisation of the Supreme War Council and the termsof reference to the Permanent Military Representatives (Annexes to paper i.C. 30). The first Meeting of the Supreme War Council was held at 4 p.m. on the7th November.To give effect to this scheme, the following resolutions were &quot;iopted : :.&apos; I. The representatives of the British, French and Italif Governmentsassembled at Bapallo on the 7th November, 1917, have agreed on the scheme forthe orga usation of a Supreme War Council with a Permanent Military Repre-sentativc from each Power, contained in the following paragraph : Scheme of Organisation of a Supreme War Council.II. (1) With a view to the better co-ordination of military action on theWestern Front, a Supreme War Council is created, composed of the PrimeMink ^r and a Member of the Government of each of the Great Powers whosearmie. are fighting on that front. The extension of the scope of the Council toother fronts is reserved for discussion with the other Great Powers.(2) The Supreme War Council has for its mission to watch over the generalconduct of the war. It prepares recommendations for the decision of the Govern-ments, and keeps itself informed of their execution and reports thereon to therespective Governments.(3) The General Staffs and Military Commands of the armies of each Powercharged wii^ the conduct of military operations remain responsible to theirrespective Governments.(4) The general war plans drawn up by the competent Military Authoritiesare submitted to the Supreme War Council, which, under the high authority ofthe Governments, ensures their concordance, and submits, if need be, any necessary changes.(5) Each Power delegates to the Supreme War Council one permanent military Representative, whose exclusive function is to act as technical adviser to the Council.(6) The Military Representatives receive from the Government and thecompetent Military Authorities of their country all the proposals, information and documents relating to the conduct of the war.(7) The Military Representatives watch day by day the situation of theforces, and of the means of all kinds of which the Allied armies and the enemyarmies dispose.(8) The Supreme War Council meets normally at Versailles, where thePermanent Military Representatives and  heir Staffs are established. They maymeet at other places as may be agreed up -u, according to circumstances. the meetings of the Supreme War Council will take place at least once a month.III. The Permanent Military Representative will be as follows:  For France : Greneral Fetch.For Great Britain : General Wilson.For Italy: General Cadorna.&quot;In Annex II to Paper I.C. 30 will be found the approved terms of reference tothe Permanent I llitary Representatives.12. It is to be noted that the Supreme War Council had no executive power,and that the final decisions rested with the several Governments of the Allies.* The proceedings of the Conference are recorded in Papers Nos. I.C. 29-32.
This is evident from the reply that was given by Mr. Lloyd George, on the10th November, 1917, to the following Question put to him by Mr. Asquith* :  &quot; Whether he will now state to the House what are the precise functionsof the proposed Inter-Allied Council, and in particular of its Military Staff;Whether it is proposed that the Council is, if so advised by its Staff,to have power to interfere with or override the opinion on matters of strategyof the General Staff at home, and of the Commanders-in-Chief in the field;Whether the Military Staff of the Inter-Allied Council is to haveIntelligence and Operations Departments, or either of them, of its own;Whether the ultimate decision as to the distribution and movements ofthe various Armies in the field is to rest with the Council, or with theGovernments represented upon it.&quot;. Mr. Lloyd George replied as follows: &quot; 1. With a view to the better co-ordination of military action on theWestern Front, a Supreme War Council is created, composed of the PrimeMinister and a Member of the Government of each of the Great Powers whoseArmies are fighting on that front. The extension of the scope cf the Councilto other fronts is reserved for discussion with the other Great Powers.2. The Supreme War Council has for its mission to watch over thegeneral conduct of the war. It prepares recommendations for the decisionof the Governments, and keeps itself informed of their execution, and reportsLhereon to the respective Governments.3. The General Staffs and Military Commands of the Armies of eachPower charged with the conduct of military operations remain responsible to their respective Governments.4. The general War plans drawn up by the competent militaryauthorities are submitted to the Supreme War Council, which, under thehigh authority of the Governments, ensures their concordance, and submits,if need be, any necessary changes.5. Each Power delegates to the Supreme War Council one permanent military Representative, whose exclusive function is to act as technicaladviser to the Council.6. The Military Representatives receive from the Government and thecompetent military authorities of their country all the proposals, information and documents relating to the conduct of the war.7. The Military Representatives watch day by day the situation of theForces, and the means of all kinds of which the Allied Armies and theEnemy Armies dispose.8. The Supreme War Council meets normally at Versailles, where thepermanent Military Representatives and their Staffs are established. Theymay meet at other places as may be agreed upon, according to the circum-stances. The meetings of the Supreme War Council will take place at leastonce a month.From the foregoing, it will be clear that the Council will have no executive power, and that the final decisions in matters of strategy andas to the distribution and movements of the various Armies in the fieldwill rest with the several Governments of the Allies. There will be, there-fore, no Operations Department attached to the Council. The permanent military Representatives will derive from, the existing Intelligence Depart-ments of the Allies all the information necessary in order to enable them tosubmit advice to the Supreme Allied Council. The object of the Allieshas been to set up a central body charged with the duty of continuouslysurveying the field of operations as a whole and, by the light of informationderived from all fronts and from all Governments and Staffs, of co-ordinating the plans prepared by the different General Staffs, and, if necessary, ofmaking proposals of their own for the better conduct of the war.&quot;The Supreme War Council was thus, in effect, an Inter-Allied Committeeof Imperial Defence, and not an Inter-Allied Cabinet.* Parliamentary Debates (Commons) 1917, vol. XCIX, cols. 389-390.
13. The Supreme War Council held eight sessions during the 12 monthswhich elapsed between its institution and the conclusion of the Armistice.*These are described in the following extracts:from a Note&apos;!&quot; prepared for theCommittee of Imperial Defence by Sir Maurice (now Lord) Hankey : &apos;c The first session of the Council took place at Eapallo on the 7th November,1917, and was attended1 by Ministers, and military experts of Great Britain&apos;France and Italy. Later, the United States signified their concurrence in theformation of the Council, and appointed their Chief of Staff as the american military Representative.The second session was held at Versailles on the 1st December, and was attended by Ministers of the three Allied Governments with their military staffs,and also by the American military representative. At this session a number ofresolutions were passed in regard to the functions of the Supreme War Counciland the supply of information to the military representatives of the associated governments; and the permanent secretarial staffs of the respective countries were instructed to organise, in concert, a joint secretarial bureau for theproduction and distribution of the notices, agenda, protocols and proces-verbaiixof the meetings of the Supreme War Council, and of such other collectivebusiness it might be found desirable to entrust to it. The secretarial businessof the second session was conducted on lines identical with those which it hadbeen convenient to follow in the case of meetings of the War Cabinet. this procedure, with certain modifications, was eventually adopted by the supreme war Council.The third session was held at Versailles from the 30th January to the2nd February, 1918. The following important resolution, among others, waspassed : The Council decided on the &apos; creation of a General Reserve for thewhole of the armies on the Western, Italian and Balkan Fronts,&apos;&quot; and delegated&apos; to an Executive, composed of the permanent military representatives of GreatBritain, Italy and the United States of America, with Marshal Foch for France,&apos;certain powers in regard to the General Reserve to be exercised in consultationwith the Commanders-in-Chief of the armies concerned. The ExecutiveCommittee, which was afterwards called the Executive War Board of theSupreme War Council, met on eight occasions, at each of which Marshal Fochpresided, to discuss the composition and location of the General Reserve. for various reasons, however, no complete agreement had been arrived at by thefourth session of the Council, which took place in London on the 14th March andfollowing, days. On the 21st March the Germans, after most careful preparations,began an attack on the British on a vast scale, with 95 divisions on a front of50 miles. The attack was successful in effecting a breach of the front, and therewas a very considerable withdrawal of British troops. The situation beingextremely critical, Lord Milner, as Secretary of State for War, was sent over bythe British Government to Compiegne to ascertain exactly what the situation was and to confer with the French and British Commanders as to the best methodof effecting unity of command. He attended ah important Conference at Doullenson the 26th March, when it was decided, with the full consent of the Generalspresent, that Marshal Foch should be appointed to co-ordinate the efforts of theBritish and French armies. This appointment deprived the Executive war board of its raison d&apos;etre, and it was accordingly dissolved by resolution of the fifth session of the Supreme War Council, which was held at Abbeville on the1st and 2nd May, 1918. Shortly afterwards Marshal Foch was given the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces on the Western Front.At the fifth session of the Supreme War Council it was decided that thepowers of co-ordination conferred by the &apos; Doullens Agreement&apos; on Marshal Fochshould be extended to the Italian front, that is to say, if the Allied Armies should both in Frauce and Italy become involved in a general action, Marshal Foch shouldbe the Commander-in-Chief of the whole front from the North Sea to the Adriatic,subject to the proviso that the Commander-in-Chief of any one of the allied armies would have the right to appeal to his own Government if he consideredthat the safety of his Army was compromised by any order received from theGener al-in- Chief.* A very full summary of the activities and proceedings of the Council from its inceptionon the 7th November, 1917, is available in the War Cabinet Papers (Paper G. 265).f C.I.D. Paper No. 882-B, Part III.
The sixth and seventh sessions of the Council were held at Versailles from the1st to the 3rd June and from the 2nd to the 4th July,* respectively, and dealt withthe pressing necessities of that critical military period.The eighth session of the Supreme War Council was held in Paris andVersailles from the 31st October to the 4th November, when the conditions of theArmistice with the Central Powers were drawn up and approved. This meeting was attended for the first time by a political representative of the United Statesof America.&quot;Permanent Military Representatives.It will be seen from paragraph 9 above that it was decided at Rapallo that a-joint staff of permanent military representatives, one from each of the alliedPowers, with appropriate staffs attached to each, should be established at versailles to act as technical advisers to the Supreme War Council.&quot;The permanentt Military Representatives held altogether fifty-onemeetings from the date of creation of the Supreme War Council up to the last meeting held in 1918, which took place on the 12th November the day after the signing of the Armistice. The subjects of discussion were remitted to the military representatives in one or other of the following ways : (i) The Supreme War Council might at one of its meetings refer questions to the Military Representatives for examination and an expression oftheir views.(ii) Any Military Representative might summon a meeting at any time todiscuss questions referred to the Military Representatives by anyAllied Government,(iii) Any Military Representative might summon a meeting to consider aquestion which he wished to raise on his own initiative.&apos;&apos;14. When the Supreme War Council was first set up, the relationship between the British Military Representative and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff at the War Office was very different from that which existed betweenthe French Military Representative and the French C.G.S. Sir Henry Wilsonwas entirely &quot; independent! of the War Office,&quot; and was thus &quot;in a position toexpress views .... which might be totally at variance with the views entertainedby the military authorities in Whitehall.&quot; The French $ arrangement was a very different one. General &quot;Weygand was! a subordinate of the French C.G.S.,Foch; he represented Foch&apos;s views, and he was in no sense an outsider set up to tender counsel independently of, and in opposition to, the principal officialmilitary adviser of the French Government.&quot;However, it soon became manifest that there were &quot; objectionsll to theMilitary Representative at Versailles and the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff being officials of equal standing, of their being wholly independent of one another, and of their holding diametrically opposing views on questions of thevery first moment.&quot; Consequently, at a later date the British Military Represen-tative was made, in a measure, subordinate to the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, just as General Weygand was subordinate to Marshal Foch.15. The following description of the organisation and procedure of theBritish Staff at Versailles is taken from the Life and Diaries of Field-marshal sir Henry Wilson^ : &quot;There were three Sections: &apos;A&apos; (&apos; Allies&apos;), &apos;E&apos; (&apos;Enemy&apos;) and.&apos;M&apos; (&apos;Material&apos;); Section A was in charge of Colonel H. W. Studd and dealtwith the Allies; Section E was under Hereward Wake and dealt with the enemy;Section M, under Brigadier-General (now Major-General Sir F.) Sykes, dealt* The Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Newfoundland were presentwr the first time on the last day of the Council [Official History of the Great War.

Section E collected information from all available sources as tothe strength, disposition and so forth of enemy military forces in the varioustheatres of war, and regarded the strategical situation as a whole entirely fromthe enemy&apos;s point of view; Wake and his assistants, in fact, put themselves inthe-place &quot;of the enemy General Staffs, and thought out what would be the right course; iV.the enemy to pursue in given circumstances.. . . .

Their duty was to submit reasoned conclusions to the Council,collectively, with regard to any subject that the Council thought fit to refer tothem. The conclusions were drawn up in the form of joint &apos; Notes,&apos; the terms ofwhich were argued out and agreed to at the meetings of the Representatives.The Notes&apos; were then signed by the Representatives and forwarded to the council&apos;s secretariat as &apos; Resolutions.&apos; The Council at its next meeting agreedto, or rejected (as the case might be), a resolution thus submitted to it. If theresolution was agreed to, executive action in accordance with its terms wassupposed to be taken by the Government or Governments concerned.....&quot;Other Inter-Allied Organisations.16. In addition to the Supreme War Council, with its permanent military representatives, a number of other inter-allied organisations were set up in thecourse of the war to co-ordinate specific aspects of war plans and activities. Thefollowing examples are taken from a Note* prepared in 1928 by Sir Maurice(now Lord) Hankey for the information of the Committee of Imperial Defence :-(a) The Inter-Allied Naval Council.&quot;In December 1917 a permanent Inter-Allied Naval Council consistingof the Ministers of Marine of the Nations concerned and the Chiefs of theNaval Staffs was created; its function was to &apos; watch over the generalconduct of the naval war and to ensure the co-ordination of effort at sea,as well as the development of ail scientific operations connected with theconduct of the War.&apos; &quot;(b) The Allied Maritime Council.&quot;Early in 1918 the Allied Maritime Transport Council was created,consisting of two Ministers each of France, Italy and Great Britain, andtwo representatives of the United States of America. The purpose of theCouncil was to supervise the general conduct of Allied transport, in order toobtain the most effective use of tonnage for the prosecution, of the war, while leaving each nation responsible for the management of the tonnage under its own control.With this object the Council secured the necessary exchange of informa-tion, and co-ordinated the policy and action of the four Governments ofFrance, Italy, the United States of America and Great Britain in adjustingtheir programmes of imports to the carrying capacity of the available Alliedtonnage (having regard to naval and military requirements) and in makingthe most advantageous allocation and disposition of such tonnage inaccordance with the urgency of war needs.The Council had at its service a permanent organisation consisting of four sections (French, Italian, American and British), the head of the BritishSection being Secretary to the Council. The Council obtained, through itspermanent staff, the programmes of import requirements for each of themain classes of essential imports,- and full statements as to the tonnage available to the respective Governments. It examined the import programmes in relation to the carrying power of the available tonnage inorder to ascertain the extent of any deficit, and considered the means wherebyC.I.D. Paper No. 882-B, Part III.
such a deficit might be met, whether by a reduction in the import programmes, by the acquisition, if practicable, of further tonnage for importing work, or by the more economical and co-operative use&apos; of thetonnage already available.The members of the Council reported to their respective governments with a view to securing that the decisions and action required to give effectto any recommendations made by the Council were taken in their respective countries.&quot;17.   A diagram of inter-allied war organisation, as it existed in November., III. Arrangements,,foe Intek-Allied Controls in a Future War.lo. &apos; The experiences of 1914-18 indicate that Inter-Allied co-operation inany future war can best be promoted by the same sort of system as was initiatedin 1917. This system will, however, have to be mcdified and adapted to meet theparticular conditions with which we are likely to be confronted.19. In the last war Russia had fallen out before&apos; a Supreme War council was set up. Consequently, so far as an allied effort was concerned, there was toall intents and purposes a single and almost continuous front extending from theBelgian coast to Italy.20. The situation which we must now contemplate is that there will be threedistinct and widely separated fronts the Western European front, the eastern european front (Poland, and possibly Roumania and Russia), and a Greco-Turkish front. The problem, therefore, is to devise machinery which will ensure effective co-ordination of the war effort of widely separated Allies.21. It might seem at first sight that, in view of the difficulty of comiminica-tion between these Allies, it would be advisable to have Inter-Allied Councils ineach of the main theatres. It is felt, however, that this would defeat the wholeidea of unity of effort. It is therefore recommended that there should be a singleSupreme War Council on which all theu Members of the Coalition should berepresented.22. Before suggesting what form this representation should take in eachcase, it will be convenient to consider the most appropriate venue for the meetingsof the Council. Clearly this must rest between France and England, and, for thereasons that follow, the latter suggests itself as the more suitable.23. Somewhere in England would probably be more suitable than in Francefrom the point of view of security from air attack. Secondly, the question ofmercantile tonnage will be of even greater importance in the next war than itwas in the last. It will be one of the main factors governing the preparation ofwar plans. The concentration of shipping interests in England renders itdesirable that the organ responsible for the preparation of these plans shouldbe located as near as possible to these interests.24. It is possible that the French would agree to the suggestion that theSupreme War Council should meet in England.25. Irrespective, however, of whether the Council meets in England orFrance, it is suggested that each of these countries should have the samerepresentation on it as they had on the last occasion, i.e., the Prime Minister andone other Minister.26. Owing to difficulties of communication, it would clearly be impossiblefor the Prime Minister, or perhaps any Minister, of the other parties to the coalition, such as Turkey and Poland, to attend frequent sessions of the supreme war Council. It is therefore suggested that these distant Powers might berepresented on the Council by their Ambassadors. This matter should bediscussed with the Governments concerned after agreement has been reached withthe French.27. It might here be mentioned that it is contemplated that the constitutional position of the Supreme War Council of the future should be identical with thatof the Council of 1917-18 (see paragraph 12 above), i.e., it should have no power to[19520]c
make final decisions, but would make recommendations to the Allied Governments.Inasmuch, however, as the British and French representatives on the supreme war Council would include the British and French Prime Ministers, it can beassumed that the recommendations of the Council would be accepted by the Frenchand British Governments.28. The position of the more distant Powers, such as Turkey and Poland,would be somewhat different,, if, as is suggested in the preceding paragraph, these powers were to be represented on the Council by their Ambassadors. The need for ensuring rapid and willing acquiescence by the Eastern Powers in therecommendations of the Supreme War Council sitting in London is a strong arguement in favour of the despatch of Franco-British Missions at the outset ofhostilities to the Eastern and graeco-Turkish fronts.29. Such Missions would also serve the purpose of securing closer co-opera-tion between all the members of the coalition. In co-operation with the Britishand French Ambassadors, and Turkey and Poland, they would assist in theco-ordination of the Allied effort by explaining and elaborating the recommend a-tions of the Supreme War Council to the authorities of these countries, and by sending to the Supreme War Council accurate information, which might not beotherwise available, of the situation in their respective theatres of war. In thisconnection the &quot; key &quot; position of Ankara is to be specially noted.30. Turning now to the question of the system to be adopted for the submission of technical advice to the Supreme War Council, it is suggested thatat the seat of the Supreme War Council there should be permanent military representatives of each of the countries concerned, working in close and continuous co-operation with each other, and charged exclusively with the collective duty of advising the Supreme War Council as a whole.31. It is essential that these technical Advisers should not advise or act independently of the Supreme Naval, Military and Air authorities of theirrespective countries. In other words, the principle should be that which was followed by France, Italy and the United States of America during the great war, and not that initially&apos;adopted by Great Britain, who started by having apermanent Military Adviser, who Was1 entirely independent of the War Office(see paragraph 14 above). &apos;!&apos;&apos;r&apos;!Ii-i-32. So far as the representation of the United Kingdom is concerned, it isnecessary to take into account the changes which have occurred since 1918.particularly (a) the creation of an independent Air Ministry; and (&amp;) the creationof the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.33. In these circumstances, it is recommended that there should be threepermanent British Technical Advisers to the Supreme War Council, one from each of the three Services. Individually each of these Officers would besubordinate to his own Service Chief in London; collectively they would besubordinate to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee. The effect of this arrange-ment would be that the British technical advisers to the Supreme War council would have a status corresponding to that of the Deputy Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee. They would, however, have their Office in whatever place may be selected for the meetings of the Supreme War Council; and they would be specifically charged with ensuring, by close and continuous co-operation with theFrench, and other allied representatives, that the War effort of the Allies on allfronts is systematically co-ordinated.34. It is suggested that, if the above arrangements are accepted in principle,the Chiefs of Staff should be requested to work out the details.35. This Paper deals with the Supreme War Council from the point of viewof strategic direction of the war. It is clear, however, that other inter-Alliedbodies would be brought into being to advise on shipping, supply matters, andother essential factors in our war effort, on the lines of the various bodies whichadvised the Supreme War Council in the last War. In effect, these bodies would develop naturally out of the contacts which have already been established withthe French in a number of fields.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,July 3, 1939.(Initialled) C.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1939.SECRET. Copy No.   49It is requested, that special care^may be taken toensupe the secrecy of this document.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of. the 364?A Meeting, held on July 6, 1939.rf:;t:^v:jlf&apos;y.    (3) SUPREME CONTROL IN WAS.(C.I.D. Paper No. D.P. (P.) 64.)(Previous reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 355th Meeting, Minute (5).)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence on Supreme Control in War (C.I.D. PaperNO, D.P. (P.) 64).LORD CHATFIELD said that the Committee, at their Meeting on the2nd May, 1939, had invited him, in consultation with the Service Ministers, toprepare a Memorandum on the Supreme Control of. the War by the AlliedGovernments. Part II of the Memorandum was an historical survey of thearrangements for inter-allied control, which were made during the last war.Part HI contained a number of recommendations. These were briefly asfollows : -(a) There should be a single Supreme War Council on which all the AlliedPowers should be represented (paragraph 21).(b) The Supreme War Council should meet either in France or England,preferably in England (paragraphs 22-24).(c) France and England should each be represented on the Council by theirPrime Ministers and one other Minister (paragraph 25).id) Owing to difficulties of communication, other members of the coalitionmight be represented by their Ambassadors; this arrangement shouldbe discussed with, the Governments concerned after agreement hasbeen reached with the French (paragraph 26).(e) The Supreme War Council should have no executive authority, final decisions being a matter for the Allied Governments (paragraph 27).(/) If it was agreed that the Council would meet in London, there would bea strong case for the despatch of Franco-British Missions to theEastern Fronts at the outset of hostilities (paragraphs 28 and 29).(g) The Supreme War Council should have permanent Military Representa-tives from each of the Powers represented thereon. These representa-tives would work as a joint Staff and would be subordinate to theSupreme Naval, Military and Air authorities of their respective countries (paragraphs 30 and 31).(h) In the case of Great Britain, there should be three technical advisers to the Supreme War  Council, one from each of  the Services(paragraphs 32 and 33).[19597-3]
(i) If the arrangements suggested in (g) and (h) above were accepted inprinciple, the Chiefs of Staff should be requested to work out thedetails of the Staffs which the technical advisers would require(paragraph 34).(;&apos;) Other Allied bodies would be brought into being to advise on shipping,supply matters, and so forth, as on the lines of the last war (paragraph 35).If these recommendations were approved, the question arose of whether, andif so when, we should inform the French, and whether it was desirable to set up an Inter-Allied Council forthwith, even if only in skeleton form. With regard tothe position of the Technical Advisers to the Supreme War Council, it was contemplated that their status would correspond to that of the Deputy Chiefs ofStaff.Mr. HORE-BELISHA said that our position was rather different from thatof the French, who had General Gamelin, who was not only Chief of Staff of all three Services/but also the Commander of the French Army in the field. Hethought that representation on the Supreme War Council should be kept fluid onthe lines of that of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and that it should be leftto the Prime Minister of the day to have with him whatever Ministers or Advisersseemed to him most appropriate, having regard to the particular business beforethe Council. He suggested that consideration should be given to the desirabilityof establishing the Council forthwith and of setting up Inter-Allied bodies toadvise on shipping, supply matters, &amp;c.SIR CYRIL NEWALL suggested that the three Chiefs of Staff should bethe permanent technical representatives to the War Council, their places beingtaken by deputies when they were themselves unable to attend.LORD CHATFIELD pointed out that the Supreme War Council wouldrequire whole-time technical advisers and it would therefore be impossible forthe work to be carried out by the Chiefs of Staff themselves.SIR CYRIL NEWALL agreed. He suggested that deputies should be in permanent session, the Chiefs of Staff only attending for urgent and exceptionallyimportant matters.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the technical advisers wouldnot be members of the Council. The technical representatives of each of thecountries concerned would be responsible for giving collective advice to theCouncil.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD suggested that in principle the Chiefs of staff should be permanent members of the Advisory Panel, as they were ultimatelyresponsible for the advice given by the British representatives.LORD GORT suggested that, when decisions on major matters were required, the Prime Minister should take the Chiefs of Staff as his technical advisers, the day-to-day detailed work being carried out by deputies.LORD HALIFAX agreed.Mr, HORE-BELISHA suggested that the Prime Minister might write toM. Daladier to inform him of our ideas and suggest that if he agreed in principle,steps should be taken to work out the Franco-British organisation that would berequired.Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed :  (a) To approve in principle the proposed arrangements for inter-allied control in a future war, as outlined in Part 3 of C.I.D. PaperNo. D.P. (P.) 64, namely-(i) There should be a single Supreme War Council on which all allied Powers should be represented (paragraph 21).(ii) The Supreme War Council should meet either in France orEngland, preferably in England (paragraphs 22-24).
(iii) France and England should each be represented on the council by their Prime Ministers and one other Minister (para-graph 25). (In this connection it was thought that the position should be kept fluid, and that both Prime Ministers should bein a position to take with them to Council meetings suchMinisters and advisers as they require, having regard to thebusiness on the Agenda.)(iv) Owing to difficulties of communication, other members of the coalition might be represented by their Ambassadors; thisarrangement should be discussed with the Governments con-cernect after agreement has been reached with the French(paragraph 26).(v) The Supreme War Council should have no executive authority,final decisions being a matter for the Allied Governments(paragraph 27).(vi) If it was agreed that the Council would meet in London, therewould be a strong case for the despatch of Franco-BritishMissions to the Eastern fronts at the outset of hostilities(paragraphs 28 and 29).(vii) The Supreme War Council should have permanent military representatives from each of the Powers represented thereon.These representatives would work as a Joint Staff and wouldbe subordinate to the Supreme Naval, Military and Airauthorities of their respective countries (paragraphs 30and 31).  -(viii) In the case of Great Britain, there should be three technical advisers to the Supreme War Council, one from each of theServices. Individually each of these Officers would besubordinate to his own Service Chief : collectively they wouldbe subordinate to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (para-graphs 32 and 33). (In this connection it was agreed that oneor more of the Chiefs of Staff themselves should attend meetings of the Supreme War Council, if the Prime Minister. so desired (see (iii) above).)(ix) In addition to the arrangements for providing the Supreme WarCouncil with advice on strategic matters (see (vii) and (viii)above), it would be necessary to set up other Inter-Allied bodiesto advise on shipping, supply matters and other essentialelements of the allied war effort.(b) To invite the Prime Minister to communicate the above proposals toM. Daladier, and suggest that, if they are acceptable to him, steps might be taken forthwith to work out the Organisation that would berequired.-(c) To request the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee to work out the details ofthe Staff which would be required for the three technical advisers(see (a), (vii) and (viii) above).* * * * * *Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,July 6, 1939.
