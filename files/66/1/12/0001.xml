Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1939.SECSET.W.P. (39) 12.i that special care&apos; may be, taken tobe secrecy 6i this document.WAR CABINET.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith a note which has been prepared in the Foreign Office on the use of the Straits and on the means of communi-cation through Roumania to Poland.&apos; H.C/^/ziAv, hsm A    1 OQQCopy No.13NOTE ON THE USE OF THE STRAITS.IF the treaty of alliance with Turkey enters into force in the form at presentproposed, Turkey will be under no consequent obligation to enter the war againstGermany on the side of Great Britain and France.2. The only immediate obligation which Turkey will incur will be to&quot; consult&quot; with Great Britain and France about the situation which has arisenowing to the outbreak of the war.3. In fact, unless the war spread to the Mediterranean area, the onlycontingency which would oblige Turkey to enter the war would be an attack uponRournania, which brought the British and French guarantees to Roumania intooperation. It would not be sufficient that Roumania should, without being attacked, enter the war on the side of Great Britain and France.4\ So long as Turkey is not at war with any other Power, she has not onlythe right but the obligation under the Montreux Convention to prevent the war-ships of belligerent Powers from passing through the Straits. &quot; Warships &quot; forall practical purposes includes ships carrying troops.5. On the other hand, Turkey is under an obligation to allow merchant ships,whether belligerent or non-belligerent, to pass the Straits with any sort of cargo,including munitions of war.6. So long, therefore, as Turkey is neutral, Great Britain and France couldonly send help to Poland through the Straits in the form of material. They couldnot send troops; and they could not send warships for the purpose, for example,of intercepting ships carrying supplies destined for Germany from the soviet union to Roumanian or Bulgarian ports.7. It might be possible, in the course of &quot; consultation,&quot; to ask Turkey to close her eyes to certain breaches of the Montreux Convention, e.g., the passage ofBritish submarines into the Black Sea. But she could not comply withoutexposing herself to a charge of unneutral conduct by Germany and to the risk ofa decision by Germany to treat her as an enemy. If she were willing to do this,she would probably be willing to enter the war anyhow.10543   [19938]
8. If the material which Great Britain and France could legitimately sendthrough the Straits were able to reach a Roumanian port, it could, in accordancewith Article 7 of Hague Convention No. 7, then: pass through Roumania to Polandwithout involving anylbreach of Roumanian neutrality, provided the action takendid not amount to &quot; moving a convoy &quot; across Roumanian territory (Article 2 ofthe same Convention).9. As regards communications between Roumania and Poland, it wouldappear that there is one railway line as far as Cernowitz, which before reaching the border divides and crosses the frontier as follows : (1) A line northwards to Tarnopol,(2) A line westwards via Sniatyn to Kolomea,(3) A loopline westwards via Horodenka to Kolomea.This would appear to constitute the only direct railway communication between poland and Roumania, although it will be seen that there is also a line from roumania to Poland which crosses Hungarian territory. All the lines in questionnaire single.10.&quot; There are three roads from Cernowitz across the frontier correspondingroughly to the direction of the railway. They are thought to be capable of takingtwo lines of traffic, but it is believed that their surface condition is poor andwould not stand up to continuous heavy traffic.11. His Majesty&apos;s Legation is being asked to furnish immediately as full areport as possible on the present state of communications between Roumania and poland.Foreign Office, September 5, 1939.
