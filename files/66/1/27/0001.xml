99 9CYPHER TELEGRAM.NEW ZEALANDProm the Government of New Zealand.Dated 13th September, 1939, received 6.20 p.m. on 12thSeptember, 1939.IMMEDIATE.No. 14YfflMost Secret.After having had an opportunity, which they havewarmly appreciated, of perusing your Most Secret telegramof the 8th September to the High Commissioner for the UnitedKingdom in New Zealand, His Majesty&apos;s Government in NewZealand have the following observations to offer on the course which they propose to take to enable them to play their full part in the war.NAVY.1. They note with appreciation that H.M.S. Leanderwill be retained on this station and on her return fromPanning Island on the 13th September she will be ready totake up her duties before the end of this week.2. It is believed that very few trained naval reservessurplus to New Zealand requirements could be made availablefor the Royal Navy.     Steps are being taken immediately toascertain the number which is not expected to exceed 50 or 60.3. It is considered that no trained civil pilotscould be made available for service in the Fleet Air Arm, theservices of such personnel being required here to facilitate the programme referred to by you under heading Air Force.4. Enquiries are being made for yachtsmen and ex-mercantile officers suitable for R.N.V.R.  commissions.-1-

It is anticipated that a substantial number could be madeavailable and a further communication on this subject willbe sent in due course,5o Enquiries are being made as to telegraphists andsignalmen, artificers, scientists (electrical and wireless telegraphy) and skilled electrical workmen and the numberavailable for surplus to local requirements will be notified to you in due course.    It is not considered that many willbe available but enquiries are being made as to the possibili-ties of increasing the number of such trained personnel.60 His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand accept theresponsibility for fitting out and manning one armed merchant cruiser, the provision of a second ship being left for subsequent consideration, and they propose that theyshould assume liability for the Monowai when the necessary instructions have been received from the Admiralty.7&amp; His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand accept responsibility for equipping ships as fast liners anddefensively equipped merchant ships0    They take it that their responsibility will be limited to equipping these ships asthey become available here and providing gun crews.    Aninstructional staff for this purpose is already provided atAuckland and it is not considered, in the meantime at anyrate, that an instructional staff at any other port wouldbe advantageous.8. Enquiries are being made as to the possibility ofbuilding ?whale-catchers and trawlers result of which willbe communicated to you later.    A few existing boats whichare now being inspected may be available but is not felt that local facilities will be adequate for any material productionunder this head.

ARMY.i, Steps already being taken as indicated in my telegram No. 138 of the 9th September are entirelyappropriate as preliminary steps to meet the position under either of alternative hypotheses (a) and (b) in theSecretary of State&apos;s telegram to the High Commissioner.The training of the first volunteers will commence on 3rd October next.2. It is proposed to call up a second echelon con-sisting of 5?GOO officers and men at the expiration oftwo months from the beginning of the training of the firstechelon and a third echelon of 59000 two months after thebeginning of the training of the second echelon,that isfour months after the beginning of the training of thefirst echelon.      This will complete the personnel (Officersand other ranks) for one infantry division.3. Under hypothesis (a) it is considered, that subjectto the receipt of adequate equipment for training inmechanised warfare (or alternatively subject to anopportunity being afforded for such training after departure from New Zealand) and provided always of course that safeand adequate. means of transport is available,,  that a fullytrained division could leave the Dominion for service in france,  or any theatre of r:ar which at the time might be indicated as more appropriate, within a period of eight months from to-day.h. Within the limits specified in paragraph (3)* troopssufficiently trained for garrison duty could be madeavailable within a period of two months from to-day up to a strength of 6,000 within four months up to a strength of11,000 and within six months up to a strength of 16,000.

5. The question whether troops under training should beheld in this Dominion until a full division is availablefor active service in a theatre of war or whether in themeantime or alternatively troops should be despatched forthe relief of the United Kingdom units e.go in Singapore,Burma or India, as and when brigades become available, is amatter which His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand proposeto consider in the light of the circumstances as they arise and of any views or advice which they would be grateful toreceive from time to time from His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom.60 His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand will take an early opportunity of pointing out the inadvisabilityof individuals attempting to proceed to the United kingdom with a view to enlisting in the infantry or artillery and willtake immediate steps to ascertain the number of technical personnel particularly electricians, mechanical workmen,mechanics, motor transport drivers also officers with similarqualifications and medical officers who are surplus tonecessary requirements here and available for service in theUnited Kingdom.     Further communications on this matter willbe forwarded in due course.7. Under hypothesis (b)  the New Zealand Governmentwill be guided by circumstances and by the advice of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, and withinthe limits of the programme laid down they will holdformations ready at short notice for reinforcement of singapore, Fiji and the British and French islands in thesouth-western Pacific.AIR FORCE.1. Every possible step will be taken to press on with the agreed training scheme.      It is noted that His

Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will supplyaircraft as soon as possible and in the meantime every possible use will be made of the civil aviation reservesavailable here as and when those reserves can be brought into effective use29 His Majesty1s Government in New Zealandare very grateful for the helpful and careful reasonedappreciation of the steps which they might take as set out inthe Secretary of State&apos;s telegram to the High commissioner and they will at no time fail to make every possible effort to comply v/ith the suggestions contained in that telegramand with any further suggestions that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom may make in the future.
