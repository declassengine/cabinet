If the War Cabinet approve generally the lines ofthis appreciation, I would propose to convey its substance to the FrenchGovernment.The warning to the French Government, envisaged in the Cabinet conclusionsquoted above, requesting them not to encourage action in the Balkans until italy had made clear her intentions, was duly despatched, and the French Governmenthave now informed us that our views will be carefully considered. The FrenchGovernment have also, at our instance, promised that no attempt will be made to induce Roumania to abandon her neutrality without previous consultation withHis Majesty&apos;s Government.Foreign Office,September 12, 1939.THE Balkan situation to-day, while complicated in detail, is in essencecomparatively simple.The countries concerned are :  Hungary (though it is not usually considered part of the Balkans).Ruumania.&apos; , Yugoslavia.Greece.Bulgaria and turkey (whose main interests and territory, of course, lie. outside the balkans).2.   Of these countries Hungary and Bulgaria are unsatisfied that is to say,they have territorial claims against the other Balkan countries.  These claims areas follows : Hungary claims Transylvania from Roumania; Bulgaria claims theDobruja from Roumania, a territorial outlet on the iEgean from Greece, and10552   [19964] b
&quot; Macedonia &quot; from Yugoslavia,. The remaining four are satisfied inter se; but while these countries have no territorial claims against each other, Greece and turkey both harbour revisionist claims against Italy in the Dodecanese.3. There have always been two main characteristics of the Balkanposition : (a) Fear of outside Powers;(b) Mutual suspicion.Fear of Outside Powers.4. AIL these six countries; with the possible exception of Turkey, are, andhave been for some time, terrified of Germany. This fear dates, in its presentphase, from the advent of the Nazi Party to power in the Reich (1933); it has beenaccentuated since the German occupation of Austria and still more of Czecho-Slovakia. For the past two years these countries have all been looking towardsGreat Britain and France to help them to escape economic, and thereforeultimately political, domination by Germany. Some help has been forthcoming,but not sufficient to achieve their purpose or our own. The minds of the balkan countries are now divided between their fears of offending Germany and theirpassionate desire to maintain their independence.5. While the main fear is of Germany, Greece and Yugoslavia in particularare profoundly mistrustful of Italy, for Italy is suspected of territorial ambitionsat their expense, e.g., in the Adriatic region in the case of Yugoslavia, and Creteand Corfu in the case of Greece. These suspicions have, of course, multipliedsince the occupation of Albania by Italy last Easter.6. For her part Turkey is anxious on general grounds lest Italy shall become the predominant Power in the Mediterranean. If any Power is to occupy adominant position in that area, Turkey would prefer that it should be one with more disinterested motives, eg., ourselves or even France.Mutual Suspicions.7. It is a truism that in the Balkans no country or individual trusts anyother. If, however, one country can be said to be more mistrusted than any otherit is Bulgaria. This is due in the first place to Bulgaria&apos;s revisionist aims, andin the second to Bulgaria&apos;s record in the Balkan wars, when she stabbed herformer friends in the back. Her behaviour on that occasion has neither beenforgotten nor forgiven.Combinations in the Balkans.8. There are two organisations in the Balkans : one enjoying reasonablestrength and vigour, the other a mere rump. The first, the Balkan Entente, datingfrom 1934, is composed of the three satisfied Powers, Roumania, Yugoslavia and greece, together with Turkey, and was formed for the purpose of maintaining thestatus quo in the Balkans in general (i.e., to prevent the Great Powers from making the Balkans their playground) and, in particular, of resisting any attempt by Bulgaria to modify the existing Balkan situation in her favour. It will beseen, therefore, that from a purely Balkan point of view the Entente was designedto keep Bulgaria where she is.9. The second organisation, the Little Entente, was formed in 1926, and wascomposed of Czecho-Slovakia, Yugoslavia and Roumania. Its main object was, sofar as Central and South-East Europe were concerned, to ensure that a dissatisfiedand dismembered Hungary should be in no position to challenge the well-being of the three most important Succession States. Owing to the disappearance ofCzeqho-Slovakia, the Little Entente now exists only in the attenuated, form of atreaty of alliance between Yugoslavia and Roumania (directed against Hungary).Developments in 1939.10. The present year has seen various efforts to solidify and stabilise theposition generally in these regions.
11. Yugoslavia, placed as she is in the most disadvantageous position of anyof these countries, with Germany on the north, Italy on the west and south, and anequivocal Bulgaria on the east, has lately shown that she is anxious both toimprove relations between herself and Bulgaria, and to do what she can tofacilitate a detente between Roumania, with whom, as we have seen, she stands in special relations, and Hungary. It is difficult to say what success has attendedher efforts so far as Bulgaria is concerned, but a treaty of perpetual friendshipalready exists between the two countries (January 1937), and it is certainly truethat Bulgaro-Yugoslav relations are more cordial than are the relations betweenBulgaria and either Roumania or Greece. We have reason to believe that Italy has been taking some interest in this Yugoslav-Bulgarian rapprochement, and itmay be that she is attempting to fortify her position in the Balkans against possible German encroachment. On the other hand, Yugoslavia has not daredto align herself with Great Britain and France for fear of drawing the wrathof Germany and Italy upon herself. She has tried to balance on the tight-ropeof friendship with all. Thus, she has never asked for a guarantee from HisMajesty&apos;s Government, and would not welcome it if it were offered.12. His Majesty&apos;s Government, on their side, realising the importance ofconsolidating the Balkans so far as possible, have done what they safely could toencourage the entry of Bulgaria into the Balkan Entente, or at least to ensurethat Bulgaria&apos;s policy shall not be in disharmony with that of the Entente as awhole. To this end, notably during the visit to this country of the roumanian minister for Foreign Affairs in April last, we hinted that, if Roumania wouldbe prepared to consider the cession of the Southern Dobrudja to Bulgaria, weshould have no objection. We renewed our efforts later, through the medium ofthe Turkish Government, during the visit of M. Gafencu to Angora, in June, but any hopes. we may have had were wrecked by the attitude of the BulgarianMinister at Angora, who, conceivably under German influence, made it clear thatan essential prerequisite of any entry of Bulgaria into the Entente was thesettlement in full of all Bulgaria&apos;s claims. In the earlier stages it was the policyof the Turkish Government to bring Bulgarian policy into line with that of the balkan Entente, but her efforts have been unsuccessful and have now been abandoned.13. Since then there have been rumours of the possibility of a joint declara-tion of neutrality by Roumania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Hungary, or, in otherversions, by the first three of these countries. These rumours have not been confirmed.14. Mention must also be made of difficulties which have arisen in the lastmonth or so between Bulgaria and Turkey, due to the latter&apos;s concentration oftroops in the neighbourhood of the Bulgarian frontier. The presence of these troops has caused grave suspicion in Sofia. In consequence, it seems very doubtfulwhether, in the absence of a previous detente between Bulgaria and Turkey, itwould at present be possible to bring Bulgaria into any sort of line with the balkan Entente&apos;.15. Finally, it should be added that there has recently been a recrudescenceof suspicion between Hungary and Roumania based ostensibly oh mobilizationmeasures and the treatment of minorities in the latter country, but in i&apos;eality dueto the former&apos;s territorial pretensions.Present Position.16. So much for the background. At the end of the first week of war theposition of these countries may be summarised as follows :-17. Hungary. Officially, the attitude of this country remains equivocal,although we have learnt from the Hungarian Minister here, unofficially, that shedesires to maintain her neutrality. Hungary is, however, in the German orbit, andthere is a wide gap between her desire to maintain her neutrality and her ability todo so iii the face of German threats and blandishments! Moreover, she is exposed[19964] b 2
to the constant temptation of attempting to settle with German aid her claims against Roumania. On the other hand she has for many years been on friendlyterms with Poland.18. &quot; Roumania, who, on the 13th April, received a guarantee against aggression from His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government providedshe herself resists, officially declared her neutrality on the 5th, September. her position is an unenviable one as she is surrounded by three countries all of whom have territorial claims against her, viz., Russia in respect of Bessarabia, Hungaryin respect of Transylvania, and Bulgaria in respect of the Dobrudja. Further,she is the possessor of oil fields the product of which is essential to germany in the prosecution of the war. Roumania is, however, determined to yield none of her existing territory and she has let it be known that she will resist attack.To what extent she is capable of effective resistance is another question.19. Yugoslavia officially declared her neutrality on the 5th September. she has been greatly strengthened internally by the recent agreement reached betweenthe Serbs and the Croats (the 25th August last) and the bulk of public opinion in. the country is pro-ally. It may be taken as certain that Yugoslavia will notfight against us, but this does not mean that there is any prospect in the nearfuture of inducing her to abandon her neutrality. She has nothing to gain froma war and a great deal to lose. Meanwhile, Germany has an eye on her mineralproducts. The direction of affairs is largely in the hands of the Prince Regent,who is a convinced Anglophil and intensely suspicious of Italy.20. Greece, who also received on the 13th April a guarantee against aggression from His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government if sheherself resists, has not officially announced her attitude in the present conflict.The main factor in her foreign policy is her fear of Italy, and the occupation of albania, which was considered to be the first step in an Italian drive towardsSalonika, has redoubled these fears. Distrust of Italy has encouraged a closerapprochement with Turkey, and Staff talks with the latter country are under-stood to be in progress. But here again Greece could hardly be expected to put up any effective resistance against either Italian or German attack.21. Bulgaria has made no official announcement of her attitude. She wouldlike to remain neutral and avoid being overrun, but at the same time she isdesperately anxious to realise her territorial ambitions. She came in on the wrong side, in the last war and does not wish to make the same mistake again.The Germans are making a great drive in the country, are supplying her wdtharms and seem likely shortly to send a military mission to Sofia. In recent monthsour main object in Bulgaria has been to induce in that country a belief that HisMajesty&apos;s Government cannot lose a war, but it is by no means certain that wehave succeeded. Owing to her geographical position, Bulgaria is, strategically,the key to the Balkan problem.*22. Turkey has not announced her attitude towards the present conflict,but the German Ambassador in Angora has been informed that it would beabsurd to expect Turkey to make an official declaration of neutrality. Underthe Declaration of the 12th May last Turkey is our ally if Italycomes into the war against us. Under the treaty, which we hope shortly to sign with her, she will also fight on our side if we implement ourguarantees either to Roumania or Greece. For the rest (and havingregard to the way in which the war has now broken out) the treaty provides inall other cases for consultation. But the negotiations for this treaty are provingvery protracted and the Turkish Governments attitude is unsatisfactory. On thebest interpretation she is refusing to sign until her economic and financialdemands have been satisfied. On the worst, she may be playing a double, game :in the case of. Russia she appears &quot;to be negotiating what looks very like a mutual guarantee treaty, which in certain circumstances might not suit our book. It mustbe remembered that Turkey&apos;s primary and over-riding reason in undertakingcollaboration with His Majesty&apos;s Government is her fear of Italian ambitions inthe Mediterranean. She will not thank us for attempting to drag her into a conflict if Italy is neutral; still less if Italy were to be friendly.* It is for this reason that Turkey and her allies in the Balkan Entente appear to have been considering plans for facing Bulgaria with an ultimatum openly to declare her attitude underthreat of immediate occupation should the war reach the Mediterranean or Balkan area.
The Future.23. The Balkan position is, therefore, very unstable. : There is a danger that, given the chance, the two unsatisfied Powers will attack the satisfied. Is it:now,&apos; or is it likely to be later, in our best interests to set a match to this area I Atthe best we could hope for Roumania, Greece and Turkey (and very improbably, atany rate for a long time to come, Yugoslavia) on our side, with.Hungary and bulgaria as very probable enemies. At the worst we might add the last twocountries to the list of our enemies, while only obtaining as our ally Roumania,whose powers of resistance are more than doubtful. Turkey might well standaloof since she is only pledged (under the Anglo-Turkish declaration) to come in if italy is at war with us, and even if the proposed treaty is signed she will only be bound to come in if Germany attacks Roumania, not if Roumania declares war on germany.   Much depends, from every point of view, on the attitude of Italy.24 On general strategical grounds it has already been decided that it isin our best interests, certainly at present, to keep Italy neutral. What effect would intervention in the Balkans be likely to have on the prospects of Italianneutrality ?   And on our hopes of eventually drawing Italy in on our side&apos;?25. In the last resort the attitude of Italy will depend upon two factors :(a) the military position and chances of victory of the allies, and (6) public opinion in Italy itself. This public opinion is predisposed to dislike the German con-nexion and would only sanction a war against England and France with thegreatest reluctance. That reluctance could only be overcome if it seemed clearthat Germany was going to win. It follows that, in this connexion, the military position of the allies is of first-class importance.26. It is for the Chiefs of Staff to say whether, if we attempt to enlist theassistance of Balkan Powers, that military position is likely to improve or not. a paper on Balkan neutrality, dated 9th September (CCS. (39) 15) lays downclearly that in the view of the Chiefs of Staff, given a choice between (a) a neutralBalkan Entente so long as Italy also remains neutral, and (b) Turkey, Greece andBoumania as belligerents on our side but Italy hostile,Mhey would, from a military point of view, much prefer (a). They reached this conclusion partly for thereasons contained in Rome telegram No. 795, of which a copy is attached toC.O.S. (39) 15, and partly because it is in their opinion desirable to restrict theactual area of military operations, at least until such time as the resources ofour Empire have been more fully mobilised. It may be inferred from the reasonsquoted that the Chiefs of Staff do not believe that, for the present, our interven-tion in the Balkans would improve our military position. There is presumablya risk that it might cause a deterioration, at any rate in the initial stages. if so, this would in itself increase the chances of Italy abandoning neutrality infavour of Germany, and this we wish to avoid.27. Again, our intervention in the Balkans in present circumstances, suchas an expedition to Salonika, an idea which General Weygand seems to have beentoying with, would almost certainly involve the violation of Greek and perhapsTurkish neutrality, for it would be impossible to compel either Greece or turkey to go to war unless and until Italy was in the war against us. In a word, wecannot at one and the same time pursue a policy of keeping Italy neutral and thepolicy of mobilising the Balkan States against Germany.Conclusion.28. In view of the above it is clear that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should be directed, so long as Italy remains neutral, and so long as we attachparamount importance to that neutrality, towards ensuring, so far as may bepossible, the formation of a neutral bloc in the Balkans. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have already made enquiries at Budapest, Bucharest, Belgrade and Sofiawith a view to ascertaining if there is any action they can usefully take in furtherance of this proposal.German Attitude.29. No account has been taken in this paper of the probable attitude ofGermany towards the Balkan countries.   It is known, of course, that Germany
will be in need of supplies of oil from Roumania, and it seems probable toothat she will wish to obtain certain minerals from Yugoslavia. In addition, thereare a wide range of products, agricultural and otherwise, that she will wish todraw from these countries. There have been indications that Germany may have prepared certain plans for the Balkans, based on the prospect of a neutral Italy.With Italy neutral it seems possible that Germany may be anxious to restrict the area of conflict, and to leave the Balkan countries untouched with a viewto drawing from them the supplies she needs. She may, indeed, have given a pledge to this effect to the Soviet Government and may be offering a similarbribe to Turkey.30. It may be argued that it would be foolish to allow the Germans to carryout this plan. On the other hand, without going into all the economic questions involved-and they are intricate and fall to be dealt with by the Ministerfor Economic Warfare it is probable that if we were successful in embroilingthese countries with Germany, and they were in consequence to be overrun byGermany, the Germans might well be in a position to obtain more from countriescompletely subjugated than they would from countries still officially neutral.31. The German Government may, indeed, reach this conclusionindependently and take action against, e.g., Roumania. But, unless they do, itwould seem plain that it is not to our interest to weaken the forces working for Balkan neutrality. A neutral, and, a fortiori, a friendly, Italy seems more valuable to us than a Balkans forced by us into belligerency. And the two are almost certainly incompatible.
