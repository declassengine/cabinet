At 0130 hours 20th &quot;was invitedvisit front starting at 0500.      Travelled by car.     wanted to take Collier,     Was not allowed to take R.A.P. Officer.Took Greer.     Y/as met at Vyasma by Colonel representingTimoshenko. Wont on along Smolensk road as far as bridge.   over Dnieper,      Turned North off main road and after detourof about 11C 110 kilometres reached Headquarters 50thDivision of 19th Army at the V in River Vop in 1 over300,000 Russian map Zakaz 40-237 published 25th Nov. 1940copies of which you have had from Military Attache.(Continued) The Division had taken part in anattack on the 19th in which it had forced the passageof the Vop and had&apos; advanced about 15 (or 18) kilometreson a front of 5 Axis of attack was due V/est.     attack was still proceding having been renewed, at 1300 hours20th with limited further objective.     It took ten hours to reach Division.      Timoshenko had ordered that I mustbe clear of forward Area by dark so only got threehours with Division.     Very heavy rain started at 1800converting forest   roads into marmalade.     Bogged.Benighted.     Took 21 hours on return trip hence delay in report.     Major impressions in part two followingimmediately.     Details in part three by less immediate.Make allowance where necessary for fact that I wassham a good sbpw diriig successful action.   General impression of all I saw on outward and return trips as well as withDivision was good.     Division had had hard fight onpreceding day.      It had captured at least 4 Gorman FieldBatteries thre;j of which I saw.      Clearing of battlefieldmethodical and quick.     Most dead already buried but samples&apos;of Germans left for me to see.      Co-operation of tanks and air with other Arms close and effective.      Morale highwith universal hatred of Fascisti which is term by whichGermans are always known.     Relations between all ranks&apos;excellent^,     Russian Air Force operating with theRussian Army is allotted to Armies.      It is onlysuballotted to Corps and Divisions for specificoperations but Air Force Staff Officer is permanentlyOn Divisional Staff.      (Continued)..Part Two.1

1     &apos; i    -d161Part two.1st continuation.Saw several German Stukas operating againstRussian advanced elements.    Also several sorties Russianmedium bombers in flights of about six with objectives in rear of battlefield.      Considerable Air activity tautsaw no actual combats numbers of German and russian aircraft seen operating in area about equal0      Russiansstated Germans had been reinforced in the air since first day of Russian attack..      Battlefield like Salisbury Plainbut with a great deal of thick scrub some &quot;ten feet high.Russians most adept at concealment,      A good-deal ofsporadic shelling both sides during my visit.    Russiansvery steady under shell fire and very good at takingcover or freezing when enemy aircraft appear.      Wastaken round by Divisional Headquarters Commissar asDivisional Commander naturally occupied with his battlewas not allowed in forward 0.P,  area as Divisional-Commander had been told that he would be liquidated ifI got into trouble.      Inspected one medium howitzerBattery in action,      Entire layout was normal and appeared to be functioning smoothly and efficiently.Part two..Second Continuation,Could not get precise information but I thinkthat South of Road Smolensk-Vyasma Germans are considerably further East than North of it*      Wegathered from conversations that a Russian attack toretake Smolensk from North-East may be made very shortly.      Very considerable motor transport activity on road Moscow-Smolensk as far as Dnieper Bridge and onour route to the River Vop,      DrivingP road discipline and traffic control were all good.      Proportion ofbreakdowns or cases of ditching seemed abnormallylow,      Saw no accidents.     Apart from a few InfantryUnits saw no reinforcements moving up but several woodswere full of very well concealed troops nature of whichwe could not determine.      Several individual tanks and support weapons seen going up presumably as replace-ments,      Saw one railway train carrying 23 medium tankssteaming West from Moscow,      There can be no acute tankshortage in this area as in addition to divisionaltank battalions operating with right forward battalionI saw at least one unit of some 20 medium tanks hiddenin reserve in battery position area.Part Two.Third Continuation.Germans have not yet bombed Moscow-Smolensk RoadEast of Dnieper Bridge anywhere except at Bridge overrailway North of Vyasma.     Large numbers near misseswith big bombs all round this but so far no hits,,Vyasma has been heavily bombed,     Russian daytime trafficdensity surprisingly high.     Normally 50 to 40 V,TC.M,I estimated normal M.P.H. to be 20 on main roads and 8to 10 on others Russian troops obviously well fed and fit,.

Horses small wiry and hard.     Supply arrangements seemedto be working well.     Battle in progress but fieldcookers all pulling out in orderly manner to go up afterdark as I was leaving.     No sign of a single refugeefrom start to- finish of my trip.     Work on harvestproceeding vigorously by inhabitants right up into rear of battery position area.     A lot of it is already in*Part Two.Fourth Continuation.Proportion of duds among German artillery shellsvery high.     Divisional Commander put it at as much as50%.      My own estimate- after 3 hours of it was atleast 25%.     Russians also state German aircraft havebeen dropping bags of stones and bits of scrap owingpresumably to shortage of bombs.     This division confirmsmy previous reports that German close support byinfantry guns mortars and dive bombers is excellent andthe biggest menace the Russians Infantry have to face.On this front the Germans have several times brigadedtheir medium mortars and used them for a quick burst of concentrated fire, moving them to a fresh positiondirectly afterwards.     Much the same tactics as we use for our Livens projectors.     The Divisional Gommanderdescribed this procedure as quote panic making unquote.This is significant as I think this is one respect inwhich the Russians are apt to fail.     Under violentsurprise especially in some novel guise they are given toherd panic.     Much of the above is most satisfactoryinformation from our point of view.      I repeat myopening caveat, but it can hardly apply outside the divisional area with the short notice of my visit. Part3 follows.Part Three.1. Russian defences in depth.      I cannot say how orhow far the Defence Works I saw on each side of roadMoscow-Smolensk extend.      The main ones were as follows.(a) At kilometer 282 from Moscow.,    Strong linealong River Dnieper.     River itself backed by very goodwater anti tank obstacle dug in marshy ground.     About30 feet of strong wire behind this.      Trenches andweapon pits and a little concrete under construction,(b) At kilometer 276 from Moscow.      Good antitank obstacle with weapon pits and trenches.     As yet no wire.(c) About kilometer 230 from Moscow,     As in (b).I think Vyasma is included as strong locality in this line.      I saw Commander of the Army Artillery doing a reconnaissance of this line.(d) At kilometer 174.(e) About kilometer 120.(f) About kilometer 60.      In the,se three work isas in (b) and (c) but little has been done beyond antitank obstacle in case of (e) and (f)  all anti tankobstacles look adequate-.     Both faces are vertical and minimum depth of about 6 to 8 feet.     No revetting assoil stands well.-&apos;&apos;&quot;--  I saw no trace of mines but could

get no information on this.    Russians use tree trunks inthe same way as we uso plain iron rails.     There aro normallynot. more than three or four rows.      Tree trunks arominimum diameter of about 10 inches and maximum up to15 inches.      They aro either set in the ground, verticallyor are inclined towards enemy at about 60 degrees withground.2. Relations with party.      The Divisional Commissarwho took me round obviously had authority Over all ranks0He was most (?voluble) but was clearly on excellent terms with everyone and we were told he was generally in the forefront of the battle.      My personal G-.P.U. Escort camewith me and got a very friendly reception everywhere.G-reer and I finished up as Tovarishes instead of G-aspadins,3. Communications.      As far as I could see and ascertainboth wireless and line communications were ample and working well.     All batteries had both line and T/T to theirOps.4, Motor transport.      Rather a medly of types and a lot of it no longer young but functioning with obviousreliability.      The bulk of it is of about 30 cwt.standard.     A fair proportion of whole track or semi trackgeneral purpose vehicles.      No lights at all are allowed in the forward area which has considerable depttuBallisage would help enormously in the forests.     May i suggest it to them and can we provide any.5. Tanks.      Practically all the tanks we saw were oftype T26 which appears to be giving a very good accountof itself.i6. Horse transport.      Nearly all of standard central european two horse light four wheel type.      There appearsto be an almost unlimited supply.      This will be just aswell when the rains come if the affect of one nightsrain on the country roads can be gauged by our experiencelast night.7. The Divisional Commander was very pleased that oneHeavy A.A.  Battery had just been added to the Establishmentof his Division.&apos;8, Methods of fire.      I was not allowed, far enoughforward to see the close support weapons functioning.Artillery support during the period of my visit was nearlyentirely observed fire by salvos or bursts of gunfirewithout ranging.9. Ammunition.      I was very struck with the H.E.  shellfor the 152 m.m. Howitzer,     A beautifully finishedstreamlined job.      I also saw the cratering produced bythe Field Artillery bombardment of enemy bank of. theRiver Vop during the previous days attack.     The depth ofthis shoot on the River Bank was about 100 yards and ahigh density of shallow instantaneous fuze craters had resulted,10, Attack on battery positions by Russian Tanks. Inmost cases the Medium Tanks in the heat of the fight had actually run the guns down.      In one battery three 105 num.

i 3dguns had been treated in this way, the fourth had blownthe turret off a tank to pieces at about 10 yards rangebefore being captured.11.       German Field Artillery equipment.     All FieldBatteries captured were the standard 105 except one battery -of the 105L.F.H.  16.12.        Employment of women.     We found the RussianEquivalent of our A.T.S.   in standard Russian Uniformblouses dark blue skirts and feign boots,  attached toUnits as far forward as advanced Divisional H. Qe  asmedical assistants telegraphists motor drivers ctc013.        Commander 50th Russian Division.      DivisionalCommander was Colonel Boreyko.      Quite a number ofRussian Divisions are being commanded by Colonels,He appeared to be about 45 and was clearly a strongpersonality and a good Commander who knew his job andWas running a good show.      He said quite openly thathis Division were not bothering to take many prisoners^He also said, that when the Russians attacked they rarelygot to close quarters with a Gorman Officer.     the rear parties that they mopped up wore usually Commandedby junior N. C. 01 s.
