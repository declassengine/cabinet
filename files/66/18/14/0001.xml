THIS DOCUWfENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,Printed for the War Cabinet.   August 1941.MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (41) 191.August 11, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ITALIAN MORALE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum on the state of Italianmorale as revealed by recent reports received in this Department.The conclusion to be drawn from this memorandum is that apathy and war-weariness are the salient characteristics of the prevailing mood in Italy. chances of knocking Italy out of the war (i.e., forcing her to a separate peace) can now be discounted, since the Germans would certainly forestall any such move in Italyby converting the present moral occupation into a physical occupation of thecountry. But the more depressed and restless the Italians become the less effectiveis the Fascist Government&apos;s contribution to the German effort, and the greaterdo Germany&apos;s policing responsibilities in Italy become.The moral of this is that, even though we cannot now hope to knock Italyout, we should not relax efforts to hit metropolitan Italy by air and from the seawhenever opportunity offers.  Each blow against Italy is a blow against Germany.A. E.Foreign Office, August 11, 1941.(Most Secret.)ITALIAN MORALE.Background.(From the capitulation of the Duke of Aosta to the armistice in Syria.)1. &apos; This period has afforded little real satisfaction to the Italian people and fighting forces. The glamour of the &quot;Axis&quot; victories in Libya, Yugoslavia,Greece and Crete was already wearing off, while the German stranglehold on thewhole life of the nation remained, and produced at the best acquiescence, in thehope of sharing in the final German victory which is still generally believed in.The &quot;crusade against communism,&quot; otherwise Hitler&apos;s unprovoked attack onthe Soviet Union, is arousing considerable and no doubt genuine enthusiasm in italy, particularly among the upper and middle classes and also among the devoutgenerally. But at the same time we have had indications of the alarm caused bythe risks and uncertainties of so colossal an undertaking, by the fact that thelonged-for end of the war seems in consequence more remote than ever, and byGermany&apos;s callous abandonment of Italy to the tender mercies of our navy andair force in the Mediterranean.11464   [22804]
The Civilian Population.2.   None of the reports received indicates any marked elevation of popularmorale in consequence of the last of the series of &quot;Axis&quot; victories in theMediterranean, the occupation of Crete, though the Italians made out that theyhad played an important part in the operations.   A Swiss report suggests thatthe Italian people &quot; contemplate the rude vicissitudes of the Italian strugglewith a stoicism proportionate to the distance at which they are from the scene of war.&quot;   The report adds that &quot; Italian public opinion reveals itself morespontaneously in the provinces than in the capital, but even here, in spite of spies,it is very easy to get on to discussion and criticism.&quot;    From an excellentAmerican source we learn that, while aristocratic and high military circlesoutside the Fascist Party secretly hope that Britain will win, the majority of thepopulation believe that Germany has already won the war for them and look forward to peace even under German domination; all Italians, according to thesame source, are much ashamed of the poor showing their army put up in greece and Libj^a, of the failure of their air force, and of the reluctance of their fleet to fight a battle; and a depressing effect is produced on all sides by the thought of the necessity for a second conquest of Abyssinia immediately after the victorious peace is signed.   The Pome correspondent of a Scandinavian paper,after painting a bright picture of Italian morale (silent everyday heroism, firmresolve to hold out, no defeatism, &amp;c), goes on to say that there are neverthelesstwo shadows.  One is the fate of Abyssinia.  Even if the collapse of Italy&apos;s youngEmpire is hoped to be temporary, it has made a painful impression even on theaverage citizen; and the entry of the Negus into Addis Ababa under the aegis of the British was bitterly resented and regarded as an intentional humiliation.The second great shadow is the United States of America.   The people aresceptical, saj^s the correspondent, about the reassuring attempts of certainnewspapers to show that America&apos;s entry into the war cannot snatch victoryfrom Italy&apos;s and Germany&apos;s grasp.   Great respect is felt for America&apos;s richesand power, and there is no illusion regarding the consequences of her placing hermighty resources on Britain&apos;s side of the scale.   Finally, that even since the&quot; Axis &quot; victories all is not well with Italian morale is clearly shown by an article in the Messaggero, in which the following sentences occur :  &quot; The call fordiscipline must not be undermined.  Everyone must face up to the limitations ofthe hour.   Every speech and every gesture which might disaffect the public spiritis criminal.   There must be no speaking against the governing classes, norspreading of false news, nor criticism of any sort.&quot;   A Swiss banker who wasin Italy in mid-June went so far as to say that his Fascist friends were moredepressed than they were last November, notwithstanding the recent militarysuccesses, and the desire for peace seemed universal.The Army.3. A good Italian source with Vatican connexions has stated that theregular army as a, whole is opposed to the doctrines and leaders of the regime,and that the treatment of Badoglio by Mussolini was largely responsible for theexisting tension. No movement of revolt is, however, to be expected from thearmy, for, apart from the fact of the German occupation, (1) it is contrary to italian military tradition to take part in political movements, and (2) the Fascistregime has dissipated the strength and unity of the army by the creation of&quot;political&quot; generals, who act as policemen in the ranks. The army is incensedagainst the spectacular figure of General Cavallero, &quot;a thoroughly experiencedrobber,&quot; who is in favour with the regime because of his daughters relationswith Ciano.Other reports go to show that the morale of the army at home is very pooron the whole, and that there is a shortage of uniforms and equipment. Officerstry to cheer the men with talk of a big effort to end the war before the winter.Food shortage, aggravated by the occupation of Greece, is now affecting thearmy also.The Navy.4. The only report received which deals with the Navy says it has lost all its former prestige. German officers are now on every ship from destroyersupwards. Most of them are ex-Austrians who speak Italian. The submarineservice is the best part of the Navy.
The Air Force.5. A reliable informant describes the Italian Air Force as being in a &quot; fairly-poor state,&quot; and adds that it is not unusual for pilots to ask to be employed on ground duties on the excuse of nervous breakdown which is really seldom genuine.Mussolini and the Regime.6. According to the excellent American source already quoted, mussolini had lost much prestige at the end of the first year of the Anglo-Italian war; the short war he had promised still dragged on, and he was being blamed on all sidesfor accepting Croatia in return for the surrender of Italian claims to Corsica,Nice, &amp;c.The latest Fascist chief to fall from grace is Starace, a former secretary ofthe Fascist party, who, to quote a Rome message, &apos;&apos; is no longer a member ofthe Chamber of Fasci and Corporations.&quot; At the same time he &quot; ceased to occupy the post of Chief of Staff of the Fascist Militia.&quot; He has been succeeded in eachcapacity by Lieutenant-General Enzo Galbiati. Nothing is known for certain of the reasons for Starace&apos;s dismissal, but the popular version is that he had a violent quarrel with General Guzzoni about the situation in Albania; Mussoliniliquidated them both, whereupon Starace appealed to the King, as a result ofwhich Mussolini sent him to &quot; confino.&quot; Sebastiani. the Duce&apos;s private secretary,recently resigned &quot; for private reasons,&quot; and was somewhat frigidly thankedby his chief.A young American who had been studying in Milan stated that he had been greatly impressed by the fact that everyone he knew talked politics frequentlyand openly, and did not hesitate to criticise bitterly both the Government, and the fascist regime. He had not a single friend who had any Fascist sympathies,and was frightened to eat in certain restaurants, such was the open nature ofthe attacks heard. He was of opinion that 99 per cent, of the Milanese wereanti-Fascist and anti-war. A Swiss visitor to Milan said the Government was highly unpopular and Ciano cordially hated. A French Canadian priest on his way back from Rome expressed the belief that fascism would disappear, asit had little support in Italy.The Royal Family.7. An Italian who recently left Italy, and who is stated to be anti-Fascistin sentiment but objective, expressed himself in the following sense : It wouldbe a serious mistake to count on any eventual liberating action on the part ofthe House of Savoy. The Royal Family is in fact indissolubly bound up withthe fate of fascism. The Italian people are well aware of this and make nosecret of their lack of confidence in the reigning House. Neither the King northe Crown Prince will take any action against the Fascist regime. The crown prince is generally regarded as a man of neither moral nor intellectual worth.The Royal Family has never ceased to show its solidarity with the regime, andcertain leanings on the part of the Crown Prince definitely ceased at the time ofthe Italian conquest of Abyssinia.Feeling towards the Germans.8. The young American quoted above said that he had heard a lot of anti-German feelings expressed; a great many Milanese whom he knew had beenunder &quot; German &quot; (i.e., Austrian) rule during the last war, and objected to theGermans as allies. Another American informant said that the feeling betweenthe Italian and German armed forces was veiy bad. The German Headquartershad planned all Axis activities in connexion with the North African and Cretancampaigns without consulting the Italian Ministry of War. This causeddissatisfaction, as did the use of Italian troops in advance contact in north africa and the resulting disproportionate Italian casualties. Italian prisonersstated that General Rommel had had high Italian officers shot, and had been givencomplete control by Mussolini; while disagreement between Germans and Italianswas said to exist from commanders downwards. A traveller has declared thatthe coolness between German and Italian soldiers in Occupied France was obviousto all; Italian and German soldiers never fraternised, and their officers werenever seen together. The German &quot; Hausfrau &quot; is now a familiar and unpopularsight in Rome, where large numbers of them are to be seen resolutely buying up
food and clothing. Finally, according to a Berlin source, there is bad bloodbetween German and Italian labourers in Germany. Incidentally, the latter are said to arrive at the Italian frontier stations under armed German escort.Feeling towards Great Britain.9. The American student from Milan, already quoted more than once,reported that he had never heard any expression of criticism or dislike of GreatBritain. A Swiss, just returned from a visit to Milan, said there was practically no feeling against England in Northern Italy. There is evidence that propaganda against Great Britain on the ground that she is supporting the Soviet union is having some effect, &apos;&apos; but not nearly so much as might have been expected, asthe people long to be liberated from the Germans.&quot; An American source in Romestates : &apos;&apos; Everyone we know listens to the English radio, and in a little countrytown everyone, including the police and carabinieri, listens eagerly to it in italian every afternoon, gathered together in a crowd in the street by the opendoor of the room where the radio is.&quot; In pro-British circles in Rome it was beingsaid, according to a Polish source, that British propaganda, promising that aBritish victory would not be disastrous for Italy, should be prepared against theproper time, which had not, however, yet come.The Food Situation.10. From the numerous reports received we learn that rations have seriouslydeteriorated in quantity and in quality, and that the cost of food keeps rising.Butter is unobtainable, even in the best hotels, and pork is very scarce, 1,000 pigsweekly being exported to Germany. Rice and marcaroni are reserved exclusivelyfor Italian consumption, yet the quotas are far below normal. The rich cansatisfy all their needs when stocks are available, and it is thought that unless this can, be stopped conditions will be intolerable next winter. For the presentreal hunger is only felt in some hill villages, and is due to bad distribution. Thereis a serious shortage of fats and vegetable oils, causing great discontent; and,in the larger towns, a complete lack of many food-stuffs. Meat is allowed onlyone day a week. Shortage of bread led to the breaking of bakers&apos; windows inMilan. At the same time, we are told that money is plentiful and that restaurantsand theatres are constantly crowded.That the food situation must indeed be serious is clear from Mussolini&apos;sspeech on the first anniversary of Italy&apos;s entry into the war. He told his Italianhearers, what they certainly already knew, that with the continuation of the warthe spiritual and material tension of the people was increasing and life was becoming harder for them; the recent critical period in the food situation hadbeen due to the exhaustion of the country&apos;s resources and to the increase of population consequent on the acquisition of the new territories; these foodproblems would, however, be solved, and the war profiteers would be punishedseverely.Conclusion.11. Italian morale has undergone no marked change during the period under review. It is neither very bad nor very good, much less good than mighthave been expected as a result of the long succession of &quot; Axis &quot; victories, theacquisition of Slovenia and Dalmatia, the setting up of Croatia under an Italianking, the occupation of most of Greece, and the opportunity given by the german attack on the Soviet Union to indulge in the emotions of an anti-Communistcrusade. It is clear that none of these things has been able to dissipate thedepression caused by the continuance of the war, with its increasing hardshipsand bereavements, the reinforced tyranny of the party agents, the unremittingstrangle-hold of the occupying Germans, and the lurking fear of what the futuremay hold in store, whether or not the Axis wins the final victory.Foreign Office, July 18, 1941
