THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  September 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (41) 211.September 1, 1941.WAR CABINET.SUPPLY FROM NORTH AMERICA.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.I HAVE had under consideration, in consultation with some of mycolleagues, the arrangements in regard to the organisation and personnel of theBritish Supply Council in North America. (The present arrangements, as approved by the War Cabinet on the 12th December, 1940, are set out in theAppendix to this Note.)2. I have accepted the recommendation of Lord Halifax and Lord Beaver-brook that Mr. Morris Wilson, at present Deputy Chairman of the Council, should now be appointed Chairman, in succession to Mr. Arthur Purvis. As Chairmanhe will preside at the Council which will determine general policy.3. I have also approved the proposal that, in order to provide for the increasingly heavy responsibilities falling upon the chief officers of the Council,a new officer should be appointed who will bear the title of Vice-Chairman and president, the latter title being in common use on the American continent.The Vice-Chairman and President will be the chief executive officer of theCouncil, and will be responsible for the day-to-day business relating to supplies.Mr. E. P. Taylor, who at present represents the Canadian Government in washington in respect of the Supply Agreement between the two countries, hasbeen appointed to the new post of Vice-Chairman and President.
4. Advantage is said to lie in appointing another Canadian to this post.Mr. Taylor, who has been most successful in his present post, is expected to be aforceful and effective representative of our interests to the United states authorities.5. Experience has shown that, while representations to the United states authorities should continue to be made by the Council, there is need for closer -ordination between the Council and the heads of the Joint Staff Mission. Forthis purpose the following arrangements will take effect : (i) The Council will look to the heads of the Joint Staff Mission in washington for advice on all technical and military matters,(ii) The heads of the Joint Staff Mission will be responsible for making such representations as may be necessary to the War Department and theNavy Department on the strategical aspects of our supply needs,(iii) The heads of the Joint Staff Mission will not initiate representations on supply matters without prior consultation with the Council.6. Nothing in the above will, of course, affect the position of the heads ofthe Joint Staff Mission as the representatives of the Chiefs of Staff. They willcontinue to discuss strategical questions with the War Department or the navy department without reference to the Supply Council.7. Communications from Great Britain with the Supply Council willcontinue to be directed through the North American Supply Committee; but, inorder to ensure that the instructions given to our representatives in north america are based on strategic as well as supply considerations, it will benecessary that the Service Ministers should become members of the north american Supply Committee, which will be responsible for all requisitionssubmitted to the United States Government.W. S. C.September 1, 1941.
