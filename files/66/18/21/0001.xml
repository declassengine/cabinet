(44) 198.August 21, 1941.WAR CABINET.THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE  COMMONWEALTH  OFAUSTRALIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE attached despatch from the Acting United Kingdom HighCommissioner at Canberra about the political situation in the Commonwealthof Australia will, I think, be of interest to members of the War Cabinet.&apos;.    C.Dominions Office, August 21, 1941.Office of the High Commissioner(No. 118.   Secret.) for the United Kingdom,My Lord, Canberra, July 14, 1941.I HAVE the honour to report on the proceedings of-the late meeting of theFederal Parliament, which reassembled on the 25th June and adjourned on the4th July till the end of August, when the Budget will be submitted.2. In the House of Representatives about a third of the time was devotedto a debate on the international situation. The debate was opened by a speechby Mr. Curtin reaffirming the Labour Party&apos;s full support of the war and generally endorsing the Prime Ministers &quot; prospectus of an unlimited war effort,&quot;subject to a mild and cautiously worded reservation as to the Prime Ministersreference to &quot;the vexed question of the rights and obligations of^labour in wartime,&quot; or, in other words, to the proposed prohibition of strikes in war industries.Mr. Curtin also accepted the view that &quot; the battle in the Middle East is ofcrucial importance to Great Britain and Australia,&quot; but emphasised that australia &quot;cannot afford that battle to go against it in circumstances thatprecluded the subsequent movement of the Mediterranean Fleet into the Indian-Ocean or the Atlantic Ocean&quot;; for, in that event, Singapore, &quot; instead of being a bastion for Australia, would become merely a service station for an enemy.&quot;Similarly, while recognising that, &quot;as things now stand, the Middle East and singapore can be regarded as outer bastions of Australia,&quot; Mr. Curtin submitted that &quot; no nation completely denudes its last line of defence, which is its own.territory, in order to resist the enemy at an outpost,&quot; and that &quot; there must be some assessment between the manhood required for production in Australia andfor defence within Australia, and the number of men we can use for service overseas.&quot; Finally, referring to the equipment of air support of the forces intihe Middle East and the Mediterranean, Mr. Curtin said : &quot; A certain amount of thinking is going on throughout Australia inrespect of what are now known to be the reasons why we were driven outof Greece and Crete. It is only reasonable to say that the Government of thiscountry, and I hope also the Government of the United Kingdom, will haveregard to what I believe to be the undoubted public feeling on this matter.I shall not attempt to put it into words.&quot;[22839]
3. Mr. Curtin&apos;s restraint was not imitated by his followers, and the rest ofthe debate largely consisted&quot; of a series of speeches by Labour members, mainly from New South Wales, accusing the United Kingdom and commonwealth governments of &quot; cold-blooded murder &quot; in sending inadequately equipped troops to be &quot;butchered&quot; in Greece and Oete. Among these speakers, Mr. Beasley,a member of the Advisory War Council, was particularly vehement, declaring that &apos;&apos; when our troops were thrown into battle in Greece they lacked almost allessential equipment &quot; ; demanding that the United Kingdom Government shouldbe told in unambiguous language &apos;&apos; that never again will Australian soldiers beallowed to fight in such unfavourable circumstances&quot;; and declaring that theresponsibility fell on Mr. Churchill, who was &quot;not entitled to the tributes that have been paid to him&quot; and did not &quot; adorn his high office.&quot; The impressioncreated by the speeches, in at any rate some quarters of the House, was expressedtowards the close of the debate by a Government member, General Rankin. Afterreferring to General Wavell&apos;s initial victories, he said, amidst loud applause : &apos;&apos; Honourable members opposite were prepared to bask in the reflectedglory of the Australians at that time. But when we met reverses ....honourable members opposite began to squeal. It was not squealers who made the name of the A.I.F. in the last war, and it is not squealers who willwin this war. There are some members of the Opposition whom I admire.Some of them took their part in the last war, and others1 have seen fighting in this war, but there is a section in the centre who are a disgrace to thiscountry.&apos;&apos;4. Before the debate was concluded the behaviour or remarks of members had twice made it necessary to apply the censorship. On the second day someprovocative remarks by a youthful Labour member led to an exchange ofchallenges and counter-challenges to join the army, and on the following morning to further incidents in the Hall of Parliament House of so undignified a characterthat the.Government decided to prohibit the publication of a report of them inorder to prevent the discrediting of Parliament. On the last day of the debatea Labour member disclosed that the Minister for the Army had stated in secret session that one hostile armoured division would be sufficient to conquerAustralia. Owing to a blunder by a censorship official, the instructions issuedby the Government that this remark should be censored, was applied to the wholeof the debate, including not merely Mr. Beasley&apos;s speech, but the Minister for theArmy&apos;s reply to it. It is characteristic that, though it was at once explainedthat the Government had not intended that the censorship of the debate should go beyond one particular statement, not only Labour politicians, but the Sydneypress, including the Sydney Morning Herald, treated the incident as if it hadbeen a deliberate attempt by the Government to muzzle Parliament and stiflecriticism.5. Shortly before Parliament adjourned, the Prime Minister, in response to an appeal by Mr. Curtin, agreed to postpone the introduction of a Bill for thepurpose of giving effect to a decision which he had announced in his broadcastof the 17th June, in the following terms :  ... .&apos;&apos; The time has passed for merely protesting against strikes and lockoutsin war and allied industries. We propose to prohibit them, and to accompany that prohibition by giving to the Courts full powers to take themost vigorous action against those who counsel or encourage them.&quot;Mr. Curtin&apos;s appeal was, in effect, that the Government, before proceeding to&quot;disciplinary action,&quot; should give those concerned one more chance to see whether industrial peace could not be secured by consultation and negotiation;and in responding to it the Prime Minister was actuated by the desire to go asfar as possible to meet and co-operate with the moderate elements in the LabourParty. Nevertheless, this fresh and glaring example of the Governmentspractice of announcing a decision to make a stand and then hastily withdrawingwas bound to have a most damaging effect on their prestige both in parliament and the country. The effects were accentuated by the return which the Govern-ment met for this concession on the following day, when, in the absence ofMr. Curtin, they were defeated three times by the combined votes of the LabourParty and Mr. Wilson, the independent member who held the balance.
6. In my telegram No. 227 of the 5th July I reported the Prime Ministersreaction to these political developments, and in my telegram No. 230 of the7th July I reported the immediate sequel, namely, the calling off of the SydneyWaterside Workers&apos; strike under pressure from Federal Labour politicians,including Mr. Beasley, on the ground that if it went on the Government would use it to precipitate a general election on the industrial issue. Though thisparticular incident has been closed, there is a possibility that the Governmentmay be presented with a further opportunity by the New South Wales engineers,who have called a stop work meeting on the 28th July to discuss plans for astrike of engineering shops, ammunition annexes and aircraft plant if their demands for increased wages and improved working conditions have not been previously conceded. In the meantime the Prime Minister has declared that a recent stoppage at the Broken Hill, Pty. Co.&apos;s works at Newcastle has causeddamage to the war effort which was &quot; deliberate and could hardly have been improved upon by an open enemy of the country.&quot; Mr. Curtin, on the otherhand, has delivered a most conciliatory speech re-emphasising his party&apos;determination not to use their parliamentary numbers merely to embarrass theGovernment, and holding up the new system of parliamentary committees as indicating that &quot; political partisanship is giving way to national well-being.&quot;7. The present position, therefore, seems to be that the Prime Ministerremains in favour of fighting, on the industrial issue, and would take theopportunity of a serious strike in the war industries to bring matters to a head,e.g., by reintroducing the Bill for prohibiting strikes and lockouts in war industries. The section of the Labour Party represented by Mr. Beasley and dr. Evatt, while reluctant to fight on this issue, would be prepared to turn theGovernment out on the issue of broadening the base of taxation which will beraised by the forthcoming Budget. Mr. Curtin, on the other hand, who still remains the most powerful influence in the Parliamentary Labour Party, would prefer the maintenance of the status quo. In these circumstances the immediatepolitical future is likely to depend upon whether the Labour leaders can avoid any serious industrial disturbance before Parliament reassembles, and, if so, uponwhether it will be possible for Mr. Curtin and the moderate elements in the partyto arrange a repetition of the compromise reached between the Government and &quot;the Labour Caucus on the Budget proposals submitted last December.8.   A copy of this despatch is being sent to the High Commissioner for theUnited Kingdom in New Zealand.I have the honour to be,My Lord,Your most obedient, humble Servant,(Signed) R. R. SEDGWICK,Acting High Commissioner.f
