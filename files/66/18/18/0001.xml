As His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom hadalready announced their intention to promote measures for the supply of food and raw materials to Europe as soon as it has been freed from German domina-tion, it seemed appropriate that the next inter-Allied meeting should discuss thisquestion, which is of particular interest to the Allied Governments now inLondon and to their oppressed populations at home.Last autumn, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, with the assistance of a Committeeof officials and reporting to a Ministerial Committee under the Chairmanship ofthe Minister without Portfolio, was entrusted with organising the work in con-nexion with surplus commodities. This covered immediate action to assistproducing countries and plans for the supply of post-war European needs.Sir F. Leith-Ross has been in consultation informally with certain of the Alliedauthorities concerned, but it is desirable to put these consultations on a moreformal footing and to arrange for the future co-ordination of inter-Alliedactivities. It is therefore proposed to hold an inter-Allied meeting for thispurpose.Preliminary consultations with regard to such a meeting have taken place between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the DominionGovernments, who are directly interested as suppliers, and also with the UnitedStates Government through the United States Ambassador in London. TheDominion Governments have agreed to be represented at the proposed meeting and to associate themselves with the Resolution, which it is intended to submit for adoption.  The draft of the proposed Resolution is attached as Annex A.The United States Government have expressed the view that &apos;&apos; the under-taking is of great prospective usefulness,&quot; and that they are &quot; ready at theappropriate time to consider in what respects they can co-operate in accomplishingthe aims in view.&quot; They have asked to be kept fully informed of the course ofthe inter-Allied discussions at the meeting and arising out of the meeting.The United States Ambassador has been informed that we have in mind that, if the proposed Allied meeting produces satisfactory results, we hope to11468   [22817]
approach the United States Government in due course with a view to establishingjointly with His Majesty&apos;s Government, and later with the other producing orstockholding countries, an organisation to examine the problem of thereprovisioning of Europe from the point of view of arranging for supplies to bemade available. We also hoped that eventually information and views mightbe exchanged between this organisation and the Allied Bureau to be set up inaccordance with section 6 of the draft Resolution (Annex A). The ambassador was also informed that we had not overlooked the needs of neutral and enemy countries, which might well require consideration, and also the needs of countries outside Europe, such, for instance, as China.Finally, they have authorised the British representative at the meeting tomake a statement on behalf of the United States Government, the text of which isattached as Annex B. Section (5) of the draft Resolution regarding shipping has been amended to meet certain U.S. suggestions, and the concurrence of theUnited States Government in the amended text is now awaited before approaching the Allied Governments. The latter are, however, already aware of the generaloutline of our proposals.It is proposed to invite to the meeting representatives of all the Allies,including the U.S.S.R. and the Free French. The meeting will be opened by an explanation of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomand of the action they have already set on foot; the Allied representatives will then be invited to state their views, and, finally, the Resolution, which will havebeen agreed beforehand, will be submitted for formal approval. I would suggestthat I should preside at the first meeting, and that the Minister without Portfolioshould then be entrusted with any further discussions arising out of the meeting.The Secretaries of State for India and Burma, for the Dominions and for theColonies should also be invited to the first meeting.In my speech at Leeds on the 5th July, in my speech to the Foreign PressAssociation on the 29th July and in reply to a parliamentary question on the6th August, I have already referred to the intention to hold another inter-Alliedmeeting in the near future. Preliminary arrangements have taken rather longer than was anticipated.and, in view of the public interest aroused and the curiosityalready displayed by some of the Allies, it is desirable to hold the proposed meeting as soon as possible. The 27th August is the date at present proposed, provided theAmerican reply is received in time to enable the preliminary discussions to becompleted with the Allies.A. E.Foreign Office, August 16, 1941.i

It understands that the present discussions will be of an exploratory nature, and states that its stands ready atthe appropriate time to consider in what respects it can co-operate in accom-plishing the aims in view.&quot; It has pointed out that any plans that may be worked out are of greatpotential interest to the United States for various reasons. They might affect thecurrent American defence effort. According to their substance, form and methodthey might also affect commercial policies and relationships and even broaderpost-war arrangements. For these reasons it makes the request that it be keptfully advised regarding the course of these exploratory discussions, and that itbe consulted regarding any plans which might emerge therefrom.&quot;
