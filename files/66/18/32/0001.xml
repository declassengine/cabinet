THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  August 1941.SECRET / Copy No.W.P. (41) 209.August 30, 1941.WAR CABINET.THE AMERICAN POSITION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I CIRCULATE, for the information of the War Cabinet, a letter from theUnion High Commissioner in London, forwarding a telegram from General Smutsin regard to the American position.C.Dominions Office, August 30, 1941.South Africa House,Trafalgar Square, W.C. 2,My dear Secretary of State, August 29, 1941.THE following is an extract from a telegram which I have just receivedfrom General Smuts in regard to the American position : &quot; As regards America, the position is clearly far from being satisfactory.I have all along felt that our propaganda there should have been prosecutedmore strenuously in favour of active participation in the war, and not merelygreater war supplies. We shall not win this war without active american assistance and our propaganda should be based on that assumption. Americawill come into the war, but it may be only after disastrous losses have beensuffered. Russia&apos;s present contribution, is most valuable, but will not last,as the Russians are never good stayers. In the end the British Commonwealthmay have to face the Axis plus Japan alone. When, this winter, the germans have stabilised their occupation of Western Russia, including its main centres of production, they  will be able to release very large forces for attack notonly on Great Britain, but also in the whole Mediterranean basin, whileJapan will look upon this as their opportunity in the East.&quot; I place little reliance on Turkey, which may now be still morefrightened by Russia being on her Eastern frontier in Iran than by the reported Bulgarian activities in Thrace. We may have to face a german occupation of North-West Africa and a new menace on the vital atlantic route, the Libyan position, if not then already liquidated, may become far more difficult,&quot; while the main enemy attack on Egypt may be launched,through Turkey with or without her passive assistance.&apos; With our difficultlines of supply in the Middle East and our shipping shortage added to.ourman-power difficulties, we may be hard put to hold our own in the Medi-terranean area. Meanwhile, our main forces will have to be prepared todeal with -a possible attack on Great Britain. We could not possibly do all this alone and American opinion has to be hastened to the inevitable decision[22871]
by intensive propaganda in addition to diplomatic pressure. I fear that weare all relying too much on continued Russian resistance, and disillusionmay overtake us when America is still out of the war and unprepared andwe have to face the storm alone. Our own preparations have to be accelerated,but not less so all possible steps to get the United States into the war.&quot;I have been asked by General Smuts to inform you of his views on thisquestion, as he considers action on the above lines most desirable.Yours sincerely,(Signed) SIDNEY F. WATERSON.The Right Honourable Viscount Cranborne,Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.
