naval SITUATION.General Review.1.   There have been no outstanding events at sea during the period.Allied  submarines  continue  to  harass  enemy  communications   in  theMediterranean.Shipping losses have been light in spite of the large number of U-boats at sea.Home Waters.2. On the 9th, civil aircraft reported sighting a suspected merchant raider220 miles south-west of Brest steering west. A search was made by air and surface craft without result, and patrols were established to intercept her shouldshe break out to the south.H.M. Trawler Withernsea shot down a Heinkel III in the Humber on the9th and another enemy aircraft was damaged by H.M. Trawler Liberator offAldeburgh on the 13th.Two of our motor gunboats were in collision off the Dutch coast on the nightthe 10th/11th, one being sunk and the other severely damaged.Mediterranean.3. . On the 31st July, H.M. Submarine Regent sank by gunfire a largeschooner laden with petrol and stores to the southward of Benghazi andbombarded Apolonia (Libya) at dusk on the 6th August. The NetherlandsSubmarine 024, while on patrol in the Central Mediterranean, sank a ladensupply ship of 5,000 tons and a sailing vessel of 1,000 tons.On the 11th, H.M. net layer Protector, 60 miles northward of Port Said, was hit by a torpedo from an aircraft, but reached harbour safely.During the week 12 French merchant ships (66,000 tons) have passed gibraltar in convoy eastbound and 5 (19,000 tons) westbound.Anti-Submarine Operations.4. H.M. Submarine Severn probably torpedoed a U-boat 250 miles south-west of Cape St. Vincent and aircraft from H.M.S. London, on patrol north-west of the Azores, bombed and probably damaged a U-boat which was on the surface.Attacks by surface craft were carried out in the vicinity of Start Point and off cape St. Vincent without definite result. Eight attacks were made by aircraft,six in the Western Approaches and two to the westward of Lisbon. One of thelatter possibly damaged a U-boat, but the remainder were without definite result.Enemy Intelligence.5. The Pocket Battleship Admiral Scheer was reported to be back in KielBay on 4th August. Otherwise no change has been reported in the positions ofthe main German and Italian units. The Italian Fleet Auxiliary tanker Tarvisioarrived at Chanak from the iEgean on 10th August, and is said to have been detained for -the present by the Turkish authorities.U-Boats.6. About 30 German U-Boats and six or more Italians have been operating in the Atlantic. About one-third of the total have been in the area westward of gibraltar, and of the remainder four or five have been south of Iceland (C),between 15c and 200 West.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.. 7. According to the information at present available, shipping casualties during the week have been exceptionally light. No losses by U-boat action ormine have been reported. Casualties from bombing have taken place off the faroes and Cape St. Vincent. One ship was damaged in an air. attack onAlexandria. One ship was sunk and three were damaged in bombing attacks on East coast convoys.  One ship in a Channel convoy was sunk by E-boat.
The shipping losses in July (details of which are given in Appendix I)were 28 ships and 10 small craft totalling 136,067 tons, of which 19 ships and10 small craft (109,780 tons) were British. This total is 199,529 tons lower thanthe previous month, and the British tonnage lost is the lowest since May of lastyear. Twenty-one ships (91,723 tons) were sunk by U-boats, five ships and sixsmall craft (36,894 tons) by aircraft and two ships and four small craft (7,450tons) by mines. Of the losses from U-boats, twenty ships, including nine in oneconvoy, were sunk in the Azores-Cape Verde area, only one ship was lost in theNorth-West Approaches and none in the Freetown area.In addition, 12 ships and 6 small craft totalling 49,083 tons, which areincluded in Appendix I, were reported in July but lost in previous months.Protection of Seaborne Trade.8. During the week ending 13th August, 953 ships, including 162 allied and 22 neutral, were convoyed. 9 armed merchant cruisers, 72 destroyers and 86 sloops, minesweepers and corvettes were employed on escort duties.4,420 ships in convoy arrived during July, of which 10 ships were lost by enemy action. Since the beginning of the war 74,638 ships have been convoyed, of which369 have been lost.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending9th August totalled 818,859 tons, compared with 1,177,422 during the previousweek, and an average of 875,274 tons during the past ten weeks. Oil importstotalled 294,134 tons. Mineral imports were 215,746 tons, of which 154,014 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig ore and iron ore. Timber and- pulp imports amountedto 41,365 tons, and there were 6,021 tons of newsprint. Cereal imports amountedto 116,517 tons. Other food imports totalled 146,945, of which 75,420 tons weresugar and molasses. Among other foodstuffs there were bacon, ham andrefrigerated meat 8,003 tons, cheese 4,470 tons, cocoa 4,423 tons, fish 1,936 tons,dried fruit 1,727 tons, tea 1,261 tons, jam and honey 650 tons and unspecifiedtinned food 4,661 tons. There was also 1,615 tons of tobacco. General cargoesincluded large consignments of motor trucks, aircraft, ammunition and machinery.British Minelaying.9. Two minelaying operations have been carried out by surface craft in thecourse of the week. On the 9th August, M.T.B&apos;s. laid eight mines off the Belgiancoast, and on the 11th H.M.S. Port Quebec laid a further 484 off North Fiona.There has been some minelaying by aircraft chiefly in the Western Balticand off the Norwegian coast.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.10. Enemy aircraft have dropped mines in the Thames Estuary on three nights during the past week, and once off Harwich.Eleven magnetic and twelve acoustic mines have been swept during the week.The totals now are: Acoustic, 932; magnetic, 1,328; contact, 1,021; including those accounted for in Foreign Waters.Foreign Waters.11. Enemy aircraft raided the Suez Canal on the nights of 6th/7th and10th/11th August. On each occasion mines were dropped in or near the canal and, in the first raid, off Port Ibrahim as well. The Canal was not, however,closed.Early on 11th August four mines were dropped in the western part of tobruk Harbour.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.12. It has been reported that on 1st August forty German ships weredischarging military stores at Mantyluoto, in Finland.[22812] &apos; b
The Norderney (3,867 tons) sailed from Para, Brazil, on the 9th August.She is believed to have a valuable cargo of rubber, castor seeds, castor oil andhides.Italian.Two tankers, the Maya (3,867 tons) and Albara (2,104 tons) called at Istanbulon 8th August on passage from the Black Sea to the aegean&amp;n; they were fullyloaded. The A bbazia (3,706 tons) passed Chanak on 9th August, bound for the aegean.Intelligence.Vichy French Merchant Shiysping.13. The British Navy&apos;s recent successes in intercepting French ships,combined with recent political events, have led to the temporary suspension ofsailings on the France-Antilles and France-Indo-China services. information has been received that these routes are now considered dangerous by the ArmisticeCommissions, who are refusing to sanction any further voyages at present. Itseems probable that in future efforts will be made for ships on these routes tosail in convoy under naval escort.Black Sea.14. A report states that the Russian air raids on Constanza during thefirst week in August caused considerable damage to the port and town, but thatthe grain silos were undamaged. The same report, however, states that consider-able damage was done to the petroleum basin and that tankers have experienceddifficulty in loading.Persian Gulf.15. The Persian Navy at present consists of two sloops armed.with two4-inch and two 3-inch guns and having a speed of 14 to 17 knots, and four smallpatrol ships mounting two 3-inch guns and having a speed of 15 knots. Thereis also a minesweeper and floating dock at Bandar Shahpur. The engineers in practically all the ships in the Persian Navy are Italian./ apan.16. A good authority states that it is the intention of the Japanese fleet to remain at Ariake Bay until the end of this month and then to proceed to theYokohama area in time for the large-scale manoeuvres which are under contem-contemplation.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.17. During the past week no appreciable advance has been made except inthe Ukraine, where the main German effort has been exerted.Finland.18. Little news has been received, but in the far north the front appears tobe stabilised and there is no sign of an immediate German threat to Murmansk.Fighting continues on the Salla front. North-east of Lake Ladoga, German andFinnish forces have made little progress towards Petrozavodsk, and the murmansk-Leningrad Railway is still in Russian hands along its whole length.Baltic Front.19. German forces have reached the south coast of the Gulf of Finlandbetween Tallinn.and Narva. Tallinn and Baltic Port are thus cut off, butare still in Russian hands.20. To the east of Lake Peipus no serious attempt seems to have been madeto advance on Leningrad. Fighting has taken place further south in the Kholmarea, but so far no drive towards the Leningrad-Moscow Railway has. developed.
White Russia.21. In the last few days there has been activity in the Roslavl area. Onthe 9th August, the Germans claimed to have surrounded Soviet formations inthis area and to have taken 38,000 prisoners. No mention of this was made by theSoviet. - If it is true, it may indicate a south-easterly drive on the Bryansk-Gomel railway. There have been no further reports of resistance in this area byisolated pockets of Russians, .Ukraine.22. The attack on Kiev is continuing, and on the 12th August the Germansclaimed the capture of Vasilkov, 30 miles south of the city.23. Another attack, south-eastwards and southwards, has&apos; achieved aconsiderable measure of success, the left flank having advanced parallel with the dnieper and reached the vicinity of Kremenchug, which is on the Dnieper somesome 160 miles south-east of Kiev. Further to the west, armoured and motorisedforces are driving southwards towards Nikolaev, and their advanced elements are believed to be within 30 or 40 miles of the port.24. Further west, German infantry are advancing eastwards and south-eastwards roughly from the area Birsula-Tiraspol.25. Russian sources claim that the armoured thrusts have far outstrippedthe infantry, and the Russian communique claimed, up to the 11th August, thatthere was still heavy fighting &quot; in the direction &quot; of Uman. It may be, therefore,that another large pocket of Russians is still holding out south of that place.26. The situation in the Ukraine is undoubtedly very serious. With the capture of Odessa and Nikolaev the whole of the Ukraine to the west of the dnieper from Kiev to its mouth would fall into German hands. This appears tobe the immediate German objective.Operations.Egypt and Libya.27. In the Tobruk area, on the 3rd August, we attacked posts on both flanksof the enemy&apos;s position in the Medawa salient. Heavy fighting resulted and considerable enemy mortar fire was experienced. After fierce fighting our troopsentered the post. An accurate estimate of enemy casualties was not possible, butthey were known to be heavy.   We lost 28 killed and 104 wounded,28. Apart from this there is little to report from this area with theexception of intermittent enemy shelling and bombing of the town and harbour,none of which has apparently caused much damage.29. In the Frontier area, Jarabub has now been occupied by our troops andthere has been normal artillery activity by our columns against small parties of enemy M.T.A abyssinia.30. There w-as a serious fire at Massawa on 7th/8th August, whichdestroyed the ordnance ammunition dump, the customs dump and the larger partof a nearby native village.  There were no military casualties.Intelligence.Germany.31. There is evidence that the number of German divisions in existenceexceeds the figure of 250 divisions hitherto accepted. The motorisation of infantry divisions continues, and it is believed that 25 of these may now exist, ofwhich 21 (including one light armoured division) have been identified. Inaddition, an S.S. Cavalry division has recently been identified.[22812] .      b 2     ,
32. It is considered that a total of 260 divisions may now be accepted. Ofthese, some 30-40 divisions are of low category, intended primarily for L. of C. or similar employment. It is probable that many of these divisions are now employed behind the Eastern Front.33. There is evidence that some of the divisions in the West and in Norwayhave sent drafts of trained men to the East, receiving considerable numbers of recruits and of elderly reservists as replacements, so that the fighting efficiency of these divisions must have been markedly reduced.Italy. -34. There has been a tendency to reinforce gradually southern Italy andthe islands. There are now six divisions stationed on.the mainland south of rome and three, or possibly four, divisions in Sardinia; the garrison of Sicilyremains at two divisions, though there are indications that one Sicilian division which took part in the Greek campaign may be returning. Taken in conjunctionwith efforts to raise &quot;territorial battalions&quot; (home defence units composed of older men for coast defence, guarding of vulnerable, points, &amp;c), this movementprobably denotes increasing Italian awareness of the vulnerability of their greatlength of coast-line.Roumania.35. The Vega refinery at Ploesti was bombed by the Russians on the28th July and 400 car-loads of unspecified products are believed to have been destroyed. Numerous reports confirm that severe damage was caused to the Orionrefineries in the raid of the 13th July, and it is believed that the adjoining Shell,Astra Romana and Lumina plants suffered minor damage in the same raid. Theseraids will not immediately affect production, as there are large surplus stocks ofrefined&apos; products in the country, and the refining capacity in Roumania is considerably in excess of crude output.36. More immediately serious to the enemy is the damage to oil-loadingfacilities at Constanza, which will probably prevent the resumption of oil exports from this port for two months even if the porfs extremely vulnerable landcommunications remain intact.Yugoslavia.37. Guerrilla activity continues and the area of disturbance has spreadthrough Bosnia to Croatia and Slovenia. Material destruction and loss of life isprobably small, but even in districts where no outbreaks have occurred the constant threat of violence must be having a very disturbing effect on an administration which is by no means sure of itself.North and West Africa.38. Several sources report that the Germans are again pressing for the cession of bases in Africa, and General Weygand&apos;s visit to Vichy is no doubtconnected with this. There may well be some truth in the suggestion that thereason underlying this demand, in the case of North Africa, is not so much the difficult supply situation in Libya as the desire to control French action in tunisia in the event of a British offensive in Libya. In the case of Dakar, theGermans and their French satellites may wish to forestall any possible action bythe United States or Britain. .Far East.39. The chief areas of Japanese military activity continue to be Manchukuoand Indo-China. It is evident that the Japanese intend assembling the maximumconcentration possible in the Northern Zone, while retaining sufficient forces inthe South for any further southward operations they may contemplate.40. It is estimated that approximately 35,000 Japanese troops have landed in Southern Indo-China. Of these, about 4,000 are believed to have been moved to the Thai (Siamese) frontier. The disembarkation of troops continues, but itis reported that it will shortly be completed.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.41. The main feature of the week was a combined operation during daylight by aircraft of Bomber and Fighter Commands, in which power stations at Cologne were attacked, apparently with complete success. Bombing by night of a wide selection of industrial targets in Germany was continued whenweather permitted.Several enemy attacks were made on the Suez Canal area.Enemy activity over this country was on a small scale.&apos;.[. i/i&apos;;: &apos; .&apos;;.r .  ;; * &quot; germany and Occupied Territory. &apos;Day.42. Bomber Command despatched 102 sorties, compared with 103 last week,and dropped 48 tons of H.E. bombs and 200 incendiaries by day. Fighter Com-mand flew 1,182 aircraft sorties.43. The heaviest daylight bombing raid against Germany since the outbreakof war was carried out with considerable success on the 12th August. In thismajor operation 78 bombers and 485 fighters were employed; the targets were two of the main power stations in the Rhineland the Goldenburg at Cologne-Knapsack and the Quadrath Fortuna at Cologne^The day&apos;s operations began with a sweep by 84 fighters escorting 6 Hampdensin an attack on St. Omer aerodrome, the object being to draw off the enemyforce based in the district; it is estimated that 150 Me. 109s were engaged inthe combats which ensued. While this operation was in progress 54 Blenheims,escorted by Whirlwinds of Fighter Command, left the coast and, flying low overthe sea, penetrated through the mouth of the Scheldt to Antwerp, where thecovering Whirlwinds returned to base. Simultaneously, a Fortress bombed DeKooy aerodrome from. 32,000 feet, to keep enemy fighters in that area employed.Meanwhile the Blenheims, flying close to the ground, located and attacked, underfavourable weather conditions, the two power stations at Cologne. From reports received, both power stations appear to have been severely damaged in mostdetermined attacks; 24 tons of bombs were dropped on the turbine and boiler houses and the targets were left with fires blazing. Heavy A.A. fire was encountered,but only three Me. 109s were seen; further diversions by Fortresses over Cologneand the naval base at Emden assisted in drawing off enemy fighters, which might otherwise have attacked. These Fortresses released their bombs from 35,000 and37,000 feet respectively.The Blenheims were met at Antwerp on their homeward journey byformations of Spitfires and, during this withdrawal, a further diversion wascarried out by 144 fighters escorting 6 Hampdens to attack Gosnay power station,, near Bethune; bursts were seen on or around the target. Later, 4Blenheims with fighter escort bombed the shipyards at Le Trait, near Rouen,hits being obtained on slipways and on a ship alongside.In this series of co-ordinated operations we lost 12 Blenheims and 10fighters. Four enemy aircraft were destroyed, 5 probably destroyed and 10damaged.44. On two other days during the week, offensive sweeps over northern france resulted in the destruction of 20 further enemy aircraft; 13 were probably destroyed and 14 damaged. We lost 11 fighters. No important offensive operations were possible on three days owing to unsuitable weather conditions and, on another day, a large-scale sweep proved uneventful.Night. : .        . .    -45. Bomber Command despatched 675 sorties by night, compared with 736the previous week. Operations were restricted by bad weather to four nights, and during two of these conditions became rapidly unfavourable while the attacks were in progress. The main objectives were industrial and railway centres andshipyards in Germany; a total of 762 tons of H.E. bombs and over 50,000incendiaries were dropped. &quot;
46. On the first night of the period (7th/8th August), visibility was good.Eighty-four aircraft attacked Krupp&apos;s coke oven batteries at Essen, a total of108 tons of H.E. bombs and 5,720 incendiaries being released, causing numerouslarge and small fires in the target&apos; area and in the city itself. Very satisfactory results were achieved by 31 bombers in an attack on Hamm; bursts were seen on and around the marshalling yard and several aircraft reported an immensefire (probably an oil cistern) from which smoke ascended to 11,000 feet and spreadfor ten miles. Many large fires also resulted at Dortmund after an attack carriedout by 32 aircraft.47. Excellent weather over Kiel on the following night, enabled 88 aircraftaccurately to bomb the&apos; Deutsche Werke Shipyards. Of the 104 tons of H.E.bombs and 4,836 incendiaries released, a number fell directly in the centre of the target, starting many fires; a particularly large fire was also observed on thesouth side of the city. At Hamburg, however, on the same night, weather wasbad and identification of objectives was almost impossible; except for bomb-bursts and fires, no results were observed.48. After an interval of two nights, the railway centres at Munchen-Gladbach and Krefeld and the docks at Rotterdam were attacked by smallerforces of bombers; heavy cloud over the aiming points prevented observation ofany noteworthy results apart from a few fires.49. The heaviest effort of the week was made the following night, a totalof 234 aircraft being despatched. Weather conditions again proved extremelydifficult. - A number of aircraft failed to locate their targets, which, in some instances, were completely obscured by heavy cloud and severe thunderstorms.At Havre, conditions were more favourable and good fires were started on and near the docks as the result of a raid by eleven aircraft. Elsewhere the effect ofour attacks could not be assessed, though fires were reported at the followingprimary targets : Hanover, attacked by 69 aircraft, Berlin by 42,. Essen by 28and Magdeburg by 20. Bombs were dropped on a number of alternative targets in widely-separated areas by single aircraft. We lost 7 medium and 6 heavy bombers on this night&apos;s operations.50. Havocs and Spitfires carried out 18 sorties against aerodromes in enemyoccupied territory, five aerodromes being bombed and a number of fires started.Over Gilze Rijen, a Havoc on patrol sighted 20 enemy aircraft.near the aerodrome;seven of these were attacked and five are claimed to have been damaged.United Kingdom.51. Fighter Command flew 780 patrols, involving 3,086 sorties, by day, and306 patrols, involving 434 sorties, by night; the latter totals include dusk anddawn operations. The sorties flown, in particular those flown by day, show anincrease over those of last week.52. Enemy activity was on a small scale, and in general the German AirForce made little attempt to maintain an air offensive on this front.Coastal Operations.53.   Coastal Command flew 151 patrols (259 sorties) and provided escorts-for 68 convoys (183 additional sorties).   Shipping protection patrols carried outby Fighter Command totalled 633 (1,295 sorties).54. Searches were continued for enemy shipping. A number of vessels were attacked by aircraft from the three Commands. The results hf some attacks were not seen; near misses were reported in others. Reports of successful attacks were received from Hampdens, which, returning from laying sea-mines, hit anenemy vessel in the Little Belt and another off the Frisian Islands, fromBlenheims, which twice hit a 1,500-ton tanker off Gravelines causing a fireamidships and from Hurricanes, escorting the Blenheims, which set two A.A.ships on fire.   The tanker is believed to have sunk later.55. Twenty-one aircraft were despatched to lay sea-mines in Kiel Harbour,in the Western Baltic and off the South-West Coast of Norway.
56. Enemy minelaying was on a small scale. Two shipping attacks weremade in daylight, eight by night, the majority being unsuccessful.Central Mediterranean.57. Wellingtons operating from Malta made six successful night attacks on Tripoli (L), during which they dropped 42 tons of HE. bombs and over 7 tonsof incendiaries. Many large fires were reported in the town and near the power station; a direct hit on the power station during one raid caused a big explosionwhich was visible from a very long distance. Government offices, the.Governor&apos;sPalace and a heavy A.A. position were amongst other objectives hit. A railway station was destroyed and M.T. vehicles on the Benghazi road were attacked with machine-gunfire.58. During daylight on the 9th, six Blenheims made many direct hits onblockhouses and barracks at Misurata, and on ammunition and supply dumps atBeurat; these targets were either completely destroyed or blown up. Severallorries attacked on the main road were destroyed or overturned.59. Our effective attacks on Sicilian bases may have obliged the Italians tostrengthen their fighter defences in that theatre. On the 8th August, fourBlenheims despatched to attack shipping in Catania harbour were met by a patrolof 30 C.R. 42s and were obliged to abandon their task.60. Naval aircraft, operating under A.O.C., Malta, attacked Augusta onthe 9th August and hit the gasometer. On the night the 10th/11th, these aircrafthit the merchant vessel California (13,000 tons) at Syracuse with two torpedoes,It of which she was observed to have sunk in the harbour. Another nightattack by Swordfish was made on the submarine base at Augusta, resulting ina large fire on a quay; other aircraft caused a big fire in the barracks at Syracuse.Blenheims attacked and hit a French collier of 700 tons off Lampedusa, which isbelieved to have sunk.61. On the 11th August, three Blenheims attacked a chemical works atCotrone (95 miles south of Taranto); direct hits were made on tanks andcontainers, and the target was left in a mass of flames. Three other Blenheimsdestroyed buildings at Cariati, thirty miles North of Cotrone.62. Small formations of Italian long-range bombers operated over Malta on two nights during the week. On the 11th/12th August, nine aircraft were reported, two of which were shot down into the sea by Hurricane night fighters.Egypt and Cyrenaica.63. On the night 10th/11th August a heavy attack was made on Benghaziby thirty-six Wellingtons. Large bombs were used, and these were seen to fallon motor transport repair sections, railway sidings and in the dock area; large fires were observed on the quays and in the area behind the Central and Cathedralmoles. All these aircraft returned safely. On six occasions medium and heavy bombers carried out day or night raids on Bardia. Six mary lands attacked apetrol tanker in the harbour, obtaining near misses; M.T. and gun repair shopsreceived direct hits causing large fires and explosions in the workshops. Bombsalso fell among barrack buildings and the officers&apos; quarters, while hits were madeon the custom-house and on harbour buildings. It is also believed that a bombfell on a medium-sized ship.64. Fighters continued to provide patrols over our coastal shipping; two attacks by Me. 110s were driven off and one Messerschmitt was destroyed.65. On the Libyan Front, Tobruk continued to be the main target of theenemy, and Italian fighters and Ju. 87s co-operated on several occasions. mines were dropped in the harbour, and some of the bombing attacks were of a sustainednature; damage was caused to the ordnance clearance store, and an ammunitiondump and 1,100 gallons of petrol were destroyed.66. Night operations by German long-range bombers based in Greece andthe ^aegean against the Suez Canal area, were a prominent feature of the week&apos;sactivity. Attacks were carried out on six nights by forces varying from ten to twenty-five aircraft, but the damage caused - was relatively slight. Civiliandamage and casualties in Alexandria as a result of an attack on the 7th/8th
August were, however, quite considerable. Two attacks were made on the RoyalAir Force station at Abu Sueir, as a result of which several buildings and thefiltration plant were hit, and four aircraft on the ground were destroyed and eight others damaged. On the night of the 10th/11th August, the main attack was directed against American shipping in Suez Bay; three ships sustained ninenear misses, but no appreciable damage was reported.aegean.67. On the night 8th/9th August, thirty-three Wellingtons from Egyptattacked the Corinth Canal with bombs and mines and the canal will be closedf for a considerable time. As a diversion, two Wellingtons bombed Eleusisaerodrome.68. On both the 7th and 12th August, three Italian aircraft attackedFamagusta (Cyprus) and damaged a schooner laden with benzine and also somedock buildings; on the same day, the aerodrome at Nicosia (Cyprus) was bombed by five enemy aircraft, but no serious damage resulted.East Africa.69. Bombing and machine-gun attacks were maintained against Gondarand enemy positions at Wolchefit. Large fires were reported at Gondar, wheredirect hits were observed on the military head-quarters, and on large buildings and military stores. Aircraft of the South African Air Force took a prominentpart, in co-operation with the Royal Air Force, in these operations.Russia.General.70. There is still little information of Russian air operations. russian aircraft dropped eighteen parachutists over Helsinki on the night 23rd/24thJuly; fifteen are reported to have been captured. It is learnt that the recentBritish air attack on Petsamo caused considerable damage to quays, cranes andother harbour equipment.German Air Operations.71. Operations in the Northern and Central sectors of the front appear tohave been on a limited scale, accompanying the lull in land operations. Longrange bombing attacks on Moscow, however, have been carried out on severalnights with moderate forces.72. Fighters and dive-bombers have been active in the above area roundKiev and in support of the deep advance into the Ukraine, bombers andbomber reconnaissance aircraft being employed on harassing attacks on the harbour and shipping at Odessa and Nikolaiev.73. There has been little activity to report from Northern Norway apartfrom routine reconnaissance over the sea areas north of the Cape; in the Baltic,shipping and anti-submarine patrols have been continued.Air Raids on?Moscow.74. A report on air raids on Moscow has now been received from an observerwho was in Moscow between the 22nd July and the 1st August. He wasaccommodated in a building from which a good view could be cb fc ell h6 d of theair raids over part of the city. He confirms that the German air attacks seemedto be, at that time, on a small scale, and that comparatively few aircraft reachedthe centre of the city. During one raid which lasted from about 2300 hours toabout 0230 hours the following morning, the raiders seemed to arrive singly atfive-minute intervals, and the observer thinks that the Russian assertion that onlyfive aircraft flew over the city may be correct. He, himself, would have estimated the number at between 12 and 15 aircraft. The Germans declared that on another raid they sent 500 aircraft against Moscow, but the observer saw noraider appear on that occasion.75. After another raid the Russians claimed to have brought down 15aircraft, and as the members of the British Air Mission actually saw five aircraft
falling, it is considered that, because of their restricted view of the raid, theRussian figure may be a very likely total. German aircraft were seen to havebeen caught in searchlight beams and the A.A. fire from the Russian guns wasvery intense. Guns of every calibre, including machine-guns, were firedcontinuously, so that there must have been a considerable waste of ammunition.76. When air raid warnings are sounded in Moscow everybody, exceptfire-watchers, police, &amp;c, has to go to the shelters, which are of a basement ortrench type. Nevertheless, there are, apparently, plenty of people ready to dealwith fires, which confirms the statement in the Russian communiques that thepopulation have put out fires very quickly. Incendiary bombs are extinguishedwith sand as no stirrup pumps are available. The observer estimated that during his stay nothing larger than a 500-kilogramme bomb had been used. .German Estimate of Russian First-Line Air Strength.77. In a recent article in the Kolnische Zeitung, entitled &quot; Air Supremacyon the Eastern Eront,&quot; General der Flieger (Air-Marshal) Quade writes asfollows : &quot; Germany knew (when attacking Russia) that she had to deal with anumerically very much superior opponent. The last published estimate set the number of first-line aircraft in the U.S.S.R. in 1939 at 6,000. What hasbeen added since then is not known.&quot;HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.78. On the evening of the 8th August ineffective machine-gunning occurred-over Skegness.
