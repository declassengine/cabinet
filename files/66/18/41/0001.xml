naval SITUATION.General Review,1.   A cruiser force successfully engaged enemy units near the North Cape.A homebound Canadian convoy has been heavily attacked by U-boats off the east coast of Greenland; otherwise shipping casualties have been below theaverage.Home Waters.2. The Battleship Duke of York and Aircraft Carrier Indomitablehave left their builders&apos; yards for docking and completion for service.M.T.Bs. carried out an attack on enemy convoy off Cape Gris Nez on the night 8th/9th September. One 4,000-ton enemy ship was sunk and one of 3,500tons badly damaged and probably sunk. Of four supporting E-boats, one was probably sunk by depth charge. One M.T.B. was badly damaged and two M.G.Bs.in support were slightly damaged.   Our casualties were two wounded.North Atlantic.3. The U.S. Destroyer Greer, on passage to Iceland (C), with mails, wasunsuccessfully attacked by a U-boat on the 4th September when 170 miles south-west of Reykjavik. She counter-attacked with depth charges, but the result isunknown.Arctic Waters.4. On the morning of 7th September, H.M. Ships Nigeria and Auroraengaged an enemy force in Sverholthavet (east of North Cape) in foul weather and sank the German Light Cruiser Bremse, a small destroyer and two small craft, Nigeria was slightly damaged through ramming a wreck, but there were no other casualties.Mediterranean.5. H.M. Submarines have continued their attacks in the Central and eastern mediterranean. Talisman fired on two motor lighters off Benghazi on 30th August,hitting both and probably sinking one. On the same day Unbeaten torpedoed and sank a large schooner near the Straits of Messina. On the 4th September, Otusattacked a southbound convoy of 13 merchant ships 200 miles south-east ofMessina and sank a ship of the Ramb class (3,680 tons). On the 5th Perseussank the Italian Tanker Maya (3,867 tons) off the Dardanelles.In enemy air attacks during the week, H.M. Depot Ship Woohuich, H.M.Hospital Ship Maine and H.M. Destroyer Kandahar were slightly damaged bynear misses at Alexandria, one officer and 4 ratings being killed and 15 ratingswounded. H.M. Destroyers Kimberley and Decoy were also damaged by near misses while on passage to and from Tobruk.A naval operation for the reinforcement of air forces in Malta was successfully carried out.It is estimated that at least 20,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or damaged by our aircraft.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. H.M. Destroyer Croome rammed and sank the Italian U-Boat MareggiorFrancesco Baracca on 8th September between the Azores and Portugal; theRussians claim to have sunk the German U. 73 off the approach to the White Sea.Eleven attacks on U-Boats were made by aircraft, one of which claimed five hits,and seven attacks were made by surface craft, but none of these showed anyconclusive result.Enemy Intelligence.7. The pocket battleship Admiral Scheer left Oslo on the 7th september and has not since been located. The aircraft-carrier Graf Zeppelin has beenphotographed at Stettin in the Western Baltic. There is no change in theposition of other main German or Italian units.
U-Boats.Thirty or more German U-Boats have been operating in two groups in theNorth Atlantic, one about 500 miles westward of Cape Finisterre and the otheroff south-eastern Greenland. Six of the latter are estimated to have attacked ahomeward convoy close to Cape Farewell. Four others have been operating tothe northward of the Cape Verde Islands. Apart from the attack on an ItalianU-Boat, already referred to, there have been no other indications of ItalianU-Boat activity.Raiders.It is estimated that there are at present two, possibly three, raiders in theSouth Atlantic, one in the Indian Ocean, and possibly one in the Pacific.Black Sea.There are indications of a possible German sea-borne expedition in the black Sea against Russia or perhaps against Turkey. Twenty-five thousandGerman sailors are said to be in Bulgarian ports.Other Intelligence.Japan.8. The main units of the Japanese Fleet are all concentrated in their homeports.Russian.At least 5 large submarines and one modern destroyer were passed throughthe White Sea Canal between the end of July and the middle of August. TheGermans claim that the Finnish armies have now cut the Canal, but this is notconfirmed.A merican.The Commander-in-Chief of the United States Atlantic Fleet has been directed to destroy any surface raiders which attack or threaten shipping betweenAmerica and Iceland (C).Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade,9. A heavy attack on a homeward bound convoy was made by several U-boats off the East coast of Greenland on the 10th/11th September. Details have notyet been received, but seven or more ships are known to have been torpedoed. one ship had been sunk in this area earlier in the week. Two ships havebeen sunk by enemy aircraft in the Irish Sea and two off the east coast,,and one American ship was sunk in the Gulf of Suez. Two ships were sunk byE-Boat off the Norfolk coast and one ship by mine off Spurn Point.The shipping losses in August (details of which are given in Appendix I)were 30 ships and 5 small craft, totalling 107,662 tons, of which 21 and 5 small craft (77,719 tons) were British. This total is 34,197 tons lower than in theprevious month. Twenty-one ships and two small craft (80,310 tons) were sunk by U-boat, principally in the Western Approaches and in the Azores-Portugalarea, one ship and two small craft (1,400 tons) by mines in the Thames Estuarv,three ships (10,841 tons) by surface craft (one by raider off Galapagos Islands)and five ships and one small craft (15,111 tons) by aircraft. In addition,14 ships and five small craft, totalling 53,668 tons, which are included inAppendix I, were reported in August but lost in previous months.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending 10th September 832 ships, including 139 allied and 24 neutral, were convoyed. Four anti-aircraft ships, seven armed merchant cruisers, 71 destroyers and 96 sloops, corvettes and Fleet minesweepers were employed on convoy duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending6th September totalled 708,151 tons, compared with 819,275 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 858,293 tons during the past ten weeks.[22904] B
There were, in addition, two shiploads of about 14,000 tons of Special Govern-ment Cargo. Oil imports in 34 tankers amounted to 353,896 tons, compared with218,863 tons in 21 tankers during the previous week. Mineral imports were167,485 tons, of which 111,186 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. The corresponding figures for the previous seven days were 207,562 tonsand 105,439 tons. Wood and pulp imports were 27,855 tons, and cereal imports50,040 tons, six ships being fully laden with grain or flour. Other food importscame to 63,367 tons, of which the principal commodities, in tons, were:Refrigerated and tinned meat 10,329, sugar 9,821, lard and fats 5,384, evaporatedmilk 3,219, dried and tinned fruit 2,821, tea 2,452, butter 2,252, cheese 618, jam412. There were also 4,304 tons of unspecified tin food. Two consignments of tobacco totalled 902 tons. Among imports of machinery were 645 tons of machine tools, and there were satisfactory quantities of ammunition and other war stores.British Minelaying.11. Mines have been laid off Stadlandet by H.M.S. Manxman and off NorthRona by HM. Ships Port Quebec and Agamemnon. Minelaying has also been continued by M.T.Bs. off the Belgian coast, and by aircraft in the Baltic, BalticApproaches and off the Frisian coast and French Biscayan ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.12. Minelaying by enemy aircraft has been reported on three nights onlyduring this past week. On&apos; the night 4th/5th September about 20 enemy aircraft were operating off the Tyne and Tees, five off the Humber and one or twomachines were thought to be minelaying off Dover, Dungeness, and milford haven. Two nights later, minelaying was suspected in the Bristol Channel, andon the night of 9th/10th September off Milford Haven and the Tyne.Twenty magnetic and nine acoustic mines have been detonated during theweek, of which eight were off the Humber, five off the Tyne, four off milford haven and three in the Barrow Deep. The mine totals, including those dealtwith in Foreign Waters, are 1,394 magnetic, 938 acoustic, and 1,033 contact mines.Foreign Waters.The Suez Canal area was raided during the nights of 4th/5th and 5th/6thSeptember and mines have been dropped in Suez Bay. Sections of the Canalwere closed for two days following the first nights raid. The Canal is nowopen to traffic.Enemy Shipping.Northern Waters.13. According to the Stockholm press two German tankers carrying cargoes of petrol recently blew up off Bergen, probably as the result of sabotage.The German Donau, 9,035 tons, and Bahia Laura, 8,561 tons, are reported tohave been sunk off Loppahaust, some sixty miles north-east of Tromso, with theloss of about 1,700 men. H.M.S. Trident attacked an eastbound convoy there on30th August [Resume No. 105, para. 3).It. is reported that the liner Bremen, which was burnt out in March, is nowbeing broken up.A new quay for the loading of nickel is reported to have been completed atKirkenes. Port extension works are known to have been in progress for some time.The Mediterranean and Adriatic.Two German ships are reported to have left Garrucha recently with iron orefor Germany via Marseilles; the Lisbon, 1,799 tons, left on the 24th August with3,050 tons of iron ore, and the Hans Schmidt, 4,427 tons, left on 3rd September
MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.15. Operations during the past week include a Finnish advance east of lake Ladoga and some progress by German forces advancing on Leningrad fromthe south, thus virtually completing the encirclement of the city; a successful butapparently local Russian counter-attack south-east of Smolensk; further progressby German infantry operating south of Gomel; and the establishment by theGermans of two further bridgeheads over the River Dnieper at Kremenchug andBerislav. Fighting has been fierce at the Dniepropetrovsk bridgehead, whichthe Germans do not appear to have enlarged appreciably.Finland.16. There is no news of any operations in the far north or in the Sallasector. On the 7th September the Finns reported having advanced in the area east of Lake Ladoga as far as the River Svir, which flows from Lake Onega toLake Ladoga and forms part of the Stalin-White Sea Canal. The point reached on the river is believed to be approximately due south-east of Olonets, but the murmansk-Leningrad railway running south of the river has not been cut.No further advance has been made by Finnish troops on the KarelianIsthmus, and there are no reports of operations at Hangb, which remains in russian hands.Leningrad Sector.\ 17.   Fierce fighting has continued and the situation from the Russian pointof view is extremely serious. German motorised forces have reachedSchlusselburg, on Lake Ladoga, and it is believed that this advance has been sufficiently consolidated to cut all land communications between Leningrad andthe rest of Russia.Central Front.18. The Russians have launched a counter-attack, well supported by theRussian Air Force, south-east of Smolensk and have retaken Yelnya.[22904] b 2with 6,960 tons of iron ore. The A tlas, 2,297 tons, left Barcelona on 3rd Septemberwith a cargo of pyrites which she had loaded at Valencia and arrived at Genoa6th September.In the Italian press last month it was stated that the Morea, 1,968 tons, was sunk by submarine on 16th August, 1940, while returning from Durazzo toBrindisi. The sinking of the Catalani, 2,429 tons, in the Adriatic during thewar with Greece was also confirmed.vichy French Shipping.14. During the month of August 35 ships, totalling 153,000 tons, are reported to have passed Gibraltar eastbound, and 30 ships, totalling 108,000tons, to have passed Gibraltar westbound without submitting to any contraband control. Five of those which passed into the Mediterranean were Allied orNeutral ships (12,000 tons) which are now sailing under the French flag.Sixteen of the ships which passed Gibraltar westwards during July and august (86,000 tons) were loaded with war material, and further shipmentshave been made from Marseilles via Oran for onward transport by rail toCasablanca.S.S. Gazcon (4,131 tons) was intercepted by H.M.S. Albatross about 200 miles south-west of Takoradi on the 7th September, and was taken into Lagos. Shewas homeward bound from Madagascar.
The objective of this counter-attack was probably the Smolensk-Bryanskrailway, which, as far as Roslavl, is an important line of communication for theGermans, but there is no news of any appreciable Russian advance westwardsfrom Yelnya.Ukraine.19. Fierce fighting by German infantry has continued along the general lineof the River Desna from west of Glukhov to north of Chernigov, which is in russian hands.Apart from the fact that the Germans are believed to have crossed the rivereast of Chernigov, the situation in this sector has remained unchanged.20. There is no news of the fighting around Kiev itself, but a bridgeheadover the River Dnieper has been gained at Kremenchug, whence a considerable advance northwards is reported.21. Fierce fighting has continued at the Dniepropetrovsk bridgehead, wherevery strong Russian resistance has prevented any appreciable enlargement of the bridgehead by the Germans.22. A third bridgehead over the River Dnieper has been established by theGermans at Berislav and some progress southwards has been made.Conclusions.23. There is no doubt that the situation on the Eastern Front has become more serious during the past week, in spite of fierce Russian counter-attacksnear Smolensk and stubborn resistance in the Chernigov area and along the RiverDnieper, particularly at Dniepropetrovsk.J24. The relative stabilisation of the Smolensk front, the pause in the driveby German mechanised forces in the Glukhov area and the period of securing thebridgeheads over the River Dnieper have given a large proportion of the german armoured and motorised forces a certain respite and should have allowed consoli-dation of the supply position, particularly in the Ukraine.25. A fresh drive by German mechanised forces will probably not be very long delayed, and the most serious form this could take would probably be a drivesouthwards from the Gulkhov area, with the object of enveloping Kiev and out-flanking the Dnieper defences. This might coincide with a northward drive fromthe Kremendhug bridgehead. A similar drive southwards from the Berislavbridgehead to block road communications between the Crimea and the Ukrainemight also develop.Operations.Persia.26. During the week our advanced troops in Northern Persia reachedSultanabad (Iraq), Aveh and Senna. Contact was made with the Russian forcesat various points. Minor operations have taken place against armed bands of persian soldiers led by rebel officers and numbers of rifles have been taken.27. The Persian Government accepted the Anglo-Soviet terms on the9th September and, apart from frontier trouble between the Khurds and the persians on tihe Iraq-Persia frontier west of Senna, the situation is quiet.Iraq.28.   Further reinforcements have arrived in Iraq from the Middle East.Intelligence.France and Spain.29. Reports of train movements suggest that three German divisions moved into France from Germany at the end of August. It is possible that an armoured division may now be in France.
In view of reports of the movement of troops to the eastern front from the rhineland, the reported move of divisions into France may represent relief s ratherthan reinforcements. It is still estimated therefore that there are only fiveinfantry divisions between Angouleme and the Spanish frontier; an additionalarmoured division may have arrived.Balkan States. .30. The total number of German divisions in the Balkans (includingHungary and Slovakia) is now believed to be 12. Of these there are probablythree or four in Bulgaria, two at least being in the Varna-Bourgas area.31. It seems likely that these last divisions at least may be intended for a combined operation in the Black Sea, probably against South Russia. Therehave been reports that the Germans have collected a number of barges and other small craft in Black Sea ports, and German naval personnel in increasing numbers are stated to have arrived recently in Varna.32. There is little indication that any of the above preparations are directed against Turkey, and they are more likely to be intended for a sea-borne operation against the Crimea or the eastern shores of the Black Sea.AIR SITUATION.General Review.33. Our bombers were unable to operate on three nights owing to extensivecoastal and inland fog. Conditions on the remaining nights enabled attacks inforce to be carried out against important objectives; these attacks included the heaviest raids on Berlin and Turin. By day, operations were restricted byunsuitable weather.Enemy activity over this country remained at a low level.Germany, Northern Italy and Occupied Territory.Day.34. Bomber Command despatched 57 sorties, compared with 103 last week,and dropped 21 tons of H.E. bombs and a few incendiaries. Offensive operations by Fighter Command involved 482 aircraft sorties, of which 315 took place on one day. Poor visibility severely restricted daylight activities, although when condi-tions permitted anti-shipping operations were carried out as recorded under&quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;35. Blenheims, escorted by fighters, made attacks on Cherbourg, where hits were obtained on the docks and on a Synthetic Oil Plant at Mazingarbe, bombsfalling on the ammonia plant, coke ovens and a railway siding. On the6th September three Fortresses were despatched to attack the Admiral Scheerat Oslo, and, failing to locate the pocket battleship, bombed the dockside. two days later, four more Fortresses were despatched against the same target, but were intercepted at 28,000 feet by a formation of Me. 109&apos;s, which shot downtwo of them and severely damaged a third.36. On the only occasion when a large-scale operation by fighters waspossible, 27 Squadron sorties were flown; eight enemy aircraft were destroyed,11 probably destroyed and five damaged. We lost eight fighters, the pilot ofone being rescued. Three squadrons of fighters engaged in an offensive sweeplater in the week encountered considerable opposition, four Spitfires being shot down; enemy casualities were one destroyed and. one damaged.Night.37. Bomber Command despatched 600 sorties, compared with 894 in theprevious week. The main attacks were carried out with considerable effect undergood conditions, but on three nights no operations were possible owing tounsuitable weather.
38. The principal objectives were industrial and railway centres and shipbuilding yards. A total of 534 tons of H.E. bombs and 48,000 incendiarieswas released.39. The week&apos;s offensive operations opened with an attack, in excellentweather, on Chemical Works at Hiils, near Krefeld. In spite of heavy A.A.fire and many enemy night fighters, the raid was successfully completed, andbombs were observed to burst on the target and near the power station.40. On the following night, 295 bombers were despatched, including thelargest number of our aircraft that has, up to the present, attacked Berlin atany time. About 140 tons of H.E. bombs and over 12,000 incendiaries were released on Berlin. Visibility was exceptionally good and large fires, many ofwhich could be seen from a considerable distance, were started in industrial and railway centres and in the centre of the capital. Three 4,000-lb. bombs explodedeast of Alexander Platz and other bombs fell on Unter den Linden and on a railway bridge across the Spree. Fires were seen near the Wannsee andFriedrichstrasse railway stations, at Kopenick, Templehof Aerodrome, Frank-furter Strasse and at a camouflaged factory 20 miles from the city. Seventeen ofour aircraft were lost on this operation.41. On the same night, the Deutsche Werke shipyards at Kiel and ware-houses at Boulogne were successfully attacked by strong forces of bombers, fromwhich three aircraft are missing. At Kiel, big explosions resulted and at bothplaces numerous fires broke out.42. The following night, the Henschel Armament Factory and LocomotiveWorks at Kassel were the objectives. Visibility was again good and some of the75 attacking aircraft came down to 400 feet before releasing their bombs. Theland armament workshops received a direct hit, which was followed by a largeexplosion; a stick of bombs fell across the railway locomotive works and fires were started in the adjoining railway centre. When our aircraft (all of whichreturned safely) left the target, the town appeared to contain a large numberof fires.43. On the night of the 10th/11th September 76 Bomber Command aircraft(including 20 heavy bombers) were despatched to attack the Royal Arsenal and railway centres at Turin; 66 tons of HE. bombs and 2,400 incendiaries, includingnearly 500 of 40 lbs. or 50 lbs., were dropped. Weather conditions were moderatelyfavourable, and many aircraft reported a very large fire in the Arsenal, whereexplosions were seen to throw debris high into the air. In addition many fires were reported in the town, and one particularly large building burningfuriously. Between Annecy and Geneva, &quot; V &quot; was flashed from the ground inred, white and blue, and was acknowledged by a Wellington. From this operationthree Wellingtons and one Halifax are missing.44. During the week, aircraft of Bomber Command destroyed four enemynight fighters, probably destroyed a fifth and damaged another.United Kingdom.45. Fighter Command flew a total of 1,862 sorties by day, and 344 sortiesby night; the latter totals include dusk and dawn operations.Enemy operations against this country have been on a small scale and attacks have been widely dispersed. Long-range bomber and reconnaissance aircraft operated both by day and by night, but few of these penetrated overland.Coastal Operations.46. Coastal Command flew 233 patrols (366 sorties) and provided 42 convoy-escorts (127 additional sorties). Snipping protection patrols carried out by fighter Command totalled 497 (1,030 sorties).Throughout the week aircraft of the three Commands continued their operations against enemy shipping. Blenheims of Bomber Command destroyeda 1,200-ton Flak ship off the Hague, and a barge, in convoy near the channel islands, was hit. Coastal Command aircraft, operating off the Norwegian coast,torpedoed a 5,000-ton merchant vessel, and another of 6,000 tons is believed tohave been hit. In an attack on Bergso Island bombs fell on the Harbour andthe fish oil factory was set alight.
47. In addition to providing escorts for anti-shipping operations, our fighters destroyed a Flak ship near Ostend; damaged another off Boulogne; hita 1,000-ton ship off Haamstede; and carried out attacks on a coastguard stationnear Barfleur, and on a wireless station near Cape de la Hague. Numerous other attacks were made, the results of which were inconclusive or unobserved, and several near misses against shipping were reported.48.   Thirty-eight aircraft were despatched to lay sea-mines off Oslo, Lorient,St. Nazaire, the Frisian Islands and in the Western Baltic.49. Enemy minelaying on a small scale was suspected between the Lizardand Falmouth on the night of the 6th/7th, and on the same night an attack wasmade against shipping off Lowestoft.Central Mediterranean.50. On the 4th September five Blenheims attacked ships in Cotrone, whichhad taken refuge there as a result of a very successful attack made by Swordfishthe previous night, and reported in last week&apos;s Resume. One merchant vessel of6-8,000 tons was hit and an explosion resulted, and two other ships were attackedbut the results were not observed. One Blenheim was shot down by A.A. guns.On the night of the 6th/7th September, seven Naval Swordfish, operating underA.O.C., Malta, intercepted a northbound convoy of three merchant vessels andthree destroyers; one vessel of 6,000 tons was hit three times and almost certainlysunk, and a tanker of 6,000 tons was twice hit with torpedoes.51. A total of 34 tons of bombs was dropped on two nights by Wellingtonson Tripoli (L). The first attack was made on M.T. depots in conditions ofexcellent visibility. The attack was pressed home from a very low level;all the bombs fell in the target area, where large fires among vehicles and buildings were reported. The harbour was the objective of the second attack; threehits were obtained on a medium-sized merchant vessel, and a number of bombsfell on the Spanish Quay.52. On two successive nights Wellingtons from Malta attacked the docks at Palermo and dropped a total of 32 tons of bombs. Many hits were made onthe three main quays and dry dock, and some extensive fires were started. Threelarge merchant vessels lying in the harbour at the time of the attack may also have suffered damage. These attacks were followed by two night raids by a totalof 16 Wellingtons on the power station, landing stages and ferry ships at Messina;over 22 tons of bombs were dropped and many hits were obtained on the targets.A big fire was reported in the Citadel        of the town.53. On the 4th September a daylight raid on Malta was attempted by a force of 20 Macchi 200s, which were intercepted by Hurricanes at sea. later in the day 12 more Macchi 200s were employed to cover rescue operations. Inthe course of these two operations nine of the enemy fighters were destroyed, twoprobably destroyed and five others damaged, against our loss of two Hurricanes.54. Formations of from one to six aircraft have attacked Malta on mostnights of the week. The few bombs dropped have caused negligible damage.One Cant. Z1007 was illuminated by searchlights and shot down in flames by hurricanes.Egypt and Cyrenaica.55. One night attack was made by 15 Wellingtons on Benghazi, and hits were made on military stores. A heavier raid was carried out against Barce,where the targets bombed included the railway sidings, workshops, barracks andthe aerodrome. A series of attacks was made on enemy aerodromes in Libya.At Derna six enemy aircraft were probably destroyed on the ground, and atCapuzzo one large aircraft was destroyed and a big fire was started at the petroldump. By day seven mary lands, escorted by fighters, successfully bombed stores and dumps near Gambut, and another attack by nine mary lands was made onheavy guns east of Tobruk.
56. Enemy night operations were carried out by forces of from 15 to 26aircraft. Attacks were made each night in the Suez area, particularly againstaerodromes, where considerable damage resulted. At Ismailia one hangar and several buildings, including the officers&apos; quarters, were destroyed, and elevenaircraft were damaged. At Abu Sueir five hangars, living quarters, and oneWellington were destroyed, and an oil dump set on fire. Both aerodromes were rendered unserviceable by craters and unexploded bombs. Two raiders were shot down and four others damaged.Another attack by 26 aircraft was made on Suez on the 7th/8th Septemberwhen bombs fell in the anchorage, in the canal, and near oil refineries. No damage was reported to shipping or to property, but one of our ships was damaged two nights later. During an attack on Alexandria by nine aircraft, bombs were dropped over a wide area, and caused some damage, but not of a serious nature.57. In daylight on the 7th September Italian fighters attacked Sidi Barraniaerodrome and destroyed four of our fighters on the ground and damaged sevenothers. Numerous small raids took place on Tobruk without causing much damage and only negligible casualties.Greece.58. On the night of the 8th/9th 23 Wellingtons from Egypt attacked theCorinth Canal. Hits were made on both banks and many bombs fell into the canal.   One aircraft bombed the aerodrome at Heraklion (Crete).Five Wellingtons also dropped nine boxes of food supplies for propaganda purposes.Russia.Russian Air Operations.59. Reports received indicate that the chief function of the Soviet AirForce has been close support to their ground troops, for which they have two typesspecially designed. These are the I.L. 2, a single-engined storm aircraft, and theP.E. 2 twin-engined dive-bomber.60. In addition to army co-operation, Soviet airmen have been co-operating in the &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy advocated by Stalin by dropping incendiary bombs upon crops, villages and forests.61. In general, there is evidence to show that the Soviet Air Force is stillfighting effectively, and it is believed that supplies and replacements are reaching the units satisfactorily.German Air Operations.62. On a front of such length, which cannot be defended in equal strength at all points, the value of reconnaissance is particularly marked, and the ability of the German Air Force to locate the weak points has undoubtedly contributedgreatly to the success of the Panzer thrusts.63. In accordance with the usual German practice, the fighter and dive-bomber units have concentrated on close support of the Army m the areas ofgreatest pressure, i.e., the Leningrad, Gomel and Lower Dnieper districts. Thishas, no doubt, diminished the difficulties of supply, which must be veryconsiderable, but it has also necessitated the absence of fighter protection anddive-bomber support over large parts of the front, and the lack of dispersal hasrendered the aerodromes used by the German Air Force more vulnerable to air attack. The Russians appear to have exploited these two weaknesses in theGerman air offensive with some success.&apos; 64. The scale of attack by long range bombers on Moscow has steadilydiminished and the principal bombing objectives now appear to be Russian aero-dromes, troop concentrations and communications. Particular attention is being paid to railway lines and bridges in the rear of the main Russian concentrations,out there is no evidence that Russian troop movements have been seriouslydisorganised.
65. Coastal units have been very active in the Baltic and in the Black sea and have played an important part in restricting Russian submarine activity and in locating Russian naval units and supply ships.66. It is difficult to give any reliable figures for aircraft losses. Repair andsalvage units follow close behind the front and, whilst subject to air attack,maintain a fair level of serviceability in units, considering the rate of advance.It is thought, however, that the serviceability of the German Air Force units isnow not more than 50 per cent, of their strength.Far East.Japanese Air Operations in China.67. There has been a reduction in the number of Japanese aircraft stationed in French Indo-China, and it appears that the Japanese have decided, for thepresent, to direct their main air effort in attacks on Chinese vital centres from central China bases, where they have concentrated a heavy bomber forceestimated at 240.68. The much-bombed city of Chungking, headquarters of Chiang Kai-shekand his Government, has been the chief target and appears to have been attackedboth by day and night, whenever weather conditions have been favourable. In-the attack of the 30th August as many as 162 heavy bombers, flying in sixformations of 27 aircraft, took part. Night raids have also been carried out on several occasions, but on a smaller scale, the maximum number of aircraftreported being nine in three flights of three.69. Most of the raiding on Chungking has been carried out by naval heavy bombers based on Hankow. These appear to follow the River Yangtze from theirbase and to approach Chungking from the north, flying at from 10,000 to15,000 feet in V formation, each group consisting of 27 aircraft.70. The Japanese claim to have dropped 10,000 bombs on Chungkingbetween the 8th and 14th August, which is equal to the total quantity of bombs dropped in all previous raids during this year.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.71.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : &apos;Germany.Berlin. In the raid on the 12th/13th August the windows of the exhibition-tion halls in Charlottenburg were blown in. These halls were in use as grainstores and the glass has mixed with the grain.Karlsruhe. In the first week of August the power station was damaged and the town was virtually without electricity for five days. The administrativeoffices and waiting rooms at the main station were severely damaged and railway services dislocated for three days. The Schloss Hotel and a large food store inthe York Strasse were destroyed. The population are said to be discontentedwith the A.R.P. arrangements and nervous of future attacks. Four officialshelters caved in and very few of the inmates escaped.Hannover. In the raid of the 14th/15th July the main building of the chemical laboratory at the high school (which was used for experimental work on new explosives) was hit and three-quarters burnt out. Damage was severe in theCharlotten Strasse.General. The effect on the morale of the public of the &apos;&apos; Fortress &apos;&apos; attacksis serious as the first notice of their presence is usually the arrival of the bombsthemselves.A correspondent writes on the 24th July : &apos;&apos; The day before yesterday I hadto go to Cologne on business.   I was staggered to see this town, formerly so full.of joie-de-vivre and high spirits, after the violent air raids of early July.   the damage to buildings, furniture, merchandise, &amp;c, is estimated at 300 million marks.&quot;Holland.Rotterdam. Photographs taken on the 1st September, 1941, show that as aresult of a daylight raid on the 28th August a cargo vessel of the Noordam type,of about 10,000 tons, is lying on her side in shallow water. The engine shops and assembly hall at Wilton&apos;s shipbuilding yard have been severely damaged and awarehouse nearby damaged by fire.France.Cherbourg. Photographs taken during the daylight attack on the4th September show bursts across dock No. 3 and a quayside to the east. Twovessels in the dock may well have suffered some damage.Mazingarbe.

Photographs taken on the 31st August, 1941, during a daylight attack show bombs bursting on the runway of the aerodrome and to the norththereof.General. Three pilots recently escaped from France have stated that thePotez Aircraft Factory has been very severely damaged and that when they werem the Roubaix area all coal mines were idle owing to lack of power. Otherreports tell of reduced output of coal and a complete stoppage of all work in the shipbuilding yard at Le Trait for several days, due to hits on the works powercentre and the cutting of electric cables in the yard. The destruction of the machine tool department has caused further difficulties.
Leaflet Raids.Considerable encouragement is to be found in the growing evidenceof the success of the propaganda operations carried out by Royal Air Forceleaflet raids.Despite the reduction in activity due to unfavourable weather, very satis-factory results were achieved during August, when the distribution was asfollows : Leaflets.Over Germany    .........      ...      4,557,200Over FranceOver BelgiumOver HollandOver NorwayTotal1,946,0001,650,9501,309,50018,0009,481,650The dropping of bogus ration cards has in particular created confusion,especially as it occurred at a time when the authorities had for various reasons,been obliged to, extend the period of availability from 31st August to 30thSeptember.   This operation is regarded as having been an outstanding success.During the month under review there has been no definite evidence of theeffect of the. &quot; Luftpost &quot; or other leaflets on Germany, but remembering thatthere is proof of listening on a considerable scale to British broadcasts in German,to counter which a special talk was recently given by Dr. Goebbels, it can beassumed that equal interest is shown, in the various items, of news contained in successive, editions of the &quot; Luftppst.&quot;There is continued evidence of the excellent results achieved by air-bprnepropaganda in maintaining morale and the will to resist in occupied countries.The tea-bags are particularly welcome in Holland, while the following information from Occupied; France proves the value, of &apos;&apos; Le Courrier de 1&apos;Air &quot; and otherleaflets :-(a) &apos;&apos; Propaganda leaflets, have had excellent effects on workers in BrestRegion.&quot;(b) &quot; Our leaflets had a tremendous effect on the French, population, and wereeagerly lpokecl for every morning after any of our planes, had been, over.The Germans were very much down on this, but were unable to preventthese leaflets going the rounds of the village.&quot;(c) &quot;Leaflets dropped in Brittany and Normandy were collected and circu;lated among the local population.&quot;
