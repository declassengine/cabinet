The 1940 supplementary programme and the 1941 new construction programme together provided for the laying down of the followingsubmarines s -MineSaClass       T Class U Class        Layers TOTAL30 27 12 5 74Since the 1941 programme was approved by the War Cabinet on the224-th April (W0M3 (41) 43rd Conclusions , Item 5) the developmentof the war has made it necessary to review the whole of our plans of submarine constructions,Loss of Production due to enemy action,2,     On the one hand the increasing scale of enemy attacks on our shipping have inevitably thrown a greater burden on repairs on thewest coast where the principal submarine building yards are situated,and the needs of our import programmes have made it necessary to giveprecedence to repairs over new construction.     At the same time, theGerman Air Force launched a number of heavy attacks on the west coastshipbuilding centres9 and two of the yards specialising in submarines,at Barrow and Greenock, suffered considerable damage.     Much dislocationwas also caused by widespread damage to the homes of the workers.Consequentlys it became apparent that the resources on which we hadbeen relying would not be able to achieve the full submarine programme in spite of the vigorous efforts made to maintain production.     It was estimated that within the period covered by the 192+0 supplementary and1941 programmes, the number of submarines which could be laid down ifexisting plans remained unaltered, would be as follows?&quot;MineSeClasSc     TjiClass,     Uffl Class 3       Layers e       TOTAL27 19 12 5 63Need for Expansion of Submarine Strengths..i-.aeji]Mi,j   i,.....-1   iMjuiiariMwtWi    i jiidlii pi   ii   hub mm   mi 11 n:   i -i   M n&quot;    ici. ngj lit     .     ir     i.     n -mp   l,      1&apos;iwaMft.lip bbB5, - While enemy action was reducing our capacity at home, enemystrategy in other spheres, - and especially the Mediterranean - was increasing his dependence on sea-borne supplies, with a correspondingneed - to which the Prime Minister drew attention - for the expansionof our own submarine strength in order to exploit these newpossibilities of striking at the enemy,4.     Exceptional steps to this end were therefore clearly called for,and the Admiralty, at the request of the Prime Minister, have justcompleted an investigation designed to discover new resources forsubmarine building and to obtain greater numbers of submarines from existing capacityaSgpansion of Capacitye5o     It will be appreciated that it is not easy to find new capacity,partly because of the heavy strain already imposed on our wholeshipbuilding resources by Mercantile and Naval work, and partly because submarine construction is a highly specialised business

requiring, for success , special technique and unusual experience.It has, however, been possible to bring into this field a yard ofthe Tyne which was engaged on submarine construction during thelast war.     This yard, which will undertake the smaller U Classvessels, will be helped by Barrow, and fitting-out will be accelerated by using men at Elswick who will become available from heavy gun mountings,,     It is also proposed to transfer fromBarrow to other yards material prepared for seven S Class submarinesof the 19u1 supplementary programme.     This will enable Barrow to concentrate on two types, the T. Class and U.Class.     Furthermore,two of the Royal Dockyards, not previously engaged in submarineconstruction, will each undertake two T.Class vessels.Review of Composition of Existing Programmes.6.     Simultaneously, the layout of existing programmes has been reviewed in order to obtain greater numbers by reducing the moredifficult types and increasing those which can be built more quickly.     The mine-laying submarines will not be built at all.Revised Programme.7.      As a result of these measures, it is now proposed to substitute,for the submarines of the 19*4-0 supplementary and the 191+1 programmesshown in paragraph 1 above9 the following; -MineS.Class. T.Class.        U.Class. Layers TOTAL22 30 2k None 76In addition it is proposed to proceed with engines for three S.Classsubmarines to form a reserve.Effect of Revised Programme.8.     It will be seen that by these changes we shall not merelyoffset the loss of production due to enemy attack, but shall evenlay down two more submarines than were contemplated in the originalprogrammes.     Moreover, by increasing the proportion of smaller andmore easily constructed vessels, we shall, in many eases, obtainearlier delivery varying between three to twelve months.     TheAdmiralty are, of course, doing their best at the same time to speedup work on all submarines, and once INDOMITABLE is completed at Barrow,we hope to be able to put more men on to submarines,Financial Effect.9e     These changes, for which I ask Cabinet approval, will also lead toa saving of about  870,000 although the money will, of course, be spentmore quickly.     It will also be possible, in later programmes, to ordermore submarines than would have been the case had the original intentionsbeen followed.Submarines from U0S.A.10.   I should add that we have also been trying to obtain submarinesquickly from America.     I doubt, however, whether any considerablereinforcement will be available from this source, as the only submarineswhich the Americans have agreed to provide are so old that it isdoubtful whether it would be economical to employ highly trained and valuable personnel in order to use them for operational purposes.Admiralty, S.W.1.August 22, 19U1*A.V.A
