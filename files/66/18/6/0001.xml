THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.1SDST SECRET.CT.(pTT 163. copy no2*&quot;31st July&quot;, fgVUATTACKS ON CROPS ATOP FORESTS.Memorandum by the^Secretary^ of J3tate /for Air,1.       The T/Jar Cabinet may wish to be informed of our intentions in regard tothe burning of German crops and forests^(A) CROPS,2.       The burning of crops by incendiary bomb attacks is a difficult operation.The essential weather conditions are a high wind following a prolonged spell ofdry weather.     Even under these conditions experiments carried out in this country have shown that it is extremely difficult to achieve satisfactory results.3.       Daylight attacks on German crops would also be necessary since the effectof night attacks would be greatly restricted by dew.     Day attacks on the scalenecessary to achieve results must, however, be ruled out owing to the impractica-bility of providing fighter escort at the distances involved.k-.       A further objection to such attacks is the extremely small proportion ofthe 90 million acres under crop in Germany which lies within range of our bombers.Even if effective fires could be produced it would not be possible to produce amarked effect on the food situation in Germany next winter.5.       In these circumstances, it is not intended that the Royal Air force should undertake incendiary attacks on German crops.6.       The foregoing arguments do not eliminate the possibility of German attacksa.gainst British crops,..     Large axe as of East Anglia and Lincolnshire, where aconsiderable proportion of our corn is grown, are well within range of German.bombers with fighter escort e     The precautions which have been taken in thiscountry to establish a force of watchers and fire fighters in country districtsare therefore considered to be justified,(B) FORESTS.7*       The best time for forest burning is from March to May according tostatistics on the incidence of forest fires.     Attacks on Gentian forests couldnot, however, be undertaken earlier   this year, as Bomber Command could not sparethe. necessary effort from their other commitments, notably the Battle of the atlantic,8.       The most profitable targets would be dense firwoods and heath plantedwith firs.     The former are much used for concealment of military objectives, andthe latter for military training.     The best area.s within reach are the ThuringerWald, the Harz Mountains, and the Luneburger Heide,     In August we could reach thefir forests near Berlin and Leipzig,9.       For effective results it would be necessary to employ about 200 bomberson each area, in order to swamp the local fire-fighting arrangements.     As withcrop burning, the necessar3-r weather conditions are high wind, following a. spell oficy weather.
10.     Any attack on forests must of course involve a corresponding diversionfrom industrial and other targets.     Nevertheless, the Air Staff consider the effort y/ould be justified, provided the weather is favourable and the circum-stances at the time enable the effort to be spared.     Subject to these conditions,the A.0.C.-in-C has accordingly been instructed to take the first good opportunity that presents itself for a heavy attack.A.H.M.S.AIR MINISTRY,
