cypher telegram0Prom the Government of theCOMMONWEALTH OF australia to DOMINIONS OFFICE,.Received 5th September,;  1941., 9C 20 p, m0immediate;No0   585 most secret.Following for Prime Minister;.lo      Reference your 607c.    I am grateful for theinformative survey of the constitutional and other considerations involved in the question of a Minister fromone part of the Empire participating in the work andmembership of a Cabinet in another part,    I would reciprocatethe exchange of views by outlining the Australian side, of the,question as I see it,..20      The machinery for the higher direction of war was discussed,, with many other matters relating to theEmpire and local defence,   during the Imperial Conference 1937.It is regretted that,   for reasons which need not be traversed,these discussions were possible on a two party basis only.MemorjEuadum received from the&apos;Committee of Imperial Defence,Which it was understood had the endorsement of the Minister&apos;&quot;&quot;representing the United Kingdom Government,  refers for want of a better title to an &quot;Imperial War Cabinet&quot; and to measures to be taken on the outbreak of war to consider whatmachinery along these lines is necessaryQ    Memorandum states    v&quot;The arrangement under which the High Commission/of three   &apos; eof the Dominions attend some of the meetings of/the Committeeof Imperial Defence (on which the Government of India ispermanently represented) appears to lend itself to extensionfrom the outset of a major war in such manner and in suchdegree as the Governments of the Dominions may themselves decideA1! each case&quot;0I can see no difference in principle betweenrepresentation of a Dominion by a High Commission at theCommittee of Imperial  Defence in peace time when matters affecting it are under discussion and representation at theWar Cabinet by a Minister for similar, purposes,,    The factthat the despatch of a Minister to London has the support ofthe Opposition gives his mission Parliamentary endorsement.I assume from paragraph 8 of your cable that you would welcome the presence of an Australian Minister in the War Cabinet when matters relating to higher policy&apos;, operations or other questions which affect the Australian war effort or theAustralian forces were beine- considered.    If so, we are infir.ll agreement.

4.      I would make the following detailed, oommen-taon certain paragraphs of your telegram and in view of the.,,personal and secret nature of the message they will hequite frank so that we may each he aware of the otherTsmind:-I agree that the representative who can speak with the best authority is the Prime Minister hut theDominion interests he would represent would be the samein the case of a Minister.    If the presence of theAustralian   Prime Minister is not any more practicablethan it appears to be in the case of the other Dominionswe feel that some form of Ministerial representationis better than none.50     As stated above the distinction between thePrime Minister and a Minister is agreed with but a minister charged with a special mission and carrying the endorsement of the Australian Parliament is somewhat different from a Minister with a department portfoliovisiting London to establish contact with thecorresponding United Kingdom department with which heis concerned,,6*      The views of the Prime Minister of canada and South Africa are noted with interest but not withsurprise.    As you are well aware their attitude is determined by local problems peculiar to each Dominionwhich have been manifest since the Imperial Conferenceof 19269   We, too, have a special viewpoint based on&apos; the closest possible degree of Empire co-operation which,speaking with that frankness permitted within the familycircle is evident by comparison of our all round war effort on land, sea and in the air.    The Australianpeople feel, however^ that this effort warrants the rightto be heard when vital decisions affecting their interests are being taken.    For instance, Australia has aspecial interest in the Pacific and Indian Ocean problem.79      No suggestion has been made by the australian government involving the retirement of any british minister from the War Cabinet;    Regarding the presenceof an Australian Minister as suggested in my paragraph it is understood that, at the War Cabinet Meetings, manyMinisters attend in addition to members of the War Cabinet..Attendance of a Dominion representative therefore, meansonly one person whether he be Prime Minister or Minister.If the other Dominions are satisfied with the present arrangements this should alleviate the numerical aspectbut if there are questions for decision affecting theirvital interests representation could not be denied if they desired it.8.     This is covered by my paragraph 3.9.     As you state relations between a Minister andthe High Commissioner are matters for our decision.The appointment and functions of the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs is a similar one for the UnitedKingdom Government.    Though we fully appreciate co-operation and assistance extended by the Ministers whohave held this office, we consider that direct consultation on higher questions is a better method than dealing through a third party who is not a member of the War Cabinet.

The satisfaction of the other Dominions with the HighCommissioner arrangement   na tur ally-fellow &amp; from their____attitude &quot;&quot;to Ministerial^-representation.10.      The question of an Imperial War Cabinet is ofcourse a matter for an Imperial Conference.    As statedearlier we were unable in 1937 to secure a round tablediscussion on this and many other important aspects of co-operation.    We are, however, not concerned&apos;with the pastbut with vital present and critical future,,CYPHER TELEGRAM.Prom the Government of theCOMMONWEALTH OP australia to DOMINIONS 0PPICEoReceived 5th S september, 1941.        8.00 p.m.IMMEDIATE.No.   586    SECRET.Following for Prime Minister from my PrimeMinister,    Begins.Following the announcement made last week inParliament that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealthof Australia had decided to send a Minister to London,His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia has given further,consideration to the matter and has selectedSir Earle Page Tov this important mission.There is no need for me to set out in detailSir Earle7s qualifications as he is known to you and your colleagues.Your assurance that you will welcome our minister is very greatly appreciated and we know that he willreceived every facility and courtesy from you and Membersof your Administration.I propose to make an announcement that Sir EarlePage will be our representative in the Australian Press ofMonday morning, 8th September,,        Ends,ui-^i mi    ********** ,.^.^^mo.^&quot;, ^n^j^fa^^i^mc.-^
