ANNEX III.Draft Telegram to Sir R. I. Campbell, Washington.(Most Secret.)(No. .)&quot;Repeat to Moscow.Your tel. No. 4217 [of the 12th September : Caucasus oil].We welcome most cordially United States form of assurance. In informingState Department please express warm appreciation of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment for most helpful attitude taken by them in this issue, which seems to us tobe of the greatest possible importance.2. Please inform me when Presidents approval is given and telegraphicinstructions are being sent to United States Ambassador at Moscow.ANNEX IV.Draft Telegram to Sir S. Cripps, Moscow.(No.     .  Most Secret.)Repeat to Washington.My immediately preceding telegram.I will inform you so soon as I learn instructions have been sent to yourUnited States colleague, and you should at once concert with him.2.&apos; United States assurances have been drawn up in such a way as to conform as closely as possible, having regard to the different circumstances, to proposed British assurances contained in my telegram No. 4687 to Washington(of the 23rd August). For this reason and others, which will be explained toyou by Mr. Berthoud, we do not propose to adopt suggestions put forward in yourtelegram No. 1073 (of the 2nd September).3. As you are aware, it is intended that these assurances should be givento the Soviet Government in the event of the situation, as regards the german advance towards the Caucasus, becoming so acute that further delay in ensuring the demolition of oil installations would appear to be dangerous. You should,of course, only act if you reach the conclusion that there is a real doubt whetherthe Russians intend to demolish adequately and that an assurance is likely to turn the scales and result in adequate demolition. In that event, acting in con-sultation with your United States colleague, you should inform appropriateSoviet authority, preferably Stalin himself orally, that you have been authorisedto give the assurances. You may leave with him aide-memoire containing the assurances.4. When you consider the time has come to take the action outlined in thepreceding paragraph you should, if possible, consult me by telegram before so doing. If you feel that circumstances render it essential to give the assuranceswithout losing the time involved in consulting me, you may do so. In the latter case you should inform me of your action immediately. You should, in any case,not take action before the return of Mr. Berthoud to Moscow. Mr. Berthoudshould reach Moscow with or before the Beaverbrook Mission.5. If you think it more advantageous you may open our draft Declarationwith the following words : &quot; If as a result of the destruction by the Soviet^Government of the Caucasian oil industry they require . . . .&quot; These wordsclosely resemble United States draft, and are in substitution of the words : &quot;Ifthe Soviet Government .... as a result.&quot; Please let us know which formulayou prefer.
