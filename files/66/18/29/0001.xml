THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   August 1941.SECRET.W.F. (41) 206.August 28, 1941.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.BLOCKADE POLICY: MILK FOR CHILDREN IN VICHY FRANCE.MemorandiiTfi by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ANNEXED is a copy of a message which Lord Halifax, has received from president Roosevelt advocating the admission through the blockade of further supplies of milk for children in unoccupied France.2. My colleagues will recollect that we reaffirmed as recently as the28th July (Cabinet Conclusions 75 (41) 9) the policy which we have hithertofollowed in regard to food for the occupied countries, namely, that the Germansmust be held responsible for the peoples of the countries which they&apos; have overrun.We also had in mind that the new harvest would now be meeting the immediatenecessities.3. In January of this year, when we agreed to a former request of thePresident to allow the entry of some milk and vitamins for the children ofunoccupied France, we did so largely because it was felt that a distinction couldbe drawn between unoccupied France and the occupied countries. In May,however, when we learnt that the Vichy Government had concluded a barter deal in food on a very large scale with the Germans, we refused to sanction furthershipments under this scheme, and we understood that the United States Govern-ment were in sympathy&apos;with our decision. Since then Admiral Darlan&apos;s policyof collaboration has gone to much greater lengths, and we are entitled to regard the unoccupied territory as having come increasingly under the control ofthe Axis.4. In these circumstances I do not myself feel able to recommend that weshould make this concession to Vichy while continuing to deny the many andpowerful requests which we are receiving from the Governments of the allied countries, Belgium, Greece and Norway in particular. The situation in the twoformer is certainly much worse than in unoccupied France, and I consider thata concession to the latter would not only raise most serious difficulties for us with the Allied Governments, but would also be vigorously attacked at home.5. At the same time we must recognise the difficulty of returning anuncompromising negative to the President. There are reasons to believe that theAmerican Red Cross has a very special influence with him; and we on our sidecannot but agree that it is a genuine humanitarian body against which no suchaccusations of anti-British sentiment can be brought as against Mr. Hoover&apos;organisation.6. On the whole I am disposed to suggest that in reply to the President weshould point out the grave political difficulty in which his request in favour ofVichy France has placed us, and should offer, if he considers that humanitarian11472   [22859]
opinion in America must be given some outlet for its beneficence, to permitlimited quantities of milk to be distributed by the American Red Cross in theAllied countries as well as in Vichy France. , .&apos;7. I realise the departure from our existing policy which this proposalinvolves. I am impressed, however, by the necessity of our making some gesturewhich may help to stay the demoralization which the shortage of food, and inparticular of food for children, will almost certainly create in the occupied territories during the coming winter. It would not be practicable to allow thedespatch of food-stuffs generally; but there is a special case in favour of milk for children. I am well aware that the supply of milk in the United States, even for ourselves, is short; but I should have thought that the sacrifice of a smallallocation for occupied countries would be worth making, both as a means ofmaintaining morale in those territories and as a concession to opinion in theUnited States.A. E.Foreign Office, August 28, 1941.Annex.Message from the President to Lord Halifax.I FORGOT to speak to you about milk for unoccupied France. NormanDavis informs me that you understand the matter.Since the American Red Cross has its supervisory organization there and thedistribution of supplies previously sent was completed the 1st August, they musteither withdraw entirely or send further supplies at once. I feel that, in order tomaintain, morale, it is advisable to continue, at least for the present, limited ship-ments of milk and clothing for children through the American Red Cross.Please take this up with Winston and advise.ROOSEVELT.August 21, 1941.
