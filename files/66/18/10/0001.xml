(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).SB G R E T..W.P.(41)  187*6TH AUGUST,  1941, COPY NO. jWAR CABINET.-SITES FOR FUTURE AERODROMES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.&quot;By the spring of 1943,.- we require for the Royal AirForce, 622 aerodromes in the United Kingdom.    The number completedor under construction is 496..   We therefore need another 126 and ifthe United States were  :o enter the war and send squadrons here,we should want still mere...2..       The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries agrees thatthe Air Ministry must have sufficient land to provide the aerodromesit requires and says that the question is not how much land itshould have, but which land.,.3. ^      The location of aerodromes is largely determined byoperational considerations..  Already we are approaching saturationpoint for aerodromes in many areas.- Our freedom of choice is becoming more and more limited and all land which is suitable foraerodromes may have to be used for this purpose.4,        The programme for the expansion of the Royal Air Force:is a phased programme and delay in any one of its parts means delay in the whole.5.        I am, therefore, bound to have regard in selecting sitesto the time likely to bo required to prepare them. &quot; The longer thetime,  the fewer the aerodromes that can be taken in hand with thelabour available. . Sites which require the diversion of the grid,extensive levelling and other similar wom have, therefore,  seriousdrawbacks.6..        The existing liaison procedure is actively functioningand ensures that agricvltural interests arc fully consulted.7...      The preliminaries already take up a good deal of precioustime and I cannot afford to lose more.   -8.        I submit that Ministerial arbitration is unnecessary.    I doubt if ft is practicable.     It is certainly undesirable since itwould spin out the preliminaries and hinder me in discharging myobligation to provide an air force of decisive strength at theearliest possible moment.9.       Aircraft, aircrews and grain are coming from overseas;aerodromes can only be found here.Air Ministry.6th August, 1941A.H.M. S.
