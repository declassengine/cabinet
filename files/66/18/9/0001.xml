THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  August 1941.MOST SECRET.W.P. (41) 186.August 1, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.AERODROME DEFENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.I CIRCULATE for the information of the War Cabinet and the DefenceCommittee copies of a minute from the Prime Minister and of my reply on thedefence of Royal Air Force Aerodromes.A. Ff. M. S.Air Ministry, August 1, 1941.Minute from the Prime Minister dated June 29, 1941.Secretary of State for Air.1. Further to my Minute of the 20th June about the responsibility of theAir Force for the local and static defence of aerodromes. Every man in Air Forceuniform ought to be armed with something, a rifle, a tommy gun, a pistoh a pikeor a mace; and every one, without exception, should &amp;o at least one hour&apos;s drilland practice every day. Every airman should have his place in the defence scheme. At least once a week an alarm should be given as an. exercise (statedclearly beforehand in the signal that it is an exercise) and every man should beat his post. 90 per cent, should be at their fighting stations in five minutes atthe most. It must be, understood by all ranks that they are expected to fight anddie in the defence of their airfields. Every building which fits in with thescheme of defence should be prepared, so that each has to be conquered one byone by the enemy&apos;s parachute or glider troops. Each of these posts should have its leader appointed. In two or three hours the troops will arrive, meanwhileevery post should resist them and must be maintained he it only a cottage or amess so that the enemy has to master each one. This is a slow and expensiveprocess for him1.2. The enormous mass of non-combatant personnel who look after the very few heroic pilots who alone in ordinary circumstances do all the fighting, is&quot; aninherent difficulty in the organisation of the Air Force. Here is the chance forthis great mass to add a fighting quality to the necessary services they perform.Every airfield should be a stronghold of fighting, air-groundmen, and not the abodeof uniformed civilians in the prime of life protected by detachments of soldiers.[22784]Copy No.
3. In order that I may study this matter in detail let me have the exactfield state of. Northolt aerodrome, showing every class of airman, the work he does,the weapons he has, and his part in the scheme of defence. We simply cannot afford to have the best part of half a million uniformed men, with all the prestige of the Royal Air Force attaching to them, who have not got a definite fighting-value quite apart from the indispensable services they perform for the pilots.w. s. c.June 29. 1941.Minute from Secretary of State for Air in reply.Prime Minister.Your Minute M. 681/1, about the Defence of Aerodromes, of the 29th Junehas been the subject of more than one discussion at which you have been present.You will now expect to receive some report of the action taken in accordance withthe decisions reached at these meetings, and also answers to the questions, of detail, which you raised in your Minute.We are as determined as you that aerodrome defences shall be brought to thehighest pitch of efficiency, that every airman must have a definite place in thescheme of defence, that as many as possible shall be equipped with weapons,however rudimentary, and that all should be imbued with a fighting spirit.Air Marshal Peck has already had two meetings with representatives of HomeCommands to discuss detailed suggestions for giving effect to these principles.Further meetings are to be held so that experience can be pooled, plansco-ordinated, and decisions followed up and implemented swiftly. The following main points were dealt with in your minute : 1.   Provision of arms.We are very short of modern weapons but the Findlater Stewart committee recommended large additional supplies, particularly for the most vulnerablestations, and these are now coming through.All Commands were instructed to carry out an immediate stock-taking onthe lines you suggested for Northolt to determine the exact position and to define the size of the problem of ensuring that every man should carry a weapon ofsome kind. The results show that there are about 170,000 men on aerodromeswithout arms of any kind. Grenades are being provided for all men who are neither otherwise armed nor destined for employment on specific non-combatantduties stretcher bearers, telephone operators, &amp;c, on a scale of 5 per man. OurStation Commanders have been urged to make up supplies of weapons where necessary by exercising their ingenuity on the lines laid down in your Minute,and we shall apply ourselves energetically to this task. The War Office areallocating to us 20,000 of a new form of bayonet pike.Various other useful ideas emerged from these meetings.   For example : (i) The possibility of using the turrets of dispersed aircraft and trainingturrets where these are available in tactical positions to cover certainvital areas with their fire;(ii) The provision of increased local financial powers to enable more rapidprovision and construction of defence works and weapons;(iii) The provision of bicycles and motor-bicycles to increase the mobility ofthe defence forces, &amp;c.2.   Training.This is necessarily restricted in the first place by a shortage of weapons andammunition, and in the second place by the heavy pressure of work imposed by current operations. Even, however, if we cannot reach your standard of an hour&apos;s training a day, we shall do as much as we possibly can. StationCommanders will be impressed with the importance of frequent practices, aspecial allocation of arms Tommy guns particularly will be made immediatelyfor training purposes and every man will be taught his place in the defence scheme; and the use of the weapon with which he is to be supplied. An intensivedrive is to be put behind this training in the next few weeks.
3.   Provision of works to form station buildings into strong points.The construction of reinforcements for station buildings, and dispersal pens,the construction of strong points and the making of slit trenches in positionscovering the landing area will be pressed forward with maximum speed.4.   Morale.The vital importance of the defence of their aerodromes will continue to be impressed upon ground crews, clerks, cooks and mechanics, and they will respond.I attach a copy of a letter which the C.A.S. has addressed to all Commanders-in-Chief on this subject.A. H. M. S.July 28, 1941.Letter from C.A.S. to all R.A.F. Commanders-in-Chief at Home and theAir Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland.July 5, 1941.The Chiefs of Staff have recently considered how the general strategical situation affects the threat of invasion of this country. This review has shownthat all forms of offence and defence to resist invasion must be brought to thehighest pitch of efficiency by the 1st September.I am therefore writing to each Commander-in-Chief asking him tore-examine at once all his anti-invasion plans and to take all possible steps toperfect anti-invasion measures by that date, while taking care that vigilance inthe meanwhile is in no way relaxed.I would ask you to see that all preparations are thoroughly overhauled, andthat the need for devoting redoubled energy to them is made as widely known aspossible.Above all, it must be impressed on all ranks that the first effort of theGermans, if they invade, will be directed against our aerodromes, and that uponthe result of this attack will depend, in all probability, the success or failure ofthe invasion and the result of the war. The attack can be made to fail if, and only if, every man in R.A.F. uniform is determined to use every possible means in resisting it and is prepared to die in defence of his Station. Every availableman must have some weapon, be it only a mace or pike made in R.A.F. workshops,which he is trained to use and prepared to fight with to the last. No one mustbe allowed to rely on others for protection; all must realise that their duty is tokill the attacking Germans by every means in their power and to hold on to theirStation, to the death if necessary. Invasion will give to the Service as a wholean opportunity to show that the fighting spirit of the Air Force is not confined to the small number whose duty takes them into the air. It must be a point of honour that no armed and unwounded man will ever surrender to the Germanairborne forces.The Prime Minister has recently emphasised these points and has givendefinite instructions about the training in aerodrome defence which must be givento ground personnel. Air Marshal Peck is at present considering how best to implement these instructions, and, as you will be aware, held a conference on the3rd July to discuss the whole question.(Signed) C. PORTAL.Note. The field state of Northolt prepared in reply to paragraph 3 of the PrimeMinister&apos;s minute is not circulated.
