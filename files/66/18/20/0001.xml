UP 12)4 * 2u19TH AUGUST.  1941. /WAR CABINET.LORD HANKEY&apos;S COMMITTEE ON PREVENTING OIL PROMREACHING ENEMY POWERS.CAUCASIAN    OIL.1. It will &quot;be recalled that on the 22nd July, 1941^cur Ambassador in Moscow reported a conversation withMi  Stalin in which the latter expressed his intention to order the destruction of the Caucasian oil industry ratherthan allow it to fall intact into the hands of the germans and accepted the principle of co-operation with ua for the planning of oil demolition generally.      Such co-operation,however,  was only to be initiated at a moment consideredsuitable to M.  Stalin who did not think that the time had yet arrived to enter into this exchange of information.2. As a result of the serious view taken by theChiefs of Staff of the menace to the Caucasus which maysoon develop from the present position in the Ukraine, atelegram36 was despatched on 15th August,  1941, to our ambassador urging him to enquire of M.  Stalin how mattersstand as to the demolition plans and whether the moment for consultation with our experts has not arrived.3. The Ambassador feels that complete reliance cannot,He placed in M.  Stalin&apos;s declared intention to destroy the caucasian oil industry in view of the resultant economic,and therefore political dependence on the Western Powers towhich it would lead during, and more especially,  after the cessation of hostilities.      To overcome any last minutehesitation our Ambassador is anxious to be able to give assurances to the Soviet Government as to supplies of oil and equipment until Russian production can be restored.Moscow Telegram No.835 dated 22ndJuly,  1941.x P. 0.   Telegram&apos;No. 1050 dated 15thAugust,  1941.

4.       - We therefore propose that the Ambassador beauthorised, at Ms discretion&apos;-; to make a declaration inthe following terms, if in his opinion the orders to destroy the Caucasian oil industry are likely to bedangerously delayed in the absence of some suchdeclaration: -&quot;(a) If the Soviet Government carry out their intention to destroy the Caucasian oil industry and require as a result to importoil both for their war purposes&quot;and duringthe period of postwar reconstruction, HisMajesty-s Government will assist the soviet union by every means in their power to obtainsuch supplies,      To this end His Majesty&apos;sGovernment undertake in respect of oil supplies available within the sterling area,to accrrd to the Soviet Union both prior tothe cessation of hostilities and, if necessary,for a period of two years thereafter,  equality of treatment with Great Britain for essential requirements of equal importance,,(b) Conditions of purchase and payment for the oil to be agreed between the two government(c) For postwar requirements of oil the soviet union to receive in regard to ocean tanker tonnage and freight rates equality oftreatment with Great Britain for essential requirements of equal importance0(d) Replacement of drilling and refining equipmentnecessitated by the destruction lg&apos; the soviet union of the Caucasian oil industry will,insofar as such equipment is available from within the sterling area, be dealt with byHis Majesty&apos;s Government in accordance withthe same principles as those laid down in thisagreement for oil,,(e) The above undertakings are given on the basis that in such a case it is right for governments which are allied during and after thfo wao toassist one another as regards postwarreconstruction,,&quot;U.S.A.  CO-OPERATIONa5. The value to the Russians of our declaration willbe greatly enhanced if it is supported by a similardeclaration by the United States government     In theparticular case of tanker assistance during the war UnitedStates concurrence is essential and is, we think, likelyto be forthcoming,.     We therefore propose that the UnitedStates Government be approached as soon as possible.6. If, however, circumstances demand a declaration onour part before the attitude of the United States has beenclarified, we recommend that the declaration referred toin paragraph 4 above be made unilaterally accompanied bya verbal statement to the effect that we are in communication with the Government of the UtfSeAu with aview to acquiring their co-operation.

ALLIED TANKER CO-OPERATION,7. The Minister gf V/ar Transport attaches greatimportance to relating&apos; the proposed British declaration to other existing and future arrangements affecting the useof Allied tonnage for common purposes both during andafter the war.     In view of the importance of avoiding delay and of having in readiness a self-contained and uneq.uivo.calBritish undertaking we have not inserted any referenceto the Allied governments in the text of the declaration.We consider it essential, however, that theMinister of War Transport should be free in the event of theundertaking being given to the Soviet Government, at his discretion, to inform the Allied Governments concerned thatsuch an undertaking has been given and to enlist their co-operation.FINANCIAL COMMITMENT.8. From the information submitted to us it wouldappear that the financial commitments resulting from our declaration might, if the war lasts for two years afterdemolition, amount to about  100,000,000*      It is, howeverimpossible to make any accurate estimates.      It is intended that the Soviet Government should repay in full,  over aperiod of years, the value of any oil and equipment suppliedas a result of our undertaking,CONCLUSION,.9, We are anxious that Mr, Berthoud, oil adviser to the moscow Missions, who is now in London, should return to moscow as soon as possible with full instructions.10,       In view of this and the serious view taken by theChiefs ^f Staff of the military situation in the Ukrainewe invite the -Cabinet as a matter of urgency to give theirauthorisation to the proposals outlined in paragraphs 4 and 5and to the procedure recommended in paragraph 6 above.Signed on behalf of the Committee.HANKEY,Chairman,Great George Street, SbW.l,,19TH AUGUST y 1941,
