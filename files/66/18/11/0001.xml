fO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK A\ND KEY.It isikon toTHIS DOCUMENT IS THEIE&apos; PROPERTY OF IilS&apos;&quot;&apos;BRITAMIC k*WrESTY&apos;S GOj^MTT.COFI NO./SECRET./W.P.(4l)l88.V7th August, 1941.WAR CABINET.Supply of Technicians to Foreign Countries *Memorandum by; the Minister of Labour and National Service^.1.     Arrang era exits are &quot;being made to recruit as quickly as rjossible the techniciansfor Turkey referred to in the memorandum (W.P.(4l)l77) by the Foreign Secretarywhich was considered by the War Cabinet at its 73rd meeting, and I hope soon tobe able to report considerable progress.     We are looking to industry to makea substantial contribution, although the Admiralty and the Ministry of supply will, it is hoped, be able to supply some men from their industrial establishments.2*     The Foreign Secretary referred to the -possibility of similar demands fortechnicians from Iran, and there may be other countries who may ask for suchhelp or to whom we ought to offer it, but I must warn my colleagues that if suchdemands do mature in any appreciable number, I can hold out no hope of takingthe men required from the industrial field.     We are already seriously short of technical, managerial and supervisory staff for our own war industries not   to mention the demands made upon us for the war production of India and theDominions.3.     The only alternative source of supply is I suggest to be found in the armed Forces, and if we are to take, as the Foreign Secretary suggests, aleaf out of the Germans&apos; book in applying the policy of infiltration, thereare obvious military advantages in making use of technicians drawn from this source.4.     If, therefore, we   may expect to have to meet more demands for technicians,I suggest it would be wise to make a search in the Armed Forces for the kinds of people likely to be asked for and build up a register upon which to draw incase of need.     The Foreign Office would, without specifically raising theissue in the countries concerned, no doubt be able to discover the probablerequirements, both in numbers and types of technicians, of those countries towhich it would be of advantage to apply the policy of infiltration on theGerman model.5. I do not, of course, rule out a contribution from industry but for thereasons I have indicated it must necessarily be small.(Intd.)   E.B.7th August, 1941.H.Q.204-65 H.K.
