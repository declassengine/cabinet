(THIS DOCUMENT JLS THE JPHOPEETY JDF JHIS ..BRI TAHNIG _MA.JE.STX^S JQOVERNMENT )SECRET,W. P. (41)193.2IL DENIAL SCHEME - Miri  (Sarawak) and Seria (Brunei).Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1.    With reference to my memorandum of the 24th of February,W.P. (41)42, I have to inform the &quot;War Cabinet that the original scheme has now been revised on the advice of the Chiefs of staff and the Oversea Defence Committees and in consultation with theC. in 0. Far East, C.  in C. China, and the Governor of theStraits Settlements.2.    The original scheme was framed on the assumption that therepapture of the oilfields, if they were seized by Japan, wouldnot be long delayed.    In the present circumstances it is feltthat our action in the event of a Japanese attempt to seize the oilfields should not be hampered by any desire to retain themessentially intact for our eventual reoccupation.    It has there fore been decided that the character of the scheme should be changed and that it should become a thorough-going scheme ofdemolition of the oilfields, refinery, pipe-lines, etc., designedto prevent the Japanese drawing any oil from the fields for an/indefinite period.      The local authorities have accordingly been instructed to draw up the necessary revised plans forthwith, togive effect to the changed policy.      The Oversea.   DefenceCommittee have been informed that the best method of putting thewells out of action is to plug them, and it is understood thatthis is already being done in Iraq.    Technical experts are &quot;being sent to advise the local authorities on this at Miri.    In Sarawakand Brunei this process is likely to take about a month, and it is felt, therefore, that a start should be made as soon as possible after the advice of the experts has been obtained.3. The methods of authorising the execution of the demolitionscheme have also been revised as follows:-The scheme will not be put into force automaticallyon receipt of the &quot;Warning telegram&quot; initiating the&quot;Precautionary Stage&quot; against Japan.A separate and special message will be sent by theSecretary of State for the Colonies to the Commander-in-Chief, China,  through the Governor, Straits Settlements,giving the necessary authority, either before or afterthe issue of the &quot;Warning telegram&quot;.16th AUGUST, 1941.COPY NO.

The original scheme was framed on the assumption that therecapture of the oilfields, if they were seized &quot;by Japan, wouldnot he long delayed.    In the present circumstances it is feltthat oxsr action in the event of a Japanese attempt to seize, the oilfields should not he hampered by any desire to retain themessentially intact for our eventual re occupation.    It has there fore been decided that the character of the scheme should be changed, and that it should become a thorough-going scheme ofdemolition of the oilfields, refinery, pipe-lines, etc., designedto prevent the Japanese drawing any oil from the fields for an/indefinite period.      The local authorities have accordingly been instructed to draw up the necessary revised plans forthwith, togive effect tp the changed policy.      The Oversea.   DefenceCommittee have been informed that the best method of putting thewells out of action is to plug them, and It is understood thatthis is already being done in Iraq.    Technical experts are being sent to advise the local authorities on this at Miri.

Complete discretion has, however, &quot;been given to theCommander--in-Chief, China;  to put the scheme into effecton his own responsibility at any time if, -in hisopinion, Japanese actions in the neighbourhood make it advisable.4.       In the event of it being considered necessary to authorisethe demolition scheme to be put into force before the issue of the warning telegram, I propose  (after obtaining the concurrence of theAdmiralty) to seek the authority of the Prime Minister inaccordance with the decision arrived at on the 27th of February,1941 (W. M. (41,) 21st Conclusions),5.       If the necessity to send instructions from London for thescheme to be put into operation arises -af ter the issue of the warning telegram, I propose to issue these instructions withoutfurther reference to the War Cabinet or the Prime Minister, but with the concurrence of the Admiralty.    (The Service Departmentsagree to this proposal).6.       Meanwhile, in view of the length of time required forthe plugging of wells, I consider that this should be put in hand at once in accordance with such advice as may be tendered by the experts.    Moreover, I recommend that approval should be given,without further reference to the War Cabinet or Prime Minister,&quot;for any preparatory measures which, on the advice of the technical experts, the Commander-in-Chief, China, may recommend as necessaryin order to ensure that the refinery and other plant is ready forinstant demolition, even to the&quot;, extent of closing down the refineryforthwith and withdrawing the technicians who are at present workingthere.7,       I should be grateful for approval of the course of action proposed in this paper.
