NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Our shipping losses have again been light. Destructive raids by our aircraft have caused serious casualties to enemy snipping in the Mediterranean.Home Waters.2. On the 18th August H.M.S. Prince of Wales arrived in Home Waterson completion of the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to President Roosevelt.On the 16th an enemy aircraft, which attacked a group of minesweepersoff the East Coast, was destroyed.H.M. Destroyer Quorn was damaged off Cromer by a mine. War Nizam(Royal Fleet Auxiliary) sustained damage in an air attack off the East Coast.During an air raid on Lowestoft the naval stores, offices and canteen weredemolished and a tug was sunk in the harbour.During the week approximately 9,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or seriously damaged by aircraft of Bomber, Fighter and Coastal Commands.A number of small ships were also successfully attacked.North Atlantic.3. Early on the 19th the Norwegian Destroyer Bath, while escorting an outward-bound convoy to Gibraltar, was torpedoed and sunk by a U-Boat520 miles west of Ushant. There were forty-six survivors, two of whomsubequently died.H.M. Corvette Picotee is overdue and must be presumed lost. She was onconvoy duty to Iceland (C) when last reported.South Atlantic.4. H.M.S. Despatch intercepted the German s.s. Norderney (3,667 tons)which scuttled herself and subsequently sank. She sailed from Para, Brazil, onthe 9th August. The Italian s.s. Stella (4,272 tons), which sailed from Pernambucoon the 30th July, was intercepted by H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Circassia,and is being taken into Bermuda.Mediterranean.5. On the 13th August H.M. Schooner Kephalonia foundered while on passage from Alexandria to Tobruk.During the week under review Blenheim and Swordfish aircraft from Maltahave sunk or seriously damaged 44,600 tons of enemy shipping between sicily and the African coast, details of which are given in the Air Section. A destroyer,which was escorting a convoy, was torpedoed by Swordfish aircraft and probably sunk.The Spanish s.s. Berga (804 tons), bound for Genoa with a cargo of pyritesfor Frankfort, was intercepted off Almeria and brought into Gibraltar by an armed guard. Interception was made possible.by the connivance of the Basquecaptain and the first officer, who navigated their ship outside territorial waters.This ship had recently been purchased by the German trade organisation in madrid.The Netherlands Submarine 0. 23, operating in the Central Mediterranean,attacked a convoy escorted by four destroyers and probably hit two ships.During the week ten French merchant ships (44,242 tons) eastward, and four (17,769 tons) westward have passed Gibraltar under escort.Anti-Submarine Operations.&apos;6. H.M. Canadian Corvette Alberni, escorting an outward bound convoyto Canada, claims to have destroyed a U-boat 500 miles north-east of St. Johns,Newfoundland. H.M. Trawler Stella Capella made an attack off Wick and fiveattacks were made by aircraft without definite results; two in the Bay of Biscay,
one south-west of Iceland (C), one in the Western Approaches, and one off CapeWrath. . \jIn the Mediterranean our aircraft have&apos; twice attacked a U-boat in BardiaHarbour.Enemy Intelligence.7. No change has been reported in the positions of the main German andItalian units.The Turkish Government has given permission for the Italian FleetAuxiliary tanker Tarvisio to proceed into the Black Sea.U-Boats.8. Over thirty German U-boats and six Italians have been operating in the atlantic. It is estimated that some of the Germans have been operating in a central area of the North Atlantic to the southward of Iceland (C). Six or sevenare known to be on the convoy route to the westward of Finisterre.On the 18th August air reconnaissance located thirteen U-boats in norwegian waters.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.9. According to the information at present available, shipping casualties during the week have again been light. An outward-bound convoy to Gibraltar,which had previously been located by enemy aircraft, was attacked by U-boats in the Western Approaches to the westward of Ushant, and three ships were sunk. One ship on passage from Gibraltar to Canada was sunk 400 miles west ofOporto. One ship was sunk and another seriously damaged by E-boat attack offCromer. A north-bound convoy was repeatedly attacked-by aircraft on the east coast, but only one ship was damaged; the first attack was carried out by at least six aircraft, one of which was destroyed and two others damaged by gun-fire fromthe ships in convoy and their escort. A British tanker was damaged by a torpedofrom aircraft north of Port Said.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending the 20th August, 790 ships, including141 Allied and 16 neutral, were convoyed. Two anti-aircraft ships, ten armed merchant cruisers, seventy-three destroyers and ninety-two sloops, corvettes andminesweepers were employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the16th August totalled 618,817 tons, compared with 881,859 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 855,938 tons during the past ten weeks. Oil importstotalled 216,512 tons. Mineral imports amounted to 151,745 tons^ of which103,976 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. Timber and wood pulpimports were 14,257 tons; copra and palm oil 18,729 tons and cereals 50,851 tons.Other food imports amounted to 134,633 tons, of which the principal commoditieswere : sugar 65,208 tons; cocoa 7,036 tons; fruit 3,205 tons; cheese 2,349 tons;eggs 1,460 tons; tea 733 tons. There were also 2,145 tons of unspecified tinnedgoods. Tobacco imports were 3,200 tons. There were also large quantities ofmachinery, high explosives and other war material.British Minelaying.11. No minelaying by surface craft has been carried out during the week under review.Aircraft have laid mines in the Baltic, and off the Dutch, Belgian and FrenchAtlantic coasts.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping12. Minelaying by enemy aircraft has been confined to the East Coast,between the Humber and the Farne Islands, with one night only of slight activity
in the Thames Estuary. Seven magetic and six acoustic mines have been destroyed during the week.  The totals now are : magnetic 1,335, acoustic 938, contact 1,021.In the Mediterranean, Mersa Matruh was raided by minelaying aircraft on one night during the week, and the port is closed.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.13. It has been reported that five transports loaded with artillery, motor transport and troops left Trondhjem between the 12th and 14th August.Italian.14. The press report that the Capo Arma (3,175 tons) had been sunk by oneof our submarines is incorrect. This ship has arrived at Trieste. The tankerGiove (5,211 tons), which had been scuttled at Massawa, has now been raised and taken in prize.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.15. During the past week the main and most successful German effort hascontinued to be in the Ukraine, although an advance has also been made eastwardof Lake Peipus on the Baltic Front and there are indications of a thrustsouthwards from the Smolensk sector.Finland.16. The only developments of importance on the Finnish front have occurred on the north-west shore of Lake Ladoga. As the German-Finnish claim to havetaken the towns -of Sortavala, at the extreme north corner of the lake, andHittola, at the western corner, is probably true, it should not be long before theenemy holds the whole of the north-western shore.The Baltic Front.17. The German effort on this front has been intensified. Their forces have probably joined hands north of Lake Peipus, but Tallinn and Baltisk,and possibly also Narva, appear still to be holding out. The Germans have advanced beyond Kingisepp, 12 miles east of Narva, along the railway towardsLeningrad, and east of Lake Peipus a drive towards Novgorod appears to bedeveloping favourably.White Russia.18. A south-easterly drive is developing in the direction of the Bryansk-Gomel railway. The reference in the Soviet Communique to heavy fighting aboutGomel suggests that the advance has made some progress. Its continuance maybe designed to take in flank the defences on the River Dnieper about Kiev andfurther south.Ukraine.19. In trie Kiev sector, the Russians appear to be continuing their successfulresistance to German pressure.20. South of Kiev, however, German forces have reached the Dnieper atKrementschug, and have captured Krivoi Rog, 70 miles due south. In thesouthern part of this sector they are advancing successfully and rapidly on theLower Dnieper as the Russians withdraw, and, with the capture of Nikolaev,have completed the encirclement of the Odessa area.Operations.Egypt and Libya.21. Operations around Tobruk and in the frontier area have been chieflyconfined to patrol activity and artillery duels. &quot;&apos;/ On the .15th August three
companies of enemy motorised infantry attempted an advance in the coastal sectoreast of the frontier, but were held up by our minefields and later withdrew.22. On the 16th August an increase of 600 enemy M.T. in the frontier area was observed. Recent arrivals of Italian troops have consisted mainly of draftsfor units already in Libya.A abyssinia.23. Pressure on the enemy garrisons at Gondar and Wolchefjt is being maintained.Convoys.24.   The following have arrived at Suez by convoy : 1st/5th Essex Regiment (161 Inf. Bde.).4th Northumberland Fusiliers (Recce. Bn. 50th Division).One Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery.Intelligence.Italy.25. There are indications that the garrison of Sicily, which during theGreek war&apos; was reduced to two divisions, has been reinforced. No certainidentifications have yet been made, but the fact of reinforcement may be accepted,and the present strength of the garrison is provisionally estimated at 3-4divisions.Roumania.26. The Danube bridge at Cernavoda was bombed on the 10th August andone end of the bridge was severely damaged by fire. Railway communication between Constanza and Bucharest is being carried on by the use of a temporarystructure by which passengers and goods are transferred to another train. Itis estimated locally that repairs to the bridge will take three weeks. The pipe-line to Constanza, which crosses the Danube by this bridge, was cut by the bombing, but it is believed that repairs to this can be quickly carried out.Yugoslavia.27. Reports of guerrilla fighting and sabotage continue and are believed to be widely distributed. The Italians in Montenegro have been harassed bybands from the Sandjak and from Southern Herzegovina, an.area which hasbeen proclaimed as &quot; Free Unoccupied Yugoslavia.&quot; The capture by theseguerrillas of several villages in Bosnia is reported, while the railway betweenSplit and Zagreb has been the subject of repeated acts of sabotage. Drasticpunishments, according to official German announcements, continue to be inflicted on the &quot; Communist rebels,&quot; but the insurgents are clearly gaining confidence.Manchukuo.28. It is estimated that the total Japanese strength in Manchukuo and in.E. Korea is-19 Divisions (includes 2 in N.E. Korea).2 Cavalry Bdes.4 Tank Regiments.In addition, there are approximately 250,000 troops of the localManchukuoan Army which can be used for garrison duties, and so release themajority of the Japanese first-line troops for offensive operations.The main Japanese concentration is taking place in Eastern Manchukuo and north-Eastern Korea, whilst a strategic reserve seems to be forming in the areaalong the railway Dairen-Mukden-Harbin. There are subsidiary concentrationsin the Hailar-Solun and Heiho areas.A considerable amount of material and stores have been landed at Dairen,which appears to be the main base port for the Japanese forces in Manchukuo.
Indo-China.29. It is believed that the majority of the 40,000 Japanese troops destinedto garrison Indo-China have now arrived. The main dispositions of these troops,appear to be in accordance with the agreement with Vichy, i.e., in the vicinity of the air and naval bases-the bulk&quot;&apos;being located in the Saigon area. There isno confirmation of press reports that the Japanese are massing troops on theThai frontier, though it is probable that small detachments have been recon-noitring at various points in Central and Northern Indo-China opposite thatfrontier. A likely inference is that Japan contemplates a more complete controlover Indo-China than the official agreement with Vichy envisaged. From thepoint of view of military operations against Thailand, Japan would get no advantage from stationing troops in Northern and Central Indo-China, in viewof the absence of communications leading therefrom to vital objectives in Thai-land. Should, however, the Japanese take over aerodromes in the most westerlyprovince of Indo-China, they would acquire air bases within 400 miles ofRangoon.30. It is believed that the French are proposing to withdraw all their troops from the south to the north of Indo-China, with the exception of a &quot;token&quot;force at Cap St. Jacques, guarding the entrance to Saigon.AIR SITUATION.General Review.31. Attacks on industrial and other targets in Germany and in occupied territory were on a heavier scale than in the previous week A particularly heavyraid was made on Hanover.German activity over this country remained at a low level.Our aircraft from Malta inflicted heavjr losses on enemy shipping in theMediterranean.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.32. Bomber Command despatched 157 sorties compared with 102 last week,and dropped 44 tons of H.E. bombs and 124 incendiaries by day. fighter command flew 2,270 aircraft sorties.33. Blenheims, escorted by fighters, successfully attacked several targets in Northern France and in Holland. A shell factory in Marquise, near Boulogne,was bombed on two occasions by a total of eleven Blenheims; bombs fell close tothe factory and on a nearby railway junction where much traffic had been previously observed. The docks at Boulogne were attacked by eleven Blenheims,which scored hits on buildings on the east side of No. 5 Dock. The Fives steel and Engineering Works at Lille were bombed by nine aircraft which, in spite of heavy A.A. fire, dropped bombs across the northern end of the works. Sixaircraft scored several hits on the railway centre at Hazebrouck, where A.A. firewas intense and accurate. Among other targets attacked were the aerodromes at Alkmaar in Holland, and at Longueness, near St. Omer; bursts were seen on both aerodromes, and on a hangar at Alkmaar.34. Two Fortress bombers attacked the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at Brest.Results were difficult to observe owing to heavy A.A. fire, but one of the eight1,100-lb. bombs which were released was seen to burst in the dock area, and it isbelieved that the others fell in the town.35. In addition to providing escorts for bombers, Fighter command aircraft carried out offensive sweeps over Northern France and attackedobjectives in Brittany. During these operations we lost thirty fighters, but threepilots were rescued; casualties inflicted on the enemy totalled 61 fighters destroyed, 18 probably destroyed and 35 damaged.Night.36. Bomber Command despatched 878 sorties compared with 675 in theprevious week.  Operations were carried out on five nights only, the programmes
for the other two being cancelled as a result of unfavourable weather. The main objectives were industrial and railway centres and dockyards in Germany, anddocks in the Low Countries and in Northern France. Nearly 900 tons of HE.bombs, including several of the heaviest type, and 65,000 incendiaries were dropped. Our aircraft encountered intense A.A. fire and exceptional searchlightactivity.37. Duisburg was attacked on three nights by a total of eighty-two aircraft,which dropped 110 tons of H.E. bombs and nearly 10,000. incendiaries. several large fires were started, including a large oil fire on the west bank of the river,and two in the railway yards. Cologne, which was attacked on two nights,received 135 tons of H.E. bombs and 12,000 incendiaries. Hits were obtained onfactories, and on the main railway station, on or near which fell two heavybombs, one of 4,000 lbs. and one of 2,000 lbs.   Several large fires were seen.38. The heaviest weight of bombs was released on Hanover, on which over192 tons of H.E. bombs and 16,500 incendiaries were dropped. In spite of a heavy A.A. barrage and exceptional searchlight activity, hits were obtained onthe goods station and on a factory. Two large areas were on fire in the middle ofthe town, and the woods to the east of the town were also set alight.39. An attack on Kiel took place in extremely bad weather and only a few of the sixty-eight aircraft despatched were able to identify their targets.Eighty-two tons of H.E. bombs were dropped and several fires were observed.40. Other targets hit included the railway centre and Focke-Wulf airframefactory at Bremen and the railway station at Brunswick. A large factory was set on fire at dusseldorf.41. Successful attacks were also made on docks in the occupied territories.Bursts were observed across the docks at Rotterdam and three fires were started inthe Waalhaven. At Dunkirk incendiaries started several large fires, whichmerged into one large conflagration which was visible many miles out to sea, while at Havre the Basin Vauban was hit several times.42. Havocs of Fighter Command and Blenheims and Hudsons of coastal command attacked aerodromes in Northern France and in Holland. Results were generally unobserved except at Soesterburg, where bombs were seen to fall on theflare-path.United Kingdom.43. Fighter Command flew 844 patrols (3,450 sorties) by day, and 438 patrols(517 sorties) by night; the latter totals include dusk and dawn operations.Shipping patrols and cross-channel offensive operations again account for thebulk of our effort.44. Enemy activity by day has been negligible, only nine aircraft havingbeen plotted over the coast. Shipping reconnaissance aircraft and night fightershave operated each night, but on the same small scale as during the last few weeks.Apart from Hull, which was attacked on one night, no concentration was made-on any target. ,   .Coastal Operations.45. Coastal Command flew 238 patrols (350 sorties) and provided escortsfor 85 convoys (301 additional sorties). Shipping,protection patrols carried outby Fighter Command totalled 683 (1,445 sorties).46. Aircraft of Bomber, Fighter and Coastal Commands have continued their successful attacks on enemy shipping. A merchant vessel of 2,000 tons which was attacked off Heligoland from 50 feet by three Blenheims received twodirect hits and was left in flames and in a sinking condition. A tanker of6,000 tons off Le Touquet was attacked by a Beaufort and probably torpedoed.A Hudson on patrol off the Southern Coast of Norway hit a 1,000-ton merchant vessel, and a Blenheim machine-gunned two merchant vessels of 4,000 tons eachand two of 800 tons off the Alsboen Light.
47. Several trawlers were also attacked and three of about 300 tons each were sunk off the Dutch Coast. &apos; Another was hit by incendiaries and set on fire, andothers were machine-gunned. Two reporting vessels were bombed north ofNordeney, and a third was set on fire north-west of Ijmuiden.. 48. Aircraft of Fighter Command scored several hits on barges and armeddrifters off Ostend, and one vessel was left sinking. &quot; E &quot; boats off Calais andLe Touquet were also attacked, and a Whirlwind scored hits on a trawler leavingCherbourg.49. Twenty-three aircraft laid mines in the Baltic, off the Frisian Islands,Boulogne, Brest, St. Nazaire, Lorient and in the Maas Estuary.50. No enemy minelaying was reported during the week. Attacks by aircraft on our shipping off the East Coast are referred to in the Naval Section.Central Mediterranean.51. Blenheim and Swordfish aircraft from Malta have continued their day and night offensive against enemy shipping between Sicily and the African coast,with the following results : Destroyer torpedoed, almost certainly sunk.4,000-ton Tanker bombed and seen to explode.4,000-ton Tanker bombed and left on fire.-   800-ton Schooner bombed and left on fire.800-ton Schooner bombed and left with a heavy list.6,000-ton Merchant Vessel torpedoed and almost certainly sunk.3,000-ton Merchant Vessel torpedoed and almost certainly sunk.3,000-ton Merchant Vessel torpedoed.&quot;   8,000-ton Merchant Vessel sunk by bombs and torpedo.9,000-ton Merchant Vessel torpedoed, beached and subsequently set on fire by bombs.6,000-ton Tanker torpedoed, left on fire.On one occasion enemy fighters successfully prevented a day attack on a convoy,but during the night a successful torpedo attack was made by Swordfish.52. Three heavy night attacks were made on the harbour at Catania. TheContral and Port Railway Stations were hit, and a fire, apparently oil fed, wasvisible 70 miles away. Shipping was almost certainly damaged, and photographs show a large burnt out area among trucks and cargo on the Central Quay.Barracks at Passero were also bombed and left on fire. Fighters carried out highand low level sweeps over Southern Sicily, but no fighter opposition was encountered. Seven seaplanes were destroyed or severely damaged at Syracuse,where oil cisterns were attacked with cannon fire and three balloons were shot down in flames.53. Tripoli (L) was attacked on two nights by a total of nine Wellingtons,but, though bursts and fires were seen on the Spanish Mole, accurate observationwas hampered by a smoke screen. A Maryland engaged in leaflet dropping overTunisia was shot down by French fighters.54. The enemy made a few ineffective night raids on Malta. On the19th August twelve enemy fighters approached the Island, but were chased backto Sicily, where three of them were destroyed. On the 21st at dawn three fighterswith nine others as high cover attempted a low flying attack on two aerodromes,but caused no damage. Our fighters were unable to engage them owing to badvisibility.Egypt and Cyrenaica.55. Wellingtons made two heavy night attacks, totalling 53 sorties, - onBenghazi and on enemy aerodromes at Berca and Benina. Bombs were seen toburst among hangars and dispersed aircraft, and the control office at Benina was set on fire.   At Benghazi bursts were seen on the. Central and Cathedral Moles
and on railway sidings. An attack was also made on Bardia, where a submarine was reported to be lying, but, apart from a fire near the mole, no results couldbe observed.56. No important offensive operations were undertaken by day except onthe 16th and 20th August, when a total of 30 mary lands bombed gun positionseast of Tobruk and tank concentrations near Bardia. During these operationsour fighters provided escort and attacked enemy advanced landing grounds.Tomahawks and Hurricanes made several daylight sweeps without encounteringopposition, and covered our coast-wise shipping. An attack on one of our convoysby 3 Me. 110s escorted by 13 Me. 109s was broken up, and the enemy jettisonedhis bombs. Two mary lands returning from a shipping reconnaissance betweenDerna and Crete bombed an enemy camp near Bardia, obtaining hits among tentsand M.T. vehicles.57. The enemy has continued his attacks on Tobruk and Mersa Matruh,principally by night. Slight material damage was done, and there were a fewcasualties. Mines were also dropped, resulting in the temporary closure of the harbour at Mersa Matruh. Attacks were made on the camp at Moascar andon the R.A.F. Station at Ismailia. Four aircraft and a small oil dump were destroyed, and buildings were slightly damaged. On the night of the 18th/ 19th.and on two following nights, bombs and mines were dropped in Alexandria andthe Canal Zone, but without causing serious damage or casualties.Greece and Eastern Mediterranean.58. On the night of the 13th/14th the Corinth Canal was attacked by32 Wellingtons, four of which also bombed Heraklion Aerodrome, Crete. Thereis good reason to believe that, as a result of these attacks, the canal is blockedReconnaissance nights were made from Egypt over Crete and Greece, and shipping searches were made between Crete and Bardia.On the 14th, eight enemy aircraft bombed Larnaca and Limassol in Cyprus,damaging two factories, and on the 21st Famagusta was attacked by three italian aircraft. Bombs fell on A.A. gun positions, in the town and in the sea, and therewere some military and civilian casualties. ,East Africa.59. A total of 96 sorties were flown by Royal Air Force and South. AfricanAir Force aircraft against enemy positions in the Gondar, Wolchefit and Debarechareas. Hits were observed on the fort at Debarech, the depot at Gondar, and onhangars at Azozo Aerodrome.   No enemy aircraft were encountered,Russia.A ir Operations.60. The continuation of air activity on an intensive scale is undoubtedlyhaving its effect on the German Air Force. It is proving impossible to provideclose support, particularly fighter protection, on the scale that is required. Thereis little doubt that concentrations of effort can at the present time only be madeat a limited number of points and that the transfer of close support units fromone sector of the front to another is being found necessary. Apart from theabove, which arises largely from the enormous length of the front, it must beexpected that units will have to be withdrawn for re-forming. This will probablybe done on a gradual scale, but nevertheless will have an appreciable effect on thescale of operations that can be carried out.61. The very considerable long-range bomber force on the Russian front isbeing largely employed for tactical bombing, as opposed to its normal role. this may be due in part to the continued resistance of the Russian Air Force, whichlimits the range of bombers during daylight to that of the fighters. Generally,the German Air Force has been able to provide very adequate support to thearmy during the whole campaign. On the other hand, it is clear that the[22840]- &apos; c
resistance of the Soviet Air Force has been far more formidable than was anticipated, and the Russian air raids on Berlin seem to have come as a completesurprise to the GermansRussian Air Defence System.62. Members of the British Military Mission in Moscow recently paid a visitat night to a mobile A.A. battery, consisting of four 76 mm. guns stationed about11 miles north-west of Moscow in the neighbourhood of Tushino. Single enemy aircraft were raiding Moscow sporadically on that evening. The guns put up abarrage fire at a height of 16,000 ft. The barrages are fired at varying heightsby order of the regimental H.Q. The instruments at the gun position included a height and range-finder predictor of Russian make and illuminated dials on the guns electrically connected to the predictor. The guns and instruments were inshallow pits, with the guns in a semi-circle around the predictor, about 25 yardsaway. A few Russian night fighters were up most of the time. In normal circumstances they seem to operate outside the barrage zone, but if chasing anenemy aircraft they can penetrate it, relying on the very distinctive sound of theirengines or on recognition signals to avoid being shot at.63. The members of the Mission were impressed by the density of the gunsand lights. The main ring of guns and lights seems to be about 15 miles fromthe centre of the city. The lights are occasionally grouped, but are not workedas clusters. One enemy aircraft was picked up by lights on that night and held for a long time by about fifteen searchlights.64. It seems that the principle on which the Russians have based theirground defence from air attack is a thick light and barrage hedge with aradius of some 15 miles, backed up by inlying batteries, which include a largenumber of light A.A. guns, sited to guard vulnerable points. The expenditureon ammunition is very great.Soviet Raids on Roumanian Targets.65.   It has now been possible for members of the British Air Mission in moscow to study an air photograph of the Ploesti refineries of the Astra andUnirea Companies taken on the afternoon of the 13th July, 1941, following tworaids which were made on the previous night.   Many fires were plainly visible,mostly in the area of the Unirea refinery.   Details of the damage are as follows : &apos;(a) Many tank cars were hit in the Unirea Refinery.   Four tanks containingbetween 2,500 and 5,000 tons each were hit and the escaping oil wasburning over the surrounding area.   The main line railway tracks hadbeen hit in the vicinity of the refinery, while in another part of the installation two tanks containing approximately 2,500 tons of oil hadbeen hit and several smaller ones damaged.(&amp;) In the Astra refinery area, six small and three medium (up to 5,000 tons)tanks were hit in the north-west corner of the refinery area close tothe cracking units. The escaped oil had spread the fire. A direct hit on a tank of about 5,000 tons was registered in another part ofthe plant and three smaller tanks were also destroyed.&quot;Three.bombs landed nearer to the centre of the plant and a firecould be distinguished in or close to the boiler station and electric power house, while adjoining buildings of lesser importance appearto be damaged. A tank car train was cut in two and many carsdamaged or destroyed.The Russians claim that they damaged or destroyed 200 tankcars and 10 medium (up to 5,000 tons) tanks and 25 small (up to1,000 tons) tanks. Excluding damage by splinters, and other minor damage, it is thought that the Russians only destroyed or damaged100 tank cars, while about 25 or 26 tanks were damaged or destroyed.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.66.   Bombs were dropped on three days of the week only.The 16th August produced the most noteworthy incidents. In the earlyafternoon the Montrose-South Esk Viaduct was hit and several nearby housesdemolished. The main east coast line was blocked probably for two weeks, but asatisfactory diversion is in use. Later in the day a distillery at Banff was hit,and set on fire, and 60,000 gallons of whisky were destroyed.Next day the main Edinburgh-Newcastle line was closed for seven hours bya U.X.B. at Innerwick, near Dunbar, and one of a repair gang was killed bymachine-gun fire.By Night.67. Bombing attacks, very similar in character to the previous week, tookplace each night of the week. The east, coast counties of England and scotland were mostly affected, and a large proportion of bombs in these scattered attacks were of an anti-personnel type.The most serious attack took place at Hull on 17th/18th August, whennearly 200 houses and shops were demolished or seriously damaged and 20 peoplekilled, but the attack was neither long nor heavy.The following night 19 people were killed in a smaller attack on WestHartlepool, and there was some bombing in the Tyneside and Tees-side areas.At Middlesbrough, the slag disposal plant of Dorman Long&apos;s Steel Works wasextensively damaged, and it is thought that production will be reduced for atime to one-third.On 17th/18th, the Duke of York&apos;s Military School at Dover was damaged by shell fire, and on 19th/20th workshops of the Southern Railway boatyard inDover harbour were seriously damaged by bombs, whilst others damaged thequayside at Wellington dockhead.Casualties.68. During the week ending 0600 on the 20th August, 66 people were killed and 42 seriously injured.No casualties occurred in London.[228401D

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and intelligence sources : *Germany.Berlin. On the night of the 2nd/3rd August members of the Hitler Youthwere called out to assist the civil and fire defence services, whose personnel wasnot at full strength owing to holidays. Damage was mainly in the suburbs, andwas most severe in the districts of Ruhleben, Charlottenburg, Moabit andNeubabelsberg near Potsdam. In order to make ambulances less conspicuous regulation has been issued prohibiting the ringing of bells on ambulances called out during and after air raids.Cologne. /The German papers, both national and local, have always been most carefully censored so as to. give no information of damage caused in raids.It is therefore of considerable interest that for the first time some evidence of damage at Cologne has been obtained from this source, and it is thought this isindication of the severe dislocation that must have been caused in this city inrecent raids. . .&apos;.&quot;&apos;      &apos;France.LoHent. Tn the raid of the 4th/5th July the torpedo section at the Arsenalwas damaged and the main railway line between Lorient and Hennebont station was destroyed in several places by direct hits. The Germans themselves causedfurther damage to these tracks with their dynamite charges in attemptingunsuccessfully to destroy a bomb that had failed to explode.Le Trait. Photographs taken during the daylight attack on the 12th Augustshow six bomb bursts in the target area and a believed direct hit on a merchant vessel under construction. The damage caused in the previous raid on the22nd July is clearly shown on these photographs.Brest.-In the raid of the 4th/5th July considerable damage was caused to railway property in the port area. There were five direct hits on the tracks to paris just outside the main station.Italy.Further reports of the last two attacks on Naples state that two trampsteamers were sunk and the cruisers Giuseppe Garibaldi and Ducd Degli Abruzzieach received a, hit on the stern. The Giornale d&apos;Italia of the 13th June statesthat in the previous year there were 70 air raids in which bombs were dropped and three naval bombardments. The total damage to private and public buildings (excluding damage to railway and industrial property, furniture andfittings) amounts to about  1,250,000 at pre-war rate of exchange.
