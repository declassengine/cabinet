Hon. Winston S. Churchill, M.P.General C. de Gaulle.Secretary: Captain C. M. Berkeley, Offices of the War Cabinet.1. General de Gaulle^ attitude towards Britain.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had witnessed with very greatsorrow the deterioration in General de Gaulle&apos;s attitude towards His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. He now felt that he was no longer dealing with a friend. Hehad received a letter from General de Gaulle on the subject of a recent pressinterview. Clearly an important person whose utterances carried weight wasoften in danger of being taken advantage of by newspaper correspondents. Butquite apart from this matter, the Prime Minister had received evidence from many sources that General de Gaulle had throughout his recent travels left atrail of Anglophobia behind him. This was a most serious matter in all thecircumstances, and the Prime Minister had been greatly pained by the accumula-tion of evidence he had received.GENERAL de GAULLE said that it could not be seriously maintained that he was an enemy of Great Britain. His position and previous record made it inconceivable. He would, however, say frankly that recent events, especiallyin Syria, had profoundly disturbed him and cast doubts in his mind as to the
attitude of many British authorities towards him and the Free French Movement.These events, added to the great difficulties of his personal position, to hisisolation, and no doubt to the factor of his personal temperament, had led himto utterances which must clearly have been disagreeable to British ears. he wished to express his frank regret for these utterances.2: Syria.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had been at great pains beforeGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s arrival in Egypt to make it clear to all concerned that theGeneral was the man he trusted and the man with whom he proposed to work.Everything had been done to smooth the path before General de Gaulle.No doubt there had been faults on the British side in handling relations,and he could well believe that General de Gaulle had suffered some annoyances.To some extent hitches of this nature were unavoidable, but General de Gaulleknew that he could appeal to the Prime Minister at any moment, and that effortswould at once be made to smooth out any difficulty. Instead General de gaulle had become increasingly antagonistic, and had made no communication to thePrime Minister.GENERAL de GAULLE reminded the Prime Minister of his message ofthe 28th June, in which he had stated that any breach over Syria would havethe most serious consequences on the Free French Movement. On his arrival in syria he soon realised that many of the British authorities had no conception ofthe status of the Free French Movement. He found himself surrounded with political and military authorities who to all appearances had it as their aim to diminish the role of the Free French in Syria. His representatives had enduredcountless humiliations, and the agreements he had entered into with the Ministerof State, apparently to their mutual satisfaction, had remained a dead letter fora whole fortnight.In normal circumstances difficulties of this sort between two countries wouldbe smoothed out in a moment by their Ambassadors. At a time when France wasbroken and humiliated, his own efforts to vindicate her must fail if he met withsuch treatment.THE PRIME MINISTER explained Britain&apos;s attitude in regard to Syria.Britain had no ambitions of any sort in that country, and no desire whatever tosupplant France. Her one object was the defeat of Hitler, there and everywhere,and nothing must stand in the way of that purpose. Syria was an important unit in the Arab world, as well as one of the military factors in the defence of Egypt.We could not allow a repetition of events in Syria, the repercussions of which inadjacent territories endangered our military position. It followed that we hadto be in control in Syria for all purposes connected with the winning of the war.That, he repeated, was the sole purpose that had brought us there.Clearly the securing of our position in the Arab world involved a transferof many of the functions previously exercised by France in Syria to the Syrians
themselves. The position of France in respect of Syria after the war would be different from that which had obtained before the war, not because Britain wouldhave acquired some of the powers previously exercised by France, but becauseFrance would have voluntarily transferred a large part of those powers to theSyrians. That was essential. The Arabs saw no sense in driving out the VichyFrench only to be placed under the control of the Free French. They desired their independence, and had been promised it.Once again Britain sought no selfish advantage, pursued no Imperialambitions, in Syria. She recognised that France had been pre-eminent in Syriain the past and that she would still remain pre-eminent there, as compared withother European countries, after the war, though many of her former powers would have been surrendered. The only British object and this applied asmuch to Jibuti as to Syria was to prosecute the war; but for that purpose wecould not tolerate any development which rendered our task more difficult, andwhich might invoke loss of time, effort and even lives.GENERAL de GAULLE denied that he entertained any suspicions of selfishBritish motives in Syria. Although British and French policies towards theArab world were not the same, in Syria or elsewhere, there could be no dis-agreement on the principles laid down by the Prime Minister, and it was he himself who had promised the Syrians their independence.Similarly he had always recognised the fact that the ultimate military controlmust rest in British hands. This principle, laid down in the agreements ofthe 7th August, 1940, had been confirmed in his recent negotiations with theMinister of State and had been scrupulously respected though the british authorities in Syria had not met this Free French willingness to accept thegeneral authority of their High Command in any helpful or accommodatingspirit.The question was not one of principle on which there was no disagreement but one of method, regarding which he maintained that the Free French in Syriahad been subjected to constant and unnecessary humiliations.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would be ashamed to use the Britishpower, which in Syria was overwhelming, for any purpose not essential to the defeat of Hitler. For any such purpose, however, as to assure the necessarydegree of security, he would not hesitate to use the full power at our disposalagainst any one, in the knowledge that he would thus be serving the common cause.GENERAL de GAULLE said that it was natural and good that british forces whose overwhelming preponderance over the Free French in Syria he didnot contest should be used in all cases where their use would contribute to the defeat of the common foe.THE PRIME MINISTER said that matters now seemed to be going moresmoothly in Syria and that the relations between General Catroux and the british military Authorities were now satisfactory.
He wished to reiterate the point, however, that the British Command couldnot allow itself to be exposed to dangers which might have been warded off, suchas local risings, which might spread to adjacent territories. Further, the politicalsituation in Syria must be so handled as to give the Arab world a real measureof satisfaction. He went on to outline the possible course of events in the middle east in the future, and gave General de Gaulle an estimate of the huge forces wewere building up in that area. The British Government were determined tomaintain a position which would permit them to hurl the totality of their forces against the enemy when the time came, without having to divert a portion ofthose forces for the purpose of maintaining the security of the territories uponwhich we were based. Nothing could be allowed to interfere with the prosecu-tion of the war, and that principle was the touchstone of British policy as far asSyria was concerned.GENERAL de GAULLE said that he fully appreciated what the PrimeMinister had said. The Free French would abide by their promises to the arabs and would play their part in future campaigns, placing their full resourcesresolutely at the side of the British armies.THE PRIME MINISTER assured General de Gaulle that he was notunmindful of the importance to the common cause of so treating the Free FrenchMovement in Syria as to make the French nation realise that General de Gaullewas the guardian of its interests in Syria, and that those interests were pre-eminent as compared with those of other European countries. To strengthenGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s position in France, he would particularly bear in mind theGeneral&apos;s position as defender of the historic connection between France and syria.GENERAL de GAULLE said that he had much evidence to show that thenecessity for the Syrian campaign had been understood in France, and that ithad led to no stirring of anti-British or anti-Free French feeling.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had been anxious that developments in Syria should not damage General de Gaulle&apos;s standing in French eyes. It wasno part of British policy to belittle the Free French contribution to the Syriancampaign.GENERAL de GAULLE said that he hoped the Prime Minister hadreceived, together with less welcome reports, echoes of the very deep and sincereadmiration for the British Imperial forces which he had repeatedly expressedin the past few weeks.3. Jibuti.THE PRIME MINISTER then turned to the question of Jibuti. He put the hypothetical case that the Governor might be willing to surrender to theBritish but not to the Free French, or that he might make it a condition of surrender that the territory would not subsequently be handed over to the Free
French. The territory was at present being severely blockaded, but passive resistance might not break down for several months. If such a condition wereto be put, would General de Gaulle wish to proceed with this somewhat incon-venient conflict, or would he be prepared to accept the terms and to secure themilitary use of this important territory for the Allies for the rest of the war ?GENERAL de GAULLE said that he attached little importance to the formof the surrender. It might well be that, for reasons of prestige, the vichy government might impose conditions such as those the Prime Minister had outlined. Those conditions need not, in his judgment, be taken too seriously, andit would be of some importance to avoid giving the enemy an excuse for alleging,as he had done in the case of Syria, that once again British greed had prevailedover the Free French cause. Subject to that proviso, he attached little importanceto the actual terms. He asked, however, that the details of the administrationof the territory after the surrender should be settled in advance by agreementbetween the British and Free French Authorities.In practice the terms of surrender would no doubt leave His Majesty&apos;sGovernment free to make what arrangements they saw fit for the subsequentadministration of the territory.4. The Free French Movement.THE PRIME MINISTER then turned to the question of the leadership ofthe Free French Movement. He had come to the conclusion that it would be in theFree French interest if a formal Council were created, which would have an effective voice in shaping the policy of the Movement of which General de Gaullewas the head as the recognised leader of all Free Frenchmen.GENERAL de GAULLE agreed that there would be some advantage in hishaving about him some body analogous to a government. He had given the mattera good deal of thought, but there were some difficulties. A Council such as thePrime Minister had suggested would only be of value if it consisted of reallyrepresentative persons. Such representatives would be difficult to find, in viewof the profound revolution now in progress in France. Moreover, if the free french Movement had awakened an echo in the people of France, the reason was largely that it was a movement marked by a very high degree of unanimity. Thatunanimity had been achieved by avoiding all contact with politics and basing thewhole Movement upon the continuance of the struggle against the common foe.The creation of a representative Council would inevitably bring political factorsinto play, and the unanimity of the Movement might thereby be endangered. Hewould, however, give the whole question very careful thought. He was alreadyexamining the possibility of summoning a Free French Congress of representativesof all the territories which had rallied to the Movement, early next year. some form of Conseil de Gouvernement might, perhaps, emerge from that Congress,which would provide the Movement with a democratic basis.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had a double object in view : toencourage General de Gaulle&apos;s supporters in France, and therefore to do nothing which would diminish General de Gaulle&apos;s stature as the champion of continuedresistance to the enemy; and at the same time to improve relations between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Free French Movement by giving the latter a broader basis. He believed that the latter purpose would be served by the creationof a Council, with whom His Majesty&apos;s Government would then deal. He was glad to hear that General de Gaulle proposed to give this matter his earnestattention.In conclusion, the PRIME MINISTER asked General de Gaulle to realisehow important it was to give no ground to the suspicion that he (the General)entertained hostile thoughts towards Great Britain, or even thoughts that might subsequently take on a hostile character. He wished to press this advice upon theGeneral, because already some British figures entertained a suspicion that general de Gaulle had become hostile and had moved towards certain Fascist views whichwould not be helpful to collaboration in the common cause.GENERAL de GAULLE said that he would give the utmost weight to thePrime Ministers advice. He did not think that the accusation of authoritarianviews could be maintained in the light of his most recent statements and of certain further statements he proposed to make. He begged the Prime Minister to under-stand that the leaders and members of the Free French Movement were necessarilysomewhat difficult people; else they would not be where they were. If this difficultcharacter sometimes coloured their attitude towards their great ally, in so far asdaily actions and utterances were concerned, he could rest assured that their entireloyalty to Great Britain remained unimpaired.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would be glad to see general de Gaulle again at some future time if the latter wished. If the Ministerof State came home, a meeting a trois might be convenient.September 16, 1941.
