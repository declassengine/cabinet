(41) 585)September 25, 1941TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINETRESUME(No. 108)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 0700 September 18th, to0700 September 25th,1941[Circulated with the approval dfthe Chiefs of Staff.]
naval SITUATION.General Review.1.   There has been no outstanding event at sea during the period.U-boat attacks on three convoys have resulted in our shipping losses beingheavier than last week, though still slightly below the weekly average for the war.Home Waters.2. On the 18th an enemy aircraft, which was shadowing a convoy off Flam-borough Head, was probably destroyed by H.M. Destroyer Westminster. On thesame day aircraft from Fighter Command sank or seriously damaged fourminesweepers off Ostend. On the following evening, off the East Coast, H.M.Armed Merchant Cruiser City of Durban was hit by a bomb which failed toexplode; H.M. Destroyer Valorous shot down one of the attacking aircraft.During the night of the 20th/21st two coastal convoys off the Wash wereunsuccessfully attacked by six E-boats, two of which were claimed to be damaged by the escorting destroyers.Rattray Head Lighthouse was damaged by aircraft on the 20th.It is estimated that 6,200 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk and over40,000 tons damaged by our aircraft; details are given under Air Situation.H.M. the King of the Hellenes arrived in England in s.s. Durban Castleescorted by two destroyers on the 22nd.North Atlantic.3t On the 19th HM. Canadian Corvette Levis, on escort duty with a home-bound convoy from Canada, was torpedoed and sunk 130 miles east of CapeFarewell (Greenland).Northern Waters.4. On the 12th the Russian submarine K. 2 sank a westbound laden merchant ship of 3,000-4,000 tons 40 miles north of Varanger Fjord. HM. SubmarineTigris sank a 2,000-ton merchant ship in Rolvsoy Sound (West of North Cape) onthe 13th. On the 17th she attacked and probably damaged a 3,000-ton ship inthe entrance to Kraenanger Fjord.J an Mayen Island has been occupied by a Free Norwegian expedition.Mediterranean.5. Between the 7th and 14th of September HM. Submarine Thunderbolt, on patrol off the Libyan coast, torpedoed three merchant ships of 1,500-5,000 tonsand a small minelayer.During the night of the 18th/19th our submarines carried out a successful attack on an enemy convoy consisting of three large liners escorted by destroyers,35 miles north-east of Tripoli (L). One liner was sunk and the s.s. Vulcania(24,469 tons) was damaged.During the week Blenheim and Swordfish aircraft from Malta have sunk or seriously damaged 45,000 tons of enemy shipping between Sicily and the african coast.   An enemy destroyer was also seriously damaged off Tripoli (L).At 0800 on the 20th explosions occurred in the R.F.A. Tanker Denbydale(8,145 tons) in Gibraltar harbour, and in the s.s. Durham (10,803 tons) and theoiling hulk Fiona Shell anchored in the Bay. The attacks appear to have beenmade by one-man submarines as a breathing apparatus was recovered in thevicinity. The Denbydale was seriously damaged, Durham was beached and theFiona Shell sank.During the week eleven French Merchant ships (upwards of 32,000 tons)westbound and five (13,120 tons) eastbound, have passed through the Strait of gibraltar under escort.On the 22nd three French submarines and a sloop passed westbound.
Red Sea.6. The French launch Rewak, carrying petrol for Jibouti, has been inter-cepted and taken in prize to Zeilah.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. H.M. Destroyer Vim,y, 500 miles south-west of Cape Finisterre, attacked a U-boat and possibly damaged it.Aircraft attacks have been carried out south-west of Iceland (C), north-west of the Hebrides, and west of Brest, without definite results.Enemy Intelligence.8. It is reported by reconnaissance that the battleship Tirpitz and the pocket-battleship Admiral Scheer have been carrying out exercises in thewestern Baltic; otherwise all the larger German surface units have been locatedduring the week, and no important change has taken place in their dispositions.Reports have been received that the large liners Roma (30,816 tons) andAugustus (30,418 tons) are being converted into aircraft-carriers at Genoa.U-Boats.9. About thirty German U-Boats have been operating during the week. one large group has resumed operations to the south-east of Greenland, and others have been operating on the convoy routes to the west of Ushant and west of theCanaries.Oil Storage in Northern Norway.10. The storage cisterns at Ramsf jordnes (Tromso area) which were being built in 1939 for the Norwegian Navy are reported to be now completed. Thereare said to be 3 cisterns, each of 4,000 tons capacity. There is, in addition, storagefor 10,700 tons of black oils at this place. Between mid-June and mid-July last16,000 tons of aviation spirit are reported to have been unloaded at Ramsf jord.Russian Intelligence.11. Five more Russian submarines have passed to Northern Waters throughthe White Sea Canal, thus making a total of twelve which have passed the canal. With these twelve the number of Russian submarines in the extremeNorth is now twenty-six.On the 21st September two Soviet minesweeping tugs, with 60 naval personnel, including 15 officers, arrived off the Stockholm archipelago. these ships had left Dagkuri (north of Oesel) after dark on the previous day in company with other Soviet ships, which were, however, sunk in an attack by Germantorpedo craft.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.12. During the week under review U-boats have made determined attacks on three convoys. Four ships were torpedoed, three of which are reported sunk,in a homeward bound convoy from Canada off the east coast of Greenland. three ships were torpedoed in an outward bound convoy which was attacked on twosuccessive nights to the west of Ushant. A homeward bound convoy from sierra leone was attacked three times on two successive nights to the west of theCanaries and four ships were torpedoed, of which three are believed sunk.Details of attacks on these convoys may be incomplete. Two ships were mined and sunk in the Thames Approaches, and another was damaged off milford haven. An Isle of Wight Ferry steamer was sunk by an explosion, presumed tohave been caused by a mine, outside Portsmouth harbour; between, twenty andtwenty-five persons are missing. Three ships were damaged by bombing off theEast coast, one of which subsequently sank. A rescue vessel, with survivors fromthe torpedoed ships in the outward bound convoy previously attacked by U-boats,was bombed and set on fire by Focke-Wulf aircraft when 550 miles north-east[22947] b
of the Azores, and was subsequently sunk by our own gunfire; ninety-nine sur-survivors, twenty of whom were seriously wounded, were picked up, but the masterand twenty-nine of the crew are missing. The Focke-Wulf was destroyed by fighter aircraft from the escorting anti-aircraft ship.It has now been ascertained that fifteen ships (62,662 tons) were sunk andone is missing in the homeward bound convoy attacked by U-boats off Greenlandon the 10th and 11th September.Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. During the week ending the 24th September, 1,133 ships, including230 allied and 25 neutral, were convoyed. Five armed merchant cruisers, fiveanti-aircraft ships, seventy-five destroyers (including 15 United States destroyers)and ninety-three sloops, corvettes and minesweepers were employed on escort duties. Since the beginning of the war 82,185 ships have been convoyed, of which409 have been lost by enemy action.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the20th September totalled 775,903 tons compared with an average of 909,348 tons during the past ten weeks. Oil imports totalled 236,080 tons; mineral imports were 223,419 tons, of which 115,838 were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore.Timber and wood pulp imports were 64,584 tons, copra and palm oil 22,296 tonsand cereals 66,331 tons, of which 6,500 tons were rice. Other food importsamounted to 106,803 tons of which the principal commodities, in tons, were :refrigerated and tinned meats, bacon and hams 33,239, sugar 26.784, lard and fats 8,270, cocoa 6,841, evaporated milk 6,032, fruit 3,871, jam and honey 2,774,eggs 2,040, tea 1,580, cheese 1.099. Three consignments of tobacco totalled1,151 tons. &apos; Among satisfactory arrivals of machinery were 1,006 tons of machine tools.British Minelaying.14. A series of minelaying operations have been carried out off the Dutch,Belgian and French Channel coasts during the week. In addition mines havebeen laid off the Butt of Lewis.No aircraft minelaying has taken place.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.15. During the period under review minelaying by enemy aircraft has takenplace in the Thames Estuary, on the East Coast possibly as far north asFlamborough Head, and off Fahnouth and Milford Haven. During the weekthirty-five acoustic and four magnetic mines have been destroyed in the Estuary,twenty-five of which were in the Barrow Deep. The mine totals to date aremagnetic 1,424; acoustic 1,034; contact 1,061.Enemy Merchant Shipping.16. During August, seven enemy merchant vessels larger than 1,000 tonsattempted to pass through the Straits of Dover, four eastbound and three west-bound. This shows a striking reduction compared with the eighteen vessels whichattempted to pass through the Straits of Dover in July.According to foreign broadcasts the Norwegian ships Richard With, 905 tons,and Baroy, 424 tons, have been sunk off the coast of Norway. The NorwegianVard, 681 tons, is also reported to have been attacked and set on fire, but shewas towed into Bergen by a German tug.A broadcast from Lisbon has stated that the Swedish Yarrawonga, 4,900 tons,has been sunk while on a voyage from Germany to Sweden. The crew were savedand taken to Hamburg.The Bulgarian Rodina, 4,159 tons, is reported to have been mined and sunk off Burgas on 19th September.The Italian tanker Celeno, 3,741 tons, bound from the iEgean for the black sea, was expected to call at Istanbul on 23rd or 24th September.The Italian tanker Recca, 5,441 tons, which was seized by the Cuban Govern-ment at the beginning of April, has been incorporated into the Cuban Navy andrenamed Libertad.
In the Persian Gulf the German Hohenfels, 7,862 tons, has been refloatedand beached on an even keel at Bandar Gulf and should be ready for towingin the n^ar future.vichy French Shipping.17. Four tankers escorted by two destroyers sailed from Toulon forConstanza on the 10th September to fetch cargoes of fuel oil. Two Frenchtankers, one of them being the Vendemiaire, 9,228 tons, are reported to have passed the Dardanelles bound for Roumania on the 23rd September. This is thefirst attempt made by the French to fetch oil from the Black Sea since earlyJune, when two tankers were torpedoed by British submarines in the iEgean.If these four tankers succeed in returning to France fully laden, the French oil position will be considerably eased, and Germany will be relieved of the immediatenecessity to supply France&apos;s essential requirements over her already congestedrailways.The French have recently started the convoying of merchant ships sailingbetween Dakar, Madagascar and Indo-China. The first of these convoys sailed from Tamatave for Dakar about the 12th August and consisted of 5 ships totalling 36,767 tons. The second sailed from Saigon for Madagascar on the7th September and consisted of 3 ships of a total of 25,009 tons, two of the shipsbeing eventually bound for France; the cargo included 13,300 tons of coal forMadagascar. Another convoy is believed to be sailing shortly from Diego-Suarezfor Saigon, consisting of 4 ships totalling 28,820 tons; these ships are carryinggeneral cargo from France for the Far East.It was announced on the 10th September that sailings from France to Indo-China would recommence, and the first ship to sail since the 19th July is reportedto have been the Eridan, 9,928 tons, on the 12th September, to be followed by theLouis L.D., 5,795 tons.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.18. No very great change has taken place during the past week. In the leningrad sector stubborn resistance by the Russians is believed to be causing the Germans heavy losses. The Germans are at present on the defensive in theSmolensk sector, where successful local operations have been carried out bythe Russians. In the Ukraine German armoured forces advancing from Glukhovand Kremenchug have met, and are now mopping up the encircled Soviet troopswith the support of infantry divisions. Though some Soviet forces may possibly have avoided encirclement in the initial stages of the operation, there is no doubtthat Russian losses in men and material have been very heavy. Further to thesouth the German advance has cut all land communications with the Crimea.Finland.19. Reports suggest that no advance has been made on this front. On theKarelian Isthmus the Russians are holding the Finnish forces on the general lineof the 1939 frontier.Leningrad Sector.20. The Germans have not materially improved their position, and their operations have been hampered by bad weather. No reports have been received of concentrated air attacks either on the Russian defensive positions or.on the cityitself. The German intention may, therefore, be to contain the city until resistanceweakens and until it can be taken without incurring further heavy losses.Estonia.21. The Germans have established a foothold on the island of Oesel and are reported to be advancing westwards.[22947] b 2
Central Sector.22.   The situation on the front in this sector has not changed.Ukraine.23. German armoured and motorised forces advancing southwards fromGlukhov met those advancing northwards from Kremenchug about a week ago.Though some Russian forces avoided encirclement, the greater part of MarshalBudenny&apos;s forces in the area Glukhov-Kremenchug-Kiev were cut off, and the remnants of this encircled force are now fighting very stubbornly even though there is little prospect of extrication. The German communique of the23rd September claims the capture of 380.000 prisoners and the capture or destruction of 570 tanks and 2,100 guns. While these claims are regarded assomewhat excessive, there can be no doubt that Russian losses in this sector havebeen very severe, and their final extent cannot at present be computed.24. The German forces in the area Glukhov-Kremenchug have consolidatedtheir gains and an advance has been made from the Kremenchug bridgehead inthe direction of Poltava, which is almost half way to Kharkov.25. In the extreme south of the Ukraine, German forces are reported tohave reached the shores of the Sea of Azov. All land communication with the crimea is cut.26. The Russian forces in the Crimea are not believed to be very large. the threat to the naval base of Sebastopol is, therefore, considerable.Comment.27. The present situation has three serious aspects. First, there is the threat to the Donetz Basin which, coupled with the possibility of an advance toRostoy-on-T3on, would bring the Germans a great deal nearer to the Caucasus,one of their chief objectives. Secondly, the capture of the Crimea would mean the loss to the Russians of the naval base of Sebastopol and would consequentlyhave a serious effect on the ability of a Russian Navy to operate in the Black Sea;and thirdly, the possibility of a German offensive in the central sector in orderto destroy the Russian reserves in the Moscow area and cut communications withthe south cannot be excluded.Operations.Libya and Egypt.28. In the Frontier Area the German reconnaissance in force whichcommenced on the 14th September and was referred to in last week&apos;s Resume, wascarried out by two columns advancing parallel to each other south of the escarp-ment. They were harassed by our desert columns, consisting of armoured-carunits and motorised infantry and artillery, which withdrew before the german advance. By the morning of the 15th, however, the enemy forces had commencedto withdraw, and both columns, which had been heavily and successfully bombed by our aircraft while refuelling the previous evening, and engaged by ourartillery, retired to their original positions on the line Halfaya-Sidi Omar.Enemy losses include 20 killed and 28 prisoners of which 16 were Italianairmen 10 tanks and 15 M.T. vehicles destroyed or captured, and 22 aircraft destroyed or captured, with others probably destroyed and damaged. Our ownlosses were 2 killed and 3 missing, one armoured car and several M.T. vehiclesdamaged and 7 aircraft destroyed; 5 of the pilots are safe.29.   Since then operations in the frontier area have been confined to        j,patrolling on both sides and reconnaissance by aircraft, including enemy bomb attacks on the Oases area, Fort Maddalena and Kufra.30. At Tobruk the situation has been far quieter than of late and only two light raids have taken place during the period under review, neither of which caused damage. Shelling also has decreased, with sporadic outbreaks of activity in various sectors, but a heavy sand, storm has been blowing almost continuouslyand has seriously limited patrolling activities.
A abyssinia.31. On the 15th September our troops carried out a successful patrol on theenemy left flank in the Wolchefit area and penetrated a considerable distancebehind the enemy front lines.East Africa.32. The East African Command came into being at 2359 hours14th September.33. A considerable number of Somali refugees (many being British subjects)crossed the frontier from French Somaliland during the week,Persia.34. As a result of the dilatory attitude of the Persian Authorities towardshanding over the Germans, British and Russian forces advanced to Teheran, and reached the outskirts of the city during the afternoon of 17th September, without incident. Contrary to various reports contained in the Press, the capital was&quot;not occupied and both British and Russian forces camped outside.35. Khurdish tribes have taken advantage of the confusion prevailing inthe Persian Army and frontier guards in Persian Khurdistan and have occupiedthe towns of Baneh and Sakiz (about 90 miles N.W. of Kermanshah).Intelligence.France.36. There are indications that the Germans may be forming a new armoured division north of the Gironde. There is no evidence that the new division has so far been equipped with tanks.Balkan States,Roumania.37. A movement of Roumanian troops into the Timok valley district of yugoslavia was reported to be imminent or in progress on 12th September. Itis believed that one division crossed the Danube at Tunru Severin on the night of 9th/10th September, while four other divisions were standing by in the Orsovaarea. The extent of the territory to be occupied is not yet known, nor has anyfurther news of the operation been received. It is to be presumed that territory in Yugoslavia has been offered to Roumania by Germany in return for their continued co-operation in the Russian campaign, which has now becomethoroughly unpopular.Libya.38. It is reported, but not confirmed, that 12,000 German troops passed through the Brenner into Italy during the first week of September. ConsiderableGerman forces are also said to be in Southern Italy being acclimatized for Africa.39. Certain German reinforcements recently arrived in North Africa, but all were non-divisional units belonging to G.H.Q. pool. There may also have been some German troops in the two liners which were sunk on 16th September. Thetotal German forces in Libya are still believed, to be two armoured divisions, ofwhich one is incomplete. There is as yet no evidence that elements of a thirddivision have arrived.AIR SITUATION.General Review.40. The weather during the week was so unfavourable that our night opera-tions against enemy objectives in Germany and Occupied Territory were consider-ably restricted. Gur aircraft continued their attacks on hostile shipping in home Waters and in the Mediterranean.Enemy activity over this country was at a low level.
Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.41. Bomber Command despatched 129 sorties, as compared with 113 lastweek, and dropped 40 tons of HE. bombs and 200 incendiaries. Fighter Com-mand flew 1,663 aircraft sorties in the course of offensive operations over northern france and the Netherlands and against shipping. Attacks on shipping are recorded under &quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;42. The targets attacked included power stations, communications, shipyardsand docks. The electricity power stations at Gosnay, near Bethune, and atGrand Queville, near Rouen, were each attacked by 11 Blenheims. At Gosnay,the power house and the generator station were hit, and at Grand Queville bombsfell in the target area. The railway centres at Abbeville and Hazebrouck were attacked by Hampdens and Blenheims, and both targets were hit several times.The six Blenheims which bombed the Grand Queville shipyard scored hits on buildings in the yard and on an adjoining cellulose factory. The docks at Cher-bourg were attacked by six Blenheims, and bombs were seen to fall in the centre and on the western edge of the Bassin Napoleon. A Fortress bomber dropped-two tons of bombs on Emden. Among other targets attacked were a herring oilfactory at Floro, 70 m. N. of Bergen, and the railway repair shops at Lille, onwhich over five tons of bombs were dropped.43. Offensive operations by Fighter Command were impossible on four days of the week owing to bad weather, but on the other three a total of 84squadron sorties were flown. One of these squadrons destroyed six and probably destroyed two of a number of enemy aircraft which were flying round an aero-drome near Ostend. Total enemy losses during these operations were 58 aircraft destroyed, 18 probably destroyed and 28 damaged. We lost 31 fighters, butfive pilots were rescued.44. An interesting feature of enemy activity during the week has been theincreased activity of single-engine fighter units over the Pas-de-Calais area in opposing our daylight sweeps. During the previous weeks these units had shownlittle inclination to intercept our fighters when they crossed the coast in small numbers. With the increase in the strength of our sweeps during the week theGerman Air Force countered with considerable forces. An increase in thenumber of patrols flown by day over Belgium, Holland and N,W. Germany bytwin-engine fighter units has also been noticeable.Night.45. Owing to unfavourable weather throughout the week, only 230 sorties were despatched by Bomber Command compared with 835 last week, and thetotal of 228 tons of H.E. bombs and 14,300 incendiaries which was released isthe lowest since the week ended the 5th June. All operations were cancelledon three nights, and on another only three aircraft were despatched. the objectives on the remaining nights were the industrial centres of Berlin andFrankfurt.and the docks at Stettin, Ostend and Havre.46. The heaviest attack of the week was made on Stettin, Germany&apos;s mostimportant seaport in the Baltic, which is being used extensively for reinforcements for the Russian campaign. Sixty-four tons of H.E. bombs and 2,400 incendiaries were dropped by 53 aircraft. It was difficult to observe results owing to cloud and haze, but bursts were seen in the centre of the city, on the main railway station and on warehouses in the dock area. There were several fires, including a particularly large one near the railway centre.47. Fifteen tons of HE. bombs and 1,530 incendiaries were dropped on berlin. Bursts were seen at the western end of the Unter den Linden and in theSchoneburg district, and a big fire was started near the Air Ministry. At* Frankfurt, whch was attacked on a lighter scale, hits were obtained on theindustrial and railway centres and on buildings near the General Post Office.48. A total of 60 tons of H.E. bombs and 3,000 incendiaries were dropped onthe docks at Ostend and Havre, and bursts followed by fires were seen at variouspoint in the dock areas.49. Two Havocs of Fighter Command scored hits on the aerodromes atBeauvais and Evreux, and a Beaufort of Coastal Command hit a factory nearNantes.
Coastal Operations.50. Coastal Command flew 223 patrols (302 sorties) and provided 31 convoy escorts (100 additional sorties). Snipping protection patrols carried out by fighter Command totalled 370 (778 sorties).51. Aircraft of Bomber, Fighter and Coastal Commands continued their attacks on enemy shipping. Fifteen Blenheims of Bomber Command, escorted by fighters, made a particularly successful attack on two convoys off the Dutch Coast.Attacking at mast height in&apos;face of heavy A.A. fire and through a ship-borneballoon barrage, they set fire to five merchant vessels of a total tonnage of 27,000.Hits were also obtained on a tanker of about 3,000 tons. Other Blenheims ofthe same Command sank a 5,000 ton merchant vessel off the Belgian Coast and oneof 1,200 tons off Ijmuiden, and scored four hits on another of 650 tons west of st. Nazaire.52. Hurricanes of Fighter Command sank two flak ships and two mine-sweepers off Ostend, and severely damaged three minesweepers, a flak ship, atrawler and a 1,000 ton ship of the corvette type off the French and Belgiancoasts.53. A Hudson and a Beaufort of Coastal Command scored hits on two merchant vessels of 6,000 tons and 5,000 tons respectively off the Alsboen Light.54. The offensive activity of the German Air Force continued to be directedchiefly against shipping. Six shipping attacks were made during the week, twoby day, one off Harwich and one in the Atlantic, and four by night, three off SpurnPoint and one off Scarborough. Eriemy minelaying was probably carried out on three nights, in the Bristol Channel, the Thames Estuary and the Humber.United  Kingdom.55. Fighter Command flew, in all their operations, a total of 2,265 sortiesby day and 177 sorties by night; the latter total includes dusk and dawnoperations.56. Enemy day activity over this country has been on a negligible scale. at night only on two occasions have attacks been made on our cities. Southamptonwas the centre of a very scattered attack, and Margate was subjected to a briefattack, possibly by Ju. 87 dive-bombers. If these aircraft were responsible forthis attack, which seems likely from the pattern of the bombing, it is a new development in the use of the stuka aircraft on the Western Front.Central Mediterranean.57. Reconnaissance aircraft from Malta continued to search for enemy shipping convoys; these were subsequently attacked on every possible occasionby Naval and Royal Air Force aircraft, with the following results : Laden SchoonerLaden Schooner&apos;24,000 ton LinerDestroyerMerchant Vessel(8,000 tons)Merchant Vessel(3,000 tons)Merchant Vessel(8,000 tons)Merchant Vessel(small)Near ZuaraNear ZuaraTripoli (L) and lateroff KerkennahIsland.Near Tripoli (L)  ...Tripoli (L).....Off Kerkennah Is-landNorth of KerkennahIslandNorth of KerkennahIslandExplosionattackingTotal loss.Blew up.destroyedBlenheimHit repeatedly by Blen-heirns.

58. On five nights Wellingtons made 33 sorties against Tripoli (L) and dropped a total of over 50 tons of bombs. These attacks were principally directed against the harbour, and, in addition to a number of hits which were made onthe Spanish and Karamanli Moles, many bombs were seen to fall on shippinglying alongside. The barracks and buildings near the W.T. station also were successfully bombed.59. Two Blenheims made a good daylight attack on heavy M.T. and petroltankers on the Misurata-Sirte Road, resulting in considerable confusion, and thedestruction of one petrol tanker and serious damage to 30 other vehicles; oneBlenheim is missing. Another attack by 11 Blenheims was made on the barracksat Horns (L) and Misurata; the barracks were seriously damaged and hits were also made on M.T. dumps and petrol lorries, and troops were sprayed with machine-gun fire with good effect; two of our aircraft collided over the targetand a third crashed.60. Enemy bombing activity has been on an extremely small scale. Theonly attack on Malta was on the night of the 19th/20th September, when one outof six aircraft penetrated over the Island and dropped some incendiaries which did no damage.For fully three months it has not been possible for the Germans to allocateadequate aircraft for the protection of the important supply route betweenTripoli and Sicily or for attacks on Malta. A long-range bomber reserve trainingunit has been employed on operational duties, exemplifying the difficulties experienced by the German Air Force in discharging its commitments in this area.Egypt and Libya.61. Six attacks were made on Benghazi Harbour by approximately fiveWellingtons each night. Hits were made on the Central and Cathedral Molesand on ships at the Italian Mole. One vessel moored at the Outer Mole explodedas a result of an attack, and debris was thrown over a wide area.62. In daylight a total of 39 mary lands attacked supply dumps near Bardiaand Gambut and many direct hits were observed; they also bombed a petroldump south of Gambut.63. Our aircraft made widespread reconnaissances over Cyrenaica, andalso over the Dodecanese Islands and between Greece, Crete and Libya. Fightersmaintained protective patrols over Tobruk and shipping, and carried out offensive patrols over the frontier area.64. There was a marked reduction in enemy operations as compared withthe previous week. Suez and Port Said were attacked at night with bombs andmines by about eight aircraft and some slight civilian damage resulted. Thesituation at Tobruk has been much quieter; single aircraft have attacked during daylight, but with little effect. One early morning attack was carried out by13 aircraft and mines were dropped in the harbour.Russia.British Air Operations.65. Weather conditions have been generally unfavourable. One patrol of eight Hurricanes destroyed four Me. 109s without loss to themselves.Russian Air Operations.66.   There is no information of Russian air operations.German Air Operations.67. Unfavourable weather conditions in the Northern Sector have hamperedair operations against Leningrad, where the situation appears recently to have changed very little. It is reported that German Air Force long-range bombers and fighters were making extensive use of aerodromes in south Finland earlier in the month for operations against Russian batteries between Luga andKronstadt, the Karelian Isthmus, and shipping and naval forces in the Gulf
of Finland. Light bombs are said to have been used against shipping,presumably with the object of disabling rather than sinking vessels likely to beof military value.68. The German Air Force has been extensively employed in co-operationwith the ground forces engaged in the encirclement of Kiev. Close support unitsconsisting of dive-bombers and fighters have been intensively engaged in this area, the long-range bombers operating mainly by day against targets further tothe rear.69. In the Black Sea area operations have been chiefly confined to attacks on shipping and naval forces at Odessa and Sebastopol.Air Intelligence.Finland.70. The Finnish Parliament has passed a law providing that enemyparachutists shall receive the same punishment as spies.Italian A ir Force in Libya.7-1. In last week&apos;s Resume (paragraph 63) a number of Italian Ju. 87s were reported to have crashed in our forward area. It appears that the squadron tookoff for an offensive operation and, presumably owing to faulty navigation, ranout of petrol and force-landed in our territory. At least eight of the aircraft have been reported.as destroyed, and from the Italians&apos; point of view it seems likely that practically the entire squadron and its crews will have to be written off.72. This will cause the Italians serious embarrassment since the number ofJu. 87s in the Italian Air Force, and of crews accustomed to their use, is notlarge. It is thought that the Italians had only three dive-bomber squadrons in Libya.Spain.73. On the 15th June a damaged Focke-Wulf landed in Spain after an engagement with one of our convoys, in which the pilot had been killed.
