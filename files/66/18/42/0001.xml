I also submit, separately, arguments in respectof similar action against Hungary and Roumania, which countries are invadingRussian territory to a greater extent than the Finns.2. It is very doubtful whether a declaration of war or the threat of suchagainst any one or all the three Governments would influence their action. Wehave already taken all the practical measures that are taken on a declaration ofwar save the internment here of Finns, Hungarians and Roumanians.FINLAND.3. The question of declaring war on Finland arises from the Russian appealto us to do anything we can to influence Finland to cease hostilities. In default ofother possible measures to this end, the Prime Minister responded in his recentmessage to Stalin : &quot; We are willing to put any pressure upon Finland in our power, including immediate intimation that we will declare war upon them ifthey continue beyond the old frontiers.&quot; The Finns, according to our reports,continue to advance to some depth in certain places beyond their pre-1940frontiers. We have had many reports of war-weariness and disillusionmentamong the Finns, but also a report that the mood has changed again with thefall of Viborg and the recent successful advances.4. Sir S. Cripps, reporting on his interview with Stalin after the delivery of the Prime Minister&apos;s message, said that Stalin would, of course, like us to declare war on Finland at once. I do not think that a threat of a declaration ofwar would influence the Finns nor, I fear, would such action do so. It is evenconceivable that it might work in the opposite direction by making the Finnsfeel that, the breach with us being complete, there was nothing left to them butto plan their future as a vassal of Germany. It is to the Left elements in Finlandthat we must look. There is nothing to be hoped of Field-Marshal Mannerheim.A declaration of War by us will not strengthen the position of our. friends in finland.11485   [22911]Copy No.
5. Furthermore, a declaration of war would create for us certain shipping difficulties, which would not be grave, but would be distinctly awkward. Theymay be summarised by saying that (a) We should forfeit our chances of getting twenty-eight good ships for -ourselves for the North Atlantic (at present we are planning for themto be taken over by the Swedes, who would charter them to us).   If wedeclare war, the most we can expect is that, after long delays, theymay be employed in trade useful to the Americans.(6) We might cause not a little dislocation to United States trade (e.g., inbauxite), for we have been carefully shepherding these shipstemporarily into this trade by arrangement with the United StatesMaritime Commission.(c) We should lose a certain number of good Finnish crews.HUNGARY.6. Relations with Hungary were maintained until the Hungarian attackon Yugoslavia, because, although Hungary was the country most exposed to german pressure, it had shown some powers of resistance and a high degree ofnational unity. In fact, Hungarian behaviour compared favourably with thatof, e.g., Roumania or Bulgaria.7. - The Hungarian attack upon Yugoslavia ranged Hungary more definitelyin the Axis camp, but the Hungarian Government has nevertheless since managed to maintain a higher degree of independence in its internal policy than most otherGovernments in Europe.8..&apos; Hungary therefore remains potentially one of the more stable elements in Central and South-Eastern Europe, and it may well prove useful after the war to find in Budapest a relatively efficient administrative and financial machine whenconditions throughout Europe are likely to be chaotic.9.   The arguments in favour of declaring war on Hungary are : (a) That such a step might please the Yugoslav and Soviet Governments,against whom Hungary has been fighting; and(b) That it would demonstrate to the world that countries which are not with us will be regarded as definitely against us.10. Such a step might also cause pleasure among some Czechoslovaks, butthe Czechoslovak Minister for Foreign Affairs has recently stated that he doesnot despair of reaching a relatively satisfactory settlement with Hungary afterthe war, and showed no desire for His Majesty&apos;s Government to alter their present attitude towards Hungary.11.   The arguments against declaring war on Hungary, which appear to beconclusive, can be summarised as follows : (a) The Hungarian Government and people are genuinely anti-Nazi and forthe most part anti-German. They are certainly not anti-British.Provided they are not penalised excessively at the peace settlement,they would welcome a British victory and release from german domination. A British declaration of war would, however, convincemost Hungarians that their only hope for the future lay in a Germanvictory, with the result that they would co-operate much more whole-heartedly with Germany than they are doing at present;(b) There is no conflict of interests between this country and Hungary, with whom it should be possible to resume relations on a satisfactory basisafter the war;(c) The existence of a stable national State with a running administrative and financial organization should prove useful in the post-war reconstruction;(d) Relations between Poland and Hungary have been particularly close formany centuries. The conversations which have taken place betweenthe Polish and Czechoslovak Governments have contemplated the
inclusion of Hungary into some federal organization in central europe and the use of Polish good offices to remove Hungarian-Czecho-slovak differences. A solution on these lines, which should be satis-factory, would be much hampered by a British declaration of war against Hungary. This would probably also impose an additionalstrain upon our relations with Poland;(e) The Hungarian Government and people have been left in no doubtregarding British disapproval of their recent actions and attitude. a gesture, such as a declaration of war, is not, therefore, necessary tobring home to them that they must expect to bear the consequences oftheir actions;(/) Action on our part ranging European countries more definitely in theGerman camp is likely to facilitate German propaganda regardingthe &apos;fNew Order&quot; in Europe.ROUMANIA.12. Roumania and Hungary should be considered together : if we declared war on one but not the other, we should implicitly favour the Hungarian (orRoumanian) claim to Transylvania (His Majesty&apos;s Government have hithertomerely stated that they do not recognise the Vienna settlement assigning Transyl-vania to Hungary since it was imposed under duress in time of war). The effectof a declaration of war on Roumania but not on Hungary would be disastrous toour cause in Roumania, where the Transylvanian patriots remain our chiefsympathisers.13. We should therefore declare war on both Hungary and Roumania, or onneither.14. There are the following specific arguments against declaring war onRoumania : (a) By declaring war on Roumania we should be more or less committed to drastic treatment of Roumania at the general peace settlement.It has proved impossible to draw up even provisional plans for thefuture settlement of South-Eastern Europe, and it might conceivablysuit our book to reconstitute a large Roumania. It would be easier to do this if we had not in the meantime committed ourselves toregarding Roumania as an enemy.(6) A declaration of war on Roumania would almost certainly be unwelcome to the Yugoslav Government, who entertain feelings of gratitudetowards Roumania owing to the fact that, unlike Hungary and bulgaria, she has not seized portions of Yugoslav territory, but onthe contrary has shown herself helpful in various ways.The Greek Government would probably not welcome the move,since they probably, like the Yugoslav Government, favour there constitution of Roumania after the war as a buffer to Bulgaria and hungary.We can only guess at the probable Turkish reactions, but theyare not likely to regard such a move with favour.(c) If we declared war on Roumania, we should certainly be pressed by theGreek and Yugoslav Governments to declare war on Bulgaria.Bulgaria, is not fighting Russia, and it would not be to our advantage to declare war on her. To do so would be an empty gesture and wouldhave an unfavourable effect on the not inconsiderable anti-Germanelements in Bulgaria. It would, moreover, be necessary to consult theTurkish Government before taking this step, which they wouldprobably urge us strongly not to take.(d) A declaration of war on Roumania would certainly increase the pressure on us from various Roumanians in this country to recognise a &apos;&apos; FreeRoumanian Movement,&quot; which we are unwilling to do because the roumanians available are not sufficiently good material for thispurpose.
(e) It is improbable that a declaration of war would benefit our position in roumania itself. It might, on the contrary, lead to an increase of anti-British feeling, since the impression would be given that we wereactively siding against Roumania with the Russians, whomRoumanians have always regarded as their bitterest enemies.CONCLUSIONS.15. Finland. I recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should neitherthreaten nor actually issue a declaration of war unless the Soviet Governmentpress them very strongly to do so.16. Hungary and Roumania. [a) The arguments against declaring war onthese two countries appear in themselves to be conclusive. I therefore recommendthat, if it is decided to declare war on Finland, we should not follow suit in thecase of Hungary and Roumania, even at the cost of some inconsistency.(b) If, nevertheless, it is considered necessary to declare war, it will be essential not only to declare it on both countries simultaneously, but also to declare war on Bulgaria.A.
