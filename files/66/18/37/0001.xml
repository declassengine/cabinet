naval SITUATION.General Review.1.   Only one merchant ship has been reported sunk.Heavy casualties have been inflicted on enemy shipping by our aircraft and submarines.Home Waters.2. The Twelfth Canadian troop convoy and one of the largest mercantileconvoys to cross the Atlantic, consisting of 83 ships, have both arrived safely inthe United Kingdom.Three captured Norwegian vessels loaded with 8,700 tons of coal and with 65volunteers on board have arrived in Iceland (C).Three of H.M. destroyers have been damaged during the week : the St. Maryswas in collision with a merchant ship in the North-Western Approaches,the Ripley ran ashore off Flamborough Head in a fog and the Wolfhound was damaged by a near miss mine off Sheringham; the latter&apos;s bows broke off and sank but she was towed to harbour.Approximately 17,500 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or seriously damaged during the week by aircraft of the Bomber and Coastal Commands.Northern Waters.3. H.M. Submarine Trident, on the 19th August, damaged a merchant shipby fshell fire south-west of Trondheim, and three days later attacked a convoy inthe North Cape area and sank the German S.S. Ostpreussen (3,030 tons). On the30th she attacked another convoy in this area, and probably sank a 1,500-ton ship and severely damaged one of 3,000 tons. After this attack 56 depth charges were dropped in her vicinity by the escort, but she escaped damage.Mediterranean.4. H.M. Submarines have reported many successes in the central Mediter-ranean and in Greek waters. The Thrasher sank a schooner laden with oil off cape Malea by gunfire, and five days previously she possibly torpedoed a merchant ship to the eastward of Athens. The Rorqual sank a motor vessel (believed about10,000 tons) to the west of Crete on the 28th August. She suffered some damage from collision with a second merchant ship, but returned safely to her base.The Tetrarch possibly torpedoed a merchant ship off Benghazi on the 19thand a few days later sank 2 schooners of a small convoy proceeding close inshorebetween Tripoli and Benghazi. On the 24th the Upholder attacked three 6-in.gun cruisers north of Cape St. Vito (northwest point of Sicily) and possiblyobtained one hit. On the 26th August the Triumph attacked a battleship andtwo cruisers, escorted by destroyers, which were entering the Straits of Messinafrom the north (these were the ships mentioned in paragraph 5 of last week&apos;resume). She reports a possible hit, and a Naval officer who was beingrepatriated to Beirut in a French convoy states that he saw a cruiser of the Polaclass (10,000 tons, eight 8-in. guns) down by the stern, with a list to starboard,being beached at Messina on this day. The Triumph also demolished a railway bridge near Palermo. The Urge damaged a 5,000 ton ship and sank a tankerin a southbound convoy off the west of Sicily on the 26th, and two days later hit and probably sank a liner believed to be of the Duilio class (23,600). The Utmostdamaged a railway bridge on the west coast of the Gulf of Taranto.The s.s. Deucalion (7,518 tons) on arrival at Gibraltar from Malta reportsthat she was twice unsuccessfully attacked on passage by two torpedo bombers,one of which she shot down.A destroyer was sunk off Tripoli on the night of the 3rd/4th and over65,000 tons of enemy shipping have been damaged or destroyed by our aircraft in the Mediterranean.
Other Foreign Stations.5. H.M. Australian Sloop Yarra captured the Italian S.S. Hilda (4,901tons) off Banda Abbas. The Hilda was slightly damaged, but has arrived in harbour.Search has been made for the unknown enemy ship sighted on 21st to the eastward of Bermuda (last week&apos;s Resume, para. 4) but without result.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. Ten attacks on U-boats, seven of which were made by aircraft, have beenreported during the period. These all took place in the Western and North-Western Approaches. In no instance was there any definite evidence of destruction.Enemy Intelligence.U-boats.7. There have been, on the average, thirty-five German U-boats in the north atlantic during the week. They were working in three main groups; the largestin an area to the south-westward of Iceland (C) and the two others about 300miles to the north-westward and to the south-westward of Ireland. In addition,single U-boats have been seen on patrol to the north-west of the Butt of Lewisand the Bloody Foreland. Four or five U-boats are also believed to be in the atlantic south of the latitude of the Canary Islands.There has been no evidence of Italian U-boats in the past week.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.8. A ship proceeding independently was sunk by U-boat 400 miles west ofIreland : she had been attacked a,nd slightly damaged by a Focke-Wulf a few hours previously. A tanker was damaged by air attack off Milford Haven and aircraft have also unsuccessfully attacked convoys in the Bristol Channel andoff the Durham coast. A ship was bombed in the Gulf of Suez, but details arenot yet available.Protection of Seaborne Trade.9. During the week ending the 3rd September, 1,034 ships, including 159Allied and 18 neutral, were convoyed. Eight anti-aircraft ships, four armed merchant cruisers, sixty-one destroyers, and ninety-six sloops, corvettes and Fleetminesweepers were employed on convoy duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the30th August totalled 819,275 tons. Oil imports were 218,863 tons, mineral imports were 207,562 tons, of which 105,439 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig ironand iron ore. Wood and wood pulp imports were well above average at 70,683tons and copra and palm oil imports were 33,474 tons and cereals 108,431tons. Other food imports amounted to 109,819 tons, the principal commodities-commodities being, in tons: Refrigerated and tinned meat, bacon and hams,21,497; sugar, 20,495; fruit, 9,251; lard and fats, 8,565; cocoa, 6,805; tea,3,857; evaporated and tinned milk, 3,109; jam and honey^ 2,652; and cheese,908. There were also large consignments of motor lorries, machinery and highexplosives.British Minelaying.10.   There was very little minelaying to report in the past week.   M.T.B.&apos;s jlaid a few mines off the Belgian coast and there has been some aircraft mine-laying in the western Baltic, along the German North Sea coast, and off FrenchBiscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.11. Aircraft minelaying occurred mainly off the East Coast, particularlybetween Flamborough Head and Blyth, but the Bristol Channel was visited on one night by a small number of aircraft.[22891] B
Twenty magnetic and 21 acoustic mines have been destroyed during the week,the majority of them in the Thames Estuary.The corrected mines totals are now : Magnetic, 1,367; acoustic, 969; and contact, 1,024.Foreign Waters.       s12. Mines have been reported in the entrance to the White Sea and a dangerous has been declared there.Of the mines supposed to have been laid by a U-boat off West African ports,four have now been destroyed off Lagos and three off Takoradi.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.13. Traffic along the Bilbao-Bayonne route started on the 20th June, and bythe 30th July over 20,000 tons of ore had been shipped from Spain to France. Bythe 20th August 2 German, 8 Dutch, 4 French and 4 Spanish coasters were being employed on this work, and it is thought that the traffic will probably increase;there is plenty of shipping available for it.Italian.The auxiliary tanker Tarvisio is reported to have sailed from Chanak forthe vEgean, as she would not risk the passage into the Black Sea without a pilot,the services of which were refused her.British Contraband Control.-&apos; 14. During the month of August 13,370 tons of cargo destined for theenemy were seized in prize. The main items were 7,133 tons of foodstuffs andbeverages, almost entirely from Finnish ships, 3,740 tons of hides, skins andleather, all from Dutch ships, and 1,071 tons of base metals taken from Spanishships. Among individual commodities seized were 1,018 tons of pyrites,6,097 tons of sugar, 1,006 tons of wheat.The total seizures since the beginning of the war amount to 799,519 tons.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis Operations against Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.15. Leningrad is seriously threatened by strong German armoured andmotorised forces attacking from the south, and the city is in imminent danger ofencirclement. In the Ukraine a serious position is developing as a result of theGerman advance south-east of Gomel. The rest of the Ukrainian front has remained comparatively quiet during the past week, except for the Dniepro-petrowsk sector where strong German forces are endeavouring to enlarge the bridgehead which they have secured in this area.Finland.16. The 1919 Finnish-Soviet frontier has now been reached all along thefront. There is no information of the operations in the far north. the murmansk-Leningrad railway has not yet been cut.17. During the past week the only advance of note in this sector has beenin the Karelian Isthmus, where Finnish troops have advanced as far as the oldMannerheim Line, which extends from Taipale on Lake Ladoga to Summa,25 miles south-east of Viborg.
18. In the central and south-central sectors it is reported that two german divisions in the Salla area and a third in the area north of Lake Ladoga havebeen withdrawn for training under Finnish instructors, owing to the high rateof casualties due to lack of experience of fighting in wooded country.Estonia.19. Tallinn has been evacuated by Soviet troops and the Germans are nowin control of the whole of Estonia. The islands of Oesel and Dago, situated offthe western Estonian coast and commanding the entrance to the Gulf of Riga, are,however, still held by the Russians.Leningrad Front.20. During the past week operations by strong German armoured andmotorised forces, aimed at encircling Leningrad from the south, have achievedconsiderable success in spite of strong Soviet resistance and of difficult conditionsresulting from heavy rainfall in the area. There are indications that all railway communications between Leningrad and Moscow have now been cut and that theGermans are approaching the River Neva, 20 miles east of Leningrad.21. Farther to the south, in the region of Lake Ilmen, German infantry divisions are operating approximately along the line of the River Lovat which runs due north from Kholm. No progress has been reported from this sector andthe German News Agency admits that rain is severely impeding the advance.Central Front.22. This section has been very quiet and there has been no attempt by theGermans to continue their advance on Moscow. North-east of Smolensk there hasbeen a successful local Russian counter-attack. The situation has not, however,materially altered.Ukraine.23. The south-easterly thrust from the southern flank of the Smolensk salientcontinues to make progress and. the Germans have succeeded in cutting rail communications between Bryansk and Kiev. The threat to envelop Kiev andto outflank all the Russian defences on the line of the River Dnieper below thattown has therefore been intensified.24. Secondly, the Germans have obtained a bridgehead over the RiverDnieper at Dniepropetrowsk and have succeeded in widening this bridgeheaddespite fierce Russian resistance. German efforts to obtain other bridgeheadssouth of Dniepropetrowsk have so far failed. Odessa is still in Russian hands and continues to resist stubbornly.Operations.Persia.25. The advance continued in the Khanaqin area during 26th Augustagainst some opposition, whilst our forces in the South were engaged in moppingup operations and reconnoitring the Persian position South of Ahwaz. On the27th one of our columns from Khanaqin occupied Shahabad (60 miles inside thePersian frontier). Another column advanced through the Pai-Tak Pass and occupied Karind.26. On the 28th August the advance continued. Ahwaz in the South andZibri (25 miles West of Kermanshah) were both captured. Later a Persianenvoy informed our Commander that all resistance had ceased.27. Contact was made with advance elements of the Russian forces at Sennaon 31st August and in the area of the Aveh Pass on 1st September.28. In less than three days our forces operating from Khanaqin had advanced about 100 miles through difficult country. The infantry engaged were entirely Indian, to whom great credit is due.   Our casualties were not severe.[22891] b 2
29. The inhabitants are friendly everywhere and our forces are now engaged in minor operations against independent bands of armed soldiers andin restoring order generally.Intelligence.Finland.30. The majority of the Finnish people would undoubtedly welcome peace on the basis of the restoration of the former frontier, provided they were satisfiedthat that line would be permanent.31. The Finns have sustained severe losses both in this and the previous warwith the U.S.S.R., and are now faced with the choice of continuing the strugglefor the expansion of their territories at the risk of being involved in the defeat of Germany; or of making peace with the U.S.S.R. which would ensure a fairsettlement in the event of an Allied victory.Turkey.32. Rumours regarding German troop movements into Bulgaria, whichcontinue to persist, may possibly be a means of maintaining pressure on Turkey.It is thought that at the most&apos;the number of German divisions in the countryis two.Syria.33. The embarkation of the Vichy troops who elected to be repatriatedshould now have been completed, as the last convoy was due to sail on 29thAugust.  The total number of these troops is about 12,900.AIR SITUATION.General Review.34. Attacks on Germany and Occupied Territory were on a heavier scale than in the previous week, and were directed mainly on industrial targets, railway centres and docks.Many successful attacks were made on enemy shipping in Home Waters andin the Mediterranean.Enemy activity over this country remained at a low level.35. For the last three months our bombing offensive has been mainly directed against transportation and morale in Western Germany. Some of the mostimportant objectives in the system of communications serving the Ruhr andRhineland are precision targets which can only be attacked under favourable weather conditions on moonlight nights, and, since the offensive started, thenumber of suitable nights has been very small indeed. On dark nights, and in comparatively unfavourable weather, our aircraft have attacked other transporta-tion objectives in key towns on the system of communications. No spectacularsuccess has been recorded, and few can be expected, since the disruptionof communications can only be achieved by the cumulative effect of attacksdelivered over a considerable period. Moreover, it is often difficult to observe the results of attacks and to assess their effect, and damage to communications iseasy to conceal. However, in spite of the comparatively short time covered bythe present offensive, and the unusually unfavourable weather encountered,reliable reports are now coming in, in increasing numbers, to show that theeffect of our attacks is being felt.36. Concurrently, the attack of targets likely to influence the Battle of the atlantic is undertaken when necessary and attacks on other objectives inGermany are carried out as tactical and other considerations dictate. Acomplement to our offensive against land communications is provided by attacks on ports and by those of our light bombers on shipping; the considerable measureof success achieved has undoubtedly increased the pressure on German&apos;s inlandcommunication system, and so enhanced the value of our main offensive. a valuable factor in the dislocation of communications in Germany is the inter-ference with supplies for the Eastern Front, and our offensive is, therefore, animportant contribution to Russian resistance.
37. Our daylight attacks on industrial objectives in France and dailyfighter sweeps over French territory have been undertaken with the dual objectof reducing the number of enemy fighter units available to reinforce the russian front, and of reducing the output of French industries working for the enemy.Our daylight offensive has undoubtedly succeeded in containing considerableGerman fighter forces in France, and there is evidence that the effect of the attacks on French industries is by no means negligible and may have an important influence on French industrial &quot; collaboration.&quot;38. The principal aim of our air operations in the Central mediterranean and Middle East has been the reduction of the rate of supply to Cyrenaica,combined with the interference of traffic from the Black Sea to the central mediterranean. The attacks maintained from Malta on shipping in the central mediterranean and on Tripoli, and from Egypt on Benghazi and the CorinthCanal, have achieved considerable success in the pursuit of this policy.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.39. Bomber Command despatched 103 sorties, compared with 110 last week,and dropped 28 tons of FEE. bombs and a few incendiaries by day. fighter command flew 1,134 aircraft sorties in the course of offensive operations over-Northern France and the Netherlands and against shipping.40. Seventeen Blenheims, escorted by fighters, made a low-level attack onRotterdam Docks, and, in spite of heavy A.A. fire, hit two merchant vessels of10,000 and 8,000 tons respectively and dockside warehouses. Bombs were alsodropped on other merchant vessels and on ships under construction, but results were not observed.41. Industrial targets in Lille were attacked by 11 Blenheims and bombs were seen to hit several factories, including a large chemical works. a particularly successful attack was made by a force of six Blenheims on the shipyards at Le Trait; many bombs being seen to burst on workshops, and on ships and submarines on the slipways. Bremen was attacked on two occasionsby a Fortress Bomber and five 1,100-lb. bombs are reported to have burst inthe town. Among other targets attacked were railway communications nearDunkirk and St. Omer and the aerodrome at Lannion in Britanny.42. Aircraft of Fighter Command, in addition to. providing escorts forbombers, carried out a number of offensive sweeps over enemy territory, involving87 squadron sorties. During these operations, 13 enemy fighters were destroyed,6 probably destroyed and 14 damaged. We lost 18 fighters but one pilot wasrescued. (These casualties include those incurred during attacks on shipping, seeCoastal Operations.)Night.43. Bomber Command despatched 894 sorties compared with 554 in theprevious week. Operations were restricted on three nights of the week byunfavourable weather. The main objectives were again industrial and railway centres in Germany, and docks and harbours in Belgium and Northern France.The total of 914 tons of FEE. bombs and 95,000 incendiaries released is aconsiderable increase on that of the previous week.44. On Frankfurt and Cologne, which were attacked on two nights, a totalof 320 tons of H.E. bombs and 35,000 incendiaries was released. At Frankfurt,many bursts were seen in an d around the industrial and railway centres and near the inland docks. Cloud and haze over Cologne made observation of resultsdifficult, but bursts were seen near two of the principal railway centres and on the inland docks. Duisburg also received a heavy weight of attack, over 134 tonsof bombs being dropped. Several hits were scored on the railway station, and large explosions were seen on both banks of the river.45. Nearly fifty tons of H.E. bombs and 1,850 incendiaries were dropped on Berlin.  The objectives in the city were clearly identified, and bursts followed
by fires were seen at various points within a radius of one mile of theAlexander Platz. Attacks on a lighter scale were made on Mannheim and Essen,but bad weather precluded observation of results.46. Successful attacks were made on docks in occupied territory. Over85 tons of H.E. bombs were dropped on the docks at Brest, in which the battle cruisers Scliarnhorst and Gneisenau are lying. Although a smoke screen covered the targets it is estimated that bombs burst in the area. At Ostend, Dunkirk,Boulogne, Havre and Cherbourg, fires were started in dock areas.47. Havoc and Blenheim aircraft attacked aerodromes in Northern Franceand in Holland.United Kingdom.48. Fighter Command flew a total of 2,453 sorties (676 patrols) by day and622 sorties (397 patrols) by night; the latter totals include dusk and dawnoperations. Cross-channel offensive operations and shipping patrols again account for the bulk of our effort.49. German Air Force activity has continued on the same small scale as inrecent weeks. By day only five aircraft crossed our coast, three being fighterson an offensive sweep over Kent. At night, attacks were made on two east coast towns but not on a heavy scale. Twin-engined night fighters operated in the usual areas, and shot down one of our returning bombers. they also bombed a number of aerodromes but without causing serious damage orcasualties. Four enemy aircraft were destroyed at night during the week, threeby fighters and the fourth by the Humber balloon barrage.Coastal Operation.50. Coastal Command flew 209 patrols (397 sorties) and provided escortsfor 46 convoys (231 additional sorties). Shipping-protection patrols carried outby Fighter Command totalled 545 (1,128 sorties).51. Aircraft of Bomber, Fighter and Coastal Commands continued theirsuccessful attacks on enemy shipping. Three Blenheims, escorted by fighters,made a low-level attack on a 4,000-ton merchant vessel off Dunkirk. The vessel,which was closely protected by six flak ships and four &quot; E &quot;-boats, was hit three times and left in flames and enveloped in smoke, while some of the escortingvessels were set on fire by our fighters. Off Stavanger, three Beauforts attackedtwo merchant vessels of 7,000 and 2,500 tons respectively and an escort vessel.The larger merchant vessel was hit by two torpedoes and was soon ablaze, andthe escort vessel was hit on the stern. A Hudson on patrol off the norwegian coast scored a direct hit on a 3,000-ton merchant vessel off Kristiansand.52. Ten Spitfires of Fighter Command attacked a 5,000-ton merchant vesselescorted by two destroyers and two flak ships off Barfleur. In spite of intenseA.A. fire, both flak ships were set on fire and the merchant vessel was hit. other vessels attacked by Spitfires include an &quot; R &quot;-boat, which was left in a sinkingcondition off Dunkirk, a large minesweeper entering Dieppe Harbour, which was hit several times, and a 1,000-ton cargo vessel off Alderney, on the bridge of whichseveral explosions were seen.53. Forty-four aircraft laid mines off Brest, La Pallice and Kiel, and off the danish and Norwegian Coasts.54. Minelaying by enemy aircraft was on a small scale. Only three attacks were made by enemy aircraft on shipping off our coasts during the week.Central Mediterranean.55. A series of successful attacks were made by Blenheims, Wellingtons and naval Swordfish aircraft operating from Malta against enemy shipping on passage to the African Coast and in harbour in Sicily and Tripoli (L).   In addition to a
destroyer which was torpedoed and sunk, the following merchant ships were sunk or seriously damaged :  5,000 tons ... Bombed, blew up.8,000 ,, ... Bombed.  On fire from stern to funnel.5,000 ,, ... Bombed.   On fire.1,200 ,, ... Torpedoed.  Left stationary and with a heavy list.Unknown ... Bombed.   On fire.Medium ... Bombed.   Believed sunk.Medium ... Bombed.   Blazing from stem to stern.3/5,000 tons ... Bombed.   Left well alight.8/9,000 ... Torpedoed.   Blew up.9,000 ,, ... Torpedoed amidships.9,000 ,, ... Torpedoed.   Seriously damaged.9,000 ,, ... Torpedoed.   Seriously damaged.8,000 ,, ... Probable hit with torpedo.8/10,000  ,, ... Hit by bomb.56. During the week a total of 40 Wellingtons were despatched againstTripoli (L), and at least six ships in the harbour were hit and a petrol dumpexploded, while extensive fires were caused on the unloading quays and M.T.dispersal areas. Subsequent daylight reconnaissance showed that ships and stores were still burning. On the night of the 1st/2nd September the power station was attacked, two sticks of bombs falling across the target, and many others in the vicinity.57. A night attack by Swordfish on a convoy off Cape Spartivento achievedcomplete surprise and resulted in at least four ships being hit. Such confusionresulted that the escorting destroyers fired on their own ships and several shipsnarrowly escaped collision.58. Hurricanes and Blenheims made daylight attacks on targets in Italyand Sicily. The power houses of two munition factories at Licata, Sicily, were hit by six bombs, and at Crotone, Italy, large explosions and fires followed hitson buildings in a munition factory, which subsequent photographs show to havebeen severely damaged. In addition, a ship in harbour was hit three times, and ground targets were machine-gunned. During a night attack on two Sicilianaerodromes naval Swordfish shot clown an Italian bomber in flames.59. A few high-flying enemy aircraft crossed the coast of Malta by day,and there were two ineffective night attacks by about six aircraft.Egypt and Cyrenaica.60. Benghazi harbour was attacked on three nights by a total of twenty-one aircraft. During these attacks one ship is believed to have been hit, and othernear misses were reported. Night attacks were also made on Derna, where officers&apos;quarters were hit, and on a stores dump at Gambut, where many fires broke out.Landing grounds at Berca and Gazala were bombed and machine-gunned. by day, an attack was made on a stores dump near Bardia by nine mary lands.Reconnaissance flights and shipping protection patrols were also flown.61. Tobruk was twice attacked by a force of about 40 bombers with fighter escort. On the first occasion the harbour was the objective, and on the secondA.A. sites and a gun position appeared to be the target. A few vehicles and asmall quantity of ammunition were destroyed. The bombing was, however,notably inaccurate, and some bombs even fell in the Italian lines. In the courseof these attacks two bombers were destroyed and six probably destroyed. several other attacks were made on Tobruk, but were even less effective. daylight attacks were also made on Mersa Matruh and on Jarabub, where the Senussimosque was slightly damaged. An attack by enemy fighters on our forwardlanding grounds was intercepted by fighters of the South African Air Force, whoshot down five of the enemy without loss to themselves.62. Both Port Said and Alexandria have suffered night attacks. . Threenight raids were made on Port Said by a total of about 30 aircraft. A quaywas hit and a warehouse set on fire, but with these exceptions the attacks were
ineffective. At Alexandria some damage was done to workshops and civilianproperty, and there were a few service casualties. The aerodrome at Abu Sueirwas also attacked by about 12 aircraft, but little damage resulted.Greece and the iEgean.63. Following an extensive reconnaissance which disclosed the presence of thirty aircraft, including a number of four-engined types, 26 Wellingtonsattacked the aerodromes at Eleusis and Menidi. At the former, five hangars were hit, two of which caught fire, and many dispersed aircraft are believed to havebeen burnt out. At Menidi several hangars were destroyed, and fires were started in adjacent woods, believed to contain stores and equipment. Two aircraft also bombed Heraklion aerodrome, Crete.64. Sixteen Wellingtons attacked aerodromes in Rhodes, dropping 18 tonsof H.E. among hangars and dispersed aircraft. At Maritza there were twoexplosions and five fires broke out in the dispersal area.East Africa.65.   Air operations in support of the military campaign have continued.Russia.66. Over the greater part of the front there has been little change in thesituation except in the Leningrad area. The fall of Tallinn and the elimination of Russian resistance in Northern Estonia must seriously jeopardise the russian air Force bases in the Island of Oesel, at the mouth of the Gulf of Riga, whichare now within easy range of German fighter and bomber attacks. The continuedadvance on Leningrad has exposed the defences of the city and the remainingcommunications to the east and south-east to heavy air attack.67. Enemy reconnaissance and anti-shipping patrols have been carried out over the Black Sea and Crimea with the object of cutting off supplies and rein-forcements for the garrison at Odessa. Both the Russian and German Air forces have been engaged in fierce fighting over bridgeheads across the Dnieper fromDnepropetrovsk to the sea, and Italian and Roumanian units have co-operated with the German Air Force in this sector.68. The efficiency of German Air Force units in all sectors remains good andindicates that fuel supplies and field maintenance difficulties have been overcome,thus enabling an intensive effort to be maintained after two and a half months of heavy fighting.Loss of Leading German Fighter Commanders in Russia.69. At least three of the best known and most capable Gruppe Komman-deurs of the German fighter force have recently been lost, including HauptmannJoppien, a Gruppe Kommandeur of the Moelders Geschwader (J.G.51). TheGerman communique of the 29th August reported him missing and assumed lostafter his seventieth victory.HOME SECURITY.General.By Day.70.   No bombs have been dropped on land in daylight during the week.By Night.71.   Bombing was not on a heavy scale.   On three nights of the week some -serious damage and casualties were caused.  The remaining four nights.passed offwith only minor bombing in East Anglia and along the east and north-east coasts.72. On the 31st August/1st September there was a sharp attack upon Hull,where 41 people were killed, mostly as the result of a direct hit on a communalshelter.  Six domestic shelters were also hit.
73. On the 1st/2nd September Newcastle was attacked and several fires were started; 42 people were killed. Bombs were also dropped at Blaydon,Gateshead, Tynemouth, Dudley, Wallsend and other places in the neighbourhood.Six R.A.F. stations were bombed without serious effect.Damage.74. On the 1st/2nd September at Newcastle over 100 houses were demolished.The New Bridge Street goods station was burnt out, when about 1,500 tons of flour, 160 tons of sugar and 20 tons of bacon were destroyed. The L.N.E.R.station at Jesmond was blocked by debris and Manors Railway Station was hit.Donald Brown and Co.&apos;s iron works at Blaydon were reported to be demolished and British Ropes Ltd. factory at Gateshead and Hawthorn Leslie&apos;s St. Peter&apos;sworks at Newcastle were damaged.75. On the 2nd/3rd September four H.E. bombs fell on the premises ofImperial Chemical Industries at Billingham-on-Tees and the research depart-ment workshop of the Fertilizer and Synthetic Products factory was considerablydamaged.Casualties.76. The casualties for the week ending 0600 on the 3rd September are estimated at 116 killed and 144 seriously injured. There were no casualties inLondon.[22891]c
