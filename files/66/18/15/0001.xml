THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT -Printed for the War Cabinet.   August 1941.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (41) 192.August 15, 1941.WAR CABINET.CONTROL OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND BORDER.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I THINK the War Cabinet ought to be aware of the facts and considerationsrelating to the control of the border between Northern Ireland and Eire, and i submit this memorandum for information :  1. The land frontier is about 180 miles long and has been drawn withoutany regard to strategical considerations or the question of the control of traffic.It is crossed by a large number of roads, and in some places it goes through farmsand villages, so that persons resident near the border cross it in the course oftheir work, for purposes of shopping, and so on. The close business and socialrelations and family connection between people living in Northern Ireland and people living in Eire results in substantial traffic across the border by footpassengers, vehicular traffic and the railways. There is no possibility of puttinga completely effective control on the border by means of any physical obstaclesor by closely spaced patrols.2. Under Customs Regulations, merchandise may cross the border only byapproved roads during specified hours or by rail. Persons not carryingmerchandise and farmers carrying their own produce ss the border atany point and at any time. There are 16 approved roads and 10 railway crossings.The term &quot; approved roads&quot; are roads approved for the carriage of merchandise.There are customs posts on each side of the border. The specified hours formerchandise traffic by these roads are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on ordinary week-days, during which hours customs officers are in attendance at the posts. to deter smuggling by unapproved routes and also by approved roads outside thehours of customs attendance and on Sundays and public holidays, the customsrely on 100 or so R.U.C. officers who patrol the border. There are censorshipofficers at the more important customs posts and railway crossings while customsofficers are in attendance.3. By an order of the Northern Ireland Government under their own special powers Act it is provided that every person who had entered Northern Irelandafter the 15th July shall, if so required by a Police Officer, satisfy the police authorities that his presence in Northern Ireland is not for any purpose detri-mental for the preservation of peace and maintenance of order, and that every person of 14 years of age and upwards must have in his possession an approveddocument of identity. As regards these documents of identity, there are frequentchecks on passengers en trains crossing the border and occasional checks onpersons entering by road.4. All telegrams and nearly 10 per cent, of the letters passing between northern Ireland and Eire are secretly examined and between 15 and 20 per cent,of the cross telephone calls are monitored. The letters selected for examinationdo not include those passing to and from respectable and known persons or firms and probably as many as 50 per cent, of letters liable to contain suspicious matter[22807]
are examined. Complete arrangements are in force for controlling all forms ofcommunication between Great Britain and Ireland, including Northern Ireland,but it has been thought useless to expand the open censorship arrangements onmails between Northern Ireland and Eire, seeing that (a) the present arrange-ments give a good cross check of the traffic, and so far no evidence has beenobtained that this means of communication is being used for passing informationof importance, and (b) that an expansion of the censorsjiip staff for the purposeof imposing a more complete check would be a waste of man power if anybodycan cross the border carrying a letter in his pocket. Moreover, Postal and Tele-graph Censorship have taken the view, endorsed by the Home Defence (Security)Executive, that the imposition of a censorship without a complete and effective control of the frontier to stop all illicit communication might be an actual source of danger.5. It is obvious that these arrangements, and particularly the existence ofthe secret censorship, make it easy for uninformed critics to say that there is nothing to prevent ill-disposed persons coming into Northern Ireland from Eire,collecting information of use to the enemy and taking it back to the GermanEmbassy in Dublin, and there is nothing to prevent ill-disposed persons resident in Northern Ireland from carrying such information to Dublin. In fact, however,the Service representatives and representatives of the Security and CensorshipDepartments think that the dangers are more apparent than real. Little, if any,information of value can be picked up by casual observers. The Royal ulster constabulary have a very good knowledge of the dangerous individuals inNorthern Ireland, and the Inspector-General is of the opinion that his men are much better employed in keeping a watch on all suspicious characters who maylive in or may enter a particular district than in attempting to control trafficacross the border. This view is supported by the general experience of the security service, which shows that the concentration of special measures at particular points directed by intelligence information is far more effective than generalmeasures of a more or less mechanical nature such as would be involved in any system of control on border traffic. Moreover, the Inspector-General of the royal ulster Constabulary believes that the police and secret service of Eire is good and that, in fact, he would get adequate information about espionage activitiesby persons trying to enter Northern Ireland from Eire.6. The Home Defence (Security) Executive have been concentrating their attention on the question of what types of information it is particularly desirableto keep secret and what measures are necessary for this purpose. One of the steps taken has been to devise methods of cutting off private telephone communi-cation between Northern Ireland and Eire during an air raid. There are alsospecial measures to safeguard special service operations.7. At the time of my visit to Northern Ireland there was discussion with northern Ireland Ministers and officials on the question whether there would be advantages in instituting a system by which persons who are not resident inNorthern Ireland should be required to obtain a permit for entry into NorthernIreland and persons resident in Northern Ireland should be required to obtain a permit for leaving Northern Ireland via the border. It was recognised thatsuch a scheme would only be partially effective, since it would still be possiblefor persons to cross the border surreptitiously without permits, but it wassuggested that, if such persons were liable to prosecution for an offence, a permitscheme would at any rate act as a deterrent and make unauthorised crossings ofthe border more difficult.8. After my return to London there was a preliminary discussion of thisscheme at the Home Defence (Security) Executive. It appeared that similarproposals had been previously explored and that in view of the Home Defence.(Security) Executive there are objections to such a scheme (a) because it wouldnot prevent really dangerous persons from crossing surreptitiously; (b) because itwould require a large expenditure of man-power and a diversion of trained officers from more useful to less useful work; and (c) because it would create a falseimpression of security. The Home Defence (Security) Executive, however,decided to consider the matter further on the receipt of detailed proposals from northern Ireland.
9. I have now received from Northern Ireland a letter which makes it clearthat the Northern Ireland Ministers, on further examination of the problem, have come to the conclusion that such a permit scheme cannot be recommended.In view, therefore, of the fact that the experts on the Home Defence(Security) Executive, representing the Service Departments, the CensorshipDepartment and the Security Service, do not support a permit scheme and thatthe Northern Ireland Ministers do not now ask for it, I feel that such a suggestionmust be abandoned.10. It has been suggested by the Northern Ireland Government that theexisting control, which is entirely a customs control, should be reinforced for security purposes, and I propose to discuss this matter with the Departmentsconcerned. The Northern Ireland Ministry also ask that the military should be requested to co-operate by the provision of mobile patrols along the border and saythat the General Officer Commanding would be prepared to consider the provisionof such assistance as part of their training programme, on the understanding thatthese patrols would be liable to be withdrawn in the event of a serious emergencyarising.11. The Northern Ireland Government would also like an open censorshipenforced on letters between Northern Ireland and Eire similar to the censorshipon letters between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is obviously difficult for them to explain to their supporters why there should be a full censorship onletters between Belfast and Liverpool but no similar censorship on letters betweenBelfast and Dublin. The reasons, however, against increasing the censorshipstaff for this purpose are strong see paragraph 4 above and there is the furtherconsideration that the imposition of censorship between Northern Ireland and Eiremight well lead to a move on the part of Northern Ireland for the withdrawal ofthe censorship between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This would meanexchanging the substance for the shadow, and would be most strongly opposed by the Home Defence (Security) Executive. In the circumstances, I do not feel able to support their request.H. M.Home Office, August 15, 1941.
