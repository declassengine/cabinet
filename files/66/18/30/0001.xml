aNAYAL SITUATION.General Review.Shipping losses have been moderate and well below the weekly average for the war.Successful operations have been carried out by H.M. ships in the western mediterranean and the Persian Gulf.The number of attacks on U-Boats by aircraft in the North-western approaches has been exceptionally high.Home Waters.2. The Free French Submarine Rubis torpedoed a Finnish merchant ship off Norway, on the 21st, at close range. The Rubis was damaged by the explosions,and forced to return on the surface escorted by H.M. Ships and our aircraft.H.M.S. Southern Prince (minelayer) was torpedoed 70 miles west of the faroes, but was able to return to port at reduced speed.H.M. net layer Tonbriclge was sunk by bombs off Yarmouth. H.M. SloopBlack Sivan, while escorting a coastal convoy, was damaged by a near miss offMilford Haven, and returned, to port with two unexploded bombs on board; these were successfully removed. The lighthouse at Myggenaes, Faroes, was bombed and the wireless station damaged during the afternoon of the 24th.An enemy aircraft was shot down by H.M. Trawler Brabant off theNorthumbrian coast.Approximately 23,900 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or seriously damaged during the week by aircraft of the Bomber and Coastal Commands.Northern Waters.3.   H.M. Submarine Tigris torpedoed and sank a merchant ship of 3,0000    tons off the Norwegian coast.A laden ammunition ship of 5,000 tons and a 2,000-ton merchant vessel were sunk in Petsaino harbour by a Russian submarine.North Atlantic.4. During the night of the 23rd/24th, H.M. Corvette Zinnia, whileescorting an outward-bound Gibraltar convoy, was torpedoed and sunk to the westward of Oporto. Details of the attack on the convoy are given inParagraph 11.H.M. Canadian Armed Merchant Cruiser Prince David reported on the 21stthat she had sighted and lost touch with an unknown enemy ship, which shebelieved to be a heavy cruiser, 700 miles E.N.E. of Bermuda.Mediterranean.5. The Gibraltar Force, comprising H.M. Ships Nelson, Ark Royal,Hermione, Manxman (minelayer) and five destroyers, carried out operations inthe Western Mediterranean during the week. Early on the 24th aircraft from.M.S. Ark Royal set on fire the cork forests and successfully attacked factories in the neighbourhood of Tempio, Northern Sardinia. During the day submarine and aircraft reports indicated that Italian forces totalling three battleships, sixcruisers and numerous destroyers were at sea between Sardinia and Sicily. the gibraltar Force proceeded to the southward, but was unable to make contact, asair reconnaissance failed to locate the enemy. A report received about nightfallshowed the enemy to be too far to the eastward for air attack, and the GibraltarForce returned to port. A Cant floatplane, which was shadowing on the after-noon of the 24th, was damaged by naval fighters and a Ju. 52 was shot down.Some of the Italian forces were reported on the 26th entering the Straits ofMessina from the northward, and all are believed to have returned to harbour.
H.M. Submarine Torbay has reached Alexandria with 130 British and allied troops on board from Crete. Previous to embarking these troops she sank alarge Italian schooner off Cape Matapan. H.M. Submarine Unbeaten, on the19th, attacked a southbound convoy of four fast liners to the south-west ofMazzara, Sicily, and obtained one hit with a torpedo. On the following day H.M.Submarine Unique, off Tripoli, also attacked four liners escorted by destroyers,and claimed three hits on the Italian S.S. Esperia (11,398 tons). H.M. SubmarineUpholder sank a laden 2,000-ton merchant ship and obtained two torpedo hitson/tfcg&quot; Italian Fleet Oiler jF&amp;rvisio (5,404 tuvxb) off the north-west of Sicily.H.M. Submarines P.32 and P.33 are overdue from patrol, and P-.33 must beconsidered lost.H.M.S. Phoebe was torpedoed by an aircraft north of Bardia on the27th and returned to port at reduced speed. Earlier in the week H.M. DestroyerNizam was bombed and stopped by a near miss when returning to base fromTobruk, but was able to proceed.During the week nine French merchant ships (upwards of 24,400 tons) east-ward and four (17,947 tons) westward have passed Gibraltar under escort.Persian Gulf.6. A military force was landed on the Persian coast from H.M. Ships on the25th August. In the course of the operations, two Persian sloops, Babr andPalang (950 tons, built 1931, three 4-inch) were sunk, and four gunboats, a depotship, two tugs and a floating dock of 6,000 tons capacity were captured. Onemerchant ship was sunk and seven were captured, of which the German Hohenfels(7,862 tons) and the Sturmfels (6,288 tons) were undamaged, and five others,though sabotaged, can be repaired. Admiral Bayender, the Commander-in-Chiefof the naval and military forces in South Persia, was killed. British navalcasualties were one officer and three ratings wounded.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. There were eighteen attacks on U-boats during the week, fourteen by aircraft and four by surface ships. One attack by a destroyer was made west of cape Finisterre and one by aircraft to the westward of Lisbon. All the remaindertook place in the North-Western Approaches between the latitudes of Galwayand the Faroes. One U-boat is believed to have been severely damaged and anattack by H.M. Trawler Vascama appeared promising. Hits were claimedon two other occasions, but there was no definite evidence of destruction.Enemy Intelligence.German.8.   No changes have been reported in the positions of the main German units.Analysis of air photographs shows that there have been considerable delays in building in some shipyards, particularly in the completion of U-boats.Raiders.9. It is estimated that there are four surface raiders at large, one each in the pacific, Indian and South Atlantic Oceans and the fourth in either the North or south Atlantic.U-boats.10. About thirty German U-boats and six or seven Italians have been operat-ing in the Atlantic. Most of the Germans have operated in the area between thenorth-western coast of Ireland (Ft) and the south of Iceland (C). Others were tothe westward of Portugal and two or three are believed to be in the south atlantic.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11.   Shipping casualties so far reported have again been well below theaverage, in spite of attacks on two convoys.  U-boats continued their concentratedattacks on the outward-bound convoy to Gibraltar mentioned in last week&apos;s[22857] B
Resume, and it is estimated that at one time there were as many as nine U-boats in the vicinity. They sank three more ships and a tug, making a total of eightvessels, in addition to the Norwegian Destroyer Bath and ELM. Corvette Zinnia.An outward Atlantic convoy was attacked by U-boats to the westward ofIreland (R) and at least four ships were sunk. One ship, dispersed from an outward convoy, was torpedoed and sunk in the North-Western Approaches. one ship was damaged by a mine off Pantellaria and another was shelled by a U-boaton passage from Malta to Gibraltar. One ship was mined and sunk in the RiverOrwell. A raider sank a Dutch ship off the Galapagos Islands on the 17th andprobably a second vessel two days later.Protection of Seaborne Trade.12. During the week ending the 27th August 1,079 ships, including 214Allied and 32 neutral, were convoyed. Four anti-aircraft ships, nine armed merchant cruisers, sixty destroyers and ninety sloops, corvettes and minesweeperswere employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the 23rd August totalled 1,373,683 tons, compared with 618,817 tons during theprevious week and an average of 892,743 tons during the past 10 weeks. oil imports amounted to 492,902 tons in 45 tankers. Mineral imports were 344,120tons, of which 218,116 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. Woodand pulp imports were 51.121 tons and cereal imports were 216,342 tons, of which11,140 tons were rice. Twenty-six ships were fully laden with grain. other food imports totalled 201,816 tons, the principal commodities being : sugar andmolasses, 88,619 tons; refrigerated and tinned meat, bacon and hams, 38,869 tons;evaporated and tinned milk. 11,016 tons; lard and fats, 9,914 tons; cheese, 6,116tons; dried, tinned and fresh fruit, 8,883 tons. Imports of machinery, aircraft,motor-lorries, ammunition and aircraft were satisfactory.British Minelaying.13. On the 21st August the Free French submarine Rubis laid 18 mines offthe Norwegian coast and on the following day M.T.Bs. laid 8 off the Belgian coast and H.M.S. Agammemnon laid 624 off North Rona. On the 25th August H.M.Ships Southern Prince, Port Quebec and Adventure laid 1,390 in the Iceland (C)-Faroes Channel. There has been considerable minelaying by aircraft off theFrench Biscay ports, the German North Sea coast and in the Western Baltic. Inthe Mediterranean H.M.S. Manxman laid 156 mines on the 24th August.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.14. Minelaying by aircraft was again on a small scale and was carried outonly on alternative nights. On four nights during the week minelaying was suspected off the East coast from the North Foreland to the Firth of Forth andoff Milford Haven.Twenty-one ground mines have been destroyed during the week. The minetotals are : magnetic 1,345, acoustic 949, and contact 1,022.Foreign Waters.Two dangerous areas have been declared and a searched channel established at Bey rout. New searched channels have been established at Rangoon andPenang.Enemy Merchant Shipping.15. Finnish broadcasts have stated that the Finnish Hogland (4,360 tons),with a cargo of iron ore for a German port, was torpedoed and sunk off the coast of Norway on the 17th August.The German Government has offered to sell the Montevideo (6,675 tons) andthe Windhuk (16,662 tons), both imBrazilian ports, to the Brazilian Government.
The Italian Barbarigo (5,295 tons) is reliably reported to have been sunk.The purchase by the Argentine Government of the sixteen Italian ships inArgentine ports was completed on the 25th August.Intelligence.Russia.16. Odessa is being supplied from Sebastopol by about one ship per day.It is reported that minesweepers and other small craft have been collected by theenemy in Bessarabian ports.U.S.A.17. The two German and twenty-seven Italian merchant ships taken overby the United States Government are being transferred to the Panamanian flag,although they will be kept under the control of the Maritime Commission. the thirty-seven Danish ships in the U.S.A. are to be requisitioned by the maritime commission.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is includedin this Resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.18. Outstanding events of the week were an advance by the Finns to withina few miles of Viipuri, a German advance in the Baltic area threatening the moscow-Leningrad railway and Leningrad itself, and a serious drive south-eastwards near Gomel combined with an attempt to outflank Kiev from the northby an advance north-eastward from the Korosten-Kiev railway.Except for Odessa and a few bridgeheads held by Soviet forces west of the dnieper, the area of the Ukraine within the bend of this river, from just belowKiev southwards, is in German hands.Finland.19. The Finns now claim to be holding the eastern bank of the River Vuoksifrom Enso to Kiyinniemi. This implies that the Russians in the east of theIsthmus have retired south of the water defences of the former Mannerheim Line.A big-scale attack on Viipuri has developed from the west and north. TheRiver Vuoksi has been forded at Autrea and Finnish forces claim to be withina few miles of Viipuri.The Baltic Front.20. The German effort during the past week has been concentrated on the drive eastwards north of Lake Ilmen which has resulted in a further advanceeast of the River Luga and the fall of Novgorod. These constitute a very seriousthreat to the Moscow-Leningrad railway and Leningrad itself.South of Lake Ilmen there has been little appreciable change.White Russia.21.   There has been no eastward advance on this front.Ukraine.22. During the past week the most serious development on this front hasbeen the south-easterly advance of strong German armoured and motorised forcesthrough Gomel. This drive is believed already to have penetrated into the extremenorthern districts of the Ukraine.23. Simultaneously with this drive from the north, German forces have advanced north-eastwards north of Kiev, and there are indications that thecrossing of the River Dnieper, near the confluence of the River Pripet, has been effected. Thus, both Kiev itself and the Soviet forces between Gomel and Kievare threatened simultaneously with envelopment from the north and from the
south, and the continued advance from the north would turn the line of the dnieper.24. Operations within the bend of the Dnieper, aimed at eliminating allbridgeheads held by Soviet forces on the right bank, are believed to have beenvery largely successful. At the same time there is no confirmation of the Germanshaving secured bridgeheads on the left bank, though a strong effort is being madeto do so near Dnepropetrovsk, which the Germans claimed on the 2t6h August tohave taken.Odessa remains in Russian hands.Operations.Libya and Egypt.25. During the earlier part of the week patrolling activity in the western desert was curtailed by a heavy sandstorm. The usual minor activity on bothsides, including daily and nightly bombing of Tobruk, has been maintained.A abyssinia.26. A serious explosion took place on the 22nd August in the Naval barracksat Assab, causing the death of four Europeans and wounding several others.There was some suspicion of a delayed-action mine, and a court of enquiry isbeing held.East A frica.27. It has been decided to form a new command in East Africa, to comeinto effect on the 15th September. This command will comprise all territoriessouth .of the Sudan border and north of the Southern Rhodesian border, andwill be commanded by Lieut.-General Sir W. Platt.Persia.28. Successful military operations, combined with a Russian invasion fromthe north, culminated in an order from the Shah that all resistance should cease.29. In the early morning of the 25th August our forces crossed the Persianfrontier.   The attack was carried out by two columns : (a) The Southern Column operating from Basra in co-operation with theRoyal Navy, consisted of : 8 Indian Division.13 D.C.O. Lancers.(&amp;) The Northern Column operating from Khanaquin, consisted of : 9 Armd. Bde.14/20 Hussars.1/5 Gurkha Rifles.2/7 Gurkha Rifles.21 Indian Inf. Bde. (less one bn.) and supporting arms.By the end of the first day the Southern Column had captured the oil refineryat Abadan, which was undamaged, and the town of Khurramshahr. The port ofBandar Shahpur surrendered to two companies of 3/10 Baluch Regt. co-operating with the Royal Navy.One company of 3/10 Baluch Regt. was landed by air in the oilfields area for the protection of British employees.The Northern Column had captured the oilfield at Naft-i-Shah and the town of Qasr-i-Shirin, after meeting some opposition.  Our casualties were not severe.30. By the end of the second day the 24th Indian Infantry Brigade, inthe South, had advanced forty miles towards Ahwaz. In the North, our forces had occupied Gilan (South of the Pai-Tak pass) and were continuing the advance in the direction of Shanabad.
Intelligence.Germany.31. It is believed that there are still 26 German divisions in France and an analysis of the identified divisions has led to the following deductions : 32. This garrison consists of Reserve, Landwehr, Ersatz and Landes-schutzen divisions which are composed generally of elderly reservists, men of lowmedical category and raw recruits. These formations are not of high fighting-value and probably lack modern equipment.It appears, therefore, that the total of 26 divisions includes a considerablenumber which are of value only for internal security purposes, and that the effective field force seems unlikely to exceed 10-15 divisions.33. There are probably now four tank battalions in France, recentlyformed and still completing training; two each in the areas. Bordeaux-Bayonneand Paris; those in the Paris area are certainly equipped with French tanks.Spain.34. The Germans are still improving communications and establishingdumps near the Franco-Spanish frontier. In addition to these long-term pre-reparations, it is reported that the French coast from Biarritz southwards to theSpanish frontier has been declared a forbidden zone and is to be completelyevacuated of its civilian population. The marked increase in heavy coast defenceartillery along that coast revealed by air reconnaissance suggests that this measure may be due to fear of an attempted British landing, rather than an indication of early German action against Spain.Far East.35. The present distribution of Japanese Divisions is believed to be asfollows : Divisions.Manchukuo        ...      ...      ...... 21Korea      ...      ...                                  - - 2Sakhalin   ...      ...      ...      .... 2Japan       ...       ...                                    - - 14N. China  ............      ...... 3C. China.................. 10S. China (Canton Area)............ 2FormosaHainan     ...       ...       .......       ... 2French Indo-China (South)     ...      ...... 2Total       ............      ... 6136. No confirmation has been received that the Japanese troops in SouthernIndo-China exceed the two divisions which it is known have been sent there, andtheir strength is probably approximately 50,000.AIR SITUATION.General Review.37. The results of our night operations against Germany were difficult to observe owing to poor visibility, and there is little of importance to record fromthe Home Front.German activity over this country was again on a small scale.Our aircraft co-operated with other forces in the operations in Persia.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.38. Bomber Command despatched 110 sorties, compared with 157 last week,and dropped 23 tons of H.E. bombs and 86 incendiaries by day. fighter command flew 1,071 aircraft sorties in the course of offensive operations overNorthern France and the Netherlands and against shipping.
Twelve Blenheims, escorted by long-range fighters, successfully attackedIjmuiden Iron and Steel Works; all bombs hit the target and bursts were seen on the rolling mill, warehouse, cooling tower and other buildings.39. An attack by Whirlwind fighters on aerodromes at Maupertus andLannion resulted in the destruction on the ground of 13 enemy bombers. Afurther four bombers were damaged and six fighters, also on the ground, were attacked with cannon fire.40. Aircraft of Fighter Command, in addition to providing escorts, carriedout a number of offensive sweeps over enemy territory, involving a total of89 squadron sorties. In most cases, German fighter formations seemed unwilling to give combat except under very favourable circumstances. On the occasions when combats took place, our fighters destroyed 14 of them, probably destroyed 15and damaged 15. Considerable A.A. fire was encountered and, during the week,we lost 31 fighters, four pilots being rescued. (These casualties include thoseincurred during attacks on shipping, see Coastal Operations.)Night.41. Bomber Command despatched 554 sorties, compared with 878 in theprevious week. Operations were considerably hampered throughout the week bypersistent bad weather and on two nights had to be cancelled. The main weightof our offensive was again concentrated on industrial and railway centres inGermany. The total of 525 tons of H.E. bombs and 44,545 incendiaries releasedduring &apos; the period under review shows a considerable reduction, due to the prevailing weather, below the previous week. A number of the heaviest typebombs were employed and in all the major attacks numerous large fires were leftburning.42. Mannheim was raided on three occasions, during which a total of 187tons of H.E. bombs and 13,650 incendiaries were dropped; two 4,000 lb. bombswhich fell near the industrial district created huge explosions followed byenormous fires. A series of continued explosions elsewhere in the same area wasalso reported. Cologne was heavily attacked on one night (90 tons of HE. bombs and 6,500 incendiaries). Lighter scale attacks were carried out againstDiisseldorf, Karlsruhe and on the docks at Havre.United Kingdom.43. Fighter Command flew a total of 2,534 sorties (719 patrols) by day and476 sorties (313 patrols) by night; the latter totals include dusk and dawnoperations. Cross-Channel offensive operations and shipping patrols account forthe bulk of our effort.44. The operations carried out by the German Air Force units based on theWestern Front were on a small scale and without any special feature the bombing of land targets at night was very ineffective. Most of the incidentsoccurred in the Eastern Counties and were mainly the work of long-range nightfighters.Coastal Operations.45. Coastal Command flew 204 patrols (382 sorties) and provided escortsfor 49 convoys (219 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols carried outby Fighter Command totalled 529 (1,176 sorties).46. Aircraft of Bomber Command, sometimes with fighter protection,searched for and attacked enemy shipping. Off Ijmuiden, Blenheims sank a7,500-ton merchant vessel in convoy and a 500-ton reporting vessel, and scoredhits on five other vessels of a total tonnage of about 14,500 tons. A 3,500-ton merchant vessel in convoy off Norderney and two 700-ton trawlers near Calaiswere also hit.47. Forty-two aircraft were engaged in laying sea-mines off Brest, Lorient,St. Nazaire and the Frisian Islands and in the Western Baltic.
48. German operations during daylight were almost wholly confined tooversea reconnaissance. The Condor unit operating from Bordeaux was activeover the Atlantic west of Eire, due west from Bordeaux and to the south-west,off the ooast of Portugal. Few shipping attacks were carried out during theweek, although most of the offensive effort was directed to this phase of operations. One daylight attack was made off the Faroes, and five were made atdusk off East Anglia, St. David&apos;s Head, Holy Island, the Smalls and EastScotland.Central Mediterranean.49. Attacks were made on Tripoli (L) on five nights; Wellingtons operating from Malta made a total of 52 sorties and dropped over 86 tons of H.E. and incendiary bombs. These attacks, which were most successful, were concentrated on the harbour area, and on military stores and supply dumps. Direct hits weremade on quay warehouses, which were probably destroyed, and some very exten-sive fires were reported in the harbour and in military supply dump area; damage was also caused to shipping and harbour installations, and one merchant vessel was subsequently revealed to have a broken back and to be sunk alongside theSpanish Quay.50. Some successful attacks were again carried out against shipping plyingbetween Sicily and the African Coast. Two Blenheims made three hits on a4,000-ton merchant vessel north-east of Kerkena, which was claimed to be sunk;unfortunately, one of these aircraft hit the mast and crashed in flames. Twoschooners with an escort vessel were attacked and destroyed by four Blenheimsin the Gulf of Sidra. On another occasion a bomb exploded on the deck of a merchant vessel of 1,000 tons, and a schooner was machine-gunned and leftsinking. Other Blenheims, unable to locate any enemy shipping, made an attackon lorries travelling on the Tripoli (L)-Benghazi road. A night attack on the27th/28th August by naval Swordfish resulted in one hit on a vessel of8,000 tons; this was followed by flashes and a red glow.51. The enemy made two minor attacks on Malta by night. On thesecond of these two aircraft believed to be Ju. 88s were seriously damaged by Hurricanes. During daylight on the 26th August, nine Macchi 200s were intercepted by Hurricanes 50 miles from the island; three were shot down, onefalling on to a village in Sicily, and two others were probably destroyed, for theloss of one of our aircraft.Egypt and Cyrenaica.52. Four night attacks were made on Benghazi; these were effective, although they were on a small scale. During daylight on the 21st August, 12 Marylandsaccompanied by fighters bombed Gambut and Menastir; on the return journey theywere intercepted over Sidi Barrani and two mary lands were shot down. Tworaids by a total of 11 mary lands were carried out on a concentration of A.F.V.Snear Ras Uenna (46 miles East of Tobruk) and many direct hits were made on the target. Another good attack was made by nine mary lands on a large enemy dumpnear Bardia.53. Fighters continued to provide shipping protection patrols. On the21st August a series of attacks were attempted by a total of 50 to 60 german aircraft, including fighters. These were intercepted by Tomahawks andHurricanes, who destroyed two Me. 110s, probably destroyed four Me. 110s and damaged eight others; two Hurricanes are missing and one Tomahawk was shot down. On other occasions, whilst patrolling over naval units off Sidi Barrani,Tomahawks destroyed two Ju. 88s, three Me. 109s, and probably destroyed a thirdJu. 88.54. The enemy carried out one night attack against Alexandria and some slight damage was caused in the native quarter south of the harbour, but most ofthe bombs fell in the sea. Small and unsuccessful raids were also made on port said, Ismailia and Mersa Matruh. The aerodrome at Ismailia was bombed onthe 26th/ 27th August, and one aircraft was destroyed on the! ground, and damage was caused to air force property.
55. The enemy daylight activity was varied and more extensive than of late.Machine-gunning attacks were made by single aircraft on our forward positions,and high-level attacks by Ju, 88s. and dive-bombing attacks by Ju. 87s were madeon Tobruk and on shipping in the harbour; seven long-range bombers attackedAlexandria, and to the north of Port Said a hit was made on a tanker with a torpedo. A trawler and a tanker were sunk in Tobruk harbour, and a tanker was damaged, but the aggregate amount of damage during these attacks was not serious.56. Experience has shown that periods of activity by the German Air Forcesuch as that under review are invariably preceded and followed by spells of comparative quiet, and it is considered that difficulties of supply and the main-tenance of serviceability of aircraft make it impossible for intensive operations to be carried out by the Mediterranean force for more than a short time. Whilethe work of the Italian Air Force continues to be rather unenterprising, it is ofconsiderable value to the German Air Force in the Mediterranean and would bea big factor in event of major operations in the Mediterranean.Persia.57. On the 25th August, Hurricanes and Gladiators covered the advanceof our troops, and attacked Ahwaz aerodrome; this target was also bombed by six Blenheims. At least five enemy aircraft were destroyed and two others damaged, and hangars were hit with bombs and set on fire. On the following days further machine-gun attack was made by fighters and six other enemy aircraft were damaged.58. Blenheims operating from Iraq released pamphlets on Teheran, Kaswinand other localities. Airborne troops were successfully landed for the protectionof British families of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. On the 26th August11 Blenheims attacked enemy gun positions on the Pai-Tak Pass, where all bombsfell in the target area.  Vincents carried out tactical reconnaissances.East Africa.59. Aircraft of the Royal Air Force and South African Air Force continuedto attack military targets in the Wolchefit and Debarech areas, and many direct hits were observed. Bombs were also dropped on buildings and M.T. vehicles atAzozo aerodrome.Russia.Russian Air Operations.60. The Russian Air Force continues to offer strong opposition to theGermans in all sectors..61. The Head of the British Military Mission to Moscow visited the battle area around Smolensk on the 20th August. Several German dive-bombers were seen operating against advanced elements, and a number of sorties of Russianbombers in flights of about six were seen operating against objectives in the rear of the enemy. A considerable amount of air activity was taking place, although no actual combats were witnessed, and there appeared to be as many russian aircraft operating in the area as German.62. The Russian air attack on the railway bridge at Cernovoda, in roumania, on the 11th August was very successful. Not only was the bridgehit, but also the pipe-line supplying oil to the port of Constanza. Reports ofthe serviceability of the damaged bridge vary, but the most optimistic one receivedstates that only one train per day can cross it in each direction. All traffic fromBucharest and the rest of Roumania to the important Black Sea port ofConstanza must pass over this bridge.63. Test pilots working at the Central Aero Hydro Dynamical Instituteare employed at night on night fighter defence duties flying M.I.G. aircraft.They operate in special night fighter sectors. The aircraft are not controlledfrom the ground, but find their way back to their own aerodromes by observationof the searchlight layout, of which they are previously informed. These pilotshave accounted for a considerable proportion of the German aircraft brought down in night raids over Moscow.
German Air Operations.64. On the southern Sector of the front, following the occupation of mostof the area west of the Dnieper bend with the exception of Odessa and limitedareas at certain bridgeheads, it is thought that the German Air Force is nowmainly engaged in establishing itself at new forward bases preparatory to thenext phase of operations. These are likely to be either the attempted crossingof the Dnieper or possibly an attack on the Crimea, which, if left intact, wouldprovide a powerful Russian base in the flank of any further progress acrossthe river.65. In the Kiev area little progress has been made and the strength of theRussian Air Force has been effective in harassing the German troops. the advance in the Gomel sector, on the other hand, has been strongly supported bydive-bomber and fighter units; the latter are known to be acting also as fighter-bombers carrying bombs up to 50 Kg.66. Leningrad has become the immediate objective on the northern partof the front and it is estimated that in this Sector the German Air Force has a strength of approximately 1,000 aircraft, half of which consist of bomber andbomber-reconnaissance types.Visit to Aircraft Factory at Moscow.67. Members of the British Air and Economic Mission paid a visit toNo. 1 Aeroplane Factory at Moscow on the 5th August, 1941. When the Missioninspected the factory it was working at full output, despite the fact that theGermans claim that it has been severely bombed in recent air raids.One member of the Mission who had previously visited this factory in 1933,1935 and 1936, was greatly impressed with the vastly improved organisation which was evident. There was an air of orderliness and efficiency which hadbeen lacking on previous visits. It is in this factory that the M.I.G. 3, the fastestRussian single-seater fighter, is built.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.68.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports. -The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : Germany.Hanover. As a result of the attack on the 3rd/4th August, railwaycommunication to Wunstorf and Bremen was severely dislocated for two days and in the Hainholz Goods Station 140 loaded wagons were destroyed and damage was severe.Karlsruhe. In the raid on the 5th/6th August the main station and thegoods station were damaged and several, blocks of houses near the main station were destroyed. The largest brewery suffered heavily, the town barracks was hit and fires were caused in the industrial part of the town.Hamburg. In the raid on the 2nd/3rd August considerable damage was caused in the Reeperbahn Strasse, one of the main streets in the. St. Pauli district.An informant who has recently visited the city confirms previous reports of damage in the heart thereof. He states that the inhabitants had been mostimpressed by the amount of destruction caused to the Deutscheverft by a singlebomb.Cologne. In photographs taken on the 21st August considerable parts of thecity are obliterated by cloud. It is not possible therefore to obtain any idea ofthe real success of recent attacks. The photographs show, however, a severely damaged area in the Dom Strasse (to the north of the main station), believed tohave been caused by a 4,000-lb. bomb, a heavily damaged area to the south of thecity library caused in the main by fire, and a further such area in the HertzogStrasse near by.Mannheim: In the raid on the 22nd/23rd July, Brown Boveri (electricalengineers), the Lanz Works (agricultural equipment) and two rayon fibre factorieswere all hit.Industrial. Coal production in Germany is said to have declined by a third,and a considerable part of this decline is attributable to R.A.F. activity.General. The German press, speaking of the summer holiday traffic in 1940,states that a shifting to districts in the east of Germany which are far removed from the front line and not endangered by air raids has become very noticeable.A comparison of the number of nights spent by tourists in various districts withthe summer of 1939 reveals the following changes -;-  &apos;Per cent.+ 17N.E. Germany    ...      ......      ...... .   22Sudetenland                .........      &quot;&apos; _ 5Central Germany ...      ............ _ gWestern Germany.......... ^North Germany   ...    . ....      -------25South Germany   ......On several occasions recently the German press has specifically drawn atten-tion to the increase in casualties caused in air raids by persons not having gone to shelter, and these articles end with an exhortation to all people to go to shelteras soon as the warning sounds.
France.Lille Area. Several reports tell of the damage and effect of our raids in north France. Owing to lack of power only half of the pit-heads at Lens were working in the first week of August, those at Moules were stopped on the27th July for twelve days and factories in the Lille district are stated to be operating at about 50 per cent, capacity. The Germans have appreciated thisstoppage to industry caused by our successful attacks on power stations, and areerecting high tension cables to enable the power resources of Central France to bebrought into play.Photographs taken during the daylight attack on the Fives Steel and engineering Works on the 18th August show direct hits in the north and north-eastern parts of the works. The photographs show the damage to the south partof the works caused in previous raids.
