naval SITUATION.General Review.1. Shipping losses were higher than last week, though still below theaverage.Naval aircraft have attacked the harbours of Petsamo and Kirkenes.An attack on Malta by Italian light torpedo craft was beaten off with heavy losses to the enemy.Home Waters.2.   The twelfth Canadian troop convoy has arrived safely in Home Waters.Three M.T.Bs. attacked an enemy tanker which was in tow off Boulogneon the night of the 23rd/24th. Heavy opposition from the escorts prevented allbut one M.T.B. firing torpedoes, and the result of this attack is doubtful.H.M. Destroyers Verity and Broke were damaged in collision off the BloodyPoreland on the 26th.Arctic.3. .The ports of Petsamo and Kirkenes were attacked by naval aircraft onthe 30th. At Petsamo, aircraft from H.M.S. Furious torpedoed jetties and seton fire an oil cistern and a warehouse. One Me. 109 was shot down, our casualtiesbeing two fighters and one torpedo aircraft. -wio^fiefAt Kirkenes, aircraft from H.M.S. Victorious o&amp;aise^ two hits on theGerman&apos; Bremse (1,460 tons, 4 5-inch guns), and at least 4 merchant ships were hit. Two Me. 109s and one Ju. 87 were shot down, our losses being 11 torpedoaircraft and two fighters.Atlantic.4. H.M. Destroyer A chates was damaged by mine 40 miles to the south-east of Iceland (C) on the 25th, and was towed to Seyclisfiord.The German s.s. Erlangen, which left Mar del Plata (Argentine) on the23rd, scuttled herself about 400 miles to the south-eastward when intercepted by H.M.S. Newcastle on the 25th.On the 19th H.M. Submarine Tuna obtained 2 torpedo hits on a largemerchant ship in the Bay of Biscay.Mediterranean.5. During the attacks on the convoy which arrived at Malta on the 24th,12 enemy aircraft were shot down; two more were probably destroyed and two were damaged; our losses were 6 aircraft, of which four crews were rescued.An E-boat was sunk and another probably damaged, and a U-boat, whosetorpedoes narrowly missed the Renown, was attacked and possibly sunk byH.M. Destroyer Nestor. In the Eastern Mediterranean the fleet was shadowedbut was not attacked.On the 26th the Grand Harbour, Valletta, was heavily but unsuccessfully attacked by E-boats and two-man submarines. Five E-boats and 8 submarines were destroyed by the harbour defences, the greater part of which are manned bythe Royal Malta Artillery. In addition, 4 E-boats were sunk and 2 were damaged by Hurricanes.  Three officers and 15 ratings were taken prisoner.HM. Submarine Upright attacked a floating dock, which was proceeding in tow round Cape Spartivento to the westward on the 24th. On the 28th,HM. Submarine Upholder hit with 2 torpedoes an Italian 6-inch cruiser of theCondottieri class (7,000 tons, built in 1935-36).During the week 8 French merchant ships (upward of 18,000 tons) have passed Gibraltar east-bound, and 2 (8,300 tons) west-bound.
Anti-Submarine Operations.6. There were ten attacks on U-boats during the week, five by aircraft and five by surface ships, without visible result. One attack by aircraft was made inthe Heligoland Bight, and one by surface craft to the westward of Algiers; the others took place on the Atlantic seaboard between the latitudes of Finisterre andNorthern Ireland.Enemy Intelligence.Main Units.7. The Scharnhorst had returned to Brest by the 26th July and was in the dry dock there on the following day. She was reported to be down by the stern andlisting on arrival. Apart from this there have been no. changes in the positions of the German and Italian main units.U-Boats.8. About 20 German and 5 Italian U-boats have been working in theEastern Atlantic between the latitudes of the north of Scotland and Gibraltar,and in addition 5 German U-boats have been in the Cape Verde Islands area.Raiders.9. There have been no recent reports of raiders, but there are indications of one in the Southern Indian Ocean, and one is suspected in the southern partof the North Atlantic.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.10. Shipping casualties have increased this week owing to losses inflictedby U-boats, which sank at least 7 ships of an outward-bound convoy to the west of Spain, and one in an outward-bound convoy off the Bloody Foreland. weather conditions have been unfavourable for air attack; one ship was sunk off the tyne.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending the 30th July, 1,021 ships, including 177 allied and 28 neutral, were convoyed. Six anti-aircraft ships, ten armed merchant cruisers, two submarines, sixty destroyers and ninety-nine sloops, corvettes andfleet minesweepers were employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the26th July totalled 615,475 tons compared with 580,737 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 836,668 tons during the past ten weeks. Oil imports were 177,247 tons compared with 139,439 tons during the week ending the19th July. Mineral imports were 142,756 tons, of. which 104,845 tons were steel,scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. Timber and pulp imports were 35,056 tons andcereal imports 131,966 tons. Other food imports totalled 71,899 tons, theprincipal commodities being sugar 26,420 tons, refrigerated and tinned meat,bacon and ham 10,521 tons, fruit 4,213 tons,, cheese 1,803 tons and tea 1,594 tons.Imports of motor lorries, aircraft and war stores were very satisfactory.British Minelaying.12. H.M.S. Port Quebec laid 556 mines to the north of North E,ona. and motor launches laid 48 off the French Channel ports. Minelaying by aircraft was concentrated in the Western Baltic, though some mines were laid off the enemyNorth Sea, Channel and Bay of Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.13. No casualties have been caused by mines during the week. Aircraftlaid mines in the Thames Estuary on one night. A number of mines have been located during the period, but the majority were not laid recently. The mine totalto date is : magnetic 1,308, acoustic 912&apos; contact 1,020.
Enemy Merchant Shipping.14. About the 19th July fire broke out in the Italian Capo Faro whilstloading, and much damage was done to part of the cargo.The Italian tankers Albaro (3,706 tons) and Mayo (3,667 tons) and the bulgarian B our gas (2,940 tons) are reported to have passed into the Black Sea.A survey of enemy shipping, including ships under enemy control, on the30th June indicates that there was a maximum of four million tons for work inNorthern European waters from Murmansk to the Straits of Gibraltar. Anestimate of shipping required for the Baltic and the full-scale resumption ofthe Scandinavian ore trade suggests that 3^ million tons would be required forthese purposes.Russian Intelligence.15. The movement of German forces across the Dniester has necessitated the evacuation of the naval establishment at Odessa.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.16. There have been no developments of decisive importance during thepast week, though German forces have advanced in varying degree on all fronts.Finland-.&apos;17. In the area north of Lake Ladoga, Finnish and German troops have advanced to within a short distance of Olonets on the eastern shore of the lakeand 22 miles from the Leningrad-Murmansk Railway. No progress has been attempted in the Karelian Isthmus.   At Ffango artillery activity continues.Baltic Front.18. Little progress has been made by German forces. Soviet forces appearto be withdrawing from Northern Estonia, but the German occupation of thesouthern coast of the Gulf of Finland is not yet confirmed. Further east theGerman line runs roughly from south-east of Narva-Luga-Dno (55 miles east ofPskov). The area east of Lake Peipus has been cleared of Soviet forces. the drive towards Leningrad is apparently held up by considerable Soviet forces, butthere are indications of the possibility of a German drive due eastwards, southof Lake Ilmen, to cut the Leningrad-Moscow railway.White Russia.19. The severest fighting is taking place on this front. Fighting west ofSmolensk has ceased, so that the German claim to have cleared up this pocketof Soviet resistance appears to be true. German progress east of Smolensk isbeing impeded by considerable Soviet counter-attacks, and the position is veryconfused. To the southward German forces have crossed the River Dnieperdown to Rogachev, where considerable Soviet counter-attacks are proceeding.Ukraine-Bessarabia.20. The German advance towards Kiev has not progressed. The maineffort on this front seems to be south-eastwards from Berdichev and north-east-wards from Balta. The Dniester defences are virtually enveloped, the Germanshaving crossed the river at all points to within some 30 miles north-west ofTiraspol. The position of Soviet forces in that part of Bessarabia which still remains in Soviet hands is obscure, but the German claim to have &quot; liberated &quot;the whole of Bessarabia is virtually correct.
Operations.Libya and Egypt.Tobruk.21. During the week under review our patrolling activities have continued.On the night of 23rd/21th July six fighting patrols were sent out. On the25th/26th July a patrol of two Indian officers and 16 other ranks attacked four enemy positions west of the perimeter, killing 25 of the enemy, mostly with thebayonet. During this week enemy raids have been carried out on Tobruk, with little success.Frontier Area.22. There has been a certain amount of activity by enemy ground patrols.The most notable incident occurred on the 27th July, when two strong enemyoffensive patrols operating in this area were engaged by our mobile columns and forced to withdraw. On the 28th July there was an increase in enemy activity,and we captured a few prisoners.Syria.23. Vichy French garrison in Suweida, in the Jebel Druze Area, has been relieved by our forces.Reinforcements.24. Reinforcements of 10,000 Australian and 4,000 New Zealand troops have arrived at Suez..The 2nd South African Division, less one brigade group, is completing itsconcentration in Egypt.Intelligence.German Activities.25. The number of divisions in the whole of the Low Countries and Franceis now believed to have been reduced to about 35, of which two are in the Nether-lands and three in Belgium. Only two of the total are active divisions and onemay be motorised.Norway.26. The number of German divisions in Norway is still estimated at eight,but it may have been reduced recently. The quality of the troops is probablylower than before.Spain.27. Reports are still being received of improvements in communications insouth-west France towards the Spanish Frontier. Coast and anti-aircraft defences in the Bayonne area are also being developed.The number of German divisions south of Bordeaux has fallen from sevento five, all of which are of poor quality.While there is no indication of an immediate threat to Spain, the necessarytroops (including armoured divisions) for an advance into Spain, in face of resistance, could probably be assembled in some seven weeks after the end of theRussian campaign. If, on the other hand, Spain acquiesced in the passage ofGerman troops, the force required could be assembled in little over a week.Balkans.28. It is estimated that there are not more than five German divisions in the Balkan area, one being based on Crete, one in Salonica and the other threein Greece and Serbia.Bulgaria.29. The Bulgarian Army remains fully mobilised at seventeen divisions and work on existing aerodromes continues with German assistance. There has been no confirmation, however, of any unusual military activity during the past week.
Turkey.30. The Turks are displaying great activity in the construction of the new works in the Catalca Lines and appear to be making every effort to complete them before the winter.Libya.31. Army General Ettore Bastico, lately Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Islands in the ^aegean, has replaced General Gariboldi asGovernor-General and Commander-in-Chief, Libya. He is a strong Eascist andan energetic commander, and has had considerable experience with mechanizedforces. He may be expected to adopt more aggressive tactics than those whichhave recently characterised the Italian Army in Libya.French A frica.32. The total number of troops in French North Africa is estimated to beabout 120,000, as approved by the Armistice Commission at Wiesbaden. Some55,000 are in Morocco, 45,000 in Algeria and the balance in Tunisia.Vichy forces in West Africa total approximately 35,000.Japan.33. The Japanese army has been very active during the past week,particularly in Southern Indo-China, where sea and air bases are being occupied,and in Manchukuo, where military preparations are continuing.In North China, there are indications that two or more divisions have been withdrawn to Manchukuo, while the withdrawal of some troops from CentralChina has also been reported.In. Japan itself partial mobilization of over 13 classes of reservists is taking-place, with the probable object of bringing up to war strength the divisions in,or destined for, Manchuria.Present indications suggest that in the immediate future Japan will consoli-date her position in Indo-China, whilst taking measures to increase her controlover Thailand and preparing for possible action against U.S.S.R. fromManchukuo.Manchukuo.34. There have been several reports to show that troop concentrations aretaking place on the eastern boundary of Manchukuo, and that the number oftroops in the country is being considerably increased. At the same time thetransport of supplies and stores from Japan has continued and there have beenreports of railway congestion on the Korean and Manchukuo railways owing tothe volume of military traffic passing over them.Southern Indo-China.35. The occupation of Southern Indo-China by Japanese forces began onthe 27th July with a landing at Nhatrang and subsequently at Cap St. Jacquesand Saigon.   The Japanese forces so far involved amount to about two Divisions.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. In the early part of the week, a successful attack was made in daylightagainst enemy warships at Brest and La Pallice, and, at night, industrialobjectives in Berlin, German shipyards and railway centres were attacked.Later the weather deteriorated, and on three nights no bombing was possible.Offensive operations by Fighter Command were also curtailed.Enemy activity over this country was on a very small scale-Aircraft from Malta successfully attacked aircraft on Sicilian aerodromes.They also co-operated in repelling the enemy naval raid on the Grand Harbour.
Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.37. Bomber Command despatched 206 sorties (compared with 110 last week),and 160 tons of H.E. bombs were dropped by day. Fighter Command flew sortiesinvolving 709 aircraft.38. The attack on the Scharnhorst at La Pallice on the night 23rd/24thJuly was followed the next afternoon by a raid by Halifax bombers on the sametarget. Twenty-five tons of H.E. bombs were dropped and at least one bomb hitthe ship, which subsequently returned to Brest, where she was dry-docked.39. While this attack was in progress at La Pallice, strong forces of bombers, including Fortresses, were despatched, with fighter cover, to attack the Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen at Brest, and to carry out a diversionary raidon Cherbourg. These operations involved the largest number of sorties by bomber command that has been despatched during daylight on any day since theoutbreak of war, a total of 149 aircraft being employed.Our bombing forces carried out their tasks with great success in the face of strong defence by enemy fighters and A.A. fire. The Gneisenau was hit seventimes and the Prinz Eugen and a large tanker were probably damaged. Apartfrom these hits, many bursts were observed on and around the clocks at Brest,and severe damage was inflicted upon barracks and buildings adjacent to the targets. At Cherbourg, bombs fell in the town and dock area and a warehousewas set on fire. On the same afternoon, 9 Blenheims of Coastal Command, with fighter protection, attacked the railway centre at Hazebrouck; several fires were started.During the day our bombers destroyed 21 enemy fighters, probably destroyed7 and damaged 9. Sixteen of our bombers failed to return. Our escorting fightersinflicted additional casualties, totalling 12 destroyed, 5 probables and 5 damaged;we lost 8 fighters (one pilot being rescued) out of 529 aircraft despatched by fighter Command during these operations.Night.40. On the night 23rd/24th, 25 Whit-leys and 7 Beauforts attacked the scharnhorst at La Pallice; several fires were started but searchlight dazzleimpeded observation.   (This attack was omitted from last week&apos;s Resume).41. This week Bomber Command despatched 454 night sorties, comparedwith 638 last week. A total of 335 tons of H.E. bombs and 28,200 incendiaries were dropped. The principal targets were shipyards at Kiel and Emden, railway centres at Hanover, Hamburg and Cologne, and the industrial centre of Berlin.Night offensive patrols by fighters were continued over enemy territory.42. At Kiel, visibility was good and very satisfactory results were seen at both the Deutsche and Krupp shipyards; a large explosion, believed to be at theMain Railway Station, was also observed.At Emden, which was the most heavily attacked objective (56 tons of H.E.bombs and 6,120 incendiaries), many large and small fires were started, whichmerged into one large blaze. A fast-running fire, possibly from burning petrol,was reported.Good results were obtained at Hanover and Hamburg, bursts, with resultantfires, being observed in the target areas in each city.Very bad weather, with much cloud, was encountered at Cologne. Somefires were, however, started in the estimated target area. A number of our aircraft were forced by thunderstorms and severe icing to abandon their task;others located and attacked Aachen as an alternative target, two of the heaviestbombs being dropped.Seven Stirlings and 2 Halifax bombers were despatched to attack Berlin, and14 tons of H.E. bombs were released. These included one of the heaviest bombs,and it is believed to have fallen between the Tiergarten and TempelhofAerodrome.
United Kingdom.43. Fighter Command flew 863 patrols, involving 2,409 sorties, by clay,and 276 patrols, involving 419 sorties, by night; the latter totals include dusk anddawn operations. These figures show a decrease over those of the previousweek. Enemy activity continued on a small scale, and during daylight very fewhostile aircraft penetrated inland; three Ju. 88s were destroyed and another was damaged.44. On the night 27th/28th July, an attack was made on London, but it was neither heavy nor concentrated; it was announced as a reprisal for the raid on berlin on the 25th/26th. Ju. 88 night fighters took part in this attack, carryingtheir normal load of eight to ten 50-kilo. bombs; this affords some indication ofthe depleted strength of the German bomber force on the Western Front, Duringthis raid four enemy aircraft were destroyed. On other nights scattered bombs were dropped in Scotland, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire and in east anglia, but the total number of long-range night bombers employed amountedonly to 95.Coastal Operations.45. Coastal Command flew 234 patrols (339 sorties) and provided escorts for72 patrols (248 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols carried out by fighter Command totalled 674 (1,409 sorties).46. Aircraft from Bomber. Coastal and Fighter Commands were extensivelyengaged in searches for enemy shipping. On one day, during operations by43 Blenheims of Bomber Command, five merchant vessels, totalling about 6,000tons, are claimed as destroyed. On other days, Fighter Command carried outpromising attacks, several ships being hit with machine-gun and cannon fire.47: A total of 100 aircraft were employed in laying sea mines in theWestern Baltic and off Kiel, Lorient, Havre, Ftouen and the Frisian Islands.48. Enemy reconnaissance of shipping was not on a heavy scale, and theonly attack on a convoy was made off the Tyne on the night 29th/30th. On one night, fifteen enemy aircraft laid mines in the Thames Estuary, but, during theremainder of the week, no mining operations were undertaken off our coasts.Central Mediterranean.49. In daylight on the 23rd July, four Blenheims operating from Maltamade a successful attack on shipping at Trapani (N.W. Coast of Sicily). a merchant vessel of 7,000 tons was hit, and left in flames, and another vessel of3,000 tons was hit twice and is believed to have sunk. The aircraft then raidedan enemy aerodrome and destroyed three S. 79s, and damaged others. On the28th two direct hits were made on a laden schooner west of Pantellaria, whichlater probably sank.50. Beaufighters based on Malta took a heavy toll of Italian aircraft. Onthe 28th July, eight of these fighters split into pairs and attacked aircraft on theground or moored seaplanes at Catania, Borizzo, Syracuse and Marsala. As aresult of this raid they claimed to have destroyed 15 S. 79s, 14 Cant. Z. 501s and4 Macchi 200s, in addition to which about  5 of the ground staff were killed atBorizzo. Photographs taken the following day indicate that these figures are probably an underestimate of the actual damage caused.51. Two days later, six Beaufighters carried out a similar attack on Elmasaerodrome and seaplane base in Sardinia. Five aircraft and seaplanes were destroyed and seven others seriously damaged, while many other aircraft weresprayed with cannon and machine-gun fire. A large fire was started in a seaplanehangar, and all the crew of a heavy A.A. gun were believed to have been killed. Onthe return journey, a four-engined transport aircraft was probably destroyed southof. Pantellaria. Beaufighters on escort duty on the 24th July shot down twoJu. 87s.   From these operations all the Beaufighters returned safely.52. On the 25th July, 2 Italian bombers, escorted by about 40 fighters,attempted a reconnaissance of Malta; Hurricanes intercepted and shot down
the 2 bombers and 3 of the fighters. On the following day, our Hurricanesco-operated with the coast defences in repelling an attempted attack on GrandHarbour by enemy light forces. These fighters sank 4 &quot; E &quot; boats and damagedothers^ and also shot down 3 of the enemy fighter escort. The enemy carried outthree small night attacks on Malta, without causing any damage of consequence.Egypt and Cyrenaica.53. Daylight activity continued to be on a small scale. Covering patrols were maintained for protection of our shipping, and on the 29th July a largenumber of Ju. 87s, escorted by Me. 109s, made an attack on one of our.convoys;a patrol of Tomahawks and Hurricanes intercepted the attackers and shot down4 Ju. 87s; two other Ju. 87s were probably destroyed and 10 Ju. 87s and2 Me. 109s damaged. Two of our Tomahawks are missing, and a lighter was sunk. Nightly attacks on the harbour of Benghazi were again carried out by wellingtons, and many hits were made and fires started.54. The enemy made several small daylight raids on Tobruk; on one occasion the lighting installation was put out of action, but, in general, very little damage was caused and many of the bombs fell in the sea. Bombs were alsodropped at Matruhj in the Sofafi area and south of Sblltim, but no serious damageresulted:55. At night, attacks were carried out, by forces which did not exceed tenaircraft on any one occasion, on Alexandria, Port Said and in the Delta area.At Alexandria; some parachute mines were dropped, and damage was caused to house property, to cables and water mains; and to a Royal Air Force base. the objects of these raids is largely political. They are intended to weaken Egyptianmorale and to stimulate a demand for the withdrawal of British forces from certain areas.Russia.General.56. There is no comprehensive information of Russian air operations, but some reports are available from Finland and Rumania. There are full accounts of attacks on Moscow.Finland.57. About fifteen Finnish towns have been bombed. Twentj^-nine Russianbombers dropped bombs on both sides of the Naval Barracks at Abo, where thereare Germans stationed. Windows were broken, but the barracks were not hit.Twenty aircraft raided Borga, five of which were shot down by eight Finnishfighters. There have been reports of Russians being dropped by parachute, some in civilian dress, but almost all of them have been rounded up. Most of theseparachutists were dropped in the Helsinki-Hyvinkaa-Borga area.58. Up to the 12th July, 1941, 94 Russian aircraft are repotted to havebeen shot down by the Finns, 79 by fighter aircraft, 15 by anti-aircraft fire.Fifteen Russian aircraft were brought down over Finland on the 22nd July,7 in the spilth and 8 in the north. The Finnish Air Staff report the lossof 11 Finnish aircraft since operations against Russia began. The Russians are said to be using mostly i. 15 and I. 15 (3) fighter aircraft over the Finnish frontier.Some I. 18 aircraft have been seen over Finland aiid are much feared by theFinnish pilots.Rumania.59. A further report has been received indicating that the Russian bombing of the oil fields at Ploesti has been effective, though the statement that the produc-tion has been reduced by about one-third may be exaggerated. The Soviet AirForce made an attack on Giurgiu on the 23rd July and attempted to dropincendiary bombs 6ii oil installations, but it is thought that the&apos; raid was not a.success.
German Air Operations.60. There is little doubt that in spite of the absence of movement theGerman Air Force has maintained a steady pressure against the Russians on thewhole front; at the same time it has had time to consolidate its more advancedpositions and it is likely that the immediate problems of supply and maintenanceon the field may by now have been somewhat eased, thus facilitating the develop-ment of the next phase of operations.61. There was an air raid on Moscow on the 21st July which lasted about six hours and was on a fairly heavy scale. The main objectives were apparentlythe railway station, industrial areas and aerodromes. Several large fires were caused by enemy aircraft which flew over at a medium height. The Soviet A.A.defences, of which a large proportion were light anti-aircraft guns, put up whatwas described as &quot; an impressive show.&quot; The searchlights frequently held theattacking aircraft quite well. Incendiary bombs fell on the roof of the british embassy but the fire was tackled immediately by the Embassy staff, both russian and English, and by the Moscow fire brigade.62. Another raid was made on Moscow on the 22nd July and was directed against the morale of the citizens. It is stated that the morale of the Muscoviteswas not affected any more by this raid than by the one on the previous night Onthe night of the 23rd/24th July there was an attempted mass raid by about 150German bombers, of which only 5 to 6 per cent, pierced the defences. Five air-craft are said to have been shot down but no military objectives were damaged.Some dwelling houses were set on fire but they were soon put out by the fire brigades and by the people. A small daylight attack appears to have been madein the vicinity of Moscow on the 25th July by a formation of six bombers, ofwhich five were shot down.  There is no report of any damage.63., The latest raid of which reports have been received is the raid of the28th July, which lasted from midnight on the 28th to 0230 hours on the 29th.The raid finished earlier than usual, no doubt clue to the German casualtiessuffered during the approach to and the return from the city in daylight. nearly all the German aircraft approached from the south and east, but very few flew over the centre of the city. All bombing took place at a high altitude, and incendiary bombs were dropped only at the beginning of the raid. By 0030hours a large fire had been started in the southern outskirts of the city andGerman aircraft concentrated their attacks on this. At least two and possiblymore mines were dropped, but bombs are stated to have been dropped singly andnot in sticks. All were of large size. The Germans used many more parachuteflares than in the earlier raids, and the Russians wasted much ammunition trying to shoot them down. Owing to the height at which the bombers flew, the Russiansearchlights had little success in picking up the attacking aircraft, and bothheavy and light A.A. guns put a heavy barrage throughout the whole raid. Atone time 107 searchlights were in action on the Moscow perimeter. It is estimatedthat the scale of attack was about 40 per cent, less than the raids on the first two nights.Air Intelligence.Turkey.64. The Turks have further reduced their aerodrome programme from 14to 5 owing to their heavy commitments in aerodrome construction. The area ofthe runways has also been reduced in all cases. Work has apparently not yet been started on this programme, and, although scheduled for completion by the endof October, it is extremely unlikely that it will be completed by that date.65. The Chief of the Turkish Air Force has directed that all flying training at Eskishehir is to be under British control. The first batch of 20 of a total party of 80 cadets to be sent to England for training has now left Turkey. Theremainder will leave in August and September.Iran (Persia).66. Nine Tomahawks have arrived at Bandar Shahpur from the UnitedStates.   A test pilot and riggers have passed through Karachi on their way to
Iran. Only six British technicians now remain in Tehran. Eight more will berequired if Hurricanes are to be produced.The Germans are reported to be taking photographs and obtaining details of landing grounds, particularly in Southern Iran and Kuzistan, in addition toother similar activities.Japan.67. As a result of the agreement with Vichy, the Japanese have secured theright to use and garrison at least eight aerodromes in Indo-China. Thirty T. 96naval heavy bombers are reported to have arrived at Saigon on the 26th July.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.68. The only bombs, on land, during the week were dropped harmlessly atCleethorpes on the 29th July.By Night.69. Except on one night, bombing was confined to minor incidents, mostlynear the East Coast.On the night 27th/28th July there was a raid of light intensity, lastingfor 2\ hours, on London, with minor incidents in adjoining counties. This wasthe first time bombs had dropped in the London Region since 21st/22nd June, andthe first raid on London of any magnitude since 10th/11th i*uie.Ata*Damage.70. London (27th/28th July). There were only two medium fires and fivesmall outbreaks. A high proportion of bombs were of light weight but damage,although mostly confined to house property, was somewhat heavy, especially inBetlmal Green, Poplar, Islington, Wandsworth and Surbiton. Two large gasmains were hit in Poplar and two large water mains north of the river. Railwaydamage was all repaired by 1800 hours the following evening.J. Pain and Sons, Ltd., Mitcham (Armament and Explosive production),suffered slight damage.Casualties were also high in proportion to the bombs dropped, but at least30 deaths, out of the region&apos;s total of 90, were due to bombs which hit a publicshelter and two surface shelters in Poplar.Casualties.71. The casualties for the week ending 0600, the 30th July, are estimatedat 104 killed and 139 seriously injured, of which 90 killed and 111 seriously injured were in London.
