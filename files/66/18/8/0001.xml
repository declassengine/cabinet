THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S (KWKRMJENT .SECRET &quot;     - - COPY NO       ?,&amp;- * IW.P. (41)1851ST AUGUST, 1941.WAR CABINET.SITES FOR SUTURE AERODROMES.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture a.nd Fisheries.1. The Air Ministry require more aerodromes.    They must of course Viavesufficient land to provide &apos;them*   The question is not how much land they should havetilt which land,2, Machinery is required to decide this.    In my view the present liaisonprocedure has broken down;    I am entitled to raise objections but the Secretary of -State for Air reserves the final decision.3e I only raise objection in cases where land is of outstanding productivity.4, The Air Ministry naturally prefer gooci agricultural land because it isflat and well drained.   They object to sites which involve(i) road diversion(ii) diversion of the Grid(iii) land over the 600 ft. contour line(iv^ removal of trees or scrub on any considerable sca.le(v) levelling of undulating land or drainage of wet land.5. Where for their own operational reasons aerodromes have to be locatedat sites where all these requirements cannot be met, the Air Ministry have in somecases abandoned their objections.    In analogous cases where I urge modification toavoid, removal from food production of really good agricultural land there is atpresent no means of ensuring that agricultural considerations are given properweight&apos;.6. The amount of first-class agricultural land in this country is very limited.I understand the Air Ministry now have their eye on some of the very best in theworld.7, To avoid waste and ensure that the best use is me.de of our land for our war effort I request that machinery should be set up to determine priorities in the/event of Departmental disagreement.&apos;8. I suggest that these questions should be submitted for settlement to aWar Cabinet Minister, whose decision should be final.(intld.)
