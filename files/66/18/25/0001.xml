To it is appended, in Annex III,- a-reporton the conversations between the British and American Chiefs of StaffiI also attach (Annex IV) a diary, and record of the personnel of the Mission.I would draw special attention to the holding of Divine Service on .the quarter-deck of H.M.S. Prince of Wales, attended by President Roosevelt, with, his staffof officers and representatives of all ranks of the United States Navy, andMarines.   All were impressed with this episode.w. s. c.August 20, 1941.[22827] b
JOINT ANGLO-AMERICAN DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.AT one of our first conversations, the President told me that he thought itwould be good if we could draw up a joint declaration laying down certain broad principles which guide our policies along the same road.Wishing to follow up this most hopeful suggestion, I gave him, onAugust 10, a tentative outline of such a declaration.   The text was as follows :  The President, of the United States of America and the Prime Minister,Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom, being met together to resolve and concert the means of providingfor the safety of their respective countries in face of Nazi and german aggression and of the dangers to all peoples arising therefrom, deem it rightto make known certain principles which they both accept for guidance inthe framing of their policy and on which they base their hopes for a betterfuture for the world.First, their countries seek no aggrandisement, territorial or other;Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord withthe freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned;Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of Govern-ment under which they will live; they are only concerned to defend the rightsof freedom of Speech and Thought, without which such choice must beillusory;Fourth, they will strive to bring about a fair and equitable distributionof essential produce, not only within their territorial boundaries, but betweenthe nations of the world;Fifth,-they seek a Peace which will not only cast down forever the Nazityranny, but by effective international organisation will afford to all Statesand Peoples the means of dwelling in security within their own bounds, andof traversing the seas and oceans without fear of lawless assault or the need of maintaining burdensome armaments.At our meeting on the morning of August 11 the President gave me a revised draft (Annex I), which we took as a basis of discussion.Before examining this document the President explained that his idea wasthat there should be issued simultaneously in Washington and London, perhapson the 14th August, a short statement to the effect that the President and thePrime Minister had held conversations at sea, that they had been accompaniedhy members of their respective staffs; that the latter had discussed the working out of aid to the democracies in the Lease and Lend Act; that these naval andmilitary conversations had in no way been concerned with future commitmentsOther than as authorised by Act of Congress.
The statement would proceed to say that the Prime Minister and thepresident had discussed certain principles relating to the civilisation of the world(&quot; and had agreed on a statement of them.I deprecated the emphasis which a statement on these lines would lay on theabsence of commitments. This would be seized on by Germany and would be a source of profound discouragement to the neutrals and to the vanquished. Ivery much hoped, therefore, that the President could confine the statement to the positive portion which dealt with the question of aid to the democracies, moreespecially as the President had guarded himself by the reference to the Lease-and-Lend Act.(       The President accepted this. -There followed a detailed discussion of the revised text of the declaration.Several minor alterations were easily agreed.The chief difficulties were presented by Points 4 and 7, especially the former.With regard to this, I pointed out that the words &quot; without discrimination &quot;might be held to call in question the Ottawa agreements, and I was in no1 positionto accept them. This text would certainly have to be referred to the Govern-ment at home and, if it was desired to maintain the present wording, to theGovernments in the Dominions. I should have little hope that it would beaccepted. Mr. Sumner Welles indicated that this was the core of the matter, andthat this paragraph embodied the ideal for which the Administration had strivenfor the past nine years. I mentioned the British experience in adhering to free trade for eighty years. I said that, if the words &quot; with due respect for theirexisting obligations &quot; could be inserted, and if the words &quot; without discrimina-tion &quot; could disappear, and &quot; trade &quot; be substituted for &quot; markets,&quot; I should beable to refer the text to His Majesty&apos;s Government with some hope that theywould be able to accept it.As regards Point 7, I pointed out that while I accepted this text, opinion in England would be disappointed at the absence of any intention to establish aninternational organization of peace after the war. I promised to try to find asuitable modification, and later in the day I suggested to the President theaddition to the second sentence of the words &quot;pending the establishment of a wider and more permanent system of general security.&apos;&apos;I telegraphed these amendments for immediate submission to the Cabinet..I had not finished dictating the telegram much before 2 p.m., and that I shouldhave had in my hands within the next 12 hours the Cabinet&apos;s most helpfulreply reflects the utmost credit on all concerned.The Cabinet, in their reply, suggested a further variant of Point 4, anddesired the insertion of a new paragraph between Points 4 and 5.Meanwhile, I had heard that the President had accepted all the amendments which I had submitted to him on 11th August.On 12th August, about noon, I went to see the President, to agree withhim the final form of the Declaration.   I was accompanied by Lord Beaverbrook,who had arrived that morning.   I put to the President the Cabinet&apos;s revised version of Point 4, but he preferred to adhere to the phrasing already agreed,[22827] &quot;        b 2
and I did not like to press him further on the point.   He readily accepted the insertion of the new paragraph desired by the Cabinet.   A number of verba1 ,alterations were agreed, and the Declaration was then in its final shape (Annex II).It was only after this that I received the telegram (Abbey 35) giving theresults of the further meeting of the Cabinet on the morning of 12th August.This telegram made clear the reasons for the misgivings which the Cabinet feltOn the subject of Point 4. But I feel that the final text with the words &quot; with duerespect for their existing obligations &quot; governing, as they do, the whole para-graph, sufficiently safeguards our position.The profound and far-reaching importance of this Joint Declaration is )apparent.The fact alone of the United States, still technically neutral, joining witha belligerent Power in making such a Declaration is astonishing.The inclusion in it of a reference to &apos;&apos; the final destruction of the Nazityranny &apos;&apos; (this was based on a phrase appearing in my original draft) amountsto a challenge which in ordinary times would imply warlike action.Finally, not the least striking feature is the realism of the last paragraph,where there is a plain and bold intimation that, after the war, the United states will join with us in policing the world until the establishment of a better order.FAR EAST.Our hope had been to induce the President to give a strong warning to Japanagainst any further encroachment in the South-West Pacific, and to give to us and the Dutch an assurance that we should have the armed support of theUnited States in the event of our being attacked by the Japanese.Accordingly on the 10th August I handed to the President the followingshort memorandum proposing a system of &quot; parallel &quot; communications to theJapanese Government : -&apos;&apos; Declaration by United States Government that 1. Any further encroachment by Japan in the South-West Pacificwould produce a situation in which the United States Government would be compelled to take counter-measures even though these might lead to war between the United States and Japan.2. If any Third Power becomes the object of aggression by Japan inconsequence of such counter-measures or of their support of them, thePresident would have the intention to seek authority from Congress to giveaid to such Power.Declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Same as above, mutatis mutandis, the last phrase reading : : ^ . their support of them, His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldgive all possible aid to such Power.&quot;
Declaration by Dutch Government.Same as that by His Majesty&apos;s Government.Keep the Soviet Government informed.   It will be for consideration whether they should be pressed to make a parallel declaration.On the following morning, the 11th August, I discussed these proposals withthe President.It was clear at once that, on consideration, the President had decided that/ he would be unable to give an assurance that he would go to Congress for authorityto give armed support.He referred to certain negotiations that had been proceeding with theJapanese Government, culminating in a set of proposals by the latter. TheCabinet will have already seen the telegram in which I summarised theseproposals. It is true that they included an assurance that Japan would stationno further troops in the South-Western Pacific area except French Irido-China,and a contingent promise of ultimate withdrawal from the latter. But a numberof the conditions attached were obviously wholly unacceptable.The President declared that he was under no illusion as to the value or the sincerity of these proposals, but he thought it would be useful to pursue a discussion of them, if only for the sake of gaining, say, a month&apos;s time.He assured me that the economic measures against Japan would meanwhilebe maintained in full force, and he seemed to think that this was the most thathe could do. He did not offer to give any further warning to Japan, and I thinkthat in this he may have been under the influence of Mr. Sumner Welles, whoseemed to be of the opinion that the time for warnings was past.I pointed out that the Japanese promise to withdraw from Indo-China was conditional on &quot; the settlement of the China incident.&quot; This plainly indicated that the Japanese intention was to attack Yunnan northward from Indo-Chinaand to cut the Burma Road. It would, therefore, be essential to make it clearthat a condition of continuing discussions with the Japanese would be that theyshould not use Indo-China as a base for operations against China.The President readily agreed to this. He explained that, when thediscussions were resumed, he would renew his proposals for the neutralisationof both Siam and Indo-China.Most important of all, he finally agreed to end his communication to theJapanese Ambassador with a warning, in the words which I had given him onthe previous day, that any further encroachment by Japan &apos;&apos; would produce a situation in which the United States Government would be compelled to takecounter measures, even though these might lead to war between the United Statesand Japan.&quot; He proposed to add that it was, of course, obvious that, the Sovietbeing a friendly Power, the United States Government would be similarlyinterested in any conflict in the North-West Pacific area.I authorised the President to inform Japan that in this matter His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were in accord with the United States Government and would co-operate fully with them.( [22827] c*
The President said that he would at once telegraph to Mr. Cordell Hull to-^arrange for the Japanese Ambassador to call upon him on his return to PWashington, and to tell his Excellency that he would have an important message to deliver.  He would see the Ambassador as soon as possible, and would give him the message in writing.I later asked for a copy of this message, but I was told, at the time of ourdeparture, that it had not yet been drafted.The President, however, assured me, on more than one occasion, that hewould include in it the final words which I have quoted above. Evidently this.is the crucial part of the message, and I am confident that the President will not ^tone it down. He has a copy of the record of our conversation in which thiswording is reproduced. Mr. Sumner Welles undertook that a copy of the draftof the message would be given as soon as possible to His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Washington.Even taken by itself this warning should have a considerable deterrent effecton Japan. And when we remember that the Japanese will already have sufferedthe shock of the Anglo-American joint declaration, I think we may hope thatthey will pause before proceeding to further outrage.ATLANTIC ISLANDS.The President stated that he had indications from certain quarters that aGerman move might be made into the Peninsula about the 15th September. Itwould be possible for his forces, destined for the Azores, to be ready by approxi-mately the same date; that is to say, it would take three weeks to embark themand five to six days to get the ships there. The President had received a note from -Doctor Salazar, dated the 29th July, acknowledging his own communica-tion, in which he had given assurances concerning respect for PortugueseSovereignty over the islands. Prom a passage in this note, the President hadinferred that Portugal would be ready to invoke the aid of the United States if,in certain circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to assist. ThePresident said that in his view the way to proceed would be for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to intimate to Doctor Salazar that they, owing to their preoccupa-tion elsewhere, would be unable to send him the assistance promised, and to ask whether he would therefore accept the assistance of the United States. IfDoctor Salazar agreed, he would have to inform the United States that he would accept their assistance, together with a token contingent from Brazil. ThePresident explained that it was essential for his own purposes that he shouldhave a direct request from Doctor Salazar.I said that we must recognise that the Operation &quot; Pilgrim might firethe whole train in the Peninsula. We must therefore have simultaneously a naval force to protect the Azores, against forestalling German action pendingthe entry of American forces.  The President pointed out that the United StatesJj
Government would be unable to send forces to the Azores and to the Cape Verde( Islands simultaneously.   Moreover, there was this difference, that the formerwere in the Western Hemisphere, whereas the latter were east of 26 degrees.He might be. able to work them into a scheme, but would make no definite promisehere and now.   He added that, unlike Operation &quot; Pilgrim,&quot; the occupationof the Azores could be done in any month of the year.It was agreed that the first step would be for His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto inform the United States Government that they had warned Doctor Salazar ofthe possibility that they would be precluded from giving Portugal the assistance( promised.WESTERN HEMISPHERE DEFENCE PLAN No. 4.A Plan for early assistance by the United States Navy in the Battle of the atlantic had previously been worked out and, as the President now stated thatthe United States were ready to implement this plan, the necessary steps to put it into force were agreed upon.At an early date (it is hoped by the 1st September) the United States Navywill take over the responsibility for the safety of our North Atlantic Convoysto the West of 260 West. They will be assisted by units of the Royal CanadianNavy. With the exception of the occasional escorts necessary for our troopconvoys, we shall thereby be enabled to withdraw the majority of the units of theRoyal Navy now in the Western Atlantic for employment in other areas.This unparalleled gesture of friendship by a neutral Power is to be madeunder the guise of protection for United States communications with Iceland (C).The measures taken will continue to be guided by our own experienced Officers.All details were worked out and agreed in detail by the Naval authorities.w. s. c.c22827j o*2
Annex I.JOINT DECLARATION.[Revised draft handed to the Prime Minister by President Roosevelt,August 11, 1941.)THE President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister,Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,being met together, deem it right to make known certain common principles inthe national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopesfor a better future for the world.First, their countries seek no aggrandisement, territorial or other.Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with thefreely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned.Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of govern-ment under which they will live; and they wish to see self-government restored to those from whom it has been forcibly removed.Fourth, they will endeavour to further the enjoyment by all peoples of access, without discrimination and on equal terms, to the markets and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity.Fifth, they hope to see established a peace, after the final destruction of the nazi tyranny, which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling in securitywithin their own boundaries, and which will afford assurance to all peoples thatthey may live out their lives in freedom from fear.Sixth, they desire such a peace to establish for all safety on the high seasand oceans.Seventh, they believe that all of the nations of the world must be guidedin spirit to the abandonment of the use of force. Because no future peace canbe maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, to use force outside of their frontiers, they believe that the disarmament of such nations is essential. They will further theadoption of all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace-lovingpeoples the crushing burden of armaments.Annex II.JOINT DECLARATION BY THE PRESIDENT AND THEPRIME MINISTER.August 12, 1941.THE President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister,Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,being met together, deem it right to make known certain common principles inthe national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopesfor a better future for the world.
Annex III.BRITISH-AMERICAN CHIEFS OF STAFF DISCUSSIONS.THE following is a summary of the ground covered by the Chiefs of Staffdiscussions with the Americans : General Points.2. During the three days at Placentia Bay, three joint and a number of individual discussions were held between the First Sea Lord, C.I.G.S., andV.C.A.S. on our side, and Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations,Admiral King, C.-in-C, Atlantic Fleet, Rear-Admiral Turner, Chief of NavalWar Plans, General Marshall, Chief of Staff, and Major-General Arnold, army air Corps, on the American side.* The text of the Joint Declaration was subsequently agreed by telephone with HisMajesty&apos;s Embassy at Washington (Telegram 3798 from Washington) and a number ofalterations made. These were all verbal, except the omission of the word &quot; more &quot; in line 5 ofparagraph 8.First, their countries seek no aggrandisement, territorial or other.Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with thefreely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned.Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live, and they wish to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them.Fourth, they will endeavour, with due respect for their existing obligations,to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world whichare needed for their economic prosperity.Fifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing for all improved labour standards,economic advancement and social security.Sixth, after the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, they hope to seeestablished a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling insafety within their own boundaries, and which will, afford assurance that all themen in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want.Seventh, such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas andoceans without hindrance.Eighth, they believe that all of the nations of the world, for realistic as wellas spiritual reasons, must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since nofuture peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to beemployed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside oftheir frontiers, they believe, pending the establishment of a wider and more permanent system of general security, that the disarmament of such nations isessential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measureswhich will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments.^
3. The discussions were conducted in a frank and friendly atmosphere. the americans, while ready to listen to our point of view, took every opportunity ofimpressing upon us the many problems and difficulties which confronted them.These may be summarised as follows :- (i) America is as yet far from being prepared for active operations on awar footing. While the American Navy is in a more advanced stateof readiness, the building up, training and equipping of the american army and air corps is still in embryo and the shortage of equipment is acute.(li) American public opinion, as well as their Chiefs of Staff, will insist upon a considerable measure of new equipment being allotted to their new army and air forces.(iii) Subject to (i) and (ii) above, the Americans will in time give us muchmaterial.(iv) We are not, however, the only claimants.   The Russian demands and,to a lesser degree, the demands of other friends, e.g., China, cannotbe set aside.Strategical Discussions.4. In their present non-belligerent state the American Chiefs of Staff are primarily concerned with questions of supply and organisation. They have,however, taken away with them, and will shortly comment on, a Review of generalstrategy which we had prepared for them. We think that their main commentwill be that we attach too much importance to the bombing offensive and thatwe have given the production of heavy bombers an unduly high priority. we found that they had only vague ideas as to the employment of their forces if they came into the war.5. ! We were successful in convincing the Americans of the correctness of our policy to fight in the Middle East. Nevertheless, in accepting this policy assound, the Americans felt that we should not over-allot equipment to the middle east at the expense of other vital theatres. The quantities of equipment available from the United States would be limited by (a) shipping, and (b) the rival claims of the United States rearmament and of other countries besides ourselves.Consequently, they think that we should be careful not to embark on a majorextension of our effort in the Middle East which it might be impossible to sustain.Atlantic Islands.6. (i) The President favours operation &quot;Pilgrim&quot; either in anticipation of, or after, a German move.(ii) The President has interpreted a communication which he received fromDr. Salazar as meaning that, if the Germans move into the Iberian Peninsula,the Portuguese Government would make a token resistance in Portugal and thentransfer to the Azores. On the assumption that we were too pre-occupiedelsewhere, they would then be prepared to accept American protection for these
Islands. The President has said that he is prepared for American forces to look after the Azores, if invited to do so, and that the necessary forces could be readyto move at fairly short notice, i.e., in about three weeks.(iii) The Cape de Verde Islands are our responsibility.(iv) The Americans would like us to leave sufficient of our troops in Iceland(C) to enable the United States Marine Brigade to be withdrawn and held in readiness for operations elsewhere. On the other hand we, who are fighting, are anxious to release all our troops from Iceland (C) so as to avoid divided controland to free them for use elsewhere.(Note. The Americans make the point that Iceland (C) and the Azores aretechnically within the Western Hemisphere : the Cape de VerdeIslands and the Canaries are not.)North and West Africa.7. The Americans think that the Germans can, and will, move down throughSpain to North and West Africa whenever they wish. The Americans have onlymade a preliminary study of possible operations against Dakar, and they willhave no forces available for many months.Staff studies, which we had prepared on possible operations in Morocco and against Dakar, were given to the Americans.South America.8. The Americans showed concern, to an extent which we had not previouslyrealised, at the possibility of Axis penetration into South American countries,particularly Brazil, in most of which active German organizations already exist.They are holding forces in readiness to occupy key points in South Americaand are negotiating with Brazil for a leased base.Far East.9. American Military planning is at present concerned almost entirely withthe Western Hemisphere. Discussions about the Far East were, therefore, mainly confined to the naval aspect. The defences of the Philippines are weak, e.g., theA.A. defences of Manila have recently been increased from 2 to 4 guns. a squadron of flying fortresses (9 aircraft) and a few tanks have been sent there.The Americans have, we think, rather exaggerated hopes of the effect of opera-tions, particularly air, from the Philippines against a Japanese expedition tothe South China Sea.Production and Equipment.10. As explained above, the American Chiefs of Staff are very naturallyobsessed with the shortage of equipment for their new forces. They are muchexercised to arrive at a correct order of priority for our requirements and a fairallocation of new production.
11. They complain about our present methods of stating our requirements.They say that the Joint Staff Mission and the British purchasing commissions,do not work hand in glove. As a result, the American authorities receive requests for material through more than one channel and these often conflict. Further-more, they are not given a clear indication of the relative importance of therequirements of each Service, nor are the items on any one list given an orderof priority.12. The United States Chiefs of Staff consider that the allocation of warmaterial between the various claimants should be done on the basis of strategicalrequirements. They think that our lists should come to them through the joint staff Mission, with whom there could be free and frank discussion of the military grounds for our demands, which could be weighed up along with their own andthose of other friendly countries and an agreed allocation made. They would prefer this as an alternative to the present arrangement whereby they receivedemands through civilian organizations who are not in a position to state themilitary case.13. We are in sympathy with the views of the United States Chiefs of Staffin this matter, particularly as, to an increasing degree, our supplies of Americanequipment will be under lease-lend arrangements and not from our own contracts.We earnestly hope that our machinery can be adjusted to fit in with their methods,as otherwise we do not feel that we shall get sympathetic consideration for ourdemands.14. It is possible that a solution to this problem would be to appoint a prominent man as head of our Mission in the United States with the virtual status of a Minister of State. Under him the Joint Staff Mission would be responsiblefor discussing strategy and for putting forward our proposals for the allocation of war equipment; while a civil staff would be responsible for dealing with thesupply of raw materials, food, shipping, &amp;c.Naval Points.15. (i) Plan No. 4. This is referred to in the Prime Ministers report.(ii) A.B.C. 1. This is a report of the British-American Conference held in washington in January 1941 and is looked upon by the Americans as their Bible.A number of minor points came to light during the discussion and were adjusted.(iii) A .B.D. Report. This is the report of the American, British and DutchConference at Singapore. The American Chiefs of Staff had previously expressed their disagreement with certain points, and these were cleared up in discussionwith the exception of the initial dispositions of British Naval forces, and a freshdocument is being prepared for the concurrence of the Americans.Army Points.16. (i) The army discussions took the form of a general exchange ofinformation.
(ii) The Americans aim at a first expansion programme amounting to atotal, including.army air arm, of about 1,700,000 men to provide primarily forthe needs of home defence, garrisons, overseas and forces to support Canada; alsoto occupy strategic points in South America to protect the Panama Canal. Theprogramme allows for 35 Divisions in all, including 6 armoured Divisions.Two Marine Divisions, well trained and equipped, are the only forces ready forwar at the present time.(iii) Equipment and trained personnel for the new formations are stilllacking, and there is a grave ammunition shortage, particularly of 37mm.,-50-inch and -30-inch.  No jump in production is likely before November.(iv) The President has released a further 150,000. -30-inch rifles to us.Additional - 30-inch ammunition could be rushed over if signs of invasion become evident.(v) The Americans propose to release to us 760 light and 700 medium tanksbetween now and the end of December. They also hope to give us a number ofGarand semi-automatic rifles.Air Points.17. (i) The discussions were mainly about the production and allocation of heavy bombers. It became evident, although they did not state this officially,that the Americans do not intend to ratify the agreement arrived at duringthe United States-British Staff conversations, under which the major part of theAmerican heavy bomber production was to be allocated to the United Kingdom.All that we can definitely count on between now and June 1943 is some 1,100aircraft out of a total production of about 4,600, whereas we require during thisperiod some 6,000 heavy bombers in addition to British production.(ii) Mr. Harriman and. Major-General Arnold are examining the possibilityof turning over capacity at present allocated to the production of medium bombers to producing heavy bombers, but. this would not necessarily mean an increasedallocation to us.(iii) The various forms of technical assistance which we should like were discussed, and also the question of the ferrying of aircraft across the North a,ndSouth Atlantic by the United States. In general the Americans appeared willingto afford us the assistance we asked for, particularly in the Middle East, AnOfficer is being sent forthwith to consult on the spot with the A.O.C.-in-C,,Middle East.Summary.18. To sum up,, we neither expected nor achieved startling results. TheAmerican Chiefs of Staff are quite clearly thinking in terms of the defence ofthe Western Hemisphere and have so far not formulated any joint strategy forthe defeat of Germany in the event of their entry into the war. Nevertheless, the personal contacts with our American colleagues will .prove of the greatest value for our future collaboration.   We have, we think, convinced the Americans thats
our policy in the Middle East is sound. They, in turn, have made us understandtheir difficulties. A most distressing revelation is the reduction in heavy bomber and Catalina allocation to us. This we consider a serious matter. We are also concerned at the small number of Catalinas allocated to the United kingdom during the next few months.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.J. G. DILL.W. R. FREEMAN, V.C.A.S.H.M.S. Prince of Wales, August 15, 1941.Annex IV.I SAILED from Scapa on Monday, the 4th August, in H.M.S. Prince of wales (Captain J. C.

Nutting, M.C.,Military Assistant to the C.I.G.S.; and Group Captain W. M. Yool, C.B.E., StaffOfficer to the Vice-Chief of Air Staff.2. H.M.S. Prince of Wales arrived at our rendezvous with the flagshipof the President of the United States ([J.S.S. Augusta) in Placentia Bay,Newfoundland, at 9 a.m. on Saturday, the 9th August. As soon as the customarynaval courtesies had been exchanged, I went aboard the U.S.S. Augusta andgreeted President Roosevelt, handing him a letter from His Majesty The king and presenting the members of my party. Conversations were then begunbetween the President and myself, Mr. Sumner Welles and Sir alexander cadogan and the staff officers on both sides, which proceeded more or lesscontinuously for the remaining days of our visit, sometimes tete-a-tete and sometimes in larger conferences.
3. On Sunday morning, the 10th August, Mr. Roosevelt came aboardH.M.S. Prince of Wales and, with his staff officers and several hundredrepresentatives of all ranks of the United States Navy and Marines, attendedDivine Service on the quarterdeck, conducted by the ship&apos;s chaplain, ixev.W. G. Parker, and Rev. R. W. Shrum, Chaplain, United States Navy. this service was felt by us all to be a deeply moving expression of the unity of faithof our two peoples, and none who saw it will forget the spectacle presented thatsunlit morning on the crowded quarterdeck the symbolism of the Union Jackand the Stars and Stripes draped side by side on the pulpit; the american and British chaplains sharing in the reading of the prayers; the highest navaland military officers of Britain and the United States grouped in one bodybehind the President and myself; the close packed ranks of British and Americansailors, completely intermingled, sharing the same books and joining heartilytogether in the prayers and hymns familiar to both.4. The President remained for a luncheon party to which I had invitedsome 30 British and American guests. Afterwards short but cordial speecheswere made by Mr. Roosevelt and myself.5. Our conferences continued throughout Sunday and Monday. OnMonday afternoon I telegraphed to the Lord Privy Seal, for consideration bythe Cabinet, the draft of the Joint Declaration further described in my mainreport. The remarkable speed with which my colleagues considered this telegram(at a midnight session) and telegraphed their comments enabled me to come to a final agreement with the President on Tuesday morning, the 12th August, and to takeleave of him and sail for Iceland, on my way home, that afternoon. The voyagewas uneventful, although at one point it became necessary to alter course owingto the reported presence of U-Boats in the vicinity. On this portion of the journey our escort included two United States destroyers, in one of which wasEnsign Eranklin D. Roosevelt, Jnr., the Presidents son, who acted as liaison officer during our visit to Iceland.6. H.M.S. Prince of Wales reached the island on Saturday morning, the16th August, and anchored at Hvals Fiord, from which we travelled to Reykjavikin a destroyer. On arrival at the port, I received a remarkably warm andvociferous welcome from a large crowd, whose friendly greetings were repeatedwhenever our presence was recognised during our stay, culminating in scenes ofgreat enthusiasm on our departure in the afternoon, to the accompaniment of suchcheers and hand-clapping as have, I was assured, seldom been heard in the streetsof Reykjavik.7. I was greeted on the quay by His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Mr. C. HowardSmith, C.M.G., the General Officer Commanding Iceland Force, Major-GeneralH. O. Curtis, C.B., D.S.O., M.C., and other British and American Officers. after a short visit to the Althinghaus, to pay my respects to the Regent and themembers of the Icelandic Cabinet, I proceeded to inspect a joint review of the
British and American Forces. I took the salute with the President&apos;s son standingbeside me, and the parade provided another remarkable demonstration of anglo-American solidarity.8. On return to Hvals Fiord, I visited H.M.S. Ramillies (and addressedrepresentatives of the crews of the British and American ships in the anchorage),H.M.S. Hecla and H.M.S. Churchill. H.M.S. Prince of Wales sailed fromIceland that evening, and reached Scapa on Monday morning, the 18th August.I arrived back in London on the following day.w. s.. c,
