naval SITUATION.General Review.1. In spite of a concentrated attack on a home-bound convoy, shipping losses are still below the average.Reinforcements and stores have arrived at Malta.Home Waters.2. On the 3rd an aircraft catapulted from H.M.S. Maplin shot down aFocke-Wulf aircraft which was shadowing a convoy 500 miles west of Land&apos;s End.H.M. Trawler Norland shot down an enemy bomber off the Suffolk coast onthe 4th.During heavy weather off the Norfolk coast, on the 6th, six ships of a coastalconvoy and an escorting trawler went ashore and all but one, a total of 8,757 tons,are believed to be a total loss.The Longstone Lighthouse has been seriously damaged by two direct hitsfrom aircraft.Mediterranean.3. A force of cruisers and destroyers delivered reinforcements and storesat Malta on the 2nd August. While this operation was in progress the mainGibraltar force proceeded to the westward of Sardinia. H.M. Destroyer Maoribombarded the seaplane slipway and buildings at Porto Comte, Sardinia, and h.M. Destroyer Cossack entered the roadstead of Alghero but found no shipping.Naval aircraft attacked the aerodrome.BZ.M. Submarines Upholder and Utmost and the Netherlands Submarine0. 21 have each sunk a large enemy merchant vessel in the Central Mediterranean.H.M. Submarines Utmost and Unique have made successful forays on railway communications in Southern Italy.H.M. Submarine Cachalot is considerably overdue and must be presumed lost; the Italians claim to have rammed and sunk her and taken the crewprisoner.4. During the week 9 French merchant ships (21,000 tons) have passed gibraltar in convoy westbound and 7 (14,000 tons) eastbound.Anti-Submarine Operations.5. H.M.S. Hermione rammed a U-boat in the Sicilian Channel on the2nd August.U-Boats attacking a homebound convoy west of Ireland have been continuously counter-attacked. On the afternoon of the 3rd AugustH.M. Destroyer Wanderer and the Norwegian Destroyer St. Albans made a promising attack, later the same evening a U-boat surfaced in approximately the same position and was probably destroyed by H.M. Corvettes Hydrangea andCampanula. Three attacks were made by covering aircraft on the 4th, two ofwhich may have obtained hits. On the 5th an attack by ELM. Corvette Zinniaand gunfire from the convoy probably accounted for another U-boat.Six other attacks were made without visible result, one by surface craft offthe Hebrides and five by aircraft. Of the latter, two were off Usfhant and the others off the Straits of Gibraltar, West Ireland and the Naze.Enemy Intelligence.German.6. The positions of the German main units have not materially altered inthe past week except that Tirpitz, which had left the floating dock at Kiel, hasnow been seen berthed at the entrance to the Inner Dockyard Basin.   It is
believed that this battleship may be ready within a month. The battlecruisersand Prinz Eugen now at Brest are at present all in dry dock.Four or five destroyers and three or four submarines are still in NorthernNorwegian waters, though they may have altered their stations since the recentBritish operations in those waters.Italian.7.   The two Littorio class battleships and one Cavour are still at Taranto.U-boats.8. About twenty-five German U-boats are operating off the seaboard of western Europe and six or seven Italians off the Straits of Gibraltar. one german U-boat is working in the Cape Verde area.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.9. There have been eight attacks by enemy aircraft on convoys and shipping on the East Coast during the week; one ship was sunk off Blyth and others damaged.A homeward bound convoy from Sierra Leone has been subjected to sustainedU-boat and aircraft attacks to the West of Ireland, and six ships have been sunk.In an enemy air attack on Suez on the night 3rd /4th August, one British andone Belgian tanker were torpedoed and a small Belgian ship was torpedoed and sunk.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending 6th August, 981 ships, including 167 allied and 21 neutral, were convoyed. Four anti-aircraft ships, 13 armed merchant cruisers, 56 destroyers and 97 sloops, corvettes and fleet minesweepers were employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the2nd August were 1,177,422 tons compared with. 615,475 tons in the previous weekand an average of 887,937 tons for the past ten weeks. Oil imports amounted to427,875 tons, compared with 177,247 tons during the preceding seven days.Mineral imports were 260,452 tons, of which 174,611 tons were steel, scrap iron,pig iron and iron ore. Timber and pulp imports were 44,131 tons. Cereal imports were 223,477 tons. Other food imports amounted to 153,442 tons, of which 65,315tons were sugar and molasses. Other food-stuffs included tinned and refrigeratedmeat, bacon and hams, 20,254 tons, cheese 5,782 tons, tea 3,078 tons, cocoa 2,852tons, butter 1,453 tons and dried fruit 917 tons. There were also a large quantityof unspecified tinned foods. Two consignments of wine from Lisbon amounted to590 tons; there were 283 tons of rum from the West Indies and 2,802 of tobacco.There were large quantities of war stores, aircraft and aircraft parts, lorriesmachinery, including 1,134 tons of machine tools.British Minelaying.11. M.T.B.s laid 8 mines off the Belgian coast. Minelaying by aircraft hasbeen on a very small scale and confined to the Western Baltic.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.12. Enemy minelaying aircraft have not been very active round our coastsduring the past week, and there were no casualties due to mines.Eight magnetic mines and two acoustic mines have been swept during theweek, including one magnetic swept at Tobruk. The totals now are : magnetic1,316, acoustic 914, contact mines 1,021.[22795] b
Foreign Stations.13. The Suez Canal has been raided twice during the past week, but was closed to traffic only temporarily.The report of minesweeping in Alexandria for the three months ending the31st July shows that 63 mines were accounted for, 25 of which fell on land.There were 14 minelaying raids during this period. Only one shipping casualtyoccurred.Enemy Merchant Shipping.14. The Frankfurt (5,522 tons), which sailed from Rio de Janeiro on the27th June, was intercepted by H.M.S. Carina (Ocean boarding vessel) about540 miles south-south-west of the Azores on the 4th August. She was scuttledand sank.   Twenty-six of the crew were taken prisoner, twenty are missing.It has been reported that on the 25th July the following ships were at Genoa :the Roma (30,631 tons) in dry dock, the Augustus (30,418 tons) alongside, and theVirgilio (6,750 tons) and a ship thought to be the Oceania (19,507 tons), both ofwhich were undergoing repairs for bomb damage.The Capo Arma (3,175 tons) sailed from Istanbul for the JEge&amp;n on the2nd August, and on the 7th August Reuter quoted a report that she had been sunk by a British submarine in the iEgean.   This has not yet been confirmed.The sinking of the Ernani (4,113 tons) has been confirmed. The Spanish pressstates that she was sunk by a British submarine, and the Greek Legation in madrid has confirmed her loss.Intelligence.Russian.15. The following claims have been made as to enemy losses in northern waters  On the 15th July a transport (4,000 tons) was torpedoed by submarine offHonningsvag (North Norway). In addition a minesweeper was sunk by a submarine to the westward of North Cape (Norway), and an enemy submarine was sunk by a destroyer in the northern approaches to the White Sea.Far Eastern.16. The Japanese Combined Fleet was last reported in the Van DiemenStraits (under the southernmost point of Japan) on the 16th July. It is believed to be based on Ariake Bay in the south-east of Kyushu. The naval forces nowin Indo-Chinese waters are the normal South China Fleet with an additionalDestroyer Flotilla and the Local Defence Flotilla from Bako, Pescadores. TheSouth China Fleet consists of 1 8-inch cruiser, Ashigara, 2 small 5-5-inch cruisers and 2 Flotillas of Destroyers.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is included inthis Resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.17. Although the Germans still hold the initiative and have made some progress, notably in the Ukraine sector and to a lesser extent in their thrusttowards Leningrad, the Russians are resisting strongly and show no signs ofcollapse.Finland.18. In the Lake Ladoga area the threat to the Murmansk railway in thedirection of Petrozavodsk southwards has made some headway against strong opposition.
Baltic Front.19. No advance seems to have been made in the Luga area, which wasreached about a fortnight ago, but the German line north-east of Lake Peipushas been advanced to within some 50 miles of Leningrad. It is probable that russian troops in Northern Estonia will retire eastwards to avoid being cut off,leaving a garrison to hold Tallinn.20. German attacks eastwards across the main Leningrad-Nevel railwayhave made progress, and two considerable salients have been formed east of Dnoand Opochka respectively. The German official news agency claims the capture of Kholm.White Russia.21. Heavy fighting has continued in the Smolensk area, where strongRussian counter-attacks against the apex of the salient have made Germanprogress extremely slow. The Germans are still between 180 and 200 miles from moscow. Their main effort now seems to have been transferred from this sectorto the Ukraine.Ukraine.22. After their first thrust on Kiev had proved unsuccessful, the Germanslaunched an attack south-eastwards between the Dnieper and the Dniester. Theyhave advanced in this direction beyond Uman, although pockets of russian resistance doubtless exist behind the advanced German elements.23. A serious threat is developing to the Kiev-Odessa railway, and theRussians are withdrawing eastwards from the lower reaches of the Dniester toavoid being cut off by the drive from the north-west.Casualties.24. A conservative estimate of German casualties up to the 1st August,based on information from various sources, is 750,000.Reactions in Germany.25. There is abundant evidence to show that the German High Commandhas been surprised and considerably troubled by the degree of Russian resistance.It may be significant of German expectations with regard to the duration of theRussian campaign that the opening of the autumn fair at Konigsberg has been postponed from the 17th August to the 12th October. In any case, the Germantime-table for the campaign has certainly been upset.Operations.Libya Tobruk.26. Further successful patrolling has been carried out by our troops. Onthe 28th and the 29th July, a strong fighting patrol attacked a large party ofItalians, causing them to disperse and enabling our forces to occupy their position.A abyssinia.27. An attack on our troops on the 2nd August in the Wolchefit area wasrepulsed and our counter-attack drove the enemy from high ground, killing26 Italians and taking 13 prisoners.   Our casualties were slight.Intelligence.Spain.28. There appears to be some increase of military activity in SouthernSpain, Spanish Morocco and the Canaries. Four heavy guns have recently been shipped to Ceuta (Spanish Morocco) and changes are being made in the dispositions of Coast Defence batteries.  There is evidence that petrol dumps are[22795] b 2
being assembled at various points in Spanish. Morocco pending the completionof underground stores, and that stocks of essential foodstuffs are beingaccumulated.29. It is also reported that considerable quantities of ammunition, harbourdefence gear and other war material are being shipped from the Balearic Islandsto the mainland. Spanish Morocco and the Canaries.Yugoslavia.30. Guerilla activity in Yugoslavia is increasing and many reports havebeen received lately of attacks on sentries and small garrisons, of acts of sabotageand of raids from the hills. Outbreaks have been most frequent in Montenegro,where the Italian garrison has had to summon reinforcements.31. There are at present some thirteen Italian divisions in Montenegro,Croatia and the puppet province of Ljubljana, one German division centred in belgrade, and Hungarian troops in the Banat. These troops were thoughtadequate to maintain order, but such is the spirit of the Montenegrans and theSerbs that it is possible that the Italian garrison will have to be reinforced.Bulgaria.32. There is no news of any unusual military activity, though the armyremains fully mobilized. There are probably not more than seven or eightdivisions on the Turkish frontier. Reports suggest that, so far from adding tothis concentration, recent moves have tended to be towards the Black Sea coastalarea rather than the Turkish land frontier.Far East.33., During the last week, whilst the Japanese army has been occupyingsea and air bases of Southern Indo-China, military preparations of a considerable scale have been taking place in Manchukuo. It has been reported that 500,000reservists have recently been called up in Japan and that the majority of these have been sent to Korea and Manchukuo. It is also reported that a further200,000 men of older category are in process of being called up for lines of communications duties.34. The present distribution of Japanese Divisions is believed to be asfollows :- Divisions.Manchukuo and North Korea ... ... ... 15Sakhalin   ...      ...      ..*. ... ... ... 2Japan       ...       ...       ... ... ... ... north China       ............... 7Central China     ...       ... ... ... ... 10South China and Hainan ... ... ... 4Formosa   ...      ...      ... ... ... ... 3Inclo-China         ...       ... ... ... ... air SITUATION.General Review.35. The Royal Air Force continued its attacks on industrial and com-munication targets in Germany and in Occupied Territory, in spite of unfavour-able weather. Successful attacks were also made on shipping in Home waters and in the Mediterranean.Enemy activity over this country.was on a small scale.Germany and Occupied Territory.Bay.36. Bomber Command despatched 103 sorties, compared with 206 last week,and dropped 19 tons of H.E. bombs by day. Fighter Command flew sortiesinvolving 1,352 aircraft.
37. On the 2nd August, in good weather, a Fortress bomber attacked Kielfrom a height of 32,500 feet, dropping four 1,100 lb. bombs on the southern endof the town, where the main railway line enters the dock area. Another Fortressattacked Borkum, but results could not be observed because of cloud. On the same day three Blenheims destroyed a gun emplacement on Ameland.38. Aircraft of Fighter Command carried out many offensive operations against objectives in Northern France. Whirlwinds, operating in pairs andescorted by Spitfires, scored hits on aircraft on the ground at Querqueville andMaupertus aerodromes, near Cherbourg, on oil tanks, barrack huts, troops and motor transport near the aerodromes, and on wireless stations at Querqueville andCap de la Hague.39. Spitfires and Hurricanes also attacked targets in Northern France.Goods trains near Boulogne, St. Omer, Le Treport and Abbeville, factories at st.. Omer and near Berck, military barracks at Le Crotoy and Abbeville, troopformations near Hazebrouck, and aircraft on the ground at Berck and Samerwere all raked with machine gun and cannon fire.40.   Attacks on enemy shipping are reported under Coastal Operations.41.   Enemy defensive fighter patrols over the French Coast operated on asmall scale only.Night.42. Bomber Command despatched 736 sorties by night, as compared with454 in the previous week Operations were carried out on four nights only, the programmes for the remaining three being cancelled because of unfavourable weather. The principal targets were the industrial and railway centres of Berlin,Hamburg, Frankfort, Karlsruhe, Mannheim and Ludwigshafen, the shipyards atKiel and the docks at Calais and Cherbourg. Over 700 tons of H.E. bombs,including several of the heaviest type, and 70,000 incendiaries were dropped onthese and other enemy targets.43. Berlin was attacked on the night 2nd/3rd August by thirty-six aircraft,including eight Halifaxes and three Stiiiings. Visibility was poor because of ground haze, but four 4,000-lb. bombs were seen to burst, two near the AirMinistry, causing terrific explosions followed by large fires. Other bombs fellnear the Friedrichstrasse and Tempelhof railway stations and in the Steglitzarea.44. Frankfort was bombed on three nights of the week by a total of 121aircraft. On two nights observation was hampered by cloud, but several fires were seen, including a very large one near &quot;the main railway station. AtMannheim, which was bombed on two nights, a 4,000-lb. bomb was seen to burstbetween the main railway station and the river, causing a huge explosionfollowed by a blinding flash and a shower of sparks. Other big explosions were seen at the southern end of the Chemical works at Ludwigshafen, on the oppositebank of the river, and in the dock area. At Karlsruhe, which was also attacked on two nights, several bombs, including two of the largest type, fell in the townand in the railway centre; many large fires were started, two of enormous size.45. At Hamburg, bombs fell on the railway centre and in the dock area;at Kiel bursts were observed in the shipyards and on warehouses, and at Hanover,after two 4,000-lb. bombs had fallen on the main railway station, all searchlightand A.A. activity over a wide area ceased for five minutes. The docks at Calaisand Cherbourg were also successfully attacked, bombs falling on dock buildings at the former and on the quays of the tidal and No. 6 Basins at the latter.46. The night defensive fighters of the enemy operated on a reduced scaleduring the week.United Kingdom.47. Fighter Command flew 940 patrols, involving 2,230 sorties, by day,and 216 patrols, involving 322 sorties, by night; the latter totals include duskand dawn operations. The total sorties, which include the operations mentionedin paragraphs 36, 38, 39, 50 and 53, were somewhat fewer than.those of last week.
48. Enemy activity remained at a low level, and during daylight only10 aircraft were plotted overland. The remainder, totalling about 150, were engaged in weather and shipping reconnaissance nights round the coast. our fighters destroyed three of the latter and damaged a fourth.49. At night shipping, and the coastal districts were the principal objectives,and though some bombs were dropped inland no attacks developed against anyparticular target. The total enemy effort at night was approximately 180 aircraft of which 65 were night fighters which operated over our bomber aerodromes, butmet with no success. Two enemy aircraft were destroyed at night during theweek.Coastal Operations.50. Coastal Command flew 250 patrols (362 sorties) and provided escortsfor 79 convoys (257 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols carried outby Fighter Command totalled 667 (1,385 sorties).51. In spite of unfavourable weather on most days of the week, aircraft of bomber, Fighter and Coastal Commands made several successful attacks on enemy shipping. On the 1st August, three Blenheims attacked two merchantvessels of 1,500 and 500 tons off the Belgian Coast. Bombs straddled both ships,and the larger was seen to be burning and in a sinking condition. On the 2nd,three Blenheims sank a patrol vessel of 2,000 tons west of Den Helder and aBeaufort torpedoed a laden tanker of 2,000 tons off Ostend. The vessel burstinto flames and three minutes later it was seen to be sinking rapidly.52. On the 5th, three Blenheims, in a low level attack, registered two hitson a medium-sized merchant vessel off the Hook of Holland. Three otherBlenheims scored hits on three reporting vessels north of Borkum. All threevessels were destroyed. On the following clay, a Beaufort scored hits on the bowand stern of a large supply ship in the port of Nantes, and Blenheims bombeda small convoy, escorted by a destroyer, off the coast of Holland. After the attackone of the ships was seen to be down by the stern with smoke pouring from it.On the night 6th/7th, a Beaufort torpedoed amidships a medium-sized merchant vessel off the Alsboen Light.53. Aircraft of Fighter Command were also active against shipping offthe French Coast. Hurricanes attacked &quot; E &quot; and &quot; E,&apos;&apos; Boats, a naval escort vessel, and several small merchant vessels, motor launches and mine sweepers,most of which were hit. Attacks were also made by Whirlwinds on other &quot; E &quot;Boats, one of which was left in a sinking condition, and on two tankers offCherbourg, from one of which smoke was issuing when it was last seen.54. Ten aircraft laid mines in Kiel Harbour, Langeland Belt, Little Beltand Flensburg Fiord.55. No minelaying by enemy aircraft was reported during the week. Eightenemy attacks were made on shipping off the East Coast and are referred to inthe Naval Section.Central Mediterranean.56. Blenheims and Beaufighters from Malta continued their offensive against enemy shipping and aerodromes. A ship of about 8,000 tons in Tripoli(L) harbour received a hit which was followed by a violent explosion, and a ship of about 5,000 tons alongside was set on fire. During this attack two hits weremade on a building believed to be Air Headquarters. Two ships in Lampedusaharbour were also hit, and a schooner of about 800 tons was sunk off Misurata. a convoy consisting of 6 merchant ships and 6 destroyers was attacked offLampedusa by 7 Naval Swordfish from Malta. Two ships (8,000 and 6,000 tons)were sunk and, on the following morning, 8 Blenheims hit two similar ships, pro-bably sinking one and severely damaging the other. It is possible that a destroyerwas also damaged.
57. Beaufighters attacked the aerodromes at Borizzo, Sicily, and ReggioCalabria, Southern Italy, destroying two bombers and about ten fighters, and damaging many others. Naval Swordfish obtained ten direct hits on thesubmarine base at Augusta, Sicily, on the night 5th/6th. Large fires were causedon the submarine jetty. Our reconnaissance aircraft have maintained a constantwatch on enemy shipping and aerodromes, and in the course of their patrols havebombed Messina, where a cruiser was narrowly missed, and machine-gunnedenemy bombers at Zuara, destroying one and severely damaging at least threeothers.58. The enemy have shown no inclination to approach Malta by day, butfour night attacks were made, though no serious damage resulted. On the night5th / 6th August three of the ten raiders were destroyed by Hurricanes, and on thefollowing night, when three aircraft approached the Island, one of them was shot down.Egypt and Cyrenaica.59. During the week under review, our bombers made two successful day-light raids. On the 1st August, nine Blenheims, escorted by Hurricanes, attacked a concentration of enemy M.T. vehicles at Sidi Omar and inflicted severe damage and, on the 3rd, twenty-one mary lands bombed enemy gun positions in the Tobrukarea, while our fighters carried out a covering sweep over enemy forward aero-dromes. In neither of these operations did we suffer any casualties. Our fightersmaintained patrols over our coastal shipping and, on the 2nd, broke up a heavyenemy dive bombing attack on a convoy off the Libyan coast, destroying at least three Ju. 87s and one or more Me. 109s, with the loss of three Hurricanes.60. Heavy night attacks have been maintained by Wellingtons against the harbours of Benghazi and Derna and many fires and heavy explosions were observed. Other targets successfully attacked at night by Wellingtons, Blenheimsand mary lands include repair shops at Derna and Bardia, and enemy landing grounds at Gazala. Martuba and El Tmimi. Shipping off Apollonia was also attacked and two merchant ships probably hit. Mines were also laid off Benghazi.From a total of 100 night sorties our losses were one Wellington and oneMaryland.61. The enemy have made several daylight attacks on Tobruk, on one occasiondamaging a jetty and an oil refuelling line. Three night raids were made onPort Said and the Suez Canal area by formations of ten, twenty and thirtybombers respectively, some of which, at least, operated from the Piraeus. Noservice property was seriously damaged ashore. Casualties at Ismailia included96 civilians and 4 service personnel killed and, at Suez, a fire broke out at an oil storage cistern but was brought under control.East Africa,62. Bombing and machine-gun attacks were maintained against enemy positions at Wolchefit and Debarech in the Gondar area, and Gondar itself was bombed on five occasions. Aircraft of the South African and Free French AirForces assisted the Royal Air Force in these operations. A few Italian fighters were encountered, one of which was damaged by one of our reconnaissance aircraft.j*aegean.63. After a photographic reconnaissance of Crete, Melos and the Piraeus on the 1st August, seven Wellingtons bombed the aerodromes at Heraklion andMaleme, in Crete, on the following night, and explosions and fires which broke out in the dispersal areas point to destruction of aircraft and stores. On the night 4th/5th August, an enemy aircraft bombed the Nicosia district of Cypruswithout causing damage or casualties.
Russia.64. There is again little detailed information of the air situation on theRussian battlefront, Since the German advance into Esthonia, raids on Helsinkiand Southern Finland have decreased considerably, and the Russian bombereffort in that sector appears to have been concentrated against troops betweenNarva and Lake Peipus. Elsewhere, the Russian Air Force is continuing itsco-operation with the army. There have been reports of dive-bombing attacks by russian fighters carrying single bombs.65. There have been no developments of importance in the Russian campaignduring the past week in operations by the German Air Force, except such as mayhave accompanied the drives by the army in the direction of Kiev and Odessa.The German effort against Moscow has shown a marked decline.66. There has been a reinforcement by some German long-range bombers to the extreme north of Norway and Finland. This may be connected withheavier attacks on the Russians in the Murmansk area and with the recent british naval operations in the Arctic Ocean. The German Air Force is making use ofthe Finnish aerodromes at Petsamo, Rovaniemi and Helsinki.67. While the exact measure of assistance given to Germany by the combined air forces of those countries participating in the Russian campaignremains obscure, there is every reason to suppose that it is very slight. Hungarianand Roumanian aircraft, however, have been active in their respective sectors of the front. On the 16th July, it was announced in the Italian press that a reconnaissance regiment of the Croatian Air Force (a body which seems to havebeen formed from remnants of the Jugoslav Air Force) had left Zagreb for germany. In Spain unexpected obstacles appear to have arisen, for of the 120fighter pilots and 380 ground personnel who were to have left Madrid for germany on the 24th July, only 12 pilots and 50 mechanics ultimately left therailway-station. The Danes are finding difficulty in providing their quota of volunteers.Air Intelligence.German Air Force.68. K.G. 40 (the Condor Unit), which to-day has an establishment of27 F.W. 200s. and 9 He. Ills., is being expanded to a strength of 3 Gruppen(90 aircraft), probably with the object of undertaking general anti-shippingactivities. The expansion of this Unit is at the expense wholly or in part of another long-range bomber unit. The equipment of the new Gruppen is not known, but it is thought likely that they will be equipped at least in part with anew type, possibly the Do. 217, a twin-engined bomber of which reliable details are lacking.French Air Force.69. Many of the units which operated in Syria have now returned to theirbases in North Africa and unoccupied France, bringing the estimated first-line strength of the French Air Force in France and French North and West africa to a total of 837 aircraft.With the conclusion of operations in Syria it is possible for the first time toform some impression of the probable operational strength of the French AirForce in other theatres. A better developed ground organisation in North africa and a less well developed ground organisation in West Africa make it likely thatthe resistance offered to an attack in the one area would be greater and in theother smaller than in the Levant. Certain features of the Syrian campaign are,none the less, liable to recur in future French defensive operations.Indo-China.70. An official Japanese statement made in Saigon on the 4th Augustclaimed that the occupation of the ceded bases had been completed. Although upto the 31st July only 20 fighters and 40 bombers, the latter mostly heavy bombers,had been reported on these bases, sufficient aircraft are available in South Chinato make full use of the available accommodation.
As it now appears clear that the Tan Son Nhut aerodrome at Saigon is alsoto be granted to the Japanese, the bases so far mentioned will provide room forsome 20 squadrons, say, 250 aircraft of all types. There are, however, sufficientadditional aerodromes in South Indo-China capable of accommodating a further100 aircraft, which the Japanese would have no difficulty in acquiring.f4ov( IOIN C-China.71. Starting on the 27th July the Japanese carried out intensive air action,lasting four days, over the province of Szechuan, including Chungking, where,however, the weight of attack was not large. These raids were carried out by naval heavy bomber squadrons operating from Hankow, one of which was shot down by Chinese fighters.Whilst the intensification of bombing activity on these back areas suggeststhat the Japanese may, despite previous failures, still cherish the hope ofcrushing Chinese resistance by this means, there is the possibility that these raids,especially the heavy one on Chengtu (Szechuan Province) on the 29th July, mayhave been an effort to locate and damage some of the Curtiss Tomahawk fightersrecently arrived from America.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General,By Day.72. Very few bombs were dropped by day, but in the afternoon of the1st August the engine room and turret of Longstone Lighthouse (the FameIslands) were seriously damaged, and on the 3rd August considerable damage was done to shops and house property in the centre of Broadstairs. The mainfire station suffered a direct hit, but there was only one fatal casualty.Five shells fell in Dover on the 6th August causing a few slight casualties.By Night.73. Only minor bombing has occurred chiefly along the north-east, east andCornish coasts, and in some of the Eastern Counties. Four aerodromes were also bombed without effect. The most serious incident was at Aberdeen on the night of the 5th/6th August, when buildings and motor vehicles in the Corporationgarages were damaged, and a UXB interfered with the delivery of meat and fishfrom cold storage in the harbour area.Casualties.74. Casualties for the week ending 0600 on the 6th August were 11 killed and 4 seriously wounded.  No casualties occurred in London.[22795]

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports. ,The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : Germany.Mannheim. The raid on the night of the 21st /22nd July was a completesurprise, and the sirens sounded after the attack had begun. On the afternoon of the 22nd fires were still burning in the Rhine harbour area and inLudwigshafen.Munchen Gladbach.-The works of the &quot; Schlaforst &quot; (makers of textilemachinery) have been very severely damaged. There were casualties amongfiremen engaged in extinguishing a fire in the adjoining building.France.Brest. When the Scharnhorst returned to Brest she had a heavy list. Aspreparations for pumping operations on her arrival had been made it seems thatthe report that she was hit by bombs whilst in La Pallice was probably correct.Photographs have shown this battle cruiser to be in a dry dock at Brest, andjuclgingfrom the length of time she has been there, it may well be that she has suffered considerable damage. Subsequent to the above information a report was received that she was holed near the starboard propeller shaft, and that thehole was nearly a yard across. She was also said to have been hit near the bridge,and it is likely she will be out of action for six weeks at least. This damage wouldcertainly account for the previous reports that she was down at the stern andthat pumping assistance would be necessary on her return to Brest. It is probablethat the hole mentioned was the result of the dusk attack on the 23rd July at LaPallice when the crew of a Stirling estimated a hit on the stern with a 2,000 lb.A.P. bomb.Photographs taken on the 24th July show that work is now proceeding onthe Gneisenau. Superstructure, which was in position on the 29th June, has been removed and it is considered that this battle cruiser is undergoing extensiverepairs to her engines which have been previously reported to have been damaged.The Germans are said to believe that the Gneisenau will be in service again inOctober. The Prinz Eugen is reported to have been damaged by a third bombon the night of the 1st/2nd July, the bomb falling between the hull and thequayside, opposite the bridge, which was damaged.On the 24th July a submarine under repair was hit and seriously damaged and a small tanker was sunk.La Pallice. In the raid on the night of the 10th/11th May, oil tanks at thedepot of the Compagnie Industrielle were damaged and dislocation caused by thedestruction of the main points at the railway siding nearby.Le Trait.- One of the submarines under construction has been damagedbeyond repair, and work must start afresh.Lille. In the attack on the steel works at Fives, near Lille, the record office was destroyed, and the workshop, the boilerJiouse and administrative officeswere hit.
