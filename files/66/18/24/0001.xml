F. Harding, C.B.E., M.C., and AirCommodore L. O. Brown, D.S.C., A.F.C., on certain aspects of the G.H.Q., M.E.,Report (circulated under cover of W.P. (41) 159) on the action of the2nd Armoured Division during the withdrawal from Cyrenaica, March-April1941, is circulated by the direction of the Prime Minister.BRIGADIER HARDING was the B.G.S. to H.Q., Cyrenaica Command,and Air Commodore Brown was commanding the R.A.F. in Cyrenaica at thetime of the withdrawal.. 2. On instructions from the A.O.C.-in-C. and the C.G.S. the report was examined with a view to determining the extent to which the statements inparagraphs 3, 4 and 7 in Appendix &quot; B &quot; of the G.H.Q., M.E., report was justified.   These paragraphs read as follows : (3) The false air reports on the 3rd April, about the enemy being at Msus.(4) The frequent changes of orders and regrouping consequent on these airreports, which resulted in the disintegration of formations and units.(7) Lack of tactical Reconnaissances, particularly in the latter stages.3.   With regard to paragraphs (3) and (4), the air reports concerned are : (i) A tactical reconnaissance carried out at 1400 hours on the 3rd April bya No. 6 (A.C.) Squadron operating from Msus landing ground.   the pilot reported enemy A.F.V.&apos;s and M.T. moving towards Msus.(ii) Strategical. reconnaissance carried out by a pilot of No. 55 Squadron,, which reported that at 1830 hours on the 3rd April, 1941, there wasa force of 100 tanks and M.T. in Msus. (Paragraph 19 of the G.H.Q.report refers to both these reconnaissances.) As a result of the firstreconnaissance report the Commander, 2nd Armoured Division, madea change in plan.(Signed)E. E. BRIDGES,Secretary of the War Cabinet.Great George Street, S.W. 1,August 22, 1941.REPORT.[22831]
4. It is agreed that the reports were made, and there is nothing to disprovethat forces were, in fact, there. The question as to whether they were enemy or friendly must have been appreciated at the time of the report. It is not knownhow it was established that the forces reported were enemy.5. The facts surrounding the circumstances leading up to the first recon-naissance have been supplied by Flying Officer Fletcher, and are as follows : The flight was under the command of the 2nd Armoured Division fromthe time that Division took over the front South of Agedabia prior to theGerman advance.At the commencement of the enemy advance Squadron-Leader It. E.Weld, Commanding No. 6 Squadron, was sent forward to command thedetached flight in view of the impending operations.(i) The Flight was ordered by Div. H.Q. to move from Agedabia toAntelat, which it did at 0400 hours on the 2nd April. The flightoperated from Antelat on the 2nd April under orders of Div.H.Q., which was then situated at Antelat.(ii) On the morning of the 3rd April the Flight discovered that Div.H.Q. had left Antelat during the night without their knowledge,and no information was forthcoming until later regarding thenew position of the H.Q. A reconnaissance was, however,ordered by Squadron-Leader Weld in the area of Agedabia, andthis reconnaissance reported the movement of forces fromAgedabia N.E. towards Antelat. At this time there were none of our own troops in the Antelat area. In the absence of orders from Div. H.Q., and in view of the situation, the Flight moved to Msus at about 0700 hours. On arrival at Msus, the only troopsin the vicinity were a few Free French troops in the Msus Fort,about 2 miles north of the landing ground. These Free french troops were unable to give any information concerning theposition of our own troops in the area, nor were they able to saywhere Div. H.Q. was situated. It was not until noon that a message was received from Div. H.Q. giving their position as justNorth of Es Sceleidima, about 30 miles West of Msus.(iii) At about 1330 hours of the 3rd April a tank recovery party withunserviceable tanks in tow passed through Msus aerodrome, andthe officer i/c stated that he was the last party of our own troops to come back from the Antelat area, and that they were goingfurther back as they had no idea of the position on the ground, nor did they know where Div. H.Q. was situated.(iv) No orders were received from Div. H.Q. for their requirements inTactical Reconnaissance, but Squadron-Leader Weld ordered aquick reconnaissance to be carried out along the track betweenMsus and Antelat at about 1400 hours. The pilot of thisreconnaissance was Flying Officer Fletcher. On this recon-naissance he observed a column consisting of a few armoured cars and between 50 and 60 large Italian lorries filled with troops.The head of the column was 5 miles South of Msus. the personnel in the lorries opened fire on the reconnaissance aircraft. The pilot carried out a low-flying attack on thecolumn, and on his return to Msus found that the aerodrome hadbeen evacuated. The pilot observed the C.O.&apos;s car near the Msusfort and dropped his report near the car, after which he flew hisaircraft back to the base aerodrome at Barce. On arrival atBarce, a report was submitted through the A.I.L.O. to ForceH.Q. It was subsequently ascertained from Squadron-LeaderWeld that he ordered the evacuation of Msus aerodrome, as hehad observed the approach of the column from the ground. Theground party of this Flight had considerable difficulty inrejoining its Squadron, and during its retreat it caught up withDiv. H.Q. at the Er regime Pass east of Benina. This groundparty eventually rejoined the Squadron at Maraua on the5th April.
6. At the time the Msus landing ground was evacuated the Free french were still in the Fort. Although we have no confirmation, it seems probable thatthe information concerning the column approaching Msus reached the Free french from ground observation, or as a result of the Tactical Reconnaissance message which was dropped on Officer Commanding No. 6 Squadron, and, acting on theirown initiative, they destroyed the dump. The destruction of this dump was notordered by Command H.Q. It is understood that Captain Hore-Ruthven,K.R.R.C., was with the Free French at Msus at the time, and a report will beobtained from this officer, who is in Syria, and forwarded later.7. Although it is stated that the first report on this day led the Commander,2nd Armoured Division, to change his plan with the object of securing the dumpat. Msus before the arrival of the enemy force, consideration of time and spacewould have shown that this was impossible, and it can only be assumed, therefore,that&quot;&apos;the 3rd Armoured Brigade was allowed to proceed for other reasons.8. With regard to the second reconnaissance report the same day, no furtherinformation is available. It is agreed that the report was based on the presenceof some forces in Msus at the time. It seems most likely that the Free french had evacuated Msus by the time of this report, i.e., 1830 hours, and the3rd Armoured Brigade did not leave for Msus until first light on the 4th April.The inference, therefore, is that the force observed in Msus at 1830 hours was theenemy, and may have been the force that later appeared at Mechili. The fact thatthe 3rd Armoured Brigade found&apos;Msus unoccupied on the 4th April does not prove that there were no enemy there on the previous evening, and the enemycolumn reported South of Msus might have halted there on its way to Mechili.9. Further, with regard to the Recovery Section mentioned in the G.H.Q.,M.E., Report having gone through Msus, it will be seen from Flying OfficerFletcher&apos;s report that a Recovery Section passed. through Msus before the firstreconnaissance was carried out. We have been unable to trace the source of thereport that L.R.D.G. might have been mistaken for an enemy column movingon Msus. The composition of this unit does not in any way tally with FlyingOfficer Fletcher&apos;s report of what he saw. Moreover, Major Mitford, whocommanded the L.R.D.G., states that his party went through Msus between1630 and 1700 hours on the 3rd April.10. The above facts show that neither of the two reports can therefore be clearly classified as &quot; False Air Reports.&quot;11. The reference to &quot;Frequent changes of orders and regroupingconsequent on these air reports &quot; is not understood. There appears to have been only one change in orders, namely, the diversion of the 3rd Armoured Brigadefrom the Sceleidima Escarpment to Msus.12. With regard to paragraph 7 of the G.H.Q. report, i.e., &quot;Lack ofTactical Reconnaissance, particularly in the later stages,&apos;&apos; in our appointments asO.C., R.A.F., Cyrenaica, and B.G.S., H.Q., Cyrenaica Command, we werepersonally responsible for the co-ordination and provision of all airreconnaissances, both Tactical and Strategical. Detailed orders for Tac/Rcarried out by the detached Flight were the responsibility of the 2nd armoured division, under whose control the Flight was operating.13. During the period prior to the main German advance the full requirements of the 2nd Armoured Division for Tac/R could not be met owingto the shortage of suitable aircraft, and it was necessary at times to lend aircraft from fighter squadrons for the purpose.14. As a result of representation made by General Neame, the detachedFlight had been made up in strength in aircraft by the time the main german advance began. Thereafter all Tactical Reconnaissance requirements were met.It is agreed, however, that the general standard of efficiency of No. 6 Squadronpilots in Army Co-operation work was not of the high standard of the army co-operation Squadron that had co-operated with Western Desert Force andXIII Corps during the advance into Cyrenaica. This was due to the generalinexperience of the terrain over which the pilots were operating, as they onlytook over in March.
15. With regard to Strategical Reconnaissances, these were provided bythe Bomber Squadron, and all demands from Command H.Q. were met, inaddition to Strategical Reconnaissances required for R.A.F. purposes.16. There is nothing in the body of the G.H:Q., M.E., report that supportsthe statement made in paragraph 7 of Appendix &quot; B.&quot; It does not correspond with our knowledge of the facts, and we do not know on whose reports or state-ments it was made.17. Although not referred to in Appendix &quot; B,&quot; another &quot;False AirReport &quot; is referred to in paragraph 29 of the G.H.Q., M.E., Report, which reads as follows : &quot;Another false air report occurred on the evening of the 5th April,when Tactical Reconnaissance reported an enemy move northward fromMsus. Cycom was deceived into ordering an immediate renewal of thegeneral withdrawal, but, on being informed by Divisional H.Q. of the truefacts, they withdrew the order.&quot;18. We have no recollection of this report, and the order to continue thegeneral withdrawal was given on receipt of an air report of the advance of anenemy column of considerable force on the El Charruba. Subsequent reports from K.R.R.C. patrols stated that this column consisted of elements of the2nd Armoured Division; this led to the cancellation of the order for a furthergeneral withdrawal that night.19. From ground and air reports received the following day it transpired that this column was, in fact, elements of the 2nd Armoured Division being followed by German forces, and orders were given for the general withdrawal to be resumed that night (the 6th/7th April) in consequence.(Signed) &apos;       L.
