SECRET. Copy. No. 29W.P. (41) 182.July 30, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE DIVE BOMBERNote by the Secretary of the War Cabinet.THE annexed Minute by the Air Staff is circulated, for the information ofthe War Cabinet and the Defence Committee, by direction of the Prime Ministerand Minister of Defence.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Great George Street, S.W. 1,July 30. 1941.ANNEX.IN the view of the Air Staff, the Dive Bomber is an efficient weapon only when (a) it operates with a high degree of air superiority or without fighteropposition, and(b) it is not opposed by a heavy scale of light anti-aircraft defence at the target.2. The only true dive bomber which has been used in this War is the Ju. 87.Experience with this aircraft has confirmed the above view. It has operatedsuccessfully against sea targets which could not be provided with effective defence by land-based fighters. On the other hand, it was a complete failure in the battle of Britain and General Wavell said that, although undisturbed by fighterattack, it did little damage against our retiring columns in Greece.3. The above conditions are never likely to be fulfilled in any operations against the German Forces on land, but will probably only be found whenattacking ships out of reach of land-based fighter defences.4. The R.A.F., like the other Services, was starved before the War. It wasnecessary to concentrate on the provision of necessities for the War as we foresawit.  These were : (a) An adequate fighter force.(b) A bomber force capable of reaching Germany if necessary withoutviolating Holland or Belgium.[227701THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   July 1941.
(c) A general reconnaissance force for co-operation with the Navy in theprotection of trade.(d) A reconnaissance force for the Army.A dive bomber which of necessity would be inadequate for any of theseroles was a luxury which we could not afford.5. In the autumn of 1940 the War Office asked the Air Staff to providedive bombers. In spite of the doubts which the Air Staff felt of their ability to operate dive bombers in support of land operations, they agreed to provide them.Since it would have taken 2^ years to design and produce a British type, it wasagreed to order in quantity two existing American types, the Vengeance andthe Bermuda. These will begin to arrive in the autumn, and it is planned tore-equip ten Army Co-operation Squadrons with them as early as possible.(Signed) W. R. FREEMAN(for C.A.S.).July 16, 1941.
