(41) 575)September 18, 1941V.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 107)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 0700 September 11th, to0700 September 18th,1941[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]
naval SITUATION.General Review.1. British and Russian Naval Forces have successfully attacked enemy shipping in Northern Waters.   Our shipping losses have been light.Home Waters.2. On the llth H.M. Destroyer Vimiera shot down an enemy aircraft whichwas attacking an East coast convoy off Yarmouth.During the night of the llth/12th a force of our motor torpedo-boats and motor gunboats attacked enemy armed trawlers off Cape Gris Nez with lightguns, but the results were not observed.It is estimated that 11,500 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk and18,000 tons damaged by our aircraft.North Atlantic.3. United States Naval Forces are now assisting to escort convoys in theWestern Atlantic and are providing anti-submarine and raider patrols in this area.Northern Waters.4. The military force which landed at Svalbard (Spitsbergen) on the25th August carried out the demolition of the coal mines and coal stocks on the island. In the course of the operations 2,200 Russian miners were repatriatedto Archangel, and the Norwegian residents on the island were brought back tothis country. The military forces were transported in the Empress of Canadawith a suitable escort, and no opposition was encountered throughout theoperations.On the 12th September Naval aircraft from H.M.S. Victorious carried out an attack in Bodo Fjord (Norway). One ship of 2,000 tons was sunk and others were attacked with indefinite results. The power station in Glom Fjord waspossibly hit and fires were started in the aluminium works.Russian submarines torpedoed a transport and a destroyer off Petsamoduring the night of the llth/12th, and on the 14th sank an escorted 3,000-tontransport between Kirkenes and Petsamo. On the night of the 14th/15th twotransports were torpedoed and sunk off Petsamo by Russian motor torpedo-boats.Mediterranean.5. On the 13th a reinforcement of 45 aircraft for Malta was flown off from H.M. Aircraft Carriers Furious and Ark Royal, escorted by units of the gibraltar force. One Hurricane crashed on taking off from Furious, the pilotbeing killed, and two were damaged on landing.The Netherlands submarine 0 21 sank the Italian s.s. Isarco (5,915 tons)with a cargo of phosphates south-west of Naples, rescuing the master and 21of her crew. While returning from patrol in the Gulf of Genoa the Netherlandssubmarine O 24 sank a barque of 1,200 tons and torpedoed and probably sank a merchant vessel of 6,000 tons.  Both were southbound and fully laden.It is estimated that 24,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk and atleast 29,000 tons severely damaged by our aircraft.During the week ten French ships (22,000 tons) westbound and four (7,000tons) eastbound, have passed through the Strait of Gibraltar under escort.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. During the week there have been twenty-one attacks on U-Boats, themajority of which have taken place in the area between Iceland (C) andGreenland. Of the U-Boats which attacked the convoy off Greenland, one was sunk by HM. Canadian Corvettes Chambly and Moosejaw, thirty prisoners being-captured, and three other promising attacks were made in this area. Thirteenattacks were carried out by aircraft, one of which, off Cape Clear, is consideredpromising; but although hits and near misses were reported in six of the other attacks, in no instance was there any definite evidence of destruction.
Enemy Intelligence.7. The pocket battleship A admiral Scheer and the battleship Tivpitz areunlocated. There is no change in the position of other main. German or Italianunits.U-Boats.8. About thirty German U-Boats have been operating during the week.There have been two main groups, one in the area Iceland (C) to south Greenlandand the other to the northward of Rockall. Of the remainder four have been operating in the area of St. pauls Rocks (N.E. of Brazil), and others off theCanary and Cape Verde Islands. There has been no definite information of theposition of Italian U-Boats.Enemy Attack on Trade.9. In the attack on the convoy reported in last week&apos;s Resume, accordingto the information at present available, seventeen ships (65,387 tons) were torpedoed in the homeward bound convoy attacked by U-Boats off Greenlandon the 10th and 11th of September. Of these, seven (20,521 tons) are knownto be sunk and two (8,723 tons) have reached port, but the fate of the remainderis still uncertain. This convoy was again attacked on the night of the 16th/ 17thand one ship was torpedoed.During the present week two outward bound ships were torpedoed to thewest of Ireland. Casualties from bombing have occurred off the Faroes, to thewest of St. Kilda and in the Western Approaches, and early in the week two ships in convoy were damaged off Yarmouth. Two ships have been mined tothe northward of Cromer. On one night in the week E-boats attacked a convoy off Sheringham and torpedoed two ships, both of which reached port in tow.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending the 17th September 1,031 ships, including198 Allied and 21 neutral, were convoyed. Seven armed merchant cruisers, fouranti-aircraft ships, fifty-nine destroyers and one hundred sloops, corvettes andminesweepers were employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the13th September totalled 1,542,157 tons, compared with 708,151 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 946,514 for the past ten weeks. Therewere also two shiploads of about 10,000 tons of special Government cargo.Oil imports totalled 512,590 tons; mineral imports were 325,354 tons, ofwhich 198,504 tons were steel, scrap-iron, pig-iron and iron-ore. Timber andwood pulp imports were 85,740 tons; copra and palm oil, 43,524 tons; andcereals, 208,061 tons; 26 ships being fully laden with grain. 7,339 tons were rice.Other food imports were exceptionally large, the total being 247,765 tons. Theprincipal commodities, in tons, were: sugar and molasses. 72,634; refrigeratedand tinned meat, bacon and hams, 56,663; lard and fats, 15,389; dried and freshfruits, 13,926; cocoa, 7,662; tea, 7,289; evaporated milk, 7,086; cheese, 5,185;jam and honey, 4,781; eggs, 4,339; butter, 3,565.British Minelaying.11. . During the week mines have been laid off North Rona and the Frenchchannel coast. Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out in the Western Balticand German North Sea ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.12. Minelaying by enemy aircraft has again been on a small scale. On thefive nights on which it took place different sections of the Thames Estuary werevisited, and on two nights in the week a few aircraft also visited the bristol channel area, including Milford Haven.A mine, which was laid not later than the 8th April, blew up the tug FlyingKite in the River Clyde on the 15th September, and damaged another tug whichhad to be beached.[22925] b
During the week thirteen magnetic and eleven acoustic mines have, been destroyed, six of them in the Humber area. The mine totals to date are:Magnetic, 1,407; Acoustic, 992; Contact, 1,042. ...Foreign Waters.13. The Suez Canal area was raided on two nights during the week, but the canal was only temporarily closed. ....Six mines were dropped at Tobruk during a raid early on the10th September. ..Enemy Merchant Shipping.14. When Oslo was attacked by the R.A.F. on the 6th September, a norwegian tanker of some 3,500 tons is reported to have been hit and half-submerged; two German transports are also reported to have been hit, one ofthem being sunk and the other set on fire.It is reported from Oslo that on the 12th September the Norwegian Lofoten(1,571 tons) was attacked and sunk off North Norway by H.M. Ships and aircraft.A Finnish broadcast has announced the sinking by enemy action of theFinnish Tauri (2,517 tons).A badly-damaged transport anchored off Helsingborg on the 15th September.It is reported from Sofia that the Bulgarian Ckipka (2,300 tons) sailed fromVarna on the 15th September and was then mined and sunk.MILITARY SITUATION.[An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is included in this resume as an inset.]Russo-German Campaign.15. In addition to a slight German advance over the River Litsa, on the murmansk front, and progress by German forces south of Lake Ilmen, seriousdevelopments have occurred in the Ukraine, where a drive southwards from theGlukhov area wras synchronised with a northward advance from Kremenchug.The two forces are approaching each other, and thus threatening to cut off allSoviet forces approximately within the triangle Nyezhin-Kiev and the confluenceof the rivers peninsula and Dnieper. In the south a considerable German advance hasbeen made from the Berislav bridgehead as far as the northern end of the PerekopIsthmus.Finland.16. A German force of mountain infantry and some motorisecl troopsattacked on the River Litsa on the 9th September. An advance of some three miles was made, but stiff Russian resistance prevented further progress. Fightingstill continues, but a report of the 14th September stated that the Germans hadsustained considerable losses and that the operation had not been successful.17. No information has been received regarding the Salla front, and thereis no indication of a Finnish-German advance beyond the line of the River Svir,to the east of Lake Ladoga, though a Stockholm report of the 16th Septemberasserts that the Finns have broken Russian resistance in the province of Olonets.18. On the Karelian Isthmus no appreciable advance has been made beyondthe 1939 Finnish frontier towards Leningrad.1 Leningrad Sector.19. . Very little progress has been made by the German forces investingLeningrad from the south and east. The line is believed to run approximatelyfrom Schiisselburg, through Krasnogvardeisk, which is in German hands, to. apoint on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland some 45 miles west of Lenin-grad. It is possible that the- Germans have crossed the River Neva nearSchlusselburg, thus threatening the only remaining&apos; communication withLeningrad by way of Lake JLadoga.
Estonia. -    - . (      -  , ;,     -20. The Germans were reported by a neutral source on the 16th september to have captured the island of Worms, but Oesel and Dago remain in Russianhands.Lake Ilmen Sector.21. The German communique of the 16th September claims that strongSoviet forces in the area sOuth of Lake Ilmen have been decisively defeated. Itis claimed that more than 53,000 prisoners, 320 tanks and 625 guns of all calibreswere captured.Central Front.22. There is no further news of Russian operations in the Yelna area. Thefront remains quiet and there are no indications of any Russian counter-attacks against the German flank in the region of Glukhov.Ukraine.- 23. The operations aimed at the encirclement of Kiev and the subsequentdestruction of the Russian forces within that sector had already begun when the bridgehead at Kremenchug was secured over a week ago. At the same time,whilst German infantry kept the Russian forces heavily engaged all along theline of the River Desna, north-east of Kiev, as far as Chernigov, the armouredthrust from&quot; Glukhov was being prepared, and actually began about thellth September. At the same time, strong armoured and motorised forces beganadvancing northwards from the bridgehead at Kremenchug, and it is probablethat the two forces have by now met.24. At the. Dhiepropetrovsk bridgehead the Germans appear to be merelyholding their position pending the further development of operations in theGlukhov-Kremenchug area and south-east of Berislav. Considerable russian forces are believed to be in the Dniepropetrovsk area and to be harassing theGermans without, however, affecting the position as a whole.25. The bridgehead at Berislav has been considerably enlarged and Germaninfantry have reached the vicinity of Perekop. A further advance eastwardstowards the only railway connecting the peninsula with the mainland appearsalso to have heen made and, if developed, would cut all land communication withthe Crimea.Operations.Libya and Egypt.26. In the Tobruk area active patrolling and exchanges of artillery firehave continued.On the night of 13th/14th September, a series of successful raids were carriedout by Australian units on the enemy positions opposite the Eastern Sector of the perimeter. In retaliation the enemy, employing 9 tanks and about 100 infantry,attacked one of our observation posts outside the perimeter and captured thegarrison of six men.On 14tlh September enemy tanks attacked one of our strong points but were driven off by artillery fire.Throughout the week enemy aircraft have carried out repeated attacks onTobruk but damage has been slight.27. In the Frontier area the enemy carried out a reconnaissance in force on 14th September. About 100 tanks crossed the frontier and advanced some40 miles into Egyptian territory, causing our light covering troops to fall back.This force later withdrew, pursued by our light forces and harassed by the R.A.F.By the evening of 15th September, our troops were in their former positions ofobservation.Five eilemy tanks are known to have been destroyed, and a number ofprisoners were taken.   Two of our field guns were lost.      &apos; . ;[22925] &apos; ii 2
28.   It is believed tihe German force in Libya now consists of two normal:   armoured divisions (one perhaps not yet at full strength) and attached G.H.Q.units.   This force, together with the Italian troops, would be sufficient for anattack on Tobruk but a general offensive is unlikely until further reinforcementsarrive and greater reserves of supplies have been accumulated.Persia.29. The frontier area has&quot; been quieter during the last week, and there havebeen no reports of activities by Kurdish tribesmen or rebel Persian soldiers. Partof our armoured forces have moved to Qum, as a result of the decision for a jointadvance on Teheran by the Russians and ourselves.30.   The Shah abdicated on the 16th September.Iraq.31.   Further reinforcements have arrived from India during the past week.Intelligence.Spain.32. Air reconnaissance of the Franco-Spanish frontier reveals a certainaccumulation of M.T. and of fuel dumps and the improvement of north-southcommunications, but activity appears to be slight. This information points to long-term preparations, and a German move into Spain is not consideredimminent.Balkan States.33. The German forces in the Balkan area (including Hungary andSlovakia) are believed to be still 12 divisions. There is no indication of animmediate threat to Turkey, but efforts are doubtless being made to intimidateher in connection with the trade negotiations.A combined operation against the Russian Black Sea Coast, based onRoumanian and Bulgarian ports, still remains probable.Turkey.34. Work oh the Bulair defences is still going on, and great activitycontinues in the area of the Catalca lines. Many anti-tank ditches have been and are being dug here, and over a dozen large blockhouses, under constructionor completed, were recently seen from the Uzunkopru-Istanbul road.Far East.35. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German hostilities, the Japanese havebeen making extensive military preparations in Manchukuo, Korea, Sakhalin andin Japan itself for a possible future attack on the Far Eastern Red Armies.36. In general these preparations have consisted of raising twelve newdivisions, and moving considerable forces from North China and Japan toManchukuo. As a result the Japanese forces in the north, including those in japan proper, probably now outnumber the Russians East of Lake Baikal, whosestrength has been depleted by troop movements to the western front.&apos; TheJapanese are, however, weaker in A.F.Vs. and probably in aircraft.37. Should the Japanese decide to attack, likely objectives would beVladivostock, North Sakhalin and possibly Kamchatka. Successful operations against these places would settle in Japan&apos;s favour her more serious difficulties with the U.S.S.R., namely, the threat of air bombing from Vladivostock, and thequestions of fishing rights off the Kamchatka coast and oil concessions in NorthSakhalin. The season of the year is unlikely greatly to affect the timing of.operations for, although September is undoubtedly the most suitable month forfighting, the Japanese troops are for the most part now well acclimatised toManchurian winters, and are suitably equipped to withstand the cold. It is interesting to remember in this connection that in the Russo-Japanese war of1904-5 the Battle of Mukden was fought under the most severe winter conditions.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.38. Better weather on theContinent resulted in an increased offensive against targets in Germany and enemy-occupied territory. Our aircraft againcarried out many attacks on hostile shipping.In the Central Mediterranean a heavy toll was taken of enemy merchantshipping.Enemy activity over this country continued at a low level.Our fighters have had successes in their initial operations in North Russia.Germany and Occupied Territory.Bay.39. Bomber Command despatched 113 sorties, compared with 57 last week,and dropped 21 tons of FEE. bombs and a few incendiaries. Offensive operations by Fighter Command involved 918 aircraft sorties. . Anti-shipping activity is recorded under &quot; Coastal Operations &quot; and operations against U-Boats in&quot;Naval Situation.&quot;40. The synthetic oil plant and power station at Mazingarbe were the objectives for the only major attack carried out against land targets. two squadrons of Blenheims were despatched with fighter escort; 17 aircraft attacked the : oil plant, where a large building was hit and an oil cistern apparentlyexploded, whilst several fires were started in the target area.41. A number of operations were carried out by fighters. These were on acomparatively small scale except on one day when, in a series of offensive sweepsand bomber-escorts, 515 sorties were flown, during which 12 enemy fighters were destroyed, nine probably destroyed and nine damaged; our losses were 13 Spitfiresbut four of the pilots were rescued.Night.42. Bomber Command despatched 835 sorties, compared with 600 in theprevious week. An improvement in weather conditions enabled attacks to becarried out on six nights. The principal objectives were shipyards, railway centres, and the enemy naval units at Brest.43. On the night of the 13th/14th, a total of 120 bombers attacked the scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen at Brest. Over 170 tons of H.E.bombs and about 850 incendiaries were dropped, but accurate observation wasimpossible owing to searchlight dazzle and an effective smoke-screen whichcompletely covered the targets; the docks are believed to have been hit.44. Intense searchlight dazzle was also encountered on the 15th/16th in anattack by 110 aircraft on Hamburg, where fires were started near the main railway station and the Blohm and Voss shipyards. A similar number of aircraftbombed rail and industrial centres at Frankfurt on the 12th/13th. During theweek between 30 and 50 aircraft reached their objectives at Kiel, Rostok, Havreand (on two nights) Karlsruhe; attacks on a lighter scale were made againstCherbourg and Boulogne.45. Apart from numbers of fires, some of them large, in all these targetareas, the resultant damage was generally unobserved, as detailed observation washandicapped by clouds, extreme darkness and searchlight glare. It may be noted,however, that, among the total of 869 tons of H.E. bombs released during theweek, were twelve of 4,000 lbs., and that the total of 40,500 incendiaries includedover 1,100 fifty-pounders.46. Night fighters operating against aerodromes in northern France and in holland destroyed one enemy aircraft and damaged two more.47. At night, enemy fighters over Holland, Belgium and north-west Germanyoperated on a rather reduced scale. On the night of our attack on Brest, verysmall fighter opposition was encountered.United Kingdom.48. Fighter Command flew, in all their operations, a total of 2,660 sortiesby day and 540 sorties by night; the latter totals include dusk and dawnoperations.
49. Enemy operations against this country have been on a small scale.Bombs were dropped by day in Aberdeenshire and Tyneside. At night no con-centrated attack developed, bombs being dropped by long-range bombers which made brief landfall in widely scattered coastal areas. Our day fighters shot down one Ju. 88, while night fighters destroyed three enemy bombers and probably destroyed another.Coastal Operations.59. Coastal Command flew 237 patrols (378 sorties) and provided 45 convoy-escorts (150 additional sorties). Snipping protection patrols carried out by fighter Command totalled 609 (1,262 sorties).51. Operations against enemy coastal shipping formed the major part ofdaylight operations by Bomber Command, and several attacks on merchant vessels were also made by aircraft of Coastal and Fighter Commands.52. Bomber Command aircraft attacked a convoy of seven merchant vessels,four flak ships and a destroyer off the Frisian Islands, and three of the formerwere claimed as sunk. Another convoy of six ships off the Dutch coast was bombed by aircraft of the same Command; one cargo ship was reported a total loss and, later, a reporting vessel was sunk. The five, ships destroyed totalledabout 11,000 tons.53. In addition, six merchant vessels of a total tonnage of 18,000, are believed to have been damaged by bombs; others were hit by machine-gun andcannon fire during attacks by aircraft of Fighter Command..54. Fifty-one aircraft were despatched to lay sea mines off the frisian islands, Heligoland, and in the western Baltic.55. Long-range bomber aircraft of the German Air Force again concen-trated on anti-shipping activities in the North Sea, particularly off the EastAnglian, Yorkshire and Scottish coasts. Coastal type aircraft operated regularlyin the South-Western Approaches. Attacks on shipping were made on the11th, off Harwich, on the 12th, &quot;off Yarmouth, on the 13th, off Stonehaven, on the14th, off Harwich, Scarborough, north-west Ireland and the Faroes, and on the15th, south of Ireland and off Scarborough. On the 11th a convoy was attackedfive times. In all these attacks only one ship is known to have been sunk. Enemyminelaying was continued, particularly in the Thames Estuary.56. Enemy defensive fighter patrols by day over coastal areas from Brest tothe Frisians were small.   Fighter strength is being rigidly conserved.Central Mediterranean.57. On the 11th September, naval Swordfish, operating under A.O.C.,Malta, sighted a southbound convoy, consisting of seven merchant vessels and six destroyers, 75 miles north of Kerkennah Island. Thereafter a series of night and day attacks were successfully carried out by Swordfish, Blenheims andWellingtons with the result that three merchant vessels of a total tonnage of24,000 were probably destroyed and all the other merchant vessels, of a total tonnage of approximately 26,000, were hit on one or more occasions. ThreeBlenheims were shot down in daylight, but the crew of one was rescued byH.M. Submarine Utmost.58. Three Blenheims, during an offensive sweep of the central Ionian Sea,attacked a small convoy 100 miles south-west of Cape Matapan; a merchant vessel of 3,000 tons was hit at least twice and was seriously damaged.59.-  On three nights a total of 24 Wellingtons from Malta bombed Tripoli (L).On one night six aircraft reported hits on ships lying alongside the SpanishQuay, and many other bursts were seen on or near ships in the harbour.  Swordfish*   and Wellingtons also laid mines in and outside the harbour and around theNorth Mole.60. On the night of the 11th/12th September Wellingtons dropped 16 tonsof bombs on Palermo, and straddled the dry dock containing a merchant vessel.On the 17th, five Blenheims bombed two munition factories at Ligata (75 miles west of Syracuse) with very good effect; many direct hits were made on eachtarget, and three large sheds and one big building in the centre of the installationwere demolished.
Egypt and Libya.61. Attacks on Benghazi harbour were maintained by a total of 38Wellingtons oh six nights during the week; no, spectacular results were reported,but bursts were observed in the harbour area and near ships, and several fires were started, including an oil tanker at the Juliana Mole, which was seen to beburning furiously the following night.62. A total of eight Wellingtons and eight naval Albacores carried outnight attacks on the landing grounds at Martuba and Gambut: three enemy aircraft are known to have been destroyed but many others are believed to have suffered a similar fate. A day attack on Gambut was made by six Tomahawksescorted by twelve Hurricanes; eight enemy aircraft were damaged on the ground,while two Tomahawks were lost.63. On the 14th September, mary lands escorted by fighters made 23 bombingsorties against about 500 vehicles near Alam Dignaish (27 miles N.E. ofMaddalena); several direct hits were made and seven fires started. Duringan engagement with enemy fighters, one Me. 109 and one G. 50 were destroyed and another Me. 109 was probably destroyed, while one Maryland and threeHurricanes were shot down, but the fighter pilots are safe. On the same day11 Italian Ju. 87s were reported to nave landed or crashed in our forward area and some have been captured intact; full details are not yet available. on another day nine mary lands attacked stores dumps at Bardia and started fourlarge fires.64. Our reconnaissance aircraft were active over a wide area, and fightershave maintained patrols covering our forward landing grounds and over Tobrukand shipping.65. Enemy raids on Tobruk were frequent, and on some nights they were almost continuous. Damage was done to stores, but on the whole the militarydamage caused was slight. German aircraft operating from Greece have madeincreasing use of Crete as an advanced landing ground for units operating against Tobruk and Mersa Matruh.66. Two night raids were made in the Suez area by 13 and 18 enemy aircraft respectively; an oil refinery was hit and a warehouse was burnt out in the customsarea. On the night of the 14th/15th September some military damage was causedat Abbassia, near Cairo, in addition to which there were many civilian casualties.A few service and civilian casualties were also sustained in the Alexandria area.67. The bombing of Cairo and relatively frequent nightly alerts haveinduced considerable nervousness in the Egyptian public and an agitation hasbeen started with the support of the Wafd for the declaration of Cairo as an&quot; open city.&quot; The British authorities have urged the Prime Minister to stopfurther agitation and are endeavouring to divert the attention of the public toA.R.P.68. The Germans are evidently making no attempt to carry out intensiveoperations with their Mediterranean force, as they probably anticipate thenecessity to carry out both intense and sustained operations when large-scale land operations in the Western Desert are resumed.Crete.69. On the night of the 12th/13th, ten Wellingtons from Egypt dropped19 tons of bombs on the aerodromes at Heraklion and Maleme, causing fires and explosions. Many bombs fell on the main runway at Heraklion, and it is believedthat ammunition dumps were set on fire.Russia.British A ir Operations.70. On the 12th September, Hurricanes flew 13 sorties on aerodrome defence and 6 sorties as escort to Soviet Bombers. A patrol of four Hurricanes contacted4 Me. 109s and one Henschel, and destroyed two Me. 109s, probably destroyed a
third and damaged the Henschel. Another patrol of four Hurricanes interceptedthree bombers escorted by four Me. 109s; the enemy evaded our fighters and the bombers jettisoned their bombs.Russian A ii&apos; Operations.71. There is no information this week of Russian air operations in theimportant sectors of the front.The Russians are reported to have done no bombing of central, west or northFinland, but they have frequently bombed the town of Porvoo (Borgo), which liesabout 30 miles east of Helsinki, on the coast. The reason for this is not clear,since it is not known that any target of military importance exists there. Up tothe 3rd September Helsinki had had 97 alarms, although only four were followedby bombing.German Air Operations.72. German Air Force activity on the Russian front has been on a mostintensive scale throughout the week. Except at the extreme north and south theprincipal effort has been concentrated in three &quot;comparatively small areas, namely,(a) the Leningrad area, (b) the area south-east of Gomel and (c) the neighbourhoodof the Dnieper bridgeheads west of Dniepropetrovsk. In these areas continuousattacks have been made on Russian troop concentrations and communications bothby long-range bomber and dive-bomber aircraft.73. In the extreme north German Air Force activity appears to haveincreased. Fairly strong concentrations of bomber and fighter units have been identified in the extreme north of Norway for some time and may have been main-tained there in anticipation of British activity in this area. Now that theSpitzbergen operations have been concluded a considerable part of these unitsmay now be used for operations on the Murmansk Front and in Central Finland,as well as against shipping on the supply routes to Murmansk and the White Sea.74. In the Black Sea area heavy bombing attacks have been made againstOdessa and anti-shipping and mining operations have continued, but in other respects the air activity has been on a somewhat smaller scale.75. The intensity of the operations in the three main areas is undoubtedlyputting a great strain on the German Air Force units there and the difficulties of. supply and maintenance are enormous. The scale of effort has been maintained,or even increased, by making the utmost use of every available aircraft, but it is unlikely that a sufficiently high degree of serviceability can be continuously main-tained and some slackening in the offensive may soon become apparent.Finnish Air Force.76. There has apparently been a considerable increase in the intensity ofthe operations of the Finnish Air Force compared with the operations against russia in 1939-40. Pilots are reported to have done five times as much opera-tional flying and a fighter squadron of 15 Fokker D. 21 is reported to have done225 hours&apos; operational flying in a week. The weather is, of course, better now than it was at the end of 1939. The Finns claim that they have still over100 fighters operating, and that their Brewsters, of which they originally had 44,have already destroyed 90 Russian aircraft. There is apparently no shortageof aviation fuel or S.A.A.The Finns claim to have destroyed a total of 335 Russian aircraft, 262between the 22nd June and the 13th August. This number is said to includebetween 20 and 30 Russian I. 18 fighters. Finnish claims during last year&apos;campaing were fairly accurate.1 Far East.Japanese Air Operations in China.77. There has been a lull in the series of heavy raids on Chungking which reached a climax between the 8th and 14th August, when the Japanese heavy bomber forces appear to have made their maximum effort. If the intention wasto shake the morale of the city&apos;s population in.general, or the Government inparticular, the effort does not appear to have been any more successful thansimilar previous attempts in 1940.
Air Intelligence.Withdrawal of Japanese Air Units from Central China^78. Reports from China indicate that a large number of aircraft haverecently been withdrawn from the Hankow area. Although weather conditionsin the Yangtze Valley at this period of the year are unsuitable for effective large-scale bombing, the number of aircraft mentioned suggests other reasons for their withdrawal. As Japanese interest appears for the present to be centred in thenorth they may be intended to reinforce the Japanese air strength in Manchuria,possibly after reorganisation and re-equipment in Japan.Russia&apos;s New Fighters.79. The older types of Russian single-seater fighters now in use have been generally condemned as bad copies of Curtiss and Boeing designs. This is by nomeans the truth. Even less warranted are the criticisms of the new fightermonoplanes which, aerodynamically and structurally, do their designers muchcredit.A Russian test pilot lately had an opportunity of flying a Spitfire VA at an english aerodrome, and was asked for a comparison with the MlG-3, the fastestof the new Russian fighters. His verdict was that the Spitfire is easier to take off,fly and land; that the manoeuvrability of both aircraft is very good and the rateof climb about the same. In his opinion, the MIG-3 is slightly faster, but in thisconnection it must be borne in mind that he did not take the Spitfire up to itsoptimum height for maximum speed.French Air Force.80. There is every indication that the French collapse in Syria has resultedin increased determination on the part of the French Government to strengthen the defences of the French African empire against eventual attack. Since the syrian Armistice there has been a marked increase in the volume of shipment ofwar material from North to West Africa as well as in  he numbers of Air force personnel transferred to North Africa from France (during July these totalledrather more than twice those transferred in June and four times those transferredin May). Other evidence leaves little doubt that an increase in French first-line strength in Africa is also contemplated. -      .HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.81.

Photographs taken on the 7th September disclose damage near the main gasworks, among some railway workshops outside the main station andalso among workers&apos; dwellings near the aerodrome.In the raid of the 7th/8th July a chemical factory at Griesheim was severely damaged. The power house was hit and the southern wing of the factory rendereduseless.   Considerable stocks of chemicals were destroyed.General.-A Dutchman who recently travelled from Holland to Switzerlandwrites on the 21st August, 1941, &quot; on the journey here we saw to our delight thatthe stations at Cologne and Dusseldorf had been badly damaged by direct hits,and that the stations at Karlsruhe and Frankfurt were damaged by bombs whichhad fallen very close. We slept in Karlsruhe in a hotel which had lost practically all its windows the night before. In the station yard were three great bombcraters filled up with sand, and in front of the station there wasn&apos;t&apos;t an unbrokenwindow, and some had the window frames torn out as well. The station clockhad no dial, and the overhead tram wires hung dejectedly down. Since the10th May, 1940, I have not had such a pleasant moment.&quot;Norway.Oslo. In the raid on the 6th September three vessels were hit, one of whichsank. The barracks at Lambertseter were hit, five Germans being killed, and damage was caused to the Drammen glass works.
