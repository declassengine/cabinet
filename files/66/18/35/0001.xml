CYPHER TELEGRAM TO THE PRIME MINISTEROP NEW ZEALAND,Sent 12.50 panio,    2.9.41.No,  340.       SECRET AND PERSONAL.Following is personal and secret message from prime Minister for prime minister a      Begins*      Eventsabout Japan seem to have taken a favourahle turn in thelast month.      The Japanese were then threatening to invade Siam as well as to make jumping-off grounds in indo-China on the approaches to Singapore..      However, as you will have seen from the telegrams sent you about ourAtlantic conference, I persuaded the President to take ahard line against further Japanese encroachments in theSouth Pacific&apos;, and he was also willing to add the North-Western Pacific,      You will have seen the notes delivered&quot;by the United States Government to Japan,      The president and State Department think it a good thing to gain time,be it 30 days or 90 days,  so long as there are no furtherencroachments, and the Japanese seem disposed to parleyon this oasis.     Our interests are served &quot;by a standstill ,and the Japanese for their part want to know what is going to happen to Russia.2o      As soon as the President had made thesedeclarations I made the statement in my &quot;broadcast whichconformed to all we had agreed upon with you and otherDominions &quot;beforehand and has since &quot;been endorsed by allcEncouraged &quot;by this? Russia comes along with a very stiffanswer to the Japanese complaint about American suppliesentering vladivostock.      The Russia Siberian Army has beenvery little diminished so far, and their Air Force is capable, of heavy and much-dreaded bombing cf Japan.      Wehave thus got very heavy forces,  to wit Great Britain and russia coming into line with the United States in thevan, and in addition Japan is sprawled in China.-    Theywould thus have about three-quarters of the human raceagainst them, and I do not wonder they are plunged indeep anxiety and hesitation.      I cannot believe theJapanese will face the combination now developing aroundthem.      We may therefore regard the situation not only as more favourable, but as less tense.3.      Nevertheless the growth of our battleshipstrength,  the- ravages made in the German Navy, which isnow reduced, apart from TIRP1TZ and the U-bcats, to verymodest proportions, and the msasure we now have of theItalian Navy, will make it possible in the near future forus to place heavy ships in the Indian Ocean.      The Admiral.tyare carefully considering what is the best disposition tomake.      But I should like to let you know that as they become available we contemplate placing a force of capital ships,  including first-class units, in the triangle Aden -Singapore - Simonstown before the end of the year.     all this will be without prejudice to our control of theEastern Mediterranean.      I can assure you we are givingconstant attention to all this, and you may be sure weshall never let you down Lf real danger comes.CHURCHILL. Endso
