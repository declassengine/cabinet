S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.if P. (41) 216.      &apos;t is requested that special care may be taken GfcOPY NO.td^S-i- ensure the secrecy of this document.9th September,  19410V/AR CABINETEXTENSION OF POOD RATIONING,.Memorandum by the Lord President of the council* The Minister of Pood has proposed an extension of food rationing for the purpose of secxiring better distribution ofnon-perishable foods in short supply which have not hitherto been subject to rationing control.Distribution of these foodstuffs is unsatisfactory.Local shortages have become more common and more acute;    queuesand other shopping difficulties are giving rise to complaints;and there is a growing demand for action by the Government to remedy the situation,,The causes are twofold.      First, the rationing of staplefoods has naturally sharpened the demand for other footstuffs--^Qft to supplement the weekly ration.      Secondly, thepolicy of price stabilisation has operated to remove thatlimitation on demand which rising prices r,ould otherwise have provided.      The control of prices and the  increase in purchasing,power-have together produced a disequilibrium of demand and supply;    and it has become necessary to introduce some new factor which will curb demand and thus help to secure betterdistribution of the unrationed foods *2o The Minister of Pood has suggested that rationing control should be extended to the following foods -(a) A group of foods which is described, for convenience,as &quot;canned meals&quot; and consists,  in the main, of canned and manufactured meats and fish, meat andfish pastes and canned beansj(b) dried fruits;(c) biscuits;(d) dried pulses; and rice, sago and tapioca.38 There are two alternative methods of control -(a) A Group&apos; System, which would resemble single commodityrationing in that it would involve registration with a retailer .and a definite undertaking that the ration would be honbured.The whole range of foodstuffs to which rationing wasto be extended would be divided into groups, and each consumerwould be entitled to obtain from a specified retailer a fixedamount each week,  or each month, of one or other of the commodities-ties included in a group.This system would have the. advantage that it would follow the lines to which the Ministry of Pood, the trade and thepublic have become accustomed.-1-

(b) A Points System, which would not be rationing in theordinary sense, but rather a method of limiting total demandcoupled with a supplementary price system intended roughly toequalise the supply and demand for a large number of commodities.Point values would be assigned to each of the foods tobe brought under control.      Each consumer would be allowedto use a specified number of points per week, and he would be free to use his points for the purchasing of. any foods he chose,from any retailer who had them in stock.      There would be noregistration with particular retailers, and no entitlement to particular amounts,,      The scheme would be on the same lines asthat now in force for the rationing of clothing.When prices are controlled and no longer operate to curbdemand, a Points System&apos;would provide an alternative means of limiting demand by adjustment of the point values of particular commodities according to relative shortages in supply.This  system would be a novel one so far as food isconcerned, and would give rise to problems which have not been experienced in connection with clothing, where theinintialstock position was relatively favourable and the number of retail transactions is far lesse4. The Lord President&apos;s Committee have reviewed theposition and have come to the conclusion that a Points system is to be preferred to a Group System for the following reasons -(a) It allows the consumer.&apos;    a greater liberty of individual choice of foods -- the poison who does not care forcanned fish can spend his points on other things.(b) It does not involve registration with a particular .retailer.    The housewife who cannot find what she wants atone shop is free to buy elsewhere0(c) It does not favour one class of retailer as against another.    A Group System might prejudice the small trader: for,if consumers   had to register with particular retailers,they would tend to favour the larger shops where they might expect to find a wider variety of goods,(d) The Points System would not impose any furtherlimitation on the spirit &quot;of competition between retailersand to this extent would preserve the retailers&apos;  incentive togive.good service.5. The Committee consider that a Points System of rationingshould be applied to the range of foodstuffs described inparagraph 2 of this memorandum,,     In view, however, of thenovelty of the problems involved, they think that the control should in the first instance be applied only to a limited number of foodstuffs, and that it should be extended to otherfoods within that range when further experience has been gainedin the operation of this system of control.The pressure of demand tends to fall most heavily uponthe group of foods described as &quot;canned meals&quot;, as these aresought after- to supplement the available supplies of freshmeat and fish.     Distribution of these foods    is, therefore,more uneven, and the need for control is more urgent.      Itwould be convenient if rationing control could be applied, inthe first instance, to this group of foods.

6t The Committee therefore submit the following recommendations for the approval of the War Cabinet -(i) Rationing control, by means of a Points System,should be applied as soon as the necessary administrative arrangements can be made to the group of commoditiesdescribed as &quot;canned meals&quot;,(ii) The Minister of Pood should be authorised to extend the Points System of rationing to the other foodstuffsenumerated in paragraph 2 of this memorandum, as soon as he feels justified in undertaking this extension in the lightof experience gained in the operation of a Points Systemof food rationings(iii) The Minister of Food should be authorised toundertake at once the administrative arrangements (includingthe printing of coupons, &amp;c.) necessary to enable him to extend this system of rationing over the whole range of foodstuffsenumerated in paragraph 2 above.(iv) A system of group rationing of foodstuffs shouldnot be introduced unless experience shows that control over&quot;canned meals&quot; by means ot a Points System has failed to achieve its obieot*(Intld.)
