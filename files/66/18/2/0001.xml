NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Our shipping losses have been exceptionally light. Serious casualties have again been inflicted on enemy shipping by our aircraft.An important convoy from the United Kingdom has reached Malta.The Scharnhorst has arrived at La Pallice from Brest.Home Waters.2. Air reconnaissance on the morning of the 22nd showed that the GermanBattle-cruiser Scharnhorst had left Brest. She was located at La Pallice, port of La Rochelle, on the morning of the 23rd and later attacked by aircraft of bomber Command.During the night of the 17th/ 18th H.M. Submarine Umpire collided with one of H.M. Trawlers off Cromer and sank. The Commanding Officer andfourteen men were rescued, but two officers and fourteen ratings were lost.A Focke-Wulf aircraft, while attacking an outward-bound convoy, was destroyed by the s.s. Pilar de Larringa (7,046 tons) about 240 miles west ofIreland (R) on the 18th.A Heinkel III, which attacked a coastal convoy off Cromer on the night ofthe 22nd/23rd, was shot down by the fire of the convoy and escorts. H.M.Destroyer Garth was slightly damaged by a near miss.During the week approximately 71,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or seriously damaged by aircraft of the Coastal and Bomber Commands.Details are given in the Air Section.Atlantic.3. The Vichy French s.s. Isac (2,385 tons) was intercepted to the west of gibraltar on the 19th. Her engines were sabotaged and she was towed intoharbour.The Vichy French s.s. Ville de Rouen (5,083 tons), from Madagascar forDakar, was intercepted by LT.M.S. Dunedin 700 miles south-west of St. Helenaon the 22nd, and is being sent in to Simonstown under armed guard.Mediterranean.4. An important convoy carrying stores, provisions and reinforcements from the United Kingdom passed through the Straits of Gibraltar and arrivedat Malta on the 24th. One ship of the convoy, the s.s. Sydney Star (12,696 tons),was hit by torpedo from an E-boat but reached Malta at reduced speed. Strongnaval forces provided escort and cover. The Mediterranean Fleet also operated in the Eastern Mediterranean in order to create a diversion. In the course of continous air attacks by bombers and torpedo-aircraft, H.M. Destroyer Fearlesswas sunk and H.M.S. Manchester and H.M. Destroyer Firedrake were damaged.During air attacks on an Italian convoy to the south of Pantellaria about25,000 tons of enemy shipping were destroyed or damaged. Naval aircraftobtained a torpedo hit on the stern of an escorting destroyer. Further details aregiven in the Air Section.H.M. Submarine Unbeaten shelled two 500-ton schooners which were atanchor 40 miles west of Tripoli (L), sinking one and severely damaging the other.H.M. Submarine Union is overdue from patrol and must be considered lost.The naval camp at Kabret, in the Canal Zone, was damaged in an air-raidon Suez during the night of the 21st/22nd.During the week eight French merchant ships (upwards of 54,700 tons)westward, and seven (31,216 tons) eastward passed Gibraltar under escort.Enemy Intelligence.German.5. Apart from the movement of the Scharnhorst there have been noimportant changes in the positions of the larger German units. The Pocket-battleship A admiral Scheer is believed to be carrying out trials in the western Baltic.
Italian.The three Italian battleships were still at Taranto on the 22nd July; threecruisers were at Messina and four or five at Palermo.The convoy traffic from Sicily to North Africa, which had appeared to havediminished of late, has now resumed its former volume.U-Boats.6. About 24 or 25 German U-Boats have been operating during the week;of which four have been in the South Atlantic, three in the Azores area and therest to the westward of Ireland (R). It is noteworthy that there are no signs atpresent of any submarines west of 250 W in latitudes north of Gibraltar, or inthe vicinity of Iceland (C). There have been about six Italian U-boats in thearea Azores-Madeira-Cape St. Vincent.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.7. Shipping casualties so far reported have been exceptionally light duringthe period under review. One ship is known to have been torpedoed and sunksouth of Madeira. In the only other U-boat attack a ship was damaged by gunfire to the south-west of Ireland (R). Bombing of coastal convoys on sixoccasions resulted in damage to three ships. One ship was damaged by air attack 240 miles west of Ireland (R). Enemy coastal batteries ineffectivelyshelled a coastal convoy passing through the Straits of Dover.Protection of Seaborne Trade.8. During the week ending the 23rd July, 1,187 ships, including 231 allied and 18 neutral, were convoyed. One battleship, two cruisers, twelve armed merchant cruisers, four anti-aircraft ships, sixty-seven destroyers, three submarines and one hundred and five sloops, corvettes and fleet minesweeperswere employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the19th July totalled 580,737 tons compared with 1,147,564 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 882,283 tons for the past ten weeks. Oil importsamounted to 134,439 tons in 13 tankers. Mineral imports were 144,828 tons, ofwhich 97,697 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. Timber andpulp imports were 29,157 tons and cereal imports 161,011 tons. Food importstotalled 72,163 tons, of which the principal commodities were : Sugar, 33,958tons, refrigerated and tinned meat 17,491 tons, fruit 5,718 tons, cheese 2,585 tons.An oil refinery ship brought 7,225 tons of whale oil.British Minelaying.9. H.M.S. Teviot Bank laid 323 mines off North Rona on the 22nd and, onthe following day, Motor Launches laid 14 mines off the French coast.Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out off North Sea ports and Frenchchannel and Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.10. There have been no casualties caused by mines during the week. enemy aircraft, which may have been minelaying, have been reported off theEast Coast on five nights, although none are suspected in the Thames Estuarysouth of Harwich. Aircraft have been reported off Land&apos;s End on one night,but otherwise the South and West Coasts have not been visited.Two acoustic mines were detonated south of Plymouth Breakwater on the21st July in an old declared area which had not been swept for some time. Sevenother acoustic and two magnetic mines have been detonated during the week.The mine totals to date are : magnetic 1,289, acoustic 908, contact 934.The Farn Islands inshore channel is still closed.Foreign Waters.11. The United States Naval Authorities have notified their intention tomine certain waters in the Philippine Islands.[22753] b
MILITARY SITUATION.[An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is included in this resume as an inset.]Russo-German Campaign.12. The general situation shows little change as compared with the advances in previous weeks, and the German leaders have been at pains to excuse them-selves on the grounds of inevitable difficulties. There is no doubt that supplyproblems are considerable and that much fighting is still taking place behind theleading troops. It is probable, however, that when infantry formations have come up to relieve the mechanised troops, the advance will regain its impetus,subject possibly to some refitting for the armoured formations.Finland.13. The situation in the Murmansk area is satisfactory from the Sovietpoint of view. The only notable advance appears to be on the north-easternshores of Lake Ladoga, where the Germans and Finns claim to have capturedPitkaranta, some 80 miles from the railway Leningrad-Murmansk.Baltic Front.14. In the German advance on Leningrad there has been heavy fighting inthe area Pskov-Porkhov, where the resistance offered by the Russians seems sofar to have been effective in preventing a rapid break-through. It is not clear to what extent the opposing forces will be able to bring up reinforcements to cover the heavy losses claimed by both sides. The advance in Estonia seems to havediminished in importance.White Russia.15. Of the two main eastward thrusts, the first, towards the Dnieper atRogachev, has met with a stubborn resistance; the second, however, has nowadvanced beyond Vitebsk, and armoured elements are to the east of Smolensk.There is little doubt that the spearhead so formed has left behind it wholeformations of Russians who are offering serious resistance to the consolidation ofthe advance.Ukraine.16. The German forces advancing in the direction of the Dnieper aboveKiev have met with considerable opposition, but their progress constitutes aserious threat to this town. The thrust in this area has left the Russian defenceson the Dniester far behind and must either force the withdrawal of the soviet forces in Bessarabia or render their position extremely precarious.Bessarabia.17. The advance of the German and Roumanian forces on Kishinev was successful and continued towards the Dniester, where more than one bridgeheadmay now have been established. The Russians appear to be fighting vigorouslyto hold the river line, but a Russian withdrawal may be taking place in viewof the German advance towards Kiev and may account for the German claimto be pursuing a beaten enemy.Operations.Libya and Egypt.18. Operations have been notable for a series of successful sorties by theTobruk Garrison. On four occasions patrols have carried out offensive raids on enemy positions, penetrating in some cases several miles within the enemydefences and attacking strong points and positions.   The attacks have been pressed home with determination, and have been rewarded with excellent results_casualties inflicted on the enemy have been heavy, while our own have beennegligible.  The effect on enemy morale is beginning to be apparent.
A abyssinia.19. Apart from an unsuccessful attempt by pur forces to carry the Wolchefil.position, north of Gondar, at the beginning of the week, little activity has takenplace. Reports from deserters indicate that the supply position in Wolchefitis becoming desperate, but that the garrison has been ordered to hold out tothe last.Syria.20. The Allied Forces are now taking up strategic positions in Syria andhave reached the Turkish frontier in the north-east. Vichy French troops have moved to certain concentration areas in accordance with the terms of theArmistice.Reinforcements.21.   The following have arrived at Suez : Headquarters, X Corps.Four Heavy A.A. Batteries.69 Infantry Brigade (50 Division).161 Infantry Brigade (from West Africa) less one Battalion.Base and L. of C. troops, and drafts.Intelligence.Spain.22. The continuance of German interest in Spain is shown by the recent visit of a German General to Madrid and the arrival of a mission in the CanaryIslands to inspect the defences.At present the German troops between Bordeaux and the frontier consist ofsome five divisions, including one reserve, two Landwehr and two recentlyformed.Yugoslavia.23. Though spasmodic rioting continues in districts occupied by italians and there is some guerilla activity in the hills, the Italian garrison should be quite adequate to prevent any serious disturbances.&quot;&quot;Bulgaria.24. The Bulgarian army remains mobilised, the greater part being concen-trated in the region of the Turkish frontier, with garrisons in newly-acquiredareas in Macedonia and Thrace. While the possibility of aggressive actionagainst Turkey at some future date cannot be excluded, there are no sighs of this at present.Turkey.25. While the Germans may be planning some offensive action, the onlysigns of such an intention are press reports that they are improving road and rail communications in Bulgaria, and that Italian and German garrisons on some of the JEgean islands have been, or soon will be, increased. There are atpresent no German troops in the area of the Turkish frontier.Libya.26. A report states that the movement of German troops southwardsthrough Italy has been resumed, and that these are believed to be concentratingin Sicily or the extreme south of Italy.In the raiding activities around Tobruk the Italians have shown no substantial increase in determination, even when stiffened by the presence of germans. Knowledge of the conditions enjoyed by Italian prisoners of war isbelieved to be widespread, and may have an increasingly adverse effect on morale.[22753]      &apos; b 2
Iran.27. The Iranian Government continues to show signs of anxiety about the safety of their frontiers with the Soviet, either out of fear of a Russian attackor as a precaution against a mass incursion of refugees from the Soviet Union.German agents are intensifying this anxiety by spreading reports of an Anglo-Russian agreement to partition Iran and of other forms of Anglo-Russiancollaboration, thus playing on the traditional fear of Russia which fills allIranians. The size of the German colony at Tabriz has noticeably increased.The town is of strategic importance, since it lies at the junction of roads from turkey, Iraq and Russia, as well as being the southern terminus of the railwayentering Iran from Russia.Iraq.28. The Iraqi Government have reinforced the area of Sulaimaniya with theobject of suppressing the rebel Shaikh Mahmud by threat of force. Martial Lawis to be declared in Sulaimaniya Liwa, but will not be enforced until militaryoperations begin. The Government are anxious to avoid hostilities, if possible,on account of the uncertain morale and discipline of the army, which has atthe moment no stomach for further fighting.Japan.29. There have been a large number of Japanese troop and transport move-ments .during the past week. Military preparations in Japan, Formosa andHainan also continue.30. In Japan itself reservists up to the age of 45 have been recalled to thecolours, lorries, cars and horses have been requisitioned, large quantities ofbridging equipment appear to have been moved to the west coast, and certaintransport movements have taken place from Japan to destinations so far unknown.31. Japanese forces in the Formosa-Hainan area now total some10 divisions, sufficient both for the existing garrisons and for an overseas force.Recent transport movements indicate that an expeditionary force of two to three divisions might be launched from Hainan.32. In Manchukuo the disposition of Japanese forces has been mainlyde fensive. Recent reinforcements and certain other indications tend to showthat Japan may now be making the necessary preparations to attack should afavourable opportunity offer.AIR SITUATION.General Review.33. The Royal Air Force continued its offensive against industrial andcommunication targets in the Ruhr and in Occupied Territory.Heavy losses were inflicted on enemy shipping in Home Waters and in theMediterranean.Enemy air activity over this country remains at a very low level.Germany and Occupied Territory.General.34. Bomber Command despatched 110 sorties by day and 638 by night, ascompared with 160 and 663 respectively in the previous week. Fighter Commandcontinued their offensive sweeps over Northern France, and during the week flew155 squadron sorties, involving 1,860 aircraft.Day.35. On the 23rd July four Stirlings of Bomber Command attacked the battle-cruiser Scharnhorst, which had been located that morning at La Pallice.
In spite of intense anti-aircraft fire they succeeded in dropping a 2,000-lb. bombon or near the stern of the vessel. They also shot down two out of eight Me. 109swhich intercepted them.  One Stirling was lost.36. On the 21st, three Stirlings attacked the accumulator works at Lilleand, although poor visibility prevented accurate bombing, one large and two small buildings were hit. On the following day the shipyard at Le Trait, nearRouen, was bombed by six Blenheims, and bursts were seen on the sheds and ona slipway. The power station and chemical factory at Mazingarbe, near Lille,were attacked on the 23rd, but results could not be observed because of heavvA.A. fire.37. Fighter Command aircraft provided covering escorts for all these opera-tions except that against the Scharnhorst. They also carried out several offensivesweeps over the Channel and Northern France. In the course of combats our fighters destroyed 41 enemy fighters, probably destroyed 14 and damaged 21.We lost 15 bombers and 33 fighters, but 6 fighter pilots are safe.38. Successful attacks on enemy shipping are reported under CoastalOperations.39. Enemy defensive fighter patrols reached the highest total for several weeks in the Pas de Calais area, the daily average for the week being nearly 400.Night.40. Bombing operations were carried out on six nights of the week, theprogramme for the remaining night being cancelled because of unfavourable weather. Over 670 tons of H.E. and over 58,000 incendiary bombs were dropped,and it is estimated that a large proportion of these fell in the target areas, thoughit was difficult to assess results because of cloud and thick haze. The principaltargets were the industrial and railway centres at Frankfurt, Mannheim, Cologneand Hanover, the docks at Rotterdam, Dunkirk and Cherbourg, and the scharnhorst at La Pallice.41. At Cologne, which was attacked on two nights, and on which 160 tonsof H.E. and 17,000 incendiaries were released, a large explosion was observednear the East Kalk railway station and a particularly large fire was startedamong the factories in the south-west of the city. At Frankfurt, which was attacked on three nights and on which 129 tons of H.E. and 14,200 incendiaries were dropped, several large fires were started, especially at the railway centres and near the post office. At Mannheim, which was bombed on three nights, manyfires also were started, and at least one direct hit was made on the DaimlerBenz Works. At Rotterdam, a fire which was started at the oil stores could beseen by aircraft a hundred miles away.42. The enemy maintained his night fighter patrols over Holland and North-West Germany during the week, but on a smaller scale than of late.United Kingdom.43. Offensive sweeps, bomber escorts and shipping protection patrols againaccount for the bulk of our fighter effort. Fighter Command flew 999 patrols(3,801 sorties) by day, and 390 patrols (570 sorties) by night: the latter totalsinclude dusk and dawn operations.44. By day, only six enemy aircraft were plotted overland during the weekand few interceptions took place, though two He. Ills were shot down off theScillies on the 18th. No enemy fighters operated on this side of the Channel.Shipping and weather reconnaissance flights were on the same low scale as duringthe last few weeks.45. By night, the total number of long-range bombers operating against this country was 170, of which 80 were employed on the 17th/18th, when an attack was made on Hull.   This appears to have been an intensive effort by the forces
available, since subsequent sorties by the units engaged were on a much smaller scale. Shipping off the East Coast, and on one night in the Liverpool area, wasthe main objective on the remaining nights. Enemy night fighters operated overthe eastern counties on the same scale as last week. About a dozen Royal AirForce stations were bombed without serious incident, probably by the nightfighters. Two enemy aircraft were destroyed by A.A. during the week, but therewere no night fighter interceptions. During the attack on Hull, the enemy,though based in some instances on Northern France, approached the target fromthe east, having flown coastwise along the Dutch Islands before crossing theNorth Sea.46. During the five weeks ending on the 19th July, 97 Royal Air force personnel and 17 Germans have been saved by the Royal Air Force Sea RescueService. Since its formation in February this service has rescued 329 officersand men.Coastal Operations.47. Coastal Command flew 252 patrols (364 sorties) and provided escortsfor 94 convoys (264 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols carried outby Fighter Command totalled 704 (1,476 sorties).48. Several attacks on enemy shipping were made during the week by aircraft of Bomber and Coastal Commands, which were highly successful in spiteof intense A.A. fire from Flak ships. On the 18th July, three Blenheims attackedoff Gravelines a 6,000 ton tanker, which was protected by six Flak ships. direct hits were scored, with the result that the ship was beached in a sinking condition.On the following day, two more successful attacks took place. Eleven Blenheimsbombed an enemy convoy of eight merchant vessels, escorted by six Flak ships,off the Hague, as a result of which four vessels, totalling 22,000 tons, were destroyed and one of 500 tons was damaged. A further eight Blenheims attackedanother convoy of seven merchant vessels escorted by about six Flak ships offNordeney. Direct hits were obtained on a tanker of 10,000 tons and on threemerchant vessels of 8,000, 6,000 and 2,000 tons respectively, all of which were sunk, while another merchant vessel of 3,000 tons was damaged.49. On the 20th, six Blenheims hit a tanker of 6,000 tons off Le Touquet with three H.E. bombs and several incendiaries, causing terrific explosions and hugecolumns of black smoke. The vessel was beached later near Berck-sur-Mer. Otherenemy casualties include a merchant vessel of 4,000 tons at St. Nazaire, another of 1,500 tons off Egersund, and a third of 2,000 tons off Borkum, all of whichreceived direct hits. Other vessels were attacked with bombs and machine gunfire, but results could not be accurately observed50. On the 23rd, a Hudson on convoy escort shot down a Focke-Wulfeaircraft into the sea 107 miles W.S.W. of Achill Head. The crew of the aircraft were picked up by a naval unit.51. A number of patrols were flown by aircraft of Coastal Command on the22nd and on the morning of the 23rd to locate the Scharnhorst. At 0915 on the23rd, a photographic reconnaissance showed her at La Pallice.52. A total of 62 aircraft laid mines off Brest, Lorient, St. Nazaire, the frisian Islands and in the mouths of the Elbe and Weser.53. Minedaying was carried out by about forty enemy aircraft off theEast Coast. Enemy attacks on shipping were made on four nights of the week,and are referred to in the Naval Section.Gibraltar.54. The usual convoy escorts and anti-submarine patrols were flown.A search was made for a missing Blenheim which was located, burnt out, inMorocco. A Swordfish of the A.A. Co-operation Unit landed and rescued the crew under fire from the local Arabs.
Central Mediterranean.55. The feature of the week has been a highly successful attack byBlenheims and Naval Swordfish on a convoy off Pantellaria on the 22nd. Thisconvoy, consisting of four merchant ships and five destroyers, was located by air reconnaissance, and later four Blenheims were despatched to attack. Two ships of 6/7,000 tons were each hit twice and a third ship of about 5,000 tons, whichwas hit three times, blew up and disappeared. An hour later, a Maryland sighteda merchant ship of about 7,000 tons with only the stern above water, with two destroyers picking up survivors. At dusk, five Naval Swordfish followed up the attack on the convoy, which now consisted only of one tanker, one small merchant ship and one destroyer. Two torpedoes struck the tanker, which is claimed as atotal loss, and the destroyer was severely damaged by a hit in the stern.56. Wellingtons dropped 9-1 tons of bombs during the night of the 17th/18thon the dockyard at Palermo, where four cruisers and six destroyers were berthed.Owing to an effective smoke screen, the fall of bombs could not be pin-pointed,but many bursts were seen round the estimated position of the ships. On the night of the 20th/21st, nine Wellingtons attacked the railway sidings at Naples,dropping a large number of incendiaries, followed by 1\ tons of H.E. Large firesresulted, and subsequent photographs confirm hits on sheds in the railway yard,and show a row of trucks burnt out. Two Blenheims made a daylight attackon the power house at Tripoli (L), and hits were observed on the target; one ofthe Blenheims was shot down by an enemy fighter. The following night, fourSwordfish bombed the harbour, narrowly missing a ship and starting a fire onthe foreshore.57. The usual areas have been covered by visual and photographic reconnaissance, and a Maryland so engaged shot down an Italian three-enginedfloatplane in flames off Syracuse.58. The enemy have shown little inclination to approach Malta by day,though on one occasion a bomber escorted by twenty fighters reconnoitred the island. Attacks have been made on the island during most nights of the weekby up to nine aircraft, but for the most part bombs have fallen harmlessly in fields;a wireless station was slightly damaged.Egypt and Cyrenaica.. 59. There was little activity by day, apart from reconnaissance flights and fighter patrols covering our coastal shipping. Wellingtons have continued theirnightly attacks on Benghazi, and bombs burst near the Government Offices,barracks, power station and M.T. workshops, and in the harbour district, wheremany fires broke out. A fire followed by a particularly violent explosion resulted from an attack on the mole at Derna, and Bomba and Bardia have also suffered damage.60. Daylight attacks have been made by enemy aircraft on Tobruk, MaatenBagush and Mersa Matruh, but without serious consequences. Alexandria was attacked by about twenty aircraft on the night of the 18th/19th, but the harboursuffered no damage. A few nights later, the Canal Zone was bombed by fiveaircraft which slightly damaged four Wellingtons. Reference has been madeunder Naval Situation to naval damage and casualties.Cyprus.61. On the 18th, four Ju. 88s bombed the Nicosia area, but caused noservice damage or casualties.  One of the raiders was shot down by a Hurricane.East Africa.62. Bombing attacks were continued against the remaining Italian centres of resistance in the Gondar area. Royal Air Force Wellesleys, Free FrenchBlenheims and South African Air Force Ju. 86s have taken part in these operations. Two Italian fighters, operating from Azazo, South of Gondar, twiceattempted to interfere, and slightly damaged some of our aircraft, but were
themselves hit. Our fighters machine-gunned Azazo aerodrome, setting fire tohangars.Russia.63. Unfavourable weather conditions have interfered with operations on theRussian front to a considerable extent, with a consequent decrease in air reconnaissance of Russian troop movements and aerodromes which has formed avery important part of German Air Force activities.64. The Germans have moved near enough to Moscow to give fighterprotection to bombers, which have operated over the Capital in considerable numbers. Apart from these attacks, there have been few developments duringthe week.65. Reports of damage during an attack by Russian Naval Aircraft onPloesti oil refinery on the night of the 12th/13th have been confirmed byphotographs. It appears that, in the Orion refinery area, tanks containing about,000 tons of oil were damaged or destroyed, while considerable damage was probably done to buildings. Up to 100 tank cars on the railway line adjacent tothe refinery were apparently damaged or destroyed. There were fewer fires atthe Astra plant, but there was one near the cracking plant and one close to thelocal power plant and boilers. Some small tanks and some railway cars were also destroyed. Another report states that bombs fell and destroyed most of theUnirea refinery. The fire caused by the bombing is said to have burned for18 hours, and to have destroyed 20,000 tons of oil. It is thought that the refinerywill be out of action for six months.Air Intelligence.Italy.66. It is reported that a small force of Italian aircraft, including somesquadrons of single-engined fighters and a few army co-operation aircraft, are totake part in the Russian campaign.Spain.67. It is learned that 120 Spanish fighter pilots have been accepted by theGermans for service on the Russian front. All of the pilots selected have been trained on Me. 109s in the Spanish Air Force.The total is estimated to represent about 30 per cent, of the fully-trainedfighter pilots in the Spanish Air Force, and will aggravate the shortage of flyingpersonnel which at present constitutes the most serious of the many factorsmilitating against its efficiency.Small bodies of ground personnel are also to be despatched to Germany, and both pilots and ground staff are to have the status of volunteers seconded from airforce duties. Though its immediate significance is slight, the measure willprovide the pilots concerned with a preliminary period of operational trainingin Germany and, perhaps ultimately, with experience of war conditions and of active collaboration with German units.France.It is claimed in the French press that a considerable number of aircraft were withdrawn from Syria to Metropolitan France before the signature of theagreement which terminated the Syrian campaign. Withdrawals are known tohave involved a minimum of one fighter and two bomber groupes.Turkey.It is reliably reported from Canakkale that Turkish A.A. guns shot down an italian aeroplane on the 15th July in the Gulf of Enos, near the Graeco-Turkishfrontier.Japan.Although details are lacking, there is some evidence that a movement of aircraft from North and Central China to South China took place about the endof June.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.68.   No bombs were dropped on land during the week.By Night.69. Bombing was again on a small scale except for an attack on Hull onthe night of the 17th/18th July. This attack was the heaviest since that madeon Birmingham and Nuneaton on the 16th/17th May. During the rest of theweek bombing occurred in Scotland, Yorkshire, the Midlands, East Anglia and north-West England. Towns particularly affected were Aberdeen, Corby,Lowestoft, Yarmouth, Liverpool and its surrounding districts.Damage.Hull (7th/18th July).70. The attack lasted for about two hours. 160 fires were started but only four became serious. Over 3,500 people were rendered temporarily homeless.Public utility services received considerable damage but repairs are well in hand.Several important factories were affected, the more important of which were : Messrs. Spillers Ltd. Swan Mills. Completely gutted.Messrs. Sanderson &amp; Co. Oil refinery put out of action.Aberdeen (20th/21st July, 23rd/24th July).71. Extensive damage was done to house property, the Fish market, RegentsQuay and utility services.Lowestoft (21st/22nd July);72.   Extensive damage to house property.Birkenhead (23rd/24th July).73. A public shelter was hit, causing several casualties. Damage was alsodone to utility services.Casualties.74. The casualties up to 0600 hours 23rd July are estimated at 132 killed and 122 seriously injured, of which 111 were killed and 108 seriously injuredat Hull on the 17th/18th July.[22753]c

Photographs taken on the 11th and 12th July show damage tohave been heavy and widespread. The principal feature is the number ofcompletely burnt out buildings, both industrial and private, in numerous different parts of the town. Two 4,000 lb. bombs have been plotted, the approximate areasof complete destruction resulting therefrom being 180 by 70 yards and 90 by65 yards, but experience suggests, that the total damage must extend over a much larger area. The works of Fabrik Stille on the west of the goods station, makersof agricultural implements, has been completely destroyed.Aachen. Photographs taken on the 14th July show the raid on the10th/11th July to have been beyond question one of the most successful attacksyet made upon Germany. For the tonnage of bombs dropped the damage shownis the most extensive yet seen. There are three main areas of extensive firedamage in the centre &quot;of the town affecting the principal municipal buildings,the business area and the shopping centre. These three areas comprise nearly30 per cent, of the town, not taking into account the suburbs. The gas workswas hit and warehouses and buildings in the goods station were damaged by fire.It is said that 830 people were killed in this raid, and a traveller from belgium on the-11th July stated that a delay of two hours occurred at Aachen,where damage and disorganisation were evident.osnabruck. In the raid on the 5th/6th July the copper and wire works and warehouses at the station were hit. The lines to Bremen and Munster were closedto traffic on the 6th July.Bremen. Jn the middle of June repairs were being carried out to two of theslipways which had been badly damaged in the Vegesack Yard.Bielefeld. The Durkopp works (which in peacetime manufacture sewingmachines) has been severely hit. Incendiary bombs fell on a military campsituate in some woods about 5 miles away and the camp was burnt out.Krefeld. Photographs taken on the 12th July show that the two Hampdenswhich attacked on the 7th/8th July caused an area of damage in the DelschlagerStrasse and the Maria Strasse. These streets are in the centre of the town, andhaving regard to the small tonnage dropped the attack was most effective.North-West Germany. At Minden fuel storage tanks have been hit and houses destroyed. The stations at Soest and Unna have been hit, damage at theformer being severe. Passing by train through Elberfeld, damage can be seen on each side of the line, and, thanks to temporary repairs, at Barmen the trains crossa bridge which has received a direct hit. Commercial buildings at Guterslohand Opladen have been damaged, and at the latter place it was apparent that thetrack had recently been repaired.dusseldorf Area. A works at Neuss making flame-throwers, and the mainline to Benrath have been hit.Cologne. The Mulheim Bridge has been hit and warehouses of the RhineShipping Company to the south thereof have been burnt out or severely damaged.General. It is learnt that to aid the Germans in assessing damage from theirphotographs of London, Berlin was photographed after one or two of our raidsfrom an equivalent height. It was found that the actual number of hits farexceeded those disclosed by the photographs.
Italy.The raids on Palermo on the 6th July and on Naples on the 9th July were successful. At Palermo six ships were sunk. At Naples the attack coincided with a proposed departure of a convoy for Tripoli. The port area was damaged and a cruiser hit. The attack on Naples caused the air raid warning to be givenin Rome.Holland.Shipping. Photographs taken on the 14th July during an attack on a convoy off Ijmuiden show hits on a merchant vessel of about 6,000 tons. As a result ofrecent attacks off the Dutch Coast and at Rotterdam there is a growing desireamongst businessmen against routeing their goods, especially for Scandinavia,through Dutch ports.
