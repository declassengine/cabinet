(41) 181. /July 31, mi/WAR CABINET.THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE attached confidential report on the political situation in the Unionof South Africa, which has been prepared in the office of the United kingdom high Commissioner at Pretoria and forwarded by Lord Harlech, will, I think,be of interest to my colleagues.C.Dominions Office, Jidy 31, 1941.Memorandum.THIS memorandum reviews the resumed session of Parliament, the27th January-6th May, 1941, and is designed to follow up the memoranda of the27th May and the 1st October, 1940.2. The Prime Minister, in an address to the Transvaal Head Committee ofthe United Party a few days ago, declared that the recent session had been &apos;&apos; themost successful ever held.&quot; Mr. Blackwell told his constituents that he doubted whether in any session since Union had so imposing an amount of legislationbeen put through by any Government in so short a time. The Government had secured votes for &quot; colossal and hitherto undreamed-of &quot; sums of money for war expenditure, and a vast volume of constructive and necessary legislation hadbeen added to the Statute Rook. Mr. Hofmeyr has stated that he wasthoroughly satisfied with the session. The Government had succeeded in securingthe passage of every Bill which it wished to have translated into law, and, forthe first time, so far as he knew, in the history of the Union Parliament, therehad been no &quot; slaughtered innocents.&quot; Relations, moreover, between Govern-ment and Opposition members were much better than in the previous session; thenormal pairing system had been re-established and there was close and fruitfulco-operation between the Whips, with the result that the closure was applied farless often than in previous sessions and the guillotine was invoked sparingly.That this result was achieved was due to untiring work by the Speaker,Mr. Jansen, and the Clerk of the House, Mr. Kilpin. It will be recalled fromprevious memoranda that the latter had given much thought to the problem andhad decided that co-operation between the parties provided the only hope. his views have now been justified, and he and Mr. Jansen are to be congratulated onthe patience and energy they displayed.[22768] &quot; b
3. If, however, the session was a great success from the point of view ofthe Government, it must be said that this success was won at the expense of an opposition which had given the feeblest performance in the Union&apos;s Parlia-mentary history. There need be no magnanimous concern for the reputation ofthe Opposition Parliamentary party; but, as the success of Parliamentaryinstitutions depends in a very real sense on the co-operation of Government and opposition, the deplorable showing of the Nationalist Opposition in the recentsession is not altogether a matter for rejoicing. Their failure was partly due tothe fact that internal struggles for power absorbed the force of the party, but itis more ominous that for many members of the Opposition the democratictradition has apparently lost its vitality. This is inevitably the result of the weakness displayed by many of the democracies in the present world conflict.A tendency towards totalitarianism would seem curious in a race which hasthroughout its history found it difficult to combine if it were not for the fact thatthis tendency has triumphed in countries formerly so torn by internal strife as germany, Italy and Japan.4. The principal features of the session will be discussed under thefollowing headings :  (a) The Government;(b) The Opposition; and(c) Legislation..(a) The Government.5. One of the outstanding impressions of the session is the extent to whichthe personality of the Prime Minister imposed itself upon the House. This maybe ascribed partly to the absence of General Hertzog, who, despite eccentricitiesof temperament and an outlook which has always suffered by contrast with thenotable magnanimity of General Smuts, did contrive for a period of more than twenty years to give the conflict between these leaders, even when they were infusion, something of a dramatic quality. In his stead were to be discerned thewintry features and ponderous form of Dr. Malan, who is completely lacking inthe sympathetic qualities of his predecessor, and in the great personal qualitiesthat have won for General Smuts not only the devotion of his own party, but thereluctant admiration of nearly every member of the Opposition as well. Man forman, Dr. Malan is hopelessly outclassed by the Prime Minister.6. It is a sign of General Smuts&apos;s personal ascendancy that this sessionwas disfigured by none of the disgraceful attacks which the Opposition permittedthemselves to make upon him in the previous war sessions. Malice had left himunmoved; he was the recognised master of the country and the firmness andmoderation of his actions had compelled the admiration even of his bitteropponents. He was assiduous in his attendance and went out of his way to showhis respect for Parliamentary forms. As the war leader, he received anunquestioning obedience from his own followers, and there was never any indication of serious division in their ranks. In a coalition which draws its support from such normally conflicting elements as mine-owners and theirworkers and includes in its Cabinet representatives of Big Business as well as of Labour, there are bound to be clashes of interest; but these the Prime Ministercontrolled with the utmost firmness, and they were never allowed to get out of hand. Everyone, for example, expected trouble when a Bill setting up a state system of workmen&apos;s compensation insurance in place of a notoriously wastefuland inefficient private system was published. Enormous pressure was broughtto bear on the Government by the interests concerned, and in the United Partycaucus a minor revolt was led by Mr. Pocock, Mr. Hirsch and other members whowere opposed to the principle of State&quot; intervention. General Smuts, in anindignant speech, intervened in the discussion and told the dissident membersthat they were mistaken if they thought the war was being fought to maintain-the regime of big profits. Mr. Pocock and his friends capitulated. The united party and its allies have too slender a majority in Parliament to be able to afford the luxury of cabals and division; but it is certain that the unanimous deter-mination to see the war through to the end has done more than anything to hold the coalition together in an enthusiastic unity. &apos;   &apos;
7. Next to General Smuts, in fact if not in title, conies Mr. Hofmeyr. Evenmore than in previous sessions it was he who discharged the functions of leader of the House. Besides his departmental work, which included a comprehensiverevision in the whole system of taxation, he carried on the business of the Housewith an efficiency that has added still further to his reputation. If he is to be criticised at all it is for the unaccustomed arrogance of his treatment of criticsof his financial policy. This criticism was frequently inept, but by his asperityMr. Hofmeyr went far to destroy the fund of goodwill which his tolerance and patience in previous sessions had built up to his credit. There is no doubt thatthis roughness was due, in increasing measure as the session proceeded, to thefatigue engendered by his immense labours. Mr, Hofmeyr is a much youngerman than the Prime Minister and he keeps himself fit by violent and pertinaciousexercise. No man, however, could bear the burden he shouldered throughout the session without coming dangerously close to the cracking point, and some alarmwas felt by those who knew him best at the intense weariness which overtook him at the close. His recuperative powers are, however,! great and he will be fitenough when Parliament reassembles. Mr. HofmeyrV labours are indicative ofthe weakness of the Cabinet as a whole; when Mr. Lawrence was absent on sickleave at the beginning of the session, it was Mr. Hofmeyr and not the unemployedMinister without Portfolio or any of the more lightly worked Ministers who took over the two departments of Interior and Public Health in addition to the two(Finance and Education) he normally handles.8.   On the broader question of Mr. Hofmeyr&apos;s future, it is still difficult toform an opinion.   Political commentators were much struck by a tribute whichthe Prime Minister paid at a recent party meeting to Mr. Hofmeyr&apos;s work duringthe session.  This tribute has been taken as an indication of the Prime Ministersdesire to encourage the country to think of Mr. Hofmeyr as the most likelysuccessor to himself when the time comes, after the war, for General Smuts to devote himself to his declared intention of &apos;&apos; going botanising in Africa.&apos;&apos;   when this difficult question of a successor to the Prime Minister is discussed it iscustomary for his supporters to throw up their hands in despair and bewilder-ment.   Good party men assert vehemently that Mr. Hofmeyr &quot;would never godown in the country.&quot;     They advance as reasons his failure to achieve any considerable following among the Afrikaans-speaking peoples and the less cogentstatement that he is too &quot; academic &quot; to be a good leader.   When, however, theyare asked whether there is any alternative introspect they look acutely embarrassing-rassed and, if pressed, admit in desperation that, perhaps after all, Mr. Hofmeyrwould be elected leader for sheer lack of someone with all the necessary qualities.They usually add a dark allusion to the necessity of divine intervention if thisshould happen. This position is obviously unsatisfactory; but the fairest view maybe that Mr. Hofmeyr has been too much overshadowed by the personality ofGeneral Smuts to be able to find scope for the qualities necessary for politicalleadership in this country.  When the time comes he may well surprise the judges of political form by giving proof of hitherto unsuspected components in hismake-up.   This is a hope shared by many people concerned for the future of theUnion.9. After Mr. Hofmeyr in relative importance there comes Mr. Sturrock, a thorough Scot, whose reputation as a most capable administrator and man ofexcellent judgment, common sense and pleasant manners continues to grow.Mr. Sturrock&apos;s reasonableness and moderation and his painstaking attempts to learn Afrikaans have made him perhaps the most popular of Ministers amongthe Opposition. This popularity is an asset the value of which was demonstratedby the remarkable ease with which he secured the passage through the House of aBill providing pensions for casual workers on the railways. &quot;&quot;The Bill affected48,000 non-European workers and only 7,000 Europeans; and it is probable that noother Minister could, have smuggled it through without arousing the. temporarilysleeping, dogs of race prejudice. His only lapse, from the point of view of theUnited Party, was a statement in the early stages of the session that &apos;&apos; he had no knowledge &quot; of the subversive activities of the Ossewa Brandwag in the Railways.This statement could hardly be true (for reports of such activities are frequentlyplaced before the Minister, and several railwaymen have been dismissed orinterned), but savoured of the malicious, even though most people must have felt[22768] &apos; b 2
at the time that he was talking with his tongue in his cheek. It is well known that Mr. Sturrock, as the leader of the Moderates in the Cabinet, was opposedto the War Measures against the Ossewa Brandwag advocated by Mr. Lawrence.The Prime Minister finally came down, at any rate so far as concerned the taking of powers, on the side of the Minister of the Interior, and Mr. Sturrock has tendedsince then to adopt an attitude that can only be described as &quot; naughty.&quot; Theremark quoted above was typical of this, and while it did not, as has beenrumoured, lead Mr. Lawrence to offer his resignation, it provoked severe criticism.Even now Mr. Sturrock is reluctant to face facts and is apt, for instance, to treatas merely humorous the presence at wayside stations of cheering crowds whoextended a hearty welcome to train-loads of Italian prisoners of war. It neveroccurred to him to investigate the conduct of the station masters or other railwayofficials who divulged to the Ossewa Brandwag or their sympathisers the times when the special trains were due and his remedy was to arrange for the trains topass the stations in question at inconvenient nocturnal hours. Events are,however, against Mr. Sturrock; he is a sensible man, and it may be expected thatin time he will open his eyes to what is going on around him while alwayspreserving an attitude of moderation and compromise.10. Mr. Lawrence, who holds one of the key posts in the Government, once again gave proof of no little Parliamentary capacity. He kept the Oppositionadmirably at bay in the debates on his two Bills to amend the Electoral Law bills which raised very delicate issues of party advantage; and he showed throughoutthe session a very thorough grasp of his departmental work. It is disappointing,however, that he suffers somewhat in the public estimation as a result of aflamboyancy of temperament which has got him more than once into a difficult position. For some months he carried on against the Ossewa Brandwag a vigorous campaign of threats and denunciations which were no doubt fully justified by the facts but which many, even of his friends, felt to be a mistake, inview of the split in the Cabinet as to the necessity for decisive action. Thiscampaign aroused great resentment among the Opposition, who attributed theWar Measures against the Ossewa Brandwag to Mr. Lawrence, and it led directly to the outrageous personal assault on him when he went to address a united party meeting at Klerksdorp. There was some public indignation over thisassault, as a result of which he was, indeed, hurt more seriously than had atfirst appeared; but it must be confessed that even among many government supporters there was a feeling that Mr. Lawrence had in the past not been entirely innocent of provocation. While he was amply vindicated by the verdictof the subsequent trial, it must be said that such is the illogicality of humannature, his reputation has received a set-back; and the Opposition ever since havetaken the rather damaging line that he is a &quot; little Minister &apos;&apos; who is undulypuffed up by the sense of his authority and had, in fact, only got what he deserved.He has now completely recovered from the effects of the assault on him, butthroughout the session he was a sick man, which makes his capable handling ofthe House all the more meritorious.11. Of the other Ministers there is not much to be said. Dr. Steyn, theson of ex-President Steyn of the Orange Free State, has a department whichalmost &quot; runs itself&quot;; and he is more concerned with the problems of political organisation than with the broader questions of policy. He was involved insome unpleasantness when the Nationalists severely criticised the appointmentof his chief political organiser in the Free State to a post in the LandsDepartment, which will apparently involve a certain amount of inquisitioninto the political sympathies of settlers on the Government settlement scheme.The man concerned has a most unpleasant reputation, and while Senator Conrovas the Minister most concerned in the appointment had to bear the brunt of criticism, hardly anyone had any doubts as to who was really responsible.Criticism of the appointment was not confined to the Opposition, and evenCabinet Ministers have been heard to express the most violent views on thesubj ect.12. Mr. Madeley, as sponsor of two important items of social legislation,was much in the forefront. He struck heavy weather during the passage of hisFactories Bill when he essayed the impossible task of convincing the Nationaliststhat the Bill had met their demands for a colour bar in&quot; the factories, while at the
same time persuading the Natives&apos; representatives that no such ^ discriminationwas intended.   His treatment of the Natives&apos; representatives in negotiationsoutside the House was, to say the least, disingenuous, and in the House itself itverged on downright rudeness.   The Minister succeeded, however, during the debates on his Workmen&apos;s Compensation Bill, in which virtual unanimity was achieved, in maintaining the affability which is normal to him in ordinary socialintercourse.  On the whole it must be said that as a result of this very substantiallegislation to his credit he has emerged from the session with some increase of prestige.   His inability to keep his temper remains, however, his greatest andmost obvious weakness, and it was striking that on two occasions the CapeTimes, usually the most subservient of papers, felt compelled to rebuke him forhis unmannerliness.   Undoubtedly, however, Mr. Madeley&apos;s labours during the session were far and away the most important from the point of view ofmaintaining the Governments position in the country.   The majority of tradesunionists in South Africa are now drawn from the Afrikaans-speaking section ofthe community, and there is a very real danger that they will, once the war issue,which cuts across the normal political alignment, is out of the way, either forcetheir English-speaking leaders to co-operate with the Nationalists, or else jettisonthem in favour of leaders drawn from the left wing of the Nationalists.   Theformer course has already been taken once when, after the Smuts Governmenthad repressed riots on the Rand in 1922, Labour joined the Nationalists to. putGeneral Hertzog in power for fifteen years.   The main effort of the Nationalistson the Rand since September 1939 has been concentrated on securing control ofthe Mineworkers&apos; Union by means of the &quot; Reformer &quot; group within it led byDr. Albert Hertzog, the son of General Hertzog.   They narrowly failed inDecember and January last,  and Mr. Madeley has  seen the  danger  andconcentrated on the passage of social legislation which enables the Labour Partyto offer substantial achievement as a counter to the promises of the Nationalists.In a speech this month Dr. Malan has proclaimed that &quot; the Afrikaner must con-quer the cities if he wants to live,&quot; and he will eventually do so if the government does not continue to implement the programme of its Labour wing.   The latternumbers only four representatives in the House of Assembly, and their programme is contrary to the immediate interests of the Chamber of Mines and the mostinfluential financial groups supporting the Government, but fortunately general smuts is aware of the danger and took drastic action to crush an attempt by anumber of Government Members of Parliament to wreck the Insurance Bill.13. Of the other Ministers there seems no reason to modify the views expressed in the memorandum of the 27th May, 1940.14. Among private members on the Government side no one had muchopportunity to add to his reputation. Mr. Blackwell, an Australian-born lawyerin Johannesburg, as usual proved to be a pugnacious debater whose effectivenessis diminished by the provocative flaunting of rather jingoistic convictions. Thisis true despite the fact that his jingoism is of a milder order than the opposingjingoism of the Nationalist extremists. Mr. Leif Egeland, who, as a formerOxford don, has claims to mental distinction, proved a serious disappointment tothe Cabinet, some of whom had high hopes of him. He is not lacking inintelligence, but is conventional in outlook, and most unlikely to be the futureleader whom the English-speaking section has so far failed to produce. The littlegroup of Dominionites, with the exception of their leader, Colonel Stallard, once again showed themselves utterly unable to adapt themselves emotionally orintellectually (if the word is not out of place in this context) to a changingpolitical climate. Mr. Marwick, who is particularly purblind, wasted a greatdeal of the time of the House in futile motions and muck-raking enquiries, and did his best to wreck what reputation for political sense he may ever have had.15. The two Natives&apos; representatives had an effectiveness much beyond theirnumerical strength. (The third was absent through illness.) Committed to awhole-hearted support of the Government on the war issue, they had neverthelessample opportunity for constructive criticism of the Governments policy in socialquestions. Mrs. Ballinger emerged as the most successful of the private membersusually counted amongst the Governmenfs supporters. Her Parliamentaryability has notably increased since her entry into the House four years ago: shespeaks lucidly and attractively, has a firm grasp of principle and an expert
knowledge of economic and social matters. Few people realise the extent of herinfluence on Government departments or her substantial record of achievementbehind the scenes. (Mr. Sturrock&apos;s inclusion of non-Europeans in his Bill toestablish a pension scheme for casual labourers on the Railways was the directresult of a memorandum which she drafted.) Mr. Molteno has increased in confidence and is sound on economic matters affecting the natives, but he fails as yet to make any great impression on the House, partly, perhaps, because he isunduly sensitive to Opposition gibes, to which, of course, his position renders himparticularly subject.(b) The Opposition,16. If the Government and its supporters gave throughout the session a striking demonstration of unity in the prosecution of the war, the Oppositionhave never been so torn by dissensions and personal rivalries. The beginning ofthe session saw the revolt and secession of ten Hertzogite Members of Parliament,who could stomach no longer the racial intolerance and political extremism oftheir Malanite allies. Henceforth this rather forlorn little group, lacking a leader of any consequence or a policy of any wide appeal, fought a rancorous guerrillaaction against the Nationalist Party&apos;s flank, while maintaining nothing merethan a formal attitude of opposition to the Government&apos;s war policy. It wasinsistent in its exposure of the hollowness of the Nationalists&apos; claim to representa united Afrikanerdom. It attacked the Ossewa Brandwag as nothing but a&quot;big bluff,&quot; and went out of its way to compare General Smuts&apos;s chivalrousattitude towards General Hertzog with the scandalous treatment accordedGeneral Hertzog by Mr. Swart and his gang of saboteurs. The Nationalistsprofessed indifference to these attacks, but in their retorts betrayed everysymptom of an uneasy conscience. They have since appealed to the AfrikanerParty to&quot;return to the fold, but without success; and the party has now held acongress, at which a Transvaal party was formed in addition to the Free Stateparty established some months ago and Mr. Havenga has been elected leader.It is a thousand pities that he cannot be induced to re-enter the House, wherehis wide experience and liberal attitude of mind could hardly fail to exercise a beneficial effect. The present leader of the party, General Conroy. is so ineptthat it may be expected that the greatest pressure will be put on Mr. Havengato return to the Parliamentary arena. It is to be feared, however, that his loyalty to his old leader will prevent him from acceding to the wishes of his followers,unless perhaps General Hertzog should die.17. Mr. Pirow throughout the session proved a source of extreme embarrass-ment to his nominal leader and of some malicious satisfaction to the nationalist party&apos;s opponents. On the few occasions on which he deigned to find time fromhis strenuous evangel in the platteland to attend Parliament he adopted thepatronising pose of the man of destiny summoned from serious things to watch the little innocents at play. He spoke hardly at all, and did not even, as in theprevious session, lead the attack in the Defence debate. He was frequently to beseen in the lobbies and the refreshment rooms engaged in earnest cabal; and asnews of German victories arrived he did not trouble to conceal his satisfaction.As the session advanced the opposition to Mr. Pirow threw up a leader in mr. Strydom, the able leader of the party in the Transvaal, who found anunaccustomed weapon in the struggle against his rival in a public defence of democracy and the plain statement that the Afrikaner people would have notruck with imported systems of personal dictatorship. Mr. Pirow is clearlyentirely under the influence of Nazi philosophy and Hitler&apos;s conception of a&quot; new order &quot; in the world.18. The party is torn within by dissensions between those who franklydesire a German victory and&apos; the imposition of a Nazi system, upon this countryand the section of orthodox republicans who still fondly hope that a victoriousGermany would leave them with their national freedom, inspired by Voortrekkertraditions. This internal conflict by itself would have been enough to stretchDr. Malan&apos;s capacity for compromise to the breaking point. It was aggravated by the growing power of the Ossewa Brandwag, which cast its shadow across theparty and insolently threatened to use the sjambok on politicians who could not maintain the semblance of unity.  Thus rent by strife within and: weakened from
without, the party could not be expected to cut a very effective figure in itsparliamentary opposition to the Government. It was significant that Dr. Malan,in moving his motion of no confidence, was induced, no doubt by lack of material,to place the chief emphasis of his indictment on the Rand riots, which had takenplace after he had given notice of his motion. So feeble, in fact, was his bill of complaint that he laid himself open to the Prime Minister&apos;s devastating retortthat in a farrago of criticism and denunciations not one solid reason for lack ofconfidence in the Government had been advanced and that, in fact, it was onlytoo apparent that the Nationalists were not in a position to provide the country with an alternative administration.19. It should be said that the poor showing of the Nationalist Party duringthe session was not entirely due to lack of ability on the part of its members.Mr. Strydom, who has taken the place of Mr. Havenga as chief financial experton the Opposition benches, displayed, it is true, surprising ineptitude in hiscriticisms of Mr. Hofmeyr&apos;s policy : he was plainly the wrong man for the job,but there are others which he could do very well. The Opposition paid littleattention to purely military matters and Mr. Erasmus delivered himself of afew rather inconsequent pronouncements on the subject; but in the debates onthe Government^ electoral and census Bills he proved to be a penetrating andingenious critic. Mr. B. J. Schoeman, as prospective Minister of Labour in aNationalist Government, gave Mr. Madeley many awkward moments in the debate on the Factories Bill and succeeded in establishing his party as a serious candidate for the workers&apos; vote on the Rand. Mr. Strydom, Nationalist leader in the transvaal, confirmed his claim to be the strong man of the Party. He is afanatical republican, impatient of compromise, firmly set upon his course andpossessed of considerable ability. Mr. Eric Louw has a sharp tongue and a clearbrain : he once again gave proof of that bitter dislike of the English which henurtured during his sojourns in London and Paris. (It is an unfortunate factthat there are among Afrikaner Nationalists some who, because of self-mistrustfulnatures and a morbid sensitivity to anything which can be interpreted as a personal slight, are proof against the mellowing and liberalising influence of life in London.   Mr. Louw is one of these.)20. In general, it must be admitted that, excluding the Cabinet on the one side and the Opposition &quot; shadow cabinet &quot; on the other, private members of all parties display, with but few exceptions, an appalling spectacle of ineptitude.Even the present Cabinet is burdened with more &quot; dead wood &quot; than is desirable or even necessary, and in this respect the opposition &quot; shadow cabinet&quot; is as awhole superior in personal ability.21. Before leaving personalities, mention must be made of the Speaker.Once again he played his difficult role consummately. To him and to the clerk of the House must go, as has already been said, most of the credit for the delicateflowering of party co-operation. Unfortunately, Mr. Jansen&apos;s health gives riseto the gravest anxiety. Late last year he was found unconscious outside his house in Pretoria and, though he withstood the fatigues of the earlier portionof the Session, his physical condition deteriorated sadly towards the end and on one occasion he actually fainted in the chair, though his recovery was so swiftthat it is doubtful whether any of the members noticed the attack. Mr. Kilpinhad grave fears that Mr. Jansen would not be able to finish the Session, butthough the emergency passed, the future gives cause for alarm. ShouldMr. Jansen&apos;s health fail completely, he will be most difficult to replace, indeedthere seems to be an almost complete dearth of suitable candidates on either sideof the House. The present Chairman of Committees, Major G. B. van Zyl, has for long demonstrated his complete inability to handle the House and would be entirely unsuitable.(c) Legislation.22. This has been dealt with in telegrams and despatches and only a briefsummary is required.(i) Financial.23. The main interest of Mr. Hofmeyr&apos;s budget lay in his proposals toraise an additional  ^(Q^O^^i^ta^tion^ad-iB^^r^ihe comprehensive reforms
which he introduced into a taxation system that had remained fundamentallyunchanged since 1925. Even so, the burden borne by the South African income-taxpayer would be amazingly light in peace-time and in time of war is absurdlydisproportionate to comparable taxes in other belligerent countries. Not eventhe Nationalists could protest over much. Taxation of the gold mines was increased, but even when the very large proportion of the Union&apos;s revenue alreadyderived from direct or indirect taxes on the gold mines is taken into account,there was hardly anyone in the House who did not think that Mr. Hofmeyr hadlet them- off lightly. &quot; Mr. Hofmeyr has made provision for a war expenditure ofabout  72,000,000. It is generally believed that this figure will have to be raisedconsiderably before the end of the financial year.(ii) Social.24. The Government, at Mr. Madeley&apos;s instance, sponsored two Bills whichintroduce useful improvements in the conditions of employment of many thousands of (almost exclusively European) workers. The first was the Factories Bill, whichprescribes a maximum of a 46-hour week and conditions relating to over-time andother matters. The Opposition turned the second reading debate into a demonstration in favour of an industrial colour bar and a minimum wage of10/- a day for European workers in industry (excluding agriculture).Mr. Schoeman, who led the Opposition attack, made a series of apparentlyelectioneering speeches addressed more to the workers in the large towns than tothe House.25. The Workmen&apos;s Compensation Bill, which had its second readingwithout a division, was strongly opposed by the insurance companies :Mr. Madeley complained in Parliament about &quot; the inordinate amount of lobby-ing, canvassing and intrigue &quot; that had taken place. As has already been said,Mr. Pocock and others on the Government side made no secret of their distrustof the principle of State insurance, but they did not press their opposition.Certain members opposite who represent the growing power of Afrikanercapitalism were also known to be opposed to the Bill, but discreetly followed the Party in its support of the measure.(iii) Electoral.26. Mr. Lawrence secured the passage of two Bills which made provisionfor the enumeration in the census and registration as voters of persons on active service; and for soldiers to vote in the field when general elections for parliament or the Provincial Councils are held. The significance of these measures is that south African soldiers, whether in or outside the Union, will be able to vote inthe Provincial Council elections which take place next February, and which willbe fought mainly on the war issue, and in the Parliamentary election which isdue in two years&apos; time. The Opposition not inaptly complained that the Govern-ment was turning the army into &apos;&apos; a voting factory for the United Party.&apos;&apos; Theywere specially perturbed about the prospect of large numbers of coloured men now in military service obtaining the necessary financial qualifications to vote asa result of their military pay. An interesting constitutional innovation is that soldiers will vote, not for individual candidates (whose names they might not even know), but for parties.(iv) Asiatic Land Tenure.27. The Government, after many years&apos; delay, secured the passage of theFeetham Resolutions, which exempt certain areas in the Transvaal from thei^estrictions imposed by the Gold Law upon occupation and ownership of landby Asiatics.28. Parliament has been prorogued until August 27th. This date willprobably be changed to one rather later in the year. General Smuts recentlyexpressed the view that the session would be resumed towards the end ofSeptember.United Kingdom High Commissioners Office,Pretoria, May 29, 1941.
