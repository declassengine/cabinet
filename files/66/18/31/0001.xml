.CYPHER    TELEGRAM.Prom     Dominions Office,To        Prime Minister of Commonwealth of Australia.,fient 9.15 n,m. 29th August, 1941.IMMEDIATE.No. 607 SECRET.    Following from prime MINISTER TO PRIME MINISTER begins:SECRET.1.     Now that you have taken up your great office i send you my most cordial good wishes for euccess, andassure you that I and my colleagues will do everything in our power to work with you in the same spirit ofcomradeship and goodwill as we worked with Mr. Menzies,who we are so glad to see is serving under you asMinisterfor the Co-ordination of Defence,2.     We have followed attentively the difficultieswhich have arisen in Australia about your representationover here, and perhaps it will be a help if I let you seeour side of the question and how we are situated.5.      Since the declarations of the ImperialConference of 1926 embodied in the Statute of Westminsterall Dominion Governments are equal in status to that ofthe Mother Country, and all have direct access to theCrown.      The Cabinet of His Majestyfs Government of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland, of which at present I havethe honour to be the head, is responsible to our own&apos;Parliament and is appointed by the King because theypossess a majority in the House of Commons.      It wouldnot be possible therefore without organic changes, about which all the Dominions would have to be consulted, to.make an Australian Minister who is responsible to the

Commonwealth Legislature a member of our tody.      the precedent of General Smuts in the last war does notapply, because he was an integral member of the War cabinet of those days appointed by The King because of his personalaptitudes and not because he represented the South Africanor Dominions point of view.4.      In practice, however, whenever a Dominion PrimeMinister visits this country - and they cannot visit ittoo often or too long - he is always invited to sit with us and take a full part in our deliberations*  -  This is-because he is the head of the Government of one of oursister Dominions,  engaged with us in the common struggle,-and has presumably the power to speak with the authorityof the Dominion concerned not only on instructions from home but upon many issues which may arise in the course ofdiscussion.      This is a great advantage to us, and speedsup business.5.      The position of a Dominion Minister other thanPrime Minister would be very different, as he would notbe a principal but only an envoy.      Many Dominions,Ministers other than Prime Ministers have visited us from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africaduring the present war,  and I am always ready to confer with them or put them in the closest touch with theMinisters of the various Departments with which they.areconcerned.      In the normal course the Secretary of Statefor the Dominions and the High Commissioner for theDominion concerned look after them, and secure them every facility     for doing any work they may have to do.     Thisarrangement has given satisfaction, so far as I am aware,to all concerned.-2-.

6.      I have considered the suggestion that each ofthe Dominions should have a Minister other than thePrime Minister sitting with us in the Cabinet of theUnited Kingdom during this time of war.      I have learntfrom the Prime Ministers    of the Dominions of Canada,South Africa and New Zealand that they do not desiresuch representation and are well content with our present arrangements.      Some of the Dominion Prime ministers have indeed taken a very strongly adverse view, holdingthat no one but the Prime Minister can speak for their governments except as specifically instructed, and thatthey might find their own liberty of action prejudiced by any decisions,some of which have to be made very quickly in wartime, to which their Minister became a party.7.      Prom our domestic point of view as HisMajesty&apos;s Servants in the United Kingdom, there are many difficulties.      We number at present eight, and therehas been considerable argument that we should not bemore than five.     The addition of four dominion representatives would involve the retirement from theWar Cabinet of at least an equal number of british ministers.     Dwelling within a parliamentary anddemocratic system we rest like you do upon a politicalbasis.     I should not myself feel able, as at presentadvised, to recommend to His Majesty either the additionof four Dominions Ministers to the Cabinet of the UnitedKingdom, which would make our numbers too large for business, or the exclusion of a number of my presentcolleagues who are the leading men in the political parties to which they belong.

8.      If of course you desire to send anyone   from australia as a special envoy to discuss any particularaspect of our common war effort, we should of coursewelcome him with the utmost consideration and honour, huthe would not he and could not he a responsible partnerin the daily work of our Government.9.      His relationship with the existing HighCommissioner for Australia and with the Secretary ofState for the Dominions would be for you to decide.    Itwould seem, however, if fluch an envoy remained here as a regular institution, that the existing functions of theHigh Commissioner would to some extent be duplicated,and the relations of the Secretary of State with theHigh Commissioners generally might be affected.      such difficulties are not insuperable, but they may as well be faced.      The whole system of the work of the high commissioners in daily oontact with the Secretary ofState for the Dominions, has worked well, and I amassured that the three other Dominions would be opposedto any change.10.     We should of course welcome a meeting ofDominion Prime Ministers if that could be arranged, butthe difficulties of distance and occasion are as you know very great.       We are also quite ready to consider,if you desire it,  the question of the formation of an imperial War Cabinet.      So far-reaching a change couldnot however be brought about piecemeal, but only by thegeneral wish of all the Governments now serving HisMajesty. Winston Churchill.      Ends.29th August, 1941.
