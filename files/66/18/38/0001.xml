THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1941.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (41) 215.September 6, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.MEXICO.Resumption of Diplomatic Relations and Settlement of the Oil Dispute.1. I WILL not trouble my colleagues with even a compressed story of how the expropriation by Senor Cardenas&apos;s Government of the foreign oil companies in the spring of 1938 led to the breaking off of diplomatic relations between the mexican Government and ourselves, but not between the former and the UnitedStates Government. The latter, however, kept the dispute open, and, as longas they did so, we, for our part, had two valuable cards : (i) there remained thepossibility of the American Government confronting the Mexican Governmentjointly with ourselves; and (ii) the American oil companies, realising that theirbargaining position was greatly enhanced by a solid front with our own companies,and fearing that their Government would force an unsatisfactory settlement on them, have (with one exception) loyally and firmly maintained the Anglo-Americanfront.2. An American-Mexican settlement would therefore leave us practicallywithout cards. Not only that, but a large American loan to Mexico (out of whichthe American Oil Companies would indirectly be compensated) would help the mexican Government to overcome many of the difficulties they are now findingin operating the Mexican Eagle fields. It was the imminence of such an arrange-ment, including a settlement imposed on the American Oil Companies, that ledme to tell the War Cabinet on the 28th August that I felt that we ought to take such steps as we could to obtain terms for our own Oil Companies not less goodthan those which the American Companies would be having to accept, and thatin this connexion we should aim at the resumption of diplomatic relations withthe Mexican Government.3. That morning I had informed the American Ambassador that we had instructed our Embassy in Washington to tell Mr. Welles for his own information that we were now prepared to consider favourably the resumption of diplomatic relations with Mexico. I said that we hoped for the good offices of the UnitedStates Government in the negotiations which would ensue with the mexican government about oil and other matters, and I expressed the hope that theAmerican and British oil companies might be able to negotiate jointly. I didnot expressly say that our desire to consider favourably the resumption of relations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Afairs.11481   [22896]
was conditional upon the United States Government fulfilling our hopes on thetwo points, nor upon the Mexican Government giving indications of their readiness for a reasonably satisfactory settlement of their dispute with the british oil companies. Two of my colleagues have now indicated to me their feeling that what I said to Mr. Winant sounded like a proposal to renew relations with Mexicounconditionally, without providing for a reasonable settlement of the oil dispute,and that they consider this imprudent.4. I will not trouble my colleagues with the details of a more conditionalcourse preferred by the Petroleum Department which was telegraphed to our embassy in Washington and which made our readiness to resume relationssubject to certain assistance from the United States Government and certainassurances from the Mexican Government. Our Embassy&apos;s comment on thiswas :&quot; We shall .... have to be careful, in making our representations, toavoid creating the impression that under the guise of concession to UnitedStates point of view we are endeavouring to sabotage, for our own purely british reasons, conclusion of an agreement between the United StatesGovernment and Mexican Government, which we know the former regardsas very necessary from the point of view of their own defence.&quot;5. On renewed consideration of this course I felt clear that the UnitedStates Government would regard it as bound to bring the oil dispute back verymuch to the old deadlock from which Mr. Welles has been labouring long toremove it; and that, if we pressed them, they would suspect a rather inept effort on our part to sabotage their agreement. The United States Government feelno great obligation to consider our feelings in this matter in view of our dilatori-ness (as they see it) to make the advances they have long been urging us to make to .the Mexican Government.6. Ministry of Economic Warfare and Department of Overseas trade for their own reasons both desire resumption of relations with Mexico. I think,however, they would agree that our principal gain will consist in getting the goodwill of the United States Government. We are asking much of them, andwe shall be asking more in parts of the world where we consider our interestsprimary. There is no doubt that the United States Government believe thatimproved relations between Great Britain and Mexico will make their ownproblem with Mexico more tractable; and the degree of United States Govern-ment response to our demands elsewhere may very legitimately be affected by our own response to their wishes as regards the large unruly country on theirsouthern boundary.7. In this situation I feared that&apos; it would be useless to ask the United StatesGovernment to suspend an important part of their imminent settlement or tomake our readiness to resume relations with Mexico conditional upon either a promise from the United States Government to give us their help, or again to emphasize that we will not renew relations until a satisfactory settlement of the oil dispute on such and such lines is in sight. It is unpleasant to have to tie our hands by any unconditional promise, and to have to trust to receive such assistance as the United States may be disposed to give us. But I feel they will be moredisposed to give it to us if we make this gesture than if we try to put an obstaclein their path which they will almost certainly brush aside. We shall not deflecttheir policy and we shall only be left with a legacy of ill-will and no disposition to give us help.8. I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that the next step should be forthe Embassy in Washington to approach the State Department in the sense ofmy communication to Mr. Winant (see paragraph 3 above), and to ask theState Department to give us all the information they can as to the kind of settlement which they are imposing on the American companies, including theextent to which the latter will be allowed to negotiate with the Mexican Govern-ment direct. The Embassy should press again, and strongly, that it would be most unwise and unfair to compel the companies to give up all control over theiioil-fields. This is of great importance as we still hope that our companies maybe associated with such negotiations.  I annex first a telegram from His Majesty&apos;s
ANNEX I.Mr. Gainer to Foreign Office.(No. 135.  Immediate.  Secret.) Caracas, August 28, 1941.YOUR telegram No. 157.Venezuelan economic life is at this moment entirely dependent uponproduction and sale of oil, and the Government are using every possible meansof increasing their revenue from this source. They are urging the companies toincrease their production and are considering the means of altering the existingconcessions laws with a view to a further increase of revenue. The widening ofthe margin, between oil dollar and commercial dollar has provided them with additional revenue at the expense of the oil companies, and there is also someagitation for nationalisation of local sales of oil products and refining as a furthermeans of increasing income from the natural riches of the country. Unofficialcircles have also recommended imposition of export tax.2. Thus Venezuelan Government would now certainly take no action to restrict the output or cut down our supplies and would, indeed, be only too glad to increase them. Nevertheless, if they suspect that resumption of relations withMexico could result in a transfer of any part of our purchases from Venezuela toMexico they would be seriously alarmed, and may take some action on the lines indicated above, which though not prejudicial to our immediate supplies, wouldbe most unwelcome to the companies, though it would certainly stop short ofmaking it impossible for the companies to continue to work here.3. For this reason it should be made quite clear that we intend at leastduring the war to maintain our present level of purchases of Venezuelan oil. Itmight be possible to give an assurance of this to Venezuelan Government, but thiswould have to be carefully Worded as they would wish to make it public eitherto forestall or to counteract newspaper agitation, and regard would also have to Nbe paid to the effect of such a statement upon Mexican susceptibilities.4. Venezuelan Government, of course, envisage the possibility of Mexicore-entering market at some future date, but at this particular juncture nothing could be more prejudicial to this country.5. While then in the short run I would not anticipate trouble, in the long-run my view is less favourable for reasons given in my telegram No. 10 of17th January, but only in regard to the effect upon the oil companies in the future and not upon our immediate requirements.(Repeated to Washington.)Minister in Venezuela which shows that our fears as to the possible effects inVenezuela of resuming relations with Mexico have been much exaggerated; and,secondly, a letter from the United States Minister in London to Sir A. Cadoganwhich shows that our indication of our readiness to resume relations is servingto restrain Mr. Hull from making an announcement covering an oil settlement.9. On learning from the Embassy details as to the kind of oil settlementthat the United States Government have in mind, we shall be able to judge what our next step should be on behalf of the companies.September 6, 1941.
ANNEX II.Mr. Herschel Johnson to Sir A. Cadogan.(Confidential.) Embassy of the United States of America,Dear Alec: v      London, September 5, 194l.I REFER to our meeting on the 2nd September when I showed you atelegram the Ambassador had received from the Secretary of State in regardto the possible resumption of relations between Great Britain and Mexico.This telegram was in reply to one the Ambassador had sent to Washingtonfollowing a talk with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in which mr. Eden had told him of his plans in connection with Mexico.Mr. Hull states in his telegram under reference that he had spoken with the mexican Ambassador. The Ambassador had informed him once again that the mexican Government would be happy to renew diplomatic relations with GreatBritain, and suggested as the most satisfactory manner of bringing this about that, after preliminary discussions between His Majesty&apos;s Charge dAffaires atWashington and himself, the Governments of Great Britain and Mexico should merely announce simultaneously the appointment of diplomatic representatives in London and in Mexico City, respectively. The Mexican Ambassador statedthat his Government is fully disposed to assure His Majesty&apos;s Government thatthe British oil interests in Mexico will be given treatment as favorable as that given to the American oil interests. Mr. Hull informed Sir Ronald Campbellto this effect, and suggested to him that he arrange to see the Mexican ambassador in order that they might deal directly with each other on these questions.Mr. Hull requested Mr. Winant to inform the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs that the Department of State will be more than glad to facilitate in every possible way the early resumption of relations between Great Britain and Mexico.Mr. Hull says that he fully agrees that diplomatic relations should be resumedbefore any announcement be made regarding oil policies. This suggestion had originally been made to Mr. Winant by Mr. Eden. Mr. Hull says further,however, that he feels sure Mr. Eden will understand that, because of theimportance of relations between the United States and Mexico, the announcementof certain preliminary agreements which he hopes may soon be arrived at betweenthe United States and Mexico cannot be long postponed. He therefore earnestlyhopes that an agreement may be reached promptly for the resumption betweenGreat Britain and Mexico of diplomatic relations.Mr. Hull&apos;s telegram under reference was shown by Mr. Winant to the PrimeMinister and to Mr. Eden on the 31st August.Yours ever,HERSCHEL JOHNSON.
