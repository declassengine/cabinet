THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1941.W.P. (41) 220.September 16, 1941.SECRET.Copy No:TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.FAR EASTERN POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 24th August the Prime Minister, referring in his broadcast to themenace created by Japan&apos;s latest expansionist activities, said: &quot;It is certainthat this has got to stop.&quot; He added that, if the efforts of the United States tobring about an amicable settlement in the Far East should fail, &apos;&apos; we shall, ofcourse, range ourselves unhesitatingly at the side of the United States.&quot; Theimmediate point for decision. is whether it is necessary or desirable to addanything to these statements.2. The attached note describes in detail our consultations with the UnitedStates on the subject of a warning to Japan. The position is as follows : At the atlantic meeting, President Roosevelt declared his intention of giving a warningin words which, in the event, he did not use. His actual warning did not make itclear, as had been the original object, that war with the United States might bethe result of further Japanese moves. On the other hand, its scope was widenedbeyond the south-west Pacific and the wording was deliberately chosen to meetthe suspicions of China and Russia that they were being left out. It seemedadvisable, in any parallel action on our part, to adhere to the wording agreedupon at the Atlantic meeting, but the United States Government have made itclear that, while they do not want us specifically to link up our warning withtheirs, they would prefer us to adopt wording as wide as that which they had used; and (while attaching less importance to this point) they have suggestedthat express mention of the word &quot;war&quot; should be avoided. (Field-marshal smuts also doubted the advisability of a warning on the original lines, andespecially the use of the word &quot;war.&quot;)3. There is force in the United States contention that the Far East shouldbe treated comprehensively and that the Japanese should not be led to think, by a warning applying to one sector of the front (e.g., the south-west Pacific), thatthey need fear no reactions from us if they attack in another sector (e.g., Russia).It is certainly true that the Japanese are likely to be deterred from any action ifthey believe that such action would meet with united opposition from the UnitedStates, Russia and ourselves. Nevertheless, I am doubtful of the value or the wisdom of a warning on our part, at this time, at once so wide and so vague asthe United States have given. It could not, in any event, be given without further consultation with the Dominions and the Dutch, who would certainly scrutiniseits implications closely before agreeing. This alone appears to rule it out as animmediate measure.11486   [22916]
4. I recommend, therefore, that we drop the idea of a further warning to Japan, at all events until after a further review of our whole Far Easternpolicy, with particular reference to the action, if any, which we should feel ableto take in the event of an attack by Japan on Russia or of a new attack on China.I hope very shortly to circulate a paper on this subject.5. If this recommendation is adopted it will be necessary, after consulting the Dominions, to communicate bur decision to the United States &quot;Government.To base that decision on the ground that the United States warning covers Chinaand Russia and goes therefore further than we are prepared to go would be undesirable. It Would be better to take the line that on reflection we feel that a warning from us in the more general terms suggested by the United States would add nothing to the Prime Ministers broadcast and might even detract fromits force. That broadcast has made clear both our attitude towards Japan&apos;sexpansionist policy and our complete support of the United States, and has, we feel sure, been taken by the Japanese Government as the complement of the UnitedStates warning. We think it better therefore to let the matter rest there unlessevents show the need for something more.6. I suggest that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs be asked toobtain the concurrence of the Dominion Governments in a communication to theUnited States Government on the above lines.A. E.Foreign Office, September 16, 1941.
ANNEX.Proposed Warning to Japan as to the Consequences of Further Encroachments:BOTH the Secretary of State and Mr. Cor dell Hull on the 6th August made/ statements indicating that Japanese domination of Thailand would menace thev security of our respective possessions. It was pointed out in various quarters,however, that what was wanted in order to deter Japan was something whichwould indicate unmistakably that a Japanese incursion into Thailand might leadto war with ourselves and the United States. Representations in this sense madeby the Thai Government were strongly supported by Sir J. Crosby, andSir R. Craigie also advised that, whatever our attitude was, we should leave theJapanese Government in no doubt about it. He strongly endorsed Sir J. Crosby&apos;splea for a joint public declaration of the importance attached by the United Statesand ourselves to the complete independence of Thailand, and said that nothing but a very determined attitude on the part of the United States, the netherlands and ourselves had any chance of deterring the Japanese military authorities frompushing things to extremes.,2. Previous to the statements of the 6th August, referred to above, instruc-tions were sent to Lord Halifax to propose to the United States Governmentparallel warnings to Japan, going as far as possible to indicate that any furtherJapanese penetration into Thailand or elsewhere (we had in mind the netherlands east Indies) would provoke action on the part of the United States and ourselves.3. The Defence Committee on the 9th August telegraphed to the PrimeMinister that there was a growing feeling in this country that the only hopeof preventing Thailand from ultimately sharing the fate of Indo-China was aplain warning by ourselves, and a fortiori by the United States and ourselvestogether, that this would lead to war. The Defence Committee recognised thata blunt warning that we would regard a further Japanese move into Thailandas a casus belli might in itself be too challenging; but their unanimous view wasthat the situation would best be met by parallel warnings by the United Statesand ourselves, delivered strictly privately to the Japanese Government throughthe diplomatic channel, to the effect that any incursion by Japanese forces intoThailand would produce a situation in which we should be compelled to takecounter-measures likely to lead to war between our respective countries and Japan.4. During the Atlantic meeting, the President agreed to send a note to theJapanese Ambassador including the following passage : &quot; Any further encroach-ment by Japan in the south-west Pacific would produce a situation in which theUnited States Government would be compelled to take counter-measures, eventhough these might lead to war between the United States and Japan.&quot; ThePresident said he would also add something to the effect that it was obvious that,the Soviet Union being a friendly Power, the United States Government wouldbe similarly interested in any conflict in the north-west Pacific.5. The Prime Minister authorised the President to inform the JapaneseGovernment that His Majesty&apos;s Government were in complete accord with themin this matter and would collaborate fully.6. On the Presidents return to the United States he communicated a,\ memorandum to the Japanese Ambassador which departed from the wording/&quot; quoted above. The memorandum related to J apanese action in Indo-China andclosed with a warning in the following terms : &quot; This Government now finds itnecessary to say to the Government of Japan that, if the Japanese Governmenttakes any further steps in pursuance of a policy or programme of militarydomination by force or threat of force of neighbouring countries, the Governmentof the United States will be compelled to take any or all the steps which it may deem necessary towards safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of theUnited States and American nationals, and towards ensuring the safety and security of the United States.&quot;   This memorandum was communicated to the
Japanese Ambassador on the 17th August. There was no direct reference to thenorth-west Pacific and no indication that His Majesty&apos;s Government shared theview of the United States Government.7. On the 24th August the Prime Minister made a broadcast in which he made it clear that Japanese expansionist policy had got to stop, and that if theefforts of the United States to bring about a settlement in the Far East shouldfail, we should range ourselves at the side of the United States.8. On the 27th August His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Washington was informedthat, even after the Prime Ministers broadcast, we still felt it desirable that,apart from our support of the United States, we should, in the interests of thesecurity of our own territories, be compelled to take counter-measures in theevent of further Japanese expansion. We should, however, prefer to adhere tothe wording of the warning elaborated at the Atlantic meeting, and we suggestedtwo alternative formulae which we might use according to whether or not theUnited States saw objection to our warning being linked specifically to that givenby the United States Government.   The two formulae were as follows :  Formula 1.His Majesty&apos;s Government are aware of uhe communication which president roosevelt made to the Japanese Ambassador on the 17th August regarding, the concern of the United States at Japanese military activities in Indo-China andthe steps which the United States Government would be compelled to take if theJapanese Government pursued a similar policy in regard to neighbouring countries. His Majesty&apos;s Government share the concern of the United StatesGovernment and cannot disregard the plain threat to the security of british territories which such a policy on the part of Japan would constitute.His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, who have for their part no aggressiveintentions either against the countries bordering on British territories or against japan herself, feel it necessary, in the interests of peace, to let the JapaneseGovernment know that any further Japanese encroachment in the south-west pacific area would compel His Majesty&apos;s Government to take counter-measures,even though these might lead to war between Great Britain and Japan.Formula 2,His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have watched with grave concern the successive encroachments of the Japanese armed forces in Indo-Chinaand the accumulating evidence of an intention on the part of the JapaneseGovernment to continue this policy of expansion by force, or threat of force, intocountries bordering on British territories. They cannot disregard the plain threat to the security of those territories which such a policy would constitute.His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore, who have for their part no aggressiveintentions either against these countries or against Japan herself, feel that thetime has come for the most complete candour. Tbey accordingly find it necessary,in the interests of peace, to let the Japanese Government know that any furtherJapanese encroachment in the south-west Pacific area would compel His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to take counter-measures, even though these might lead to war between Great Britain and Japan.9. The United States Government have now made it clear that they would prefer us to avoid mention of their warning. They have further suggested(a) that the word &quot; war &quot; should be avoided and (b) that our warning should notrelate solely to the south-west Pacific area, but should be made more broadly and take the form of a warning against the continuance of the war and expansionpolicy and programme of conquest by force. Mr. Hull explained that the UnitedStates formula had been expressly adopted to meet possible suspicion by Chinaand Russia that they were being left out.
