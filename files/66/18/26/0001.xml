The First Lord of the Admiralty to the Prime Minister.(Abbey No. 19, despatched 4-2 p.m., 8th August.)Following from First Lord : &apos; From recent attacks on Gibraltar and Sierra Leone convoys it appears that -the enemy is concentrating his submarines on these routes.-.2. This is very probably due to the interest now displayed by the U.S.A.in the Trans-Atlantic convoys when in Western part of the Atlantic and the factthat Germans are very reluctant even to risk an incident with the U.S.A.3. These convoys must now be escorted throughout their route and we cannotprovide adequate escort, particularly destroyer escort, until some of our forces are released from the Western Ocean.4. The above considerations point to the importance of the U.S.A. puttingWestern Hemisphere Defence Plan No. 4 into full operation as soon as possible.1602B/8..\     .      &apos;  &apos;       (2)The Prime Minister of Australia to the Prime Minister.(Abbey No. 20, despatched 8-50 p.m., 8th August.)Following from Menzies : Delighted to know this meeting between yourself and Roosevelt is takingplace. It will have a stimulating effect all over the world. You will, I think,have a great opportunity of influencing his mind in the direction of dramaticaction. My own impression in America was that the natural process of developing public opinion had gone about as far as it would, and that the next stage depended on Roosevelt whose personal prestige would give him a majorityfor any vigorous course. If this is right, you of all men can give him what heneeds. I hope that you will seize the opportunity not only to deal with the atlantic and European problems, but also clarify the Far East position. I do notthink that there is any doubt that a firm and unequivocal attitude by the UnitedStates is the one thing that will deter Japan from continuing on a course leading to war. If Japan enters the war or by threats to our vital interests compels theBritish Empire into war, the effect upon the disposition of Australian forces ofall arms may be far-reaching, and certainly you would have a naval problem ofthe gravest character. The Far East position is thus seen not as a remoteincidental matter, but as crucial and intimate. On this matter also I foundRoosevelt extremely sympathetic but reluctant to be too precise. And yetprecision and firmness are the real antidote to Japan. I am sure that you havethese matters in mind, but I just want you to know that in Australia and no doubtNew Zealand these aspects Of your decisions will be closely watched and the outcome most anxiously awaited.  Kindest regards and good wishes.2050B/8.(3)   ,The Prime Minister to the First Lord of the Admiralty, in reply to telegram No. (1).(Tudor No. 10, despatched 11-1 a.m., 9th August, received 6-37 p.m., 9th August.)Following from Prime Minister for First Lord : Your Abbey No. 19 O.K. ------r .......... ;.V::noiz/9.[22816]
dth (4)August.The Lord Privy Seal to the Prime Minister.(This telegram was despatched as a result of D.O. (41), 5Gth Meeting, Minute 3.)(Abbey No. 23, despatched 6-15 p.m., 9th August.)Following from Deputy Chairman, Defence Committee : Defence Committee have had under consideration situation in Siam.2. It is possible that in consequence of U.S. and British reactions to move into Indo-China and to present threats to Siam, Japan may now pause to consoli-date in Indo-China before taking next step, and that during interval she maycontent herself with economic penetration in Siam. But there is growing feelinghere that only hope of preventing Siam from ultimately sharing fate of Indo-China, is plain warning by ourselves, and a fortiori by ourselves and the U.S.A.-together, that this will lead to war. Neither U.S. nor we have yet gone further than to indicate that Japanese move into Siam would be a menace to security ofour respective possessions.3. Blunt warning that we would regard further Japanese move into Siamas casus belli might in itself be too challenging, and obviously goes beyond whatU.S. Government could constitutionally say. Moreover we ourselves should notnecessarily regard Japanese move into North or East Siam as constituting such adirect threat to our own interests as Japanese attempt to occupy Kra Isthmus.4. Defence Committee are unanimous in the view that situation would best be met by parallel warnings by U.S. and ourselves delivered strictly privately tothe Japanese Government through the diplomatic channel to the effect that anyincursion by Japanese forces into Siam would produce a situation in which weshould be compelled to take counter-measures likely to lead to war between our respective countries and Japan.5. We greatly hope that you will approve and be able to obtain PresidentPoosevelfs agreement to this course of action. Japanese have one eye on theNorth and are unlikely to take further steps southwards if it is clear that these will lead to war with U.S. as well as ourselves.6. There remains the question whether, if U.S. find themselves unable to deliver warning of this nature, it should be given by ourselves alone (in concert,of course, with Dominions). Discussion on this point in Defence Committee hasshown that question of warning turns on fundamental question whether we should,or should not, immediately fight Japan if she were to attempt to occupy the KraIsthmus. On this major question opinion in Defence Committee is at presentdivided. On the one hand it is argued that inadequacy of our forces, moreparticularly naval, makes it necessary to avoid war with Japan for as long aspossible unless we are certain of U.S. support. Th is is the view of the Chiefs ofStaff. According to this view, even if Japan forestalled us in the Kra Peninsula,we should in the absence of U.S. support be wise to accept position without going to war for the time being. Any warning to Japan would, therefore, be bluff7. Against this it is argued that it does not lie with us whether war can be averted; initiative is with Japan, and we can only do our best to deter her bywarning. But whether we warn her or not, we cannot afford to let Japanestablish herself without opposition in Kra Isthmus, where she would have bestjumping off ground for heavy attack on Singapore at moment most favourable to herself. Occupation of the Kra Isthmus could, in fact, have no other objectthan ultimate attack on Singapore, and threat would be so plain that we shouldhave no choice but to fight. Opinion in this country and in Australia and NewZealand would accept no other course, and our prestige in the East would notsurvive refusal. A sharp and bold reaction tb Japanese move would, moreover,win sympathy in the U.S. and would be more likely to bring U.S. to our aid )than anything else.8. Whether a warning is issued or not, Defence Committee is agreed thatif Japanese advance is confined to Northern Siam, we should at once advance toSingora without starting hostilities.9. We should be grateful for your guidance, in order that we may be in aposition&apos; to act before your return if the situation should demand it.
9th 10.   Meanwhile, Chiefs of Staff are instructing Commander-in-Chief, FarAugust.      East, to complete his preparations for a rapid move to Singora : (a) In the event of the entry of Japanese forces into Northern Siam; or    ;(b) To forestall an attempt by the Japanese to occupy the Kra Isthmus.He is being specifically warned that he should not attack Japanese forcesapproaching Siam, or cross Siamese frontier, without authority from home.1815B/9.10thAugust.(5)The Chiefs of Staff Committee to the First Sea Lord, with reference to telegram No. ($).(Sloane No. 6, despatched 6-12 p.m., $th August.)Following from Chiefs of Staff for First Sea Lord :- &quot;Reference paragraphs 4 and 10 of telegram No. Abbey 23 from DefenceCommittee.If this is discussed we suggest question might be raised whether UnitedStates, even if they had not felt able to join us in any warning, would in this event support British resistance to any attempt on the part of Japan to occupyKra Isthmus.1812B/9.(6)Sir Alexander Cadogan to the Foreign Office.(Tudor No.  14,  despatched 8-31  p.m.,  10th  August,  received  3-49  a.m.,ll^A August.)Following for Foreign Office from Sir A. Cadogan : In the course of conversations yesterday Mr. Sumner Welles said just before leaving Washington he was approached by Brazilian Ambassador, who complainedmost bitterly regarding our attitude on the question of enemy shipping inBrazilian control. Mr. Welles begged us to avoid as far as possible furtherantagonising Brazil, in which he saw grave danger.He is particularly careful of Brazilian susceptibilities at this moment as u..S. and Brazilian Staff are having talks on Hemisphere Defence, involving use by Brazil of a base in Surinam and employment of a Token Brazilian force, incase of need, for defence of Azores if that would make it easier for portuguese government.Can I say anything to reassure him.2031Z/10,(7)llth The First Sea Lord to the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Vice-Chief of Naval Staff, with august. reference to telegrams Nos. (1) and (3).(Avenue No. 17, despatched 12-47 a.m., llth August, received 10-57 a.m.,12th August)- Personal following for First Lord and V.C.N.S. : (a) It has been decided that plan No. 4 will be fully executed as soon asUnited States and Iceland (C) Flagships can be collected, loaded and distributed in order that British convoys can (? join) them. It is estimated that full plan willbe in operation about 1st September.(b) C.N.O. will inform C.N.S. when various units of British escort shipscan be withdrawn from Western Atlantic area.(c) From now onwards, U.S. ships will protect convoy routes from North. 4   America against surface raiders, and H.M.S. Revenge should be withdrawn assoon as practicable.(d) Please give copy of this to Admiral Ghormley.,   . 0047Z/11.
llthAugust.[Sloane No. 18, despatched 3-42 p.m., llth August.)Following for Sir A. Cadogan from Foreign Office :--Your telegram No. 14, Tudor (llth August : Enemy ships in Brazilianports).1. My two immediately following telegrams Sloane Nos. 19 and 20* arerepeats of telegrams from and to Rio de Janeiro, which show the latest position.They have both been repeated to Washington.2. As background you will remember that we have agreed with the TJ.S.to waive our belligerent rights to capture ex-enemy ships taken over by the IT.S.and transferred to a neutral flag. This we did in view of fact that this action was taken for our ultimate benefit. We have also let Mr. Welles know that we will similarly waive our rights with respect to vessels in S. American portsas soon as Mr. Welles&apos; Inter-American Financial Committee has agreed upon ajoint American scheme for their use. (It is anticipated that such a scheme would provide for the use of the ships in inter-American trade, thus freeing a smaller number of other vessels for trade in Anglo-U.S. interest.)3. In the above circumstances we do not see how we can go much further to meet the Brazilians. Mr. Welles&apos; Committee has been six weeks withoutproducing their anticipated resolution and we are only waiting for them, but itwould be fatal to our whole position in this matter to make a unilateral waiverto. the Brazilians without any face-saving concession by them whatever. Weshould be most pleased to consider any solution which Mr. Welles can suggestwhich will maintain our position. It may be, however, that concession in our telegram No. 371 to Rio will already have reassured Brazilian Government asto our intentions.--&apos; 4. As regards latter telegram it should be explained that British firms haveembargoed various of these ships for debt. We are making no difficulties about this as you see.5. As regards Norderney this ship has a large cargo of rubber, and it is ofthe utmost importance that she should not succeed in running the blockade.State Department have joined with us in representing strongly to the brazilian government that she should not be allowed to sail.(Sloane No. 19, despatched 3-45 p.m., llth August.)Following for Sir A. Cadogan from Foreign Office: Following is repeat of telegram No. 357 from Rio de Janeiro, dated31st July : &quot; My telegram No. 354.&apos;&apos; Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me to-day that he has reached agreement on the lines of British disiderata expressed to Washington Committeefor the purchase of two of the five German ships, and that the Germans have referred to Berlin willingness to buy the Montevideo by payment into a blockedaccount of balance of price after the ship&apos;s British debt has been paid in freecurrency. The Windhuk would be detained (as also Montevideo if agreement onthe above lines were not reached) until the two other ships had been handed overto the Brazilians. Minister for Foreign Affairs was confident that the president would then agree to the final detention of these ships and intern their, crews.Quid pro quo would be to allow Norderney to sail, which, in accordance with hispromise to me, he had always hitherto refused on: the grounds that some of the crew had taken illegal flight.   He asked my views.   I told him His Majesty&apos;s1542A/11.* Telegrams Nos. (9) and (10).
(11)The Prime Minister to the Lord Privy Seal.(Tudor No.  15,  despatched  1-50 p.m.,   llth  August,  received  12-4 a.m.,12th August)Prime Minister to Lord Privy Seal :-Have reached satisfactory settlement about naval plan 4, as already reportedto Admiralty.*Secondly, President is prepared to make very helpful action correspondingwith or consequent upon operation Pilgrim.Thirdly, he intends to negotiate with Japan on basis of a moratoriumfor, say, a month, during which no further military movements are to be madeby Japan in Indo-China and no encroachment upon Siam. He has agreed to end his communication v^ith a very severe warning, which I drafted, that furtherencroachment either in the south or north of the Pacific will be met by countermeasures which may lead to war between Japan and USA.   With this we- * Telegram No. (7).ilth Government attached the greatest importance to the Norderney&apos;s valuable cargoAugust, not reaching the enemy, that our naval dispositions had no doubt been influenced by the assurances he had given to me, and that withdrawal from these would createpainful impression. I added that with the increasing shortage of tonnage it wasin Brazil&apos;s best interests as well as our own to keep as many ships afloat and in use as possible.&quot; I told him also that once the Norderney was allowed to sail i could see no assurance that the Germans would not slip out of their bargain or simplysabotage the ships.&quot; He said that they would take measures to provide against these contin-gencies, and once the question .of German ships was out of the way they would immediately intern Italian ones. He had now dropped negotiations for thepurchase of these as Italians were trying to trick him at every turn.&apos;&apos; I said I would ascertain your views.&quot; Perhaps we might suggest to him in reply that the Norderney be allowedto sail only after the two German ships have.been delivered to the brazilian government, and that time limit be given to her within which to leave.&quot;1545A/11.&apos;: - &apos; (10)The Foreign Office to Sir Alexander Gadogan, further to telegram No. (8).[Sloane No. 20, despatched 3-53 p.m.*, llth August.)Following for Sir A. Cadogan from Foreign Office : Following is repeat of telegram No. 371 from Foreign Office to Rio de Janeiro,dated 9th August, repeated to Washington, No. 4470 : &apos;&quot; Your telegram No. 357 of 31st July (German ships in Brazilian ports).&apos;-&apos; You may tell Minister for Foreign Affairs that we are willing to facilitateagreement on the lines proposed, but we cannot agree actually to waive our&quot;belligerent rights until a definite settlement has been reached by WashingtonCommittee.&quot; 2. The above applies to Enemy Shipping Claims Committee&apos;s claims against Montevideo and Windhuk, but we are also instructing Boyle of enemy shipping Claims Committee that we should ourselves be willing to purchase lattervessel through the Brazilians if the latter can bring off the transaction with the requisite secrecy, i.e., the Germans are unlikely to sell if they know the ship is going to us.&apos;&apos; 3. As regards Norderney, we cannot agree to this vessel sailing. If,however, Minister for Foreign Affairs spontaneously offers to give us such timelyinformation as will involve her certain interception, you may say that you willrefer the matter to me.&quot;1553A/11.
11th should, of course, associate ourselves and presumably the Dutch Government willAugust.     do the same.  The notification to Japan would be secret. .Fourthly, the President wishes to issue at moment general release of meetingstory, probably 14th or 15th, a joint declaration signed by himself and me, onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, of broad principles which animate theU.S. and Great Britain at this fateful time. I send you herewith his draft ofstatementt (my immediately following telegram) which you will see is not free from difficulty attaching to all such declarations. The fourth condition wouldevidently have to be amended to safeguard our obligations contracted in Ottawaand not prejudice the future of imperial preference. This might fall into its place after war in a general economic settlement with decisive lowering of tariffs and trade barrier throughout the world. But we cannot settle it now. For sake of speedy agreement I have little doubt he will accept following amendments : After word &quot;endeavour&quot; insert &quot;With due respect to their existing obligations.&quot;And after word &quot; access &quot; omit words &quot; Without discrimination and.&quot;Also, leave out word &quot; markets &quot; and insert word &quot; trade.&quot;The seventh para, is most remarkable for its realism. The Presidentundoubtedly contemplates the disarmament of the guilty nations, coupled withmaintenance of strong united British and American armament, both by sea andair, for a long indefinite period.Having regard to our views about League of Nations or other internationalorganizations, I would suggest following amendment after word &quot;essential&quot;;&quot; Pending establishment of a wider and more permanent system of general security.&quot; He will not like this very much, but he attaches so much importanceto the joint declaration, which he believes will affect whole movement of U.S.opinion, that I think he will agree.It would be most imprudent on our part to raise unnecessary difficulties. Wemust regard this as an interim and partial statement of war aims designed to reassure all countries of our righteous purpose and not the complete structurewhich we should (group missing) after victory.You should summon the full War Cabinet, with any others you may think necessary, to meet to-night, and please let me have your views without the slightestdelay. Meanwhilst, immediately full accounts are being sent you on the other points, together with Cadogan&apos;s report of conversation. I fear President willbe very much upset if no joint statement can be issued, and grave and vital interests might be affected.I had purposed to leave afternoon 12th, but we have both now postponeddeparture 24 hours. Please let me have your views about the joint declaration in advance of those on other points which I have mentioned to you in thisskeleton form, and on which I am sending you separate telegram.1350Z/11.f Telegram No. (12).(12)The Prime Minister to the Lord Privy Seal, further to telegram No. (11).(Tudor  No.  16,  despatched  1-51  p.m.,  l\th  August, received  10-26  p.m.,llth August.)My Tudor No. 15. Following is draft of joint declaration as submitted tome by President: The President of U.S.A. and Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, representingHis Majesty&apos;s Government in United Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make known certain common principles in national policies of theirrespective countries on which they base their hopes for a better future for theworld.First, their countries seek no aggrandisement, territorial or other.Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with thefreely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned.Third, they respect the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see self-government restored to those from whom it has been forcibly removed.
(13)The Prime Minister to the Foreign Office.(Tudor No. 18, despatched 6-52 p.m., 11th August, received 12th August.)Following from Prime Minister, addressed Foreign Office :-r-1. The President has received a letter from Dr. Salazar, in which it is made clear that he is looking to Azores as a place of retreat for him and his Governmentin event of German aggression upon Portugal, and that his age-long alliance with england leads him to count on British protection during his enforced stay inthese islands. If, however, British were too much occupied elsewhere he wouldwillingly accept assistance of U.S. instead. The President would be well disposed to respond to such an appeal, and would like British, in circumstances foreseen,to propose Dr. Salazar the transference of responsibility. The above would also apply to Cape de Verdes.I told President that we contemplate operation known as Pilgrim; that we might be forced to act before a German violation of peninsula has occurred, andthat while this was going on we should be very busy. I pointed out that Pilgrimwould almost, though not absolutely certainly, provoke crisis in peninsula, and asked whether our having set events in train by Pilgrim would be any bar to his acceptance of responsibility indicated in paragraph 1. He replied as Pilgrimdid not affect Portugal it made no difference to his actions.He would feel justified in taking action if Portuguese Islands wereendangered, and we agree that they would certainly be endangered, if Pilgrimwere to take place, as Germans would have all the more need to forestall us there.In these circumstances he would none the less be ready to come to, the aid ofPortugal in the Atlantic Islands, and was holding destroyer forces available forthat purpose.I have shown foregoing to President, who agreed that it was a correctrepresentation of the facts.\ 1852Z/11.(14)The Prime Minister to the Foreign Office.(Tudor No.  19,  despatched  8-11  p.m.,   11 th  August,  received3-45  a.m.,12th August.)From Prime Minister for Foreign Office : The position about Japan is as follows .:-President proposed to Japan some time: ago neutralisation of Indo-Chinaand Siam under joint guarantee of U.S., Japan, Britain, China and others.Japanese reply, which will be cabled to you fully as soon as more urgent messages[22816] cFourth, they will endeavour to further enjoyment by all peoples of accesswithout discrimination and on equal terms to markets and to raw materials of world which are needed for their economic prosperity.Fifth, they hope to see established a peace, after final destruction of Nazityranny, which will afford all nations the means of dwelling in security within their own boundaries, and which will afford assurance to all peoples that theymay live out their lives in freedom from fear.Sixth, they desire such a peace to establish for all safety on the high seasand oceans.Seventh, they believe all of the nations of the world must be guided in spiritto the abandonment of the use of force. Because no further peace can bemaintained if land, sea or air armament continues to be employed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, at once to use force outside of their frontiers;they believe that the disarmament of such nations is essential. They will further the adoption of all other practicable means which will lighten for peace-lovingpeoples the crushing burden of armament.1351Z/11.(Note.-The Cabinet met at 1-45 a.m. on Tuesday, the 12th August, 1941, (W.M. (41)80th Conclusions), to consider telegrams Nos. (11) and (12). As a result of thisMeeting, telegram No. (15) below was despatched.)
llth have been dealt with, agrees to principles of no encroachment upon Siam and august.     military withdrawal from Indo-China, but add a number of conditions funda-mentally unacceptable.For instance, the withdrawal to take place after China incident is settled,meaning thereby after Chiang Kai-shek is strangled, and further requiringrecognition of Japan&apos;s preponderant position in these regions; also requiringUnited States to abstain from all further military preparations in these regions,and the reasonable lifting of the economic sanctions.2. Presidents idea is to negotiate about these unacceptable conditions andthus procure a moratorium of say thirty days in which we may improve ourposition in Singapore area, and the Japanese will have to stand still. But he will .tmake it a condition that the Japanese meanwhile encroach no further, and do $not use Indo-China as a base for an attack in China. He will also maintain infull force the economic measures directed against Japan. These negotiationsshow little chance of succeeding, but President considers that a month gainedwill be valuable. I pointed out, of course, that Japanese would double-cross him and would try to attack China or cut Burma communications. However, you may take it that they consider it right regardless to begin negotiations on these lines,and in view of what has passed between US. and Japan it will be necessary toaccept this fact.3. In the course of these negotiations, President would renew his proposalsfor neutralisation of Siam as well as Indo-China.4. At the end of the note which President will hand to japanese ambassador when he returns from his cruise in about a week&apos;s time, he will addthe following passage, which is taken from my draft : &quot; Any further encroachmentby Japan in S.W. Pacific would produce a situation in which the U.S. Govern-ment would be compelled to take counter-measures, even though these might leadto war between U.S. and Japan.&quot; He would also add something to the effect thatit was obvious, the Soviet being a friendly Power, U.S. Government would be similarly interested in any similar conflict in N.W. Pacific.5. I think this is entirely good and that we should associate ourselves there-with and endeavour to get the Dutch to come in in full agreement, because eitherJapanese will refuse the conditions the President prescribes namely, continuanceof the economic sanctions and no movements on Japanese part and no invasion of Siam or alternatively, they will go on with their military action while lyingabout it diplomatically.In this case the conditions indicated by final passage just quoted would comeinto play with great force, and the full effect of parallel declarations could berealised. Soviet Government should also be kept informed. It might be dangerous to tell the Chinese what we are doing for them, though they mightbe assured in general terms that we have had their security in mind in all thatwe have done.6. On all these grounds I consider we should endorse proposed course ofaction, and that the Dominions should be told about it and made to see that itis a very great advance towards gripping of Japanese aggression by united force.2011Z/11.(15)The Lord Privy Seal to the Prime Minister, in reply to telegrams Nos.

The Cabinet met at 10 a.m. on 12th August, 1941, to resume consideration of telegrams Nos. (11) and (12). By this time telegrams Nos. (13), (14) and (16) had arrived. As a result of this meeting telegram No. (18) was despatched (W.M. (41)81st Conclusions).)(17)The Prime Minister of Australia to the Prime Minister.(Abbey No. 34, despatched 10-34 a.m., 12^ August)Following has been received addressed to Prime Minister from Mr. Menziesand repeated to Prime Ministers, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand and to washington : &quot; My colleagues and I have given anxious consideration to the Far Eastposition. We have, as you know, always regarded Singapore and Malaya as ourvital outpost, and have at all times, as I indicated to the Foreign Office when inLondon, been prepared to join in a guarantee to the Netherlands East Indies.&apos;&apos; We have also assumed that, in the event of war with Japan, naval reinforce-ments as discussed in London with a nucleus of five capital ships would be sentto the Far East. We now say and emphasise that an early despatch of thecapital ships East of Suez would itself be the most powerful deterrent and thefirst step.&apos;&apos; We also once more urge that, having regard to the grave tension at presentexisting, air and military reinforcements to Malaya should be vigorouslyexpedited. The position of Thailand now comes up for early decision, for eventsappear to be moving rapidly.   Two urgent questions emerge: &quot;1. Should we, the British countries, be prepared to make it clear toThailand and to Japan that any attack upon Thailand by Japan willbe regarded by us as a casus belli.[22816] &apos; c 212th world which are needed for their economic prosperity, and to promoteAugust.        -   greatest possible expansion of markets for the interchange of goods and services throughout the world.&quot;This amendment has not yet been discussed with the Chancellor of theExchequer or President of the Board of Trade. .4. Between paragraphs 4 and 5 insert a new paragraph on the following&apos;lines : &quot; Fifth. They support the fullest collaboration between nations in theeconomic field with the object of securing for all peoples freedom from want,improved labour standards, economic advancement and social security.&quot;  5.   Cabinet concur in your amendment to paragraph 7.6. I will telegraph considered form of words for the two amendments proposed early to-morrow morning.0410A/12.
12th &quot; 2. Should we announce this to the countries concerned independently ofAugust. the United States action, or should we make it conditional uponAmerican concurrence and active participation.&apos;&apos; We are of opinion as the Government of one of the two British Dominionswhich are most directly affected, that the first question should be answered&quot;Yes,&quot; and that, while every pressure should be maintained upon the UnitedStates, it would be an error to condition our action upon American action, thoughactual objection by the United States of America would, of course, be fatal.&quot; Thailand&apos;s strategical position and resources are such that Japan&apos;soccupation of them would gravely imperil the safety of Singapore, effective controlof the waters around the Malay &quot;Peninsula, Philippines and the Netherlands East ))Indies, and the maintenance of the Chinese supplies along the Burma Road.&apos;&apos; Having regard to reality in the Far East, we do not believe Japan wantsThailand merely as an end in itself. Its capture or control would be plainly thefirst step that counts. In this connection, we have noted with regret thatMr. Sumner Welles&apos; warning to Japan seemed to indicate that the objectionablematter would not be occupation of Thailand, but only what might happensubsequently.&quot; Attitude of the United States, while constitutionally and politicallyunderstandable, is disappointing. We have throughout this period felt that clear and unequivocal (? warning omitted) to Japan by the United States would havestopped aggression. Up to the time of the coup in Indo-China it had not beenmade. Later on, Sumner Welles made much more vigorous statement to theJapanese representative, though it is subject to the criticism mentioned above.But the Japanese have still not been given firm warning. Indications of postponedresistance to aggression are merely encouragement.&quot; We feel that if we are prepared to fight, America will not, in fact, desertus.  Bold course might change the Whole outlook., &quot; Naturally, in all this we are assuming that whatever we do will be donein &quot;the closest consultation and agreement with the Netherlands East Indies.Subject to the above, our view can be summed up as being that, if Thailand isabandoned and we delay our action, we will be one country nearer to war andthat, in that war and in particular in the defence of Singapore, Japan will be relatively stronger and we relatively weaker than at present.&quot; We express these views frankly and with the realisation of their implications-tions, so that you may see the supreme importance which we attach to them.&quot;1034A/12(18)The Lord Privy Seal to the Prime Minister, in reply to telegram No. (16).(Abbey No. 35, despatched 1-41 p.m., llth August.)&quot;   . Following for Prime Minister from Lord Privy Seal: Your Tudor No. 20.1. The Cabinet held further meeting this morning. On paragraph 4 of thedraft declaration our considered view is that we should greatly prefer the revised draft in Abbey 31,* subject to the addition before &quot; promote &quot; of the words &quot; with due respect to their existing obligations.&quot; Our main reasons for preferring this form of words are as follows : 2. We desire to draw a distinction between raw materials and trade (ormarkets). We support giving access on equal terms to raw materials, and we see no reason for qualifying this by reserving our existing obligations.. We are,however, bound to make this reservation in dealing with trade in order to safe-guard Imperial preference, and, e.g., to prevent our markets from being undercut Jby countries with a low standard of life like Japan. &apos;3.   We also think that we should be pressed to interpret the phrase &quot; accesson equal terms to trade &quot; and. might find ourselves involved in difficulties.   It- might be interpreted in terms of extreme laissez faire.   For your information,we cannot accept any formula which might be held to prevent us continuing
(19)Sir Alexander Cadogan to the Foreign Office, in amplification of telegram No. (13).(Avenue!  No.  23,   despatched   11  p.m.,   12th  August,   received  6-39  p.m.,12th August.)From Sir Alexander Cadogan to Foreign Office: -Reference Tudor No. 18. Following is summary of Dr. Salazar&apos;s note to president: After gratefully acknowledging Presidents communication, it statesalthough Portugal did not share fear of an attack on Azores by Germany as longas latter did not control Atlantic, Portuguese Government have made every effort to keep Azores and Cape Verde Is. in a state of efficient complement.&apos;&apos; We believe that Military Forces and material accumulated in islands and also other aeronautical and A.A. material which British Governmenthave pledged themselves to furnish immediately, will put islands in a state which would render successful attack impossible.&quot; England has received this assurance, and we gave it to Brazil as wellin so far our effective dominion over of Atlantic islands may concern their defence. Yet if England were to meet with difficulties in regard to delivery of above-mentioned supplies, or others considered necessary, I would bethankful to find on part of U.S. Government facilities for realization of anend in which they are also particularly interested thus.&quot;Note proceeds to say this is written on assumption of continuance of neutralpolicy adopted by Portugal since beginning of war. &apos;&apos; Should this policy be changed by a violation of our neutrality, the situation which would arise shouldbe examined and our policy reshaped accordingly. I do not wish to contemplatesuch an event, but I fully appraise the whole meaning and value of Your12th exchange control after the war.   We fear that the Presidents formula, even asAugust.     amended by you, might be interpreted as limiting our essential freedom of actionin this respect.4. More generally our view is that our formula is more in harmony with present-day economic conceptions and tendencies and is more likely to be accep-table to public opinion in the Dominions. If, however, you would find greatdifficulty in getting it accepted, the Cabinet are prepared to accept the Presidentsdraft, subject to your amendments.5. The Cabinet attach great importance to the new paragraph proposed inAbbey 31* for insertion between paragraphs 4 and 5. The substance of thisparagraph has figured in a number of previous declarations, notably president roosevelt s speech and the Resolutions of the Inter-Allied Meeting at St. James&apos;son 12th June. The omission of a paragraph on these lines would be most markedand would have an unfortunate effect on public opinion in this country and theDominions and on the Allied Governments. The Cabinet think that the newparagraph suggested in Abbey No. 31 will do as drafted.6. As regards the Dominions, we think that the Declaration must be signed by yourself, as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. It will, however, clearly be necessary to let the Dominion Prime Ministers see the text as quickly aspossible and to give them an opportunity of expressing their concurrence and of publishing it simultaneously.7. We are, accordingly, telegraphing to the Dominion Prime Ministersinforming them that a short statement, declaratory of the attitude of the twoGovernments, is being prepared and will probably be signed and released shortly.We are telling them that we shall forward a copy of the&apos; text as soon as available.Please, therefore, send us a copy of the text as finally agreed as quickly as possible.1341 A/12.* Telegram No. (15).

Reference Tudortelegram No. 19 : -Japanese proposals to U.S. Government are accompanied by covering note which protests that measures taken by naval authorities are entirely peaceful in character and for self-defence only.Present proposals are intended as reply to the suggestion made by thePresident on the 24th July in conversations with Japanese Ambassador and &quot; toprovide fresh basis for Japanese-American understanding on which informal conversations have been carried on during past month.&quot;Japanese Government are convinced of necessity of examining all causes ofstrained relations between Japan and U.S. and of endeavouring to remove suchcauses as will affect Military, Political and Economic equilibrium that should normally exist between the two countries.Following is summary of proposals that (? would probably be) arranged : 1. (a) To remove menace of military character to U.S., Japan will not further station troops in South-Western Pacific except Indo-China,and Japanese troops now in Indo-China &quot; will be withdrawn also onsettlement of the China incident.&quot;(6) To remove menace of political and military character to PhilippineIslands, Japan will guarantee neutrality of islands &apos;&apos; at an opportunetime &quot; on conditions of no discrimination against Japan and Japanesesubjects.(c) To remove causes of instability of economic relations between japan and U.S., Japan will co-operate with U.S. in production andprocurement of such natural resources as are required by U.S.2. &apos;(a) To remove menace of military character to Japan, U.S. will suspendtheir military measures in South-Western Pacific and, upon successful conclusion of present conversations, will advise Governments of GreatBritain and Netherlands to take similar steps.(b) To remove causes of military, political and economic friction, U.S. will-operate with Japan in production and procurement of natural resources required by Japan in South-Western Pacific, especially inNetherlands East Indies.(c) In conjunction with building under (b) above, U.S. will restore normalrelations of trade and commerce which have hitherto existed between japan and U.S.(d) In view of undertaking by Japanese Government in 1 (a) above, U.S. will use its good offices for initiation of direct negotiations betweenJapanese Government and Chiang Kai-shek regime for speedy settle-ment of China incidents, and U.S. &quot; will recognise a special status of Japan in French Indo-China even after withdrawal of japanese troops from that area.&quot;1312Z/12.
(22)The Prime Minister to the Lord Privy Seal.(Tudor No.  21,  despatched 2-57  p.m.,  12th August,  received  12-55  a.m.,13th August.)President and I have agreed on following joint (1 message) to M. Stalin.Please instruct H.M. Ambassador in Moscow to arrange with his U.S. colleagueto communicate it to M. Stalin as soon as convenient. We propose to publish itin American and British morning papers Saturday, the 16th August : &apos;&apos; We have taken opportunity afforded by consideration of report ofMr. Harry Hopkins on his return from Moscow to consult together as to how best our two countries can help your country in the splendid defence that youare making against Nazi attack. We are at the moment co-operating to provideyou with very maximum supplies that you most urgently need. Already manyshiploads have left our shores and more will leave in immediate future.&quot; The needs and demands of your and our armed services can only bedetermined in the light of the full knowledge of the many factors which mustbe taken into consideration in conjectures that we make. In order that all of usmay be in a position to arrive at speedy decisions as to apportionment of our jointresources, we suggest that we prepare a meeting to be held at Moscow to whichwe would send high representatives who could discuss these matters directly with you. If this conference appeals to you, we want you to know that pendingdecisions of that conference we shall continue to send supplies and material as rapidly as possible.&quot; We must now turn our minds to the consideration of a more long-term policy, since there is still a long and hard path to be traversed before there canbe won that complete victory without which our efforts and sacrifices would be wasted.&quot; The war goes on upon many fronts and before it is over there may be yetfurther fighting on fronts that will be developed. Our resources though immenseare limited, and it must become a question as to where and when those resourcescan best be used to further to principal extent our common effort. This appliesequally to manufactured war supplies and to raw materials.&quot; We realise fully how vitally important to the defeat of Hitlerism is thebrave and steadfast resistance of Soviet Union, and we feel therefore that wemust not in any circumstances fail to act quickly and immediately in this matterof planning the programme for the future allocation of our joint resources.&quot;12thAugust.c1457Z/12.15(21)The Lord Privy Seal to the Prime Minister, in reply to telegram No. (14).(Abbey No. 36, despatched 6-36 p.m., 12th August.)Following from Lord Privy Seal: 1. Your Tudor 19 was considered this morning by Cabinet, who warmlyapplaud the course of action outlined, and congratulate you on what you have achieved.2. We are sending to the Dominion Prime Ministers the first four para-graphs of Tudor 19. This will in effect answer the main point in Menzies&apos;telegram of 11th August, repeated to you in Abbey No. 34.*3.

He is going to proceed to Washington to discuss further details with appropriate officials of United States Government. These con-ferences will also cover supply problem of Soviet Union.The President and Prime Minister have had several conferences. They have considered the dangers to world civilization arising from policy of militarydomination by conquest upon which Hitlerite Government of Germany and otherGovernments associated therewith have embarked, and have made clear the steps which their countries are respectively taking for their safety in facing thesedangers.-  . They have agreed upon following joint declaration : &quot;The President of the United States and Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill,representing His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, being mettogether, deem it right to make known certain common principles in national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopes for a betterfuture for the world.First, their countries seek no aggrandisement, territorial or other.Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with thefreely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned.Third, they respect right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them.Fourth, they will endeavour, with due respect for their existing obligations,to further enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access,on equal terms, to trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity.Fifth, they desire to bring about fullest collaboration between all nations in economic field, with object of securing for all improved labour standards,economic advancement and social security.Sixth, after final destruction of Nazi tyranny, they hope to see established a peace which will afford all nations the means of dwelling in safety within theirown boundaries, and which will afford assurance that all the men in all the landsmay live out their lives in freedom from fear and want.Seventh, such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas andoceans without hindrance.Eighth, they believe all of the nations of the world, for realistic as well asspiritual reasons, must come to abandonment of use of force. Since no futurepeace can be maintained if land, sea or air armament continues to be employedby nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of their frontiers. Hthey believe, pending establishment of a wider and more permanent system ofgeneral security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential. They willlikewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armament.1529Z/12.
The Prime Minister to the Lord Privy Seal.(Tudor  No.  23,  despatched 4-39  p.m.,  12th  August,  received  4-29   a.m.,13th August.)Following for Lord Privy Seal :-Please thank Cabinet for amazingly swift reply.* I put your alternativeclause 4 to President, but he preferred to stick to phrasing already agreed. Ido not myself see any real difference. Phrase about &quot; respect for existing obligations &apos;&apos; safeguards our relations with Dominions. We could not see howcompetition of cheap labour would come in, as all countries preserve right of retaining or imposing national tariffs as they think fit pending better solutions.2. The President cordially accepted your new paragraph 5, but you will see that reference &apos;&apos; want(ed) &apos;&apos; comes in where President originally wished it at end of paragraph 6. A few verbal flourishes not affecting substance havebeen added.3. We have laid special stress on warning to (1 Japan), which constitutesteeth of Presidents communication. One would always fear State Departmenttrying to tone it down; but President has promised definitely to use hardlanguage.4. Arrival of Russia as a welcome guest at hungry table and need of largesupplementary programme both for ourselves and U.S. forces makes review and expansion of U.S. production imperative. President proposes shortly to askCongress for another 5 billion dollar loan-lease Bill.President welcomes Beaverbrook&apos;s arrival at Washington, and I am convinced this is needful practical step. See also the Roosevelt-Churchill message to dear old Joe. I think they will send Harriman to represent them, and i should propose Beaverbrook should go for us to Moscow or wherever Russian Governmentis. We do not wish conference in Russia to start before latter part of September,by when it is hoped we shall know where Russian Front will lie for winter.5.   They are sending us immediately 150,000 more rifles, and I look for -improved allocations of merchant shipping, bombers and tanks.   I hope they willtake over whole ferry service and delivering both in England and in West Africaby American pilots, many of whom may stay for war training purposes with us.6. Your promptness has enabled me to start home to-day, 12th. Presidentis sending two American destroyers with us, who are not considered escort but will chip in if any trouble occurs. Franklin Junior is serving on one of themand has been appointed liaison officer to me during my days in Iceland (C), wherethere will be a joint review of British and American forces.7. Lord Beaverbrook is now proceeding with Harriman by air to UnitedStates.  The joint telegram to Stalin comes out 48 hours after main story.8.

(26)The Chiefs of Staff Committee to the First Sea Lord.(Sloane No. 26, despatched 1-55 p.m., 13th August.)Following for First Sea Lord from Chiefs of Staff: We have considered the pros and cons of replacing six of the ships held forPilgrim by others equally suitable for the Operation. The advantages which weshould derive are considerable, namely : (a) The addition of 10,000 troops to Convoy W.S. 11 for Middle East.(b) The release of 1-g million cubic feet of refrigerated space to trade.2.   The disadvantages are  (a) We should be unable to launch Pilgrim before 8th September.(b) We should lose the experience gained in recent exercises by the crews of three ships.3. We consider that, in view of our present information about affairs in spain, including talks with M. A., Madrid, now home, the pros outweigh the cons,and we therefore propose to change the ships. But before doing so we wishto know whether any developments arising out of Riviera make this courseinadvisable.1355A/13.(27)First Sea Lord to Chiefs of Staff Committee, in reply to telegram No. (26).(Avenue  No.  32,  despatched 9-19  p.m.,  ISth August,  received  1-54 a.m.,14cth August.)Following for Chiefs of Staff from First Sea Lord.

Cabinet this morning considered question of an early meeting of fourDominion Prime Ministers in London in the following circumstances : 2. Mr. MacDonald telegraphed yesterday that Mr. Mackenzie King, whohas now postponed his arrival in England until 21st August, had suggested thatit might be possible to hold such a meeting at the end of August.3. Mr. Menzies has announced publicly that provided he can secure con-ciirrence of Labour party in Australia he proposes, at the request of his cabinet colleagues, to proceed to London at a very early date to deal with the major questions of Empire policy and strategy, with particular reference apparentlyto the Far East.4. Mr. Fraser had intended to return very shortly to New Zealand havingregard to Far Eastern situation and to impending General Election there, but has stated that if there is good prospect of arranging meeting with all four PrimeMinisters he would be prepared to stay here a little longer notwithstanding thegreat inconvenience which this would cause him; He was emphatic that meeting should not exceed two or three days.5. General Smuts arrived Cairo 12th August, and is due to return to SouthAfrica in a few days&apos; time.6. As two Dominion Prime Ministers have suggested Conference, Cabinetfeit that possibility must again be considered notwithstanding the practicaldifficulties.7. View of Cabinet was that while time has not come for a full conference to discuss especially post-war problems, there is something to be said for a brief13thAugust.

Reference Abbey 46.1. Menzies has only recently returned Australia, and I cannot think weshould be justified in summoning him half round the world by air for only or 4 days&apos; conference in a fortnight&apos;s time. He would no doubt like invitation to join War Cabinet, but this raises many complications about other Dominionsand size of the War Cabinet.Although he is unhappy in Australia, there is no other man of comparableeminence and knowledge there.2. I doubt whether Smuts can be away from South Africa for so long, andalso whether we should press him to dangers of flight through Mediterranean.3. I hope to see Fraser before he leaves, but I do not think he should be pressed to stay till end of month.4. Is it not much better to let Mackenzie King come alone, treating him with all the ceremony extended to Menzies and Fraser ?5. Delay in answer due to difficulty of breaking W/T silence with manyU-Boats about.1357/15.(30)The Prime Minister to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.(Tudor No.  32,  despatched 1-47 p.m.,  15th August,  received  12-29 p.m.,16th August.)From Prime Minister for Foreign Secretary: If you think well, please send message in my immediately following telegram to Menzies through Dominions Office and take any preliminary action you may think necessary. When time comes I should propose myself to tell JapaneseCharge d&apos;Affaires that, if Japan disregards American warning and becomesinvolved in war with U.S., we shall range ourselves instantly by the side ofAmericans.   This might be Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.2. I told President about our plans in Persia and he seemed to be quitecontent with them.   I presume you are going- ahead as arranged.3.   I read your wind-up of session with much pleasure.1347Z/15.c[22816]E14th meeting for purposes of general consultation as to the war position with august. particular reference to Far East. Important effect on public opinion here and inDominions of such a meeting following on your return from meeting with president Roosevelt needs no emphasis.8. Practical difficulty exists in the time factor. You are acquainted with local difficulties in South Africa which prevent General Smuts from being away from there for long. Mr. Menzies could not hope to arrive in England beforeend of August, so that General Smuts&apos;s return to South Africa would in effect be delayed for at least three weeks.9. Notwithstanding these difficulties the Cabinet thought that it would be right to put the.matter before you and to obtain your views as to whether an approach should at once be made to General Smuts in Cairo, whose position isclearly the determining factor. Cabinet favour an immediate telegram being-despatched to him explaining the situation and asking whether he could see his way to attend such a meeting towards the end of the month without, however,putting undue pressure on him to attend against his better judgment.1656A/14.
(31)The Prime Minister to the Seoretary of State for Foreign Affairs.(Tudor No. 33 despatched 1-49 p.m., 15th August, received p,m., 16th August.)Following is message for Menzies referred to in my immediately preceding telegram* to Foreign Secretary :-Many thanks for your telegram (Abbey 20). t You have no doubt seen relevantcables about meeting. I trust you approve what was accomplished. Presidentpromised me to give the warning to Japan in terms agreed.Once we know this has been done, we should range ourselves beside him and make it clear that, if Japan becomes involved in war with U.S., she will alsobe at war with Britain and British Commonwealth. I am arranging this withEden and you will be advised through regular channels.You should note that the Presidents warning covers an attack upon Russiaso that perhaps Stalin will line up, too, and, of course, the Dutch. If thiscombined front can be established, including China, I feel confident that Japan will lie quiet for a while. It is, however, essential to use firmest language andstrongest combination.U.S. Navy is effectively taking over U.S.A.-Iceland stretch of Atlantic, thusgiving us relief equal to over fifty destroyers and corvettes soon to be availablein home waters and South Atlantic.1349A/15.* Telegram No. (30). f Telegram No. (2).i (32)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Prime Minister, in reply to telegrams nos.

The first sentence of that paragraph will now read : &quot; Once we knowthis has been done, we should range ourselves beside him.&quot;3. Reason for omission is that we had contemplated that we should giveJapan a parallel warning to that which U.S. Government propose to give, i.e.,that any further encroachment on her part will compel us to take countermeasures even if these may lead to war.4. Intention was that Dutch should say the same, and from Menzies&apos;earlier telegrams I have no doubt that he will expect such action. There is muchto be said for adding to this warning action you now propose, but effect on Japan will clearly be less than parallel warning on same lines as U.S. Government. Ihave no doubt that Japan already regards it as axiomatic that if she becomesinvolved in war with the United States, the British Empire and the Dutch willjoin in.5, This and Other aspects of A Eastern situation I Would like to discussearly on your return.

ANNEX.(33)Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the United Kingdom High Commissioners in Canada,the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa.(Z No. 256, despatched 8-15 p.m., 6th August.)Please give following message from Mr. Churchill to Prime Ministerimmediately for his most secret and personal information : (Strictly Personal and Secret.)A little while ago I received an invitation, through Mr. Hopkins, from president Roosevelt to meet him somewhere in Newfoundland. With theapproval of The King and the War Cabinet, I thought it my duty to accept, andhave accordingly started. The President has expressed lively pleasure, and afterthe meeting has taken place full publicity will be given at a moment to be fixed by mutual agreement. Till then all is evidently most secret. Although we have long been in intimate correspondence and have spoken over the telephone, I havenever had the pleasure of meeting President Roosevelt. I am taking theFirst Sea Lord, the C.I.G.S. and the V.C.A.S., Sir Alexander Cadogan of theForeign Office, together with various technical officers; and Mr. Hopkins, onhis way back from Russia, is also coming with me. The President is bringngMr. Sumner Welles, Admiral Stark, and the opposite numbers of the Army andAir Chiefs. We expect the meeting will last about three days, during which time the whole field of future action can be explored. I can return at short noticeby Air if necessary. I hope you will approve of this action, which may beproductive of important benefits and can hardly be harmful. Naturally, I hopethat the President would not have wished for this meeting unless he contemplatedsome further forward step. I shall keep you informed of what happens. Kindestregards.
