THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &quot;S GOVERNMENT^SECRET. WAR CABINET,,    \ jf Copy no      2 9wTpTT41)178o /July - 25a 1941.       mgMgfng ENEMY CREWS WHO SCUTTLE THEIR SHIPS.MEMORANDUM BY THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY.The proposal to anaomce that we shall leave to their fate the crews of enemy vessels which scuttle has previously been rejected on theground that the inhumanity of such an act would be at variance with the traditions of the Royal Navy0   We fully recognise the importance of preventingscuttling and that , &quot;by the issue of such an announcement we should probablyprevent some ships from scuttling,,   The Admiralty ares however, of theopinion that in doing so we should have more to lose than to gain from thereprisals which the Germans would almost inevitably adopt 020 German raiders invariably open fire without warning against Britishand Allied shipping, but they have, as a rule, and often at considerableinconvenience to themselves, rescued creve and passengers from the ships which they sink.   If we leave crews of scuttled enemy ships to their fateit seems most probable that the German Government would order their raiderssimilarly to abandon the crews of British and Allied ships which they sinks,This might well have a serious effect upon the morale of the Merchant Navy,particularly since raiders operate, as a rule, in open waters far removed from populous trade routes where the opportunities of rescuing those left in open boats are remote0   Indeed the following extract from a capturedGerman document suggests that the Germans have the possibility of suchreprisals in mindswIt is therefore safe to reason that England will not treat aspirates the crews of German merchant ships or transports whichuse armed force in self-defence 0   Should the enemy attemptanything of this kind this is&quot; to be answered with the warning that all the crews of English merchant vessels, who have usedtheir weapons and are already in German hands, or will becaptured in future, will be treated as piratess   Knowing thata large number of such crews is already in German hands, theEnglish will be afraid of taking such steps&quot;03e The number of merchant ships, which have been sunk by raidersin the past, is large and there is no reason yet to suppose that thismenace has been overcome0   On the other hand, the number of enemy merchant ships which could be intercepted is likely to be comparatively smalleIt therefore seems abundantly clear that by adopting the policy under reviewwe should stand to lose a large number of valuable Merchant Navy officersand seamen and at best save only a few enemy ships,4c Moreover, we ourselves adopted certain scuttling measures&amp;Our oilers have instructions to scuttle rather than be captured by enemyraiders and we have also issued instructions to the effect that armedguards in charge of French ships seized on the high seas are to scuttlerather than to allow their prize to be recaptured by French warships 050 For the above reasons I do not recommend that an announcement on thelines suggested by the Cabinet should be made0   We have recently issued to theFleet fresh instructions which are designed to prevent enemy ships fromscuttling,,   A copy of these is attached,,   It is not clear how far they have been successful, but reports are being called for from those Coaauands whose ships havintercepted enemy vessels within the last two months to obtain detailsconcerning efficacy of these instructions0   It has always been accepted thata Master who was determined to scuttle and had a determined crew would succeedsThis determination must, however, vary from ship to ship, but I am hopeful thatour new instructions authorising vigorous intimidatory action will offer a good chance of increasing our successes against the less determined scuttier,without incurring injurious reprisals.,previous reference ^encesW.k .41)62nd Cons,Minc 5-oAdmiralty, S,W010July 25, 1941.Ao Vs ko

SECREToMESSAGE.To    &quot;A&quot; Message Home and Abroad 36A Date    l05p410Naval Code (j) PERMANENT.Prom Admiralty,NITEo NOTWT Home.Admiralty message 834A dated November 23rd 1939 is cancelledclo Attention is again drawn to the great importance in the presentshipping situation of preventing the scuttling of enemy merchant ships.The difficulty of frustrating a determined and well prepared attempt toscuttle is recognised, but not all attempts are determined or well prepared,and to prevent scuttling every effort must be made in accordance with thefollowing revised instructions.2e Commanding Officers are given full discretion to take such steps as the circumstances require.3. Normally: -(a)   the main &quot;object should be to get xne boarding party on board the, x     enemy ships as quickly as possible:(b;   to this end, untxl the boarding party can be sent, attention should be concentrated on hindering scuttling measures.   In most cases this wouldbe best achieved by rapid action to intimidate crew and to prevent themtaking taking to boats.   The following significance is therefore beingby broadcast given to group WBA in the International Code: -&quot;Stop - do not lower boats - do not use radio - do not scuttle -if you disobey I open fire&quot;.4. The first consideration of Commanding Officers should be to save the ship and they have authority to use force to get this order obeyed.5. Crews should not be left in open boats on high seas or to drownin ship as this would be contrary to dictates of humanity observed by royal navy.6. Aircraft sighting a suspect ship should report and shadowendeavouring to remain unobserved.   No repeat no attempt should be made to divert a ship unless surface vessels are unable to make contact in which caseobjects of aircraft should be;-( i)   to prevent crew scuttling and taking to boatse( ii)&apos; to divert ship to most suitable British or Allied Warshipor most suitable British or Allied port.7. In this case aircraft should be guided by 3 (b) and 4 above.1943/1.for Head of M. (Ex.808).Approved by the Prime Minister.
