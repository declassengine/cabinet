THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet,   June 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 15.5th June, 1945.CABINET.REPATRIATION OF CIVILIANS EVACUATED FROM THECHANNEL   ISLANDS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. When the Channel Islands were evacuated in 1940 some 14,000 civiliansleft from Jersey and 22,000 from Guernsey. The majority of those persons arenow in the United Kingdom.2. After the Islands were liberated the following statement was made inthe House by my predecessor : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that people who have homes in the Channel Islands as well as those who have friends andrelatives will be anxious to go to the Islands as soon as possible. For the timebeing, however, all available transport is required for sending essential supplies to the civilian population and for meeting the needs of the military situation.Passenger traffic will be restored as soon as possible, and a public announcementwill be made as soon as it can be resumed.&quot;3. It is now three weeks since the Islands were liberated and it is time that some indication is given to the public about the plans for the return ofthe Islanders. The Commander of the military forces in the Islands has been consulted and considers that it is important that an announcement should bemade in the near future in order to allay the anxiety in the Islands.4. The Islands&apos; authorities have also been consulted and agree that anuncontrolled return of residents would create very serious problems, particularly of accommodation and unemployment. They consider that the Islands couldabsorb in the near future about 600 additional persons per week, and they areprepared to undertake the -responsibility of allotting priorities. The sort of people whom they would select for early return would be first those for whom there is immediate employment in the Islands and, secondly, those who havehomes to go to and whose reabsorption would create no problems in the Islands.There is no question of allowing anyone to go to the Islands this year for holidaypurposes. The Islands&apos; authorities agree that Members of Parliament, leadersof religious denominations, trade unionists and other representatives of semi-official bodies should be allowed to go. It is proposed that an announcement should be made in the press in this country instructing those persons who wishto return to the Channel Islands to make application to the authorities in the islands on a form which will be obtainable from the Passport and Permit Office.The Islands&apos; authorities will send lists of selected persons to the Passport Officewho will then be responsible for issuing Exit Permits and travel warrants.5. The Ministry of War Transport have already earmarked one passengerboat for the Channel Islands service. It requires considerable refitting before it is suitable for passenger traffic and it is not likely to be ready for service for five to eight weeks. Its capacity will be about 200 passengers and it willbe able to make three return trips each week, i.e., 600 passengers a week.Negotiations are in progress for the release of another ship, but this will notbe ready for service for some considerable time.6. The Department of Civil Aviation have considered the possibility of starting a civil air service to the Channel Islands, but owing to technical difficulties[30007]Copy No.
2it is most unlikely that any air service will be available for at least a month and I understand&apos;that the capacity of the service when it is started would notbe more than about 100 passengers per week.7. I think it is essential that some arrangements should be made immediately to start the flow of returning residents to the Islands, and theGovernment would be subjected to strong criticism if no facilities can be avail-able for so long as six weeks or two- months. At present Transport command of the E.A.F. are responsible for the air service to the Islands and they should,in my view, be asked to arrange as a matter of great urgency to provide sufficientaircraft to transport of the order of 600 persons per week to the Islands. Thepeople transported would be expected to pay their own fares, and the States areprepared to pay for those who could not afford to do so.8. In addition to the persons mentioned above there will be a number of people who wish to visit the Islands on compassionate grounds. It is proposedthat such visits should be restricted to really urgent cases and that all applioa-tions for permission to visit the Islands on these grounds should be referred to themilitary authorities in the Islands who will satisfy themselves that there is a realneed and will authorise the visit in each case. Special arrangements are beingmade by the Air Ministry to provide transport for Service personnel going to the islands on compassionate grounds and accommodation will be available for acertain number of civilians on this service. The total numbers of both Serviceand civilian compassionate cases are not likely to be more than about 100 weeklyand their stay in the Islands will in nearly all cases be short.The return of the population of Alderney, from which the whole Britishpopulation of about 1.500 was evacuated in 1940, presents special problems whichhave to be considered separately and arrangements for their return cannot bemade as vet.D.
