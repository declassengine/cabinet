THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1945.Copy No.CABINET.POSTPONEMENT OF POLLING DAY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.1. From such information as has reached the Home Office and the scottish office it appears that in addition to the constituencies mentioned in the list whichhas already been published there are certain other constituencies where a substan-tial number of the voters will be on holiday on the 5th July and postponementto the 12th July would be advantageous. The original list of constituencies plusthese additional constituencies is shown in the Appendix. It is possible that further information may be received resulting in some further additions to this list.2. It has been ascertained that in the Nelson and Colne constituency therewill be substantial numbers of voters absent on holiday on both the 5th July andthe 12th July, and the same is true to a less extent of Berwick and Haddington.In these constituencies it would be advantageous to postpone polling day till the19th July, by which time the holidays will have ended, and there would be nodifficulty in providing in the proposed Bill that in these two constituencies pollingday shall be postponed until the 19th July. So far as is known at present, thereare no other constituencies in the same position, but it is possible that later information may indicate that one or two more places should be added to thosescheduled for polling day on the 19th July.3. Information has been received that at West Houghton, which has been included in the list of places where polling day shall be postponed until the12th July, and at Coventry, which has hitherto not been included in the list,very substantial numbers of voters will be away on holiday on the 5th, 12th and19th July, and that the numbers absent on each of these dates will be about thesame. Captain Strickland, M.P. for Coventry, has made strong representations to the effect that the mere postponement of polling day will be of no advantage in his constituency, and that to meet the situation which arises in Coventry andin other places the proper plan is to arrange that either the poll shall be openon two polling days in separate weeks or that voters who expect to go away on holiday should be allowed to apply to vote by post. In our opinion neither ofthese proposals is practicable. Any extension of the facilities for postal votingto persons who expect to go away on holidays would have to cover very largenumbers of people throughout the country, and any such extension would break the electoral machine. The objections to keeping the poll open and to havingtwo polling days in separate weeks are obvious, and even if such a scheme couldbe contemplated its limitation to a certain number of specified constituenciescould not be justified. For instance, it is known that substantial numbers ofworkers in factories and shipyards in the Glasgow area will be on staggeredholidays during July, and in almost all constituencies throughout the country it could be urged that a substantially larger number of people would be able tocast their votes if they had a choice of days in different weeks.Our conclusion, therefore, is that no amendment of the law is practicable to meet the situation in Coventry or in other places where large and approxi-mately equal sections of the voters will be absent on the 5th, 12th and 19th July,and that West Houghton should accordingly be withdrawn from the list alreadypublished. The withdrawal of West Plough ton after the publication of theprovisional list may cause trouble and if the M.P. for this constituency prefersthat the polling date should be the 12th July, West Houghton might be left inthe schedule.SECRET.CP. (45) 10.2nd June, 1945.[30001]
24. It is understood that in certain places where holidays have been arranged for particular works or particular pits during the week which includes the5th July, steps are being contemplated for an alteration of the dates of the holidays, and the question has been raised whether Government departmentswho have advised the staggering of holidays should take the initiative in advisingthat holiday arrangements which clash with polling day should be altered. Itseems to us, however, that any initiative in this matter by Government depart-ments would be undesirable. Great difficulties must obviously arise in altering the dates of holidays, having regard especially to the difficulty which holiday-makers have at the present time in securing accommodation, and any attempt torearrange the complex and interlocking schemes of various works in variouslocalities would be likely to cause dislocation of domestic and personal arrange-ments and create widespread dissatisfaction.D.
