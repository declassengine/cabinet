Draft King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :1. The present Parliamentary session, which I am now bringing to a close,has seen the final overthrow and unconditional surrender of our enemies inEurope. Their leaders, almost without exception, are either dead by their ownhand or held in Allied custody. At last, after more than five years of mortalstrife, Europe is liberated from the foul tyranny that threatened to enslave it.This deliverance is due not only to the resolution with which My people in these islands have carried on the struggle, but also to the stalwart aid so freely givenby the peoples and governments of My Commonwealth and Empire, to the mightycontributions in men and materials made by the United States, and to theindomitable armies of much-suffering and heroic Russia. So persistent, sowidespread and so united a co-operation of great States to rescue Europeanfreedom from a hideous menace has never before been seen in the history of theworld. Nor must we fail to express our deep admiration of the endurance withwhich so many of the inhabitants of the other nations of Europe, now happilyrestored to their former independence, have joined in resisting Nazi aggression.I, with all My peoples, take pride in the thought that it was we who stood aloneto face the foe in the darkest days, and who now share in the common triumph.2. It has given The Queen and Myself particular pleasure to have been ableto visit My loyal subjects in the Channel Islands; and I rejoice that they, whosuffered so long under the German invader, are once more free.3. I have already had an opportunity, in replying to your loyal Addressesof Congratulation, to pay tribute to all that has been done by My peoples, whether in the Armed Forces or in other forms of national endeavour. It is a wonderfulrecord of constancy, faith and courage in every part of our national life and a striking manifestation of the historic character and quality of the British people.4. My thoughts have been constantly with the peoples of the commonwealth and Empire whose lands still suffer from the tyrannous Japanese occupation.The swift advance of the Allied Forces closing in on Japan, and especially theresounding victory in Burma, has brought nearer their liberation. Though heavylabours and tribulations may stilt lie ahead, the downfall of our enemy in Europeenables us to bend all our energies to the task, which we shall share with our allies, of crushing the aggressor in the Far East.5. The grievous sacrifices which My peoples and My gallant Allies havehad to bear in these long years of war will not have been in vain if they lead tothe establishment of a new world order based upon justice and respect for human rights, and equipped to crush any future attempt to disturb the peace of theworld. At San Francisco My Ministers have striven to further the framing of aninternational organisation by which future generations may be spared from thehorrors of war.6.* My Government have authorised the Governor-General of India to invitethe participation of Indian political leaders in the Government of British India.I earnestly hope that this invitation will be accepted, so that the immediate tasks of the waging of the war against Japan and the post-war development of Indiamay be undertaken with the full co-operation of all sections of Indian publicopinion.7. I have assented with great satisfaction to the Colonial Development and welfare (Amendment) Act, which both substantially increases the amount ofmoney to be made available to assist colonial development and prolongs the periodof assistance. The resources so provided will be of the greatest help to colonial governments in those plans which they are now preparing to improve theconditions and standards of living of the peoples in their territories.Members of the House of Commons :8. I thank you for the provision which you have made towards the heavycost of conducting the war and of every branch of the public service.* This paragraph is contingent on the announcement which it is proposed that theSecretary of State for India should make next week.
My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :9. Plans have been completed for the orderly release of men and women from the Armed Forces under a scheme which ensures fair treatment to serving-men and women, and there has been a recent relaxation of the control over theemployment of labour. Much progress has also been made with the arrange-ments for training men and women released from the Forces or from industrialwar work and for compensating and resettling those who are disabled as a resultof their service.10. Steps have been taken, in close co-operation with the Governments ofthe United States and Canada, to overcome the grave shortages in world suppliesof many essential foods. These shortages make yet more necessary the vigorousand sustained efforts of the agricultural community and the men of the fishingfleets in providing food for My peoples.11. The destruction of our homes by the enemy and the urgent need to con-concentrate our manpower for nearly six years on tasks directly connected withthe prosecution of the war have led to a widespread shortage of houses. general   -getic measures have already been taken to restore houses damaged by enemy attack and to prepare housing sites, and the maximum effort is being devoted to thenroduction and erection of new houses. To this end arrangements have beenmade to augment the number of those available for house building both by special releases of building workers from other industries and from the armed forces and by the training of new recruits for the building industry.12. I have given Mv assent to a number of measures which have beenbrought before you during the course of the year.13. Legislation has been passed to provide for a scheme of family allowances.This measure is a forerunner of the further proposals for a comprehensive system of national insurance.* A further stage in the development of industriallegislation has been marked by the passing of a measure for the improvementof machinery for the regulation of remuneration and conditions of employment and to assist organisations of employers and workpeople to maintain the standards of wages and working conditions established by their voluntaryagreements. A much needed reform has been effected in the law concerningcontributory negligence. Henceforward a claimant who proves that his injuryis due to another&apos;s fault will not fail to secure some compensation merely because a certain degree of fault is attributable to him. Among the Bills relating to scotland which have received My assent is a measure to amend the law relatingto education and to introduce reforms which will promote the progressive development of the educational system.14. Provision has been made for the resumption of local elections, andreforms have been made in the law relating to the representation of the people.Effect has been given to the Report of the Boundary Commission for Englandregarding the division of abnormallv large constituencies.15. Measures have been passed to finance capital expenditure incurred bylocal authorities; to assist the improvement and equipment of modern industry bythe reform of the income tax law-; to extend export credit facilities; to maintainthe use or value of assets created at the public expense on requisitioned or other land, and to provide for the maintenance of employment by a better distributionof industry.16. Legislation has been passed to transfer to the Agricultural Ministersresponsibility for forestry, with a view to the preparation of an intensiveafforestation programme; to provide for the continuation of the functions of theMinister of Fuel and Power, and to authorise the appointment of a Minister toorganise and encourage the development of civil aviation.17. I have also given My assent to measures for the adjustment of localgovernment areas in England and Wales; for the conservation of water resources and the better organisation of water supplies, and for the re-development of wardamaged and obsolescent areas and the regulation of the price at which land canbe acquired for public purposes in Scotland.18. With you I thank Almighty God for the victories already granted to us,and I pray that His blessing may attend us in all our undertakings throughout thestrenuous times that lie ahead.* These two sentences depend on whether the Family Allowances Bill is passed beforetiie Prorogation.
