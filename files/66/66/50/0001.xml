IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1945.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 59.25th June, 1945.CABINET.RELAXATION OF RESTRICTIONS  ON DEPARTURE OF BRITISHSUBJECTS FOR OVERSEAS DESTINATIONS.1. Now that the war in Europe is over the general principles on whichcontrol is exercised over the departure of British subjects from this countryrequire immediate review; and I feel it desirable to consult my colleagues on thesituation described below which has been examined by the inter-departmentalOverseas Travel Committee (over which Lord Munster presides) after referenceto the Home Defence Executive. No change in the present system of control ofthe departure of aliens is contemplated.Legislation.2. In peace-time there is no power to prevent a British subject leaving thecountry. At the outbreak of war, the Passenger Traffic Order, 1939, which wasmade by the Home Secretary under D.R. 18, required British subjects to obtainthe leave of an Immigration Officer before proceeding from the United kingdom to a destination outside it, such leave being given only on production of a permitissued by the Passport and Permit Office. Specific classes of British subjects(members of the Forces, Servants of the Crown, Police Officers on duty, &amp;c.) wereexempted from the requirement of obtaining an exit permit. The primary objects of the Defence Regulation were to prevent the departure of persons who mightbe a danger to security or might seek to evade national service. Under the passenger Traffic Order the ultimate control was at the port of embarkation, wherethe examination of passengers was also an indispensable part of censorship and exchange control; but the exit permit system afforded the Security authoritiesan opportunity of examining in advance the records of British subjects desiringto leave the country, and provided machinery for enquiry into this and othermatters before the traveller reached the port.3. Defence Regulation 18 was among the emergency regulations reviewed by the Schuster Committee in 1943 (E.I. (44) 13) and the War Cabinet adopted the Committee&apos;s recommendation that the power to control the departure ofBritish subjects after cease-fire in Europe should be retained until Stage B andshould then be reviewed. The ground for this recommendation (apart fromsecurity) was the need to maintain control of man-power and foreign exchange.The Treasury have now intimated that there is no need to maintain exit permitsfor the purpose of currency and exchange control; examination at the ports will suffice. Where, however, there may be objections to the departure of individualsfor reasons of security or man-power control, prior examination, for which theexit permit system provides, is still necessary to avoid abortive journeys to theport and lengthy examinations there.Exit Permit Policy during the European War.4. From September 1939 to June 1940, the general policy was to allowpersons to travel who could show some good reason for their journey. from january to May 1940, holiday travel to France was allowed. In June 1940, thegeneral principle was laid down that it was the duty of all able-bodied inhabitants of the United Kingdom to stay here and fight it out.   Exceptions to this generalMemorandum by the FIome Secretary.[30122]
principle were allowed, broadly speaking, only if the intending traveller couldestablish (a) that his home was overseas, or (b) that his journey was in the national interest (by securing a, certificate to that effect from a Government Department),or (c) that there were urgent compassionate grounds for the journey. Even if an applicant was prima facie eligible, the grant of an exit permit might be opposed by a Department which had an interest in preventing the departure of particularclasses of individuals, and such objections have had to be weighed by the HomeOffice against the reasons in favour of the journey.With the conclusion of hostilities in Europe the position has changed. Itis no longer a question of &quot;considering whether exceptions can be allowed to ageneral rule against departure. The question is whether departure can be prohibited save on special grounds. The number of British subjects to whosedeparture objection can be taken on man-power grounds is limited. Theremainder are prima facie entitled to leave if they wish. There is no justification for requiring each British subject to show cause why he should be allowed toleave the country : be should be allowed to leave the country unless there aregrounds such as security or man-power grounds for stopping him.Man-power.5. The Ministry of Labour and National Service have now decided that forman-power purposes during the Japanese war it will only be necessary to control the departure of men and women between the ages of 18 and 30. All applicationsfor travel facilities must, therefore, be scrutinised in order to ascertain whetherthe applicant is within the call-up age group, and. if so, reference must be madeto the Ministry of Labour and National Service to ascertain whether there isobjection to the proposed departure. This involves the continuance of an exitpermit system so that travellers can be properly cleared in this respect beforestarting for the port of embarkation.Security.6. The Home Defence Executive on the 11th May, at which the security service and Security Executive were fully represented, reached the conclusionthat subject to the agreement of S.H.A.E.F. (which has since been obtained) therewas no security objection to relaxing the existing control of travel by Britishsubjects pan passu with the relaxations which have already been decided upon asregards censorship. It was agreed, therefore, that it would only be necessary to refer to M.I. 5 for examination for security purposes applications for exit permits forjourneys to those countries with which communications are subject to censorship,and only so long as censorship remains applicable. It has already been announced in the riouse of Commons that there is now no censorship of mails to british dominions and Colonies except to Gibraltar, Canada and Eire, and that censor-ship to Gibraltar, Canada and the United States would cease at VE plus 30. Ithas also decided that for practical purposes censorship of communications to eire should come to an end at VE plus 30. From the security angle, therefore,there is no objection to the departure of a British subject to any part of theEnglish-speaking world. Applications for travel, to other destinations muststill be subject to a security check for the present, but this requirement will be relaxed as censorship on communications to other destinations is abandoned.Futtrre Policy.7. The maintenance of restriction on the personal freedom of movement ofBritish subjects is likely to be strongly criticised in Parliament, and convincingreasons will be needed to justify the continuance of such restrictions as may bethought necessary. As I have already indicated, I do not think they can any longer be justified except on the grounds of man-power and security, and I suggestthat, subject to clearance in these two respects, the time has now come to allow any British subject who wishes to leave the country to do so without scrutiny ofthe reason for his journey.8. I recognise of course that there will be no increase of transport facilitiesfor some time to come, and that a freer grant of exit permits will necessarilymean increased competition for the limited number of passages available. Solong as it was accepted that no one was entitled to travel abroad except.for good reasons, the competition for the available transport was correspondingly limited,and priority was accorded to the most deserving. For reasons which I indicatelater, some Departments are anxious to see control in some form continued forthis purpose.   My own view, however, is that, whatever may be the merits of
such a proposal, the exit permit system is not an appropriate method of rationingtravel, and it would be improper to use for this purpose a Defence Regulationmade for purposes which are entirely different. Official permission to leave thecountry need not be related to the question whether the applicant has a passage,or the necessary exchange to maintain himself abroad, or a visa or permit toenter the country of destination, any more than to the question whether he can afford to pay the fare. Indeed, the staff of the Passport and Permit Office willbe unable to cope with the number of exit permit applications which are already being received, particularly for travel to the Continent, unless the scrutiny to be given to each be limited to the bare essentials, and consideration of extraneousfactors, which are not relevant to the main issue whether an exit permit is to begranted, is excluded.9. My proposal, broadly speaking, therefore, is that as from a given date anexit permit should be issued to any British subject on application provided thereare no security or man-power reasons for preventing his departure. This proposal has received general support from the Foreign Office (especially as regards travel to Western Europe), Colonial Otfice, Dominions Office, and Department of Over-seas Trade, provided that priority in the allocation of passages is given to persons whose journey it is in the national interest to facilitate.10. Objection has, however, been raised by the War Office, to whom themovement of the dependants of a soldier serving overseas is a matter of serious concern, and who would wish that such dependants should be prevented from leaving this country for any destination, lest they should make their way to join the soldier in a station where accommodation for them is lacking or insufficient,or &quot;where for other reasons their presence may be embarrassing. The Air Ministrytake a similar view, but the Admiralty do not wish to restrict travel by the dependants of naval personnel.During 1939-40 before the German offensive in the west, while transport wasplentiful and travel relatively easy, the exit permit machinery was in fact used inthis way, e.g., to prevent wives of men in the B.E.F. from travelling to France toset up house behind the line, or large numbers of dependants travelling to theMiddle East, There may still be cogent departmental reasons, in the interests ofadministration and welfare, for discouraging travel by relatives of military andAir Force personnel; but I could not justify the exercise of the powers under theDefence Regulations to refuse exit permits to the wives of soldiers or airmen assuch, merely because they might try to join their husbands abroad.11. It may be urged that the shortage of transport will inflate fares, andthat to allow the departure of any who can find means to travel and can payextravagant prices would be contrary to public policy; but to attempt to rationforeign travel by requiring each applicant to show that the object of his journeyis one which commends itself to the Government would not be a justifiable use ofDefence Regulations. The objection that the very wealthy would be able to travelfor reasons of pleasure only, and will displace more desetwing persons, seems likely to be met by the Treasury proposals for rationing foreign exchange. TheChancellor of the Exchequer is prepared, I understand, to allow all travellers abasic ration of exchange, and a supplementary ration to business men and others who can establish a need for it.Transport.12. It has already been made clear to the public by an announcement in thepress that no extra travel facilities will be available, and the Ministry of war transport have been considering the problems which would be involved inallocating passages, once the field of potential travellers ceases to be sharplyrestricted. So far as travel to the Continent is concerned, there will probably beample accommodation on cross-Channel services in the near future for as many persons as are likely to obtain visas from the French and Belgian authorities. Itis no doubt for this reason that the Newhaven-Dieppe service, started in January,has seldom been crowded, and that contrary to expectation, there has been nocompetition for places: On transport grounds, therefore, there appears no occasion to restrict travel to the Continent.13. As regards long sea passages the position is different. The Ministryof War Transport consider that the shipping space under their control iiinsufficient even to meet departmental commitments, and I understand that they,therefore, propose that the allocation of passages should be entrusted to a Priority
Passage organisation which they contemplate establishing. So far as the HomeOffice is concerned, I fully support this proposal, and I would only express a hopethat this body will find it possible to allocate passages not only to travellers whosejourneys are sponsored by Government Departments, but to urgent compassionatecases, and that a proportion of passages, however small, will be left to the shipping companies to dispose of to private travellers.Conclusion.14.   The proposals put forward for consideration are  (a) that from the earliest convenient date exit permits from this country for overseas destinations should be granted without scrutiny of the reasonsfor the journey, and subject only to such security and man-powerchecks as may from time to time be required;(b) that a Priority Passage Board  (on the lines of the Air TransportPriorities Board) should be set up under the Ministry of War Trans-port to allocate passages on shipping controlled by the Government to applicants sponsored by Government Departments, and to a small number of urgent compassionate cases, and that the passages soallocated should leave a small residue to be disposed of by shipping and air line companies.D. B. S.Home Office, S.W.1,25th June, 1945.
