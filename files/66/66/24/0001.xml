&quot; 1  V i&apos;&apos;tVvTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1945.SECRET. / Copy No.CP. (45) 24. y8th June, 1945.CABINET.GREECE.Memorandum by the Minister of Education.ON the 12th March the War Cabinet approved proposals drafted byMr. Macmillan for reorganising the British organisation in Greece (W.P. (45) 138of the 5th March, 1945). These proposals provided for the transfer of mostof the responsibilities which had hitherto been exercised by General Scobie toHis Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Athens. They were based on the assumption thatBritish responsibility in Greece must continue for a considerable time if the objects for which the British forces had been sent to Greece and for which theyhad fought in December and January were to be accomplished.2. The transfer of responsibility from General Scobie to His Majesty&apos;s embassy has now been largely accomplished. Problems have arisen, however,which can only be settled if a policy decision is taken, first on the extent to whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government should intervene in Greek internal affairs, and secondly on the extent to which we are prepared to assist the Greeks In response-establishing the economy of their country.3. The most pressing of these problems are due to the rapid deterioration of the financial situation in Greece. There is a serious risk that the new drachmaintroduced last November may go the way of the old. This would mean anotherfinancial breakdown and would inevitably entail the fall of the present GreekGovernment and probably serious civil disorders. The date on which Britishtroops could be withdrawn might well be postponed indefinitely. The rootcause of the deterioration of the financial situation is that the amount of moneycirculating in the country is increasing much more rapidly than the supply ofgoods which can be bought with this money. One remedy would be to increase thescale of imports into Greece. This possibility is considered below, but it mustbe recognised that so long as the present shortage both of goods and shippingcontinues it can only provide a very partial solution. The other remedy whichmust be applied if the situation is to be saved is for the Greek Government toenforce the necessary measures to control the financial situation in the country.4. Except to the limited extent to which imports can be increased, theproblem is therefore an internal one which the Greeks must solve for themselves.An external loan would be of no assistance, since the Greeks have enough foreign exchange for their immediate needs and a loan, or even a money gift, would not affect the currency circulation in Greece itself. The appropriate internalmeasures are obvious enough. There must be the maximum economy in expenditure and the maximum increase in revenue by taxation and any other means. Strict control must also be enforced over wages and prices. The GreekGovernment are naturally finding it difficult to carry through these &quot; austerity &quot;measures, partly because they are bound to be unpopular so long as the Greekpeople do not realise the need for them and partly because the administrativemachine is inefficient and inadequate.5. In this field our assistance must of necessity be limited. To some extentwe may be able to supply technical advice; for instance, His Majesty&apos;s Embassyhave asked for a publicity expert who could explain to the Greek people, as hasbeen done over here, the economic and financial problems facing the country andthe need for Government controls.   There is obvious danger, however, in any12793   [29948]
2attempt to pass from advisory to executive action. Except in certain limitedfields, e.g., the Police, British experts should not attempt to run the Greek adminis-tration. Any such attempt would meet with resistance from the Greeks them-selves and would amount to establishing a virtual British protectorate over thecountry.6. There is one field, however, in which our advice may be of great value,namely, the size of the Greek Armed Forces. Our representatives in Athens have asked for guidance and the views of the Chiefs of Staff are being sought on certain aspects of this question. The Armed Forces, especially the Army, impose a direct burden on the Greek budget and also impede the recovery of the country by withdrawing men from productive employment. On financial grounds,- there-fore, it is essential that Greek forces should be kept down to the minimum requiredfor the maintenance of internal security. This means that for some time Greecemust be inferior in military power to Yugoslavia and even Bulgaria, and thatshe would not be in a position to defend the country against external attack.This is admittedly unsatisfactory, but if the Armed Forces were immediatelyincreased to give Greece parity with her neighbours and to guarantee the country&apos;s security the extra burden would lead to a financial breakdown, the consequences of which would be even more serious.7. Once the size of the Greek forces has been determined, it must be decidedhow far we should assist in equipping and maintaining them. We have in generalrecognised that it is our responsibility to provide the necessary material, andin the case of the Army we have undertaken to supply initial equipment for100,000 men without payment. There does not appear, however, to be any good reason why we should continue to maintain these forces free of charge. the greeks have adequate reserves of sterling and could afford to pay us. It is sug-gested, therefore, that they should be asked to pay for the maintenance, as distinct from the initial equipment, of their Armed Forces.8. As regards imports into Greece, the bulk of the supplies which will beprovided during the next six or twelve months must come from U.N.R.R.A. Itis clear, however, that the E) .N.R.R.A. programme will not cover some of Greece&apos;sneeds, e.g., railway reconstruction, and imports both of these materials and of anyother goods in addition to the U.N.R.R.A. programmes would also be of great value in reducing the risk of inflation. The Greek Government should be ableto pay for such imports, but our assistance and that of the united States Govern-ment will be needed if supplies and shipping are to be made available.9.   The conclusions may be stated as follows:  (1) It is in our interest on political and strategic grounds that stabilityshould be established and maintained in Greece under a Governmentfriendly to ourselves. This was the main object for which Britishtroops were sent to Greece, and our assistance to the country will haveto continue for some time if this is to be achieved.(2) The solution of the problems with wdiich the country is faced rests,however, with the Greeks themselves. We should only assist in an advisory capacity; but we should do our utmost to ensure that ouradvice is carried out. We must avoid any measures which wouldinvolve us in taking over the Greek administration.(3) The strength of the Greek Armed Forces should be based on the minimum required to maintain internal security in the country. The Greeksshould be asked to pay for the maintenance of these forces. In additionto relieving us of a substantial commitment, this would probablymake the Greek Government more ready to acquiesce in a modesttotal for their forces.(4) Every attempt should be made to increase the quantity of importsreaching Greece. This means that we should support U.KR.R.A.&apos;srequests for supplies and shipping and also do our best to providesupplies and shipping for purchases by the Greek Government orby Greek importers.R. K. L.Foreign Office, 8th June, 1945.
