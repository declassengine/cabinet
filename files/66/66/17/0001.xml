Fleet Carriers.At the beginning of this period all the Fleet Carrierswere fully operational and with the British PacificFleet, except HALS. Formidable which was working up at Colombo after undergoing extensive repairs and h.M.S. Implacable refitting at Rosyth prior to sailingfor the Pacific.H.M.S. Illustrious In support of the American landings on Okinawa,H.M.S. Indomitable these Carriers have carried out a series of strikes againstH.M.S. Victorious the Sakishima group of islands beginning with a two-H.M.S. day offensive at Myako and Ishigaki on the 26th andIndefatigable 27th March. 574 sorties were flown; all airfields,barracks and installations were heavily bombed andstrafed and the town of Omaha was left in flames. Overtwenty aircraft were destroyed on the ground and one inthe air. Coastal vessels were also attacked, one beingsunk and several damaged. The opposition consisted of moderate to heavy flak which cost us six aircraft. Afurther eleven aircraft were lost from other causesincluding the effects of enemy action.Operations were resumed against these two islandson the 31st March and continued till the 2nd April.At dawn on the 1st, ten enemy aircraft attacked theFleet and our fighters. accounted for four of them.One of the attackers hit HALS. Indefatigable in asuicide dive, destroying a number of her aircraft ondeck and another bombed and damaged the destroyerUlster. During the afternoon the enemy tried to stagehis aircraft through the Sakishima islands in an effort to attack the main forces at Okinawa but was frustratedwhen we destroyed fourteen of his aircraft on theground and damaged six more. The following morningfour enemy aircraft again attempted to attack the Fleet.They caused no damage and lost two of their numbershot down. We retaliated with fighter sweeps overIshigaki and Miyako where twenty-two aircraft were destroyed and nine damaged.[29989] b
2The Task Force then stood off until the 6th Aprilwhen the third in this series of strikes was launched.Airfields were still the primary targets and were wellbombed and strafed. One &quot;Francis&quot; was shot down.An attack was made on the Fleet during the afternoonby four suicide aircraft. Two were shot down by fighters and a third by fighters and ships&apos; guns combined whilethe fourth hit the island of H.M.S. Illustrious with itswing tip and crashed into the sea. Despite heavy cloud,further successful strikes were made against these islands on the following clay. The total enemy lossesduring this third series were five airborne and threegrounded aircraft destroyed with many others damaged.- . Our losses were two in combat and twelve by other causes,including; enemy action.On the 12th and 13th the attack was switched to twoairfields in Northern Formosa. Bad weather prevented the observation of results but sixteen Japanese fighterswhich attempted to intercept were shot down and fivedamaged. The next day damage was caused to an ammunition store, a train, a factory and a railway bridge and twenty aircraft were destroyed. The enemy madethree unsuccessful attacks on the Fleet, losing two air-craft to our fighters and another to ships&apos; gunfire.HATS. Formidable       On  the   14th  April,   HALS.   Formidable   relievedHALS. Illustrious and the Illustrious retired to Leyteto effect repairs. She will shortly sail to the UnitedKingdom for further repairs and a refit.After replenishing in the service area, the Force struckagain at these islands on the 16th and 17th with airfieldsas the main target. Four airborne enemy aircraft were shot down.The Force returned to the attack on the 20th with further strikes at the airfields. They were all rendered unservicable for the expenditure of 75 tons of bombs.The enemy had no aircraft airborne and few freshtargets were seen on the ground. The Barracks and apossible radar station at Iromoto were left in flames.The Force then retired to Leyte for a rest, arrivingthere on the 23rd.So far during these.operations, the first we have under-taken with the American 5th Fleet, our fighters haveshot down 32^ enemy aircraft with others damaged andon the ground, destroyed more than 79 and damaged over20. Ships&apos; gunfire shot down, another 1^. These losses in aircraft have so far prevented the enemy interferingfrom the South with the Okinawa landing operations.H.M.S. Implacable       Is at present working up at Trincomalee and will shortly join the British Pacific Fleet.2. Light Fleet Carriers.HALS. Colossus These ships have been working up in the Mediter-H.M.S. Venerable    ranean.HALS. VengeanceHALS. Glory This carrier was commissioned on the 21st February.H.M.S. Pioneer This aircraft maintenance ship, which is a convertedLight Fleet carrier, is now on passage to join the BritishPacific Fleet.3. Escort Carriers.(i) Five Escort Carriers, HAL Ships Campania, Nairana, Trumpeter,Vindex and Premier have shared the duty of protecting convoys between theUnited Kingdom and Russia.J.W. 64 of 28 ships with the Campania and the Nairana sailed for Russiaon the 5th February. The following day an enemy aircraft sighted the convoyand was shot down by Wildcats, but the enemy were on the alert and next morning several groups of Ju. 88s tried for an hour and a half without success
to penetrate the convoy screen. No damage was done to the convoy or its escortsand one Ju. 88 was shot down. On the morning of the 10th the enemy triedagain; upwards of twenty torpedo aircraft made determined attacks, still with no success, and lost seven of their number destroyed with others damaged. Welost one Wildcat. No further attacks were made, the convoy arriving intact atKola Inlet on the 13th February.The return convoy of 30 ships with the same escorting carriers left Kolaon the 19th February on a journey full of incident. U-boats attacked on the first day damaging a U.S. Ship which had to put back. . Very heavy weather was then encountered which broke up the convoy and forced it to heave toabout 100 miles north of the North Cape. The next day, before the convoyhad properly reformed, the enemy returned to the attack with twenty-five ormore Ju. 88s. carrying torpedoes, a fine piece of flying in the prevailing con-ditions, but they were beaten off without loss to the convoy and three of them were destroyed, two by our fighters and the other by ships&apos; gunfire. The weatherthen deteriorated to gale conditions again and once more the convoy wasscattered. It reformed west of the Lofoten Islands but three ships straggledand one of them was torpedoed and sunk by enemy aircraft about fifty milesfrom the convoy. Most of the passengers and crew were rescued and the convoycontinued on its way without further harm.HM. Ships Campania and Trumpeter escorted the twenty-five ships com-prising J.W. 65 when they sailed for Murmansk on the 13th March. Thepassage was uneventful until the last day but one when, while in the approaches to Kola Inlet, an attack by U-boats resulting in the sinking of one merchant ship and serious damage to another.R.A. 65, the return convoy of twenty-six ships, was unmolested, reaching theUnited Kingdom on. the 1st April.The latest Russia-bound convoy to sail was J.W. 66 of forty-two merchant ship? escorted by H.M. Ships Vindex and Premier. It left on the 21st april and arrived safely on the 26th. The return convoy, R.A. 66, sailed from KolaInlet on the 29th.(ii) Three mining strikes have been carried out in Norwegian waters by aircraft from H.M. Ships Puncher, Premier, Queen and Searcher.On the 12th February, Premiers Avengers, escorted by Wildcats fromPuncher and Premier, laid five mines in Salhustrommen. Flak batteries whichopened up were severely dealt with by the Wildcats.These same carriers provided air cover for a minesweeping force on the21st February and on the following day mined Salhustrommen. In the face ofintense and accurate light flak, Barracudas escorted by Wildcats, laid sevenmines which, as shown by photographs taken at the time, effectively blocked thechannel. The Wildcats attacked waterfront buildings at Stavanger and nearbyradar and W/T aerials and destroyed a D.O. 24 on the water. Two Barracudaswere lost.HM. Ships Premier, Queen and Searcher carried out the next strike on the20th March, when their aircraft laid seven mines in Granesund. opposition was weak and we suffered no losses.(iii) Anti-shipping operations in Norwegian waters have been continued.H.M. Ships Searcher, Puncher, Q,ueen and Nairana sailed from Scapa onthe 24th March to carry out sustained day and night strikes against coastal shipping. During daylight on the 26th, Avengers from H.M.S. Queen, escorted by Wildcats from H.M.S. Searcher and H.M.S. Puncher, searched the leadsbetw-een Trondheim and Kristiansund and found a 4,000 to 5,000-ton tankerand a minesweeper, which were attacked and damaged. About ten Me. 109 Fs.or Gs. tried to attack the Avengers, but were intercepted by our Wildcats whichdestroyed three and damaged two more without loss to themselves. The weatherdeteriorated towards evening and the intended night operation by Barracudasand Swordfish had to be abandoned, but a slight improvement the following-morning made it just possible for a fighter-bomber strike of Wildcats to be flown off with a Firefly as navigational leader. They delivered an attack on shipping alongside at Aalesund, but no results were seen. Several flak positionswere silenced and Vikero Island wireless station was strafed. There were nolosses.(iv) Two operations have been mounted by Escort Carriers of the East IndiesFleet.From the 26th February to the 4th March FI.M. Ships Empress and Ameer.with the cruiser Kenya and  destroyers, stood off Northern Sumatra while[29989] b 2
Hellcats from the Empress carried out an extensive photographic reconnaissance of Kra Isthmus, Pen an g and North Sumatra. The planned areas were wellcovered and 40,000 leaflets were dropped. Two Oscars and a Dinah, which at various times approached too near the Force, were promptly shot clown by thecombat air patrol from H.M.S. Ameer.   None of our aircraft was lost.On the 11th April the battleships Queen Elizabeth and Richelieu and the cruiser London carried out a successful bombardment of Sabang with Hellcatsfrom the Escort Carriers Emperor and Khedive, spotting fall of shot and providing air cover. Nine Oscars and a Dinah attacked the Force but did no damage. The. Dinah and one of the Oscars were shot down by our Hellcatswithout loss. On the 14th and 15th H.M.S. Emperor $ Hellcats covered thewhole area with a photographic reconnaissance for the loss of one aircraft. OneOscar was shot clown on the 15th. The following day Avengers and Hellcatsfrom these carriers struck at Emmahaven and Packing, where a 4,000-ton merchant ship and a marine workshop were hit; one Oscar was shot down by our fmhters and three Dinahs were damaged on the ground.(v) The Escort Carrier Force of the East Indies Fleet has been considerablystrengthened by the addition of the Assault Carriers Emperor. Khedive, Stalkerand Hunter, the first two of which have already been on operations. H.M. ShipsShall and Begum have been oft: the station for some time, the former refitting inDurban and the latter in the United Kingdom, but both are now rejoining.Another Assault Carrier, HALS. A Hacker is also joining the Fleet.(vi) Two further Escort Carriers, H.M. Ships Chaser and Ruler, joined the British Pacific Fleet during this period and are being used on replenishmentduties. H.M. Ships Slinger, Speaker, Striker and Fencer are with the Fleet,the first three having taken part in the operations against Sakishima, while thelast has been fully employed as a Ferry Carrier. HALS. Unicorn, the aircraftrepair ship, joined the Fleet early in February.(vii) Four Escort Carriers are now temporarily under United States Com-mand for ferrying duties. These are H.M. Ships Atheling, Rajah, Tracker andRanee. H.M. Ships Reaper and Pa.troiler were also so engaged until recently,but the growth of the British Pacific Fleet, entailing heavier ferrying require-ments, necessitated their withdrawal from duty with the United States Navy.(viii) H.M. Ships Activity and Battler have been fully employed as aircrafttransports. HALS. Battler has now become a Training Carrier, and her place as a transport will be taken by the Escort Carrier Archer, which has beenbrought into service as a merchant fleet auxiliary and renamed Empire Lagan.(ix) Deck-landing training has been carried out by HAL Ships Ravagerand Smiter, and latterly by HALS. Battler. In the last three months 375 pupilshave qualified and 72 have been given refresher courses.(x) HALS. Pretoria Castle continues in active employment as the TrialsCarrier.4. M.A .C. Ships.Swordfish from these small carriers continued to provide anti-submarineprotection for most of the Atlantic convoys which sailed during this period.In all 52 convoys have been covered by these 15 ships.A Swordfish from one of them, the Empire Macandrew, while on a patrolround convoy ON. 298 on the 26th April delivered a promising attack on aU-boat.Section II. Detached Naval Squadrons Operating from Shore Bases.5. One squadron of Swordfish and three squadrons of Barracudas operated with Coastal Command during this period. The Swordfish squadron, after ayear&apos;s excellent service with this Command, operating both from this country andfrom Belgium, was withdrawn at the end of February. One of the Barracudasquadrons with withdrawn on the 15th March.During the period covered by this report, these aircraft have flown 1,094sorties on anti-submarine patrols and night bombing attacks on the enemy&apos;sE/R boats and coastal craft. In the large majority of cases bombing results were unobserved, but successes were claimed against these difficult and elusivetargets.In addition 17 attacks were made on midget submarines and it is consideredthat two were sunk and others damaged.
GOSection III. Aircraft and Equipment.6. British Aircraft.(i) The Seafire Mk. XV is now being produced in sufficient numbers for thefirst squadron to be formed.The Seafire Mk. XVII, which has the improved rear-view fuselage and ismodified to carry two cameras for army support work, is to have a new engine the Griffon 37-and this version will be known as the Mark XVIII. A slight increase in maximum speed is expected.(ii) The fighters Sea Hornet and Sea Fury have now both flown successfullywith arrester gear installed.(iii) The Fairey 05/43, the aircraft which will replace the Barracuda, isexpected to fly in May.   The Mosquito 33 prototype should be flying then also.7. American Aircraft.No changes of substance have been reported since the last Memorandumexcept for some design alterations to the latest Grumman Avengers involving theremoval of the turret and the tunnel gun position. The cleaner fuselage will resultin an increased performance.B. B.Admiralty, S.W. 1,1st June, 1945.APPENDIX I.Wastage.
