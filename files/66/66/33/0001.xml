Draft King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :The present Parliamentary session, which 1 am now bringing to a close,has seen the final overthrow and unconditional surrender of our enemies inEurope. Their leaders, almost without exception, are either dead by their ownhand or held in Allied custody. At last, after more than five years of mortalstrife, Europe is liberated from the foul tyranny that threatened to enslave it.This deliverance is due not only to the resolution with which My people in these islands have carried on the struggle, but also to the stalwart aid so freely givenby the peoples and governments of My Commonwealth and Empire overseas, tothe splendid Armies, Fleets and Air Forces of the United States and the vastsupplies which they have afforded, and to the heroic deeds of the Forces of much-suffering Russia. I must also express My deep admiration for the exertionsof all those other Allies who fought by our side on sea. land and in the air andof the resistance of their peoples, now happily restored to their former inde-pendence. So persistent, so widespread and so united a co-operation of states to rescue European freedom from a hideous menace has never before&apos; been seen in the history of the world. I, with all My peoples, take pride in the thoughtthat.it was we who stood alone to face the foe in the darkest days, and who nowshare in the common triumph.It has given The Queen and Myself particular pleasure to have been ableto visit My loyal subjects in the Channel Islands; and I rejoice that they, whosuffered so long under the German invader, are once more free.I have already had an opportunity, in replying to your loyal Addressesof Congratulation, to pay tribute to all that has been done by My peoples, whether in the Armed Forces or in any of the other forms of national endeavour. It is awonderful record of constancy, faith and courage in every part of our national life and a striking manifestation of the historic character and quality of the british people.My thoughts have been constantly with the peoples of the commonwealth and Empire whose lands still suffer from the tyrannous Japanese occupation andwith all others who have experienced the same calamity. The resounding victorygained in Burma and the swift advances made in the Pacific by the powerful. Forces of the United States, who, together with Forces from these islands andfrom Australia, New Zealand and other parts of My Dominions, are closing inon Japan, have brought nearer their liberation. Though heavy labours andtribulations may still lie ahead, the downfall of our enemy in Europe enables usto bend all our energies to the task, which we shall share with our Allies, ofcrushing the aggressor in the Far East.The grievous sacrifices which My peoples and My gallant Allies havehad to bear in these long years of war will not have been in vain if they lead tothe establishment of a new world order based upon justice and respect for human rights, and equipped to crush any future attempt to disturb the peace of theworld. At San Francisco My Ministers have striven to further the framing of aninternational organisation by which future generations may be spared from thehorrors of war.My Government have authorised the Governor-General of India to invitethe participation of Indian political leaders in the Government of British India,I earnestly hope that this invitation will be accepted, so that the immediate tasks of the waging of the war against Japan and the post-war development of Indiamay be undertaken with the full co-operation of. all sections of Indian publicopinion.I have assented with great satisfaction to the Colonial Development and welfare (Amendment) Act, which both substantially increases the amount ofmoney to be made available to assist colonial development and prolongs the periodof assistance. The resources so provided will be of the greatest help to colonial governments in those plans which they are now preparing to improve theconditions and standards of living of the peoples in their territories.Members of the House of Commons :I thank you for the provision which you have made towards the heavy costof conducting the war and the cost of the&quot;public services.
My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :Plans have been completed for the orderly release of men and women from the Armed Forces under a scheme which ensures fair treatment to servingmen and women, and there has been a recent relaxation of the control over theemployment of labour. Much progress has also been made with the arrange-ments&quot; for training men and women released from the Forces or from industrialwar work and for compensating and resettling those who are disabled as a resultof their service.Steps have been taken, in close co-operation with the Governments of theUnited States, Canada and other Dominions, to overcome the grave shortages in world supplies of many essential foods. These shortages make yet more necessary the vigorous and sustained efforts of the agricultural community and the men ofthe fishing fleets in providing food for My people.The destruction of our homes by the enemy and the urgent need to con-concentrate our manpower for nearly six years on tasks directly connected withthe prosecution of the war have led to a* widespread shortage of houses. general   -getic measures have already been taken to restore houses damaged by enemy attack and to prepare housing sjtes. and the maximum effort is being devoted to theproduction and erection of new houses. To this end arrangements have beenmade to augment the number of those available for house building both by special releases of building workers from other industries and from the armed forces and by the training of new recruits for the building industry.I have given My assent to a number of measures which have been brought before you during the course of the year.Legislation has been passed to provide for a scheme of family allowances, inwhich the families of serving men will be included. A measure has been passed to assist employers and workpeople in securing the wider observance of jointlyagreed terms and conditions of employment and in maintaining reasonablestandards of remuneration. A much needed reform has been effected in the lawconcerning contributory negligence.. Henceforward a claimant who proves thathis injury is due to anothers fault will not fail to secure some compensationmerely because a certain degree of fault is attributable to him. Among the bills relating to Scotland which have received My assent is a measure to amend the law relating to education and to introduce reforms which will promote the progressive development of the educational system.Provision has been made for the resumption of local elections, and reformshave been made in the law relating to the representation of the people. effect has been given to the Report of the Boundary Commission for England regardingthe division of abnormally large constituencies.Measures have been passed to finance capital expenditure incurred bylocal authorities; to assist the improvement and equipment of modern industry bythe reform of the income tax law; to extend export credit facilities; to maintainthe use or value of assets created at the public expense on requisitioned or other land, and to provide for the maintenance of employment by a better distributionof industry.Legislation has been passed to transfer to the Agricultural Ministersresponsibility for forestry, with a view to promoting schemes of intensiveafforestation; for continuing the functions of the Minister of Fuel and Power;and for the appointment of a Minister of Civil Aviation.I have also given My assent to measures for the adjustment of localgovernment areas in England and Wales; for the conservation of water resources and the better organisation of water supplies, and for the re-development of wardamaged and obsolescent areas and the regulation of the price at which land canbe acquired for public purposes in Scotland.With you I thank Almighty God for the victories already granted to us,and I pray that His blessing may attend us in all our undertakings throughout thestrenuous times that lie ahead.
