THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the CaCabinet.June 1945.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 16.5th June, 1945.CABINET.REPARATIONS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE Ministerial Committee on Reparations set up by the last Government,of which I was Chairman, were asked as their first task to prepare and submit to the War Cabinet draft instructions to the United Kingdom representatives on the forthcoming Reparations Conference at Moscow (W.P. (45) 248, para-graph 3). The Committee met once, considered the main points on which our representatives require instructions, and decided at their next meeting toconsider the draft of a report to the War Cabinet.2. The draft report was prepared, but the Committee had no opportunity toconsider it. In present circumstances, I think it would be most convenient thatI should submit it directly to the Cabinet for their consideration. The draft report, which is attached at Annex II, is in conformity with the Committee&apos;views, though it also embodies the recommendations of officials on a number of minor matters which the Committee did not have time to consider.3. I am in agreement with the recommendations contained in the draft report, except for one point. The Committee approved the general principle thatobjects taken by the Germans from occupied territories, which can be identified as such, should be restored, provided that they existed prior to enemy occupationof the country concerned; but they considered that, as an exception to this general principle, all gold found in Germany, whether or not it is identified as havingbeen looted from our Allies, should be divided up among the countries entitled toreparation in the normal reparation percentages. This view, the reasons which led the Committee to adopt it, and one special case in which they proposed to admit the principle of restitution, are recorded in paragraphs 44 and 45 of thedraft report.4. However, in a letter which he wrote to me on the 5th May (R.M. (45) 2),the former Minister of State informed me that, in his view, it would be impossibleto allow this decision to stand for several reasons, more particularly because allthe European Allies attach the highest importance to the recovery of theiridentifiable gold, and the United Kingdom Delegate to the European advisory commission, acting on the basis of a previous decision of Ministers, had circulatedto the Commission a memorandum on restitution which made no reservation inregard to gold. The Committee did not have an opportunity of discussing this letter; but in the light of our commitment on the European Advisory Commission,I would suggest that the Committee&apos;s recommendation on this matter shouldbe abandoned.5. I attach, as Annex I, a draft directive for the United kingdom representative on the Moscow Commission, which summarises the conclusions ofthe draft report (amended as I have suggested in paragraph 4).6. I suggest that the Dominion Governments should at once be informed by telegram of the general line which we propose to instruct our Delegation to vtakeand should be given an opportunity of commenting, if they wish to do so.Dominion Governments will be concerned from two main aspects: (a) generalpolicy in relation to the treatment of Germany, and (b) their own position in
2relation to reparations. As regards (&amp;), it is clear that, under the criteria for reparation laid down in the Yalta Protocol, the Dominions must be regarded aspotential recipients, but it is possible that they may not wish in practice to make more than token claims, and it would be useful to elicit their views before thediscussions at Moscow begin. Similar considerations apply also to India, andan enquiry on these lines should be made of the Government of India at thesame time.7.   I therefore invite my colleagues (a) to approve the draft directive attached as Annex I; and(b) to agree that the Dominion Governments and the Government of india should be informed of the general lines of the instructions to our representatives, and should be given an opportunity of commenting,if they wish to do so.J. A.Treasury Chambers. S.W. 1,5th June. 1945.ANNEX I.Draft Directive for the United Kingdom Representative on the moscow Commission on Reparations.The function of the Reparation Commission, as described in paragraph 3of the Protocol signed at Yalta, is to work out, on the principles laid down inparagraph &quot;2 of that Protocol, a detailed plan for the exaction of reparationfrom Germany. The views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the main points whichwill arise in the preparation of this plan are contained in the following para-graphs. His Majesty&apos;s Government will, however, require to reconsider certain aspects of the problem in the event of Germany being dismembered or of an area in the west of Germany being put under international control. Moreover, inthe opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, security is more important thanreparation; and it is essential that, until agreement has been reached on a policy for stripping Germany of her war potential, decisions taken on reparation shouldnot prejudice that policy. Equally, in some respects at least, it will be difficult toreach final conclusions until Germany&apos;s frontiers, are settled. You should, there-fore, regard the instructions contained in the following paragraphs as being tothis extent provisional; and, whilst you should aim at reaching agreement overas much of the field as possible, it may be necessary, over part of it, for you to confine yourself to an exchange of views and to return without reaching final agreement.The Amount of Reparation.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government regard it as a basic principle that the full requirements of the Allied forces of occupation and the essential minimum requirements of the German population should be a first charge on german assets and on German production (whether production for home consumptionor production for export to the extent necessary to pay for approved imports).It follows from this principle that agreement must, so far as possible, be reached on the Control Commission regarding common standards to be adopted for thelevel of consumption for the civilian population of Germany. The detailed application of this must rest, in each zone, with the Commander who is responsiblefor seeing that the objectives of the occupation are carried out and must have full powers of decision as to the requirements of his forces.3. The second basic principle is that payment for any relief and other supplies from abroad, which are sent into Germany with the approval of the occupying Powers, should be a first charge on any deliveries which Germany asa whole may make, and you should secure acceptance of this. It may, however,be impossible to make this charge effective against once-for-all deliveries andreparation labour.
SI4. Subject to these principles and to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Governmenton certain less important matters on which you will receive separate instructions,His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the amount of reparation to be exactedfrom Germany within each of the categories and for the periods to be fixed,should be as large as possible.5. At the Crimea Conference the Soviet Delegation proposed a globalfigure of 20 million dollars for physical deliveries (excluding labour). TheAmerican Delegation agreed that the Reparation Commission should take this figure as a basis for discussion in its initial studies; but the British Delegationrecorded their view that, pending consideration of the reparation question by the moscow Reparation Commission, no figures of reparation should be mentioned.As at present advised, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the figure of20 million dollars is far too high. But they believe it would be unwise and indeedimpracticable to settle on a definite figure until more information is available as to Germany&apos;s capacity, and decisions have been taken on the numerous questionswhich will affect her ability to make reparations, including especially the effectof security decisions upon Germany&apos;s industrial structure..6. On the other hand, it is desirable that a figure should be fixed as soonas the necessary data are available. On this point, therefore, you should takethe line that His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that a global figure shouldbe fixed when there is a satisfactory basis for doing so, but that, at this stage,they feel it impossible to say what the figure should be or when it should be fixed.Types and periods of Reparation.7. Paragraph 2 of the protocol lays down that reparation in kind is tobe exacted from Germany in the three following forms  (a) Once-for-all deliveries.(b) Deliveries from current production.(c) Labour.8. Once-for-all deliveries. These removals are stated in the protocol tobe intended to be carried out chiefly for the purpose of &quot; destroying the war potential of Germany.&quot; This is an important principle, but it does not mean that once-for-all deliveries will be confined to assets which are important fromthe point of view of economic security, only that these wall be the first and mostobvious choice.9. The protocol lays down two years from the surrender of Germany orthe cessation of organised resistance for the completion of the programme ofonce-for-all deliveries. It is most desirable that this should be adhered to, evenif it means that the programme which may be fixed cannot be completed.10. Deliveries from current production. These are described in the protocolas &quot; annual deliveries of goods from current production for a period to be fixed.&quot;In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government they should be limited to a specifiedlist of raw materials and semi-manufactured goods. Coal, potash, timber, cementand bricks should be included. Food and feeding-stuffs should be excluded unless(which is most unlikely) a surplus of any of them is developed in excess of the approved requirements of Germany considered as a whole. You are authorisedto agree, if pressed, to include steel; but you should not yourself propose its inclusion.11. At the Crimea Conference, the Soviet Delegation proposed a 10-year period for current deliveries. You should accept this proposal, subject to &quot;pro-vision for reconsideration after the end of 5 years. It is, however, the provisionalview of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the start of the programme of deliveries from current production as free reparation should be delayed until after theend of the 2-year period of once-for-all deliveries i.e., that all deliveries from current production during those 2 years should be paid for.12. Labour. The following are the points to which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment attach greatest importance in regard to reparation labour : -(a) The impressment of reparation labour should be completed within ashort period and thereafter no further labour should be taken, even for replacements.
it(b) Reparation labour need not be taken solely from among Germans whowere prisoners-of-war at the time of the surrender; nor need they be taken solely from among active Nazis.(c) You should propose that all countries taking reparation should signa declaration in regard to the conditions under which the labour willbe employed. This declaration should lay down certain uniformminimum standards as to food, lodging, medical treatment, workingpay and period of service.Allocation of Reparation.13. The protocol lays down that &quot; reparations are to be received in the firstinstance by those countries which have borne the main burden of the war, have suffered the heaviest losses and have organised victory over the enemy.&quot; TheSoviet Delegation proposed that 50 per cent, of the total reparations should go 10the U.S.S.R. The American Delegation agreed that this figure should be takenby the Moscow Commission as a basis for discussion in its initial studies. TheBritish Delegation undertook no commitment in this respect.14. You should not agree unconditionally to the allocation to Russia alone ofany specific percentage. The Powers represented at Moscow should agree among themselves the percentages which they will advocate for the various claimants; but no percentage should be finally fixed except as part of a general agreement between all the claimant countries. The Commission should attempt to secure this generalagreement by associating with their work, at a suitable stage, those of the other united Nations who are mainly concerned.15. Labour will be an important part of reparation and, in determining the percentages of physical deliveries, the Commission should give full weight tothe amount of labour to be received by each claimant country. No attempt should,however, he made to put a value on labour and to include it in the percentageallocation itself.16. You will be informed as soon as possible of the provisional views of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in regard to percentages which should be allocated to thevarious claimant countries; and you will be provided with all available statisticaldata bearing on this point.17. There is no need for each class of reparation delivery to be dividedamong the claimant countries in exact proportion to their general quota. Thekind of deliveries to be taken by each country within its quota should be settled bythe Inter-Allied Reparation Commission (see paragraph 22 below), so far aspossible in accordance with the wishes of the claimant countries. It will be toour advantage that ships should be divided up amongst the claimants in proportion to shipping losses, and not in the general reparation proportions. You should press for this and can concede the same,treatment for rolling-stock and for live-stock.A ustria.18. His Majesty&apos;s Government see no reason of principle why Austriashould not pay reparation; but the question whether she can afford to pay any, and what form it should take, requires further consideration, having regard to herneed for essential imports and to the express intention of the four Powers toestablish her as an independent State. The arguments against fixing a figure atthe present time are even stronger in the case of Austria than in the case ofGermany.Restitution.19. It is the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that restitution [i.e., restora-tion in toto outside the reparation settlement) should be confined to the restorationof identifiable property which existed prior to enemy occupation of the country concerned, in so far as it can be recovered and irrespective of the form of dispos&quot;-session by which it has come into enemy hands. Except as regards works of art.His Majesty&apos;s Government ^reject the thesis that assets looted by the Germanswhich cannot be traced and identified should be replaced out of existing german assets in priority to reparation.20. Italy and the satellites should receive restitution of identifiable assetsto the same extent as the Allies, provided that assets so recovered are dealt within accordance with any reparation conditions imposed on those countries.
The Machinery for executing the Reparation Plan.21. The general administration of Germany will be conducted through theAllied Control Commission which will be the supreme authority. This bodywill have the executive responsibility for determining the approved programmeof imports into Germany, for arranging the charge of the cost of imports on&quot;exports,&quot; for ascertaining what is available for delivery as reparations, andfor arranging for its procurement and delivery to the German frontier. Includedin the machinery of the Allied Control Commission there will be the appropriateDivision for carrying out these duties in regard to reparation, and also in regardto restitution.22. But it is the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that machinery ofdifferent constitution and function will be required to interpret the reparationsplan to administer general policy, and in particular to allocate deliveries betweenthe different claimants. For this purpose you should propose to establish a semi-permanent Inter-Allied Reparation Commission on which all countriesentitled to receive reparations should be represented. It will be necessary toensure, e.g., by giving plural votes to the four occupying Powers, that the minorPowers cannot use their representation upon it to upset the reparation policy or the policy of the occupying Powers towards Germany as executed through theAllied Control Commission.23. As the Allied Control Commission and the Inter-Allied ReparationCommission will have to work closely together on matters of day-to-day businessyou should press strongly that the two bodies should physically be located neareach other in Germany.ANNEX II.Draft Report of the Ministerial Committee on Reparations.I. The Task of the Commission.1. The Reparation Commission is to be set up in Moscow, in accordance withthe terms of the Protocol which was agreed at the Moscow Conference (for textsee Annex III), for the working out, on the principles set out in the Protocol, of a detailed plan for the exaction of reparation from Germany. In preparing theplan, the delegation should make it clear (a) that His Majesty&apos;s Government will require to reconsider certain aspectsof the reparation problem in the event of Germany being dis-membered, or of an area in the West of Germany being put under international control; and(b) that, when the Commission has worked out the detailed plan in accord-ance with the terms of the Protocol, and it has been approved by theGovernments represented on the Commission, arrangements will haveto be made for it to be submitted for the agreement of the other Alliesmainly concerned; this can most conveirfmtly be done by associatingthem with the work of the Moscow Commission at a suitable stage.2. The delegation should aim at reaching agreement over as much of thefield as possible; but it may not be practicable to cover the whole. We endorse the view expressed by the Armistice and Post-War Committee (A.P.W. (45)11th meeting, item 1), that security is more important than reparation. If wehave not reached agreement on our policy for stripping Germany of her war potential, by the time that the Moscow Commission is at work, we must take no decisions on reparation which will prejudce this policy. Equally, in some respectsat least, it will be difficult to reach final conclusions until Germany&apos;s frontiers are settled. It may, therefore, be necessary for our delegation to confine themselves,over part of the field, to an exchange of views and return without reaching final agreement.   This cannot be determined till the time comes.II. Types and Periods of Reparation.3. Once-for-all deliveries. These removals are stated in the Protocol to beintended to be carried out chiefly for the purpose of &apos;&apos; destroying the war potential of Germany.&quot; This is an important principle, but it does not mean that once-for-all deliveries will be confined to assets which are important from the point of viewof economic security, only that these will be the first and most obvious choice.
G4. The Russians have shown, in their dealings with the satellite countries,a tendency to give a wide definition to booty. Unless agreement is reached to thecontrary, they may claim to seize as booty, outside the reparation settlement, manykinds of assets not merely weapons of war which fall into their hands. It is toour interest that as much as possible should be brought into the pool and dividedin the agreed proportions, and our delegation should therefore aim at a fairlynarrow agreed definition of booty.5. The Protocol lays down two years from the surrender of Germany or the cessation of organised resistance for the completion of the programme of once-for-all deliveries. It is most desirable that this should be adhered to, even if it means that in the event we fail to complete the programme which may have been fixed.Exceptions to this would have to be made if it could be shown that delay had beenwilfully caused by the Germans, or in the case of any plant which had been ear-marked for removal but which could not be transported out of Germany in thecourse of the two years.6. Deliveries from current production. The original Russian suggestion was &quot; annual deliveries of commodities during ten years after the end of the war.&quot;At our suggestion this was amended to &quot; annual deliveries of goods from current production&quot;for a period to be fixed.&quot; It is not known what kind of goods theRussians had in mind, but we may presume that they did not intend to limit theirchoice.7. As stated in paragraph 3 above, the main purpose of the once-for-alldeliveries will be to destroy the war potential of Germany. Considerations ofeconomic security similarly demand that a desire to increase the volume of deliveries from current production should not be allowed to result in Germanybeing assisted to reconstruct her manufacturing industry after it has beenreduced by that surgical operation. We accordingly recommend that manu-factured goods should be excluded from deliveries from current production. Thereis a further reason for which this is of great importance. The sacrifices which wehave made during the war have left us with a burden of overseas debt which wecannot hope to extinguish without a great expansion of our export trade. our best hopes of achieving this expansion lie in the field of manufactured goods; andit is essential, therefore, that we should not, as a result of the reparations settle-ments, establish Germany as a competitor in our export markets and create avested interest in the claimant countries in favour of the development of Germanindustries which compete with ours. This is a consideration which may makeless appeal to the other countries represented on the Moscow Commission than thatof economic security. But the difficulties of our external position, and their cause,are well-known and there is no reason why our Delegation should not franklyadmit that they have weighed heavily with us in our consideration of this problem.8. We also recommend that current deliveries should exclude food and feeding-stuffs unless (which is most unlikely) a surplus of any of them is devolped in excess of Germany&apos;s approved requirements. It is most important thatGermany&apos;s resources of foodstuffs should be devoted first to meeting the needsof the occupying Forces and the approved requirements of the civilian population in Germany as a whole. Otherwise the food surplus in Eastern Germany willbe removed to Russia and the Western Powers will be obliged to provide foodstuffs to make good the deficiency in Western Europe.9. Coal presents a difficult and special problem. For the next year or two,North-West Europe is likely to be acutely short of coal. We shall have littlesurplus to export during that period, although, thereafter, it is to be hoped thatBritish coal will play its full part in our export drive. It is important, therefore,to endeavour to avoid any arrangement which would hinder the recovery of ourcoal export markets after that period. It follows that, from the point of viewof our export drive in later years, the ideal arrangement would be to excludecoal from reparations. We do not, however, think that this is a practical proposition. A number of countries, notably France, attach the greatest importance to securing reparation coal; and it will be difficult enough to secure their agreement even to the proposal made in paragraph 11 below, which will mean that they will have to pay for all coal which they obtain from germany during the first two years.10. In short our proposal is that reparation deliveries from German current production should be limited to a specified list of raw materials and semi-manufactured goods which would include coal, potash, timber, cement and bricks.
but would exclude food.   We might agree, if pressed, to add steel to the list,but should not propose it.11. We recommend that the start of the programme of current reparation deliveries should be delayed till after the end of the two-year period of once-for-all deliveries i.e., that all deliveries from current production during those two years should be paid for. This will happen in practice if we succeed (aswe propose in paragraph 24 below) in establishing the principle that a first charge on all German exports is reserved to pay for her approved imports, which during that period are unlikely to be less than her capacity to export. It seems best to admit this at once, and not to raise false hopes; we could agree that, in theunlikely event of her having accumulated a surplus at the end of this period,it should be divided up among the recipient nations. Further, during the first two years our primary objectives will be the programme of disarmament andeconomic security, the removal of goods (e.g., coal) needed for urgent supplyreasons, once-for-all-deliveries and reparation labour, and the repatriation fromGermany of prisoners of war and displaced persons, and to Germany of Germansabroad. These, taken together, will impose an immense burden on Germantransport. If recipient countries are simultaneously bidding for transport to fill up their quota of current deliveries, which will not in every case be the sameas the goods which ought to be moved for urgent supply reasons, the accomplish-ment of our primary objectives may be held up.12. We recommend that our delegation should accept the Soviet proposalfor a ten-year period for current deliveries, subject to a provision for recon-sideration after the end of five years. These periods would date from thebeginning of the programme i.e., current deliveries as reparations would endat latest twelve years after the surrender if, as we suggest, the start of theprogramme is deferred for two years.13. Labour. The principal claimant will be Russia. We know little ofwhat the Russians have in mind; they mentioned a figure of 4 million workers at the Teheran Conference, and it appears probable that they mean to take themfor a limited number of years, and not for life; but we do not know enough toform any sound conclusions. Others of our Allies will certainly want somereparation labour; we ourselves may want a substantial number for a time.14. We consider it most important that the impressment of reparationlabour should be completed within a short period and that thereafter no furtherlabour should be taken, even for replacements. There is little hope of settledconditions in Germany so long as the threat of deportation hangs over everyone&apos;shead, and the experience of occupied Europe shows that this threat is the strongest stimulus to a resistance movement.15. Though we ourselves will probably take such labour as we require only from among German prisoners of war existing at the time of surrender, we donot consider that this should be made the rule for all the claimant countries. Wedo not exclude the idea that the Russians should take labour from our zone; itwill probably suffer from heavy unemployment, and it may be to our advantage that they should do so. We do not think that we can stimulate that labour shouldbe chosen only, or primarily, from among active Nazis; but it might well beprovided that, other things being equal, they should be selected in preference to others.16. In view of the need to maximise coal production, it should be providedthat German miners, as a class should be reserved from impressment, except for employment in other coal-mines.17. The most difficult question in relation to reparation labour is whether any conditions on its employment should be laid down and internationally agreed in the reparation plan; in other words, should the labourers or the GermanGovernment on their behalf have any rights ? This is a different question fromthe decision, as a matter of domestic policy, on the conditions which we shall ofour own free will apply to German labour used here; this latter question is being-considered elsewhere, and we are not concerned with, it, except to see that ourown conditions fall within the provisions of any general agreement. As such anagreement would have to cover Russia as well as ourselves, there is little danger that our conditions will fall below any minima established.18. If any conditions on the employment of German labour are laid down,as a matter of international obligation,&quot; in tire reparation plan, it will not be
possible for us to secure their carrying out and this is a strong argument against our accepting any responsibility in the matter. On the other hand, reparationlabour will doubtless be taken from our zone, and we shall wish to insist that account should be taken of labour in the general settlement. These factors makeit hard for us to wash our hands of the conditions of employment.19. We recommend that our delegation should propose that all countriestaking reparation labour should sign a declaration in regard to the conditions under which the labour would be employed, laying down certain uniform minimum standards as to food, lodging, medical treatment, working pay, and also periodof service. On this last point we make no present recommendation, since we thinkit better first to hear what the Russians propose. If we secure such a declaration,it must be recognised that it cannot be policed; we must rest on each country&apos;sassurance that it is carrying out the conditions which it has accepted. It hasbeen suggested that some international body, on which labour would be repre-sented, should be given rights of supervision and inspection; but, although theidea was supported by the Russian delegation at the recent World Trade UnionCongress, we think it most unlikely that any effective policing would be acceptable to the Russian Government, and&apos; we do not think it worth while putting theproposal forward ourselves.20. A first step towards obtaining an agreed policy on this matter hasalready been taken by a proposal which the United Kingdom representative hasmade in the European Advisory Commission (E.A.C. (45) 15) that all Germanlabour employed outside Germany should be treated as prisoners of war. russia is not a party to the Geneva Convention, but they have already agreed (E.A.C. (44)7th Meeting) that German prisoners of war so declared under Article 2 (b) of the instrument of Surrender will be treated &quot; in accordance with the standards ofinternational law.&quot;III. Limitations on Reparation.21. Reparation will not be the only charge on Germany&apos;s assets and production, and its priority in relation to other charges will have to bedetermined. A number of questions will have to be considered under this head(e.g., the position of.our pre-war claims and the treatment of German assetsabroad), but we need only draw the attention of the War Cabinet to the one whichis most important to us as an occupying Power namely, that the full require-ments of the Allied forces of occupation and the essential minimum requirementsof the German population must be a first charge on German assets and on Germanproduction (whether production for home consumption or production for export to the extent necessary to pay for approved imports). No deliveries, therefore,must be treated as free reparation deliveries unless they have been released assuch by the Control Commission.22. Though, so far as possible, common standards should be agreed for thelevel of consumption of the civilian population of Germany, the last word on theapplication of these standards must rest in each zone with the Commander, whois responsible in that zone for seeing that the objectives of the occupation are carried out. Equally, the Commander must have full powers of decision as tothe requirements of his forces.   It should therefore be agreed^ (a) that no material should be taken as reparation from any zone duringthe occupation which the Commander of that zone requires for theuse of his forces; and(&amp;) that no reparation, whether once-for-all, current production or labour,should be taken from any zone if the Commander of that zone judgesthat it would be beyond the reparation capacity of the zone or would endanger the objectives of the occupation.Differences of view on such questions should, so far as possible, be resolved anda common policy reached on the Control Commission, of which all fourCommanders are members.23. Germany will require some imports; the application to them of theprinciple recommended in paragraph 21 above will be a good deal more difficult.The matter should not be taken zone by zone; this would be unfair to the western powers, since Western Germany is the chief deficiency area. We have always ,maintained, and must still maintain, that both as exporter and importer, and )for the purpose of the interchange of goods, Germany must be treated as a singlewhole.
24. It is, therefore, most important that our Delegation should secure acceptance of the principle that payment for any relief and other supplies fromabroad, which are sent into Germany with the approval of the occupying powers, should be a first charge on any deliveries which Germany as a whole maymake. The United States Government agree with this principle and have insertedit in a draft directive which is now being discussed by the European advisory commission (A.P.W. (45) 63). If Germany made free deliveries to such an extent that she had not enough left over to deliver in payment for these supplies,it would mean that in fact the supplying countries were paying Gerrnany&apos;sreparation for her. The principle which we wish to establish can be applied in more than one way. It would be possible so to restrict the types or amounts ofgoods which might be delivered as reparation as to leave Germany with enoughexportable goods, available for sale, and other external assets to cover the cost ofher imports. It will be advisable to go some way in this direction; but as itcannot be guaranteed to cover the whole cost, it should be established thatGermany&apos;s approved imports, so far as their cost cannot be met from Germany&apos;s foreign earnings and other available external assets, should be paid for by thenations who are receiving reparation deliveries, in proportion to the value of the deliveries they have received.25. While we should support to the full the general principle which theAmerican Government have put forward, we believe that it may in practice beimpossible to make the charge effective against deliveries of existing capital equipment, which by their nature are far removed from commercial exports forwhich countries are accustomed to pay. A fortiori, it is most unlikely to be applicable to labour reparation. But it is essential that it should be made effective against all deliveries from Germany&apos;s current production.26. The effect of the charge will be that the recipients of reparation will payin the first instance for Germany&apos;s imports, by way of a diminution of the freedeliveries which they would otherwise receive. We shall be bound to admit that only imports approved by the four occupying Powers, who will also be theprincipal recipients of reparation, can be paid for in this way. We ought there-fore to secure, through the machinery of the Control Commission, the greatest possible measure of agreement between the four Powers on the basis on whichimports are to be authorised, in order to avoid the position where one of theother Powers refused to approve imports which we, on the advice of oUrCommander, considered it necessary to provide for our zone.27. Hitherto, during the period of active operations, the measure ofpermitted imports for the use of the population of occupied enemy territory hasbeen the need to avoid disease and unrest. For the purpose of Germany after &apos;the surrender, we suggest that imports should be permitted (and German produceretained for German use the same criterion applies to both) to an amountsufficient, but not more than sufficient, to give effect to the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement that &quot; it is not the purpose of the Allies to leave the people of germany without the necessary means of subsistence &quot; and to ensure that Germany&apos;sproductive efficiency shall be adequate to enable her to furnish such reparation asmay be required of her and to support herself on the minimum basis; provided,of course, that the application of this criterion does not result in Germany&apos;s basicliving standards being on a higher level than those generally current foe comparable categories of the population in liberated territories.IV. Amount of Reparation.28. At the Crimean Conference the Russians proposed, as a basis, ofdiscussion, a figure of $20 billions for the total of reparation deliveries, excludingreparation labour. The basis of valuation intended was 1938 prices, plus 10 percent, in the case of raw materials and 15 per cent, in the case of manufacturedgoods. The Russians, in the course of discussion, explained that they intendedthis figure to be made up of $10 billions of once-for-all deliveries and $10 billionsof current deliveries. They arrived at the former figure, as a measure ofGermany&apos;s capacity to make once-for-all deliveries, by a series of very arbitrarycalculations, starting from an estimate of Germany&apos;s pre-war wealth. TheRussian figure of $20 billions is, in our view, far too high an estimate. TheAmerican delegation - at the Crimean Conference accepted it as a basis ofdiscussion. The British delegation refused to commit themselves to any figure atthat stage.
29. A strong case can be made out against fixing any figure now as atotal of Germany&apos;s reparation deliveries. We have no adequate idea ofGermany&apos;s capacity, nor shall we have till we have been in control of the german economy for some time; nor have decisions been taken on many of the questionswhich will profoundly affect Germany&apos;s ability to make reparation : the cession of German territory, the transfer into Germany - of Germans from outside,dismemberment, the measure necessary for security, and the kind of economic life and general set-up for Germany at which we shall aim during the period ofoccupation. A rational plan would consist of principles, on the lines of those set out above, within which the amount of reparation should be made as large aspossible. Any figure fixed now must be an arbitrary one; yet Ministers will haveto defend it as reasonable before British and American opinion.30. If a figure is fixed now, it will almost certainly be either too high or too low. The disadvantages of a low figure are obvious. If it is too high, we shallbe in the invidious position of either having to cancel instructions which we havegiven to the Germans, by lowering the figure, or to abandon some of the limitingprinciples to which, in our own interest, we attach the highest importance. Inthe former case the Russians, who have proposed the figure, and are most likelyto insist on their pound of flesh may well demand concessions in other fields, notonly from the Germans, but also from us, since in defending our principles suchas the first charge in favour of approved imports we shall appear in theunpleasant position of defending the German case.31. A further argument against fixing a global figure in advance is thedifficulty of finding, without great dispute, a fair common basis of valuation interms of money for labour, once-for-all deliveries and current production. Werevert to this question in paragraphs 37-39.32. On the other hand, there are strong arguments against a flat refusal toagree to a global figure of reparation deliveries : (a) The Russians are believed to attach great importance to fixing a figure which will satisfy their public opinion. They are likely to regard this question (on which we have already differed from them in the caseof the satellite countries) as a test of our attitude un the wholequestion of the treatment of Germany. If we insist to the end, it may prove to be a breaking-point.(5) On the other hand, they may well be willing to reduce their figure to something more within the range of j)ractical politics. Marshal Stalin,at Yalta, said that he did not consider his figure as sacrosanct, and inthe negotiations on the Finnish and Hungarian armistice they reduced their demands, at our suggestion, with curiously little difficulty.(c) Our argument is not that the fixing of a firm figure is a bad thing in itself;if it could be done, it would be an excellent thing to do. But we claim that no rational figure can be fixed at this stage.33. We suggest that as a matter of tactics the best course for our delegation to take would be to say at once that we agree in principle that a global&apos; figure should be fixed as soon as there is a satisfactory basis for doing so, and then toexplain the reasons which made us feel it impossible to say at the outset of the negotiation what figure should be fixed or when it should be fixed. They should avoid a decision on this point until the other aspects of reparation had been fully discussed, and should attempt to convince the Russians, by practical argumentand by putting forward a concrete scheme for the allocation of deliveries withoutusing a global figure, that the fixing of a figure should be delayed at least till theperiod of once-for-all deliveries which is the period of greatest uncertainty ispast.V. Allocation of Reparation.34. The Yalta Protocol lays down that &quot; reparations are to be received in the first instance by those countries which have borne the main burden ofthe war, have suffered the heaviest losses and have organised victory over theenemy.&quot; It can readily be admitted that, taking the three criteria as a whole,the Russians deserve, as they have claimed, the largest share. We and theUnited States can claim an equal share under the first and third heads, andwe can claim far more than the United States under the second.   The other
Allies, under all three heads, will come far below Russia and ourselves. Weshould, however, without abating our claim or exaggerating theirs, regard it as our business at Moscow to secure a fair share at least to the Western european allies not represented on the Commission, and to the Dominions, should the latterwish to claim reparation; for, while they have suffered little war damage, theymust be regarded as potential claimants, having regard to the other criteria laiddown at Yalta.35. The quotas of reparation will have to be settled on broad and common-sense lines; but our delegation, while avoiding a nice mathematical calculation of the percentage, should go armed with all necessary statistical data to supportour claims. It is scarcely practicable to determine finally what our percentageshould be before we know the nature of the claims put forward by the othercountries, and the evidence by which they are supported; we will make more detailed recommendations on this point as soon as we have had before us the statistical data, which we are causing to be marshalled urgently, so far as theyare available.. 36. The Russians have claimed 50 per cent, of all reparation deliveries,once-for-all and current, with labour left out of the account. The Americansagreed to this claim; the British reserved their attitude at the Conference.37. Whatever percentage is decided for Russia by the Moscow Corn-mission, the delegation should not agree to it unconditionally. The four Powerswho will be represented at Moscow should agree among themselves thepercentages which they will advocate for the various claimants, but nopercentage should be finally fixed except as part of a general agreement between all the claimant countries.38. Labour is so important a part of reparation that it must not be leftout of the picture. If, as has been said, the Russians proposed to take 4 millionGermans as reparation labour, and if one takes the figure of  40 per annumwhich was tentatively suggested by the Interdepartmental Committee onReparation and Economic Security as the value of a German reparation worker,the total value over ten years &quot;of the Germans working for the Russians wouldbe $6-4 billion, or two-thirds of their claim for physical deliveries. Had theRussians put forward their claim in terms of a percentage including labour,on the basis of the tentative figures quoted above they would have asked not for50 per cent, but for 62 per cent.39. Therefore, in judging the total Russian claim (which has not yet beenput forward, since they have not yet stated how much reparation labour they want), full weight must be given to labour. The simplest way of doing this,ftrima facie, is to put a value on labour and to include it in the percentageallocation. But the process of. valuation is likely to be a contentious one, sincevalues vary from country to country, and are difficult to establish : the interestof those taking most labour is to value it low, and vice versa. Further, a low-price (which it will be impossible to conceal) will tend even if illogically tomake workers in the receiving country regard the arrangement as an attempt toreduce national wage levels. Provided that full weight is given to the labour to be received in determining the percentages of physical deliveries, it will, in ourview, be better to abandon any attempt to bring labour into the valued deliveries.40. There is no need for each class of reparation delivery to be dividedamong the claimant countries in exact proportion to their general quota, though this formula may be a useful guide in cases where the demand exceeds the supply.But, in general, such a rule would be inefficient; different countries have differentneeds, and within the total allotted to each country the kinds of deliveries to betaken could be settled by the Inter-Allied Reparation Commission referred to inparagraph 48 below, which would allot the available supplies in accordance withthe wishes of the claimant countries. In the case of some commodities specialrules of allocation may be devised : in particular, it would be to our advantage that ships should be divided up amongst the claimants in proportion to shipping-losses, and not in the general reparation proportions. Our delegation should press for this and can concede the same treatment for rolling-stock, and for livestockin so far as any is available consistently with the principle laid down in para-graph 8 above; this claim is likely to be made by the European allies, who have lost both rolling-stock and livestock heavily as the result of German depreciations.[29910] d
VI.-Austria.41. We do not consider that there is any reason of principle why Austriashould not pay reparation. This question has been raised by the Russians on theEuropean Advisory Commission. Our representative, while admitting theprinciple, has taken the line that the question whether she can afford to pay any, and what form it should take, must be further considered, having regardto her need for essential imports and to the expressed intention of the four Powersto establish her as an independent State. We suggest that this line should bemaintained. Austria cannot exist without imports; and, if she is made topay any substantial reparation, we may find that we and the Americans arepaying reparation for her. It is, therefore, particularly important that the first charge in favour of the cost of imports should be established in the case of Austria,and that no commitments should be undertaken to extract large amounts of repara-tion from her, which will never be achieved. All the arguments against fixing a figure for propaganda purposes apply a fortiori to Austria.42. This is not to say that Austria can contribute no reparation at all. SomeAustrian plant will have to be scrapped or removed on grounds of economicsecurity; some labour-particularly if it is possible to segregate Nazis for thispurpose might be furnished; these might be suitable subjects of reparation if,as we believe, the charge in favour of imports cannot be made effective againstonce-for-all deliveries and reparation labour.VII. Restitution.43. The Armistice and Post-War Committee of the War Cabinet agreed(A.P.W. (44) 21st meeting, items 2 and 3) that restitution i.e., restoration in totooutside the reparation settlement should be confined to the restoration of idemtifiable property (including monetary gold and durable valuables) which existedprior to enemy occupation of the country concerned, in so far as it can be recovered and irrespective of the form of dispossession by which it has come intoenemy hands. Except as regards works of art, they have rejected the thesis,which is strongly upheld by the French and the minor European Allies, thatassets looted by the Germans which cannot be traced and identified should bereplaced out of existing German assets in priority to reparation. They con-sidered that these and all other claims, except for the restitution of identifiableobjects and the replacement, on certain conditions, of works of art, should be covered by the general reparation settlement. Proposals in this sense have beenput to the European Advisory Commission by the United Kingdom representative.44. We endorse the conclusions of the Armistice and Post-War Committee,except in one respect which we suggest should be reconsidered. It does not seemto us that monetary gold, even when clearly identifiable as having been lootedfrom the Allies, is a proper subject of restitution. It is pure chance if apar-ticular bar of gold happens to be identifiable; one bar of gold is as good as another. Nor do we see any reason why losses of gold looted by Germany fromthe Allies deserve any better treatment than our losses of gold expended forthe winning of the war. We therefore recommend that, as an exception to thegeneral principle of restitution quoted above, all gold found in Germany, whetheror not it is identified as having been looted from our Allies, should be divided upamong the countries entitled to reparation in the normal reparation percentages.45. There is one case which may need special treatment. The Germanstook over certain gold from the Vichy Government, which the Belgians hadentrusted to the Banque de^France for safe keeping. The French Governmenthave now handed over to Belgium an equivalent amount of gold, and seek to recover from Germany the gold which was taken. Following on the decision ofthe Armistice and Post-War Committee, the French Government have been told that His Tviajesty&apos;s Government will support this claim, in so far as the gold canbe found and identified. We are therefore pledged so far; but this claim, arisingfrom the settlement of an obligation of honour, can be treated as a special case.46. We also recommend that Austria, Italy and the satellites should receiverestitution of identifiable assets to the same extent as the Allies, provided thatassets so recovered are dealt with in accordance with any reparation, conditions imposed on those countries.
r f?VIII. Machinery for executing the Reparation Plan.47. The Moscow Commission will lay down a general plan; but some formof semi-permanent machinery will be needed to carry it into effect. The russians are likely to propose that this should all be done by the Control Commission inGermany. The Control Commission will have essential functions to perform inConnection with reparation; it is they who must see what goods are available for delivery, and arrange for their procurement and delivery to the German frontier.But there are other tasks for which they are less suited. The deliveries must be allocated between the different claimants, matters in dispute between them mustbe settled, and the plan must be interpreted. It is not suitable to ask a body com-posed of four Commanders-in-chief to settle questions arising between alliedgovernments other than their own. Such questions ought to be decided by a body on which all the recipients of reparation are represented.48. We therefore recommend the establishment of an Inter-Allied Repara-tion Commission to deal with these questions and to administer the general policyof the plan, subject to the rights of veto reserved to the zone commanders inaccordance with paragraph 22 above and to the executive functions of the control commission. All the countries entitled to receive reparation should be repre-sented on it; but it would be necessary to ensure that the minor powers could not use their representation on it to upset the reparation policy, or the German policyin general, of the four controlling Powers. This could best be done by givingplural votes to the four Powers. It should, if possible, sit in Germany, side by side with the Control Commission, with which it will have to be in constantcontact.ANNEX III.Text of the Protocol signed at the Crimean Conference.Conversations between the Heads of the Three Governments at the Crimea conference on the Question of Reparation in Kind from Germany.The Heads of the three Governments have agreed as follows : 1. Germany must pay in kind for the losses caused by her to the allied nations in the course of the war. Reparations are to be received in the firstinstance by those countries which have borne the main burden of the war, have suffered the heaviest losses and have organised victory over the enemy.2. Reparation in kind is to be exacted from Germany in three followingforms :  (a) Removals within two years from the surrender of Germany or the cessation of organised resistance from the national wealth of Germanylocated on the territory of Germany herself as well as outside her territory (equipment, machine-tools, ships, rolling-stock, Germaninvestments abroad, shares of industrial, transport and other enter-prises in Germany, &amp;o), these removals to be carried out chiefly forpurposes of destroying the war potential of Germany.(b) Annual deliveries of goods from current production for a period to befixed.(c) Use of German labour.3. For the working out on the above principles of a detailed plan forexaction of reparation from Germany an Allied Reparation Commission will beset up in Moscow. It will consist of three representatives one from trie Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics, one from the United Kingdom and one from theUnited States.
4. With regard to the fixing of the total sum of the reparation as wellas the distribution of it among the countries which suffered from the german aggression the Soviet and American delegations agreed as follows :- &quot; The Moscow Reparation Commission should take in its initial studiesas a basis for discussion the suggestion of the Soviet Government that thetotal sum of the reparation in accordance with the points (a) and (b) of the paragraph 2 should be 20 billion dollars and that 50 per cent, of it should go to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.&quot;The British delegation was of the opinion that pending consideration ofthe reparation question by the Moscow Reparation Commission no figures of reparation should be mentioned.The above Soviet-American proposal has been passed to the Moscow Repara-tion Commission as one of the proposals to be considered by the Commission.
