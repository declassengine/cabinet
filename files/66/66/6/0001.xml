Printed for the Cabinet. - May 1945.O 96  SECEET.CP. (43) 6.31s  May, 1945.CABINET.GENERAL ELECTION.Memorandum by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.IN view of the abnormal conditions under which the forthcoming GeneralElection will be held, I consider that it is necessary to make certain changes inthe rules governing the wearing of uniform hj candidates and the participation in political activities by members of the Armed Forces of the Crown.2.   The arrangements should be as follows : (a) Up to the date of the Dissolution and after the Election is over, therules now in force will apply. The changes therefore will only operatebetween the date of the Dissolution and Polling Day.(b) The wearing of uniform  by candidates. All bona fide candidates,whether former Members of Parliament or not, of all Parties and of all three Services, will be entitled to wear uniform and to take part freelyin politics whether in their own constituencies or elsewhere.(c) Participation in -political activities by officers and men who are regularmembers of the Armed Forces. j\o change should be made here, theposition being that they will be free to attend meetings in the UnitedKingdom, but cannot play an active part or go on the platformwhether in uniform or plain clothes.Copy No.        2 3[299881[p.t.o.
2(d) Temporary members of the Armed Forces.-They will be free to attend meetings in the United Kingdom, but if they wish to take any active part such as going on the platform or speaking or intervening in theproceedings, they must wear plain clothes.(e) The above applies of course to all Services and to members of all Parties.3. I understand that submissions to The King may be required to give effectto the necessary departures from the Dress Regulations.&apos; These should be madeas soon as possible. When approved I would, propose to have a Question asked inthe House which will enable me to give details of the new arrangements.w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S. W. 1,31st May, 1945.
