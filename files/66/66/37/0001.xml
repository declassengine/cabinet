Mr exMote by the ^ttomey-Grcnerai1. I do not think that any difficulty would arise under the Electoral Law if travel facilities by Serviceaircraft or otherwise were provided free to ministers for journeys connected with the election.      In my opinion,no payment or expense would be involved within themeaning of the Corrupt Practices Act,  1383.2. I understand that under existing arrangementsofficial cars can be used by Ministers for their privatepurposes at their own expense.      In these circumstances,if a Minister used his official car for election purposes,he would have to pay for its use.      If that use were inhis own constituency, payment for it would constitute a personal expense and would have to bo treated as such inregard to election expenses.      If the use were in anotherconstituency than his own,  the payment would not,   in myopinion,  be an item in election expenses.Similarly, if it were decided to make a charge- forthe use by a Minister of a Service aircraft for electionpurposes in his own constituency the amount paid by himwould have to be included in his election expenses.3. With regard to the Prime minister&apos;s private railwaycoach,  I see nc difficulty under the Electoral Law inrespect of the user of this facility outside  the PrimeMinister&apos;s own constituency.      In the unlikely event ofits user in his  own constituency,   it would be a personalexpense and would have to be taken into account as such.h. While- the foregoing paragraphs set out the position under the Electoral Law,  the Cabinet will also wish toconsider whether in general it would be proper for aGovernment Department to permit Ministers the use ofGovernment aircraft for electioneering purposes.      In my view,   if it is clear that the true purpose is to enablethe Minister to carry out his ministerial duties,   therewould be no objection.      If,  on tie other hand,  the purpose is merely electioneering,  the point will no. doubt beraised,  first on the platform and ultimately in Parliament,whether the permission of such user is within the powersof the Government and a proper use of Government authority.On this point I have grave doubt.
