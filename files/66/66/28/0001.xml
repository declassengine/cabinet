THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted, for the Cabinet.   June 1945.SECRET. / Copy No.CP. (45) 28.11th June, 1945.CABINET,SUPPLIES OF MEAT TO ALLIED COUNTRIES IN NORTH-west europe.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and Minister ofProduction and the Minister of State.WE are seriously concerned at the situation that has arisen over suppliesof meat to Allied countries in North-West Europe. The present intention isthat no meat whatever should be allocated to France, Belgium or Holland throughthe Combined Food Board or S.H.A.E.F. during the second and third quarters of 1945, while the outlook for the fourth quarter is quite uncertain. This yeardomestic production in those countries is so low in relation to needs that it is not practicable to ensure the equitable distribution of even a small ration without additional supplies from overseas.2. The French and Belgian Governments are reiterating by every means at their disposal and with growing insistence their acute anxiety over meat, andthe Netherlands Government can be expected to take similar action when theyhave taken stock of their position. The French and Belgians maintain that theycannot satisfy their public opinion so long as the Combined Food Board refuseto make any allocations and S.H.A.E.F. fail to make supplies available. Itseems likely that unless the position improves there may be serious internaldisturbances in France and Belgium, resulting in the replacement of the existingGovernments there by a more extremist and intransigent regime. Such a develop-ment would have a disastrous effect on our own position in North-West Europe.Even if no change of regime or actual disturbance takes place the continuance ofthe present position as regards meat supplies is bound seriously to strain our political relations with the Western Allies.3. The Belgian Government in the attached memorandum (Annex 1) left with the Foreign Secretary recently by the Belgian Ambassador, point out that theprinciple of the general pooling of supplies has come to mean that when there isnot enough to go round the United States, the United Kingdom and Canadashare what is available and other members of the pool get nothing a criticism which we find it difficult to contest in regard to meat. The French Governmenthave taken a similar line and have made it clear to us that, in view of theirown public opinion, they cannot much longer refrain from entering the Argentinemarket on their own account unless they obtain better treatment through the combined Supply Machinery. In this connexion we would draw our colleagues&apos;attention to Washington telegram No. 3590 COMPLY of the 24th May (Annex II)and to Paris telegrams Nos. 780 of the 27th May (Annex III) and 796 of30th May (Annex IV).4. Efforts are being made to help the position. The Allied governments are to be represented on the Meat Committee of the Combined Food Board,and a conference of the Allied Ministers of Food and Agriculture is being-arranged. But these are no more than palliatives. What the Allies want isa place in the world&apos;s meat supply and the result of their closer participation in the work of the Combined Food Board can only be to confirm their belief that they are not getting this now. Indeed, in addition to the political dangersmentioned above, it seems to us that unless something can be done to give our allies satisfaction there is a serious risk of a break-down of the Combined SupplyMachinery.   If, however, we can do something to help the Allied Governments,12818   [30044] n
then we shall be in a much stronger position to insist that they observe the rulingsof the Combined Boards and that they take energetic steps to rectify the short-comings in their own administrative machinery.5. In our opinion the consequences of failing to act now are so grave thatwe should not defer our decision until the fourth quarter but should make available at once from United Kingdom resources a contribution towards the meat require-ments of the European Allies, provided this can be done without further reduc-tions in the United Kingdom meat ration. This would place us in a position toput strong pressure on the United States and Canadian Governments to take similar action.0. L.Foreign Of/ice, W. M.11th June, 1945.(Translation.)ANNEX I.Memorandum from the Belgian Ambassador.The Belgian Meat Supply Problem.THE question of Belgium&apos;s meat supply is causing the Belgian Governmentgrave anxiety. An allocation of meat has been asked for from the combined food Board, but has been refused because imports continue to be a militaryresponsibility until the 1st September, 1945.In order to attain the ration of 2,000 calories, the military authoritiesfixed their monthly imports of meat and meat substitutes at 15,792 tons, ofwhich 10,185 tons must be meat properly speaking. However, actual importshave been considerably lower than this. During the first quarter of 1945,instead of reaching the planned figure of 47,376 tons, imports amounted only to29,965 tons, of which 9,756 tons consisted of meat (see Annex A).The situation will become still worse in the future. In the course of Aprilthere were no imports of meat and the military authorities have informed theBelgian Government that arrivals cannot be expected in the course of futuremonths. The Belgian Government thus finds itself in an impossible situation :the Combined Food Board on the one hand decides that the import of meat isa military responsibility and refuses to make any allocation for the Belgiannational programme, while the military authorities on the other hand statethat they are unable to provide the quantity anticipated.In the present diet of the Belgian population, meat and meat substitutesof animal origin amount to the equivalent of 226 calories and 17 grammes of animal protein per head per day. This estimate, however, must be regardedas the maximum, for unrationed foods are not always regularly distributed.The quantity of protein, broadly speaking, only meets in any case 45 per cent, ofthe normal needs of the population.In the circumstances, if imports of meat and similar products ceased, thequantity of animal protein included in the Belgian alimentary regime would fall to 11 grammes per head per day, that is to say, to 30 per cent, of normal requirements (see Annex B). Faced with this problem, the Belgian Governmentasked the Combined Food Board for a meat allocation. A definite refusal togrant such an allocation to Belgium would have extremely serious consequences,since short of the resumption of regular imports, the partial solutions which havebeen proposed would only slightly improve the position ;(1) The Belgian Government is well aware that in view of the presentsituation all parties must be asked to make sacrifices, but it would be impossibleto make the Belgian people understand why Belgium should not receive anymeat at all. Although the Belgian- Government have not renewed the agreementof 1941 and could consequently avail themselves of their right to dispose freelyof supplies from the Congo in favour of Belgium, they have up till now strictlyadhered to the principle of &quot; pooling &quot; and have accepted an equitable distribu-tion amongst the Allies of their African resources (notably in the case ofvegetable oils, which have been put into the pool although Belgium is short of oils and fats).Can Belgium be expected to continue to accept this policy of sharing her own resources with others if she does not receive a reasonable share of meat fromthe pool ?   May it not also be recalled that the meat contracts placed in Argentina
have been negotiated and concluded by Great Britain on behalf of the united nations.Some compensation for the lack of calories resulting from the cessation of meat imports could be obtained by reserving solely for Belgium the whole ofthe Congo production of vegetable oils. This solution, which would scarcely be satisfactory from the general point of view, would allow the maintenance ofthe Belgian diet at its present level in terms of calories but would not providethe population with the animal protein which is so urgently needed.(2) No immediate increase of Belgian meat production is possible. TheBelgian cattle are under-nourished and in very bad condition. The yield of meat per head represents only half the pre-war yield. Excessive slaughteringsand enemy requisitioning have heavily reduced the amount of livestock duringthe war years. Additional losses were incurred during RundstedCs offensivelast winter in the Ardennes, which affected one of the principal livestock regions of the country.Restocking must, in the nature of things, be slow. Immediate efforts arebeing made in order to increase the production of pork. This policy necessitatesthe import of fodder for the livestock. The Four-Party Supply Committee gaveits&apos; approval to the import of 60,000 tons of fodder in addition to the civilprogramme already approved. The necessary allocation must now be made bythe Combined Food Board and the necessary means of transport obtained.However, the effect of any increase in the production of pork will only be felt in six months&apos; time.(3) The greater part of the Belgian fishing fleet is still under the controlof the British Admiralty or engaged in fishing for British account. Thereturn to Belgium of four large trawlers and fifty fishing boats of average sizewould be a first step towards the restoration of Belgian coastal fishing andwould improve the Belgian fish supply. The grant of an allocation of salt fishfrom Iceland would be welcome. In that case, one or two ships would have tobe put on the regular run between Iceland and Belgium.Such steps would lessen the difficulties, but would not remove the necessity%)i importing meat.(4) As indicated above, the critical situation in Belgium as regards meatis largely the result of German requisitioning. It is therefore necessary to takefrom Germany a corresponding amount of cattle and meat. A request in this sense has been put before the Four-Party Supply Committee, but to the best ofour knowledge no decision has been taken.The obvious conclusion from this survey is that it is necessary for belgium to be granted a reasonable allocation of meat by the Combined Food Board.Now that hostilities have come to an end, the Belgian Government considerit desirable that they should have representatives on every organisation whosetask it is to allocate food supplies. .London, 22nd May, 1945.Annex A.Military Imports of Meat and Substitutes into Belgium.To be imported according to programme :  1945.(In tons.)

(Received 2^th May.)Washington, 23rd May, 1945.(No. 3590.)(Telegraphic.)MEAT for France.On instructions from Monnet, the French recently discussed with members ofmy staff their difficulties over meat. They reminded us that they had waited foran allocation of meat since January. They had followed with interest thediscussions which Captain Lyttelton and Colonel Llewellin had had with the americans and were grateful for the statement which the Minister of production had made to them at the end of these negotiations. They pointed out, however,that some time had passed since then and a definite meat allocation seemed nonearer. The United States Government had told them that no meat would beavailable for export from the United States till well on into the fourth quarter.The Canadian Government representatives had told them that virtually no meatwould be available for export from Canada before the fourth quarter. (We under-stand, however, that discussions are now proceeding with Canadian authoritiesregarding United Kingdom military requirements as the result of which somequantities, though these will only be small, may be released by Canadian Govern-ment before the fourth quarter.) They had tried to find out from the food mission what were the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government but had not received
8\ &amp;S3a definite reply and, though they gathered that no meat was likely to be availablefor France from United Kingdom stocks, the question of supplies from theArgentine remained in the air. They then enquired whether the embassy could give them further enlightenment and were told that we had nothing to add to.what they knew already.2. This did not appear to surprise them and they went on to say that inthese circumstances they considered they must now lay the whole position beforethe French Provisional Government. They would say they were convinced forthe next five months no imported meat would be available to France from United- States or Canada and that they understood it would be difficult to draw on united Kingdom stocks but that there was a flow of meat to United kingdom from the Argentine. Accordingly they would recommend two courses as beingopen to their Government. Either the French Government could seek to purchasesuch exportable [ ? group omitted] in the Argentine as might be available outsidethe terms of the United Kingdom contract or the French Government could firstask His Majesty&apos;s Government to allow France to participate in the Argentinecontract, the United Kingdom releasing meat to French from United Kingdornstocks for subsequent replacement out of French participation in the contract.Of the two courses, French representatives remarked, the latter was greatly tobe preferred since to enter into open competition with United Kingdom in SouthAmerica would merely force prices up and make all meat more difficult topurchase. The situation in France was so serious, however, that if no arrange-ment could be come to quickly with United Kingdom they felt that the FrenchGovernment would be forced to take whatever measures were open to relieve theposition even if such measures were objectionable to the rest of us.3. So far as the French are concerned there is nothing new in the foregoingexcept that lapse of time has made the position in France more difficult and theFrench here consequently more insistent. What is new, however, is thatAmericans and Canadians have now told the French that over the next fewmonths they will get nothing from either of them. The French feel they have not had a clear answer from us about Argentine, and this has exposed UnitedKingdom members of the Food Board to the full force of French criticism.4. We are convinced the worst thing we can do is to continue to say nothing to the French. If we are to say something soon there appears to be two alternatives : We could say they could have no meat at all either from UnitedKingdom stocks or from the Argentine. Such a statement would at least havethe virtue of putting the United Kingdom member of the Combined Food board in line with his United States and Canadian colleagues. On the other hand,quite apart from any considerations regarding our own relations with the French,we would, by a statement of this kind, risk giving Americans whatever excusethey can contrive in the light of recent inter-governmental food discussions to keep their exports of meat in the fourth quarter of this year to a minimum. It is,of course, clearly in our interest to do everything we can by direct or indirectmeans to secure maximum possible export of meat from United States in thelatter part of this year. ,5. It seems therefore essential to consider what statement His Majesty&apos;sGovernment can make to the French other than a complete negative. We havethe strong impression the French now mean business. Since we imagine that theeffect of their eruption into the South American market would be unfortunate,there would seem to be much to be said for giving serious consideration to theproposal which it would seem likely the French Government will now make that either by release from United Kingdom stocks against later replacement orby means of a share in current shipment from the Argentine, the French shouldreceive some meat supplies in the next few months.6. To sum up it seems very necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government togive some answer quickly to the French. A blank refusal would at least put uson a par with other members of the Food Board, but a firm offer promptly madefor some small participation in South American supplies or some quantity from united States stocks over the next few months would go a very long way to meetthe position. Hitherto the French have been prepared to await developments,but they now know how they stand with the United States and Canada anddoubt whether the United Kingdom will be any more ruthless. Therefore they feelthey must take action themselves in the only place they can, South America. Itis the prospect of no imported supplies they feel they cannot tolerate. They haveno illusions about the scarcity of meat supplies, and they know whatever smallquantity can be made available will have to be shared amongst a number of liberated areas.
ANNEX III.Mr. Holman to Foreign Office. [Received 27th May.)(No. 780.)(Telegraphic.) Paris, 27th May, 1945.FROM conversations we have had with M. Alphand since his return fromthe United States and with other senior officials of the French administrationit is clear that we are heading for a show-down with the French &quot;on supplymatters, particularly food. The French line is that they fully recognise the needfor co-ordinated action and have demonstrated this by their loyal asquiescencehitherto in working through the combined boards and refraining from indepen-dent purchasing. Nevertheless results have been extremely disappointing. even when the French have received allocations either they have not received the neces-sary shipping assistance to implement them or there have been difficulties overprocurement which have stultified allocation. In other cases allocations ofsupplies have been inadequate and in the particular case of meat nil.2. In support of their case the French state that food items in their civilimport programme were calculated to raise last year&apos;s ration to the modest figureof 1,650 calories but that only a very small proportion (according to M. Millardetsome 10 per cent.) had arrived by 1st May. This, of course, takes no account ofcivil affairs programme and the French figure is open to some question. Never-theless it is not far from the mark, and performance has been, to say the least of it, disappointing.3. In these circumstances and having regard to the grave position in france the French feel that a new deal is called for. They are likely to press their claim for membership of combined board and to insist that allocation of combined boards should be based upon some equitable standard of consumption as between themselves, United States and United Kingdom. I do not think they will press for parity but they will certainly ask that allocations shall permit a certain reason-able minimum standard of consumption for France even if this involves reduc-tion of higher standards of consumption in the United States and UnitedKingdom.4. They are also likely to attack the present system of co-ordinated buyingarrangements and to insist that they should negotiate direct for supplies allo-cated to them-from other countries.5. Another disturbing feature of our discussions has been the constantreference to allegedly more favourable treatment accorded to Belgium. TheFrench contend that for the month of May 32 ships have been allocated to Belgiumwith a population of 8,000,000 and that allocation to France and North Africa,with a total population of 60 million, is 35. We have, of course, used the obviousargument of the greater dependence of Belgium on imported supplies, but the disparity on the figures alleged by French is difficult to explain. The discrepancyis emphasised by the substantial higher ration scale prevailing in Belgium ascompared with France.6. State of alarm which is apparent in official circles here has beenaccentuated by the estimates which have now been made of the enormous cerealrequirements of French North Africa on which I am telegraphing separately.The French estimate that for cereals alone shipping requirements of France andFrench North Africa combined will amount to 50 ships a month and that it is imperative that there be no delay in commencing shipments at this rate. If this figure is compared with the present allocation of 35 ships to cover the whole import requirements of France the magnitude of the problem is self-evident and it seemsto us quite clear it cannot be handled through existing administration channelsbut that decisions at highest level will have to be taken.7. I fear the economic situation is rapidly deteriorating here and that unlessgreat efforts are made there will be serious trouble.(Repeated to Washington.)
ANNEX IV.Mr. Holman to Foreign Office. (Received 30th May.)(No. 796.)(Telegraphic.) Paris, 30th May, 1945.WASHINGTON telegram No. 3590.I feel that by way of comment I need add very little to my telegram No. 780which in particular supports Washington&apos;s impression that the French meanbusiness.2. I entirely agree that the worst thing we can do is to say nothing. TheFrench constantly complain that although their request for a meat allocation was presented many months ago they have had absolutely no reply. This makes their position intolerable.3. If the French are to get some meat later in the year I think it would bedesirable, if at all possible, to offer them some small advance on account. It wouldthen be up to them to decide whether to accept the advance (bearing in mind thatresumption of imports might increase the commercialisation of France&apos;sindigenous resources) or to conserve their allocation intact for the difficult months later in the year.(Repeated to Washington.)
