THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1945.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 34.13th June, 1945.v cabinet.THE FUTURE OF THE FIRE SERVICE.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.MANY local authorities and others concerned are likely to press for an earlypronouncement on the future of the National Fire Service often, probably, inthe form of asking whether the Government intend to honour my predecessor&apos;spledge that after the war the fire fighting forces should again be a local authorityservice.2. My predecessor was given authority on the 4th October last to undertake(with the Secretary of State for Scotland) exploratory conversations on the futureof the Fire Service with the associations of local authorities &quot; on the basis of ascertaining the general trend of their views rather than of seeking to secure their assent to a particular line of policy, and that the War Cabinet had reachedno decision in the matter.&quot;3. Those discussions showed that a very large majority of local authoritieswanted a return to local control, though they were willing to discuss improvements in the organisation established under the Fire Brigades Act of 1938. They also had clearly in mind the desirability (from their point of view) of an exchequer grant.4. I think myself that apart from the pledge given in 1941, the Fire Servicemay well be regarded as appropriate for local authority control; but it is desirablethat the local layout should take into account the lessons we have learned in warabout fire fighting and fire organisation, and should show a reduction in thenumber of units and an improvement in co-operative organisation.5. I do not ask for any detailed decision; but I ask that the Cabinet should authorise an announcement that the Government believe that in principle the fire Service should again become a local authority responsibility. The future organisation will be discussed further with representatives of local authorities,taking into account what has been learned during the last five years about themost efficient and economical methods of fire fighting and organisation.6.   The Secretary of State for Scotland concurs.D. B. S.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W. 113th June, 1945.[30060]
