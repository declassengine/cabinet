Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 32.11th June, 1945.CABINET.NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE.Memorandum by the Minister of Health and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.1. The draft White Paper on progress with the National Health Serviceproposals, circulated by the Lord President on the 4th June, 1945 (CP. (45) 13),was considered on the 6th June by a meeting of Ministers under the chairmanship of the Lord President and attended by the Lord Privy Seal, the Minister ofHealth, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Aircraft Productionand the Minister of National Insurance.2. This meeting of Ministers agreed that the balance of advantage layagainst publishing the draft White Paper before the dissolution. They also agreed that the Health Ministers should submit to the Cabinet at an early dated memorandum outlining the main points on which they wished to modify theoriginal White Paper proposals, and should seek authority to announce these changes in general terms before the Election.3. The memorandum appended indicates the main changes from the originalWhite Paper of 1944 which would be involved if the new proposals set out in thedraft White Paper&apos; recently circulated were adopted.4. It is believed that the new scheme will be largely agreed and that it will,in general, be supported by the great majority of the doctors, by the voluntary hospitals and by the Associations of local authorities, but not by the LondonCounty Council.5. We therefore now seek the agreement of our colleagues on thefollowing :  (a) approval of the revised proposals for a National Health Service;(b) authorisation to announce the Governments intention of introducing legislation in the new Session;(c) authorisation also to make a public statement in general terms of theform which that legislation will take.H. U. W.R.11th June, 1945.APPENDIX.The Main Changes proposed in the National Health Service Scheme setout in the Original White Paper of 1944.I. Cen tral organisation.(1) Central advisory machinery.THE White Paper proposed that a central advisory body should be created,representing all the professional and expert points of view with special sub-committees on particular aspects of the service, and that the Minister should report annually to Parliament on this advisory&quot;s body&apos;s work during the year.It is now proposed that there should be a centra.! advisory body, together withStanding Advisory Committees on special subjects, that the central body shoulditself prepare a report on its own work and that of the Committees, and that theMinister should publish the report except in so far as he may decide that it isnot in the public interest to do so.[30053]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT
(2) Central Medical Board.In agreement with the representatives of the medical profession, it isproposed for England and Wales&quot;to droj) the Central Medical Board of the white paper. The two main powers whichiTwas to exercise can, it is suggested later,be dropped; the Board itself would then become an unnecessary piece ofmachinery.II. Local organisation.(1) Area planning bodies.The White Paper proposed Joint Authorities (about 30-35 for England andWales) which would plan all the health services in their areas and would also take over the hospitals of the counties and county boroughs. The joint authorities were to be joint boards of these counties and county boroughs. Bytheir side would be separate advisory bodies with professional and voluntaryhospital representation.It is now proposed that the Joint Authority shall be only a planning authority and, as such, should take in a proportion of direct professional and voluntaryhospital representation. All executive local government functions under the areaplans will rest with the counties and county boroughs. The hospital part of theplan, in which the partnership of the voluntary and municipal hospitals has tobe fostered, will be prepared in the first instance by a special group (halfvoluntary, half municipal). No agreement has yet been reached on the applicationof this system to London, but the same general principles will be applied.(2) Regional Councils.The White Paper contemplated the appointment of Regional bodies for the single purpose of &quot;vetting&quot; the specialists employed in the hospital andconsultant service.It is now proposed that the Minister should appoint expert Regional Councils(composed of a small number of university, medical, voluntary hospital and localgovernment experts) with this and other wider functions. Public responsibilityfor planning the new service will rest squarely on the Minister and area planningbodies with an elective majority; but the Regional Councils will be brought inas advisers at all stages of the planning, and will thus bring to bear on the new service the influence of the university medical schools.III. General practitioner service.(1) Health Centres.The white Paper proposed a trial, on a wide scale, of the method ofgrouping medical practice in publicly provided health centres. It proposed theprovision of these centres, where decided upon, by the county and county borough councils. Whereas the ordinary doctor, in separate practice, would be in contract with a new Central Medical Board and not with any local authority, the doctorworking in a health centre would be in joint contract both with that Board andwith the county or county borough council providing the centre. Whereas, also,the doctor in separate practice would be paid by capitation fee in accordancewith the number of patients on his list, the doctors in a health centre would bepaid either by salary or by some other system avoiding mutual competition for patients.It is now proposed that the trial of the health centre system, in which health centres of various kinds will be tried in various areas, shall be under close central control by the Minister with the aid of his advisory committees. The centresapproved will be provided, staffed (nurses, receptionists, &amp;c.) and maintained bythe local authorities. The doctors agreeing to practise in them will remain inthe came contractual position as doctors outside them, i.e., in contract with thenew form of local committees described below as taking the place of the CentralMedical Board. The local authority and the new local committee will make arrangements between themselves whereby the committee, in contract with the doctors, will arrange for the medical staffing of the centres. The remuneration of the doctors will then be normally on the basis of a group partnership, in whichthe aggregate moneys due on the capitation system to all these doctors will bethe subject of an agreed share-out.(2) Central Medical Board.The Central Medical Board proposed in the White Paper was to be a professional body, under the Ministers general direction, to contract with the doctors in the general practitioner service. As already explained, this is not nowneeded.
The service can be organised on the general lines of the present national health Insurance system. New local committees will be substituted for thepresent &quot;Insurance Committees.&quot; These will consist as to one-half of laymen(appointed by the local authority as to two-thirds and by the Minister as toone-third) and as to one-half of professional people giving the local service, the doctors, dentists and chemists. In general, the present system of disciplinarysub-committees, appeals to the Minister, local professional bodies for consulta-tion, &amp;c, will be followed.(3) &apos;&apos; Direction &apos;&apos; of doctors.The White Paper suggested two powers which should be exercised by theCentral Medical Board (a) the power to require a young doctor to give eitherfull-time service, if he wanted to join the service in some particular area where this requirement was felt to be desirable, and (b) the power to refuse consent to the starting or taking over of practices in the public service in particular areas while other areas were inadequately served.It is now proposed to drop both these proposals and to deal with their object of improving distribution of doctors by the opposite means, of positiveinducement by more attractive terms in less attractive areas, instead of bynegative restriction. Also there is already a general power, in National HealthInsurance legislation, by which the Minister can if satisfied that the arrange-ments in an area are inadequate himself make other, special arrangements for ensuring a proper service in that area.   It is proposed to re-enact this.(4) Sale and purchase of practices.On the sale and purchase of medical practices, the White Paper offeredno decision. It was decided by the Reconstruction Committee (R (45)13th meeting) that there should be a full enquiry into the whole problem andits possible solution after the new service has had a few years to develop andafter it has become possible to ascertain some of the present unknowns e.g.,the effects upon practice values of health centre practice and that meanwhile the custom of sale and purchase should be allowed to continue. This decision has already been announced in Parliament.IV. Dental and Ophthalmic Services.In dental services it is proposed, in the light of the interim report of theTeviot Committee, to go farther than the White Paper. Like the White Paper,the new proposals cover priority dental services for mothers and young children(the Education Act having already clone this for school-children) but go further-in providing the framework for developing a general dental service for allpeople. In the present shortage of dentists there can be no promise of a dentistfor everyone; but everyone who is able to agree with a dentist to treat himwithin the new service will be able to obtain all necessary treatment without charge. The scheme will be based broadly on the present system of dentalbenefits under National Health Insurance.Discussions with the dentists have not progressed so far as with other interests, owing to the need to wait for the Teviot Report. Further discussion is necessary and specific proposals are not yet ready.The same position applies broadly to the working out of a service for the care of the eyes, and there needs to be further discussion on this.V. Local authorities health committees.Under the revised proposals the counties and county boroughs would beresponsible for local authority hospitals as well as all other local authorityfunctions within the new scheme (whereas, under the White Paper, all theirhospital functions would have passed to new joint boards). It is now proposed tofollow the Education Act analogy in making it obligatory upon each localauthority to have a statutory health committee (like the education committee) andto include in it a proportion of experts i.e., doctors and others with special experience of the health services.VI. Voluntary Hospitals.Under the new planning arrangements, the voluntary hospitals will piny adirect, and not only advisory, part in the planning and arranging of the service
in all areas. It is also proposed to alter the basis of their payment from localpublic funds. The White Paper contemplated local service payments paiddirectly to each hospital by each new Joint Authority (i.e., joint board of localauthorities). It is now proposed to set up, for each large planning area, a&quot;clearing-house&apos;&apos; from which voluntary hospitals will draw standard servicepayments for all their patients while each local authority will pay into the clearing-house in respect of each patient from its own area. Payments between local authorities themselves will go through the same clearing-house. There willalso be provision for enabling voluntary hospitals to obtain necessary capitalassistance in carrying out undertakings in accordance with the area hospitalplan.VII. Other developments.It is proposed to add arrangements for two new services to be run on nationallines  a service of public health laboratories to provide a bacteriological service for the control of infectious diseases, and a blood transfusion service both usedon war-time experience and designed to carry the benefit of that experience intothe peace.VIII. The Service in Scotland.The same objectives and general principles apply in Scotland. As explained in the White Paper, however, a somewhat different administrative structure,chiefly as regards local organisation, is required to fit the different conditionsthere.Certain of the organisations consulted about the special Scottish features ofthe White Paper proposals, including the medical profession in Scotland, havenot yet made known their considered views. It is not, however, contemplated thatany substantial modifications will be found necessary. The most importantdevelopments in the Scottish proposals as compared with the White Paper areas follows :  (1) Central Organisation.The central advisory machinery in Scotland would be elaborated on the lines proposed at I (1) above.In view of the greater emphasis in Scotland on central administration ofthe general practitioner service, the Scottish Central Medical Board might usefully be retained; particularly if, as expected, the medical profession inScotland desire that this should be clone even although there is to be no board in England and Wales. But this Board would not have the restrictive powersproposed in the White Paper as regards distribution of practitioners; theproposals on this subject at III (3) above would be adopted in Scotland.(2) Hospital and Allied Services.The five Regional Hospitals Advisory Councils for Scotland would be given a more important place than was originally proposed for them in the white paper, in the planning of hospital and allied services. Composed of equal numbers of local authority and voluntary hospital representatives with anindependent Chairman, they would initiate the planning of these services by drawing up provisional general plans to guide the Joint Hospitals Boards in framing their area schemes.Owing to the relatively small population and resources of the average local health authority&apos;s area in Scotland, it is proposed that Joint Hospitals &quot;Boards(15-18 in number) should be retained as combinations of local authorities for theadministration of hospital and allied services.(3) General practitioner service.The White Paper proposal that the experimental provision of Health centres in Scotland should be undertaken by the Secretary of State would be retained.The Local Medical Services Committees, proposed in the White Paper primarily to advise the Secretary of State on questions affecting the general practitionerservice and its relationship with the Other health services, would also administerlocally the general practitioner service in the manner described at III (2) above.the composition of these Committees, operating over the same areas as JointHospitals Boards, would be equal numbers of lay representatives nominated bythe local authorities and of professional representatives nominated by the medical and allied professions in the area, with a few additional members, lav orprofessional, appointed by the Secretary of State.
