THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC! MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 14.4th June, 1945.CABINET.CONTROL OF LAND USE.Memorandum by the Minister of Town and Country Planning.1. Upon my re-appointment as Minister of Town and Country Planning, i suggest to my colleagues that the Government should immediately give some general indication of its attitude towards the problem of land use. The lastGovernment found itself unable to proceed with comprehensive planning legis-lation. Its inability gravely hampered me in the exercise of my new and far-reaching responsibilities and, I think it will be agreed, disquieted a public that had been encouraged to look for a determined effort to reach a practical solution.2. Admittedly notable progress was made in certain directions. The Act oflast year dealt in particular with the important and urgent issues of reconstruc-tion in war-damaged areas, and fixed for a period of five years the price-level for the compulsory purchase of land. But it expressly left untouched the funda-mental problems of compensation and betterment, for the solution of whichproposals were advanced in the White Paper (Cmd. 6537) on the Control ofLand Use. In general, therefore, until some such proposals become law, I haveto rely upon the powers contained in the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932,and in the Interim Development Act, 1943. The 1932 Act is recognised to bedeficient in many fundamental respects, and under it a burdensome code ofcompensation can be invoked against any energetic Authority.- The 1943 InterimDevelopment Act embodies a broader outlook, but it is only a stop-gap measure,enabling action prejudicial to planning to be postponed for the time being. Theproblem of compensation is shelved.3. Meanwhile, pronouncements in Parliament and more recently the white paper&apos;s proposals themselves had led the public and Planning Authorities to expect that planning would be armed with effective powers for its post-war task.The setting up of my Ministry proclaimed the same purpose. The heart of thatpurpose was to co-ordinate the use of land as the necessary foundation for anumber of related Government policies affecting many departments e.g., the immense housing programme, the planned decentralisation of our largest cities,the balanced distribution of industry, the preservation of good agricultural land and the provision of an improved highway system.-4.   There are at present two main obstacles to its achievement: (i) The execution of these policies would entail a liability to compensation,often of a crippling kind, and/or a need for large-scale acquisition,without the benefits of offsetting betterment accruing to the publicpurse.(ii) Compensation lies where it falls. For example, it may be right onplanning grounds to ask Authority A, a District Council, to preserveopen space in its area largely in the interests of neighbouring urban(and richer) Authorities B, C and D whose areas are already over-crowded. In that event compensation will fall on Authority A untilthe White Paper&apos;s proposal for centralisation of finance takes effect.5. Nevertheless, I have consistently urged Planning Authorities not to allowconsiderations of compensation wrongly to prevent or distort good planning, andhave been guiding them, regionally and locally, to prepare sound and right plans[30006]Copy No.
in readiness for enabling legislation. Many, although by no means all, Authoritieshave been following my advice. Some of the plans for heavily-blitzed towns,e.g., Plymouth, and the two Abercrombie Plans for the County of London andGreat London areas may be cited as notable examples of bold and progressiveproposals for development.6. But we have reached a time when paper proposals, however soundly theymay be based upon a proper conception of planning needs, are in danger ofbeing jettisoned because legislative reinforcement is lacking. The resumption ofbuilding for peace-time purposes is now an imminent prospect, and it casts along shadow before it. Land may have to be selected two to three years inadvance of actual building, in order to allow time for its acquisition, preparation and servicing. Already, therefore, over wide areas of the country building possi-bilities are becoming sufficiently concrete for old development values to recovertheir sting and for new values to acquire one.7. These values arise most noticeably on islands of unbuiit-on land incongested areas and on the fringes of towns, especially where roads and services are already present or in prospect. But it is precisely in these areas particu-larly in and around the larger conurbations which between them account for nearly one-half of the total population of England and Wales that further buildings should be most carefully controlled and in many cases prevented. In a recentsurvey of certain suburban districts of London, for instance, pre-war projects of a wrong kind many of them already carrying planning permissions reached a formidable total.8. As time passes without the introduction of Government legislation,Planning Authorities naturally grow increasingly doubtful about its enactment.Some hesitate to proceed with planning proposals at all; others, when faced withinterim development applications, decide not to lay themselves open to a liability for compensation, avhich, should it mature, might well place on them too heavy a burden. Nevertheless, such decisions are frequently contrary to soundplanning.9. In short, in present circumstances, a plan may propose, but fear (ofcompensation) disposes. The dilemma confronts me in rural as wrell as in urban areas; and with industrial and commercial projects as well as with the morefamiliar housing programmes. But at present the last-named naturally providethe bulk of the cases, and have already created grave difficulties for my Depart-ment and the Ministry of Health. In particular in Greater London&quot; where a provisional plan is already in being, we can most easily contrast intention and performance over a whole region. By comparison with the Abercrombie plan which represents broadly what is desirable the serious consequences to a wdioleregion of present difficulties in implementing it are plainly seen.10. Accordingly I feel it right that my colleagues should immediately bemade aware of my anxiety that the ground is fast slipping from underneathour feet. Evidence is accumulating that the prospects of good land-planning arealready being seriously prejudiced. This is tantamount to saying that some ofthe foundations of the reconstruction programme as a whole are in danger of beingundermined. It is a truism for this Government as for the last that all the&quot; related parts of a single reconstruction programme involve the use of land.&quot;(Cmd. 6537, paragraph 1).11.   I therefore ask my colleagues to empower me to make a statement toI the effect that, if returned, the Government intend to proceed to early and com-I prehensive legislation broadly securing the main objects of the scheme containedI in paragraph 16 of the White Paper, although its exact provisions would be thei subject of further review and discussion.   I should then propose to discuss withthe Housing Committee and with the Chancellor of the Exchequer what arrange-ments can be made with local authorities to ensure that in the meantime theposition is not prejudiced.W.
