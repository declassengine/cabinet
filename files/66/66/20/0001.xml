THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT70Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1945.SECRETCP. (45) 20.7th June, 1945.CABINET.ITALIAN PRISONERS OF WAR.Memorandum by the Minister of Education.1. A.F.H.Q., Central Mediterranean, have reported that the United StatesGovernment, with the concurrence of the Italian Government, have decided to repatriate 33,000 Italian co-operator prisoners of war from the United States inshipments of 10,000 starting early in July.2. After considering the memorandum by the Secretary of State for War(W.P. (44) 292) the War Cabinet decided on the 18th May that no steps shouldbe taken to repatriate Italian prisoners of war without further reference to ministers. On the other hand, I understand that arrangements are being madeto hold the necessary number of German prisoners of war for eventual substitu-tion for Italians when the time comes to repatriate the latter.3. In view of the American decision referred to in paragraph 1 above, Iwould ask my colleagues immediately to agree to the principle that italian prisoners of war in British hands shall be repatriated as and when opportunitiesarise and German replacements can be made available. I appreciate thattransport difficulties make it impossible to undertake any large-scale movementsfor some time to come. There may, however, be opportunities from time to timeof repatriating batches of Italians, and the psychological and political effect ofthis would be considerable. For example, I understand that air transport maybe used for bringing troops from Italy to various theatres for redeployment. Suchtransport could perhaps be used for carrying Italian prisoners of war back toItaly. I believe also that the Admiralty contemplate the use of Italian cruisersfor movements connected with redeployment. I do not doubt that examinationwould reveal many other possibilities.4. I regard it as highly important for political reasons that such a decision should be taken and announced to the Italian Government at this stage. the prisoners of war field is practically the only one in which we are in a position tohelp the moderate elements in the Italian Government and in Italy at large wholook to us for support. The credit which would accrue to us for such a decisions would be quite out of proportion to the limited scale of repatriation which could in fact be achieved. Moreover, in view of the American action I do not see how we can take any other course. I do not think that a favourable decision would cost us anything, seeing that we hold the necessary German replacements. On thecontrary, it appears that if we retain the Italian prisoners of war as well as theGerman replacements we incur a double burden.5. The decision which I hope the Cabinet will take should of course becommunicated as soon as possible to the Dominion Governments, who, I under-stand,- have yet to submit their requirements of German prisoners of war.R.
