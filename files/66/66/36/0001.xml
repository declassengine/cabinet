THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1945.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 36.14th&apos;June, 1945.CABINET.INDUSTRIAL DISARMAMENT OF GERMANY.Memorandum by the Minister of State.ON the 11th June the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (45) 16) on Reparations, Annex I of which contained the draft of a directive for the United Kingdom Representative on the MoscowCommission on Reparation. The Cabinet appointed a Committee of ministers under the Chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider on their behalf, and refer to the Cabinet as necessary, all questions which may arise fromthe proceedings of the Moscow Commission and invited this Committee to review,in the light of the CabineCs discussions, the draft instructions embodied in annex I of CP. (45) 16; and to communicate the revised instructions on behalfof the Cabinet to the Solicitor-General for his guidance at the MoscowReparation Commission (Cabinet, Conclusion 7 (45), Minute 2). The Chancellors&apos; Committee have examined the directive and. subject to certain amendments,approved it. The United Kingdom Delegation to the Moscow Commission willbe leaving this country on or about the 18th June.2. Policy for exacting reparation from Germany must of necessity be closely linked with policy for the industrial disarmament of Germany.Reparation and industrial disarmament cannot be considered in isolation, since it is specifically provided in the protocol of the Crimea Conference dealing withreparation that the removals to be made from the national wealth of Germanywithin two years from her surrender are to be carried out chiefly for the purposeof destroying the war potential of Germany. It will, therefore, be necessary forthe British Delegation to the Reparation Commission to be aware of the policyof industrial disarmament which His Majesty&apos;s Government would wish to applyto Germany.3. Apart from the necessity of acquainting the British Delegation to the moscow Commission with His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy in the field ofindustrial disarmament, it is desirable for other reasons to determine what our policy should be. The policy ultimately to be adopted in Germany will requirethe agreement of the four Controlling Powers, and the sooner His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s proposals, or at all events some part of them, can be circulatedto the European Advisory Commission, the better. Even so, their considerationby the European Advisory Commission may take time; and I think it would be wise to reach an agreement at an early date with the United States and french governments upon at least a preliminary list of measures which the respectiveCommanders-in-Chief can put in hand immediately in those areas, now underSupreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force&apos;s occupation, which willin due course become the British, United States and French zones of occupation.Although, too, the first meeting of the Control Council has taken place, sometime will elapse before the Control Commission is in effective operation and unless some action is taken in the meantime there may be considerable-and dangerousdelay in starting the programme of industrial disarmament.4. At their meeting on the 10th May (A.P.W. (45) 11th Meeting) theArmistice and Post-War Committee considered a report by the Economic andIndustrial Planning Staff on the disarmament of German industrial war potential(A.P.W. (45) 57).   My colleagues will haw received a copy of this paper and of12819   [30072]
the relevant minutes of the Committee. The Armistice and Post-War committee agreed that, subject to certain points recorded in their minutes, the proposals set out in paragraphs 7 to 18 of A.P.W. (45) 57 Annex should be used as guidancefor the United Kingdom Representative on the European x\advisory Commission,for the Commander-in-Chief of the British Zone in Germany, for the british element of the Control Commission for Germany, and for the United kingdom delegation to the Moscow Reparation Commission.5. I accordingly invite my colleagues to approve the following course ofaction :  (a) The recommendations of the Armistice and Post-War Committee in thismatter should be confirmed.(b) The Representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the european advisory Commission, Sir R. I. Campbell, should be authorised tosubmit to the Commission a memorandum on the lines of the draffcattached as Annex to this paper.(c) As soon as this paper has been tabled at the European Advisory Commis-sion. and provided it does not appear that it will be discussed in theimmediate future, Sir R. I. Campbell should be authorised to openinformal discussions with his United States and Erench colleagues with a view to reaching agreement on at least a preliminary list of measures of industrial disarmament which the respective Commanders-in-Chief can put in hand immediately in those areas, now under theSupreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force&apos;s occupation, whichwill in clue course become the British, United States and Frenchzones of occupation. If my colleagues agree to this course, I suggestthat it will also be advisable to arrange that, when our proposals arebeing considered by the United States and French Governments, therepresentatives of the occupying forces, who will be responsible for putting the proposals into effect, should be given an opportunity of expressing their views.W. M.Foreign Office, lith June, 1945.ANNEX.Note by the Minister of State.A.   I draw the attention of my colleagues to the following paragraphs in thei    draft [B] below........Paragraph 5 (e). The Economic and Industrial Planning Staff have not yetbeen able to produce figures for the machine tool requirements of Germany for a&quot; peaceful engineering industry.&quot; But I do not feel that we should delay the pre-sentation of our proposals to the European Advisory Commission on that account.Paragraph 7. Notwithstanding the decision by the Committee, I consider it advisable, for the purpose of reaching rapid agreement with our Allies on theform of the immediate instructions to be given to the occupying authorities, to exclude references to points which may be controversial and on which it is unnecessary to reach agreement with our Allies at this stage.B.   Draft Memorandum for the European Advisory Commission.At a recent meeting of the Commission I referred to the importance of early consideration of those points in the Yalta Declaration relating to our policy towards Germany on which no directives were at present before the commissioner to which the Commission had given no consideration. I drew attention inparticular to the following passage :  &quot; We are determined to ... . eliminate or control all German industry that could be used for military production.&quot;and suggested that this problem should be studied at an early opportunity.2. The United Kingdom Delegation have had under consideration for sometime the policy which should be applied to Germany in the field of industrial
disarmament Tor the purpose of preventing future aggression. They havereached the conclusion that this could best be achieved by adopting a drasticpolicy over a selected field of German industry with a view to eliminating thebasis of Germany&apos;s war potential. As for the rest of German industry, they recognise the importance of removing plant and machinery rendered surplus bythe imposition of the drastic measures referred to above and of eliminating otherexcessive capacity built up for war purposes : but they feel that any policy of excessive de-industrialisation would be likely to defeat our own ends in that itwould create conditions of depression and unrest under which there would belittle hope of the emergence of a peaceful Germany.3. The United Kingdom Delegation attach great importance to maintaining a clear distinction between measures imposed for purposes of security, and other measures which may be adopted for reparation or other reasons. The former, intheir opinion, should be carried out regardless of their effect on Germany&apos;capacity to make reparation for the damage she has done, or of the difficultiesthey may create for the occupying Powers, since the primary object must beto prevent Germany from ever again becoming a threat to the peace of the world.4. The United Kingdom Delegation recognise that until a thorough investigation of German industrial war potential has taken place on the spotit will not be possible to prepare a complete programme of measures of elimination -tion or restriction; but they believe that an initial programme can be prepared at once of measures for dealing with certain industries which are so important to the war potential of Germany that there could be no reason for delay indealing with them, pending more detailed examination oi the whole field. *5. The United Kingdom Delegation accordingly propose that the followinginitial measures should be applied : (a) Civil Aircraft.Elimination of manufacturing capacity and prohibition of production ofcivil aircraft (including gliders) aero engines, components and accessories specialto aircraft and aero engines. Prohibition&quot;of the possession or operation of civil aircraft.(b) Merchant Shipbuilding.Removal of up-to-date equipment from shipyards. Prohibition of thebuilding of seagoing vessels other than small fishing vessels. Reduction incapacity to build inland watercraft to normal peaceful needs. Reduction of theship-repairing industry until it does not exceed the size necessary to meet theminimum requirements of ships trading to German ports.(c) Merchant Shipping.On the assumption that all German merchant ships other than those essential for her coastal and short sea traffic will be surrendered to the Allies, theprohibition of shipbuilding coupled with the exercise of Allied controls toprevent Germany from acquiring ships from abroad will prevent Germany fromreconstituting her mercantile marine.(d; Steel.Reduction of capacity of 50 per cent, of pre-war capacity of 23 million tons.Prohibition of the restoration of any capacity destroyed or damaged during thewar.(e) Machine Tools.Elimination of manufacturing capacity surplus to peaceful domesticrequirements and prohibition of exports from current production. Reduction of machine tool holdings to requirements of peaceful engineering industry.(f) Ball and Roller Bearings.Elimination of manufacturing capacity and prohibition of production.(g) Synthetic Oil.Elimination of manufacturing capacity and prohibition of production.(h) Ammonia and Methanol produced, by high pressure hydrogenation.Elimination of manufacturing capacity and prohibition of production.
8. The above list refers only to civil industries, since it is assumed thatGermany will be subjected to a permanent prohibition of the maintenance of armed forces and of the possession or manufacture of arms and munitions and of plant required for their manufacture.7. No recommendations are made at this stage as regards the period forwhich the measures set forth in paragraph 5 above should last, since this is amatter on which no final agreement is necessary so long as the Allies remain inoccupation of Germany. Agreement on the above measures would, however, enablethe occupying Powers to start immediately upon a planned campaign of industrialdisarmament.8. As regards the timing of the proposed measures, the United kingdom delegation consider that, in general, measures of destruction or elimination shouldbe immediately put in hand and should only be postponed in cases where supplyconsiderations render this imperative; and even in such cases an announcement should be made immediately of the measures which it is ultimately proposed totake and the reasons for their temporary postponement. In the view of theUnited Kingdom Delegation the only industry to which such postponement should apply is the manufacture of ammonia, which will be urgently required for foodproduction.9. The list of measures set forth in paragraph 5 above is not exhaustive.The United Kingdom Delegation suggest that other industries which also con-tribute to Germany&apos;s industrial war potential in particular the remainder ofthe chemical industry (including synthetic rubber), engineering, light metals(especially aluminium), precision and optical instruments and radio should be examined immediately by Allied experts with a view to determining what further measures of restriction are necessary to provide a significant addition to thesecurity which could be expected to result from the imposition of the specific measures proposed in paragraph 5.10. The United Kingdom Delegation think it essential that early instruc-tions should be issued to the occupying authorities regarding the initial minimummeasures of industrial disarmament to be imposed; and I accordingly invite mycolleagues to give immediate consideration to the proposals made in the present paper.
