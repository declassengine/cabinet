THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPEIPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1945.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 2.29th May, 1945.//\\CABINET.POSTPONEMENT OF POLLING DAY IN CERTAINCONSTITUENCIES.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Scotland.IT appears that in certain constituencies in Lancashire and elsewhereWakes week i.e., the week when the mills or other local works close and a largenumber of those employed and others take holidays at Blackpool and elsewhere will be the week from the 1st July to the 7th July. In Scotland, also, there arecertain towns, including Edinburgh, Greenock and Falkirk, where tradesholidays for a week run from the 30th June. (The point was raised at a meeting with leaders of the Labour Party on the 28th May to discuss parliamentary business; the relevant extract from the minutes of this meeting is appended.)The question therefore arises whether there ought to be immediate legislation to enable the polling day to be postponed in certain constituencies where a largenumber of the electors will, as a result of local custom, be absent on the 5th July.Provided nomination day remains the same, namely the 25th June, it wouldbe possible by means of legislation to postpone the polling day without affectingthe date for the counting of the votes and the declaration of the poll. The arrange-ments for enabling Service voters to vote by post begin to take effect immediatelyafter nomination day, and these arrangements would not be disturbed if therewere legislation providing that in certain constituencies polling day, insteadof taking place 10 days after nomination day, may take place 17 or (to coverconstituencies where the Wakes week for part of the constituency is the weekfollowing the 5th July) 24 days after nomination day.Such an alteration of&apos; the law is a departure from, the general principleaccepted since 1919 that polling shall take place simultaneously throughout theUnited Kingdom. So long as the declaration of the poll takes place on thesame date in all constituencies the objections to having divergent datesfor polling are less strong than they would be if the declaration of the poll insome constituencies might affect the voting in other constituencies. Nevertheless,there are certain objections to postponing the date of polling in certainconstituencies beyond the date fixed for other constituencies.There may, for example, be objections to lengthening the period betweennomination day and polling day. In the constituencies where polling day ispostponed such disturbance as is liable to be caused by election campaigns willbe continued over a period of 17 or 24 days instead of a period of 10 days. Thelengthening of the period of the election campaign will also be liable to increasethe expenses of the candidates. There may, therefore, be considerations of general principle against any alteration of the existing law.On the other hand, it may be represented that if polling day is the 5th Julyin all constituencies throughout the United Kingdom, the result in certain placeswill be practically to disenfranchise a substantial proportion of the electors. Thequestion has been considered whether arrangements could be made to run specialtrains to enable absent voters to return to the constituency on polling day, butthe Ministry of War Transport are satisfied that such a course would be quite impracticable in present circumstances.[29980]
If it be agreed that there should be amending legislation to enable pollingday to be postponed in certain constituencies, the following subsidiary questionsrequire consideration :  (1) On whom should be placed the responsibility of deciding whether pollingday is to be postponed? To place the responsibility on the HomeSecretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland is open to the objection that these Ministers are liable to be charged with being influenced intheir decision by political considerations. On the whole the better course would seem to be to place the responsibility on the returning officer, but to provide that he shall consult with the candidates before taking a decision, and that he shall only postpone the date of pollingday if he is satisfied that, as a result of local custom, a large numberof electors will be absent from the constituency and unable to casttheir votes on the 5th July. In a Question addressed by Mr. McNeillto the Prime Minister it was suggested that postponement should only be allowed if &quot;no Party involved objects to the suggestion.&quot;This proposal, however, cannot be accepted. Apart from the fact thata political party is not a legal entity, there is the possibility that a&quot; freak &quot; candidate might object because he thought that his chanceswould be improved if a large number of the electors were unableto vote.(2) Should the Returning Officer be authorised to fix the deferred polling date on any day of the week ? As in the majority of constituencies pollingwill take place on Thursday, the 5th July, it seems on the wholebetter to limit the Returning Officer&apos;s discretion and to authorise himmerely to fix either Thursday, the 12th July, or Thursday, the19th July.Any postponement beyond the 19th July seems to be out of the question.If there is to be legislation on this subject, there will no doubt be a demand in various quarters for other alterations of the electoral law. In particular,there may be a demand for an alteration of the law so as to enable persons whohave left the constituency since the qualifying date, i.e., the 31st January, to vote by post. It is, however, impracticable to contemplate such an amendmentof the law because any large extension of the system of postal voting could notbe operated by the staffs at present available, and in any event time would not permit of the necessary arrangements being made. The carrying out of a generalelection will, in any case, involve a great strain on the Electoral registration officers, and any extension of the postal voting system would break the machine.If there is to be legislation to enable polling&apos; day to be postponed in certainconstituencies, demands for other amendments of the law must be resisted, excepttwo small amendments. Firstly, it is desirable to correct an omission in theprevious legislation for the purpose of putting Merchant Seamen who have beenprioners of war on exactly the same footing for electoral registration purposes as members of the Armed Forces who have been prisoners of war; the omission ofMerchant Seamen from the provisions relating to prisoners of war was due toinadvertence. Secondly, it is necessary to shorten the period between nominationday and the count in the Scottish Universities constituency; as the law stands, inScotland, the declaration of the University poll cannot occur until some days afterthe 31st July, the day on which it is understood Parliament vail reassemble.D.

APPENDIX.Extract from Note of a Meeting with Leaders of the Labour Party on28th May.LANCASHIRE WAKES :  EFFECT ON VOTING IN THE ELECTION.Mr. Attlee recalled that at the meeting of Party Leaders on the 25th May, hehad drawn attention to the fact that in several Lancashire towns polling day would fall in Wake Week, when a large proportion of the electorate would beaway from home; and it had been agreed that the Party Whips should considerwhether this difficulty could be met by providing additional facilities for travelon polling day between these Lancashire towns and Blackpool.Mr. Whitetey said that the Whips had considered this point, and were satisfied that the difficulty would not be met by putting on additional trains fromBlackpool. It was true that a large proportion of the inhabitants of these townsspent their week&apos;s holiday in Blackpool, but a substantial number went elsewhereand there would be complaints of discrimination if special facilities were givenonly to those staying at Blackpool. Moreover, a somewhat similar problem arose in other parts of the country, e.g., Glasgow and Northumberland. It seemed tohim that the only practical solution was to empower the Returning Officer in thesetowns to hold the Poll on some other day, to be chosen at his discretion, betweenthe 5th July and the count on the 25th /26th July. This suggestion would, ofcourse, involve legislation. It had been put forward by Mr. Herbert Morrison,and was, he thought, under consideration by the present Home Secretary.It was the general view of the meeting that a solution of these difficultiesmust be sought on the lines of giving to Returning Officers in specified areas a discretion to hold the Poll on a day other than the 5th July.
