THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 194.5.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 35.14th June, 1945.CABINET.COAL SITUATION IN NORTH WEST EUROPE.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and Minister ofProduction.IN conjunction with the Minister of Fuel and Power I submit for theconsideration of my colleagues the attached Report by the Potter-HyndleyMission on the coal situation in North-West Europe.2. There is no doubt that lack of coal is the limiting factor to further progress in the rehabilitation of Western Europe and Italy. During the winterthe position in some countries may be so bad as to have serious political andeconomic consequences. The only major untapped source of supply is Germany;and for transport and other reasons the Ruhr is the best source of supply. It isequally clear that the difficulties of getting Ruhr production going will not be overcome unless immediate and drastic steps, such as are recommended in thereport, are taken.3. The target for exports in Western Germany of a minimum of 10 million tons during 1945 and a further 15 million tons by the end of April 1946, canbe fully justified. Much more could, in fact, be absorbed by the western european countries and Italy if it were practicable to suggest a larger figure.4. The report is being considered by the Combined Production and resources Board in Washington, and I would like to be able to advise my repre-sentative on the Board that His Majesty&apos;s Government are in general agreementwith the main recommendations of that report with the possible exception of recommendation C.5. Recommendation H suggests that a strong Solid Fuel Committee shouldbe set up at Allied Headquarters to co-ordinate the coal and mining supplyrequirements in the general policies pertaining to solid fuels within the variouszones. Careful consideration will have to be given to the manner in which thisCommittee is set up. It must on the one side have sufficient authority to see thatits policies are carried out in each zone. While it is important that theCommittee should not attempt any detailed management of the coal mines in thevarious zones, its main function must be to secure as far as possible conditions (suchas the supply of food and living accommodation for the miners, transportationof coal from the mines, &amp;c.) which will facilitate the greatest possible productionof coal from these mines. This proposal also gives us the opportunity of raisingagain with the Americans the question of treating the whole of Germany, or atleast the three western zones, as one unit for supplies of food and other materialboth in and out. This and other related questions can, however, be left to come up later in the discussions. They are at the moment under consideration by theDepartments concerned.O.

THE COAL SITUATION IN NORTH-WEST EUROPE.Report by the Potter-Hyndley Mission to North-West Europe,June 1945.*Summary of Main Recommendations.A. That it be recognised by the highest authorities in the Emited Statesand Great Britain that, unless immediate and drastic steps are taken, therewill occur in North-West Europe and the Mediterranean next winter a coalfamine of such severity as to destroy all semblance of law and order, and thusdelay any chance of reasonable stability.B. That, to avert or at least minimise this clanger, a minimum of 30 million tons of coal be accepted as the requirement between now and April 1946, overand above that which is now in sight. The United States, United Kingdom andSouth Africa are now supplying at a rate which will contribute 5 million tons tothis requirement. There is, at present, no prospect of any increase from thesesources. The remaining 25 million tons can only come from the two other normalexporting areas : Germany and/or Poland. For the next few months, themaximum contribution of coal from the United States, United Kingdom andSouth Africa will he essential, but. in view of the inherent limitations to theamount which can thus be made available, this can be only a-- palliative.C That an approach be made through the highest channels to ascertain what relief for North-West Europe can be obtained by way of coal from Polish and German Silesia. Ten million tons between now and the end of April 1946would about halve the problem.D. That it be recognised by the Controlling Powers that the only practicablesolution lies in taking quite extraordinary steps to stimulate the production in,and movement of coal from. Western Germany.E. That a directive be issued from the highest level that, short ofendangering the safety of the occupying Forces, all matters pertaining to theproduction and movement of German coal are to be given the highest priority.F. That a pre-requisite to the stimulation of German coal production is toincrease the amount of food available to the German miner. This is essential forthe heavy work of mining, and would provide the only incentive necessary to work.G. That a directive be issued that Western Germany is to make availablefor export a minimum of 10 million tons during 1945. and a further 15 million tons by the end of April 1946. It should be made clear that this amount must bemade available irrespective of the consequences to Germany, and irrespective of plans for other industries or the internal economy of Germany, and that any action deemed necessary by the Zone Commander to deal with any unemploymentor unrest which may result will be fully supported.H. That there be set up a strong solid fuel committee at Allied ControlHeadquarters to co-ordinate the coal and mining supplies requirements and thegeneral policies pertaining to solid fuels within the various zones. Should itoccur that no representative from the Russian zone attends this committee, then it should function in respect of the remaining three zones.THE REPORT.1, In Combined Chiefs of Staff Paper CCS. 838 of the 25th April, 1945,the Combined Production and Resources Board draw attention to the criticalcoal position in North-West Europe, and to the extreme urgency of stimulating-coal production in Germany, even to an extent for which transport facilities maynot be immediately available.   We entirely concur.2. On the basis of the present estimated indigenous production of North-west europe, and on the basis of the military estimates of the minimum requirementsof Germany, the Mediterranean and the liberated areas in order to meet theessential needs of the Allied Armies in these areas and to preserve their lines ofcommunication by the suppression of disease and unrest, it will be necessary to* Where the word coal is used, it excludes brown coal unless expressly slated.
find something over 25 million tons between now and the end of April 1946. Inaddition, there are the minimum requirements necessary to preserve the reasonableinternal economy and the capacity for trade exchange of Sweden and Switzerland.On an austerity basis, these requirements can be taken as about 5 million tons;thus making a total deficit of about 30 million tons between now and the endof April 1946.3. The present rate of supply to Europe and the Mediterranean from thethree overseas sources (United Kingdom, United States and South Africa) is some455,000 tons per month. If this rate were maintained, about 5 million tons wouldbe available up to the end of April next.4. The contribution of United Kingdom and South Africa certainly cannotbe increased and may not be maintained. South African exports have only recently reached a record level, which, we are informed, is the maximum. Toattempt to obtain the balance of some 25 million tons from United States, evensupposing the coal were available, would present an impossible call on shipping.Apart from port facilities and the like, it would represent the full-time employ-ment of some 400 ten thousancl-ton vessels.5. It is certain, therefore, that the greater part of this deficit must be met from within the Continent itself. Whilst self-help to the maximum extent mustbe the aim of the Governments of the liberated countries, we are convinced thatit would be most unwise to count on production in these countries being raisedabove the level of about 70 per cent, of their normal capacity by next Decemberas estimated by S.H.A.E.F. and as already taken into account in calculatingthis deficit.6. In all our calculations, we have taken no account of possible coalavailabilities from Polish and German Silesia, about which we have no information.7. It is evident, therefore, that the main solution must lie in stimulatingGerman production and the availability of the necessary transport. Theconditions generally in Germany are such that this will not be achieved withoutquite extraordinary measures; measures which can, and will, be taken only asa result of a general appreciation that coal is by far the most critical item, andby a very special directive given from the highest quarter.8. At the moment,-the total coal production in western Germany is about30,000 tons per day, of which 24,000 are used in or about the collieries for collieryuse, including miners&apos; coal, coking, electric power and gas. The balance of6,000 tons per day of saleable coal, plus about 13,000 tons per day from 5-1 million tons of stock available in the Ruhr 19,000 tons per day in all is being movedfor use within Germany or for export. Of this 5-^ million tons about half is coke,of which a substantial portion is coke breeze. This is at present being usedmainly for export. A considerable portion of the stock of coal is needed for maintaining working stocks at the collieries.9. Present use inside Germany is restricted to the essential needs of theArmy, of transportation, of the Allied Military Government (including utilities)and of certain approved industries essential to the A.M.G. A small amount oflocal stock-piling of brown coal briquettes under the control of A.M.G. is being encouraged, as, at the present moment, brown coal briquetting plants are almostat a standstill until existing stocks are moved.10. Western Germany is thus taking 16,000 tons per day out of the saleabletotal of 19,000, leaving 3,000 tons per day for export. Of the 19,000 tons beingmoved daily, about 13,000 are moved by rail and 6,000 by road. No water trans-port is yet available.11. Unused stocking facilities for a further 2 million tons exist near the collieries in the Ruhr. Coal production already lags behind transport, and, there-fore, these extra stocking facilities are not being used.12. The total coal production of 30,000 tons per day is about 3 per cent,of normal. Transport facilities are already about 5 per cent, of normal andare increasing. The bottle-neck, therefore, is the actual production of coal atthe face, and this is likely to remain so; indeed, transport facilities show every sign of increasing more rapidly than coal production.[30070] b 2
13. The immediate obstacle to coal production is lack of sufficient food forthe miner. Until this is relieved, no other measures will equate coal productionwith transport facilities or bring coal production to within measurable distance of meeting the European deficiency.14. The basic food ration for all German civilians is 1,100 calories perclay. This is of the order of one-third of the essential minimum for a miner.Even when supplemented by the present small issue by A.M.G. of extra food atthe collieries, and by the miners on procurement from the land or other sources,the food available remains far below the minimum essential to enable a minerto give continuously a full day&apos;s work. A considerable potential addition tothe present labour force exists in or about the coalfields, and this is being addedto daily by released prisoners of wxar. Transport facilities to move this labour are steadily improving, but this potential labour force cannot be used materiallyto increase coal production until more food is available; indeed, it would be inthe interest of production to increase the food available to miners already atwork before increasing the number employed. A comparison of the prescribedcalorie intake of miners in the various countries is as follows :  Belgium ...............       4,104Netherlands    ...............      4,000France..................      3,392Germany ...............      2,800 (not yetachieved).15. It is understood that S.H.A.E.F. have already taken steps with a viewto ensuring that all Germans engaged on heavy manual work receive 2,800 caloriesper day. We recommend that a special basic ration of at least 3,000 calories perclay be declared for all German mineworkers. This should be in addition to supplementary rations served at the colliery, which should not be less than500 calories.16. We have considered the advisability of all food over and above the civilian basic ration being made available to miners at the colliery only, but weconsider that an improvement on the basic ration, as suggested, with the inevit-able sharing with the miner&apos;s family, would increase the prestige of the miner,thus helping recruitment, and would tend to prevent absenteeism.17. We have also considered the advisability of arranging extra food solely on the basis of *&apos;&apos; more coal, more food &apos;&apos; to each individual miner or team of miners, but we consider that it would be best for the arrangement to be on thebasis of a firm basic ration to each miner employed. As the potential labour force is likely to be adequate to keep pace with other factors for several months, suchan arrangement would at once place mining employment at a premium, and thuspermit management to enforce discipline, attendance and hard work.18. A target of coal production per man employed, averaging over a month,should be set for each mine. If this is not achieved, special sanctions shouldbe taken. During the next several months, when the potential capacity of thecoalfields will, in any case, considerably transcend actual production or transport facilities, the obvious sanction will be closure of a pit, thus forcing labour tobecome more productive at another pit or renounce the special food ration.19. Experienced German management is best able to manage a Germanmine. German colliery managements show every desire to be fully co-operative.They realise, at least, that, unless they produce coal, their means of livelihoodwill disappear. We desire to stress strongly that every advantage should betaken of this situation, and that military or Allied civilian control should be restricted as much as possible to the laying clown of policy, the rendering of aid to managements, co-ordination with other authorities, allocation, distribu-tion, and general policing. We have already recommended to the militaryauthorities that specially selected heads of managements should be asked atonce to make a written report on their views for the promotion of coal produc-tion within the areas under their jurisdiction. We understand that this is nowbeing done. Within the limits of practicability and general policy the tendencyshould be to follow the recommendations made, and to make it clear to the headsof managements concerned the extent to which they are responsible for imple-menting their own recommendations.20. E&apos;p to now, the general and laudable desire has been to maintainproduction or to put back into production as many mines as possible.   Having
in mind the large excess of potential production in Western Germany over thatwhich is likely to be achieved during the critical period of the next twelvemonths, we consider that this policy should be abandoned in favour of concen-trating on certain carefully selected mines from which, having in mind theircondition and the proximity of potential labour, it is most likely to obtainmaximum production and movement in the shortest time. Other mines in a faircondition should be kept on the lowest possible care and maintenance basis. Onthe few mines badly damaged, we consider that steps to rehabilitate should be entirely deferred, except for safety measures as they affect adjoining mines.In making the above selection, every consideration should be given to the advicetended by the heads of management.21. In so far as it may be necessary to maintain general standardsthroughout the Ruhr and Saar coalfields, respectively, e.g.. working hours,payment, clothing, and trade union activities, special steps should be taken toensure uniformity. If left to various individuals in different sectors to placetheir individual interpretation on general policies laid down from headquarters,inequalities will inevitably occur, with the resulting unrest and underminingof managerial authority. Instructions to this effect have now been issued byS.H.A.E.F. and need to be quickly implemented.22. Whatever may be the ultimate arrangements for payment or otherwisefor German coal in respect of reparations, we consider it essential that arrange-ments be made forthwith to put a price to the various qualities of coal, and toarrange for collieries to receive payment from some source. Any money thusdisbursed by A.M.G. could, of course, be recovered later from Germany whenreparations and the costs of occupation are placed on a definite basis.23. Complete and efficient records of the German coal industries and theGerman personnel operating them have already been collected by S.H.A.E.F.G-4 Solid&quot; Fuels Section.   These should be brought up to date and maintained.24. The records referred to above will aid considerably in compiling theneeds of mining supplies, and in meeting these needs from German resourceswhere now available. At present, there is long delay between the ascertainmentof those needs which must be met from outside Germany and the actual placing oforders with the manufacturers in, mostly, U.S. and U.K. Those in authority inGermany should be given greater latitude to place requisitions in bulk quantitiesbefore the exact current availability in Germany is known. Also, the channelsthrough which such requisitions are co-ordinated with requisitions from othercountries and finally rendered to C.P.R.B. should be speeded up and simplified.It is probably true that production in few German mines is as yet being seriouslycurtailed through lack of mining supplies. To a large extent, this is due toexcellent ad hoc arrangements made by S.H.A.E.F., but it is clear that thetime will shortly come when even present low level production will be retardedunless supplies are made available from outside Germany..25. The manufacture of briquettes from brown coal is at present almost ata standstill owing to insufficient transport to clear stocks. It is correct that suchmovement should not be given first priority, but urgent steps should be taken toincrease the productivity of this industry, which, before the war, achieved an out-put of 70 million tons a year. Brown coal can be won and converted intobriquettes quickly and with a comparatively small labour force. A production ofbrown coal should be aimed at so as to utilise any transport capacity available overand above that necessary for the movement of coal.26. The present division of duties between G-4 Solid Fuels Section and other military agencies, such as the Rhine Coal Control, is no longer defensible. Werecommend that early steps be taken to consolidate these duties, particularlyhaving in mind the above recommendations regarding the part which should be played by German managements. These remarks apply to the present period andto the time when the Allied Control Commission is functioning fully. We under -stand that S.H.A.E.F. and the Economics Section of the British Element of theA.C.C. already have this point in mind.27. After the termination of the Combined Command, and when the A.C.C.Like over, we recommend the formation of a strong solid fuel committee atAllied Control Headquarters, whose function will mainly be to co-ordinate thecoal and mining supplies requirements and the general policies pertaining tosolid fuels within the&quot;various zones.   We envisage that it will, be this committee
7 th June, 1945.which will screen requirements within Germany, and declare export availabilitiesprior to presentation to the European Coal Organisation.28. A special directive will be needed in connection with the screening ofsupplies of coal required for consumption inside Germany. There will presumably be a natural desire on the part of each Zone Commander torehabilitate the industries within his zone, first, so as to make the zone as self-supporting as possible, and, secondly, to provide employment so as to preventunrest. In view of the critical coal position, we consider that such a policy wouldbe unwise. Many of the liberated areas will shortly be confronted with anunemployment problem, and are ready and willing to manufacture certainsupplies which may be required by Germany in exchange for coal. Thus, if acuteunrest is to take place somewhere, as would seem inevitable unless coal is madeavailable, it would surely be better for this to occur in Germany than elsewhere.Should it become necessary to preserve order by shooting, this would best occur in Germany.29. The general position is, therefore, that a specific directive is needed tothe effect that Western Germany is to make available for export 25 million tonsof coal between now and the end of April 1946, and that, of this total, at least10 millions should be made available during 1945. To achieve this will call foran almost superhuman effort. Short of endangering the safety of the occupyingForces, the production and movement of coal must be given priority over every-thing, and other programmes will need to be curtailed or deferred accordingly.S.H.A.E.F. are already under instructions to do everything possible to increasecoal production : but this in itself is not enough. All those sections of the military control, and all civilian supplying agencies, whose functions in any way affectthe production and movement of German coal, must be made fully aware of itsover-riding importance, and must be instructed to act accordingly.30. Without any wish to be alarmists, we are convinced, after muchresearch and practical application to the problem, that, unless the productionand movement of coal in Germany is contrived to approach the target we have set, conditions in North-West Europe and the Mediterranean will become mostserious.(Signed) C.
