THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 1.&apos;lScr/ Way, 1945.CABINET.EXIT PERMITS FOR MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.UNTIL recently Members of Parliament have been subject to the same restriction-tions as other people on overseas travel. Recently it has been decided that members of Parliament may travel to France and Belgium, but as regards otherjourneys abroad they are still subject to the general rules governing the grantof exit permits. Broadly speaking the policy is that exit permits are not grantedto any person between the ages of 16 and 60 unless (1) his permanent home is over-seas, or (2) his journey is in the national interest and is so certified by theappropriate Government Department, or (3) there are urgent and compellingcompassionate grounds for the journey.now that the war in Europe is over the grounds for this policy of closerestriction are disappearing, and it is hoped that proposals will shortly be formulated to allow the free departure from the United Kingdom of any Britishsubjects except men aged between 18 and^fe^ and individuals whose names maybe placed on a small &quot; stop list &quot; because they are known to be disaffected. Itwill, however, take a little time to settle exactly what the rules shall be governingoverseas travel by the public in general, and pending consideration of this general question it is necessary to settle at once whether applications for exit permitsby Members of Parliament should be granted regardless of the question whether their journeys can be certified as in the national interest or whether there areurgent and compelling compassionate grounds.There can be no man-power or security reasons which would justify the refusal of an exit permit to a Member of Parliament, and the only difficulty likelyto arise from granting such&quot; permits freely is that some Member of either Flousemight, while abroad, make speeches or engage in political activities which may beharmful to our relations with our Allies or otherwise embarrassing to theGovernment.To maintain the restrictions on all Members of Parliament because some fewamongst them might engage in such activities is a course which would be difficultto defend, and it would be equally difficult to discriminate between Members ofParliament and to refuse a particular individual facilities which are granted toother Members of the House of Lords or Flouse of Commons.There is the further consideration that in practice it is impossible to ensurethat a Member of Parliament who has been given facilities to travel to france or Belgium will not, after he has left the United Kingdom, proceed to some otherdestination. Cases have already occurred of Members of Parliament who, havingbeen allowed to travel under the ballot scheme to France, have announced their intention to proceed to Italy or Belgium or Holland.An application for an exit permit was recently made by Major Mott-Raclclyffe, M.P., who had been invited by his Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Athensto stay with him during the Whitsun recess. The Foreign Office saw no objectionto the visit and, in fact, considered that it might be an advantage although itwas not possible for the Foreign Office to certify that his journey was in thenational interest. It was decided to treat this ease exceptionally and to grantl*ta exit permit despite the fact that the condition of a certificate from a Govern-ment Department could not be fulfilled.[29973]Copy No.
Moreover, in a paper of the 14th May (W.P. (45) 296), the Minister ofInformation called attention to an application by Mr. Rhys Davies, M.P., to go tothe United States on an invitation from the American Friends Service Committeeto address meetings.In present circumstances it seems right to grant exit permits freely to members of Parliament in advance of any relaxation of the restrictions applicableto the general public, and I ask that Cabinet authority may be given to this course.The grant of an exit permit would not, of course, necessarily mean that thetraveller will be able to obtain a visa or military permit for his chosen destV nor;or obtain a passage or the necessary exchange to maintain himself abroad. Theseare matters on which each traveller must make his own arrangements unless he istravelling on an official mission. The granting of exit permits, however, under defence Regulation 18 ought not to be made dependent on these extraneousconsiderations.D. B. S.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.1,28th May, 1945.
