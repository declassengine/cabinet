THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 9.1st June, 1945.CABINET.LABOUR SHORTAGES IN BUILDING MATERIALS INDUSTRIES.Note by the Minister of Works.1. I shall shortly be submitting a paper on the long-term requirements ofbuilding labour and factory labour for the national building programme.2. Meanwhile, I must draw attention to the fact that there is an acute shortage of factory labour for certain industries producing building materials and components required to meet the current needs of the Governments housing programme and other urgent work.3. The industries concerned and the approximate amount of labour requiredin each are set out in the Annex. From this it will be seen that the immediatedeficiencies amount to about 10,000. The production authorities for these materials are the Board of Trade, Ministry of Works and the Ministry of Supply.4. During recent months every effort has been made to obtain the labourneeded through the normal interdepartmental machinery. Designation and FirstPreference have been obtained in every case where it was thought that this procedure might assist. However, the results produced have done little more thanoff-set current wastage.5. The immediate effect of our failure to obtain this labour is that thetemporary housing programme, which started behind schedule, is being furtherdelayed.6. The labour in the materials factories must be provided at least twomonths ahead of the labour on the site. Unless the position is rapidly rectified,there will be a serious clanger that sufficient building materials will not beavailable to provide full employment for the returning building trade operatives,whom we are making such efforts to obtain.D. S.Ministry of Works. 1st June, 1945.ANNEX.The industries concerned and the approximate head of labour required ineach case are as follows :  Asbestos CementGypsum, plaster and plasterboardGlass and glass fibre ...Clay TilesSlatesStock BricksLight Builders&apos; CastingsCookers and other ComponentsTotal8003002755506002502.5002,5007,775Production A uthority.Ministry of WorksMinistry of SupplyBoard of Tradela addition, labour will be required in the immediate future amounting to 600for the Cement Industry and 2,000 for the Facing Brick Industry, making thetotal requirements approximately 10,000.[29995]
