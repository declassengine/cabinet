THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1945.       J---- SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 19.7th June, 1945.CABINET.DEVELOPMENTS IN CIVIL AVIATION VIS-A-VIS THE UNITEDSTATES WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Minister of Civil Aviation.1. On the 22nd April, two telegrams were received from His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington which are reproduced as Appendix I and Appendix IIto this Paper. The first gave the text of a Note from the State Department.This note refers to the exchange of Notes which took place in 1942 about theprinciple of non-exclusivity in the negotiation of air transport agreements andto later exchanges about the use by United States civil air lines of airports inforeign countries, including those constructed or improved by the United StatesGovernment in the Near and Middle East. The State Department then askedfor assurances that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not oppose the efforts ofthe United States Government to acquire landing rights in the Near and middle East for United States commercial air services. In the second telegramHis Majesty-s Ambassador reported the substance of certain remarks made byMr. Clayton of the United States State Department, alleging that the opposition which the United States Authorities were encountering in their efforts to nego-tiate air transport routes in the Near and Middle East countries had beenstimulated by the advice given to those countries by His Majesty&apos;s Mission.The Foreign Secretary and Lord Halifax advised that we should give &quot; a straight statement of our present policy in the light of the Chicago Conference.&quot;2. On the instructions of the Prime Minister the special Civil aviation committee of the War Cabinet held a meeting on 4th May to discuss the replyto be given to the State Department Note. The Committee recommended thedraft reply set out in Appendix III.3. In the Wilbur Wright Lecture which he recently delivered in London,Mr. T. P. Wright, the head of the Civil Aeronautics Administration in theUnited States, and one of the most important and influential officials in theirAir Administration, expressed his strong approval of the final British plan putforward at Chicago.   He said :  &quot;It is my personal opinion that the position taken by the british delegation in the final document suggested by them (in which are clausesdealing with the Fifth Freedom) represented a long step toward a solutionand can, possibly, with very slight modification, be made the basis of final agreement.&apos;&apos;Mr. Wright made it clear that these were his personal opinions and did not represent &quot; the present, or to my knowledge the prospective policy of the UnitedStates Government.&quot; But he added that his Government had no objection tohis stating what was his sincere personal credo.Ariel House, W.C.2,7th June, 1945.
From Washington to Foreign Office.(No. 2795.   Space.) 22nd April, 1945.NOTE by Clayton, text of which is given in my immediately following telegram, was handed to member of my staff on the 18th April. In doing so, headof Civil Aviation Division said that in attempting to negotiate civil aviationagreements with certain Near and Middle East countries the United StatesGovernment had met with opposition which evidently originated from HisMajesty&apos;s diplomatic missions in countries concerned. In one case a Governmenthad stated categorically that they were prepared to sign an agreement if HisMajesty&apos;s Government changed their present attitude of disapproval to one of approval. Stokely Morgan said he did not know whether this was a matter oflocal antagonism or whether it was a policy laid down from London. On being pressed to specify which countries he meant, Morgan said he could not do so and gave his impression of being rather short of concrete evidence.2. Head of British Commonwealth Division of State Department, who wasalso present, said that United States Government had from the beginning wishedto follow a policy of co-operation with His Majesty&apos;s Government in civil aviationmatters and that they fully recognised that we were at a temporarydisadvantage as regards aircraft production because of war-time conditions.It seemed possible, however, in the light of recent developments, that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were doing what they could to hamper the United Statespending developments of British Civil Aviation, and United States government wished to know how they stood in the matter.3. Both on this occasion and again subsequently I have been asked by state department to bring this matter to the attention of the Secretary of State while he is here.4. As regards references to previous correspondence in State Department&apos;^note the last document regarding &apos;&apos; no exclusion &apos;: agreement which I cantrace is telegram No. 122 from British Delegation, Chicago, to you of the26th November, in which Lord Swinton advised that no further steps should betaken until the Civil Aviation Conference was over. I note, however, that recom-mendation one in chapter eight of final act of Civil Aviation Conference is directed against exclusive agreements. This of course has no binding force. as for my note of the 16th February last it would be open to us to point out that state Department in first raising the question of civil aviation agreements in middle East stated to us in positive terms that they were not at that timeraising the question of &quot; landing rights &quot; which was one to be considered at andin the light of Chicago, see paragraph 3 of my telegram 5701 of 1944.5. There does not, however, appear to be much to be gained by exchangingarguments with State Department on previous correspondence. It would [group undecypherable] I think to give them a straight statement of our present policyin this matter in the light of Chicago Conference.6.   I should, be grateful for instructions.7.   Secretary of State has seen the above and concurs:APPENDIX II.From Washington to Foreign Office.(No. 2796.        .)22nd April, 1945.MY immediately preceding telegram.Following is text of State Department^ note signed by Clayton: &apos;It will be recalled that the Departments aide-memoire of the 27th, 1942.proposed that neither of our Governments would enter into arrangements in africa and the Middle East which would exclude Air Transport lines of the
other, and the Embassy&apos;s reply of the 28th July, 1942, concurred not only inthis proposal but added that such principles should be applicable throughoutthe world.Under date the 31st August, 1944, Your Excellency&apos;s Government offered a draft agreement with the object of implementing the 1942 exchange of correspondence referred to above, to be effective until such time as an Inter-national aviation conference might be held. This proposal was acceptable withminor modifications to the United States Government, which on the 2nd October,1944, submitted a memorandum with a suggested draft exchange of notes pro-viding that the afore-mentioned understanding would be continued until both ourGovernments became bound by a future international agreement on this subjector until terminated on sixty days&apos; notice.In a note dated the 19th October, 1944, this Government referred to foreignairports which it had constructed or improved in connexion with the prosecution of the war and expressed confidence that the British Government would inter-pose no objection to the efforts of the United States to obtain general landingrights for its civil aircraft and the right to use suitable airports, including thosewhich this Government has constructed or improved in the Near and middle east.. Your Excellency&apos;s reply of the 16th February, 1945, merely stated thatthe British Government recognised that questions relating to the use of airfieldswere a matter for discussion between the United States Government and near and Middle East Governments concerned.The ETnited States Government naturally proceeded on that basis, andrecently proposed the negotiation of bilateral air transport agreements with anumber of Near and Middle East Governments. These draft agreements, whichare based on the indicated forms drawn up at the Chicago Aviation Conference,provide for the use of suitable airports on a non-discriminatory basis.However, since your Excellency&apos;s note of the 16th February, 1945, refersexclusively to airfields and refrains from mentioning general landing rights, andin the absence of a reply to the Departments memorandum of the2nd October, 1944, the United States Government believe it an opportune timeto make enquiry on the overall subject. Specifically, this Government would welcome assurances that the British Government will not oppose the efforts ofthe United States Government to acquire landing rights at this time in theNear and Middle East for United States commercial air services.Inasmuch as discussions are in progress with several Governments in that area, I would be grateful for an early reply.APPENDIX III.Draft Telegram.. HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have not changed their adherence to theprinciples set forth in the White Paper on International Air Transport(Cmd. 6561, 1944) and elaborated in the proposals which they put forward atChicago. His Majesty&apos;s Government readily accepted the proposal thatFreedoms 1 and 2 should be freely given and received and will be ready to extend the Freedoms under that Agreement to every country which is or becomes a partyto it.His Majesty&apos;s Government had hoped and still hope that Freedoms 3and 4, subject to the associated conditions, might be included in an Inter-national Convention and that remains their desire. While His Majesty&apos;sGovernment proposed in the White Paper that Freedom 5 would more properly be the subject of bilateral or collateral agreements negotiated between thecountries concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to deal with thisprivilege also in a Multilateral Convention, provided agreement could be reached on the governing conditions.As it did not prove possible to obtain agreement on an International Con-vention for Freedoms 3, 4, or 5, these privileges must form the subject of bilateral agreements.His Majesty&apos;s Government have throughout made clear what they considerare the right and necessary elements in such agreements. In order to avoiduneconomic competition and reduce and ultimately eliminate subsidies, theyhave always maintained that the frequencies should be settled and varied by
agreement, so as to provide a reasonable equilibrium between the aggregate of services and the amount of traffic offering on a particular route, and that thosefrequencies should be fairly divided between the countries concerned. Theyhave proposed that the fair division of frequencies should be on the basis oftraffic embarked.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government also consider that any agree-ment should contain convenient machinery for the fixing of rates. They furtherhold that, just as they proposed an International Air Authority in a MultilateralConvention, so individual agreements should contain a provision referringmatters in dispute to arbitration.His Majesty&apos;s Government in any agreement would, where appropriate,require the insertion of a provision on the lines of a &quot; United Nations Clause &quot;which the United States Delegation accepted in principle at the ChicagoConference.His Majesty&apos;s Government would also, in any agreement, propose to dealwith Freedom 5 in so far as it is relevant. In dealing with this Freedom, HisMajesty&apos;s Government adhere to the principles which they proposed in the finalBritish plan, viz. :  (i) the capacity to which a through airline operator would be entitled inorder to carry traffic embarked in, or destined for, his own country;(ii) the air transport needs of the area through which he passes, judged inrelation to public convenience and necessity;(iii) the position of regional and local air transport development;(iv) economy of through airline operation.His Majesty&apos;s Government are ready to enter into agreements with foreign government on the lines indicated.With regard to airfields His Majesty&apos;s Government have understood that they and the United States Government were at one on the policy it was desired to pursue. The principles of non-exclusivity and non-discrimination virtually gaveinternational force to the Agreements referred to in the State Department note.Throughout the Chicago Conference it was common ground that it would be foreach country to provide, in its own territories, the airfields necessary for inter-national air routes and to have the right to designate the airfields to be used forthis purpose as is specifically provided in Section 9 of Article VIII of the InterimAgreement and more elaborately dealt with in Chapter IV of the Draft Conven-tion. It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government as they assume it is theintention of the United States Government to adhere to the principles to whichthey have subscribed in these documents.
