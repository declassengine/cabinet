US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRV1AJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMPrinted for the Cabinet.  June 1945./SECRET.Copy No.CP. (45) 12.\th Jv,ne. 1945.CABINET.FOOD AND AGRICULTURE.Note by the Prime Minister.I circulate for consideration by the Cabinet a draft which has been submittedto me for a section on food and agriculture in our Election manifesto.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,4th June, 1945.1. We must produce a great deal more food than we did before the war,because food is scarce in the world to-day, and in any case we shall not be able topay for as much imported food as we did.2. A healthy and well-balanced agriculture is an essential element in our national life. British agriculture will be maintained in a condition to enablethe efficient producer to obtain a reasonable return on the enterprise and thecapital invested, and to enable wages to be paid to the worker sufficient to securehim a standard of living comparable to that of his fellow-worker in the towns.3. We must maintain the fertility of the soil: we must be skilful in the use and management of our land for the production of the foodstuffs which it is bestfitted to provide, and which are most required to satisfy the nutritional needs ofour people.4. We need Imperial co-operation, leading to international co-operation,in the orderly production and marketing of food : and within this country weshall have orderly regulation of imports and improved systems of marketing ofhome products, such as are necessary to maintain stability and avoid the evils ofrecurring scarcity and gluts. For this purpose each product will be treated on itsown merits.W. S. C,[p.t.o.
5. Our policy will be one of guaranteed markets and stable prices. Inreturn for a guaranteed price level, all occupiers and owners of agricultural landmust maintain a reasonable standard of good husbandry and estate management.6. Within these principles the best results will be obtained by restoring thegreatest measure of freedom possible, and allowing full scope for each farmerto make the best use of his land.7. The function of the County Agricultural Executive Committees willbecome increasingly that of affording leadership, help and advice; war-timedirections and controls will be progressively reduced as our food situationimproves.8. Educational facilities will be developed as fast as the necessary teaching-staff and buildings can be made available. The extension of agricultural researchwill continue. The best scientific advice will be made available to all farmers bythe new advisory service.9. Provision of smallholdings will be resumed as soon as labour and materials can be spared for men who have gained ex23erience as agricultural workers.10. The new Forestry Policy will result in far-reaching and permanentprogrammes of afforestation.11. Better housing in country districts is a most urgent need. Largenumbers of new cottages in rural areas will be provided, as well as greaterfacilities for bringing existing villages, cottages and farms up to date. A wideextension of electricity supply, water and sanitation will be undertaken forvillages, cottages and farms. No less necessary are better communications, betterhealth services and better social facilities for all who live and work in the countryside.12. A policy on these lines will secure a prosperous agriculture. That in itsturn will bring benefits to town and country alike, and provide our people withvaluable food to form the basis of a steadily improving diet. As for nutrition,we must make use of the knowledge and experience gained m war-time, ensuring that the right foods are within reach of every section of the community, and thatknowledge of what constitutes a sound diet spreads to everyone.13. Our fishing industry must be restored with the utmost speed. In warthe fishermen have been out after sterner catches, and once again the nation hasbeen well served in danger by their skill and courage. We must rebuild theindustry and make it a way of life which will give attractive employment to thefine men it breeds.
