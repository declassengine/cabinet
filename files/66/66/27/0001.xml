THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 27.\lth June, 1945.CABINET.MINISTERS  (PRESS ARTICLES).Note by the Prime Minister.IN January 1923 the Cabinet decided that Ministers should refrain fromthe practice of writing signed articles on current topics in the Press during theirtenure of office, it being understood that this decision did not debar ministers from writing signed letters to the Press* to clear up administrative points onwhich public misunderstanding existed.2. This ruling has since been maintained by successive Governments. the rule was restated by the then Prime Minister in 1927, as follows : &quot; The rules which His Majesty&apos;s present advisers have adopted preclude the practice by ministers of journalism in any form; but this inhibition doesnot extend, and has never extended, to authorship or to writings of a literary,historical, scientific, philosophical or romantic character, for which thereexist numerous and respectable precedents. Information of a confidentialcharacter should be never used improperly by any person; and in particularthose who have held high office under the Crown are, in my opinion, under an obligation to consult the Government of the day or the heads of Depart-ments affected upon the publication of any confidential matters of whichthey have acquired official knowledge which may affect the public interest;and to obtain in any doubtful case formal permission.&quot;* It was agreed in 1028 that the writing of articles by Ministers to supplement the meansalready used for enlightening the public in regard to measures before Parliament and other administrative questions did not infringe the Cabinet decision of January 1928.
3. During the period covered by the General Election greater freedom can properly prevail, and Ministers may write articles in any newspapers in prosecu-tion of the Governments aims or in defence of its policy. No payment may,however, be received for such articles, and Ministers should be careful that theydo not show favouritism to particular newspapers.4. As soon as the Election is over, the normal rule as set out in paragraphs 1and 2 of this Note will be resumed.W. S. C.10, Downing Street. S.W.1.11th June, 1945.
