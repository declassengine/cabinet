Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1945SECRET.CP. (45) 42.20th June, 1945.CABINET.AIRFIELDS.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.IN my Note (W.P. (45) 110) of the 23rd February I outlined a procedure forformulating our post-war policy on airfields.2. I suggested that the Chiefs of Staff should first submit, for provisional approval by the War Cabinet, a broad appreciation of the military requirements for airfields after the war. A Report by the Chiefs of Staff is annexed. they point out that it is too early to frame even a tentative estimate of the post-warsize and defence role of the three Services; and for that reason they cannot yetprovide any estimate of the overall military needs for- airfields after the war.3. The Chiefs of Staff have, however, suggested certain principles on thebasis of which progress could, I think, be made towards the formulation of ourpost-war airfield policy- I therefore propose that this Report by the Chiefs ofStaff should be adopted as the basis for a detailed review, to be carried, out by theDepartments concerned, under the general guidance of a Cabinet Committee as suggested in paragraph 3 of W.P. (45) 110. I now propose that this Committeeshould be composed as follows :  Lord President of the Council (Chairman).Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Pajunaster-General.4. The Services now hold about 640 airfields in this country. Of these,about 460 have permanent runways, and 180 have not. It has been suggestedthat about 250 airfields will be required for the regular activities of the peace-time Royal Air Force.L-&apos;i008S]144Copy No. 3 3
ANNEX.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.IN the Prime Ministers minute of the 23rd February, 1945 (W.P. (45) 110),he proposed that, as a preliminary to a Cabinet study of the overall post-war requirements for airfields, the Chiefs of Staff should submit, for the provisional approval of the War Cabinet, a broad appreciation of the military requirements for airfields, in the light of their estimate of the post-war size and defence rolesof the three Services.2. We are of the opinion that a reliable estimate of the military needs forairfields on this basis is not possible at the present time. We are doubtful infact whether we shall be in a position to make even the most tentative estimateof the size and shape of our post-war defence requirements for some months.3. We believe, however, that there are certain broad defence reasons for retaining our runwayed airfields until such time as any of them become cleaiiysurpius to reasonable needs.  These reasons are : (a) The growing importance of air power as a factor in military offence and defence.(b) The relative security of airfields in&quot;the United Kingdom compared withthose in any other part of Europe.(c) The virtual certainty that in any future war in Europe the UnitedKingdom will be the main air base not only for the R.A.F. but also for the Air Forces of our Dominions and of manv of our Allies.5. The Cabinet Committee should arrange for a detailed review to be set in hand at once, airfield by airfield, with a view to determining, inter alia: (a) how many of the ISO airfields without permanent runways could be restored to agriculture and other civil uses;(b) how far the needs of civil aviation and aircraft production could be met by use of airfields required by the Services;(c) how many of the other run waved airfields, not needed for Service use,would be required for civil aviation or aircraft production; and(cl) by what means the remaining railwayed airfields could best be utilised for agriculture and other civil purposes so long as it is necessary toretain them as reserve airfields.Along these lines we should be aide to get to grips with the problem. Weshall make no progress so long as the issues are discussed in terms of global figures.w. s. c.10 Doxvnina Street. smi&apos;. 1.20^ &quot;June. 1945.
(d) The very long period (viz., 12-21 months) required, under peace conditions,to construct airfields, and the small number that we could afford tobuild at any one time with the labour force likely to be available ata period when all our resources would be strained to the utmost in preparing for the war.4. For these reasons we recommend that it should be accepted that on general defence grounds no large surrender of railwayed airfields should be madein the near future. This need not prevent a limited agricultural or other usewhere the airfields are not required for regular occupation. As the conditionsof the post-war world become clearer in respect of world organisation, finance and the general level of armaments in all countries, it may well be that a progressive surrender of the very valuable military insurance now represented by our airfields will become feasible, but at present any such surrender would, in ouropinion, be premature.5. Within this general statement of requirements we suggest that the AirMinistry, Admiralty and Ministry of Aircraft Production should, so far asplanning permits, work out and co-ordinate their needs for airfields, where necessary in consultation with the War Office, both for active use after the warand as reserves, and co-ordinate them with those of the Civil AviationDepartment.6. Concurrently, the Ministry of Town and Country Planning, Ministryof Agriculture and Fisheries and other Departments similarly interested should review their interests in relation to airfields, and set out the airfields where theyconsider it particularly important that buildings or roads should be allowed, or where there are special agricultural considerations. This whole procedure couldbe generally supervised by the Ministerial Committee which you propose in w.P. (45) 110, which would also resolve ad hoc any conflicts of interest which required resolution before the general review had been completed.7. We wish to emphasise a final point concerning the safeguarding of the approaches to airfields. Broadly speaking, it is not possible to find suitablesites for any airfields in this country other than those which have alreadybeen constructed. Since it may well be that in a future war we shall requireto base air forces in this country at least to as great an extent as at present,it is therefore important that the flying approaches and the sites of all airfieldsshould be permanently kept clear of buildings of a kind which could not beremoved without appreciable difficulty. We therefore ask that this general principle should be accepted as an additional requirement.(Signed) A. F. BROOKE.C. PORTALANDREW CUNNINGHAM.12th March, 1945.
