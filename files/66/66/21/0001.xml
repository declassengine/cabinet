(THISDOCIB:sPROPERTY 0]GOVERNMENT)HISBRITANNIC:AJESTY!SSECRETCP, (45) 217th Juno 1945CABINET    - TINDIANnPQLICYCopy No.,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for india circulate herewith, a telegram received from theViceroy reporting the result of his consultation with his council on the decisions reached during his visit, and aseparate telegram commenting on the discussion,2.     I agree with the Viceroy that the points made ley theIndian Members of his Council as reported in paragraph 3 of telegram 962-S are either sufficiently met by the proposalsalready approved or are impracticable.   In particular, thesuggestion that there&apos; should be fresh elections to theCentral Legislature before the proposed announcement seemscertainly ill-advised.3.     The further telegram referred to in paragraph 7 oftele grain 962-S contains a number of amendments to theViceroy&apos;s broadcast.   Post of these are small amendments of wording.   The only ones of substance are: -( i)     The inclusion in the list of those to be inviteeto the conference of Dr. Mukherji3 to representthe Hindu Mahasabha, and the leader of theEuropean Group in the Legislative Assembly.(ii) The omission (in the light of the attitude of council reported in paragraph 6 of telegram962-S) of the two senior members of theExecutive Council from those to be invited.(iii) The substitution similarly for Dr. Ambedkar of another leader of the Scheduled Castes, chosenon Dr. Ambedkar5s recemmenaation.(iv) The revision of the passage about the release ofthe Working Committee to read:-   i?I have not sofar mentioned a matter which I know holdsconsiderable importance In the minds of many ofyou, the release of those still under detentionas the result of the 1942 disturbances.   On &quot;therecommendation of my Council and with theapproval of PPis Majesty&apos;s Government orders havebeen given for the release of the members of theWorking Committee who arc still in detention.I propose to leave the final decision about theotilers to the new Central and provincial governments when formed,:;   (This is in accordance

with the discretion given to Lord Wave 11 in thelight of the attitude taken by his Council onthis question);(v)   The inclusion of a statement that theappropriate time for fresh elections to theCentral and Provincial Legislatures will he discussed at the Conference.4.    The only alterations suggested by the Viceroy in theofficial statement are:(a) The omission of the last six words of thefirst sentence of paragraph 17.   These are nolonger appropriate and their omission may he agreed to.(b) The inclusion of a statement about the releaseoi the Working Committee on the lines of 3(iv)above.   I do not think this would be appropriate as it is expressed to be an act of the Government of India, but I would proposeto cover the point in similar terms in myremarks after l have read the statement to theHouse,5.     I recommend that the Viceroy be authorised to proceed as he proposes and that I should make the statement in theHouse on Wednesday or Thursday noxu   I would propose toarrange for the text of the official statement to beavailable in the Vote Office as a White Paper by thebeginning of Question Time on that day.INDIA OFFICE.7th June 1945.

secret IMAKD CYPHER TEJjEGRaiIFrom   .viceroy to o o o Secretary of State for india dated l.,   7th Juno 1945.Superintendent Series.   Proposals approved by cabinet were discussed in Council on 5th and 6th June0   All members were present except Commander-in-Chief,   Mudaliar, andDalai who are out&quot; of India.   I placed proposals in oralstatement and did not repeat not circulate any papers.2.     Usman, lludie and Rowlands accepted the proposals but said that in handling conference I must be certain of genuine party co-operation before attempting to select new members/ I agreed.   The point Is, I think;/covered byparagraphs 10 and 13 of draft statement ana paragraphs 6 aril7 of draft broadcast.   Anyway it is one I had alwaysintended to make clear to conference.3.     Sultan Ahmads Noon, Ambedkar, Srivastava, JogendraSingh, Azizul Hague and Khare put in signed statements atsecond meeting containing following five points.First.   Declaration of ;;complete dominion statusforthwith&apos;5 should be made immediately as no national govern-ment can work under present constitutional limitations suchas Governor General&apos;s veto, overriding, power of Secretaryof State and commercial safeguards.   India is notinterested in interim arrangements but in final settlement and without suggested declaration proposals have no repeatno chance of success.Second.   If interim arrangement is inevitable it shbe made after and not before general elections to central legislature which should take place as soon as possible.Third.   If Conference is convened new members orCouncil must enjoy full confidence and support of theirrespective parties and parties must undertake to continueconfidence and support for duration of war.      .  .Fourth,   Members of Working Committee should be released before announcement is made.Fifth.   Conference should be enlarged to include representatives of those who have supported war effort.Asoka Roy said he agreed with this statement exceptfirst point on which he did not feel qualified to giveopinion.4. Benthall said, he agreed to a move but thought general elections to central legislature must come first.

5.     I do not think first point in written paper needsserious consideration.   None of the signatories could explainhow dominion status could be given without responsibility of executive to present Indian legislature which Moslem Leaguewould certainly not accept.   Nor are Benthall!s views at allClearc   I explained the objections to general election, inpresent atmosphere which would exacerbate communal feelingart;l would not produce fresh leaders or probably any greatchange in party representation,,   I accepted the third pointin written statement which is precisely the same as thatmade by my supporters.   I was also suite prepared on fourthpoint (and my supporters agreed) to&quot;recommend to Hismajesty&apos;s Government the release of Working Committeesimultaneously with announcement.   On fifth point I saidPremiers of Bengal, Punjab, Assam and FincTand ex-Premier ofOrissa had supported war effort, that others had not beenhostile and that we would not by-pass Congress and moslem league,. I had no intention of handing over ExecutiveCouncil to any one political party or to those who would not support the war.   Finally I said I would repeat Council&apos;views to you, but hoped His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldinstruct me to go ahead as I believed the proposals werebest possible at present.3c     On points of detail, Firoz favoured omission of membersof Council from conference as it is feared they may be accused of obstructing a settlement.   Amboclkar promised tosuggest the name of a scheduled caste leader as substitute for himself.   Council favoured inclusion of Shyama Prasadilukherji, President, Hindu Mahasabha, and also leader of mEuropean group in Assembly.   Some members favoured immediaterelease of Working Committee before announcement is made,but all would accept release simultaneously with and as partof announcement.7.     In immediately succeeding telegram I suggest certain minor amendments in draft of statement and broadcast.Changes in composition of conference are not. very important8.     Reasons for strong opposition in Council are obscure.Members are hurt because they were not fully consulted andpermitted to prepare a plan before I went home.   I explain,,that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have had good reasonfor annoyance if I had tried, to mobilise Indian opinionbefore discussions in London,   Many of them have grownincreasingly nervous and annoyed at political attacksduring my long absence.   Desai has been boastful andtruculent and members are still obsessed by the idea that cabinet have accepted his plan.   Generally there is an atmosphere of suspicion and hurt feelings, but at the attending was assured by Council as a whole that they would standby me until the results of conference were known.   Ambedkarand Sultan Ahmad hinted at resignation after conference ifit failed, but I do not think entire Indian element wouldresign,9*     I recommend that I should be authorised to proceed with proposals.   I consider early move essential and Council&apos;view that elections to Central Legislature, which could notbe/

completed for months, would improve matters is entirelymistaken,,   Proposals&apos;have I think a very reasonable chape Go10,     I know how hard pressed Cabinet is but hope thatdecision will be given to me as early as possible and atany rate not later than June 10th,INWARD CYPHER TELEGRAMFrom   ...   viceroy to .. c Secretary of State for india dated ,0,   7th June 1945.!64;a3Superintendent Series. My telegram 962-S of to-day.Discussions spread over throe meetings, one on 5th and twoon 6th June.2.    Main opposition is led by Sultan Ahmad,   I had a longtalk with him after second meeting*   He was friendly and said that he and his colleagues would acquiesce in myproceeding with proposals as long as I asked for nothingfrom Council but passive acquiescence,3.     Rowlands, who is known to Cabinet, recently saideuite bluntly that from administrative point of view thepresent situation was intolerable.   Many big policyquestions are awaiting decision which present Governmentof India are unwilling to decide while one outlook is so;uncertain,   A change must therefore be attempted now.and he was not prepared to submit to delay and uncertainty of general election.
