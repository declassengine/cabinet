Gibson, R.A., who was recovered from the Philippine Islands early thisyear) of conditions in prisoner of war camps in Singapore and Siam and of the struggleof the Philippine Guerillas in Luzon.P. J- G.. The War Office,x8th June, 1945.2030 hours.   February 15, 1942.   Singapore.Strange silence over the city as the &quot; cease fire &quot; becomes a reality. The Japanesewill not send troops into the city for 24 hours and we are allowed to keep 1,000 menarmed to act as police and try to preserve order in the city. I go to my gun positionin Government House grounds where we have been firing for the last two days. Theposition has been shelled continuously and bombed but casualties are light. The gunshave been rendered useless to the Japanese. Troops are rather bewildered by thingsin general and I talk to them and try to explain things. They have done all that was asked of them--none could say that they had let the side down. My two subalterns arein good heart, but very, very tired we all are. We give the troops a good feed thenlie down on the ground to sleep. A strange stillness broods over the city an unearthlyquiet after the constant roar of the guns for the last week. Soon we are all asleep andno awaking till morning. A Malay appears naked and begs for a pair of trousers.The Japanese have stripped him of his uniform and told him to go home. They are doing this to all the survivors of the Malay Regiment. Then an Indian soldier sufferingfrom shcilshock comes along. We offer him food but he is afraid to accept it andrushes away. My two subalterns and self go up to Government House to look aroundfor something to eat and find tons of tinned fruit and bottled food in the cellars. Wehave a Royal breakfast. After breakfast wc are sitting in the hall when the firstJapanese arrive four officers. We think &quot; now for trouble &quot; but the Japanese justlook at us and walk out ! Peculiar people. About an hour later some Japanese troopsarrive and by signs tell us to clear out. I go to R.H.Q. on a bicycle to see what is happening, passing many truck loads of Japanese on the way. They are singing andlaughing and wave to me as I go past. I eventually find R.H.O. on the seafront andreport to the CO., whom I have not seen for over a week. All the other troop Com-mandcrs are there looking for orders. We are told to assemble at the Volunteer DrillHall with all guns and vehicles so that the mechanism will be ruined during the rundown to the assembly area. The guns have already been dealt with. All the guns andtransport are in by midday and what a sorry sight they present. The Japanese arevery cross when they see the damage and threaten reprisals none taken. No ordersyet about where we arc to be imprisoned, so a couple of us take motor bicycles and ridearound the city. The Japanese are now in the town and sentries, machine gun posts,etc., are all over the place. They let us ride around unmolested. Back to the DrillHall and now orders are that wc proceed to Changi on foot. My CO. says &quot; Hell tothat &quot;;, and we grab trucks from all over the place and set out in parties &quot;for Changi.No one tries to stop us and finally most of the Regiment arrives by truck. Now the trouble starts and wc are made&apos;to take the trucks right back to the far side of thecity and walk back.
The Regiment has been allotted one block of barracks-rather crowded, but enoughroom for all to lie down. We managed to get three five ton trucks (abandoned in singapore by the Australians) full of rations into Changi so hope not to be short of food for a while. Get fairly well settled in the first clay. Main trouble is water. Work onsinking a well started immediately. Ready by next day and water supply assured.The men are a bit difficult but they are good fellows and will see things more reasonablyin time. They feel that they have been let down-who can say they have not ?-no airforce, no navy, no nothing. My Regiment was the first T.A. gunners outfit.to land in malaya on March n, 1941. This morning and order was issued by Malaya Commandthat all rations would be collected at a central depot and issued from there to units. Thiswas necessary as many units had no food and it was not known when the japanese would issue rations-if at all. Actually thev started issuing rice after about three days.We had one last good meal before handing over the stuff and then settled down notwith a very good grace to a diet of rice and very little else. Our initial efforts atcooking this rice were amusing to say the least of it. It either turned out a sloppy-mess or a solid slab. It was decided &quot;to get one of the Malay volunteers to show unitcooks how to deal with the stuff and eventually it became at least edible. It took somegetting down at first but when one realized that it was to be our staple diet one heldones nose and forced it down. We had cause at this time to bless the Malay CivilService. Some bright lad during the palmy pre-war days in the World&apos;s Playgroundhad a bright idea, typical of the things done in this outpost of the Empire. He decidedto preserve rice by adding powdered lime and some other chemical. The Japanese, ofcourse, found this rubbish and decided that since it was our idea of a joke we couldeat it while they laughed. We washed the stuff about six times before cooking it, but even then it had the delicate flavour of extremely ripe eggs. It also caused quite a bitof stomach trouble and even did damage to the eating utensils. Heaven knows what our insides were like. At this stage the Japanese seemed to be keeping no check on theamount of rice issued and we were able to bury large quantities of the offending rice, and use the better stuff again. The Japanese is in many ways a very stupid fellow and if one used a little common sense it was easy to fox him. The bad diet was now having a bad effect on the general health and malaria and dysentery were on the increase.Fortunately, at this time we still had medicine available. A hospital had been started in the Selerang area and in it were all the battle casualties. It was not any too wellrun and despite offers from units to supply cleaning fatigues, the medical people insisted on running the place entirely with R.A.M.C. personnel. About this time the Japanesevisited the hospital and found all the medical supplies in bulk instead of being hidden.They immediately commandeered large quantities-thus causing a serious shortage ofmany essential drugs, which was to be felt later.We were allowed to go swimming in the sea at certain times and this was very useful as water was not yet available in sufficient quantities to allow baths. One morning the Japanese cleared the beach and mounted four machine guns on the foreshore.Speculation was of course rife as to what it was all about. We were soon to learn.About 11 o&apos;clock some trucks drove up containing about 60 Chinese. These men hadbeen members of some of our Volunteer organizations and although they had goneback into civilian clothes after the capitulation, someone had given thern away to theJapanese. They were tied and forced to wade out into the sea, then the Japaneseopened up with the machine guns and mowed them down in the water. The poorfellows had not a chance. The next day one of them turned up at the Gordon&apos;s camp.He had a dozen bullet wounds but had managed to remain afloat and had got ashoreafter the Japanese had gone. He was looked after by one of our doctors and when Ileft Changi he was walking around quite fit again. The Japanese never discoveredhim.. We saw very little of the Sons of Heaven at this time. They had us wired in andsurrounded by the sea and seemed content to leave us to our own devices while theygot their P.O.W. system organized. Only an occasional patrol on bicycles rode round the roads.The most amazing rumours were being circulated. There had been a landing atPenang and we were advancing down Malaya ?   And so on ad finitum.Three soldiers of the Coast Artillery were caught by the Japanese in civilian clothesin Singapore. They had been sentenced to death. Lieut.-Col. Heath, their CO., andthe padre were allowed to be present at the execution. The whole affair was properlydone and the men asked not to be blindfolded. They died as a British soldier should one of them asked that his mother be told that he was never afraid of the Japanese.This was the first execution.All casualty lists were now completed and handed in to the Japanese. We all hopethat they will be forwarded to the proper source without delay we know now that theselists did not get home for more than a year. There can be&quot;no possible excuse for this sort of thing. A large party of British troops, including a few officers, is going off toSaigon. They are mostly A.A. gunners. Lucky people-suppose the French will help them in Saipon. We did hear later on that the ladsin Saigon had quite a reasonable time, mainly due to help received from the French people there.
By now Changi was beginning to look more like itself again. The roads had beenrepaired as far as possible by filling in the bomb craters with rubble and levelling off roofs had been fixed up as far as possible and the place generally tidied up. All unitswere starting gardens and life was going on in a fairly normal fashion. There was plenty of work to be done and soon the camp at Changi was running almost normal again.About this time it was decided to start some form of education for officers and other ranks. Among the Volunteer officers there were quite a number of professors and school teachers and we were able to offer a complete course on almost any subject.Candidates for these courses were selected on educational qualification and competition for enrolment was very keen. About the beginning of April the Japanese started to send large working parties into the city to be employed on building roads and shrines. Eight officers and two hundred and fifty other ranks from myunit were selected for one of these parties. We were allowed to take acertain amount of cooking utensils with us. We left Changi at 6 o&apos;clock in the morning and marched 26 miles carrying most of our kit to Kranji going into camp at a naval Wireless station. When we arrived in this camp we found it had been ratherbadly knocked about during the battle and that since then the Japanese had been using the building as barracks and the whole place was in a filthy condition. We even hadto remove several bodies which were, of course, in an advanced stage of decomposition.These were usually traced by the smell. After we had been there for a few weeks wemanaged to get the place into some semblance of order again. Our work consisted ofbuilding a shrine on top of Bukit Timah and also cutting a road and a series of steps upthe face of the hill. The first morning we were sent out to work at 6 a.m. despite the factthat some of the men were in an extremely bad condition after the long march of theprevious day, when we had reached our destination after 8 o&apos;clock in the evening.When we arrived on the site we found that there were already a party of Australians atwork on the hill . The Japanese guards gave us a demonstration of face slapping, using the Australians as the victims; this presumably was to show us that they intended to stand no nonsense. After the first few days things quitened down considerably and thework was not too strenuous. Rations of food at this time were extremely bad, con-sisting of rice, salt and one tin of M and V between 48 men. At a later date the rationsimproved considerably and became quite reasonable. We even had for about 3 weeks a daily ration of between 4 and 6 ounces of meat and fresh pineapples, also occasionallysome cocoanuts. The general behaviour of the Japanese during this time was on thewhole quite reasonable although we were always short of medical supplies. We hadone unfortunate incident on the hill when a Gordon Highlander was killed by an unexpired-ploded mortar bomb which he had picked up and was examining. Bukit Timah had beenthe scene of some of the heaviest fighting on the island and we were continually findngi^odies or allied soldiers in the undergrowth. These were identified as far as possible andremains were given a Christian burial. In this respect the Japanese also behaved in areasonable manner. About the middle of June we were all returned to Changi andwhen we got there we were told that we were going North on another working party.1,800 of us were put in a train in cattle trucks at Singapore on June 26th, bound for an unknown destination. A Sikh officer was in charge of us for this movement. We spent4 days and nights on the train in most uncomfortable conditions being fed at irregularintervals and finally reached our destination in an extremely dirty and tired condition.The destination was Banpong in Thailand. We were taken to a camp which had onlypartly been completed, the natives were still working on the construction of the campwhen we arrived. The camp had been built in some padi fields and when it rainedbecame a quagmire. Our work now consisted of building a road to Non Pladuk whereanother camp for prisoners of war was being constructed by prisoners of war. Thebuildings were of bamboo and attap and we soon became experts in this form of build-ing. There were no nails whatever in the construction; everything being tied with stripsof rattan. When the building of the road was completed we proceeded to constructvarious smaller camps on the side of the road leading to Kanburi; these were to accom-accommodate the Japanese engineers who were going to supervise the construction of the rail-way on which we were destined to work. About the beginning of October we were removed to Chunkai; here again we worked at the construction of a large camp whichwas to house about 4,000 British prisoners of war for the next four months and eventual-ally became the base camp for numbers 2 and 4 groups. In November, a fresh batch ofBritish prisoners of war started to arrive from Singapore. It was now the rainy seasonand as the camp was not yet completed conditions were most unpleasant, many of ushaving to sleep in the open in torrential rain. The camp was built on the bank of a largenvor and after a few days several of the huts which had already been constructed wereimpossible to live in. Some of the troops were only in transit at this camp and movedon, after a few days, further up the river to Wanrun. Work on the railway was nowstarted in earnest but for the period of our stay at this camp the Japanese engineerswere fairly reasonable and only on rare occasions did the men have to work excessivelylong hours. This section of the railway was completed by the first of February, 1943and we then moved on up the river to Wantakien; the people from Wanrun having alsomoved up a stage then moved on to Bankaw.  The food at Wantakien had been the best(22706) .\ 2
we had ever had from the Japanese and were sorry to leave the camp. After another 3weeks at Bankaw we moved back to Wantakien and we were given a week&apos;s rest. Duringthe time when we were at Banpong we had our first taste of the Korean Guards who wereto be with us from then on. They arrived from Korea about the middle of July and asthey marched into camp they presented a most ragged and dirty appearance. Theiruniforms were worn out and most of their boots were in an extremely bad condition.They were wearing British webbing equipment and were armed with the short LeeEnfield rifle. After they had been with us a few days they were completely re-equipped with new British uniforms. They appeared to be extremely badly trained and it usedto be a source of considerable amusement to us to watch them mount guard each morh-ing. Watching this procedure was not without its element of danger as quite frequentlythe odd round would go off; fortunately usually in the air. These Korean, soldiers arenot used in combatant units but purely for administrative work, although all of them arearmed. We found them to be extremely unpleasant in every respect. They were treated with the utmost contempt by the Japanese soldiers and vented their spleen on the prisoners. After they had been with us for some time, by the use of judicious threats asto what would happen to them after we had won the war we were successful in sub-duing some of the more vicious types. They had really no idea of the true state of thewar as all the news which they received was read to them once a week by a Japaneseofficer in command of the camp. They were continuously making attempts to spreadthis news among the other ranks but without a great deal of success. During thewhole time which I personally spent with the Japanese we had our own short wave radioworking in at least one of the camps and the news received was spread by word ofmouth throughout the camps in Thailand. This radio was constructed in a waterbottle by an officer who had been an engineer with the B.B.C. and was operated by a six volt battery stolen from a Japanese truck. When the battery ran down we used to exchange it with the battery in the ration truck which called at our cook house daily.This truck was driven by a British driver accompanied by the Japanese guard who wasinduced to leave the truck to have a cup of tea in the cook house; while he was doing this the driver did a quick change over of the battery. Despite the fact that on theseoccasions the vehicle had to be pushed to start it, the guard never tumbled to what was going on. Later when we had moved into the jungle and car batteries were not availablewe used torch batteries to operate the set. These were obtained from a Thai who was of considerable assistance to us in numerous ways. He was officially pro-Japanese andwas allowed into the camps to sell fruit, cigarettes, etc. This native spoke excellentEnglish and as we progressed further up the river followed us all the way on barges witha certain amount of food supplies. He was also able at a later date to procure for usinvaluable medical supplies which must have saved many hundreds of British and australian lives. Eventually he even cashed cheques for British -officers at very high rates of exchange. He eventually was under suspicion by the Japanese and we olid not see him for some time. He managed, however, to persuade the Japanese somehow thathe was on their side and to our relief returned to the camp again. Also duringour stay at Chungkai the Japanese had a sudden blitz on the officers. They claimed thatsome of the Japanese nationals had been ill-treated by the Allies in a concentrationcamp in America and informed us that because of this the officers would have to domanual work on the raliway. We, of course, refused and after a long argument theyfinally paraded all the fit officers one morning. We were surrounded by an armedguard who were ordered to load their rifles by the Japanese officer. He then haranguedus at considerable length threatening to shoot us if we did not obey his order to pro-ceed to work. We called his bluff and still refused, eventually he lost his temper andafter quite a bit of shouting and face slapping, a volley was fired over our heads. Weeventually had to give in as he threatened that unless we did the men would be given norations. The type of work allotted to us was bridge building which was the heaviestform of work on the railway and the officers were often working up to their waists inwater and for extremely long hours. The men, who had by this time become ex-extremely loyal to their officers were much upset by this treatment of us. The Japaneseengineers in charge of these officers were extremely anti and the members of the party had a really gruelling time. If the object of the Japanese was to break the morale of theofficers they failed dismally. After our \veek&apos;s rest at Wantakien we started on a ten daymarch right up to the top section of the railway. The conditions during this march were appalling as the wet season had now started and most of the men were now withoutboots and had very little clothing. WTe had to carry our own kit and also part of the korean guards&apos; equipment. The transit camps at which we rested at night on the wayhad not sufficient tents to accommodate even a small proportion of the prisoners andmost nights we had to sleep in the open. We had two very poor meals each clay, onebefore we left in the morning and the other after arrival in the evening. The goingduring this march was extremely hard, many flooded streams and steep ravines having to be crossed and we were only able to make about ten kilometres each day. We finallyarrived in an exhausted condition at what was to be our new cam]) for the next fewmonths.   This was Talanun.   These camps in Thailand were normally in command of
a Japanese Lieutenant with each group of camps coming under the command of a japanese Colonel. The British side of the camp was under the command of a Lieut-Colonel usually assisted by an Adjutant, a iriaison Officer whose duty it was to arrange the daily working parties, a Sanitation Officer whose duties were most important to the health of the camp, a Messing Officer who was in charge of ail cooking arrangements and a varying number of Medical Officers according to the size of the camp. There wasalso a occasional Padre attached to the camp staff. The Japanese staff consisted of anumber of Korean private soldiers and one or two Japanese N.C.Os.in some ot the smaller camps the highest ranking Japanese was only a first classprivate soldier.   The medical arrangements in all the camps were most primitive, there being a complete shortage of ail medical equipment.   Eventually we aid get a sufficientsupp.13/ or quinine to cope with malaria cases, but other drugs were extremely scarce.At one stage we even had to use banana leaves as bandages.   The health 01 the men was rapidly deteriorating and tropical ulcers were becoming very common.   As we had very lithe to treat these with apart from a little Mag. Sulph. and salt and water the ulcersituation became extremely serious.   Finally resulting in about 200 amputations done under the most primitive conditions.  These operations were often done in the open withmen standing by to chase the flies away.   It is a great tribute to the doctors that sofew lives were lost during the actual operations.   In May, 1943, we had an outbreakof cholera which started in a coolie camp just north of Tarsoa and rapidly spread rightup the line.   In some of the camps the death rate was appalling and it was all we could do to keep up with the disposal of the bodies.  These were burnt in considerable numberstwice daily and the remains were buried.   The Japanese had brought many natives,mainly Tamils from Malaya to work on the railway when it got behind schedule andthey were dying off like flies.   No medical arrangements of any sort had been made for those unfortunate people and eventually some of our doctors were detailed to attend tothem.   Each morning a burial party from one of our camps was sent to the nearestnative camp and their work consisted of the disposal of the natives who had died duringthe previous day.   At one stage the Japanese were even throwing the bodies into theriver as a means of disposaf.   Cholera eventually spread down the river because ofthis.   In one small camp a British soldier, who was the first to go down with cholerawas ordered to be shot by the Japanese commander.   Two Korean guards were detailedto execute this unfortunate man.   The British officer in command of the camp pleadedwith the Japanese to spare the man&apos;s life.   They were adamant, however, and the korean guards prepared to fire on him from about 30 yards range as they were afraidto go nearer; in order to save the man being mutilated by the inaccurate fire of the korean guards, the British officer asked to be allowed to shoot the man himself.   Hewas given a rifle and one round of ammunition and went close up to the soldier, whowas by this time unconscious, and shot him through the head.   There was an amazingsequel to this incident.   To fully understand this incident it is necessary to explain thatthe Japanese camp administration were at loggerheads with the Japanese engineers whowere in charge of the railway construction.  The system of working was that the prisoners were loaned each day to these engineers for work on the railway and they were constantlydemanding more men than were available.   When these people heard of the foregoingincident they reported the matter to the Japanese authorities in Bankok.   For someobscure reason this resulted in an enquiry being held and finally the two British officersin the camp were charged, one with murder and the other with being an accessory.   TheJapanese officer was also charged with murder.   They were all taken under escort toBankok to be tried by the Japanese military tribunal in that city.   When the british officers arrived at Bankok they were thrown into ajocal military prison and very roughlytreated by the guards.   They were made to sit cross-legged on the floor of their cell forhours at a time and were not allowed to wash or shave.   One morning they were takento the court to be tried.   When they arrived at the court they found that the Japaneseofficer was also there and he was in a filthy condition, giving the appearance of not having washed or shaved for some considerable time.   The trial started and after theevidence had been heard the prosecuting officer pleaded for sentences of death and15 years&apos; solitary confinement.   On the second day of the trial two Japanese doctorsappeared and read a long screed, which when translated said that these doctors had examined the British soldier who was alleged to have been murdered and had foundthat he was already dead when the officer shot him.   This, of course, was a completefalsehood.    The court then dismissed the charges against all three prisoners.    TheBritish officers were taken back to prison and the treatment of them changed con-siderably.   They were given a hot bath and facilities to shave and some good food.That evening the Japanese General, commanding Bankok, came to visit the officers intheir cell and amidst much bowing and scraping congratulated them on the way inwhich thev had conducted themselves in court saying that it was the way in which he expected British officers to conduct themselves. &quot;He then presented each one with acigar and some cigarettes, also ten dollars and told them that on the following daythey would be taken on a shopping tour in Bankok.   The next morning two JapaneseSerjeants appeared and took the officers around the town in rickshaws and allowed them(22736) B
to go into most of the large stores in the town. They found that most of the people in these stores were very iriendiy towards them. The tollowmg morning the officers were put on a train for Kanburi and from there were eventually returned to their owncamps. This story was told to me by the officer who actually shot the man. lire wholeaffair was a complete mystery to us all and we nave never been able to arrive at asatisfactory explanation of the Japanese conduct.Conditions on the railway at this time were becoming steadily worse; the japanese were intent on getting the railway finished before a specified date regardless 01 the costin lives among the prisoners. They had already made it quite plain to us that we werelucky to be alive at all and that we&quot; should consider it an honour to die buikiing this rail-way for the New World Order and the Japanese Emperor. It had become abundantly clear by now that they did intend to carry out this policy. Men were dying in largenumbers daily and all appeals to the Japanese were without avail. Further drafts ofBritish and Australian prisoners had arrived from Singapore on loan to the Japaneseengineers from the Japanese Malaya command. These people had been told when theyleft Singapore that they were going to fine camps and that any work they had to do would be of a light nature. They consisted mainly of men who had been consideredunfit for heavy work and under the bad conditions prevailing in Thailand the deathrate among these new arrivals was extremely heavy. They were treated even morecallously than the earlier working parties as the Japanese considered that they hadbeen &quot; dodging the column &quot; in Singapore. In one of the camps where these people were the condition of the camp was so bad that even the Japanese finally had to move the location. During one of the moves between camps an amusing incident occurred.We had several carts drawn by bullocks which were used for carrying the Japanesebaggage. As there had only been rice and salt to cat for the last few weeks we had become pretty desperate for food. One night seme of the Australians pinched one ofthe bullocks and took it into the jungle where they slaughtered it. The word went roundamong the lads and we adjourned into the jungle, tore the bullock apart and cookedlarge lumps of beef over wood fires. When the orgy of eating was over we buried allthe remains. In the morning when wc were ready to move again there was, of course,one bullock missing. The Japanese decided that it must have run away in the night;a party was organized to search the surrounding jungle. Unfortunately some portionof tlie beast had not been properly buried and was found by one of the Korean guards.This led to a considerable amount of face slapping and finally a team of Australians weremade to pull the cart to our destination; even then all the lads lent a hand and we considered it well worth it.In the latter part of May, 1943, and early June, the Japanese started to evacuatethose of us who were too^ sick to work, to the base camps at Chunkai, Tamarkar andKanburi. We were sent down to these camps firstlv in barges and eventually, as the railswere laid, by train. I personally was evacuated with chronic malaria to Tamarkan campwhich was under the command of Lieut.-Col. C. P. Toosey, R.A., who was the Com-manding Officer of the 135 Field Regiment, R.A. This particular camp had up tillthen been the No. 1 group base camp and had been turned entirely into a hospital, andwas one of the best run camps in Thailand. Shortly after we arrived a new Japanesecommandant came to the camp and he turned out to be in the main fairly reasonable.At one time there were about 3,000 British, Australian and Dutch in this camp. Thebuildings were in an extremely dilapidated condition at first but constant pressure by col. Toosey resulted in extensive repairs; all of which were done by convalescentprisoners, and eventually we even achieved some complete rebuilding. It soon became evident that this was to be the show camp of Thailand and we had an official mission from the Thailand Government one afternoon who were allowed to inspect the newpart of the camp. They were conducted on this tour by Japanese officials and were allowed to see the less seriously ill men. It appeared that the Thailand Governmentwere at last beginning to show a little interest in the welfare of the prisoners held in theircountry by the Japanese. We thought that this was probably due to a statement madein the House of Commons by Mr. Anthony Eden when he spoke of the dreadful con-clitions under which the British prisoners were being forced to work. We had an extremely good system working in this camp whereby each ward was under the command of a combatant officer for cleanliness and discipline, working in very close co-operationwith the medical staff. Regular inspections of the camp were carried out by ColonelToosey and there was keen competition among the officers in charge of the wards tohave the best turn out on inspection.Certain facilities for sport were also presented at this camp and each evening we hadbasket ball, volley ball and an occasional football match. As the men became fit againthey were re-drafted up country on to the railway, so that wc decided to cut out thegames to a large extent as we did not wish the Japanese to know which men were fit.We also managed to get quite a decent canteen running and the profits from this provedinvaluable in buying medical supplies. One day the colonel received a mysterious noteasking him if he required any money to be used for food and medical supplies for the sick men.   In the letter he was asked to give his name, rank and name of his bank in
England and a nom de plume, also to state how much money he would require permouth. Alter giving the matter considerable thought and discussing it with his staff ofwhich I was a member, it was decided to take a chance and answer the letter. Weasked for 12,000 dollars per month, ana trie letter was signed &quot; between &quot;. I he letter was handed to the British driver of the truck which brought the rations daily and he in turn had to leave it on the counter 01 a certain shop in Kanburi where he had to collect the supplies daily. In a lew days this same driver handed over 12,000 dollars in cashto Colonel Toosey. I was in this camp for five months and during that time the money-was coming in regularly. One can well imagine what a difference this made to our supplies of medicines and extra food for the men. The amazing thing about it all wasthat the Japanese never once made any enquiries as to where ail the money which wewere spending came from. As all canteen supplies were bought by the Japanese, theyobviously must have known how much money we were spending each week.While in this camp we saw an example of the Japanese version ol the Gestapo atwork.   Some of our men had found a Japanese tool store in a iar corner of the campand had gained access to it.   They discovered that there were large quantities ofshovels and chunkels in this store and they started taking boxes of them through thewire at night and selling them to the Thais.   They were getting 6 dollars per implementfor them.   They unfortunately were meeting with such success that they became overbold and one night  a Korean  guard spotted them.    This was  about midnight.Immediately all Hell broke loose in the camp.   The Japanese were running roundshouting and screaming and finally after waking up the whole camp they rounded up10 men.    Then the trouble really began in earnest.    They took the men into theJapanese office and started beating them with bamboos and any other article they couldlay their hands on; they then held one of the men down on the floor while one of theJapanese kept climbing up on to the table and jumping on to his stomach.   This wenton for about a couple of hours until finally Cloonel Toosey managed to have it stopped.In the morning the Gestapo arrived in camp with all their instruments of torture, which included thumb screws, hand cuffs, pieces of sharpened bamboo and whips, etc.   Themen, who had spent the night in the cells, were brought out and subjected to the mostfiendish tortures which included sticking lighted cigarettes into their noses and ears.They also gave them what they were pleased to call the water treatment.   This con-sisted of holding a man down on his back, placing a rice sack over his face andpouring water from a four gallon can on to his mouth.   The result was that within afew minutes the man&apos;s stomach was swollen to an amazing extent with the amount ofwater which he had been forced to swallow.  The next step was to jump on his stomachwith dire results.   All these were accompanied by continuous face slapping, with theresult that several of the men broke down and the Japanese were able to procure theinformation as to which Thais the tools had been sold to.   That evening the Japaneseaccompanied two of our men to their rendezvous and we heard quite a bit of shooting.When the party returned to camp they brought with them a couple a natives and thebeating began anew.   A certain amount of the tools were recovered by this method.The &quot; enquiry &quot; went on for about four days and in the end we were told that six of the men had been found guilty and would be taken to Bankok for trial by theJapanese military tribunal.   Later we learned that they had been tried and sentenced to 18 months&apos; solitary confinement.  They were taken to Singapore to serve this sentence.A few days after this we had a visit from a high ranking Gestapo officer who spokeexcellent English with a strong American accent.   He had all the officers assembledand spoke to us at length on maintaining discipline among the men and finally promisedus various improvements in rations and other things, all of which promises, needless tosay, were never carried out.At the hospital camp at Kanburi there was a wireless set in operation and by greatmisfortune, combined with carelessness on the part of the operators this was discoveredone day by the Japanese. By means of the usual methods the Japanese soon foundout all the names of the officers implicated. They were beaten mercilessly for manydays, one of them, a major, even losing his eyesight and eventually he died of injuriesreceived. This affair had repercussions all the wav up the line and many officers werebi ought down to Kanburi for interrogation. There were also very strict searches madein all the camps but fortunately none of the other sets were discovered although we hadto lie low for some time. In October, the Japanese decided to move all prisoners fromTamarkan to Chungkai as Tamarkan was going to be used for Australian prisonerswho were to be brought from Burma. The move to Chungkai was carried out by barges and every man, no matter how seriously ill he might be, had to be moved by a certain date. Large numbers of the men were seriously ill and had to be carried on to thebarges. There was one man not expected to live more than a few hours and we asked the Japanese to allow him to remain in Tamarkan for the few remaining hours of his life. This request was refused and the unfortunate fellow diedm the barge on the way to Chungkai. As there were two more days to go before theevacuation was complete there could be no possible excuse for this treatment. when we reached Chungkai we found that the camp had grown out of all recognition and that(22736) B ,
there were now about 9,000 prisoners in this camp, practically all of whom were sick.There were already over 1,000 dead in the cemetery there and deaths continued at separately of about 20 a day for the next two months. The sick were still coming down fromhigher reaches of the railway by barges, this necessitated a three day journey and theyused to arrive in a shocking condition. Barges were crowded far above capacity and asthe majority of the men were suffering from dysentry and were too weak to move therewas usually several inches of excretion in the barge, and on more than one occasion Isaw a dead man in the barge when it arrived. It really was a pitiful sight to see thesemen in such an emaciated condition when practically all of them had to be carried outof the barges. The Japanese were completely callous about the whole affair and wereyelling at us all the time to hurry with the unloading. The men had only had one mealduring the journey down and very little water to drink except what they could get outof the river.The sick were also being evacuated by rail and here the conditions were equallybad. They were crowded into cattle trucks and there were several deaths among them during the journey. The railway was finally through in November, 1943, and the generalevacuation of prisoners from the top end of the line was carried out during December,1943, and January and February, 1944. Once the work on the railway ceased thegeneral condition improved considerably. Rations became much better and generaltreatment of prisoners by the Japanese showed a marked improvement. The only work done in Chungkai camp consisted of camp fatigues and we started quite a large gardenunder Japanese supervision. When this garden began to produce vegetables, most ofthe produce went to the Japanese, and if there was any over this was given to the sick,One day a herd of extremely lean cattle arrived and from then on we had a smallration of meat daily, excepting Wednesday, when we had one small fresh fish per man.During this time we managed to contact the Australians and learned from themthat conditions in Burma had been very similar to those prevailing in Thailand.They seemed to be in a better position than we were for clothing and we were able to buy a few articles from them. A party of 200 men from Chungkai under three officers was detailed to build a memorial to prisoners of war and Japanese soldiers who had diedon the construction of the railway; this took the typical Japanese form and was sited on,the river bank near the large steel bridge which crosses the river west of Kanburi. Whenthe memorial was completed it was unveiled by a high ranking Japanese officer withthe usual oriental ceremonial, a detachment of prisoners of war being present. the camp at Chungkai was commanded by Major Outram who had been second in command of the 137 Field Regiment, RA. Although there were British officers in the campsenior to Major Outram and he offered to relinquish his command to them, none ofthem would accept the responsibility. The camp was extremely well run and a credit to the British commander. Life at Chungkai was not without its little incidents and theoccasional beating up still occurred. Three British officers were beaten for smalloffences and two of them suffered from broken jaws and one from a broken arm. OnJanuary 1, 1944, a party of Scottish officers which included myself, decided to celebratenew year by absorbing some extremely raw alcohol which we had previously producedfrom fruit skins, rice, sugar and various other ingredients. We were having quite a party at the end of one of the huts when a Korean guard appeared on the scene andremoved one rather rowdy member of the party to the guard room. The Commandervery wisely decided that as this gentleman was in an extremely ripe condition it was un-likely that he had achievd this without the assistance of friends, so in a few minutes some more guards arrived and collected the remainder of the party. We were all taken to theguard room and lined up at attention. The guard commander apparently had an un-usuai sense of humour for a Korean, because he pushed the end man against the restof us with the result that we all fell down. He then walked along the line saying to eachone of us &quot; Scot soldier ?&quot; If we replied in the affirmative he passed on. There was oneunfortunate Sassenach in the party who said &quot; No English &quot; he immediately receiveda belt on the ear because apparently the guard considered that an Englishman shouldnot be celebrating New Year. A few minutes afterwards we were all dismissed and what might have been an ugly incident finished quite happily. Next day a miserable time was had by all the revellers as this type of alcoholic refreshment was not the best thingfor the system.During January, a party of about 400 fit men and an officer were sent off toNocompation to start the construction of a new hospital camp for the sick men who were suffering from chronic maleria, dysentry and any other ailment which made them of nofurther use as labour. This camp was well laid out and the huts were of weatherboarding with wooden floors; reasonable sanitary arrangements were to be provided and it was understood that the camp would be under the supervision of the Red Crossauthorities. The work was completed by the end of May and we started evacuating the sick of No. 2 and No. 4 groups in parties of 500. Also at this time the Japaneseauthorities held a complete medical inspection of all prisoners of war and about 2,000British prisoners were selected for transfer to Japan.   In this party no officer above
the rank of captain was included; the ratio being one officer to each 150 men. I was in command of this party. We were segregated trom the rest of the troops in the campand were fitted out with one shirt, one pair of shorts, one pair of boots (rubber), onesinglet, one pair of under pants. Eventually after a long wait we were entrainedfor Singapore on the morning of June 7, 1944. It was the original intention to embarkat Bankok but apparently this was found to be impracticable owing to allied bombingactivities. Before we lett we received the news of &quot; D Day &quot;, and as can be wellimagined this gave us a tremendous uplift. Before we left we used to have frequentair raid alarms both day and night and on several occasions we were able to see alliedbombers passing over the camp. This always heartened us considerably. The day before we lett a Japanese newspaper man came to the camp and I was sent for to beinterviewed by him. He asked me lots of stupid questions, one of which was, &quot; Areyou afraid of being sunk by American submarines ?&apos;&apos; He gave me to understand thatthe Americans made a habit of lying in wait for ships carrying British prisoners of warand sinking them, but assured me that as the Japanese ruled the ocean, and as wewould be heavily escorted, we need have no fear. All of which was extremely amusing.1 am afraid the gentleman was under the impression that the best place for me was alunatic asylum owing to some of the frivolous answers which I gave to his questions.We arrived in Singapore after a most uncomfortable four days and we were accom-accommodated at Rifver Valley Road camp. This camp was in an advanced state ofdilapidation, and as the supply of firewood during our stay there was quite inadequateI am afraid that the whole place must have falfen down shortly after we left as wesupplemented our supplies considerably from the buildings. In the next camp therewere about 3,000 Indian troops who had been captured when Singapore fell and whohad been working on the island ever since. Alth ough we were strictly forbidden tohave any contact with these people we managed to speak to them quite a lot and it.was really a pathetic sight to witness their delight at seeing British officers again.There could not be the slightest doubt as to the loyalty of these men, as the Japanese had used every form of persuasion to turn them against us, without success. They hadbeen beaten and on occasions starved in an attempt to make them go over to theJapanese, but still remained loyal.We had an officer of the Gurka Regiment with us and he was able to hold quite a few conversations with the Sepoys, who described to him the methods used by theJapanese in attempting to force them to join the Free Indian Army.   During the earlierdays of our captivity, while we were still in Changi, Sikh guards had been placed overus and British officers had been made to salute them.   We later found out that thesemen had been enlisted mainly from the naval base and other police forces.   While wewere in transit in the camp at Singapore the rations consisted of rice, tapioca root, whichwas almost inedible, and a small quantity of extremely odorous dried fish, and in quantity were quite inadequate.   The health of the men, who were all fit when wearrived in Singapore began to decline rapidly.   We were finally marched down to the docks for embarkation on June 26th.   We were divided into two parties, one of 1,250under my command and the other consisting of 750 under the command of Captain R.Hall, of 118 Field Regiment, RA.   The ship on which my party embarked was the&quot; Hofoku Maru &quot;, a vessel of about 5,000 tons built on the Clyde in 1902.   She wasin a very bad state indeed, the plating on the decks being eaten through by rust in several places, and she did not look as though she had seen any paint since the warbegan.   We were to be accommodated in two holds, one forward and one aft, which meant putting 625 men in each hold.   As we were carrying a cargo of bauxite in thelower parts of the holds only the top section of each hold was available to us.    Iimmediately protested to the Japanese officer in charge about the conditions but despitea lengthy argument we were finally forced to embark.   The crowding in the holds was such that no man could lie down and all had to sit up in a cramped position.   He had,however, promised that once we left the port we would be allowed to sleep a certainnumber of men on the deck.   This helped to ease the congestion a little.   We finally gotunder way in a convoy of eleven ships with an escort of four small destroyers.   Wesailed within sight of land all the way to Miri in British North Borneo, when we stoppedfor re-fuelling.   This port, which is an important oil centre, was crowded with shipping and there were a large number of tankers being loaded with crude oil.   Somethingwent wrong with our engines while we were here and the rest of the convoy, includingthe ship with the 750 British prisoners, sailed without us.   Eventually, after ten days, we put to sea again in a convoy of eleven ships with an escort of four destroyers and&apos; sailedclose to land all the time until we finally reached Manila on 23rd Jury.   We arrived inthe bay about mid-afternoon and next morning went alongside.    Here we unloadedabout a hundred hen coops on to the decks and then pulled out into the bay again and dropped anchor about three miles off shore.   At this time Manila Bay was crowded with japanese shipping of all sorts and transports loaded with Japanese troops were con-tinuously passing through.   As far as we could observe they did not seem to land manyof these troops in Manila.   The ship containing the 750 British prisoners was in thebav when we sailed a few days later.   By now the health of the troops was causing(22736)
us serious concern and I used to spend quite a bit of time on the bridge in appealingto the Japanese tor more reasonable treatment. Although we had four doctors with uswe had practically no medical supplies except a small quantity of quinine. Very soonwe had our first death, which was rapidly followed by others. Our doctors, despite the fact that they did everything humanly possible in attempts to save lives, were unable to cope With the situation. Finally, the Japanese agreed to make some attemptto procure some medical supplies for us and in a tew days two boxes containing these were brought aboard. Out of these supplies we were given a small quantity of vitamininjections and some vitamin pills. The bulk, which was all American Red Cross, was kept by the Japanese for the use of themselves. We also did everything possible to procure better rations for the men but here again met with little success. Daily rationsconsisted of six boxes of rice, one large basket of vegetabfes, and half a bucket of fish,also salt and a spoonful of sugar once every five days. All this between. 1,250 men.Sickness was steadily increasing and the death date became higher. The majority of themen were by now in a very weak state and were suffering so badly from beri beri that many of them could not retain even the small amount of food which they got. Tomake matters worse it was now the rainy season and we had about six weeks&apos; continuousdownpour. As it was quite impossible to cover the holds without suffocating the menwe lived in a state of continuous wetness. There apparently was something seriouslywrong with our engines and they were working continuously on them. The localPhilippinos used to come aboard when they were coaling and from them we gieanedquite a bit of news. They used to bring us the local newspaper, called the &quot; ManilaTribune &quot;. This was printed in English and although it was full of Japanese propa-ganda we were able to form some idea from it of the local conditions. Most of the natives spoke quite a bit of English and we were extremely friendly with them.Eventually, the Japanese, when they saw that we were fraternizing with these people,increased the guards and threatened to shoot any of us seen talking to the natives.After we had been lying in the bay for a few weeks they proceeded to off-load our cargoon to another ship. Three ships came alongside at different times and gangs ofFormosans who were dressed in Japanese uniforms unloaded our cargo of bauxite and quite a large quantity of ingots into them.These Formosans appeared to be in a pretty bad physical condition and were alsoinclined to be friendly towards us. Our men by now were dying daily, and finally wehad reached the rate of five or six deaths per clay. The first man who died had beenburied ashore in a large cemetery on the outskirts of the town, but now all the menwho died were thrown overboard wrapped in rice sacks with a box of bauxite tied onto their feet. We had a padre with us and we were able to give all the men a Christianburial, although the Japanese adopted a most callous attitude towards this and insisted on the bodies going overboard a few minutes after death. By now about half the menwere quite unable to move at all and most of those who could walk about were so weakthat the few who were strong enough to do any work with the sick were rapidly losingstrength through lack of sleep. The holds were in a filthy condition as we had nofacilities for cleaning them and the Japanese made no attempt to help us in any way.The majority of the men were unable to climb out of the holds to use the latrines andthe stench in the holds became unbearable. We appealed to the Japanese to allow usto put at least some of the men ashore, and finally we were allowed to evacuate only50 of the worst cases. These men were taken to a hospital in one of the Americancamps in Manila and we understood that they were being well cared for. By the time we finally sailed from Manila Bay on September 20 over one hundred men had died,including one of our medical officers, Capt. M. G. Braham.During the last few weeks of our stay in Manila Bay there had been quite a numberof air raid alarms and we had moved to dispersal areas on quite a few occasions but sofar had seen no sign of any allied aircraft. We had also heard that the American fleet was somewhere in the vicinity. By this time the men were in such bad shape that theyreally did not seem to care what happened and one man jumped overboard in anattempt to end it all. We managed to rescue him, one of his friends jumping overboardand holding him up until a rope was thrown in, but when we got him on board he lay down and refused to eat and died within a few days. Many of the other men alsoadopted this attitude. We left in a convoy of seven ships at midday on September 21and we were escorted by two small destroyers and two very small escort vessels. at o&apos;clock that night, just as it was getting dark, we sailed into a little bay on the Luzoncoast and anchored for the night. We sailed again at 6 o&apos;clock next morning. TheJapanese were extremely nervous and the guards had been issued with hand grenadesto be thrown into the holds in event of any trouble. The majority of our men had been supplied with lifebelts. At nine o&apos;clock on the morning of September 21st I was downin one of the holds talking to the men when suddenly there was a terrific roar of aburst of machine gun fire. The bullets came rattling along the deck but few of thempenetrated into the hold. I ordered the men to keep under cover and ran up on to thedeck to find out what was happening. I saw that the convoy was being attacked byabout 60 American dive bombers and two of the ships were already sinking.   They now
seemed to be concentrating on our ship and several more planes machine gunned us,completely wrecking the tew lifeboats which we had and killing several people,   lireonly means ot defence which we had was an ancient held gun mounted on a platformastern and alter firing one round the gun crew went overboard.   The first hit on ourship was an aerial torpedo which hit us amidships and lilted us well out of the water.I ran round to the side of the ship, which had been hit, to see what the damage was.I thought that although we appeared to be listing slightly, as the decks were still beingmachine gunned it would not be advisable to bring the men out from the holds justyet.  I ordered them to stand fast and put on their litebelts.   Just then two dive bombersappeared, they headed straight for us and I could see the bombs being released; one 01the bombs fell into the forward hold and exploded causing frightful casualties amongthe men.   The second bomb fell into the aft nold and blew a large hole in the bottom of the ship.   Almost simultaneously another two bombs hit us amidships.   As we now seemed doomed I ordered the men to abandon ship, getting as many of the sick aspossible out of the holds first.   I was still shouting this order when she broke in themiddle and plunged under in a matter of seconds.   I found myself in the water sur-rounded by wreckage of all sorts.   The Korean guards had gone overboard as soon aswe were hit by the first bomb and no attempt was made to interfere with the prisoners in any way.   It had been quite impossible to move any except the few sick men fromthe holds and hundreds of them were drowned like rats in a trap.   It was dreadful to hear the men crying for help which they never received.   When we were in the water,planes dived down and started machine gunning us causing quite a number of casualties.After a few minutes they must have seen that we were white men and the machinegunning stopped.   As far as I could see most of the convoy seemed to have been sunkexcepting one large tanker which had managed to run aground on the beach, whichwas about four miles distant.   None of the escort vessels was hit, although there were many near misses on them.   Soon lifeboats were lowered from these vessels, but they refused to pick up anyone but Japanese survivors.   It had been our intention to kill theJapanese officer in charge of us in the event of anything like this happening but it wasall over so quickly we never had a chance to get to them.   We had, however, succeeded in killing one particularly nasty member of the crew.   As soon as I got to the waterI decided to try to reach the beach and escape into the hills.   I spoke to several of themen who were near me in the water and told them to make for the beach and get intothe jungle, when I would try to find them later.   After being in the water for six hoursI at last approached the beach only to find the Japanese from a nearby garrison therewaiting our arrival.   Fortunately there were large breakers running near the beach andI was able to swim a few yards north of these Japanese and escape into the undergrowth,which was only a few yards from the water&apos;s edge.   I was so exhausted that I am afraidI passed out for a few hours, but fortunately the Japanese did not discover my hidingplace.   I started to make my way inland and ran into a bunch of Philippines, some ofwhom were the local constabulary and were armed with rifles.   They asked me who  was and I told them that I was a British officer and was trying to escape from theJapanese.  At this time I was dressed only in a pair of underpants.  They agreed to helpme although the constabulary were supposedly pro-Japanese.   They took me to one oftheir hiding places in a sugar cane field near the town and promised to bring a Philippinowho had served in the American Army during the battle of Bataan after dark.   Thisman duly arrived accompanied by some friends.    I found that they were all pro-American and had been officers in the Philippino Army.   They took me to one of their houses and gave me some clothing and a good meal, the first one I had had for threeyears.   Much to my disappointment I found that I was unable to do it justice.   later that night I was moved to another house on the outskirts of the town where I stayedfor the next few days.   While I was there quite a number of Philippines who could be trusted came to visit me bringing food and cigarettes.   They asked me if I would forma guerilla band in the district as there was no active organization in that particularplace at the time; although the guerillas were active in many other localities.   The nameof this town was San Narciso in the province of Zambeles.   I agreed to organize a company of guerillas and eventually we enlisted four officers and eighty men.   the names of the officers were Fred Posadas, who was to be second in command, R. E.Aguirre, Tony Pasadas and Attorney Evangelista.   Out of the eighty men we had astrong armed squad of four whose duty it was to procure arms.   A number of the nativeshad collected side arms and rifles during the American retreat and had kept these hiddenfrom the Japanese.   My men knew where quite a number of these were to be found and used to go off at night and threaten the owners until they handed over the arms to us.There were Japanese garrisons in quite a number of the towns around us so we had tobe extremely careful.   I personally only moved about during the hours of darkness.In the meantime I had learned from the chief of the constabulary that eight british soldiers had succeeded in escaping.   I arranged for him to send these men about thirtymiles inland to the foot of the hills where there were no Japanese.   This was done andthe men were hidden away in a small hut in a safe place.   The question of feeding themen was rather difficult at first but eventually we managed to find a man called
Rodriguez who agreed to see to the food supply. After I had been living near the townfor about six weeks a Philippino spy gave me away to the Japanese, fhis caused aquick evacuation to a rice farm about rliree miles out ol the town. A tew nights latersome 01 my men collected this spy, who had previously been responsible tor the arrestand execution of several Philippine patriots, and he was suitably dealt with. shortly after this I set off one night mounted - on a small pony and escorted by jeight aimedPhilippinos to visit the British soldiers who had escaped With me. As it was about30 miles to the place where they were living we did not arrive there until the middle of the  next morning alter having been on the move continuously. As I had not done anyriding since leaving England in 1940 you can imagine that i had to eat standing tor thenext week. The saddles on the horses had been made for a very much smallerposterior than mine and by the time I arrived i was in an acute state of discomfort.1 found the men living in a hut among some trees by the side of the river and they were as comfortable as could be expected under the circumstances. They had been provided with a certain amount of clothing but were unable to find any footwear large enough for them. Food was still proving a bit of a problem and I had brought a bullcart ofvegetables and rice and sugar which i hoped would last them tor at least two weeks.Four sacks of rice which 1 had bought in San Narciso had been waylaid by anotherguerilla outfit and consumed. Although I had words with the captain ol this band1 was not in a position to do much about it. In the part of die country where the menwere living there were no Japanese within 15 miles, and owing to the nature of thecountry it could only be approached by one trail, which could be kept under observation.The men were able to move about freely in the daytime. All the Philippinos in thispart of the country were pro-American and were most helpful to us. Also the Negritoswho lived in the mountains used to come to feed the men, bringing thern small gilts offood and tobacco. After being with them for a week I returned to San Narciso. Thechief purpose of my guerilla company was to procure information regarding the disposi-tion of Japanese garrisons and troop movements in the Zambeles province. Also to observe shipping movement on the coast. By now aircraft from American naval forces were flying over the territory almost daily and one day in particular we had the thrillof seeing nine American fighters shoot down 11 Japanese twin-engined bombers whichwere coming in to land at San Marcelino aerodrome. One of these planes came downin a padi field quite near where I was living. There were n Japanese in the plane, all of them officers. Eight of them were killed and the remaining three slightly injured.From information collected it was ascertained that all of the machines had been carryingpassengers and had no bomb load. In the afternoon some of my men removed twotwin barrel -30 calibre machine guns from the plane, also quite a quantity of ammunition and an excellent map which included the south island ot Japan proper, Formosa andthe whole of Luzon. From this map we gathered that the planes had come from aero-dromes in the south of Formosa and were making for Manila. Unfortunately, shortly after we had removed the machine guns from the plane about a dozen Japanese soldiersappeared and when they found that the guns were missing they threatened to burn the nearest barrio unless the guns were returned immediately. This, of course, had to bedone. We had better luck, however, with a machine &quot;which had come down a bit furtheraway and we were able to secure one twin barrel machine gun from this. Soon after-wards I had a message from an American colonel who was living with the Negritosin the Zarnbeles mountains. I had heard of his presence previously, but as I had been told by the Philippinos that he was not taking any active part in the guerilla organizationI had not bothered to get into touch with him. About this time another Japanese spyhad given information as to my whereabouts and the Japanese were offering &quot;10 bags office for my capture. Fortunately for me one of my men found out about this and Imanaged to get away about an hour before the Japanese party arrived to collect me.Unfortunately, however, they did manage to arrest the three&quot;Philippino officers, Posadas,Aguirre and Evangehsta. By this time I was well on my way towards the mountains,once again on horseback and accompanied bv my armed guard of Philippinos. TheJapanese tied the three Philippinos with their hands behind&quot; their backs and started towork on them m their usual way in an attempt to make them give away mv whereabouts.Unfortunately, Evangehsta broke clown after he had been immersed in a fish pondseveial times and almost drowned and gave the Japanese all die information they wanted. He gave this in the form of a written statement to the Jaoanesc officer and told him all about our company of guerillas, also the fact that I &quot;had gone off to see theAmerican colonel m the hills and was expected back in a few davs. &quot;After he had riventins statement he was apparently overcome with remorse and when his hands &quot;Wereuntied to allow him to sign the statement he snatched up the Japanese officer is revolverand --hot him twice through the head, killing him instantly. He then turned the gun onhimself and shot himself through the head. During this interlude the Japanese soldierswho had been standing on guard ran out of the house and the local mayor who hadbeen forced to accompany the Japanese, was able to snatch the statement&apos;from the table and conceal it on his person. The most amazing thin? about it all was that thestatement apparently had been completely forgotten by the Japanese soldiers and they
never asked tor it again.  It was really the greatest stroke oi good luck that this particularofficer had been killed, as apparently he had a very considerable amount ot iniormationabout the whole ot the guerilla movement in Zambeles and was about to send outpunitive expeditions.   In the usual Japanese lashion he had been Keeping this iniorma-tion to himself, probably so that he got ail the glory lor cleaning up the guerillas and,of course, it ail died with him.  The next day the Japanese arrested the families, includingthe children, of all the Phiiippinos concerned ana threw them into prison.   For some reason best known to themselves they made the wife of Evangelista sign a statement tothe effect that her husband had been killed by the Japanese guards while attempting to escape.   In the meantime, the other two officers were being tortured in an attempt tomake them talk. They told the Japanese that they knew me and that I had come to themfor help some time before in a very weak condition; they said that they had given mesome food and sent me away as they felt sorry for me but were afraid to give me shelter.Despite everthing, they did not give me away and finally after two week&apos;s imprisonmentthey were all set free, but were told that they must live in future in the provincialcapital, a town called Iva, and must report to the Japanese garrison there daily.   Duringail this time I had been living in the hills with the American colonel.   When I first, methim I was escorted to his hideout by a band of Negritos, some of whom were armed with rifles and some with bows and arrows.   Before we proceeded to the hideout, whichwas about 2,000 feet up the steep mountain, covered in jungle and only approachableby one narrow trail, they disarmed me.   By the time we reached the top ot the hill wewere wringing wet with perspiration.  The Negritos remained as cool as they were whenthey started off.   I found the colonel very comfortably housed in a small hut well hiddenaway among banana trees and quite impossible to find without the aid of a guide.   TheJapanese had already on one occasion tried to find the hideout without success.   Hiscooking was done for him by a Philippino soldier who had been his constant companionfor two years.   I found the gentleman to be in not too good a state, either mentally orphysically.   He started our conversation by telling me that as I was a British officer hewould prefer me to discontinue my command of the guerilla company in San Narcisoand that it should be handed over to one of the Philippino officers.   He had apparentlydecided to take an active part in guerilla activities and had made himself commander of all Luzon.   He had formed a staff consisting of many American officers who were running loose around the island and used to send out orders, employing Negrito runners.Just before I arrived he had been able to secure a short wave receiving set and it had become my job while I remained with him to listen in to the news, usually from san francisco, and take it down for distribution.   After I had been there for a couple of weeks one of his officers arrived from Pampanga and we finally persuaded him that itwas now safe to leave the mountains and go down into the foot of the hills where hewould be better able to establish a headquarters with more control.   Eventually, wemoved out to a new site near the barrio of Cynamar and within a few hundred yards of where my men were living.   We lived in a small house which belonged to TentientVernan De La Creuz.   From here I was in a position to see my men each day.   Theonly trouble about this area was that there was a lot of malaria and as my men and myself had already had a considerable amount of malaria whilst in Thailand we found it very trying.   The men in particular were continuously getting the fever, and as wewere not able to attain the necessaty medicines the health was causing me quite a lot of concern.   One of them who had been badly beaten about the head by the Japanese inThailand became very ill and eventually died after having been in a coma for eight days.   This was on November 21st.   I gave him a Christian burial as well as I could,and some of the guerillas fired a volley over the grave.   The health of the remainder of the men was getting worse and after trying to get a doctor to visit them from one ofthe towns in Zambeles one of the American officers told me that he knew a doctor overin Pampanga who was a member of the guerilla force and gave me a letter to himordering him to come over and see the men.   I was supplied with a guide and set offfor Pampanga early one morning.   This involved a two day journey over three rangesof mountains and was extremely hard going.   I was met on the other side by a fresh lot of guides who took me to where another American officer was living in the barrio ofNatividad near the town of Qua Gua.   He was able to help me to procure a large supplyof drugs which the doctor considered would be necessarv and eventually after about aweek we set out on the return journey.   In Pampanga the guerillas were&quot; extremely wellorganized and it was possible to move about more freely at night, although there were many Japanese garrisons in this district.  We used to have men in each barrio who wouldcontact us and let us know if the district was clear of Japanese and safe to move about in.In one town, San Fernando, there was a Japanese garrison of about loco, and weused frequently to pass very close to one of their guard posts without ever being suspectedby the Japanese sentries. One evening an American officer who had gone to the townto meet one of the guerilla leaders, stepped out of a bull cart and found himself faceto face with a Japanese soldier. They stared at one another for a split second then theJapanese ran one way and the American the other. The reason for this suddendisappearance of the Japanese was that he was unarmed and the American had a 45
hanging from his waist. We never moved about any time without our side arms. Duringthe time I spent in Pampanga I lived in a house on the outskirts of the barrio. This housebelonged to three extremely plump sisters who had been harbouring Americans all thetime since the tail of Manila. Tiiey were completely unafraid of the Japanese, andalthough their house had been searched on several occasions they Had so far managed to keep clear of trouble. Also living in this district was the ex-Governor ol me province of Masbate, Dr. Pecson. The doctor was one ox the lew governors who had persistentlyrefused to co-operate with the Japanese, and he had spent some considerable tune in prison. When he was finally released he was forbidden to go back to his province onpain of death. He was doing extremely good work among the natives in the district,although he had to be constantly on his guard and had to go into hiding whenever any japanese appeared in the district. The Americans had by now practically cleared Leyteand were making daily raids on the aerodrome in Luzon. In the district where I waswe were within twelve miles of Clark Field, which is the largest aerodrome in Luzon,and there was also a string of smaller air strips all within a ten mile radius. Clark Fieldwas bombed almost daily by heavy bombers and the smaller air strips were straffedalmost continuously. A lot of this straffing was anything but accurate, and it paid totake cover whenever allied aircraft were sighted. The Japanese in the district musthave got wind of our presence, as they started to raid the nearby barrios, forcing us toget out of the house and hide in the padi fields during daylight hours. On one occasionthey actually got within a hundred yards of our hiding place, but fortunately theyturned away in another direction.In the meantime, I had sent the Philippine doctor with an American pilot over toZambeles with the medical supplies and orders to proceed direct to my men and give them treatment immediately. I was delayed with an abscess on my leg and an attack of malaria which made it quite impossible for me to travel. We had been sending outpatrols to collect American pilots who had been shot down during the raids on the airfields and in all we were able to bring in 12 officers and men whom we supplied withguides and sent over to the American colonehs headquarters in Zambeles. AnyAmerican pilot to be caught by the Japanese was immediately bayoneted. By thefirst week in January the Americans gained complete air superiority and for some timenow there had been no opposition from the Japanese. Japanese troop movements were now going on on a fairly large scale. Considerable numbers of troops were moved bothby M.T. and on foot going north; presumably in anticipation of an American landing in the gulf of Lingayen. Quite a number of tanks and heavy guns were included inthis move. There appeared to be a shortage of food and each town that we stoppedat they were in a habit of confiscating all the rice, chickens and pigs which they could find. They were also commandeering bull carts to transport these supplies. ThePhilippinos did their best to hide the rice and live stock. The fact that the Japanese had begun to make house to house searches forced us to move out of the district. They were taking reprisals against the natives, and every time Japanese soldiers approached abarrio the natives used to run into the padi fields and hide. This annoyed the japanese and they began to use machine guns. Many natives were killed in this way. the americans were now dropping pamphlets warning the natives to keep away from the&apos;main roads as they were bombing bridges and straffing any transport seen moving onthe roads. When I was fit again I moved off, accompanied by an American officer andsome native guides, across the mountains to Zambeles.We left Natfvidad at dusk and had an uneventful journey to Dampe in the foot-hills, apart from having to lie low before crossing the national highway to allow acolumn of Japanese tanks to pass. We were due to move off from Dampe at 6 o&apos;clock.the next morning to make a crossing of the mountains. Just before we set off an american Major arrived on horseback to tell us that allied forces had landed onLuzon the previous day. This, of course, was terrific news and we set off forZambeles in high spirits. We spent one night in the mountains building a large fire and sleeping on the ground. A fire is necessary in the hills during the night as it becomes extremely cold. We arrived at Zambeles the following morning and I foundthat the doctor had already been at work and that the health of the men was con-siderably improved. The doctor was doing a fine job and soon had all the men ontheir feet again. As it was harvest we were able to get plenty of rice and to tradethis for other foodstuffs. Up till now we had been using Japanese war note but withthe American landing this had become practically valueless. For the past monthwe had been in contact with South West Pacific H.Q., by radio. The Americans had sent in nine transmitting and receiving sets complete with trained Philippino operators,during the latter part of November. These had been landed from a submarine onthe coast of Tynabas but of course, it had taken some considerable time to get the communications ready for use. There was one master station in the mountains out-side Manilla which we christened Victory Hill. A sub-station had been allottedcertain fixed times for sending and receiving messages which were relayed by the master station at S.W.P. HQ. We were able to get all the intelligence informationout by this means.   On the morning of January 11, we received a message from General
McArthur&apos;s H.Q. telling us that immediately on receipt of this message we must startsabotage upon the Japanese. This was done immediately. In this connection, I have one criticism to make of the American ColonePs policy. I argued with his staff thatsome of the raids must be led by white officers as the Philippines were not reliable,unless they had a white man in command. The American H.Q., however, decided against this policy with the results that we received many reports of guerilla activities,and a lot of misleading information about results obtained in various assignmentswhich had been given to the different guerilla companies. Finally, two of the Americanflying officers and myself went down to San Marcelina to check up on the air stripwhich the guerillas were supposed to have captured and be holding. When we arrived in the vicinity of the airstrip accompanied by the Philippino captain who was supposed to have been in charge of the operation, we had the impression that this gentlemenwas becoming extremely nervous. This was not surprising, as we found no Philippinowhatever guarding the aerodrome, although fortunately, the Japanese had completelyevacuated. In my opinion they had done this quite on their own accord and not becauseof any attack made by this particular guerilla company. We scouted around the perimeter of the airfield and when we discovered that there were no Japanese, wentout on to the airstrip to see if we could report it fit for use by American aircraft. we found that the Japanese had dug large numbers of holes all over the aerodrome andhad planted bombs varying in size from 25 to 250 kilos, upside down in these holes.I did not like the look of the fuses and was not prepared to touch them without someexpert advice, so I ordered one of the young American flyers to go back to H.Q. and give a verbal report on the situation. This he did, much to the displeasure of thePhilippino guerilla captain who received a terrific rocket from the American Colonel,and was removed from his command. The airman arrived back that evening withorders that the airstrip had got to be cleared, so we procured a long length of ropeand fastened it to one of the bombs and started to pull. Much to our relief the bombicame out of the hole without anything nasty happening. The bombs were pulled wellaway from the airstrip and by the erfd of the day we were able to declare it fit foruse. During the morning, two American B 25 aircraft flew very low overhead andwaved to us as they passed. We saw that they were flying straight for H.O. whichwas about 20 miles further inland and learned later that they had dropped arms andammunition and also food on the site which we had previously arranged by radio.That evening I received information that American Naval P.T.Bs. were patrolling thecoast three miles off shore. I decided to go down there that night with an Americanofficer in an attempt to contact them. I did not take my men with me as we decidedthat is was risky and we did not want to have too many people there. We lit threelarge bamboo fires on the beach and we had procured a headlamp and a six volt carbattery, each to signal to the craft when they came along. The nearest japanese troops were about 10 miles down the coast but there was a headland between them andthe spot on the beach which we were going to use. We started the vigil at about o&apos;clock and in the morning we heard what sounded like aircraft approaching, but asthe sound came nearer we realised that it was the patrol. We started flashing the lampand to our joy we heard engines cut out and two boats started to make for the shore. They signalled to us asking us who we were, and the Philippino who was workingthe lamp and who had been a -signaller in the American Army replied suitably. they then signalled to us to come out and we boarded the rowing boat and rowed out to-wards them. They kept us covered as we approached; when they were within hailingdistance they called for us to come aboard. They threw a net over the side. I was soexcited that when I made a leap for it I went through one of the squares and was lefthanging upside clown with my head almost in the water. When we finally got aboardwe had a wonderful reception from the crew. I felt extremely sorry for the Americanofficer who was unable to accompany us as he was on the H.Q. staff, and had to returnthere to report to the Colonel. After we had handed over all the information hebid me farewell and returned to the beach while we pushed off for Lingayan Gulf tojoin the American Fleet. After going flat out all through the night we finally ap-proached the gulf ^it dawn and were met by an air patrol. We went to the mothership of the M.T.B. squad and arrived there at about 9 o&apos;clock in the morning. I wastaken aboard the ship and went straight down to breakfast. 1 must have looked asorry sight as I was dressed in filthy old clothes and had not had a shave for about aweek. I felt that everyone was saying &quot; What the Hell is this arrived among us?&quot;After breakfast I was taken down to the Q Stores and given a complete kit; I thenhad a hot bath and a shave after which I felt quite a respectable citizen again forthe first time in three years. I was then taken to the intelligence room and myinterrogation started. I was treated with the utmost courtesy and consideration bythe American Navy and during the time I spent with them I have nothing butpraise for their organisation. That night I slept between clean sheets on a com-comfortable bed for the first time since I had been captured. I spent two days on this H.Q.ship and on the third, went ashore to be interrogated by Army H.Q..    When we
reached the shore after an adventurous journey through the surf, I breathed a sighof relief.   We found that the Army H.O. had moved the day before to a new locationabout 50 miles south.   I had previously arranged that a message be sent to my menby an American officer who had come&quot; aboard the American M.T.B., telling them tobe on the beach the following night and the Navy had promised to pick them up. ^ Weflew down the coast at about 3,000 feet and I had a wonderful view of the territorywhere I had spent the last four months.   After 3-I hours we finally landed at a newlycaptured airstrip at Mindora.   A few clays before this had been severely shelled by someJapanese navel forces which had managed to slip through the American blockade,and had inflicted quite severe damage on the air strip and on aircraft on the ground.It was now in use and was quite a large operational base.   During the half hour thatwe stopped there bombers and fighters were taking off almost continuously.   We thenflew on to Leyte, and landed on the famous Talc Boan strip.   This ran right along theedge of the beach within two yards of the sea.   Here one saw abundant signs of afierce battle which had taken place round the aerodrome which had originally been built by the Japanese.   It had suffered many severe aerial attacks and there were largenumbers of derelict planes which had been pulled off the airstrip on to the beach.Small bands of Japanese were still being mopped up all over the island and the con-tinuous state of alertness existed.   I was there for two nights and both nights a small number of Japanese planes came over and dropped bombs.      Very little damage was done.   It was here that I made my first contact with Imperial troops.   I wastaken to an Australian officer whose job it was to look after any British or Australianprisoners who had been liberated or who had escaped.   I was his first customer, andjudging from my experience with this officer I feel very sure that any other prisonerwho passes through his hands will be extremely well looked after.    After we haddinedwe retired to his tent and to my great jo\&apos; he presented a genuine bottle of Scotchwhiskey and we celebrated in the customary manner.   The next morning I was in-terrogated once again by both the American and Australian Army authorities. I thenmet the Australian General and his staff and found them most delightful people.   Therewas also a British Colonel and his staff officer in this camp.   I had a slight attack ofmalaria and had to rest in Leyte for a couple of days before proceeding. A few days laterI reported at Talc Boan airstrip at 3 0&apos;clock in the morning to proceed to Hollandia.I was to fly down in a four engined Douglas.   On the air strip the Americans had intheir extremely modest manner erected a large sign board on which was inscribed in large letters &quot; The busiest airport in the world &quot;.    I was amused.   While we werewaiting for our plane to come in, a flight was taking off and another lot were coming in; one of the fellows in the air decided that it was his turn to land, just as some ofthe other fellows were coming down the strip flat out to take off.   In the resultingconfusion five large bombers crashed into one another and immediately burst intoflames.   This cost the lives of practically all the crews and there was complete chaos fora time.   Our take off was delayed considerably by this unfortunate accident and it was1030 before we were finally ready to go.   There were sixty passengers in the planeand as we taxied down to the end of the strip everyone was under considerablestrain.   The expression on their faces when we finally made the run down and weresafely airborne was one of tense relief.    After an uneventful journey we toucheddown at Hollandia at 1900 hours, just as it was getting dark.   The airstrip here isone of the best in the S.W. Pacific and is now used mainly by transport planes.   I wasmet here by a British Major of the R.E.&apos;s, who was attached to the A.I.F. and theAustralian Camp Commandant.   I was very warmly welcomed by them and taken tothe Australian Advanced H.Q.   After a bath and1 a change of clothing, provided bythe Major, I had my first really civilized meal in three years.   We then proceeded to theMajoLs tent and he produced a bottle of whiskey, which he had carried with himall the way from Inverness.   He had been keeping this bottle to celebrate the down-fall of Hitler, but decided that the advent of a fellow Scot under the circumstancesmerited the celebration.   Half the bottle was to be used for this and the remaindercould be dealt with when Mr. Shicklegruber was down for the count.   I found thatthe Major was like myself, a Rugby enthusiast, and that we had many mutual acquaint-ances.   This caused us to yarn far into the night and almost resulted in the confiscationof -Mr. HitleLs share of the whiskey.   We managed to resist the temptation and had some Australian gin instead.   Unfortunately, the next morning I was down with anotherattack of malaria, and this put me out of action for three days.   While I was atHollandia I had the pleasure of meeting several of the Australian Brigadiers, alsoa British Colonel who had been with the Malaya campaign in Singapore.   I could have flown direct from here to America but was persuaded bv the Australian staff to go down to Sydney and give the Australian authorities the &quot;dope on the situationin Thailand on the promise that they would arrange to have me flown home from there.We took off for Brisbane at 6 o&apos;clock; we arrived in Darwin; all the passengerswondered why we had gone so far out of our way and we discovered that it was because a friend of the pilot had turned up at the last moment wanting to go to
Darwin, and the pilot had obliged. Naturally, we were all rather cross about this asit meant at least an extra ten hours flying and the weather was far from good. We hada meal in the so called flying officers mess, consisting of an egg and bacon, followed bytinned pears, all served on the same plate. For this they charged us two shillings andsixpence. After a long search for the refuelling officer we finally got the machinefilled up again and took off again at 3 p.m. The weather by now had closed inconsiderably and we had a most uncomfortable journey clown to Brisbane. We flewthrough some very bad electrical storms and finally having missed the aerodrome byabout twenty miles, finally touched down at two o&apos;clock in the morning, much to therelief of everyone. The Australian authorities were expecting my arrival and were there to meet me with transport. I was taken straight to 112 B.G.H. at GreenSlopes, where I was admitted into hospital at 3 a.m. When I got to the officers&apos;ward I found that I had known the brother-in-law of the sister on night duty, and thereafter I could do no wrong. The hospital authorities were extremely good and mystay in this hospital was very pleasant. I had many long talks with Australian officers who had been with the British Eighth Army in Lybia,and was most grateful to know thatthey had the highest admiration for all British soldiers. Having been so long with ourAmerican allies I had begun to doubt whether the old country was doing anythingwhatever in this war, apart from providing comforts for the American soldiers inEngland. Also reading the Australian newspapers gave one the same impression. I also met in the hospital a British sailor who had been on an assault ship in the landing on Sicily and Italy and also on D Day, and was extremely gratified to hear of the superior quality of the British fighting men. After I had been in the hospital for afew days my men arrived by sea from the North and were also accommodated atGreen Slopes Hospital. We were delighted to see one another again and I was pleased to see that the men were looking much fitter. The American Navy had kept theirpromise and had picked the men up the night before I got out. I stayed in hospitalat Brisbane for about three weeks awaiting, as I thought, an air passage to England.Eventually I was sent by train to Sydney where I lived in the Staff Corps Mess forten days. Once again Australian hospitality was in its highest form. Finally Iembarked on the transport J 3 where my men joined me once again and we are now en route for England.
