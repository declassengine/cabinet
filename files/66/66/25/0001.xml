THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted, for the Cabinet.   June 1945.Copy No. t *iCABINET.BRABAZON I TYPE CIVIL AIRCRAFT : PROPOSED EXTENSION OFFILTON (BRISTOL) AIRFIELD.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.ON the 30th January, 1945,, my predecessor submitted to the Lord presidents committee a memorandum (L.P. (45) 25) detailing the facilities which would need to be provided at Filton Airfield, Bristol, to enable the two prototypes ofthe large multi-enginecl civil landplane being built by the Bristol aeroplane company to be flown away. This memorandum explained that neither theDefence Acts nor the Air Navigation Act, 1936, could be used for the acquisitionof the necessary land, and sought the authority of the Lord Presidents Committeefor the preparation of a Government &quot; hybrid &quot; Bill for its compulsory acquisition.2. Following the Committee&apos;s consideration of this memorandum, the thenLord President submitted to the War Cabinet a memorandum (W.P. (45) 198)detailing the arguments for this procedure and concluding with four recom-mendations which may be summarised as follows : (i) The extension of the Filton Airfield should be approved and a &apos;&apos; hybrid &apos;&apos;Bill promoted for the purpose.(ii) Consideration should be given to the possibility of building, not onlythese prototypes and production models of this type, but also similaraircraft designed by other manufacturers, at airfields (includingFilton) alreadv nrovided with lone- runwavs.(iii) If recommendation (ii) is practicable, the other manufacturers of heavyaircraft should be warned that they can hope to obtain orders forsuch aircraft only if they establish themselves in the neighbourhoodof certain specified airfields.(iv) The use of Filton Airfield as a civil airport also should be considered on the return of the Minister of Civil Aviation.3. I suggest that consideration of recommendations (ii) and (iii) should be deferred until it is possible to relate them to the wider review of airfield require-ments which is being made by the Chiefs of Staff and by the ad hoc committeecontemplated in the Prime Ministers memorandum W.P. (45) 110.4. As regards recommendation (i), I am anxious for an early decision. Ifthe prototypes are to be built at Filton, it will be necessary not only to constructthe runway from which to fly them, but also to provide a large assembly shed fortheir erection. This shed will be built on land belonging to the Bristol aeroplane company and work can be begun as soon as the decision to build has been taken.It is urgent that it should be so begun, as otherwise the completion of the proto-types will be delayed, with a consequent set-back in the first British aircraftlikely to be able to operate a non-stop service to New York.5. As regards recommendation (iv) in W.P. (45) 198, namely that thepossible use of Filton as a civil airport should be further considered, the situationis that the Airport Committee of the Bristol Corporation has unofficiallyintimated that it favours the proposal subject, however, to receiving assurances from the Minister of Civil Aviation of a satisfactory subsidy. I hope that adecision in favour of using Filton for this purpose may be taken, since it wouldSECRET.CP. (45) 25.8th June, 1945.[30037]
clearly economise effort and land if the extensive airfield which must be created for the Brabazon aircraft were also available as the Bristol Civil Airport. Ifit were possible in the coming months to reach agreement with the BristolCorporation in this sense, not only would the financial burden which otherwisemust fall upon the Exchequer be reduced, but it might be practicable to proceed by private Bill promoted by the Corporation a course likely to be less contentiousthan the &quot; hybrid &quot; Bill previously contemplated.6. It should be mentioned that, although the memorandum submitted to theLord Presidents Committee, and that submitted by the former Lord president to the War Cabinet, state that it will be necessary to acquire for the purpose ofthe runway strip an area of 180 acres, I am advised, after a fuller survey ofthe ground than was possible when these memoranda were drafted, that it willactually be necessary to acquire about 700 acres. The runway requires 180 acres and this area happens to include the farm buildings serving the whole area.The balance of the area, 520 acres, must be acquired to avoid heavy claims for rebuilding or for severance; it consists of farm land which need not be taken out of cultivation and would be allocated to other farms through the war agricultural Executive Committee.7.   I accordingly recommend for approval (a) that the Filton airfield be extended as necessary to enable the Brabazon Iprototypes to be flown away;(&amp;) that consideration be given to using the airfield so extended as the bristol Civil Airport; and(c) that appropriate legislation either by &quot;hybrid &quot; Bill promoted by theGovernment or by Private Bill promoted by the Bristol corporation should be introduced to enable the necessary land&apos;to be acquired.E.
