Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 43.20th June, 1945.CABINET.STREET LIGHTING.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.IN view of the fact that the restoration of full street lighting is due to commence on the 15th July, I must call the attention of my colleagues to the seriousness of the coal stock position at gas works.2. Even by the maintenance of maximum water gas production during the summer months (with the consequent reduction in the amount of coke availableto domestic consumers) and a diversion of 30,000 tons of house coal per week from the impoverished domestic market to gas works, it will only be possibleto build up stocks of coal at gas works to 4-5 weeks by the end of October -ascompared with 6 - 3 weeks at the end of October last year.3. At their meeting on the 12th April, 1945,* the War Cabinet approved the proposal of the then Home Secretary that lighting authorities should be instructed to prepare for the restoration of full street lighting at the end ofBritish Double Summer Time.4. The restoration of gas street lighting causes me particular concern inview of the facts I have set out above. It will require approximately 750,000additional tons of gas coal in the present coal year. This clearly will make iteven more difficult to maintain full gas supplies to domestic consumers and to industry during the coming winter, as the extra gas coal required will be equivalent to about 1-i winter weeks total gas coal consumption.5. In any case, the waste involved if the lamps are allowed to remain on in daylight seems to me wholly indefensible. Apart from the actual waste of gascoal there is, in addition, a psychological factor both with gas and electric street lighting to be taken into account. We already get plenty of public complaints about lights left on in daylight, and if street lamps, gas or electric, are left on.in various places at full strength, it will make fuel economy appeals futile.6. I have ascertained that approximately 3,400 men are required to fit and maintain the lamps so as to ensure that they only operate during the hours ofdarkness. The Minister of Labour and National Service informs me that it isnot possible to secure this extra labour, over and above the labour already urgentlywanted for essential purposes in the two industries, by the 15th July.7. I feel compelled, therefore, both in view of the labour and coal supplyproblems, as well as of the fuel economy drive, to ask my colleagues to consider this situation once more and, at the least, to authorise the issue of instructionsto local authorities that full street lighting, whether gas or electric, may onlybe restored where and when arrangements can be made to keep it extinguishedduring; daylight hours.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,20th June, 1945.* W. M. (45) 42nd Conclusions, Minnie 1.[30098
