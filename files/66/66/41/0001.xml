Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 41.18th June, 1945.CABINET.OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSAL OF  GERMAN WAR MATERIAL  INRELATION TO REPARATION.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Introduction.THE Yalta Protocol on reparation provided that reparation in kind shouldbe exacted from Germany in three forms, one of which was the removal within two years from the surrender of Germany or the cessation of organised resistance,from the national wealth of Germany of equipment, machine tools, ships, rolling-stock, German investments abroad, shares in industrial, transport and other-enterprises in Germany, &amp;c. these removals being carried out generally for thepurpose of destroying the war potential of Germany.2. In August 1944 a paper (E.A.C. (44) 23) was submitted to the european advisory Commission setting out the British proposals in regard to the Owner-ship and Disposal of German war material. This paper, which has not yet beendiscussed, recommended that all war material which fell into the hands of theAllies after surrender should be the property of the United Nations, but thatany war material captured during the course of hostilities should be the propertyof the Ally whose forces had effected capture. The basis for this distinction wasthat, in international law, war material taken during hostilities is booty, the ownership of which rests in the military commander by whose forces it has been captured. The Manual of Military Law, basing itself on Article 53 of the HagueLand Warfare Rules, defines booty in the following terms : Cash, specie, funds and realisable securities which are strictly theproperty of the State, and all property directly susceptible to military use.such as means of transport, appliances for the communication of news, depotsof arms, stores and supplies.&quot;3. E.A.C. (44)23 attached a list of goods to be considered as war materialso widely drawn as to be difficult to justify as coming within the above legaldefinition. The list covered not only arms and equipment but the majority ofthose items listed in the Yalta Protocol which relate to Germany&apos;s capital equip-ment, including &quot; machinery, plant .... designed or adapted for the purpose of inspection, experiment, development, manufacture or testing of war material.&quot;4. Only a very small part of Germany was unoccupied at the time of surrender and the effect of the proposals in E. A.O. (44) 23. if adhered to, would beto exclude from reparation deliveries the bulk of German industrial plant andequipment including most of the machinery scheduled for elimination under what-ever programme of industrial disarmament may be agreed.5. At American insistence the Combined Chiefs of Staff have, however,adopted a different principle and directed that all captured and surrendered warmaterial in Germany and Austria (except what is required for purposes of intelli-gence and research and by the Tbeatre Commander) which, at the cessation ofhostilities, had not been prepared for shipment to meet a pre-assignment by theLondon Munitions Assignment Board should be regarded as the property of theUnited Nations as a whole and would therefore presumably be available for reparations.[30084]Copy No./
6. In their actions in the satellite countries the Russians have shown thatthey attach great importance to booty and give it a wide definition, and, by acting on this, they have taken substantial quantities of material, including industrialplant, in addition to whatever may be owing to them under reparation arrange-ments proper.Discussion of Alternative Courses.7. The Economic and Industrial Planning Staff recently reconsidered this problem in the light of the Yalta Protocol, and, with a view to reconciling the differences between the British and American policies and safeguarding our-selves from the Russians taking as booty the plant and equipment found in theirown zone and also claiming a large share of that found in the remainder ofGermany as reparations, submitted the following recommendations&apos;:  (a) We should draw up and agree with the Russians a selected list of items of war material which can be retained without accountability. TheRussian Government on the one hand and the British and american governments on the other should regard as their property all warmaterial so listed in the hands of the forces under their control.This list should as far as possible be based on the categories andclassifications of the German vocabulary of army, air and naval stores.If the Russians insisted on an extension of the list the extensionwould apply to property which had fallen into the hands of the Anglo-American forces just as much as to property falling into the handsof the Russian forces.(b) Material not included in the list should be treated as available for reparation and account for it should be rendered to the united nations.(c) Allocations of material contained in the list referred to in (a) above would be made to the other European Allies in the same way as atpresent.(d) Captured merchant ships should be considered outside the reparationpool. Surrendered merchant ships should be available for the repara-tion pool. Without prejudice to ultimate title both categories of ships should be put into use as rapidly as possible.8. The paper by the Economic and Industrial Planning Staff was consideredby the Official Committee on Armistice Terms and Civil Administration on the8th June, but in view7 of the questions of high policy involved they were unableto reach a decision whether its recommendations or those in E.A.C. (44) 23 referredto in paragraph 1 above should be adopted. In the course of their discussion,however, the following points were made :  (a) It was unlikely that the Russians would adhere rigidly to an agreedlist, and there was therefore the danger that they would retain withoutaccountability reparation goods taken from their own zone and stillclaim as reparations a substantial share of similar goods in ourzone.(b) The greater part of Germany and consequently of Germany&apos;s warmaterial and war potential had been captured and was at presentin territory occupied by forces under the command of S.C.A.E.F. Inthese circumstances the probability was that the Russians wouldrequire more material from the area under our control than we shouldwant from theirs, and the policy recommended in E.A.C. (44)23 put us in a strong bargaining position.(c) It had been decided to defer consideration of the Russian claim to apart of German naval and merchant shipping until the Three-power meeting; it therefore seemed desirable similarly to postpone a decisionon war material. It should be noted that the great majority of german naval and merchant shipping did not come into our hands until afterthe surrender.(d) From the military point of view there appeared to be little to choose between the two schemes since the list proposed by E.I.P.S. could bedrawn up to include military equipment required for the japanese war and other equipment and war material which we desired to destroy.
Summary.9.   The position can be summarised as follows : - &apos;(a) In August 1944 we proposed that a broad category of material captured&apos;by the forces of an Ally before the general surrender (and in fact most&apos;material was so captured) should belong to that Ally. Under this themajority would be at Anglo-American disposal since it was captured by the Anglo-American forces, though an early withdrawal into the agreed zones of occupation would reduce the advantage. This proposal has not yet been discussed by the E.A.C.(b) In February 1945 we agreed in the Yalta Protocol that a large partof this material should be taken as reparation and allocated betweenthe Allies in the agreed percentages. Subsequently we found that theRussian practice in the Satellite countries is to take as &apos;&apos; booty &apos;&apos; or&quot; trophies &quot; any material which they have not already demanded asreparation. Moreover, the Russians are stripping their zone likelocusts and forbid us to enter it. There is thus an evident danger that the Russians will claim deliveries from our zone while refusingus deliveries from their zone and will take a great deal of material from their zone as&apos; booty, and not as reparation, so as not to countit as part of their agreed.share of reparation.(c) The Cabinet CM. (45) 7th. Conclusions &quot;endorsed the recommenda-tion made in paragraph 4 of Annex II of CP. (45) 16 that the reparations Conference should be invited to adopt a narrow definition of &apos; booty.&quot; &quot; But the arguments for and against this view had notat that time been submitted to the Cabinet, and the recommendation was based only on the obvious undesirability of Germany being-subjected to arbitrary and indefinite demands under the rubric of&quot;booty&quot; over and above the agreed demands under the rubric of&quot; reparation.&quot;Recommendations.10. We cannot simply ignore the Yalta Protocol, especially as the americans would probably not support us in doing so and have never approved ourdistinction between captured and surrendered material. It is suggested, therefore,that our Reparation Delegation should not commit themselves to any view asto the demarcation between reparation deliveries and booty. They should seek toascertain whether the Russians themselves propose a wide definition of booty(such as they have adopted in Roumania and Hungary) and whether they envisagea genuine Four-Power control of Germany such as would admit, for example,of an inspection and valuation by a Four-Power team of all deliveries past andfuture. In the light of this and of what happens at the Three-Power Conference,the Delegation should later seek instructions whether it will be the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to advocate (i) a very wide interpretation of booty which would mean that the Russianson the one hand and ourselves and the Americans jointly on the otherdispose of the material in their own zones and are not accountable to anyone else for it, or(ii) a narrow interpretation of booty which would mean that the russians are accountable for what they have taken and will take from theirzone and allow us to inspect their zone for ourselves.11. Even if the major Powers treat material taken in their own fields of operations, for inter-allied allocation purposes, as booty and not as reparation,and thus retain the right to dispose of it as they wish, it would be sensible to creditits value to Germany in the reparation settlement in so far as it has any economic value for example, to include the value of factories while excluding any value for artillery and tanks (in the Treaty of Versailles Armistice deliveries werecredited to the reparation total). We shall certainly be pressed to agree to anamount of reparation larger than we think practicable, and therefore it would help to include material taken as booty in the final reparation settlement.12. The decision to withdraw from that part of the Russian zone which isnow occupied by British and American forces affects the position, whichever ofthe two schemes is adopted. Although some small items of particular interest or value (such as the gold found at Merkers) have already been moved from thearea into Western Germany, most will have to be left behind; this applies parti-cularly to industrial war material.   Under any arrangement, the Russians will
probably remove what they want of this&apos;. If a wide dellniti.ii of bobty is adopted,they will take more, as booty, of what, has in fact been captured by the Anglo-American forces. If a narrow definition is adopted, they will be accountable to us for more of what they take as reparation, and we have at least a theoreticalright to claim a share for ourselves. The United Kingdom delegation at Moscowmight attempt to establish that, as the Russians captured nothing in operations in this area, they should account for everything they take from it as reparation,on the ground that, if it is booty, it can only be American or British booty; butit would be difficult to enforce such a distinction, and I would not suggest thatthey should insist on it to the last.13. In any case we should take care to see that we exclude from reparationsand retain as booty, with the right of disposal or destruction, all military material which we do not wish to be dealt with by quadripartite agreement. &apos;14. The question of the treatment of ships under reparations should be deferred for consideration at the Three-Power Conference.Conclusion.15. To sum up I ask my colleagues to agree that the line to be taken by our Delegation to the Moscow Reparation Commission should be as follows :  (i) They should not commit themselves at the outset of the Moscow discus-sions to any view regarding the demarcation between reparation deliveries and booty;(ii) they should seek to ascertain the Russian proposals on this matter andsatisfy themselves that the Russians would give all facilities forinsuring that goods ranking as reparation deliveries are properlyaccounted, for;(iii) in the light of (ii) and of what transpires at the forthcoming Three-Power Conference they should seek instructions whether to advocatea wride or narrow definition of booty;(iv) whatever definition of booty is eventually agreed the value of the materialtaken under it should be credited to Germany in the reparation settle-ment, without prejudice to the right of the niajor Powers to dispose of&quot;the booty which they have taken as they think fit;(v) if possible, the Russians should be got to agree that all material whichthey may take from the part of the Russian zone which was firstoccupied by the American and British forces, whatever its nature,should count as reparation;(vi) the booty definition must be drawn up in such a way as to give full rights to dispose of or destroy all military material which we do not wishdealt with on a quadripartite basis ;   -(vii) the treatment of ships should be postponed pending the outcome of theThree-Power Conference.J.
