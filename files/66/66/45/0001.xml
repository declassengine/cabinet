At Flushing clearance work is progressing rapidly but the entrance tothe outer port is still obstructed by four blockships.A swept channel has been established through the Dutch inland waterwaysfrom the northern end of the South Beveland canal to Moerdijk and is now opento normal traffic.3. Lorient, La Rochelle and La Pallice are being cleared by German mine-sweepers under the supervision of French officers. In Lorient the last wrecks wererefloated on the 1st of this month.4.

Kistna (sloop) recently destroyed 15 large sampans beachedon an island off the Mergui coast.7. At Rangoon the harbour can now accommodate battleships. It isestimated that, in about five weeks, 74 per cent, of the deep-water berths and50 per cent, of the smaller jetties will be in working order.8. During operations on the coast of Arakan between the 14th December,1941, and the 1st March, 1945, HM. and Allied warships have carried out247 bombardments in support of the army and have expended 23,300 rounds ofammunition.Pacific.Borneo.9.

Enemy positions on Labuan Islandwere shelled early in the week.Caroline and Marshall Islands.10. On the 14th and 15th ships of the British Pacific Fleet, which includedH.M.S. Implacable and also H.M.N.Z.S. Achilles and H.M.C.S. Uganda (cruisers),operated against the island of Truk. Carrier-borne aircraft made continuousattacks on docks, shipping, airfields and gun positions and caused considerable damage. The ships also carried out a bombardment. Enemy fire from shore batteries was negligible and anti-aircraft fire was only moderate. Two Japanese aircraft were destroyed on the ground : one Seafire is missing.II. The U.S. battleship Nevada and U.S. destroyers bombarded Jaluit inthe Marshalls, where the fire of shore batteries was also negligible.Bonin Islands.12.

Two U-boats have reached United Kingdom ports from Bergen duringthe week, bringing the total now in the United Kingdom up to 112.Japanese U-boat Intelligence.15 The following estimates are based on U.S. intelligence. On the1st April, 1944, Japan had about 70 U-boats of 500 tons or over and, a year later,about 60. Some 40 were completed during the year and at least the same numberwere sunk. There is a far greater proportion &quot;of boats of over 1,000 tons amongthe new construction. Up to four of the large 2,800-ton blockade-running classmay have been completed but one of these was sunk last year. Two 740-tonboats were apparently taken over from the Germans, and of these one hasbeen sunk. Of the total U-boat fleet, about two-thirds are thought to have beenretained in Japanese home waters for the first months of 1945.16. Widely separated attacks by midgets, dating from November of lastyear, indicate renewed activity with these craft. As their maximum range is120 miles they are usually carried for considerable distances by large U-boatsbefore operating.Allied Minesweeping.17. Minesweeping flotillas have been operating in the western approaches to the Channel, in addition to the areas mentioned in last week&apos;s Resume.A total of 222 mines has been destroyed in Home Waters during the week,including 134 in the Irish Sea and St. George&apos;s Channel and 66 off the westcoast of Norway.Searched channels have been established for the approaches to Bergen and toLa Pallice and the Gironde.In the Mediterranean 68 mines have recently been destroyed north of Corsica,37 in the Gulf of Trieste and 4 off Rhodes.Off the Borneo coast, south-west of Brunei, 338 mines were destroyed betweenthe 14th and 17th.
