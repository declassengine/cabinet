(45) 3.29th May, 1945.CABINET.ARABIA-ACQUISITION OF MASIRAH ISLAND AS A PERMANENTR.A.F. BASE.WE attach, for the consideration of the Cabinet, a Memorandum preparedby the Air Ministry and the India Office, containing a proposal that negotiations should be opened with the Sultan of Muscat for a 99-years&apos; lease of MasirahIsland. This island has been used by the R.A.F. as one of their main bases in the arabian Sea area throughout the war, under a wartime agreement with the Sultan,and it is proposed in the Memorandum that, in view of its strategic importance,arrangements should be made to ensure that the facilities on the island should bemade permanently available to us.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for the Colonies,the Minister of State and the Chiefs of Staff have expressed their agreement withthe terms of the Memorandum.Masirah Island, as will be seen from the attached map, lies off the South-East coast of Arabia.* It belongs to the Sultan of Muscat, an independentSovereign, technically neutral in the present war. His relations with us are,however, very close and at the beginning of the war he entered into an agreementwith us whereby in return for a payment of  18,000 a year he undertook to affordus &quot;necessary facilities&quot; in his territory, including those required by theR.A.F., for the duration of the war. Under a separate agreement between the sultan and ourselves similar facilities are enjoyed by the United States army air Force, also for.the duration of the war only.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air and Secretary of State forIndia.H. M.L. S. A.Air Ministry,India Office,29th May, 1945.MEMORANDUM.[29977]* For further details see Appendix.
Military Considerations.2. The air facilities which we enjoy on Masirah Island by this wartimeagreement include both landplane and flying boat facilities and serve two mampurposes : &apos;(i) as a base for General Reconnaissance squadrons engaged in anti-U-boat and shipping patrol operations in the Arabian Sea and Western indian ocean;(ii) as a staging post on the South Arabian reinforcement and transportroute to India.3. During the war we have been able to provide complete air cover forconvoys in these waters by the use of four strategically located bases Aden,Masirah, Karachi and Bombay. Masirah, being centrally situated, is the hub ofthe whole system. From this base a concentrated air effort can be directed against any threat in the central ocean between the Gulf of Aden and Karachi.It is equally well situated to act as a diversionary base for long-range aircraft operating either from Aden or from the Indian bases, and it has the advantageof providing flying-boat as well as land-planej facilities. Without the use ofMasirah it would be extremely difficult and most uneconomical in flying effort to provide anything like complete air protection for our convoys passing throughthe area.4. Of the four bases mentioned above, Masirah is the only one that is notpermanently available to us. The nearest alternatives to Masirah in british territory are Socotra and Jiwani. Neither is satisfactory. Jiwani lies some350 miles north of the main shipping routes and cannot, therefore, provide cover for the southern portion of the Arabian Sea. Socotra is better placed, but wouldbe difficult to develop, and suffers from exposure to both monsoons, which would limit its use. Moreover, neither of these two airfields can be used, as canMasirah, as a convenient diversionary base for aircraft operating from Adenor the Indian bases, and neither can provide the facilities for flying boats whichare available at Masirah.5. The only other airfields in this area are Sciusiban in Italian Somalilandand the landing fields on the Arabian coasts at Salalah, Ras-el-Hadd and Sharjah.None of these is permanently available to us at present, any more than isMasirah, and all of them are inferior to Masirah as G.R. bases, both in positionand in the facilities they provide.6. As a transport base Masirah has performed two functions, the importanceof which is steadily increasing and will be greatly accentuated when the emphasisof the war switches to the Far East.  These functions are (i) use as a staging post on the direct &quot;U.S.A.-West Africa-Aden-Indiaroute, and(ii) use as a link on the southern reinforcement route from the UnitedKingdom and Middle East to India.The main route from the United Kingdom to India at present runs throughIraq and the Persian Gulf, but it is already manifest that tbis route alone willnot be capable of handling the through traffic for India and the Far east which will be generated by the Japanese phase of the war. Part of this trafficwill accordingly have to be diverted through Masirah. Moreover, it is clear that,quite apart from the capacity of the northern route, the southern route viaMasirah is essential as an insurance against any threat to the safety of the mainnorthern route.7. Thus the use of Masirah Island is proving of great value to us in thepresent phase of the war and will be of even greater value in the Japanese phase.As has been stated above, our agreement with the Sultan of Muscat will lapsewith the defeat of Japan. It is clear that in any future war in the Far east the security of our convoy routes in the Arabian Sea and West Indian Ocean andthe availability of a secure transit route for reinforcement and transport aircraft to India and the Far East will be of great importance. It is therefore essentialthat our right to air facilities at Masirah should be placed on a permanentfooting.&apos; 8. There is this further aspect. Masirah lies close to the mouth of thePersian Gulf. The oil resources in this area both present and potential are likelyto be one of the main prizes in any future war.   Our general dispositions for the
defence of the Commonwealth depend to a marked degree on our retainingcontrol of and access to these oil resources. It is not too much to say that thearea between the Suez Canal and India is likely in future to be one of supreme importance for Commonwealth defence, and to defend it properly we must beable to mount and maintain a strong air force in this area. A glance at the mapwill show that our air bases are few and scattered, and that the airfields in iraq and at the northern end of the Persian Gulf are open to serious threat of anattack from the north. Our use of airfields in Iraq, moreover, depends on theIraq Treaty which expires in 1955. One of the main lessons of the air war hasbeen the importance of depth to air defence. Our air defences in this area areshallow in the extreme, and it follows that any step we can take to give themdepth and flexibility will contribute markedly to the security of our vital interestin this focal area.Political Considerations.9. A certain difficulty vis-a-vis the French arising from events of the last century should be mentioned here. In 1862 we made a joint declaration with theFrench, which still holds good, undertaking to respect the independence of the sultan.* By an agreement of 1891 the Sultan pledged himself to us &quot; never tocede, to sell, to mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of his territorysave to the British Government.&quot; In 1899 when the French obtained the grantof a coaling station in Muscat territory we invoked the declaration of 1862against them to secure the cancellation of the lease, and persuaded them to accept in writing the interpretation that the declaration precluded both ourselves andFrance from accepting any lease or cession of Muscat territory. If, therefore,we were now to abide by the letter of this somewhat unfortunate and legallydubious interpretation of the 1862 declaration, we should need to secure theconsent of the French to our either purchasing or leasing Masirah Island.There are, however, obvious difficulties in such a course, and it is consideredthat since French interest in Muscat is now to all intents and purposes negligible(though it was not so in 1899) we should base ourselves on the 1891 agreement and need not inform the French in advance of our intention of negotiating withthe Sultan for the Island.10. As regards the United States, there might be some criticism of our action in acquiring permanent tenure of the Masirah Island on two counts : -(a) On the general grounds that this represents yet another example ofBritish Imperialistic expansion at the expense of a small indepen-dent State, and(b) Because the Americans have constructed certain semi-permanent estab-lishments on the Island and might claim that their interests would beaffected by our action.The Foreign Office do not expect that there will be any undue difficulty in meeting criticism on (a), particularly if a form of tenure is chosen which doesnot involve a transfer of Sovereignty. As far as civil air transit rights areconcerned, such facilities as it may in practice prove possible to grant to com-mercial aircraft on the Island would be available to foreign civil air operatorsto the extent to which international agreements on civil aviation may be applicable. The Foreign Office would wish to inform the State Department just before the deal with the Sultan is formally concluded. As regards (b), the instal-lations constructed by the Americans comprise only a wartime staging post forsome 150 personnel: the cost to them of this construction is not estimated to exceed  20,000 as against our expenditure to date of  120.000 which is likelyto increase substantially before the end of the war with Japan. The wholeroblem of the post-war disposal of wartime installations on foreign territory as yet to be discussed between ourselves and the Americans. If particular diffi-culty arises over the staging post as a result of our lease or purchase of the Island,we could in the last resort offer to purchase the American installations.* The declaration placed on record that Great Britain and Frauce, &quot; taking into consideration the importance of maintaining the independence o  His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and HisHighness the Sultan of Zanzibar, have thought it right to engage reciprocally to respect theindependence of these sovereigns.&quot;[29977] B 2
Method of Acquisition-.11. There are two methods of securing the permanent facilities which we require : (a) By purchasing the Island outright, and(b) By means of a 99 years&apos; lease.Alternative (a) has definite advantages in giving us a freer hand with regard todefensive measures and control of the local inhabitants. In the event of a leasewe should probably need to secure complete surrender by the Sultan of criminal,civil and revenue jurisdiction. It is possible, moreover, that the total expen-diture on a purchase might be less than the expenditure over a term of 99 years for a lease. On the other hand, purchase, which would be difficult- to dissociate,even if this were legally possible, from an acquisition of formal Sovereignty,would make it more difficult for us to meet American criticism, and would in theopinion of the Colonial Office be liable to cause us embarrassment in ourdealings with the Americans on the West Indies bases. Moreover, unless it couldbe arranged by instalments, it would involve us in a heavy commitment of foreign exchange at the very time when this would be most embarrassing. On balance,therefore, and if we can ensure that the terms of the lease put no limitation on our use of the Island in peace and war for military purposes, the acquisitionof a 99 years&apos; lease would be the better course.12. From the advice tendered by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,who conducts our relations with the Sultan locally, it appears that a reasonableoffer for a 99 years&apos; lease would be  3,750 with an initial premium of  7,500.We should, however, be prepared to go somewhat higher than this, if the Sultanproves difficult, and if necessary, to agree to some variation in the incidence of payment as between annual rent and initial premium. In addition the Sultanshould be specifically allowed to retain any royalties on oil which may be produced on the Island.* The Political Resident has suggested, as an additional bargain-ing counter, the offer of the retrocession of the Kuria Muria Islands, which lieoff the centre of the South Arabian coast, and which were ceded to us without compensation by the then ruler in 1854. Such an offer might have some attracted-tion for the Sultan for reasons of prestige, as enabling him to represent the transaction as an exchange of territory. The Colonial Office, however, are aversefrom the suggestion as the Islands, though of little if any value to us, may notbe wholly uninhabited, and such an offer might prove an awkward precedent inmore important spheres.Summary.13. For the reasons that we have outlined above, the Air Ministry considerthat the establishment on a permanent basis of our rights to the use of the airfacilities at Masirah, which we have constructed at considerable cost, will beof the highest importance to our post-war defensive strategy, and they are there-fore of the opinion that the expenditure involved should be treated as one ofthe most urgent charges on our resources in this area. If we are to embark on negotiations with the Sultan, an early decision is required, as it will clearly be of advantage to reach agreement with him before our war-time agreementlapses. It is proposed that the initial cost should be borne entirely by HisMajesty&apos;s Government and that the Government of India should not be invited,at this stage, to contribute towards future expenditure.14. Authority is therefore sought for instruction to be issued to the political resident to negotiate with the Sultan of Muscat for a 99 years lease of MasirahIsland on the basis of an annual payment of  3,750, plus an initial premiumof  7,500, but with authority, in agreement with the Treasury, to increase thesemaximum figures and to vary the incidence of payments within reasonable limitsif this should prove necessary : The Sultan to retain any royalities on oil produced on the Island.* A British company, Messrs. Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., hold a concession from the sultan which covers Masirah. There is no particular reason to believe that oil is to be found on the island, but the Sultan may well attach importance to such a provision, and it is desirableto come to some clear arrangement with the company in particular to exclude the airfieldareas from their field of operations.
Appendix.MASIRAH ISLAND.Masirah Island is about 40 miles in length and between 4 and 10 miles inbreadth, lying about 10 miles from the mainland, from which it is separated by ashallow channel. The, Island is almost destitute of vegetation. All drinkingwater at present hasHo be brought from outside or distilled, though the presenceof water has been reported at two places on the Island. The climate is stated tobe not unhealthy. There are believed to be about 300 inhabitants in normal times,who live mostly by fishing. In 1942 a considerable amount of trouble was encountered with the local inhabitants in connection with the unloading of storesfor His Majesty&apos;s Forces stationed there. As a result, most of the people fled fromthe Island and only a few have since returned. There are, however, now several hundred Muscati and a few Aden labourers who have been brought to the Islandfor the work required by the British and United States Forces there. There aretwo sheikhs who have interests there, one of whom was primarily responsible forthe trouble in 1942 and has since been warned off the Island by the Sultan.
