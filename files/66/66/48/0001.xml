(45) 48.23rd June, 1945.CABINET.Copy No.LETTER FROM RIBBENTROP.Note by the Secretary.BY direction of the Prime Minister I circulate, for the information of theCabinet, the attached undated letter with its enclosure from the former german foreign Minister, which was received in London on Sunday, 17th June, 1945.Copies have been sent to President Truman and Marshal Stalin.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,23rd June, 1945.Field-Marshal Montgomery.Sir,I would be very grateful; if you would forward this letter to the british prime Minister, Mr. Vincent Churchill and to the British Foreign Secretary,Mr. Anthony Eden personally and confidentially. Its contents refers as you will see to a message, the Fuehrer gave me before his death.Yours,(Sgd.) JOACHIM VON RIBBENTROP.Personal and Confidential.Sirs,Radioreports, &amp;c, which I do not quite understand but which, if they weretrue, would come to it, that former collaborators of the Fuehrer are at presentsoiling their own house, are trying to depreciate the Fuehrer, falsify his ideasabout England, calumniate other former collaborators of his, &amp;c, compel me todo, what I really only wanted to do later on : to place myself at the disposal ofthe British Commander in Chief. I shall do it now. It I did not do so, falseimpressions owing to unclear or biassed statements or misunderstandings might arise.If I went during the advance of the British troops in the British occupationzone and not to some other place I did this in the hope of being able to reach youeasier but only at a time when the wars of hatred between victors andvanquished would have calmed down and yielded to evolve reflection andjudgement -to inform you about my last political conversation with Adolf Hitler.This conversation during which as so often lately the Fuehrers deepdisappointment and embitterment about the failure of a political conception was evident, culminated in a kind of last appeal and a message to the leaders of theBritish Empire. This appeal represents at the same time one may well say the last political will of a man, who as a great idealist has loved his people above all, who has lived and fought for his people to his last gasp and in whoseconception of the world the English-German question has always been the centralpoint of his political meditations.I do not know, if the old and noble English custom of fair play is alsoapplicable for a defeated foe. I also do not know if you wish to hear thepolitical testament of a deceased man. But I could imagine that its contents[30105] BPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1945.
might be adapted to heal wounds, which in the course of this bitter war havebeen inflicted and I further believe that its ultimate fulfilment might in thisperilous epoch of our world be able to help to bring about a better future for allpeople.As far as I am concerned I have the duty to do everything I can, to fulfillthis last wish the Fuehrer has expressed to me and therefore give myself into thehands of the British occupation army.Should you be willing to give me the opportunity of bringing last conversa-tion with Adolf Hitler to your knowlidge, I would be grateful, if I could do thispersonally and verbally.If I ask to-day for this interview I feel I should explain to you thefollowuns: :  1. I have been as you know a close collaborator of the Fuehrer in foreignpolitics for many years. I have sworn loyalty and faithfulness to him andalthough I have for a long time ali&apos;eady not .been able to carry my points andviews through with him, I have been a faithful follower of his up to his lasthour. It is for this reason and also, because I have always handled questions offoreign politics and especially the English-German questions with him, thatAdolf Hitler has entrusted me with this. What importance he obviously attachedto the question also shows the following incident : When during the russian advance on Berlin I was cut off with my staff at Xauen and owing to the swiftencirclement I could not return to the city. I have asked the Fuehrer to allowme and my men to join the army of General Wenk in the battle for the reopening of the encirclement rung or if the relieve of Berlin should prove impossible I asked for the dispatch of a &quot; Storch Airoplane, in order that I might be able tojoin the Volkssturm in Berlin and fight this last battle at his side. The Fuehrersent me a message, saying that he appreciated my intention, but as he had already expressed his opinion on former occasions he did not want me to take part inthe fights even now. One needed me later and I should therefore go outside thefighting zone and keep myself ready for further instructions. Such instructionsdid not come any more, as events began to precipitate. But I know that theFuehrer in giving that order has meant our last conversation for the passing on of which I should keep myself prepared.In spite of the diversity of opinion which existed between the Fuehrer andme on foreign politics as well as on questions of world perception (Weltauffassung)I have possessed up to the last the personal confidence of Adolf Hitler. I mustattach importance to confirm this. In case anybody should say anything to thecontrary it would be false, and there are enough witnesses available for this.2. The German foreign policy was in every phase directed by the Fuehrerhimself. Its execution was my task. After my- appointment to the head, of theGerman Foreign Office I have considered it my business to help the Fuehrer inattaining the justified German claims in Europe as laid down by Hitler andthis by diplomatic means. But at the same time I have&apos; considered it just as important to help to adjust the dynamics in the national sociastic doctrine andits principles of world conception (W^eltauffassung) with the necessities andpossibilities of foreign politics. My work was accordingly concentrated on thefollowing or better on the double aim :  (a) Concentration of the greater part of the Germans in Europe within the reich and limitation of the German foreign policy to the fulfilment of this aim; and(b) Evolution of the principles of world peception (Weltauffassung) ofthe party in such a way, that the existence or carrying through of such principleswould not endanger or even make impossible the peaceful living together and collaboration of Germany with the other nations. This had to do especially withthe question of toleration or better adjustment in matters of the churches, in theJewish question, the question of communism, freemasonry, &amp;o, for which I have always pleaded in my verbal reports, memorandums etc. My work to arrive at these two aims was soon overshadowed by the question of world conception(Weltauffassung). Events in Germany, about which I am not informed indetail, because questions of world conception were always treated separately withthe party-authorities concerned, caused a sharp reaction against all desintegratingtendencies in the interior. When after the agreement with Russia 1939, whichwas due to my influence and by which it was possible for me at least to build, abridge between nationalsocialism and communism the communistic propagandarestarted in Germany, the party took the point of view, that against the
totalitarian claim of radical communism only a&apos; nationalsocialism just asradical could hold its own. Consequently matters of world perception(Weltauffassing) gained an ever increasing influence on the affairs of state andsubsiquently also a preponderance to and in questions of foreign policy. in comparison with the question of the maintenance of the unity of the Germanpeople, all other considerations became gradually of no more weight, After theoutbreak of the war the same influence prevailed in the occupied countries inwhich movements with similar ideas and doctrines were promoted and carrying the political life and the foreign office was eliminated. About the question of world conception I have had serious divergencies of views and disputes withHitler, which I presume was also the cause that the Fuehrer never asked me toparty meetings, which he held regularly; an influence on these questions from thedepartment of foreign politics has not been possible for some years,&apos; but if theFuehrer had once decided on a matter his policy was always carried out accordingto the Fuehrer principle.When German-Russian relations severed and the war with Russia broke out, a development which I as the originator of the German-Russian pact morethan regretted, everything was subordinated to the anti-communistic parole.I only mention these facts to show that for a long time already theFuehrer had looked upon this war as the war between the &apos;.&apos; Weltauffassungen,&quot;national and communistic. All other problems f.i. the holding together of theGermanic people, the concert of the European States, whereby territorialquestions were always kept open (though the territories occupied by german troops did not fall under the care of my ministry the Fuehrer always agreed with me to keep these questions open with regards to our future policy withGreat Britain on the old lines) were always seen under the same aspect. Inour last conversation this fundamental idea came again into the foreground,when I remember well the Fuehrer in talking of the war suddenly turned aroundto me and said : &quot; You will see, my spirit will arise from my grave and onewill see that I have been right.&quot;About one point there has always been entire agreement between theFuehrer and myself and that was that a strong and united Germany as a preliminary condition, for a stable and flourishing Europe could only exist onthe long run by a close collaboration with Great Britain. What the Fuehrerand myself have done, I first alone and then as his envoy, for the realization ofthis English-German conception during the last quarter of a century is knownto all people concerned. I believe, it was very much. I have the intention to lay down the facts in a chronological survey about the developement of Foreignpolicy since 1933. Here I would like to say only this : In spite of all disappoint-,ment and embitterment about the repeated English rejection of the Germanoffers the English-German collaboration has to his last hour always been thepolitical creed of the Fuehrer. He has spoken often in vehement termsabout British politics, which he did not understand, but everyone who knew theFuehrer was well aware that&quot; it was one of the most outstanding features of hischaracter that impulse though he was he never changed his fundamentalconvictions. For this reason in all those years I worked for him and in all our discussions on foreign politics he always came back to this cardinal point.Every step, political, military etc., during these years was always taken withan eye on this final issue, that is to say to bring Great Britain to terms. Tothe outside world this may at times not have been recognisable and yet it was so. That England declared war oh Germany over the Polish question, a war which we both wanted to avoid by all means and which I tried and almostsucceeded to prevent at the last moment, came lastly as a great shock to theFuehrer.Now shortly before the bitter end and before his death Hitler has shownhimself once more and in spite of his very poor state of health in his oldingenious way. He has with extraordinary clearness quite detached from the events of the day, the war situation and the political combinations given me an extensive survey of the coming developements of world politics, as he saw it.He has in an almost prophetic way pointed out the decisive importance, whichin this century of the formation of large combined political areas (GrossraumGestaltung) must be attached to English-German relations and herewith alsoto the relations with the present enemies the U.S.A., Sov jet-Union,France, etc. He said, what after this lost war could be contributed by theGerman side, to establish a stable balance of power between the big politicalareas, in order that not again and irresistably new war catastrophes would come over Europe, over the British Empire and over the whole world.[30105] b 2
We spoke of Russia and the Fuehrer mentioned the gigantic display of powerof the Sovjet Union and its doctrines and in this connection he repeatedly referredto the creation of the Red Army by Stalin and called this a &quot; grandiose &quot; deed.And he further said, that &quot; in spite of the divergencies in the Weltauffassung &quot;Germany simply had to come to a good relationship with Sovjet Russia, as bothpeople had to live side by side on the long run. We also spoke of Japan, for whom the access to vital raw materials was barred and who had to fight a heavywar for it today. We also spoke at length of the U.S.A. Ffitler regretted thewar with Amerika, because we had no possible divergencies with this big nation.We had always regretted this war from the beginning and have done everythingwe could to prevent it even when our ships were being attacked. The Fuehrersaid, that good and lasting relations to the U.S.A. absolutely had to be found.Both people Japan and U.S.A. would have to play their part in the balance of power and in the collaboration of the world. But always again during that con-versation the Fuehrer came back to the question of the English-German relations in the frame of the European politics with the other powers France, Italy andof this balance of power in the world. It was one of the most harmoniousconversations I had had with the Fuehrer for a long time and I was in entire agreement with all his views, as I had for a long time at various occasions beenproposing negociations to finish the bloodshed on such a basis of agreementbetween all nations.   But all tentatives never materialized.Sirs, you have won the war and you hold all power in your hands. May I, asthe last foreign minister of a defeated nation and as a man, who in spite of allbitterness of war and of all untruths about his alleged antagonism or &quot; hatred &quot;of England, has always considered England as his second home and who hasalways wanted the English-German alliance just as much as the Fuehrer himself,point out this :An enormous to me not comprehensible wave of hatred is at present over-whelming the defeated German nation. When England at a time was in a difficult position, when it was after all within the possibility that England mightnot win this war, it was in summer 1940 at headquarters of the western front, theFuehrer spoke to me of the coining peace with Great Britain, &quot; a peace, which as he said must never in any way violate Englands prestige and esteem in theworld &quot; and &quot; with the English-German peace a fill alliance for life and deathshould be found between the two great nations. Only restitution of one or two ofthe German colonies should be agreed upon as a just German claim. That wasall and I fully agreed with the Fuehrer. In comparison with this to-day con-cent ration camps are taken as the cause of a very serious campaign against theGerman people. With regards to the fact that everything what is to-day said about this subject by a German is at once taken up by publicity it is difficult forme to say anything at all on this question. But in this letter which is meantpersonal and confidential I would like to say this : Any inhuman treat-ment of a prisoner is an impossible way of acting and every decent Germanwill like me deplore such acts and condemn them wholeheartily. I want to say this emphatically and furthermore clear up one point : Neither Inor, I am certain, most of my colleagues in the former government had any idea, what was happening in concentration camps, in what conditionsthey were, whether any misdeeds were committed there, as daily Radioreports are saying, This may perhaps surprise, but for a person acquainted with our government system this is quite comprehensible. When once Iheard from a diplomatic reports that ill-treatment of jews in a concentra-tion camp in Poland was discussed vehemently in diplomatic circles abroad, I took the report at once to the Fuehrer urging immediate change, if it were true.The Fuehrer kept the report to look into the matter but gave me clearly to under-stand that this was a question of the interior authorities. I do indeed not write thisdown here with the intention to lay down responsibilities but only because it isthe simple truth. But 1 ask myself, can one charge a whole nation with suchexcesses committed by individuals, as is being done now, excesses which I believehave occurred in the history of all nations? As far as my attitude is concernedin the question of prisoners, I presume this has become known to everybody duringthe war, during which I have stood up for the carrying out of the Geneva Con-vention and more until! the last day, an attitude which has been of vitalimportance for the prisoners of all nations who fought against us, American,English, Russian French etc.I remember in this connection a conversation with the Fuehrer in which he made a comparison with the treatment of the nationalsozialists during the time before 1933 by the former government and the treatment of his political oponunts
after 1933. This government had put him and his men in prison wheras hewas paying his opponents, former social-democrates, like Severing, Noski, etc.,good pensions, etc.A few days ago it was published that the Wehrmacht had not foughthonourably and that the German people would have to learn decency again.Sirs, can one say this of a defeated enemy, who has fought bravely and of apeople who have made superhuman efforts for their country and have lost every-thing? Can one put down Germans who as patriots a charakteristic, whichsurely makes every Englishman, every member of a decent nation proud have only done their duty towards their country, as war criminals and punish them as such?   I would like to appeal to the generosity of the victors.In finishing this letter, for the length and English of which I must ask yourindulgence I would like to say this :I have been a patriot all my life. I have placed myself at the disposal ofAdolf Hitler in the desire to help him to save our country from ruin in 1933and to build up a strong and united Germany in Europe and simultaneously to attain the English-German alliance without war, that is to say by way of diplomatic negociations. This was my very clear aim. As far as questions of&quot; Weltauffassung&quot; are concerned I always was an opponent to the radical partyprogramme. I have always opposed the policy against jews, churches, free-masons, etc., which I considered in principle a fault and which has causedtremendous difficulties in foreign politics. This my attitude was known not onlyto the Fuehrer. When, very much against my will, war broke out after all, Ihave from that day of course taken an attitude of hard determination and complete conviction in the German victory for internal and external reasons.This attitude was also known. But this attitude has not prevented me, tocontinuously keep an eye on the question of an arrangement with the ennemies,in order to seize the first occasion for a peace feeler. In my more intimateconversations with the Fuehrer I continuously placed this point before him andstressed him to allow me to clo something about it, but he, after the fruitlessattempt for peace in the Reichstag, 1940, was sceptical about my plans andendeavours in this direction. Inspite of various confidential peace tentativesthere has (owing to the uncompromising attitude of the ennemy) never beena serious occasion to end this war. The war is lost for Germany. Inspite ofthis fact I am of the holy conviction that the bringing about of a real friendshipbetween the English and the German people is a fundamental necessity, if bothnations will live on the long run. The Fuehrer was of the same opinion and has there fore entrusted me with the mission to inform you, if possible, about his reasons and ideas concerning this collaboration and the quite new form, which inhis opinion should be found for it. In order to fulfill this last mission I lay myfate into your hands.(Signed) JOACHIM VON RIBBENTROP.I would be grateful if this letter could not be published. I will ask Field-Marshal Montgomery to send it to you under &quot; personal and confidential.&apos;&apos;-
