THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 44.mth June, 1945.CABINET.EASTERN EUROPEAN SUPPLIES.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and minister of Production.ON the 11th February, 1945, while at Yalta, the Foreign Secretary proposedto the United States Secretary of State and the People&apos;s Commissar for ForeignAffairs that discussions between officials should take place in Moscow on the promotion of production of foodstuffs and important raw materials in eastern europe and stressed the desirability of treating Europe as an economic unity, theservices of one region being used to meet the deficiencies of another. M. Molotovhas never replied to this suggestion.2. As my colleagues are aware, it is with the utmost difficulty that we are meeting the minimum demands of the liberated areas in the Anglo-Americansphere of responsibility and in Western Germany. Before the war and duringthe German occupation a substantial proportion of the requirements of thewestern areas used to come from Eastern Germany and the Danubian basin. Aslate as 1943-44 it was estimated that as much as 4 million tons of foodstuffs ayear were travelling west. In addition, before the war Poland had large exportsof coal. During the war the Polish and German Silesian coalfields have nearlydoubled their production.3. The coarse of military operations, the fact that Russian armies and largenumbers of displaced persons have had to live off the land and the effect of suddenagrarian reforms has reduced food productivity in Eastern Europe probably t(?a point where there is no surplus for export. There apparently remains,however, a substantial coal surplus. *4. In addition to the U.N.R.R.A. food requirements for Poland and czechoslovakia, the Russians may also be still expecting large supplies of food from Anglo-American controlled sources and by way of Reparations fromGermany. 1 consider it should be made clear to the Russians that these surplusfood areas under their control must not only look after themselves but shouldalso be in a position to help the west. It would probably be advisable to raisethe question of coal at the same time. I therefore suggest that the ForeignOffice should be invited to instruct our Ambassador in Moscow to make theposition clear to the Russians forthwith. It is also for consideration whetherthis matter should be raised at the forthcoming meeting in Berlin of the Headsof States.5. As regards U.N.R.R,A.&apos;s requirements for Poland and Czechoslovakiait would be inadvisable to press for the rejection of these outright. I consider,however, that our representatives on the Combined Boards should be instructedto see that these requirements receive a -thorough scrutiny and that it is madeGear that U.N.R.R.A. only exists to provide supplies in order to supplement thosewhich are available locally.O.
