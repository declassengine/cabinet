THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 13.kth June, 1945.CABINET.NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.THE public will expect at the Election to know where the Government standon the National Health proposals on which we have given no indication of policyapart from the White Paper of February 1944.In order to carry the Labour part of the Coalition, we put into thatWhite Paper certain proposals envisaging that there might be salaried practice in Health Centres and that doctors practising in the Centres would be in contract with the local authority as well as with a Central Medical Board., Theseproposals proved unpopular with the doctors.The Minister of Health has, with the late Secretary of State for Scotland,carried through many months of negotiation with the several professional bodies concerned.He has come down against salaried practice in the Health Centres and any direct contract between the local authorities and general practitioners. This willgive great satisfaction to the medical profession.Further, in all substantial matters, he has got agreement with the voluntary hospitals and with all local authorities except the London County Council. InScotland, too, a wide measure of agreement has been secured.I suggest that it would be well to state the Government position now in theform of the attached short Parliamentary paper submitted by the Minister ofHealth and Secretary of State for Scotland.W.Office of the Lord President of the Council,4th June, 1945.Copy No.[30005]

PROGRESS WITH THE PROPOSALS FOR ANATIONAL HEALTH SERVICEIINTRODUCTORYi. The White Paper on a National Health Service was published inFebruary, 1944. Its purpose was not to announce a finally settled scheme.It was intended that the proposed service should be freely examined and dis-cussed with all concerned before final decisions were taken, and that thePaper itself should serve as a focus for such discussions. It was hoped that draft legislation for establishing the service could then be prepared, in thelight of the discussions, for submission to Parliament.2. In March, 1944, the White Paper was debated in both Houses ofParliament and both Houses welcomed the intention, declared in the Paper,to establish a comprehensive health service.3. Since then, discussions have taken place between the Health Ministers(the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland) and repre-scntatives of the local government authorities, voluntary hospitals, and themedical and dental professions, of nursing, midwifery, and pharmacy, andof other organisations and bodies concerned in the proposals. In these dis-cussions the ways and means of establishing and maintaining the new servicehave been reviewed, various alternative suggestions have been examined andideas have been exchanged in accordance with the intention expressed inthe White Paper.4. The content of these discussions could not be made public while the dis-ciissions proceeded. It was of their purpose and nature that the talks shouldbe free and informal and should not involve the taking and announcing ofGovernment decisions at all stages. It was felt to be more profitable thatthere should first be consultations between the two Ministers and the variousrepresentative bodies over the whole field and that after that the Governmentshould assess the situation as a whole, in the light of these consultations, and make known their conclusions to Parliament in the form of a Bill. Thispoint, at which draft legislation could have been considered and settled, hadpractically been reached when, in view of the imminence of a dissolution, it became clear that there was insufficient time for consideration of the detailedterms of a Bill or for its introduction in the present session.5. In this situation there was an obvious possibility that much of theprotracted work of the last year might lead to no early conclusions, in spiteof the energy and the goodwill which all the different representative bodieshad devoted to it in the interests of arriving at a good service. It might havebeen that the discussions would have been interrupted, for several months atleast, without Parliament and the public being able in any way to judge oftheir usefulness and of the progress so far made.6. The Government therefore think it their duty to report to Parliament.They have reviewed the whole of the ground so far covered and have decided,on as many as possible of the issues involved, what measures they wouldbe prepared to recommend to Parliament for inclusion in new legislationwhen it can be introduced. The purpose of this Paper is to set out thedecisions which they have reached.7. These decisions do not cover every aspect of the necessary legislation.There are some points on which the Government feel that further considera-iion is desirable before conclusions are reached. There will also be manymatters forming more naturally the subject of detailed statutory regulations43052 a 2
submitted   after   the  general  legislative  framework   has   been   settled_onwhich the various representative organisations ought to be further consultedBut the conclusions summarised  in  this Paper touch upon most of the issues with which any Bill will have to deal, and indicate the way in whichthe present Government would propose to deal with them.8. These proposals differ in a number of respects from the correspondingproposals set out in the White Paper of 1944. They do not differ in regardto any of the fundamental objectives of the comprehensive service, or inregard to the fullness of its range or its universal availability to tnc public;the)&apos; do not differ in regard to, any of its governing principles or its generalconception. They affect only ways and means and not ends. Where theydiffer, the changes from the earlic proposals are mainly designed tostrengthen the protection of - individual freedom in using or providing anypart of the service, to eliminate any possible excess of standardisation andto encourage variety and individuality in the services provided.9. The position in Scotland. The proposals which follow refer to theservice in England and Wales. While maintaining the same objectives andgeneral principles for the service in Scotland, the earlier White Paper pro-posed a somewhat different administrative structure, chiefly as regards localorganisation, to fit the different conditions there. The considered views ofcertain of the organisations concerned, with which the special Scottish features of the proposed service have been discussed, have not yet been made known to the Government, and in particular the medical profession have yet to hold their Representative Meeting on the subject. In any case aseparate Bill for Scotland will be necessary. Apart, however, from certain points mentioned below (para. ) the Government do not contemplate that any substantial modifications of the Scottish proposals as contained inthe earlier White Paper will be found necessary.IIOUTLINE OF THE REVISED PROPOSALSGeneral objectives and principles to. All the main objectives and principles of the earlier White Papermust, in the Governments view, be fully assured, including:  (i) a comprehensive service, covering all forms of medical and alliedcare for all people who wish to take advantage of it, free from any financialdeterrents;(ii) freedom for everybody to use the service or not, and freedom forevery professional man or woman to take part in the service or not;(iii) freedom of choice of doctor, with no question of creating a separatestate medical service distinct from the ordinary practice of medicine;(iv) complete clinical freedom for doctors and other professional peopletaking part, with no question of lay supervision of the professional person&apos;sclinical discretion and judgment in his patients&apos; interests;(v) the full partnership of the two great hospital systems of the country,with participation of the voluntary hospitals as autonomous bodies and noquestion of them being &quot; taken over &quot; by the State;(vi) a proper combination of public responsibility for the service and the participation of the expert in its provision centrally and locally.
4Range of the serviceii. The new service must be designed to secure: (a) a family doctor of the patient&apos;s own choice, working usually fromhis own surgery as now but with a full experiment conducted in theopening years in the varied possibilities of publicly equipped health centres;(6) all kinds of hospital and sanatorium services, including medical re-habilitation, and all kinds of specialist and &quot; second-opinion &quot; servicesorganised in and from the hospitals;(c) priority dental services for expectant and nursing mothers, young children and schoolchildren; also a general dental service which, while notable to guarantee that during the present shortage of dentists, treatment willbe available in every instance, would offer all necessary treatment to all who can arrange with a dentist taking part in the service to provide it;(d) a service for the care of the eyes and provision of spectacles;(e) maternity and child welfare, midwifery and home-nursing services;and home-helps in case of need through sickness;-(/) all necessary drugs, medicines and appliances, and ambulances and hospital transport services;(g) a public health laboratory service and a blood transfusion serviceorganised on a national basis;(h) the greater fusion, in future, of responsibility for the mental and the physical health services in a single administrative organisation centrallyand locally.Central organisation of the service12. As the earlier White Paper emphasised, the central organisation ofthe service will be based upon the central responsibility to Parliament andthe people, in the normal constitutional manner, of the Minister of Health.The present responsibilities of the Board of Control for mental health,under the Lunacy Acts and Mental Deficiency Acts will be transferred tothe Minister of Health, with the exception of functions specially concernedwith the liberty of the subject in respect of the detention of persons ofunsound mind and mental defectives; for these the Board will be continued.13. A new and statutory organisation will be set up at the centre, to advise the Minister. This will consist of a Central Health Services Council representing in a single body all the main expert fields, medicine and sur-gery, dentistry, nursing, midwifery, pharmacy, and voluntary hospital andlocal government experience and also of various separate Standing AdvisoryCommittees associated with the Council, but with direct access to the minister as well as to the Council.14. These separate advise^/ Committees will include a general medicaladvisory committee, a hospitals advisory committee, another on dentistry,one on nursing, one on mental health and one on pharmacy. All the pro-ceedings and reports of these Committees will automatically be made knownto the Central Council as well as to the Minister, and the Central council will be able to pick up any subject on which it thinks that its wider generalpoint of view should be expressed, and advise the Minister on it.15. The members of the Central Council and the Standing Advisory Com-mittees will be appointed by the Minister only after full consultation with the professional and other organisations concerned; there will also be some exofficio members. The Council and the Committees will be able to adviseat all times, of their own initiative, and will not be restricted to questions referred to them by the Minister.   The Minister will publish an annual report
of the work of the Council and Committees, prepared by the Council itselfexcept in so far as there may be some reason of the public interest for not doing so. The Council and Committees will appoint their own chairmen and arrange their own procedure; they will have joint secretariats i.e. onesecretary appointed by themselves and one supplied by the Minister.16. Generally, the object will be to bring to the responsible Ministers sidea strong and thoroughly representative grouping of the best expert opinion in all fields of health service policy, and to give that opinion full opportunityof expressing itself to him.Local organisation for planning local services as a single whole area Planning Bodies17. The comprehensive service needs to be planned over suitably wide areas,with a proper degree of expert and professional participation in the making,and keeping up to date, of the plan. If this is secured in the manner pro-posed in the next paragraph there is not, in the Governments view, anyneed in England and Wales for any large scale transfer to new executive joint boards of the hospital functions of the major elected local authorities, as was contemplated in the earlier White Paper. It was always recognisedthat the balance of advantage in this transfer was open to question, exceptin Scotland where the relatively small population of the average local health authority&apos;s area turned the scale decisively.18. It is now proposed that there should be areas determined for therational planning of the health service as a whole, and that these should be similar to the &quot; Joint Authority &quot; areas of the White Paper; i.e. there shouldbe about 30 or 35 of them for the whole country, with a population of anything from half a million to about two millions in each. For each of these areas, there will be established a new Health Services Council, charged withthe statutory duty of preparing a health services plan for the whole area and of submitting it to the Minister for final confirmation the confirmed planbecoming the binding scheme which all concerned must observe, and beingconstantly revised and kept up to date.19. These Health Sendees Councils will consist, in a proportion of about : 2, of the representatives of the major local authorities (counties and county boroughs) of the area on the one hand, and of representatives of the voluntary hospitals, the medical profession, dentistry, nursing and midwiferyon the other. Each will probably be a body of something like 30 members,with 18 local authority and 12 other representatives and a chairman appointedby the Minister.20. In view of the special considerations affecting the hospital and specialist services part of the area plan, a special Hospital Services Group will be estab-lished for each of the new planning areas, which will prepare this part of theplan and provide it for incorporation in the general plan by the Health ServicesCouncil. If the latter body modifies the plan, and there is any resulting dis-agreement, the Minister will decide the issue. These Hospital Services Groupswill consist of equal numbers of voluntary hospitals and local authoritymembers, together with representatives of specialist and general medical practice. They will need to have special committees on the planning of the mental services.Regional Advisory Councils21. There is, in the Governments view, a good case for bringing into the planning and arrangement of the service the voice of those qualified to look at the subject particularly the more highly specialised sendees which need to be correlated over larger fields from the point of view of even wider
,   . 42areas or regions, based upon the natural spheres of influence of universities withmedical teaching schools. It is proposed, therefore, that for each of theten or so spheres of influence of the university medical teaching centres,there shall be sot up a small, highly expert advisory body, to be known as the Regional Advisory Council. These Councils will consistof, say, 15 members, including members representing the universitieswith schools of medicine, specialist medical practice, and voluntary hospital and local government experts. Their functions will be to assist the areaplanning bodies throughout in the making of their plans, providing the neces-sary correlating advice over the wider regions; to have the opportunity also of advising the Minister finally on the plans as submitted to him; to establishmachinery for advising on the appointment of specialists by all hospitals inthe region, and to undertake such other expert functions (such as surveys of hospital resources in their region) as the Minister might call upon them atany time to perform.The Condon area22. For the special circumstances of the London area, some of the detailsof this planning machinery may need to be. adapted; this is for further con-sideration. But the general principles of combined planning, the participation of the experts of various kinds, and the influence of wider regional considera-tions, would all apply in some suitable form.Hospital and Specialist Services under the plan.23. The area plan described will settle, as the earlier White Paper pro-posed, the general lay-out of the various hospital and specialist resourcesof the area, the best use to be made of existing resources and the new pro-vision needing to be made to make up deficiencies. Both the voluntary hospitals and the local authorities will have joined in arranging this plan.It will then be for both to carry out their allotted parts in it.24. A voluntary hospital thus agreeing to play its part in the scheme will play that part under its own management and with full autonomy as a voluntary institution. It will be, as it were, in the position of an indepen-dent contractor, providing agreed services in accordance with the arrange-ments of the plan which the voluntary hospitals, as well as the localauthorities, will have shared in making.25. A voluntary hospital will receive from public funds two kinds of ser-vice payments, central and local, for the services which it will have agreedto render under the local plan:  (a) The central payments will be made by the Exchequer, and will be atrates settled with the voluntary hospitals&apos; representatives in respect of eachof the main types or classes of services rendered. If it proves desirable toarrange for some element of grouping of any part of the total moneys sodue, and their redistribution among individual hospitals on some basistaking more account of individual needs, the Government will be preparedto consider this.(b) The local service payments will also be at rates settled centrally, inconsultation with the voluntary hospitals&apos; representatives and those ofthe local authorities. They will be received by the voluntary hospitals,not from individual local authorities, but from a single new &quot; clearinghouse &quot; serving each planning area. This clearing house will be pro-vided so as to enable both voluntary hospitals and municipal hospitalstaking patients from other local authority areas all to draw their appro-priate service payment from one source, while all local authorities can
simply pay into that source a flat rate payment for every patient from their area going into any hospital other than their own hospitals no matter to what hospital, voluntary or municipal the patient goes.26. In fixing the appropriate scales for central and local service payments in consultation with the voluntary hospitals, the desirability of making cleartheir continuing voluntary status and their continuing link with the voluri-tary good-will of the public will be kept fully in mind. This will be relevantin determining the proportion of their resources for which they will look to public funds, and it is therefore a vital matter to them and to the volun-tary contributor)&apos; and savings associations which have been so valuable a link between the hospitals and the public in the past. The Government doesnot want to determine it finally at this stage, until it has been discussed withthem in further detail. There will also need to be proper provision for enabling the voluntary hospitals to obtain necessary capital assistance incarrying out new undertakings which they may have agreed to carry out inaccordance with the new area plans.27. As already indicated, there will be no general transfer of the munici-pal hospitals to new Joint Authorities, and the duty to provide municipalhospital services of all kinds in accordance with the area plans will fall infuture upon the county and county borough councils. The expenditureof these Local Authorities on the hospital services as on all other local health services for which the)- are responsible, will be the subject of appro-priate exchequer assistance to be determined in consultation with theirrepresentatives.28. The general objects and scope of the hospital and specialist services willbe the same as those in the original White Paper, and need not be set out againhere. The principal changes in the proposed ways and means lie in (a) thecomplete re-arrangement of the earlier proposals for &apos;&apos; Joint Authorities &quot;and area planning, already referred to, (b) the direct participation of the voluntary hospitals and professional experts in the making of the area plans and in the new regional advisory machinery already described, (c) the modifiedsystem of payments for sen ices rendered, just outlined, (d) the amplificationof the central advisory resources at the Minister&apos;s side, mentioned earlier inthis Paper.Other local authority services29. In the new organisation the new general duty to secure all kinds of hospital and specialist services will, as was always intended, absorb in alarger whole many of the present separate services which really belong tothat sphere e.g. tuberculosis, isolation hospitals for infectious diseases, in-stitutional maternity, cancer; and the poor law medical institutions will cease to exist as such.30. But, outside the new range of the hospital and specialist services, therewill be certain local authority services (e.g the provision of maternity and child welfare clinics) which will still require special statutory provision inthe new legislation. There will also be some new functions (e.g. the provisionof a home-nursing service and of home-helps in illness) which will need to beadded. All of these local authority services will be joined in future in thehands of the county and county borough councils, as the earlier White Paperproposed, except for the delegation of child welfare arrangements where childeducation is already delegated.31. All of this will be broadly as the earlier White Paper contemplated,and there is no material new point to record under this heading. All of these local authority services will, of course, become the subject of the new areaplanning system, and in future all will rest upon a clear duty to provide a lullservice, and not merely upon a power to do so.
32. The local authorities should, it is felt, each be required to establish infuture a new all-purpose health committee (comparable to their statutoryeducation committees). In the Governments view, these health committeesought in future to include a proportion of doctors and persons of special experience in the health services. The committees will have various sub-committees, including one on mental health.General medical practitioner service33. Arrangements for assuring a personal or family doctor&apos;s care for all will, as the earlier White Paper stressed, be the first-line provision of the nowservice. But there will be some changes in the means proposed in the earlierPaper for securing this.34. In the main, this part of the new service will be organised on linesalready familiar under the present National Health Insurance system, withthe great difference that it will in future be backed by all the specialistand hospital services and home-nursing and other facilities provided underthe new area schemes and, of course, that it will in future be equally avail-able to all people. At the same time, there will be conducted a carefullyworked out experiment, on a substantial scale, in new developments ofthe &quot; Health Centre &quot; type to which the earlier White Paper referred.Ordinary general medical practice arrangements35. Under the revised arrangements there will be no need in England andWales (in the Government&apos;s view, which they understand the medical pro-fession to share) for the creation of the Central Medical Board proposedin the earlier White Paper. General practitioners will look in future, fortheir contract and remuneration, to a new local Committee taking the placeof and broadly similar to the present local Insurance Committee. ThisCommittee will in each area consist, as to one-half, of representatives of thepublic (two-thirds of these being nominated by the county or county borough council, and one third by the Minister) and, as to the other half, of profes-sional representatives of the doctors, dentists and chemists taking part inthe service. There will be local professional committees for the doctors,dentists and chemists, which will stand in broadly the same relationship to the new local Committee as the Medical and Panel and PharmaceuticalCommittes stand now in relation to the present Insurance Committees; andthere will continue to be various special sub-committees, as now, to dealwith complaints and disciplinary matters.36. General terms of service and remuneration will be settled by centralconsultation with the professions concerned, as they are now, and will be broadly based on the same methods of payment (as distinct from amounts of payment) as now. The settlement of the amounts of doctors&apos; remunerationwill be reached in the light of the report of the special Committee recently setup under Sir Will Spens, by agreement with the profession, to advise afreshon the proper standards and range of remuneration in general medical practice.37. After careful consideration the Government do not believe that any-substantial advantage would he gained by the earlier proposals to try toimprove the distribution of general medical practice by requiring practitionersto obtain official consent to starting or taking over a practice, or by requiringfull time practice from young doctors in certain areas. They do not feelthat these restrictions upon the present freedom of choice by professionalmen and women and their potential patients would be justified by anyresults which would in fact be likely to accrue. They believe that the sameobjectives can be better achieved by devising some suitable system of more attractive terms for work in less attractive areas, and they propose to explore
this further. There is already a power in the National Health insurance acts for the Minister to supersede the ordinary arrangements in any par.ticular area, and to substitute other arrangements, if he is satisfied that a proper service is not being provided in that area; this power will be retained,and applied to the new and wider service.Health Centres38. During the opening years of the scheme, a controlled experiment willbe conducted with various types of publicly provided and equipped health centre, including health centres for the conduct of general practice by doctorswilling to transfer their practices, or to open new practices in them. the centres will be provided, equipped and maintained by the local county or county borough councils, as the earlier White Paper proposed, but the doctorstaking part in them will remain like the doctors in separate practice under contract only with the new Comiruuee which takes the place of the InsuranceCommittee, and will not need to join in a special three-party contract as wasearlier proposed. The local authority will arrange with that Committee, andnot with the individual doctors, for the use of the premises by doctors forthe purposes of the new service. This will facilitate ease of movement in and out of separate and health centre practice, by eliminating any differences ofcontractual status between the doctors inside or outside the centres.39. Doctors in the health centres should, it is thought, be remunerated bythe Committee as a group partnership the aggregate capitation fees due tothem under the ordinary system being pooled and redistributed among them-selves under a partnership agreement. Competition for patients within thegroup, or for the us-&quot; of the facilities in the centre, will thus be avoided.40. The health centre experiment must be on a wide enough scale to yieldreliable information as to the advantages and popularity of the system, andfurther developments will depend on the results obtained. The Minister incontrolling the experiment will have the help of the advisory machineryalready described.Sale and purchase of medical practices41. As already announced on behalf of the coalition Government^ therewill be no abolition or restriction in the first few years of the present pro-fessional custom of the sale and purchase of goodwill. As soon as the resultsof the operation of the new service and the effects^for instance, upon practicevalues of the health centre system can be better ascertained, there will bea full enquiry into the merits and possibilities of altering the system with proper compensation on the lines of the recent pronouncement on the subject in Parliament.Dental services42. A priority dental service for mothers and young children will rest upona new duty put upon local authorities, in place of their present power, aspart of their maternity and child welfare functions. Similar provision hasalready been made for schoolchildren in the Education Act of last year.43. In addition to this, the Government believe that a general dental service can be organised in accordance with the principles of the Teviot Committee&apos;sreport, under which any person able to arrange with a dentist for dental carewithin die new scheme can Be enabled to get all necessary care without fees or charges, although no guarantee can be given of the immediate availability of dental care in all cases owing to the acute shortage of professional personnel.Such a service will be an extension of the earlier White Paper proposals, and* By the Minister of Health, in] a reply to a Question in the House of Commons on 3rd May, 1944.
it needs further exploration with the dental profession. Discussions in this field have had to start later than in other fields, and are correspondingly lessfar advanced, owing to the need to await the report of the Teviot committee before they could begin.44. The merits and advantages of dental health centres, or dental depart-rrients in health centres, will be ascertained by controlled experiments on similar lines to the medical health centres.Ophthalmic service45. The Government believe that a full service for the care of the eyes,available for all who want to use it, should be organised as part of the health service from the outset, although in the earlier White Paper some doubt was expressed as to whether this was yet practicable. Discussions of the best methods by which, and the stages through which, such a service can best be achieved are in progress.Mental health services46. Arrangements need to be made for a closer association of the mental and physical health services. At the centre the mental health functions of thepresent Board of Control will, subject to the exceptions already mentioned inregard to restraints upon the liberty of the subject, be merged in the Ministryof Health- Locally the mental health services will be as much part of the comprehensive area planning as any other part of the new service, the exist-ing executive duties of providing the services becoming a direct function of thecounty and- county borough councils, as part of their wider hospital andclinic duties. Each authority&apos;s new health committee will have a specialstatutory sub-committee on mental health. Visiting Committees under theLunacy Act will be abolished, and any remaining links of the mental health services with the Poor Law will be severed. A full restatement of the law of lunacy and mental deficiency will be undertaken later, as soon as conditionspermit.Other Developments47. It is proposed that there shall be established a public health patho-iogical laboratory- service, organised centralty and on a national basis bythe Minister, in the first instance through the agency of the Medical research council. Its object will be, without superseding the present laboratory workof local authorities, to provide them and others with a free bacteriologicalservice for the control of infectious diseases, and to perpetuate the advantages of a nationally organised epidemiological sendee which the war experienceof the Emergency Laboratory Sen-ice has so well demonstrated. Similarly,arrangements will be made on a national scale to continue the advantages of the blood transfusion service which, under the Emergency HospitalScheme, has been vigorously developed during the war. Ambulance and hos-jjiial transport services will fall to be locally- arranged within each ofthe new health planning areas, and the responsibility for securing them by direct provision and by contract with voluntary agencies will fall upon the major local authorities in each case.The sen ice in Scotland48. The chief developments of the Scottish proposals, as contained in theearlier White Paper, will be as follows:  (a) The central advisory machinery will be elaborated, with standing advisory Committees in addition to the Scottish Central Health ServicesCouncil on the lines described in paragraph.        of this Paper.(b) The regional Hospitals Advisory Councils (designed for a differentpurpose  from that of the Regional Advisory Councils in  England and
Wales and composed of equal numbers of local authority and voluntary hospitals representatives) take part at an earlier stage than was originally proposed in the planning of hospital and allied services. They will draw up a provisional general plan for the region to guide the Joint HospitalsBoards (i.e. combinations of local authorities) in framing their area schemesfor these services.(c) Local service payments to voluntary hospitals will be made throughclearing-houses on lines described in paragraph of this Paper, operating in Scotland on a regional basis. These clearing-houses will also handle ser-vice payments between Joint Hospitals Boards. The net expenses of theJoint Hospitals Boards will be raised by requisitions from their constituentauthorities, who will in turn he grant-aided ori all their health servicesexpenditure.(a) The changes proposed in paragraph of this Paper in regard tothe general medical practioner service will be adopted in Scotland, although there may be found to be a continuing need for the Scottish Central medical board proposed in the earlier White Paper.(e) The Local Medical Services Committees of the earlier White Paper,covering the same areas as the Joint Hospitals Boards, will be composedof equal numbers of lay representatives nominated by the local authoritiesand of professional representatives nominated by the medical and alliedprofessions in the area, together with a few additional members, lay or pro-fessional, appointed by the Secretary of State. In addition to the advisoryfunctions proposed in the earlier White Paper, this Committee will in eachcase also act as the successor to the present Insurance Committees, and forthis purpose there wall be associated professional committees and appro-priate services sub-committees on the lines described in paragraph &apos; ofthis Paper.General49. All the necessary main organisation of the new service should, inthe Governments view, be provided for in a Bill as early as possible in thenew session. Meanwhile, discussions can continue with representatives of the doctors, dentists, hospitals, local authorities, nurses and others on the many other questions which need to be settled. Many of these questions will necessarily involve complicated and detailed arrangements and will, there-fore, have to be the subject of subsequent statutory regulations, subject to review by Parliament.50.. The outline given in this Paper is not intended to be an exhaustivesurvey of the way in which the new service will be organised. It is intendedmainly to draw attention, in a summary form, to certain proposals involvingadjustment of the earlier White Paper proposals, and to give a general indication of the Governments conclusions on the issues which have beendiscussed with the various professional and other organisations over thepast year. It does not take the place of the main White Paper of 1944,but supplements it and brings it up to date.london printed  AND  PUBLISHED  BY   HIS  MAJESTY&apos;S  STATIONERY OFFICETo be purchased directly from H.M.
