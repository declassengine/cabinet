UNITED STATES SCHEDULES OF SHIPPING ANDSUPPLIESSHIPPINGSubject to the provisions of Article II of this Protocol, the Government ofthe United States undertakes to aid the Government of the Union of soviet socialist Republics in the shipment from the Western Hemisphere to the Union of soviet Socialist Republics during the Protocol period of a minimum of 5,700,000short tons of supplies, 2,700,000 short tons to be shipped via the Pacific route and 3,000,000 short tons to be shipped via the Atlantic routes.In addition to the 5,700,000 short tons committed above the Governmentof the United States undertakes to aid the Government of the Union of soviet socialist Republics in the shipment of such material as can be made availableto meet the requirements of a list of supplies submitted to the Government of theUnited States by the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republicson October 17, 1944.The above undertakings are intended to provide shipping from the western hemisphere for all supplies including supplies furnished by the Governmentsof the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada and all relief supplies.To insure accomplishment of the above objective, the Government of theUnited States undertakes to supplement the Soviet Flag shipping which ispresently employed in the Pacific route to the extent necessary to maintain ship-ments at an average rate of 225,000 short tons a month, with the understandingthat the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will use its best efforts in achieving the shortest possible turn-around in the Pacific trade which is consistent with prudent operation. It is further understood that shoulduntoward events preclude or restrict the use of the Pacific route by the U.S.S.R.,the United States shipping transferred to the Soviet Flag for employment onthis route will be utilized on other routes from the Western Hemisphere to theU.S.S.R.The Government of the United States undertakes to provide the shipping for movement by such Atlantic routes as may be available of an average of250,000 short tons a month, provided such capacity proves to be available tothe United States. The above undertaking for shipment by Atlantic routes isconsidered by the Government of the United States to be a minimum and, if conditions permit, every effort will be made to exceed this minimum.In addition to the foregoing undertaking for ocean shipment, the Govern-ment of the United States will aid the Government of the Union of soviet socialist Republics in the movement through the Persian Corridor of petroleum products originating in the Persian Gulf area in an amount not to exceed350,000 short tons.supplies the Government of the United States will make available for shipment tothe Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics during the periodof this Protocol, July 1, 1944 to June 30, 1945, from supplies made available
under the Third Protocol but unshipped on July 1, 1944, and from quantities tobe made available under this Protocol a minimum of 5,944,000 short tons ofsupplies as set forth in Annex I provided the quantities of specific items to bemade available do not exceed the quantities of specific items offered in Annex II.In addition to the supplies referred to above to be made available to theUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Government of the United States will endeavour to make available under the terms of this Protocol such additionalmaterial set forth in the list of supplies submitted to the Government of theUnited States by the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics onOctober 17, 1944 as can be provided within the limits of available resources.(To be designated after agreement on specifications as Annex III.)Except as otherwise specified quantities will be made available at points of origin in the United States and as nearly as practicable in equal monthly install-ments. However, the Government of the United States reserves the right tomake available from sources outside the United States such supplies as may benecessary to provide the specific items desired by the Government of the Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics for delivery under this Protocol. The conditions under which specific items will be made available will be in accordance withthe conditions of the offerings in Annex II forming a part of this Protocol.Undertakings as to supplies are subject to the provisions hereinafter con-tained relative to stockpiles and specifications.STOCKPILESWhile the need for reasonable stockpiles of supplies in the United States isappreciated, it is also recognized that the accumulation of excessively largestockpiles of supplies is not consistent with the most effective utilization in thecommon cause of production facilities and supplies of raw materials. Accord-ingly, it will be necessary for the Government of the United States to limit the size of individual stockpiles either by control of production, by diversion ofproduct, or by repossession, when in its judgment such action is in the bestinterest of the common cause. In taking such action, the Government of theUnited States will give due consideration to the expressed&quot;needs of the U.S.S.R.SPECIFICATIONSIn order to produce and make available within the period of this Protocolthe quantities of specific items desired by the Government of the Union of soviet Socialist Republics, it is essential that specifications for such items be ofsuch a nature and be submitted within such time as to adapt themselves to united States production policies and methods. In this connection, the UnitedStates stands ready to provide all possible information and assistance to therepresentatives of the Government of &quot;the U.S.S.R.ARREARAGESIn the event of arrearages in the various items, the United States will,subject to shipping capabilities, the needs of the Soviet Government, other urgentwar requirements and feasible production schedules, give all possible considera-tion to overcoming such arrearages.
GENERALThe United States stands ready, through appropriate officials, to discuss with soviet representatives in Washington all detailed questions pertaining to theschedule of shipping and supplies and any reasonable adjustments that may be desired.It is desired to emphasize that the Government of the United States is notonly willing but is very anxious to render the assistance outlined. The SovietGovernment may rest assured that the provisions described in Articles II and Vof this Protocol will not be invoked by the Government of the United Statesunless developments definitely require it and, then only, after due consideration is given to the needs of the U.S.S.R.Above all, the United States desires again to assure the Union of soviet socialist Republics that it has a full understanding of the vital importance ofthe Soviet front and the urgent necessities of moving supplies to it in the highest possible volume and in the shortest space of time.
