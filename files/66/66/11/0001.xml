Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 11.2nd June, 1945.CABINET.FUTURE OF THE ASSYRIANS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I am anxious about the future of the Assyrians in Iraq and Syria. Mycolleagues will recall that, during the war of 1914-18, this Christian communityfrom the mountains of Eastern Turkey revolted, with Russian encouragement,against the Turkish Government, were defeated, and fled into Iraq. The post-war frontier settlement, reached as the result of a League of Nations decision and confirmed in the Treaty of Angora of 1926, placed their homelands on theTurkish side of the Turco-Iraqi frontier. The Assyrians were thereby leftstranded in Iraq, and the efforts made to settle them on the land in NorthernIraq were only partially successful. Political difficulties soon arose from the conflict between the desire of the Assyrians on the one hand for homogeneoussettlement and political autonomy and, on the other, the determination of the iraqi Government to weld together all the different racial and religious elements of the country. This conflict ended with the Assyrians&apos; attempted exodus toSyria, their fight with the Iraqi Army and the &quot;massacre&quot; of 1933. TheLeague of Nations thereafter tried for many years to find a home for the Assyriansoutside Iraq. These efforts, extending to every part of the world, were unsuccess-ful, and all tha,t was done was to settle some 9,000 Assyrians, who had crossedinto &quot;Syria in 1932-33, on the Khabur River in Northern Syria. The remainderhad to stay in Iraq.2. The events of the present war have vastly increased our obligations towards these unfortunate people. The Assyrians had for many years previously been recruited by the RAP. for the Levy forces whose duty was to defend theBritish aerodromes in Iraq. When Rashid Ali revolted and sent the IraqiArmy to attack our air base at Habbaniyah in Mayt 1941, the Assyrian unitsof the Levies stoutly defended it and afterwards took a notable part in the counter-offensive undertaken by our forces. Their loyalty to us has thus involvedthem in a second conflict with the Iraqi Army, and it is possible that after thewar, when the British forces in Iraq have been reduced to peace-time strength,some Iraqi elements may be disposed to seek a favourable opportunity for revenge.3. Since 1941, the British authorities in the Middle East have, in their efforts to deal with the shortage of man-power, greatly expanded the RAP.Levies and have, in fact, recruited almost every available Assyrian of military age in Iraq and Syria. The expanded R.A.F. Levies have served not only inIraq, but also in many other parts of the Middle East, including Syria and cyprus, and have won high praise from their British officers.4. There are at present, I understand, no outward signs in Iraq of feelingshostile to the Assyrians, but the fact that they have fought twice against the iraqi Army and that they are themselves intensely distrustful of the iraqi government makes it impossible to regard their future in Iraq with confidence.12805   [29999]
In fact, the essentials of their position have not changed, to any great extent,for the better since 1933 when, after the &quot; massacre,&quot; all concerned were agreedthat the only possible way in which the political and economic security of the assyrians could be assured was by means of resettlement in a body outside Iraq.5. The problem which I should like my colleagues to consider is this.Must our future policy be based on the assumption that the Assyrians now inIraq and Syria will have to remain where they are; or, alternatively, should a determined attempt now be made to settle them outside the Middle East 16. The first alternative, that the Assyrians in Iraq and Syria will haveto remain where they are, is certainly not a Very satisfactory solution. It means that the 20,000 Assyrians now in Iraq, to whom we undoubtedly have obligationson account of their loyal services in the Levies in the past twenty years, andparticularly on account of their gallant defence of Habbaniyah during the criticaldays of 1941, will have to remain exposed to the possibility of future conflicts withtheir Iraqi Moslem fellow citizens. It is by no means clear that we shall&apos;be ina position to afford them adequate protection in case of emergency. All that canbe done is to encourage them to become loyal and reasonably contented membersof the Iraqi nation; and this probably means that we shall have gradually to cease recruiting Assyrians for service in the R.A.F. Levies. Even if this policyproves successful, I fear that their existence in Iraq will be somewhat precariousfor many years to come. I need hardly remind my colleagues what strongcriticisms would be aroused among the friends of the Assyrians in this country if some future misfortune should overcome this Christian community, and if his Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to show that they had made reasonablyadequate arrangements for its future protection.7. As for the 9.000 Assyrians in Northern Syria, the Khabur settlement was originally only intended to be a temporary expedient, pending the establish-ment of a more permanent Assyrian home elsewhere. Now that Syria hasobtained her independence, it is impossible to feel confidence that this isolated and remote Christian settlement will continue indefinitely to exist without inter-ference from its Moslem neighbours, and it will no longer be able to look to theFrench, formerly the Mandatory Power, for protection in an emergency.8. The Assyrian Patriarch, the Mar Shimun. is now in America and isnot permitted to visit his people either in Iraq or Syria, while the Patriarchalfamily, numbering about twenty persons, is in Cyprus, maintained at the expenseof the British taxpayer, and is likewise forbidden to join the communities inIraq or in Syria.9. The alternative solution, resettlement in a body outside the Middle East,will not be easy to put into practice. The fruitless endeavours during the past ten years to find a new home for the Assyrians have shown the difficulty ofthe task. I can suggest no foreign country which would be at all likely toaccept them indeed, their very loyalty to the British cause would presumablymake them all the more unacceptable to any foreign Government. The possibilityof settling them in the conquered Italian colonies has been investigated, withnegative results; and Lord Moyne telegraphed last September his considered opinion &quot; that the proposal to settle the Assyrians in any of the former italian colonies in Africa must be definitely ruled out and that it is not worth whilecarrying out further investigation of it.&quot; The United Kingdom representatives in the Dominions have been asked whether any of the Dominion governments would be likely to agree to accept the Assyrians for settlement in a block, but all have replied that there is no possibility of these Governments doing anythingof the kind. I would see no objection to a formal approach to the DominionGovernments urging them to accept the Assyrians and offering to contribute towards the cost of their resettlement, but there is such little likelihood of afavourable reply that I do not feel that a decision on the fate of the Assyriansshould be postponed until we have the result of these enquiries. The onlyremaining hope seems to lie in the British Colonial Empire. It is true thatexhaustive enquiries made ten years ago were not promising, and I understand from the Colonial Secretary that the position in the Colonial Empire is not likelyto be any^ easier now than it was ten years ago. The difficulties of settlement in the British Colonial Empire will admittedly be very grave, and the question for decision is whether, despite these difficulties, some suitable land for thepurpose must be found there for the Assyrians; or alternatively, whether the
Assyrians, failing their acceptance by one of the Dominion Governments, willhave to remain in Iraq and Syria, in spite of the grave dangers which are tobe expected if they are left where they are.10. If my colleagues decide that some place in the British Empire mustbe found for the Assyrians, I hope that the necessary enquiries and arrangements may be made most urgently and most confidentially : the urgency of the problemlies in the fact that, until a final decision one way or the other is taken as totheir fate, it is impossible to deal with the Assyrian problem on a basis offinality. As for the need for secrecy, it is obviously undesirable that the Assyriansthemselves, or their friends in this country, should be given reason to entertainany hope that they will be removed from the Middle East, unless there is adequateground for believing that such a hope will be realised.A.
