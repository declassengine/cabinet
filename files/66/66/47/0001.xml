As a result of the discussions which took place in Washington in Aprilbetween the Ministers of Production and Food and representatives of the UnitedStates and Canadian Governments, on the subject of the supplies and require-ments for 1945 of the major food-stuffs in short supply a Memorandum of Under-standing was drawn up in which the three Governments concerned agreed to acceptsubstantial reductions in their levels of consumption as a contribution to thesolution of the grave world shortages disclosed. During the discussions theUnited Kingdom Ministers kept in touch with the representatives in Washingtonof the other Dominions and before leaving for this country gave them a resume of what had taken place.4. On his return to this country, the Minister of Food, at a meeting of theLondon Food Council (of which he is Chairman) on the 11th of May, outlined the results of the Wasbington discussions, and made an appeal to the countries represented on the Council to give urgent.consideration to the question of theadditional contributions which they might be able to make towards bridging thegaps in supplies which still remained, even after full account had been taken ofthe reductions in consumption decided upon at Washington.5. The discussions at this meeting have been followed up in communications -to the Governments of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South africa and Southern Rhodesia indicating the dimensions and urgency of the problems affecting particularly sugar, meat, oils and fats and milk products, and dealingwith particular directions in which it is hoped that individual commonwealth governments may be able further to assist.6&apos;.   Before the action referred to in the two preceding paragraphs had beentaken, the Australian Government had already announced a 12^ per cent, cut[30112] B
in the civilian meat ration (as recorded in paragraphs 29 and 30 of the Reportfor April W.P. (45) 285). The Southern Rhodesia Government had also made an offer, which was gratefully accepted, to supply 1,000 short tons of meat to the United Kingdom as a free gift, and to endeavour to make available afurther 1,000 short tons for purchase.7. The New Zealand Government telegraphed on the 31st May that theyhad on that day decided to reduce the butter ration from 8 oz. to 6 oz. a week,the estimated savings being 5,000 tons per annum, and the meat ration fromIs. dd. to Is. 6d. a week, the estimated savings being 15,000 tons per annum.The Canadian sugar ration is being reduced from 14 ib. to 9 lb. per person forthe period 1st June to 31st December, 1945.8. The meeting held in London from the 16th April to the 28th May,1945, between representatives of the United Kingdom, Australia, New zealand and the Union of South Africa to discuss wool stocks has prepared a schemefor the long-term disposal of those stocks and of current clips upon a partnershipbasis and under the control of a joint organisation. The scheme is being referredto the four Governments concerned.CANADA.9. Towards the end of May, the interests of Canadians centred largely on the two elections to be held on the 4th and the 11th June. The first, theProvincial Election in Ontario, and the second, the Canadian General Election.10, The Ontario Provincial Election was a three-cornered fight betweenthe three main parties, viz., Progressive-Conservatives with 90 candidates,Liberals 79, C.C.F. 88. The Labour-Progressives and Independents provided31 and 21 candidates respectively. The Premier, Colonel Drew, has been one ofthe Prime. Minister&apos;s bitterest critics, and has opposed Federal government action on many issues. The result of the Provincial Election was an overwhelming-victory for the Progressive-Conservative party, which gained 66 seats out of 90.The Liberal and C.C.F. leaders were both defeated.11. In the General Election, the record number of 965 candidates, including77 Servicemen, contested the 245 seats.12. In opening the Liberal campaign, the Prime Minister, Mr. mackenzie king, appealed to the people of Canada to return the Liberal Government onits past record and performance. Fie described the winning of the Japanese war as the party&apos;s principal objective, but added that the main task of the canadian government from now on will be to maintain -full employment and to providesocial security.13. The Progressive-Conservative opposition made the conscription policy the major issue. The Prime Ministers announcement that service in the Pacificwar will be on a voluntary basis, together with General McNaughton&apos;s statement that Canada does not intend to send &quot; huge &quot; numbers of men to the Pacificbrought forth a storm of protest from the Progressive-Conservatives and a savageattack by Mr. Bracken on the Government^ policy. The C.C.F. promised thattheir programme of full employment, &amp;c, would be put into effect by &quot;specialownership and control of giant monopolies, planned programmes in housing,slum clearance and regional development.&quot;14.   Of the smaller parties, the Labour-Progressives announced that theywould give their support to the Liberal candidates where they have no candidateof their own.  The Social Credit party, strong only in Alberta, promised to support&quot; any major party Avhich it felt was acting in the best interests of the country.&quot;15. For the first time since the Great War of 1914-18, organised labour in Canada took part in the election.   Subject to the possibility of recounts, thefinal results are as follows : Seats.Liberal............... 119Independent Liberal  ...       ...       ... 7Progressive-Conservative      ...       ... 65C.C.F................ 28Social Credit   ............ 13Others   ......       ......       ... 13
The Minister of Labour has announced a new policy of easing restrictions onthe grant of postponement from compulsory military service, and the suspension of all military call-ups for the Army.

The constitutional power of the Lieutenant-Governor of Prince EdwardIsland was questioned in the Provincial Legislature when the Honourable D. W.Le Page vetoed the amendment to the Prohibition Act which had been passedby the Legislature. The Premier claimed that the Lieutenant-Governor had no right to refuse assent to a Bill on his own authority, and that the power to vetoshould not be used except in cases where the constitutional legality of a Bill wasin question.   In the event, the Lieutenant-Governor has been quietly replaced.20.

The Prime Minister has again been compelled by illness to relinquishhis political work, and has been granted two months&apos; leave of absence by Parlia-ment. Prior to his illness, Mr. Curtin had been the object of intensified attacks by the press on the grounds that he was unable to control the Trade Unions, andthat he had broken his pledges not to implement the more controversial items ofthe Labour Party&apos;s programme. The United Kingdom High Commissionerreports that Mr. Chiney, Commonwealth Treasurer, has enhanced his reputationby his handling of the House during the Prime Minister&apos;s illness, and has improved his chances of being selected by his Party as Mr. CurthVs successor,should the Prime Minister find it necessary to retire.35. The Commonwealth Treasurer, Mr. Chifley, introduced a Bill providingfor a war gratuity for members of the Australian fighting forces, in accordancewith the recommendations of an all-party committee, at the rate of 755. a month for overseas service and 15.?. a month for Australian service after the outbreakof war with Japan. Where members of a family are totally dependent on a service man at his death, the minimum payment will be three years&apos; gratuity atthe oversea rate. The gratuity will become payable five years after the end ofthe war.36. A survey shows that, although Australia this year will need civilianman-power as never before, comparatively few men can be released from the armed forces. It is considered unlikely that more than 30,000 special releases can occurbefore December.37. The first Trade Delegation to visit Australia and New Zealand onbehalf of British industries since the outbreak of war is now in Canberra.Organised by the British Rayon Federation,, with the support of the Board ofTrade, its purpose is to investigate post-war prospects for trade in British rayongoods.38.

In New Guinea troops of the 6th Australian Division have capturedWewak and other Japanese strongholds in this area. During this operationelements of this Division made a successful landing 10 miles east of the town and,after advancing westward, linked up with the main forces. Further south, troops of the same Division made advances of up to 2 miles in the area East of Maprikagainst moderate opposition. Latest estimates indicated that there are nowbetween 10,000 and 12,000 Japanese troops in the Wewak area, the original enemyforce having been estimated as being in the neighbourhood of 30,000. &apos;44. In the North of Bougainville Island the 11th. Australian Brigade hasadvanced across the base of the Bonis peninsula and reached the coast near
Ruribay, thus cutting the Japanese lines of communication along the Easternseaboard and isolating the enemy forces in the peninsula; while in the Southtroops of the 3rd Australian Division have continued their advance along theBuin road and have crossed the Hongoiai River.45. On New Britain there is nothing to report beyond active patrolling bytroops of the 5th Australian Division.46.

Escorts have also been. provided for the R.N.Z.A.F. bomber-reconnaissance Squadrons which have been located in the same area.56. Three R.N.Z.A.F. Ventura bomber-reconnaissance Squadrons have operated away from New Zealand in the S.W.P.A. where they have continuedto undertake anti-submarine patrols and to participate in numerous bombing and strafing missions against enemy targets on Bougainville, New Ireland andNew Britain.57.

Concern over the housing question has been increasing with theknowledge that the South African troops will shortly be returning to the Union.On his return from a visit to Italy, the Minister of Transport, Mr. F. C. Sturrock,said that the housing problem was the main anxiety of the soldiers. As theresult of a heated exchange between the former director of housing andMr. Lawrence, Minister of Welfare and Demobilisation, a drastic housing bill has now been introduced by the latter into Parliament. Mr. Lawrence&apos;s action has met with approval in Government circles, although it is felt that his Billis only tolerable under the present wholly abnormal circumstances.63. During the Vote on demobilisation in the House of Assembly, theMinister of Welfare and Demobilisation, Mr. Lawrence, said that it was estimatedthat about 60,000 persons now on active service would not have any pre-war jobsto which to return. Government Departments would be able to absorb about11.000.64. The National Executive Committee of the South African Labour party has notified its branches throughout the Union to hold themselves in readiness for a special conference at the end of the- present Parliamentary session, toconsider the question of Labour&apos;s continued collaboration with the Government.Although there is a growing restlessness in the Labour Party, the pact with theUnited Party may not be terminated before the end of the Japanese war.65.   Provision has been made in the 1945-46 estimates for three major airports at Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town, at a total cost of  500,000.66. In the elections in South-West Africa, the United Party won all twelveseats in a straight fight with the Nationalists. The results are regarded as anendorsement of General Smuts&apos;s war policy, and of his intention, announced at san Francisco, to apply for the termination of the mandate and the incorporation of the territory of the Union. One of the main planks in the United Party&apos;splatform was a project to repatriate all enemy aliens except those who could show before an impartial commission that they were entitled, by their actionsduring the war, to remain in South-West Africa.67. At a meeting, held recently in Cape Town, of the leaders of theNationalist Party and editors of the Nationalist newspapers, to discuss the line the Nationalist Party and Press should take in the event of friction between theUnited Kingdom and Russia, the general feeling was that support should begiven to the United Kingdom.68.   Dr. van Rensburg, the leader of the &quot; Ossewa Brandwag,&quot; has goneout of his way to praise Hitler as a hero.   This has served to remind south africans that the organisation, with its declared Fascist policy, still exists.   A    \,further reminder that the Government emergency regulations cannot yet be    Jrevoked came on V.E. Day when subversive elements raided the office of the ChiefController at Pretoria after overpowering the Guard.
69. A new Ocean Mail Service contract between the Union Governmentand the Union Castle Mail Steamship Company has been signed. It is to be effective for 10 years, from the 1st January, 1947.

No political developments of importance were reported from india during May. Political circles still awaited the results of Lord Wavelbs visit toLondon, though its prolonged duration and the events attending the terminationof the Coalition Government diminished the earlier expectations that some radicaladvance was contemplated by His Majesty&apos;s Government.92. The end of the war with Germany was widely celebrated, though reportssuggest that it was regarded with mixed feelings by the large section of thepopulation to which the war has meant a season of unexampled prosperity.
Foreign and Frontier-Relations.France.93. The French Government recently proposed an exchange of representa-tiveswith India on the same lines as the recent exchanges of representativesbetween France and Australia, and between America and India. The Governmentof India, who have been consulted, consider that the present is not an opportunetime for such an exchange, and have pointed out that, in any case, under thepresent Constitution the representatives could not enjoy full diplomatic status.The terms of the reply to be returned to the French were still under consideration-tion by the Foreign Office at the end of May.Afghanistan.94. His Majesty&apos;s Minister reported general relief at the end of the warin Europe, but added that it was tempered by sympathy with Germany and increasing fear of Russia.95.

Visit of Indian Industrialists. A party of prominent Indian indus-industrialists, of whom the most important members are Mr. J. R. D. Tata andMr. G. D. Birla, arrived in the United Kingdom in May. They are travelling as individuals at their own expense, but are being given travel and other facilitiesby the Government of India and His Majesty&apos;s Government. They plan to goon to the United States and Canada at the end of June and probably will returnto the United Kingdom on their way back to India. Their overt purpose is merely to see the industrial developments which have taken place outside india during the war, but it is hoped that some of them at least will carry further negotiations for the placing of orders for equipment for the post-war expansionof Indian industry and possibly discuss arrangements with United Kingdomindustrialists regarding the way in which they can assist and possibly participate in such expansion.99. The Commercial Safeguards. Sir Ardeshir Dalai, the member of theGovernor-General&apos;s Executive Council for Planning and Development, alsoarrived in the United Kingdom in connection with a visit to this country andthe United States. The main purpose of his visit was to take up with ElisMa,jesty&apos;s Government the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935,which prevent discrimination in India against United Kingdom commercial interests. It was decided that it was impossible to discuss this very controversialmatter with Sir A. Dalai in detail on account of the General Election, and thatin any case it would not be possible to sweep away the safeguards until there hasbeen established in India an autonomous and representative Indian Governmentwith which a Treaty regulating these matters could be negotiated[30112] c
A rmy, Navy and A ir Force A activities.Royal Indian Navy.100. H.M.S. Burnet was turned over to the Royal Indian Navy and recom-missioned as H.M.I.S. Gondwana on the 15th May.101. H.M.I.S. Sutlej and Cauvery supported the Naval Force which took part in the operations leading to the capture of Rangoon.102. 37th M/S Flotilla, which is composed of Fleet Minesweepers andTrawlers of the Royal Indian Navy were responsible for Minesweeping operationsnecessary to clear the approaches to the port.103. Coastal Force craft have continued operations to a limited extent onthe Arakan and Burma Coast.104. All navigation lights on the East Coast of India west of 900 E. havebeen illuminated with peace-time characteristics.M ilitary.Burma.105. 15th Indian Corps. On the 1st May Paratroops were dropped atElephant Point. On the 2nd May landings were made on both banks of theRangoon river by troops of the 26th Indian Division. Rangoon was occupied onthe 3rd May.106. Subsequently troops advancing N.E. and N.W. from Rangoon linked up with 14th Army troops moving South from Pegu and 15th Indian Corpstroops moving S.E. from Prome. This had the effect of dividing Burma into three sectors. In the Western sector Japanese troops facing the West AfricanDivision in Arakan thus had their escape route cut, while in the Central sector14th Army troops were astride the withdrawal routes of all the Japanese locatedbetween the Prome-Rangoon and Mandalay-Rangoon railways.107. The monsoon broke over Burma in the latter part of May. This hasgradually bogged down the operations to wipe out the enemy forces mentionedabove, who continue to fight desperately to escape eastwards. The monsoon is a two-edged weapon. On the one hand it will slow up our operations to destroy theenemy, on the other it will combine with our troops to make the Japanese escape from Burma a desperate venture.108. The Japanese east of the Mandalay-Rangoon railway showed greatdetermination in their efforts to hold a line across their escape routes into the hillseast of the railway, and so southwards towards Moulmein.A ir.109. Air Supply to the Army in Burma continued to be made on thelargest sustained scale known to any theatre of operations.110. Moulmein and Mergui were bombed by Liberators on several occasionsduring the month.Ill, With the advent of the monsoon adverse flying conditions restrictedoperations by Eastern Air Command.General.112. Recovered Prisoners of War. 955 British and Indian prisoners ofwar were recovered at Pegu and Rangoon.   They were in fair physical condition.113. 12,200 Prisoners of war from Germany have arrived in the UnitedKingdom, and 3,000 are being returned to India via Italy.114. Repatriation. The repatriation of B.O.R.&apos;s of British and Indianunits is now working out at just over 3 years, 8 months.115. Morale. This was raised to a very high level by the victory in europe and successes in Burma. Victory celebrations were thought to be prematurebefore the end of the war with Japan and evoked little response in India.116. British troops have been optimistically speculating that VE-day willconsiderably hasten release or repatriation. Indian troops, on the other hand,mostly regard the release scheme as the end of attractive employment rather thanthe opportunity to return to civil life and a probably lower standard of living.
BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.117. Enemy-occupied Burma. There are no important developments toreport.118. Liberated Burma. Well-armed dacoits continue to abound in liberated areas and Civil Police numbers are inadequate. Armed Civil police are contemplated for internal security and Chinese frontier control. Ill-feeling between Karens and Burmese is widespread.119. Relief supplies to the value of Rs.1,80,000 were sold at 42 distributingareas during April. Movement of supplies has been limited by inadequate road and air transport.120. Mandalay and Meiktila Irrigation Works are intact. Large quantitiesof seeds are entering Burma and many agricultural seed farms have continuedto function in a small way during the occupation.121. The circulation of the C.A.S. (B) newspaper has risen from 10,000 to30,000. The Upper Burma Publicity Branch has taken over a printing press andis distributing^ Burmese news-sheet. Two publicity officers are investigating the printing press and paper situation in Rangoon. Pending formal instructionsschools are being reopened on a temporary basis with salvaged and improvisedmaterials.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic A ffairs.Food Supplies.Ceylon.122. Thanks to the efforts of the Minister of Food and also the Ministerof War Transport, prospects of keeping Ceylon supplied with sufficient riceto maintain the present ration throughout the second half of this year are certainly brighter.123. Further quantities of rice are being made available to Ceylon from egypt and Brazil: (a) owing to a reduction of 15,000 tons in the Army Middle East demand;(b) by the Government of India agreeing to postpone repayment of loan of 25,000 tons till end of this year;(c) by shipments out of surplus from the Brazilian crop.124. These allocations, however, will not be sufficient to cover Ceyloirsneeds for the whole of the second six months, and an approach has therefore been made to the Government of India for a further 25,000 tons. The releaseof this quantity, which is contingent on wheat supplies to India, is now beingearnestly considered, and it is hoped that a decision will soon be reached.125. A recent report from the Governor indicates that owing to damageby drought the Maha and Yala rice crops in Ceylon will be seriously reduced.A further report on the situation is expected, but present, indications are thatthe collection of paddy during the current year may be at least 25 per cent,lower than last year.126. Ceylon&apos;s import of wheat and flour for the second half of this year has been approved by the Ministry of Food and Ministry of War Transport atthe rate of 22,000 tons per month, which compares with the previous figure of18,500 tons per month. This requirement has been programmed on the basisof shipment from North/South America.[30112] d
East Africa.127. The Governor has reported that the continued failure of the rainsin most of the producing areas of East Africa is having a very serious effecton crop prospects.126. For the period up to end of September 1945 when new crops normallybecome available for consumption, Kenya has notified substantial increases infamine relief requirements. Both Uganda and Tanganyika have also indicated that they will require to import cereals.129. The supply position from March to. September 1946 will depend onoutcome of October rains, but present indications are that food importations arelikely to be required this year from November onwards to meet the deficiency,the extent of which cannot yet be ascertained.Trade with Palestine.130. Two Trade Delegations from Palestine, one Arab and the otherJewish, have been in this country since early in April investigating supplypossibilities and generally reviving old trade contacts and making new ones. Ithad been hoped to arrange for one joint delegation, but the efforts of the palestine government in that direction failed owing to the refusal of the Arabs and Jews to combine even in a purely trade visit of this kind. Although thePalestine Government assisted in the arrangements for these visits, the delega-tions are in no sense official and are merely representative of various industrial and commercial organisations and interests in Palestine.131. The delegations have discussed supply and shipping matters with departments, and through the good offices of the Department of Overseas Trade,have been brought in touch with export groups, manufacturers&apos; associations and individual manufacturers and merchants, both in London and the provinces.These various talks have been conducted separately for the two Delegations, a shave also the various social functions arranged by the Government HospitalityFund and the Ministry of Information. An attempt by the British Councilto give a joint entertainment to the two Delegations was defeated by thecategorical refusal of the Arabs to attend any function at which the Jewishdelegates were to be present.132. Both Delegations expressed themselves as satisfied with the results oftheir visits, which should be coming to an end shortly, and although they are clearly unable to return to Palestine with firm assurances that all their require-ments will be met from the United Kingdom, they will return with a very muchmore realistic and up-to-date appreciation of the supply position in this countryand with the reasonable expectation that a not inconsiderable part of their needswill be forthcoming from this country. They also appear to be pleased with thetreatment they have received here, both from officials and from individual and commercial firms, and I am certain that, quite apart from the material benefits which might flow- from these visits, the general benefits resulting from thesefriendly personal contacts with officials and merchants here should prove of mutual advantage to Palestine and this country.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.133. The Jewish celebrations of V-Day took the form of ebullitions of nationalist sentiment. In Tel Aviv few flags save the Zionist blue and white andoccasional red banners were in evidence.134. There has been some recrudescence of terrorism and spasmodic attempts at sabotage. An attempt to attack the Police Mobile Force Camp at Sarona by home-made mortar fire miscarried on the night of the 13th May. Two nights later,four mortar bombs fell outside Sarona perimeter and two&apos; near Police Head-quarters near Jaffa. There has been some sabotage of telegraph poles, and the:oil pipeline was damaged in two places by explosives on the night of the 22nd May.On the night of the 25th May, a police patrol fired on unknown persons in anorange grove near Sarona Camp. Fire was returned, and two mortars loaded with incendiary bomb projectiles were subsequently found in the grove. On the night of the 13th May, a truck containing mortars, detonators, explosives and anti-personnel bombs, together with four suspects, were handed over to the policeby members of Kafr Hassidim Settlement.   There have been no casualties.
135. Police anti-terrorist measures continue. Forty-two persons weredetained and considerable seizures of explosives were made.136. The fate and whereabouts of the Mufti have been the subject offrequent rumours and widespread interest. He is still accepted as symbolical of arab nationalism.137. A general strike was proclaimed among the Arab community on the22nd May in sympathy with the Levant States, whose dispute with France is represented as an Arab struggle against imperialism.1&quot;rans-Jordan.138. V-Day was celebrated in Transjordan with more genuine andspontaneous feelings of relief and gratitude than were apparent in Palestine, and pro--British sentiments were well to the fore.139. On the 18th May, the Prime Minister, Samir Pasha Rif ai, precipitatelyresigned on a personal issue. Ibrahim Pasha Hashim replaced Samir Pasha as prime Minister, with Tewfik Abul Huda as a member of the Cabinet.140. On the 22nd May, the Amir met the Regent of Iraq and Nuri PashaEs Said at Lydda airport.141. The inhabitants of Amman and other towns in Transjordan closed thebazaar in sympathy with the Levant States. This was the hrst politicaldemonstration since the beginning of the war and hence significant as the apparent end of the self-imposed truce on political activities observed inTrans Jordan during the past year.Bermuda.142. Lord Burghley, the Governor of the Colony, has been in this country on a short visit to discuss matters of local interest, particularly in regard toaviation and post-war trade development.Trinidad.143. Sir Bede Clifford, the Governor, has arrived in this country on leave and is discussing various questions arising out of the United States BasesAgreement, constitutional and air matters. &apos;
