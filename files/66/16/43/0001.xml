P.(41) 114),  the Secretary of State for War draws attentionto the importance of removing Italian prisoners of war fromthe Middle East and East Africa in order to reduce to theminimum the calls on military units in those territories.2C.      At the P^ime ministers request I have considered, inconsultation with the Ministers primarily concerned, whether itwould he possible to bring something like 25,000 of these Italiansbo this country to work in organised mobile gangs upon the land.(This would be an extension&apos;of the scheme approved by the WarCabinet on the 16th January,  1941,  (w. M. (41) 7th Conclusions,.Minute 8) when authority was given for 2,000 to 3,000 suitableNorth Italians to be brought here for urgent land reclamationwork,)30      The most serious difficulty in giving effect to ascheme on these lines arises from transport.    There is nodifficulty in finding room in the returning ships to bringprisoners and their guards to this, country at a rate which isnot likely to exceed 5,000 a month.    The  guards, who would befound from the Middle East garrison,might be Indian State troopsor might be British troops.    The difficulty arises from the factthat these guards on their return journey to the Middle east would take up shipping space which would be otherwise availablefor reinforcements sent out from this country.    The space inoutgoing convoys is already more than fully hypothecated to draftsand reinforcements upon which the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East,is already counting.    To ease this  difficulty we suggest that thenormal scale of one guard to  every ten prisoners could bereduced, provided that arrangements are made for additional guardsto be provided locally at every port at which these ships.may callon their return journey to this country.    Even so the arrangementsmade will involve somo   depletion of the forces in the middle east and it will be for the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to s&amp;ywhether he can afforu This l^ss.

o r o^ j o4.      To enable 25.000 prisoners of war to be employedunder proper security conditions on agricultural work, theWar Office estimate that they would have to find between &apos;   -6,000 and 7,000 soldiers for guards and administrative services.      At first sight this would seem to impose an undue strain on army man-power.    But the personnel requiredfor these duties could be drawn from sections of the pioneer Gorps engaged on work which might be done by italian prisoners of war.    Any loss of man-power from thearmy could, therefore,  be avoided if, for every group of italian prisoners of war assigned to agriculture, there wereallocated to the army for employment on military works,which would ordinarily be carried out by Pioneers, a numberof Italian prisoners who would free military personnel toact as guards and administrative services both for prisonersso assigned to agriculture and to the various military requirements.5.      The War Office could also use a number of italian prisoners of war as technical tradesmen in ordnance works.They would be concentrated in prisoner of war workshops,and would not be used in forward areas or to work on tanks and guns.    A number of Italians could also be used in the orkneys,  to free Irish labour.6.      The exact allocation of Italian prisoners of war between agricultural work and work under the War Officeneed not be settled at this moment.    We are satisfied,however, that work could be found for 25,000 italian prisoners.    When arrangements to bring this number over havebeen completed,  the position should be reviewed.7.      So long as the prisoners are employed in gangsunder reasonable guard no objection will be raised on security grounds to a scheme on these lines.80      We suggest that the Secretary of State for war should be authorised to proceed with a scheme on ohese. lines,subject to any comments which may be received from theCommander-in-chief, Middle EastaJo AoPrivy Council Office.
