THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,Printed for the War Cabinet.  May 1941.SECRET. Copy No,W.P. (41) 116.May 27, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.OUR KRAB POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Prime Minister has asked that our Arab policy should now be recon-sidered. The present moment is opportune for such a stock-taking. We are facedwith the necessity for taking decisions of the utmost importance relating to thefuture of Syria. Our decisions must fall within the framework of the widerpolicy which we wish to adopt towards the whole Arab world.2. In our Arab policy, the Palestine problem has hitherto been, and willin the future remain, a weighty factor. We must face the fact that the policy we have pursued in Palestine and its attendant differences with Arabs have hada serious effect upon Arab opinion. It was as a result of developments inPalestine that the Mufti and his supporters established themselves first in Syria,,then in Iraq. These fanatical anti-British agitators have largely influenced Iraqiopinion, have stirred up anti-British feeling, and have been able to reinforce the extreme nationalist school of politics now strong in Iraq. The Palestinequestion has, in fact, facilitated the present rebellion of the Iraqi militaryleaders, which is directed against our position in the Middle East.3. I am not now asking for a reconsideration of the Palestine problem. Imerely recall the fact*that this question is unhappily a part, and a vitally important part, of the Arab problem. I should welcome, in due course, a decisionto take the next steps to give effect to the Palestine White Paper. But I do not ask for this now. In present conditions it could have no decisive effect insatisfying Arab opinion.   The Germans&apos; could always offer more.4. It is in respect of Syria that decisions are immediately required. i recommend that the Free French should be given a chance to win over Syria toour side. Should it once become clear either that the Free French are unwilling to make a declaration promising Syria and the Lebanon their independence, or that such a declaration, when made, is not going to bring Syria over to us, weshould hold ourselves free to turn from the Free French towards the SyrianArabs. We should then ourselves make a declaration promising Syria indepen-dence.  This might well be timed to harmonise with a British advance into Syria.5. There should not be insuperable difficulties about setting up an indepen-dent Arab Government in Syria, the machinery for which already exists in large part. Such a State could not stand alone, and its independence would presumablyhave to be guaranteed by its neighbours, Great Britain and Turkey.6. Turkey has a special interest in Syria owing to the fact that Turkishrailway communications pass through Aleppo. There is much to be said for thewhole of this railway, including Aleppo, coming under Turkish sovereignty.11388   [22561]
7. We may therefore have to consider very shortly whether or not we are toencourage the Turks to invade Syria and seize Aleppo. The fact that Aleppo isnow being used by the German Air Force makes such a step far more desirablefrom our point of view, and far more risky from the Turkish point of view. ButAleppo is considered of great importance by the Arabs, and any encouragementgiven to the Turks by us to establish themselves in Aleppo would seriously alienateArab opinion. On the whole, I feel that in this matter our war necessities mustprevail and that, assuming the Free French cannot bring Syria over,- neither ourco-operation with them, nor our desire for Arab goodwill, should weigh in thescale against action by the Turks to take Aleppo, if they can be induced to take such action. The chances of the Turks agreeing to take such action would be enhanced if we had entered Bagdad and were ourselves clearly about to takestrong action in Syria.8. In Iraq our immediate policy seems clear enough : to drive out RashidAli and set up a friendly Government. If this can be done, it is difficult to see what more we can do for Iraq than we have done already. We ought, however,to promote a system under which the Shiah majority in the country would have more say in its government.9. For Saudi Arabia, our policy must be to continue to support Ibn Saud,and to give him the subsidies of which he stands in need.10. A question for consideration is whether we can devise, and continuouslywork for, some wider objective, for example, the Arab federation which so manyArabs profess to desire. Many people have suggested that the only practical solution of the Palestine problem would be a federation of Middle Eastern States,in which a Jewish State should have a place as one of the component units. Wehave never opposed such a federation. Our attitude has been that it is for theArabs to decide what they want. I fear, however, that an Arab federation isnot at the moment practical politics. Dynastic rivalries, between Ibn Saud on theone hand, and the royal family of Iraq and Trans Jordan on the other, would render it impracticable and unprofitable to attempt to work out any definite scheme of federation. There would be other difficulties, too, for Iraq has always consideredthat Bagdad should play the leading part in any such federation, whereas thereare few Arabs outside Iraq who would accept this view. Nevertheless, Arabsgenerally agree that some form of &quot;Arab federation&quot; is desirable, and I thinkthat we should not only refrain from opposing such vague aspirations, but eventake every opportunity of expressing publicly our support for them.11.   My recommendations then would be : (a) Palestine.   No change.(b) Syria.   If the Free French can do nothing, we should declare ourselves in favour of Syrian independence.  As regards North Syria, we should,&quot;  in default of a Free French occupation, promote, if possible, theoccupation of Aleppo by the Turks.(c)Iraq.    Establishment of  a  friendly  Government,  which  should  be encouraged to aim at a polity more in accord with local conditions.(d) Saudi Arabia.   Continuation of our support.(e) Public support of the idea of Arab federation, the terms of which itmust be left to the Arabs to work out.A. E.Foreign Office,May 27, 1941.
