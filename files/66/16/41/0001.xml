TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.240BUi&apos;6 Lie secceey of this document.This document is the property of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.If the Germans occupy Cyprus, a probable move on their part will &quot;be to represent themselves as liberators whointend to hand over the Island to Greece, or rather to theQuisling Government which they have set up in Athens.   Itwould therefore be prudent at once to consider what our attitude should be in such an eventuality in order not to betaken unawares.- 2.   The problem should be considered in the light ofthe fact that, quite apart from the necessities of thepresent crisis, there is a strong prima facie case for cedingCyprus to Greece,   subject to safeguards, after the war.This emerges clearly from a memorandum recently prepared atthe.request of the Foreign Office by the Foreign research department of the Royal Institute of International Affairs.This memorandum which forms the annex to this paper recallsthat England.occupied Cyprus in 1878 to enable her to guardSECRET.WPUO 118May 31st, 1941.WAR CABINET.FUTURE OF CYPRUS.against

O It iagainst an emergency, namely Russian penetration into theValleys of the Tigris and the Euphrates, which nevermaterialised-    that since Cyprus became a British colony in1925 the Island, except in the purely negative sense thatit has been denied, to any other Great Power, has made no contribution to the security of British Imperial interests;that it was offered to Greece in 1915 as a means of inducingher to enter the war on the side of the Entente;   and thatsome four-fifths of the population of the Island are Greekspeaking orthodox Christians, whose already fervent desire for union with Greece may grow rather than diminish,     Thememorandum further shows that, apart from strategic considerations, the only material obstacles to the cession of the Island to Greece are (1) the stipulation in theSykes-Picot agreement of 1916, confirmed by article U of the franco-British Convention of 1920, to the effect that france should have n veto on the cession of the Island to a thirdPower, and (2) the interests of Turkey in the Island on strategic grounds and in respect of the Turkish speakingminority.     The first of these obstacles can hardly he regarded as serious in present circumstances when France is rapidly losing her position in Syria.     As regards thesecond obstacle, it ought to be possible to devise safeguardsto secure Turkey&apos;s strategic interests, and to solve theproblem of the Turkish minority by transfer of population.

As for the strategic interests of Great Britain, these would. of course have to he preserved, and this could probably bedone by the cession to Great Britain of naval or air bases in Cyprus or another Greek island, e.g. Crete, or in the dodecanese.3.    To meet the- eventuality referred to in paragraph 1of this paper the following courses are open to us :-(i) We might more or less ignore the matter and let the German propaganda do its worst, in the confidenthope that the Greek people will not be taken in by it.(ii) We might anticipate this German move by at oncemaking a public statement to the effect&quot; that after thewar we intend to discuss with the Greek Government theconditions under which we would he ready to cede the island to Greece.     (These conditions would presumablyhave for their object the retention by ourselves of thenecessary naval and air bases in the Island, or the cession of bases elsewhere - see paragraph 2 above).(iii) We might at once without waiting for any Germanmove take the Greek Government into our confidence and consult them as to what line we should both take to counter this possible German move.     We should try to persuade the Greek Government that in the event of theGermans making their offer and the Quisling Government inAthens accepting it, they should repudiate the latter&apos;acceptance and state that they refused to consider any scheme which involved Greece receiving Cyprus at the harWsof Germany.

It-,    As regards (i), this is the line of leastresistance.   But could we really maintain such a policy ofsilence?     Should we not be forced into a dangerously falseposition which would embarrass not merely ourselves hut alsothe Greek Government?     However much the Greek people maydislike and suspect the Germans, they would be more thanhuman if they did not welcome this offer and use itsubsequently against ourselves..    In any case, it would make,for the time being, admirable material for German propaganda,not only in Greece but in the Greek colony in Alexandria and elsewhere.     Incidentally,, it would he represented that wewere defending Cyprus for purely selfish motives because we wished to preserve it as -a British colony.   Moreover if wekept silent it would not follow ,that the Greek Governmentwould he able to do so, since they would have to consider how best to preserve their authority over the Greek people in competition with the Quisling Government which is operating in Athens, and they might well feel that the only way forthem to do this would be by giving out a rival statement.50    As regards (ii), when I was recently in Athens I was asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to announce now their decision to cede the Island after the war.I -deprecated discussion of the question in condition which thenexisted.     It might therefore seem inconsistent now to come forward with a definite offer.     But quite apart from that,to the world at large it would look like an act of panic onour part to offer Cyprus to Greece at the present moment and inpresent .. ..

5-present circumstances.     Moreover, we should &quot;be makingour offer before the Germans had made theirs, and we shouldbe rather hoist with our own petard if, as it turned out, theGermans never had any intention of making their offer.6.    There remains course (iii), i-.e. to take up thematter at once with the Greek Government on the lines ofproposing that they should repudiate any German offer of Cyprus,if and when made.     It may be difficult to pursue, this course to a satisfactory conclusion, but I feel that it is the onewhich we ought at any rate to explore.7.    In order to induce the Greek Government to repudiate a German offer publicly we should probably haveto allow them to say publicly that they intend to discussthe problem of Cyprus&apos;s future with His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin due course.   Even so the Greek Government might feel that,having regard to the strength of Greek public opinionon the subject, they must be able to say something more definite than this.   If so, we might have to agree that ifthe Greek Government would repudiate the German offer, if and when made, we, for our part, would agree to a joint state-.ment to the effect that our two Governments were already agreed to discuss conditions under which the sovereignty ofthe Island should, after the war, be transferred from GreatBritain to Greece.   I realise thai this would be open to thesame objections&apos; as course (ii) j I. e; we sHould appear to be acting Inconsistently and under panic..   But ori the whole itmight....

might be&apos; worth while in present circumstances to risk theseaccusations, especially in view of the considerations advanced in paragraph 2 above.8ft   Conclusion.That we should at once take the Greek Government into our confidence and consult them as to the line which vie should adopting the event of the Germans occupying Cyprus and declaringtheir intention.of handing it over to the Quisling government at Athens;That we should try to persuade the Greek Government that,in the event of the Germans making their offer and the Quisling   3Government in Athens accepting it, they should repudiate thelatter&apos;s acceptance and state that they refused to consider any scheme which involved Greece receiving Cyprus at the handsof the Germans;That, if the Greek Government agreed to this, we shouldbe prepared to&apos;allow them to say publicly that they intend todiscuss the problem of Cyprus&apos;s future with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in due course, andthat if pressed by the Greek Government we should beprepared to agree to a joint statement to the effect that our two Governments were already agreed to discuss conditions under which the sovereignty of the Island should, after thewar, be transferred from Great Britain to Greece.FOREIGN OFFICE,May&apos;31st, 19U.

ANNEX,CYPRUS,1.    The island of Cyprus was assigned &quot;to be occupied andadministered by England&quot;, under the Anglo-Turkish Convention ofthe ipfch June 1878, in return for an undertaking to join in thedefence of the Sultan1s remaining Asiatic territories in the eventof any future Russian attack upon them.    The prevention of Russianpenetration into the valleys of the Tigris and the Euphrates wasa British as well as an Ottoman interest, and the Russian occupationof Qars and Ardahan with her claim to Batum, all of which, as her majesty&apos;s Government foresaw at the time of the Cyprus Convention,were accepted by the Congress of Berlin, brought the dangerappreciably nearer.    Lord Beaconsfield had accordingly called forreports on the possibility of acquiring some base from which furtherRussian expansion might be effectively counteracted.    Among the sites suggested by his advisers were liuhammerah at the head of thePersian Gulf, Stampalia in the Aegean, and Alexandretta;    but theGovernments choice fell upon Cyprus.It would seem that, for the purpose of operating against a russian army based on Armenia,, both Cyprus^, and Alexandretta were at that time less favourably situated that&apos;a position either on theShatt-al-Arab or closer to the Dardanelles;  and that Cyprus offeredfewer advantages than Alexandretta.    But- there were other considerations which favoured a site in the Eastern Mediterranean:    since theopening of the Suez Canal, nine years previously, the lack of aBritish base nearer to its northern outlet than Malta had been felt as a weakness;    and considerable attention was being paid to projuo&apos;;for a Euphrates Valley railway, to be constructed by Britishcajoital, from Alexandretta or some neighbouring point on the coast ofnorthern Syria to the Persian Gulf.    It was anticipated that the possession of either Alexandretta or Cyprus would go far to giveGreat Britain the effective control of both the existing and the projected short route to India, while the building of the railwaywould add greatly to the value of either base as a check on Russia.Finally, the rejection of Alexandretta was dictated largely by thereaslisation of the repercussions which its occupation was likely tohave upon Anglo-French relations.2.    Great Britain retained Cyprus under the terms of the 1878Convention for a little over thirty-six years.    During that period,the emergency in foresight of which the island had been occupied didnot arise;    the Baghdad Railway, with which Alexandretta was linkedin 191^-? was built under German and not under British influence; andthe protection of the Suez Canal was far more effectively assured bythe occupation of Egypt in 1882.    By 191U5 therefore, the control of-Cyprus had not conferred upon Great Britain any of those advantages which had been anticipated at the time of its occupation.    TheAdmiralty indeed had opposed the occupation in 1878, and in November1912 Sir Edward Grey had told the Italian Ambassador that Cyprus was&quot;of now use as a naval base&quot;, and that the naval authorities were constantly pressing for a base in the Aegean Islands.It was thus possible, In October 1915? to offer the island(which had been annexed when Turkey entered the war)  to Greece, asa means of inducing her to engage in hostilities on the side of theEntente.    Only the unwillingness of the Greek Government to enter the war averted the withdrawal of Great Britain from Cyprusat that time. AfterAffairs.

9 ,\ 7After the Peace Treaties of 1919-23, Great Britain&apos;sipir-ategic position in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Persian Gulfwas vastly stronger than it had been in 1878.    Not only was Egyptstill in British handsi but Russia had withdrawn from Qars andArdahan, while Britain was herself established as a mandatoryPower in   Iraq, Trans Jordan and Palestine,      Both France and Italy,it is true, had in the interval acquired footholds in the easternbasin of the Mediterranean, but the creation of a British sphere of influence stretching from the Libyan desert to the frontier&apos;of Iran was more than sufficient to redress the strategic balance.In these circumstarioes,  the. positive contribution whichCyprus could make to the security of British imperial interestswas not substantial.    Negatively, however,  it was desirable thatCyprus should not be controlled by another Great Power, and this possibility would have been brought nearer, but for the previousBritish occupation, by the final dismemberment of the ottoman empire.    A second factor tending to enhance the value of Cyprusin the. period following the war of 1914-18 was the developementof aviation,.for the island is topographically better adapted for the construction of an air base than of a naval harbour.3.      Sovereignty over Cyprus was formally transferred to GreatBritain by Article 20 of the Treaty of Lausanne,  and the island was given the status of a British Colony in 1925.    There still remained, however,  one restriction upon the freedom of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to dispose of Cyprus.    The French Governmenthad secured the insertion into the &quot;Sykes-Picot Agreement&apos;1 of1916 of a stipulation, presumably intended to prevent theestablishment of an Italian base in face of Alexandretta,  to theeffect that France should have a veto upon the cession of cyprus to a third Power.    This undertaking was confirmed by Article 4of the Franco-British Convention of the 23rd December 1920,&apos; whichran as follows:&quot;In virtue of the geographic and strategic positionof the island of Cyprus,  off the Gulf of Alexandretta,the British Government agrees not to open any negotationsfor the cession or alienation of the said island of Cyprus without the previous consent of the FrenchGovernment&quot;.4.      Another Government which, despite its lack of juridicalstatus in the matter, has followed the fortunes of Cyprus withclose attention is that of Greece.    Of the total population ofthe island - 348,000 at&apos;the census of 1931 - some four fifthsare Greek-speaking Orthodox    Christians (the bulk of the remainderbeing Turkish-speaking Moslems).,    And the nationalist aspirations of modern Greece have been shared,  since 1821 at least, by an increasing number of Greek-speaking Cypriots.    At the presenttime,  the desire for the union with Greece is felt by the greatmajority of Greok priests,  school-teachers and lawyers,  and bythe larger part of the Greek population of the towns, while itis probably&quot;making headway in the rural districts.Between 1878 and 1914 unionist feeling was not a factor off first-class importance in the politics of Cyprus.    Since Turkeyhad not divested herself of suzerainty over the island,  theBritish Administration could not be held responsible for its continuedseparation from Greece.    The situation, furthermore, was in some respects similar to that of the Ionian Islands between 1815&apos;and 1864,when a British Protectorate over Greek islands which had previouslyformed part of the Venetian Empire had been terminated by theircession to Greece.    But when Great Britain,  so far from relinquishingCyprus, asserted and confirmed her sovereignty over it,  the demand for self-determination became more insistent and more popular.    For manyyears unionist agitation was treated with great tolerance by theBritish authorities; until 1929,  for instance,  the elementary schoolswere openly used by the Greek nationalists as instruments of propaganda.      This policy of toleration was sharply reversed, after a sudden/

sudden outbreak of popular violence in October 1931.    TheLegislative Council was then abolished, and Cyprus has since been(&quot;Culed by the Governor with the assistance of an ExecutiveCouncil consisting mainly of officials.The Turkish-speaking minority - 61+,000 at the census of1931 - is on the whole content with the existing regime, and wouldview with apprehension the realisation of Greek hopes.5*  In considering the future of Cyprus after the present war,it is necessary to take into account the following factors:(a) the strategic requirements of His Majesty1 s Government.The bearing of the situation in Cyprus upon this interestswill depend upon developments in the Eastern Mediterraneangenerally, and the following paragraphs must therefore bebased on certain assumptions as to the British positionelsewhere.    It will be assumed that the air base at AbuSueir remains in British hands, and that Great Britainretains a naval base within a short distance of Port Said,either by the maintenance of the arrangements which permit the use of Alexandria or by the substitution for it of Haifa;(b) the desires and interests of the inhabitants, and theinterests of Greece and Turkey so far as they are involved by this factor;(c) the strategic interests of Turkey; and(d) the commitment to Prance of the 23rd December 1920, inso far as it will be possible,when the war is over, to regard this commitment as valid,In the light of these considerations, there appear to be four policies which it might be possible for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to adopt,(a) to maintain the status quo;  -(b) to retain their sovereignty over the island, whilegranting certain rights or facilities to one or more interested Powers:(c) to cede the island to Greece upon conditions designedeither to safeguard existing British strategic advantagesor to obtain compensation elsewhere;  or(d) to cede the island, without such safeguards or compensation, either in return for guarantees as to its use by Greece in the future or     conditionally.6. The strongest argument for the first alternative, that of/preserving the status quo, is that the effective and permanentoccupation of Cyprus by Great Britain is the surest guaranteeI against the eventuality of its use by a hostile Power or\combination of Powers.    Furthermore, Cyprus is the only territory under British sovereignty in the Eastern Mediterranean. Lastlyit has been claimed (contrary to the unfavourable opinions expressed by the Admiralty in 1878 and subsequently) thatPamagusta is capable of development as a naval base; and thedevelopment of aerial warfare has altered the relative importance of Mediterranean islands, in particular by introducing a need for flat ground suitable for conversion into an airfield.In this respect Cyprus is superior to certain smaller islandswhich might previously have been preferred to it because of theirmore promising harbours.  If however the assumption mentioned in theprevious paragraph (the maintenance of British bases at Abu Sueirand

and either Alexandria or Haifa) he accepted, these last considerations,particularly in view of the high cost of the suggested development at Famagusta, lose much of their importance.Against these advantages must he set, in the first place,the probable intensification of Greek nationalist feeling in cyprus.     Whatever view may be taken as to the means by which this feeling is stimulated, as to the reasons for the apparent imper-viousness of sections of the Greek population to unionist propaganda,and as to the likely effects of union with Greece on the materialwelfare of the Cypriots, there seems little reason to doubt that thedemand for union will grow rather than diminish.      It follows from this that no concession of self-governing institutions can be made withoutthe risk of immediate deadlock, such as was only resolved in the days of the Legislative Council by balancing the official and Turkishdeputies against the Greek, by giving the Governor,a casting vote, andby frequent resort to Orders in Council,      Yet it is contrary to the traditions and in general to the interests of the British Empire tomaintain in political subjection a people whose social and culturallevel justifies the claim to self-determination.      In Cyprusparticularly, the presence of a dissatisfied and potentially hostilepopulation would be a factor of weakness which might embarrass the ruling Power in a moment of crisis, or even nullify entirely theadvantages in vie?; of which the island was held. Furthermore, constantfriction in Cyprus between the British authorities and the Greekpopulation would have an unfortunate effect on Greco-British relations.Finally, the development of a naval base at Famagusta might be resented or viewed with suspicion by the Government of Turkey.7.      The second alternative, that of retaining sovereignty whilegranting certain rights and facilities to one or more interestedPowers, might involve one or both of the following arrangements:(a) the leasing of a base, at Farnagusta or elsewhere, to turkey.      This would remove any objection which the TurkishGovernment might otherwise have to the continued occupationof Cyprus by Great Britain.      But at the same time, by introducing a further obstacle to union with Greece, itwould add to the dissatisfaction of the Greek Governmentand people, unless it were accompanied by(b) the concession to the Greek Government of some form ofprotectorate over the Greek-speaking Cypriots.If the rights of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Cyprus were limited by arrangements of this kind, the arguments for retaining the island would be seriously weakened, while the major argument against its retention - the almost certain persistence of the desire of the Cypriot Greek nationalists to substitute Greek for british rule - would not be met by a concession of rights to the GreekGovernment.     Such concessions would stimulate rather than appeasethe desire for union.8.      If the Anglo-French Convention of the 23rd December 1920were to retain its validity after the present war, either of thetwo alternatives already examined could be adopted without thenecessity of obtaining French consent.   This consent, however, wouldbe necessary before negotiations could be opened for giving effectto either of the remaining suggestions.9.      The first of these is that sovereignty over Cyprus should&quot;be transferred to Greece in return for the cession or leasing of sites for naval and air bases.    The leasing of bases to outside Powers in territories the sovereignty over which is retained by the leasingPower is a device which is likely, after the precedent.set by theAnglo-American Agreement of the 27th March 1941, to be suggested forthe solution of many conflicts between the strategic interests of aGreat/

Great Power and the desires of a local population.      the strict application of the Anglo-American analogy,   ingeographical terms, to Cyprus would dictate the retention of sovereignty by the distant ruling Power,  Great Britain,  andthe leasing of a base to the neighbouring Power, Turkey.But the situation in Cyprus differs in two important respects from that in the British West Indian islands:(a) even if it could be assumed that the friendly relations of H. M. Go  with the Government, of Turkey wouldbe as durable as those with the Government of the U.S.A-are likely to be,  the security of a Turkish baseagainst seizure by a third Power would not be comparable with that of an American base;(b) the populations of the British territories affectedby the Agreement of the 27th March, unlike the majority in Cyprus,,  desire to remain under the British flag.It would seem more natural,  therefore,  if the device ofseparating sovereignty from military facilities is to beapplied to Cyi??.:: .;r   for HYM,,G*  to cede the island to Greecein return for such facilities,   either for a term of years orin perpetuityc      A solution along these lines was suggestedby Mc Venizelosj   speaking in the Greek   Chamber,  as long arcas November 1931;    and there seems to be reason to suppose that^the Cypriot Greeks would prefer this solution. - asaffording them greater security - even to an unconditionalassumption of sovereignty by Greece.If,  as seems probable,  this solution had as one of itsconsequences the establishment of friendly relationsbetween the British personnel and the local population,British interests in Cyprus would be more secure than theyare at present.      Even in the event of Greco-Britishhostilities at some future date,   it is doubtful whether thenecessity of defending a land frontier in Cyprus would be agreater liability than a rebellious subject population.10.    It is necessary at this point to notice the closerelationship which exists between the problem of Cyprus andthe problem of th,, Dodecanese.      If it is proposed,  at the cessation of hostilities,  to transfer the islands of the dodecanese,  wholly or in part,   to Greece,  two questionsbearing on the future of Cyprus will arise:(a) Is it possible to recognise the claim of Greece tothe Dodecanese without recognising that her claim to cyprus is of the same character and of almost equalfore e?(b) Is it, at the same time, desirable to obtain forGreat Britain, in return for the cession of Cyprus, abase in the Dodecanese?11 o    If it were decided in principle to cede Cyprus to greece while asking for naval and air bases elsewhere onGreek territory,  the suggestions which H.M.G. might make asto the location&quot;of these bases would depend upon^considerations which lie outside the  scope of thismemorandum.      It might be thought   desirable on strategicgrounds to securefaciliti.es in Suda Bay,  in which case theproposal  to transfer Cyprus would provide an opportunity toraise this question.      If.,  on the other hand, a smallerisland were thought to of-\sr greater security than eitherCrete or Cyprus,  the latter might be exchanged for one of the islands of the Dodecanese,      The second course would-have thefurther advantage that the Greek Government would probablybe/

be more ready to renounce an island which is not at presentin their possession than to relinquish control of Suda Bay.-The same strategic considerations might, however, leadto the conclusion that,   if bases are retained in theneighbourhood of Suez,  any further territorial outpost inthe Eastern Mediterranean would be a liability rather than an asset.      If this conclusion were reached,  Cyprus could be handed over to Greece without any territorial compensation.It nood n0&quot;t follow,  however,  that the cession should be wholly unconditional;    the island might be demilitarised,  orGreece might bind herself,  on the lines of the existing british undertaking to Prance, not to alienate it to a thirdPower without British consent.      Guarantees of this kindcannot take the place of effective occupation but,  on the assumptions made in this paragraph,  the policy of abandoningCyprus would not be determined to any large extent bybelief in their adequacy.      That being so,  it might be thoughtpreferable on political grounds to make the more confidentgesture of relinquishing Cyprus without any conditions whatever.12.    Any proposal to place Cyprus under Greek rule wouldhave to take into account the interests of the Turkish-speaking minority and the strategic anxieties of the TurkishGovernment.      The responsibility for inserting adequate safeguards for the former into the Anglo-Greek agreement forthe transfer of sovereignty would rest upon H.M.G.      Thelatter issue might be a matter for direct negotiation betweenthe Greek and Turkish Governments, unless,  as has beensuggested above,   the future of Cyprus were considered inrelation to the future of the Dodecanese.      If the problem ofethnically Greek islands lying near the Turkish coast and nowin the possession of other Powers could be dealt w^th as awhole,  the result would presumably be a tripartite agreement which provided substantial satisfaction for the claims of greek nationalism while meeting the strategic requirements ofTurkey and,  if any were advanced,  of Great Britain.       As a last resort,  it might be necessary to examine the possibilityof a Greco-Turkish ex hange of populations,  carried out insuch a way as to remove both the Turkish minority from cyprus and the Greek- population from one or more of the islands ofthe Dodecanese;&apos;   the defect of such solutions - the hardshipthey impose on individuals - might in this instance,  in viewof the relatively small numbers affected, be more than offset by the removal of what might otherwise be causes of friction between Greece and Turkey.
