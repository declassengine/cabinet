APPLICATION OF CONSCRIPTION TO NORTHERN IRELAND.

Memorandum by the Home Secretary.

1. The following paragraph appeared in "The Times" this morning (23rd May):-

From our Correspondent

BELFAST, May 22

Mr. J. Beattie, M.P., Leader of the Labour group in the Northern Ireland Parliament, in a statement on conscription said today:-

Labour in Northern Ireland is dead against it because it is well aware of the realities of the situation in Ireland and it knows the far-reaching reaction which such a step would bring about. I wish to state solemnly that if Mr. Churchill forces conscription on Northern Ireland his action will prove one of the biggest blunders in the history of Ireland or England. It can only lead to strife and tragedy, and I warn Mr. Churchill not to be led into this trap by an unrepresentative junta like the Ulster Unionist Council. If democracy means anything the Ulster Government should test the feeling of the people on the matter by appealing to the electorate in a General Election. Everyone here knows what the answer would be.

I understand the Labour Group in the Northern Ireland Parliament consists of two members, Mr. Beattie and Mr. Agnew.

2. I asked my Parliamentary Private Secretary, Mr. John Jagger, M.P., to ascertain the views of Mr. Midgley, the leader of the Ulster Labour Party. Mr. Midgley is an Area Organiser of the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers, of which Mr. Jagger is the President. Appended is a note supplied to me by Mr. Jagger of his conversation, which was, of course, confidential. (Appendix I).

3. Mr. Dulanty came to see me this (Friday) morning to express an earnest hope that conscription would not be
applied&quot; to Northern Ireland,.. He. said that Mr. De Valeratook a very grave view of the proposal and thought thatthe consequences would be most serious.    Mr. Bulanty saidthat there.would undoubtedly be resistance by largenumbers of Nationalists in Northern Ireland, thatthe imprisonment of recalcitrants would no doubt befollowed by hunger striking, and that much bitterfeeling would necessarily be generated.    He referredto the history of 1916 and said that it was theprospect of conscription which contributed largely to the defeat of the Redmond policy and the rise of the extremists.Mr. Dulanty said that opposition to conscriptionwould be supported by the B ishops and he told me of anannouncement made by the Cardinal Archbishop of Armagh.A copy of this announcement is appended.   Mr. Dulantysaid that it has&apos; appeared in today&apos;s Irish newspapers.(Appendix II).Mr- Dulanty urged that any advantage which-theUnited Kingdom Government might gain by additions tothe Armed Forces would be- incommensurate with thedifficulties which conscription would cause.4.      The Military Service Act of 1916 which introducedconscription did not apply to Ireland, but there had beenprevious discussions about the application of the Actto Ireland and according to the report of the RoyalCommission which was appointed to investigate thecircumstances,of the Easter rebellion of 1916 &quot;thequestion of the application of compulsory.service gave a great stimulus to the Irish Volunteer Movement,r(a rebel movement) &quot;in the Autumn of 1915&quot;tThe^Military Service Act of 1918 contained aprovision&apos;enabling it to be extended by Order in Councilto Ireland.There was much opposition in which the Nationalistsand Labour Party joined with the Sinn Feiners.    The wholeof the weight of the Roman Catholic Church was thrownagainst the Act, which was described, in a resolution of Bishops, as &quot;an oppressive and inhuman law which theIrish people have a right to resist by all the means thatare consonant with the law of God&quot;.The Bishops drew up a form of pledge to resistconscription which was administered by the Priests afterMass to all the faithful.In fact the Act of 1918 never was applied to Ireland.H.M,25rd May, 1941.
Note by Mr.Jagger of his conversation withMr. Midgley. -I have, at your request,  spoken at length toAlderman Harry Midgley,  leader of the Ulster Labour party and a former member of the Northern Ireland Parliament.His own view is strongly in favour of conscription and he believes that to be the majority view in Northern Ireland,but he. anticipates considerable opposition.Cardinal MacRory gave an interview yesterday, to the belfast Telegraph in which he declared that his views onconscription were unchanged and he still felt that toimpose conscription on so large a number of people who inthoughtj  religion and ideas were part and parcel of neutralEire, would be indefensible0On the other hand the Rev. Prof.  Corkey, M.P.-;(Presbyterian) has declared in the strongest possible terms in favour of conscription.    Taking these two together it looks as though Protestants would be &quot;pro&quot; and R.C&apos;s &quot;anti&quot;.Alderman Midgley himself does not think there would beopen disorder but he thinks there would be some runningacross the border though that would be limited by the factthat men from Northern Ireland would find it difficult toget a living in the South.    He considers that the I.R.A.would confine their opposition to organising wholesalerefusal to register.    The Nationalists in general wouldalso take this line.Senator McLaughlin has raised in a recent speech thebogey that all loyal Ulster-men of military age are alreadyenrolled as Special Constables or are in reserved occupations and that therefore all the conscripts would be&quot;pro Sire11 if not &quot;anti-British&quot;.    Alderman Midgley saysthis is &quot;all boloney&quot; and that the majority of theconscripts would be pro-British.The Independent Unionist who won Lord Craigavon&apos;s seatagainst the official nominee has also been letting himselfgo on the subject.    His view is that conscription shouldhave been adopted at the same time that it was adopted in britain;  that it is better late than never and should beadopted now,  though he considers it will be much moredifficult now than it would have been then.Alderman Midgley also tells me that the NorthernIreland Labour Party have -a meeting on Sunday when thequestion is down for discussion.    He expects there will bea very strong minority against conscription and there may even be a majority but he will phone me the result sometime on Monday morning.I put the specific question whether he would expecttrouble in the shipyards and he was very definite that he did not as he considered the recent bombings had brought the workmen much closer together.

Mr.  Dulanty informed the Home Secretary that thefollowing statement was issLied on the 22nd May &quot;by CardinalMacRory from Archbishop&apos; s House, Armagh:-&quot;In view of the renewed threat of conscription of the six Counties I have been pressed from various quarterssince my return home last night to say something on thesubject.    Ordinarily in such a crisis I would call a meetingof the Bishops before saying anything but the matter issaid to be urgent and some of the Bishops are absent from home administering confirmation, and so there is no time toarrange for such a meeting even if it were necessary.Fortunately, however,  it is not necessary, for all the bishops concerned, with one exception, expressed their viewson the subject only two years ago.    The exception is the bishop of Derry,  the Most Reverend Dr. Farren, who was.appointed Bishop later, but I have his authority for sayingthat he warmly approves the statement then issued.    Thestatement was as follows :- .&quot;In view of the anxiety that exists at present among our people on account of the rumours of conscription wedeem it a solemn duty to make known our consideredjudgment on the situation that confronts us in the six counties.We are convinced that any attempt to imposeconscription here would be disastrous.    Our people havebeen already subjected to the gravest injustice of beingcut off from one of the oldest nations in Europe and in being deprived of their fundamental rights as citizensin their own land.In such circumstances to compel them to fight fortheir oppressor would be likely to arouse them toindignation and resistance.    It would be regarded byIrishmen, not only in the Six Counties, but in Eire and throughout the world wherever they are found,  as anoutrage on the national feeling and an aggression upon our national rights.If those who think they have benefited by Partitiondesire to shew their gratitude it should not benecessary to impose upon them compulsory military service.In actual fact the British Government stands to loserather than gain by such an attempt.&quot;Continuing, His Emminence said to-day:-&quot;Nothing that has happened since these words were writtenlessens their force in the slightest degree.    That the peopleof all creeds and classes in Belfast have recently suffered heavily at the hands of the Germans, however regrettable itmay be,  does not touch the essence of the question which isthat an ancient land, made one by God, was partitioned by aforeign power against the vehement protests of its people andthat conscription would now seek to compel those who stillwrithe under this grievous wrong to fight on the side of itsperpetrators.
