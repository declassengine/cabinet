It is thought that parts of these areas are likely to be oil bearing and that it might be possible to develop them inthe same way as those of Lake Maracaibo (whence most of the Venezuelan oil is derived). Several important British oil companies have displayed an interest inprospecting for oil beneath the sea bed in this area,2. The course of the protracted negotiations on this subject have beenimpeded by (i) the Venezuelan claims to sovereignty over the islet of Patos, a tinydependency of Trinidad situated in the Northern entrance to the Gulfwithin 3 miles of the Venezuelan coast;(ii) our claim, which the Venezuelans have refused expressly to recognize,to Soldado Rock, which lies 5 miles from the shore of Trinidad inthe Southern mouth of the Gulf;(iii) the urgent necessity of providing for the defence of the Gulf againstthe possibility of submarine attack;(iv) a suggestion by certain subordinate United States military authoritiesK that guns should be mounted on Patos as part of the defences of theUnited States naval and air base on the island of Trinidad.11344   [22421]considered by the Cabinet/A. E.M.A. V. A.LA.
3. The present position is that agreement in principle with the VenezuelanGovernment has been reached on a line, ABXY on the map, of division of thesea bed which is entirely satisfactory to us (on account of the share it gives us ofthe potential oil-bearing areas) on condition (a) of cession by us of Patos to Venezuela;(b) of a statement by Venezuela that she has not claimed and will not layany claim to Soldado;(c) of the acquiescence by Venezuela in certain measures involving violations of her neutrality already taken unilaterally by us for the defence ofthe Gulf against submarine attack.4. No date has yet been fixed for the cession of Patos, which the VenezuelanGovernment are naturally anxious should take place as soon as possible. Thispoint is discussed below (see paragraph 7).5. As regards the United States interest in Patos (see paragraph 2 (iv)),Lord Halifax has been asked to explain to the United States authorities con-cerned (in writing) that the moral commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government toVenezuela in regard to the islet do not allow us to agree to its use in connexionwith the defence of the United States base at Trinidad. In drafting the lease for the United States base at Trinidad care was taken so to word the relevantpassage as to avoid committing His Majesty&apos;s Government to the inclusion ofPatos, and the United States delegates were made aware of the position. TheUnited States Government have, in any case, been kept informed by theVenezuelan Government throughout of the progress of our negotiations withthem.6. An announcement by the Venezuelan Government and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that agreement has been reached will also effectively prevent thesuccess of any attempts on the part of the United States oil interests to upset theagreement regarding the Gulf or of the United States Military authorities to insist on the provision of facilities on Patos the grant of which would put an end to the hope of any agreement with Venezuela.7. It is in our interest, for the reasons given above, to agree to an earlycession. The view was formerly held that, unless the interests of the defence ofthe northern entrance to the Gulf could be safeguarded, cession before the endof the war could not be considered. This situation has been completely altered by the establishment of our anti-submarine defences and their extension (essentialto their efficacy) into Venezuelan territorial waters, which the VenezuelanGovernment have so readily accepted. This satisfactory attitude on their partwill only be maintained if agreement is reached regarding an early cession ofPatos. The defence interests of Trinidad are thus best served not by theretention, but by the cession, of the island.8.   Approval is accordingly sought for the following : :(1) that the cession of Patos to Venezuela be approved in principle, asserving the economic interests of Trinidad;(2) that, in view of the defence advantages of early cession, the necessaryformalities should be completed forthwith;(3) that steps should be taken for the very early issue, at latest in time forthe Venezuelan Presidential Election, of a joint statement by HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Venezuelan Government regardingboth the submarine areas of the Gulf and Patos, pending the signature of simultaneous formal agreements on both matters. The draft ofsuch a statement, for discussion with the Venezuelan authorities, is annexed.9. Drafts of treaties which will require ratification regarding respectivelythe submarine areas of the Gulf and Patos have been approved by the LawOfficers. The Law Officers were also consulted on the procedure for the cession of Patos; they state that, although it is technically not strictly necessary to seekParliamentary approval for a cession of territory in the circumstances, it isdesirable that ratification of the Treaty of Cession should not take place until ithad been submitted to Parliament for approval. It is therefore proposed tointroduce a short Bill for this purpose.  If this action is approved, it is proposed
that the two treaties relating respectively to the sea-bed of the Gulf and to Patosshould be signed as soon as possible, but that ratification should await theapproval of Parliament to the Treaty of Cession.Foreign Office, April 12, 1941.Draft Press Communique regarding the Conclusion of the Paria-PatosNegotiations.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the VenezuelanGovernment will shortly sign an Agreement defining their respective interests asregards the submarine areas of the Gulf of Paria, which separates the Island ofTrinidad from the Venezuelan mainland. A second Agreement will provide forthe cession to Venezuela of Patos, a small island within 3 miles of the Venezuelancoast.
