M.The War Office,$th June, 1941.From C-in-C, Middle East.   D. 2013/3/6.   To The War Office.   R. 0745/4/6.Army HQ., Melbourne (for General Sturdee).G.O.C., N.Z. Military forces, Wellington, N.Z. (for General Duigan).C.-in-C. India (for General Auckinleck).C.G.S., Pretoria (for Field Marshal Smuts).Immediate.To C.I.G.S. from General Wavell. I have now seen Freyberg and severalBrigadiers from Crete and think you might like to have brief outline andgeneral summary of the operations.1. Our troops were disposed in three groups. The main group held fromMaleme Aerodrome, about ten miles west of Canea, to Suda Bay. The secondwas at Retimo and the third at Heraklion. The general composition of these groups was given in my 0/67416 of 25 May.2. At approximately 0800 hours on 20 May the enemy launched his attack.First and main objective was Maleme aerodrome, which was subjected toextremely heavy bombing and machine gunning attack. Majority of A.A.Arty, was put out of action practically at once. This was followed bydropping of parachutists and arrival of gliders in area between Maleme andCanea. Except for those who landed outside defended area principallyat Prison, practically the whole of these were accounted for, the greater proportion being killed. Estimated number dropped on first day was about 3500.Parachutists were dropped from heights varying from 300 to 600 feet. Theywere extremely well equipped but prisoners taken did not appear to bepicked troops. They had obviously expected easy victory and were completelysurprised by resistance encountered. Captured documents showed enemy&apos;sobjective in Canea area for first day, none being achieved. It appeared that afterinitial failure at Canea and Mai erne enemy sought success at two other aero-dromes. Retimo and Heraklion were both heavily attacked by bombers later in the day and there were parachute landings. At Retimo about 1000parachutists landed, and all but about 200 were accounted for during thefirst three days. Much the same occurred at Heraklion where about 2000were dropped.   800 were buried by our troops, not including over 300 killed
by Greeks, and undoubtedly many others were killed. At end of first day enemy had failed to gain control any aerodrome. Bomber and fighterattacks were repeated on the second day and further area occupied by our troops. Our troops had withdrawn from outskirts of Maleme aerodromewhich, however, remained under fire. Despite close range arty, andmortar fire troop carriers began to land in evening on aerodrome, on beaches andon area west of aerodrome which was then out of range of guns. Enemy losses in personnel and machines was heavy. Observers estimate that there were atleast 100 wrecked planes in the Maleme area. Arrival of these reinforcements made it necessary to reinforce Maleme defences, and plans for attack in Canea area had to be altered. In the night, the Royal Navy were seen to deal satisfactorilywith an enemy attempt at seaborne reinforcement. On the third day troopcarriers continued to arrive and depart again at rate of more than 20 per hour,and observers estimated 600 arrived. Maleme became operational aerodrome.Plan to counter attack had to be dropped owing to enemy attack threatening to cut off troops in western sector. Withdrawal to new line commenced. Mean-while, enemy had not attempted further attacks at Retimo and Heraklionbut had landed forces outside range of our troops and taken up positions withobject of containing them and pinning them to ground until battle in Canea area was finished.5. On fourth day new line was formed in Maleme-Canea sector. On sixth daylate at night this postition was broken after several attacks had been repulsed andwith the enemy through to Suda Bay the decision to evacuate Crete was taken.Retimo and Heraklion were secure but at Retimo there was an acute shortage offood and ammunition and communications were severed.6. During whole of operations our positions were subjected to bombing and machine gunning from enemy planes which is described by experienced officers who fought in last war as far exceeding in severity any artillery barrage theyhad ever encountered. Very heavy bombs up to 500 and 1,000 lbs. were used.Enemy method was to reconnoitre carefully at low height until exact positionour troops had been ascertained and then put down relentless barrage. directions to enemy planes in air were also given by wireless.7. Enemy infantry did not show high fighting qualities and did not face1    counter attack.   Our counter attacks were always successful but once enemy had\   ascertained new positions dive bombing attacks began and infantry were blastedV out.   All counter attacks had to be by night.   By these methods and by graduallyincreasing weight of numbers (estimated that enemy landed approximately one division in Maleme area) our troops after six days fighting were driven from their positions and compelled to withdraw.   Severity of fighting in this area, number of casulties, and weight of enemy bombardment are described as far exceeding any-thing seen in similar space in last war.8. As you know we were unable to reinforce except in small numbers bywarship since enemy dive bombers made it practically impossible for any ship toremain afloat near the island during hours of daylight and only fast ships whichcould get in and out during the night stood any chance of survival. When it became obvious that the island could no longer be held orders were given for withdrawal and arrangements made to try and evacuate the force. Details of evacuation will be given in subsequent cable.9. Failure to defend island was due to enemy&apos;s complete superiority in air and his persistence in continuing landing in spite of losses. Extremely heavyscale of air attack could only have been countered by fighter aircraft whichcould not operate over Crete from the only air bases available those in N. Africa.10. Enemy was no match for our troops in dose fighting.   He was veryA    quick to follow up a success but otherwise showed no particular tactical skill.i \    His observance of Red Cross seems to have been uncertain, generally speaking he\   respected it but there were undoubtedly instances of attacks on hospitals.  On one\   occasion captured R.A.F. personnel were driven in front of attacking lines.1 \ There appears to be no truth in the report that enemy parachutists landed in* \ N.Z. uniform.    This report   apparently originating from  an  incident whereparachutists drove some N.Z. walking wounded in front of their advance.xb41/66)   too   6/41   W.o.P.   7861
