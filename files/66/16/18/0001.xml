NAVAL SITUATION.1. A large proportion of the British and Imperial troops have beerfevacuated from Greece. Units of the Greek fleet have arrived at Alexandria;Enemy aircraft have shown increased activity in the Eastern Mediterranean.There has been an increase in shipping losses during the week, partly due toour losses in Greek waters.Home Waters.2. Patrols have been maintained throughout the week by an 8-inch cruiserin the Denmark Strait and by two cruisers in the Iceland-Faroes Channel. Heavyunits of the Fleet have continued to act as cover to convoys in the North-western approaches.During the night of the 28th/29th E-boats attacked a convoy off Cromerand sank one ship. Two, possibly four, E-boats were damaged after beingengaged by the destroyer escort, motor launches and motor gun-boats.On the 28th the Royal Netherlands naval minesweeper Caroline was mined and sunk with all hands off Milford Haven. In air attacks during the weekH.M. Anti-Aircraft ship Patia was sunk off the Tyne, and H.M. Sloop Ernewas damaged off Kinnaird Head. Single enemy aircraft were shot down hvH.M. Minesweeper Elgin off Harwich, by British s.s. Belgravian (3,136 tons) offRattray Head and by British s.s. Dandara (213 tons) to the westward of the faroes.In an air raid on Portsmouth during the night of the 27th/28th damage was caused to the R.M. and the R.N. Barracks, H.M.S. Dolphin (depot forsubmarines) and the R.N. Hospital, Haslar. At Plymouth on the night of the28th/29th H.M.S. Raleigh (Manning depot) was damaged, 42 being killed and13 wounded. Considerable damage was also caused to buildings inH.M. Dockyard and at Bull Point. In the attack on the night of the 29th/30thH.M. Cruiser Trinidad (6-inch cruisers completing) received a direct hit but wasnot seriously damaged, two Auxiliary Patrol vessels were sunk and the floating dock was damaged.Atlantic.3. On the 28th H.M.S. Diomede intercepted the Spanish s.s. Marques d?Comillas and escorted her to Bermuda.On the 1st May the Italian tanker Sangro (6,466 tons), with oil, and an italian barquentine were intercepted to the northward of the Azores by H.M.Ocean Boarding Vessels Cavina and Corinthian.During the week twelve French merchant vessels eastbound and eight west-bound have passed Gibraltar, all under escort.The Western Hemisphere Defence Plan for the United States Navy came into operation on the 25th April. Under this scheme naval forces working fromthe American sea-board north of the Equator and as far as 26c W. (about900 miles west of Ireland) will warn Western Hemisphere Powers of the presenceof all ships belonging to belligerent nations that own no territory in the western hemisphere. Such ships will be trailed by units of the United States Fleet andtheir movements broadcast in English and en clair every four hours. For thispurpose the United States Naval forces, including aircraft, will cruise along thetrade routes leading to North Europe.Mediterranean.4. In the Eastern Mediterranean all light forces have been employed in theevacuation of British and Imperial troops from Greece. Approximately 45,000troops have been embarked. The majority of troops have been landed in Crete,but one convoy consisting of s.s. Glengyle and four transports sailed forAlexandria. It was heavily attacked by E-boats on the night of the 29th/30thin the Kaso Strait, but the attack was driven off without loss.   As no fighter
protection was available, the evacuation was carried out under constant bombing attack, and the following ships are reported lost or damaged :  s.s. Glengyle and H.M. Destroyer Nubian damaged by near-misses.s.s. Ulster Prince (3,791 tons), after grounding in Nauplia Harbour, was,1     abandoned and subsequently bombed and burnt out.s.s. Pennland (Dutch, 16,381 tons) bombed and sunk before embarkationwithout serious casualties.s.s. Slamat (Dutch, 11,636 tons) bombed and set on fire. 1,000 troopsbelieved lost.s.s. Glenearn (9,784 tons) bombed before embarkation. In tow of H.M.Sloop Grimsby for Alexandria.s.s. Costa Rica (8,672 tons) bombed and sunk without serious casualties.H.M. Destroyers Diamond and Wryneck with troops on board bombed and sunk while returning to Suda Bay on the 28th. Survivors include oneofficer and 28 ratings from Wryneck and 10 ratings from Diamond.5. Units of the Greek Navy which have now arrived at Alexandria includethe cruiser Giorgios Aver off, 6 destroyers and 5 submarines. They are to actunder the orders of C-in-C, Mediterranean.At Suda Bay H.M.S. York has been further damaged by near misses from three air attacks and H.M. Submarine Rover was disabled by a near miss and isbeing towed to Alexandria.Off the Libyan coast a bombardment of Gazala was carried out by H.M.Gunboat Ladybird, and HAL Gunboat Aphis bombarded an enemy column on theSollum escarpment. The port of Tobruk has been kept open in spite of heavyair raids, and gunboats have supported the army along the coast. submarine patrols have been maintained off Benghazi and on the line Tripoli-Pantellaria.On the 23rd five destroyers from Malta, after failing to intercept a south-bound convoy, which had been reported off Kerkenah (Eastern Tunisia), sank asouthbound merchant vessel of 3,000 tons.6. Two air raids were carried out on Malta during the 25th, when VallettaHarbour and approaches were bombed and mined. One aircraft was shot downand another damaged. During a further raid on the night of the 29th/30th,severe damage was caused to H.M. Destroyer Encounter and H.M. MinesweeperFermoy, and also to yard craft and stores in the dockyard. H.M. MinesweeperA bingdon was damaged by an acoustic mine.EM. Cruiser Dido and H.M. Minelayer A bcliel have arrived at Alexandriafrom Home Waters via the Mediterranean. The Fifth Destroyer Flotilla,previously based at Plymouth, has arrived at Malta.23 Hurricanes and 3 Fulmars were flown off from H.M.S. Ark Royal to malta on the 27th.East Africa and Red Sea.7. HM.I.S. Parvati (A/S Vessel) has been sunk by mine in the SouthernRed Sea with the loss of 1 officer and 12 ratings.On the 28th an incomplete warship raider distress signal was received froma merchant vessel, possibly the British s.s. Clan Buchanan (7,266 tons), 800 miles .E. of Seychelles.   H.M. Ships in the vicinity have been ordered to investigate.Anti-Submarine Operations.8. A belated report has been received of a promising attack on a U-boatcarried out on the 21st in the North-West Approaches by H.M. Sloop Sandicichand A/S Trawler St. Wistan. On the 28th a successful attack was made byH.M. Destroyers Ingle field and Maori to the southward of Iceland as a resultof which the U-boat is considered to have been sunk. Another promising attack in the North-West Approaches was made by H.M. Corvette Gladiolus in whichthe U-boat was possibly badly damaged or destroyed. Two other attacks, one ofwhich was by aircraft, were carried out in the North-West Approaches withoutvisible result. In an attack to the north-westward of Freetown, british.s. Carperby (4,890 tons) claims to have hit a U-boat by gunfire.[22468] b
Enemy Intelligence.German.9. Air reconnaissance at Kiel on the 25th April and again on the 30th April,confirmed the presence of the two 8-inch cruisers, one of these in the south floating dock, and of the pocket battleship Admiral Scheer in the dry dock. The Schlesien vClass battleship was also present on the 30th. No other Main Units were seen in German ports. At Brest, the continued presence of the two battle cruisers hasbeen confirmed up to the 29th April. There is reason to believe that Gneisenauhas been damaged by air attack on three occasions on the night of the 4th/5thApril, on the night of the 6th /7th April and again on the 10th April.Air reconnaissance on the 27th April saw no sign of the naval force whichhad been reported at Narvik on the 22nd, and this force has not since been located.Italian.10. In the absence of air reconnaissance of Italian ports there has been ooevidence of the positions of Italian Main Units in the&quot; period, under review.There has, however, been considerable evidence of escorted convoys off theTunisian coast and of the use of Benghazi.One of the destroyers sunk in the action on the 16th April has now been identified as being of the Folgore Class (1,220 tons, built 1931). The destroyerseen by aircraft reconnaissance on the 24th April lying stopped off Cape Bonis now said to have been sunk by a mine.U-Boats.11. The chief feature of the enemy U-boat dispositions in the period underreview has been the arrangement of the Germans in two groups in the North-Western Approaches. One group, consisting of about five U-Boats, has been working North of 600 N, and two or three of these were concentrated for the attack on a homeward-bound convoy from Halifax. The second group, which is rather smaller, has been active to the South of 550 N. In addition to these therehave been five or six Italians in the North-Western Approaches. There have alsobeen about three Germans at work in the Cape Verde Islands area, and to thesouth of it, and one off the coast of Brazil in the region of Bahia.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.12. According to the information at present available the merchantshipping losses during the week ended noon, Wednesday, the 30th April,amounted to 15 ships (95,806 tons), of which 11 ships (82,857 tons) were British.Seven ships were sunk by U-Boat in the North-Western Approaches, four of whichwere in a homebound convoy from Halifax. Two allied hospital ships and threetransports were sunk by aircraft in the Eastern Mediterranean, and. two british ships were bombed and sunk in home waters. One ship was sunk by E-boat offthe East coast.Convoys on the East coast have been attacked by aircraft on five days duringthe week with little success, and Focke-Wulf aircraft have twice attackedshipping in the North-Western Approaches.Details are given in Appendix I of losses and damage to ships of whichaccurate information has now come to hand. These losses total 33 ships andone small craft sunk (188,660 tons), of which 12 ships (66,962 tons) form part ofthe casualties given in the paragraph above. Of the remaining losses 8 ships(46,995 tons) were sunk by U-boats, 2 ships (8,635 tons) by aircraft, one ship (8,621 tons) by mine, 9 ships (55,292 tons) by surface craft and 1 ship and.1 small craft (2,155 tons) by unknown cause. In addition details are given of 15 ships and 3 small craft damaged.Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. During the week ended noon, the 30th April, 720 ships, including136 Allied and 10 neutral, were convoyed. One battleship, 4 cruisers, 7 armed merchant cruisers, 3 submarines, 50 destroyers and 53 sloops and. corvettes were employed on escort duties. Since the beginning of the war 61,887 ships havebeen convoyed, of which 309 have been lost by enemy action.
Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the26th April totalled 796,426 tons, compared with 756,472 tons during the previousweek and an average of 700,462 tons during the past ten weeks. Oil imports, in31 tankers, were 340,093 tons, compared with 247,061 tons in 23 tankers duringthe week ending the 19th April. Mineral imports were 178,893 tons, of which&apos;124,346 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. The corresponding figures for the previous week were 131,196 tons and 86,467 tons. Timber imports were 27,186 tons and cereal imports 134,361 tons, 15 ships being fully laden withgrain. Other food imports amounted to 48,058 tons, including : fruit 7,062 tons,tinned fish 4,485 tons, sugar 6,475 tons, tea 1,913 tons, meat 11,701 tons andbutter 2,915 tons. The fruit imports included three shiploads of sweet oranges,totalling 4,807 tons, and 784 tons of fresh tomatoes. Imports of machinery(3,127 tons of machine tools), aircraft, aircraft engines and war material wereabove average.British Minelaying.14. The only sea-borne mine laying operation in the period under review wascarried out by .F.I.M. Ships Southern Prince, Port Quebec and Menestheus, whichlaid 1,220 mines to the North of Iceland on the 26th April.Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out off Brest and Cherbourg.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.15. Minelaying operations of enemy aircraft have been widespread, and include the Tyne, Liverpool Bay to Anglesey, Portsmouth, Plumber, thames estuary and Bristol Channel. All ports, however, were open on the 1st May,except Liverpool, which is closed by night only.There have been only two casualties, a minesweeper belonging to the RoyalNetherlands Navy, which was blown up by an acoustic mine while sweepingMilford Haven and a harbour launch, which was blown up in the upper part ofPortsmouth Harbour.Nine magnetic and sixty-four acoustic mines have been detonated duringthe week; thirty-two of the latter having been detonated in the Humber. the mine totals are now : Magnetic 1.088, Acoustic 578, Contact 861.Malta reported that enemy aircraft laid mines on three successive nights.Dangerous areas due to mines have been declared about 105 miles S.W. of malta and off Kerkenah Island on the Tunisian coast. Special mine-sweeping gear,which had been intended for vessels in home waters, has been shipped to Malta to deal with the situation.A belated report has been received of the sinking of a fishing trawler on the26th March by a mine about 35 miles ME. of Sydney, New South Wales. It isthought that the mine was laid last November.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.16. Our aircraft attacks on enemy shipping are enumerated under the air situation, paragraph 45.The Lech (3,290 tons), with a cargo of hides, and the Bahitonga (4,422 tons),with diesel oil, have sailed from Rio de Janeiro and Santos respectively. TheNatal (3,172 tons) has reached Santos from Hamburg.Italian.17. The tanker Gianna. M. (5,719 tons) sailed from Las Palmas on the 27thfor an unknown destination.Three 10,000-ton tankers building in Italy for the Mexican Government havebeen confiscated as a reprisal for the Italian tankers taken over by the mexican government.Correction.Resume No. 86, paragraph 4. Delete reference to H.M.S. Malaya. Thisship is refitting in the United States.
Greenland.18. By the end of 1940 the Allies had removed all German parties stationed in Greenland and none were at, work there during the winter months. In the lastdays of March, i.e., on the 27th, 28th and 31st, reports were received of german aircraft seen over Scoresby Sound. Of these, the report of a large four-enginedN&apos;aircraft, possibly a Focke-Wulf, on the 27th and a two-engined aircraft onthe 31st were considered the most important. It is thought possible that the first of these two had dropped parachute troops and that the second was on recon-naissance to observe how these troops were faring. It was in consequence of thisenemy activity that the United States made an agreement with the DanishAmbassador in Washington in the matter of Greenland, an agreement which was subsequently repudiated by the Danish Government under duress. The UnitedStates have since established a patrol of coastguard cutters off south-easternGreenland and are seeking sites for aerodromes at either Sandestron Fjord onthe West coast, or Julianehaab on the East coast. The State Department has agreed to the establishment by the Canadians of a D/ F Station at Julianehaab,where the United States will also erect a wireless station.MILITARY SITUATION.Europe.Greece.(An outline map showing the lines of the German invasion of Greece is included as an inset to this Resume.)19. After we were successfully established on the Thermopylae position, the disintegration and ultimate capitulation of the Greek Armies again opened ourleft flank by way of the road down the West coast of Greece and along the North coast of the Gulf of Corinth. It was necessary, therefore, to put into operation the plans for the immediate evacuation of our forces and the withdrawal fromthe Thermopylae position began on the 23rd April. Details of the evacuation and definite figures are not yet available. It is estimated from information so farreceived that between 24th and 30th April a large proportion of our force was successfully evacuated.   Some 30,000 of these troops have now arrived in Crete.Spain.20. Reconnaissance of the Franco-Spanish frontier shows nunierjpus jhompsof inatexial, and reports suggest that troop movements in that direction are intended or are possibly already in progress.Reports have been received of military preparations in Southern Spain andof the presence there of German officers, and in Madrid the members of theGerman Fifth Column are reported to have had a mobilization rehearsal on the20th April, Hitler&apos;s birthday.Portugal.21. Although the possibility of a German drive towards Gibraltar and the battle in the Western Desert are at present to the fore, a surprise attack onPortugal is a contingency to be reckoned with.22. It is reported that two German residents in Portugal were invited bythe German Legation to complain of ill-treatment at the hands of the Portuguese,and German propaganda still stresses British designs on Portugal and thenecessity of affording her German &quot; protection.&quot;U.S.S.R.23. There are no reliable indications of imminent hostilities between germany and the U.S.S.R., but there seems little doubt that the relations betweenthe two countries remain somewhat strained. The return to Moscow this week of the German Ambassador and delegation may reveal the position a little more clearly.
24. Several reports have been received of the arrival of German troops inAboJsouth-westFinla^ m the last few days. These troops -(controls  report paiu thejwrmbdi- at 12.000. buf 1,111.^ re aflmpafr-cegfcftialfr in crrargor^tinn) ai&apos;e said to have proceeded northwards, but there is no indication of the purpose for which they/are intended. Ihe same may be said of the German forces in Moldavia whichaccording to several reports, have been considerably reinforced recently&apos; Theymay be reliefs or Germany may be continuing her War of nerves. In any case itis unlikely that she will take any open action against Russia until theMediterranean situation has been clarified.Africa.Libya and Egypt.25. On the evening of the 21st April there was a heavy combined Germanand Italian air attack on Tobruk harbour, resulting in the sinking of two merchant ships and damage to a third. Direct hits were also scored on the mainquay, but our casualties were light and four enemy aircraft were destroyed.In the Sollum area our troops, supported by Naval shelling, have beenharassing the enemy M.T. concentrations, which were dispersed with numerouscasualties.   Enemy air activity against our forward troops is increasing.Our covering force has withdrawn to the general line Buq Buq/Bir Sofafiand our patrols are in observation east of Sollum. Two small enemy columnsare reported south of Halfaya. A small enemy patrol reconnoitred the coast road to a point 8 miles west of Buq Buq and then withdrew.26. There are indications that the German scale of effort may shortly beincreased. In addition to the 5th Light Armoured (Colonial) Division already in Cyrenaica, elements of the 15th Armoured Division have arrived and strenuous efforts are being made to bring up the remainder to the forward area. Thereare no indications to show when this move will have been completed, but thefirst week in May is regarded as a possibility. Reconnaissance shows thatreinforcements of men and material are also being transported to Cyrenaicaby air.In short there is every indication that at the moment the Germans areregarding Libya as the theatre of war to which their maximum efforts shouldbe devoted.27. The actual extent of Italian participation in the Axis advance eastwardis somewhat uncertain. It is thought probable that one armoured divisiondisposing about 140 tanks of various types and one infantry division are operating in the Tobruk area under German control, and that a small numberof infantry are employed in the Bardia-Sollum area.Morocco.28. German infiltration into French Morocco continues, and the germans are showing interest in the communications of the country. The infiltrationappears to be taking place in part through Spanish Morocco and Tangier. Thesetactics may be connected with, and in preparation for, German designs on theSpanish mainland. They are also no doubt intended eventually to weaken Frenchinfluence in Africa and to deprive Marshal Petain of what constitutes a most valuable bargaining counter.A abyssinia,29. Dessye has been occupied by our force advancing from Addis Ababa.Prisoners captured during and following the occupation so far number 5,500Italians, together with a number of senior officers and 2,400 Colonial troops. Wehave also taken 93 guns. Our aircraft successfully carried out attacks on enemyM.T. which were in retreat and other of our forces encountered the enemy with-drawing northwards.In the Metemma area the enemy are now retiring towards Ohelga.Syria.30.   There are reliable indications of the possible imminence of a german air-borne attack on Syria.   General Dentz, the French (Vichy) High Commis-[22468] c
sioner, and the units of the French Army in Syria, however much they may feelsympathy with Great Britain, have given little grounds for hope that they would co-operate with any British intervention, or even oppose the arrival of german troops, if ordered by Vichy not to do so.Iraq.31. It is clear now that Rashid Ali, when he agreed to the landing of thefirst British troops at Basra, was taken by surprise and even to some extentbluffed. He is now attempting to recover the ground he then lost. His first movewas to express to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador the hope that his Government wouldbe given due notice before the arrival of any more troops and that, before suchreinforcements arrived, those already disembarked should be passed through thecountry to Palestine without delay; to this intimation His Majesty&apos;s Governmentreturned no reply. The Iraqi Army has now been concentrated in and to thesouth of Baghdad, and there is evidence that Raschid Ali, if he is confident of receiving Axis air support, may offer resistance to our troops.32. Further troops were landed on the 29th April at Basra and, contraryto expectations, the landing was unopposed. The British airborne troops reportedto have landed at Shaibah last week have been moved to the R.A.F. station atHabbaniyah.AIR SITUATION.General Review.33. The main weight of our attack was directed against coastal and shipping targets in occupied territory. Mannheim and Berlin were also bombed.Our day bombers have met with considerable success against enemy shipping.The enemy&apos;s main attacks this week have been directed against Plymouthand Portsmouth.   Two heavy attacks have been made on Malta.Germany and Occupied Territory.34. During the week Bomber Command flew 202 day and 478 night sorties.Day operations have continued at about the same intensity as last week, but nightsorties show a substantial increase. Coastal Command have supported these operations by night attacks on Channel and Dutch ports.Day.35. The majority of daylight attacks have again been directed against enemy coastal shipping, details of which will be found under Coastal Operations.On the 24th, two Blenheims, unable to locate any shipping, attacked the wireless station at Utsire, demolishing a building and scoring hits near the mast, and onthe following day equally successful attacks were made on two wireless stations and on railways in Western Denmark. On the 26th, the aerodrome at Bergenwas bombed and a Messerschmitt 110 destroyed while taking off. Targetsattacked in Holland include steel works and docks at Ijmuiden and docks atDen Helder. Hampdens also took part in these operations, and scored severalhits on buildings in a factory at Meppel, and on a marshalling yard in the sametown, the latter with a 1,900 lb. bomb. Another bomb of similar size was dropped on De Kooy aerodrome. A large five-storeyed building on the German island ofBaitrum, believed to be a factory, and a factory and a camp near Cologne were also bombed. On the 28th, a Stirling dropped eighteen 500 lb. bombs from ,000 feet across the shipyards at Emden, but re-entered the clouds before thebursts could be observed.36. Fighter patrols were despatched each day against ground targets inFrance and the Low Countries. Aerodromes, barges, goods trains and gun positions were attacked, but no notable results were observed.Night.37. Kiel, Mannheim and Hamburg have been the principal targets of theweek. Kiel was heavily attacked on three nights and over 150 tons of H.E. and20,000 incendiaries were dropped. On two of these occasions the weather was good, but exact observation was difficult, due to ground haze and to intense anti-aircraft and searchlight activity, but many fires were seen to break out, some of
them in the vicinity of Krupp&apos;s works. On the third occasion the weather wascloudy, but forty-eight aircraft reached their target and bombed the industrialdistricts of the town, without being able to observe results. Fifty tons ofH.E. and about 10,000 incendiaries were dropped in the industrial areaMannheim, where the burst of a 4,000-lb. bomb was followed by a largelire and an explosion ten minutes later. Hamburg was attacked by forty-four aircraft, whose bombs included one of 4,000 lbs. and three of 1,900 lbs. Berlinwas twice attacked by Starlings, on one occasion by a single aircraft and on theother by three, but the results of the 14 tons of H.E. dropped could not be observed.38. The petroleum harbour at Rotterdam was bombed on two nights by atotal of eighteen aircraft, and during an attack on Brest by twelve aircraft23 tons of H.E. were dropped. Attacks of lesser intensity were made on docks and shipping at Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, Bremerhaven, Emden, Ijmuiden,Ostend and Havre.39. On four nights fighter patrols totalling twelve aircraft operated overaerodromes in France and one enemy fighter was shot down. Bombs were droppednear aircraft on the ground and along, flare paths, and at Rosieres fires were started, followed by explosions.United Kingdom.40. Fighter Command flew 1,213 patrols involving 3,121 sorties by day,and 2,183 night sorties were also flown. Enemy activity showed a reduction by day and by night. By day it was on a slightly reduced scale and consisted of coastal and weather reconnaissances. Fighter patrols in the Straits off theBelgian and French Coasts were maintained. A few daylight fighter sweepswere made over East Kent and on five days bombs were dropped in the Easterncoastal areas by raiding aircraft.41. After a night of scattered raids on the 26th/27th April, a smallattack developed on Portsmouth on the 27th/28th. This was followed on thetwo successive nights by moderately heavy attacks on Plymouth, and a subsidiaryattack on the Cardiff area on the night of the 29th/30th April. London was free of raids during the period.42. Conditions were less favourable for night interception than in theprevious period, but our fighters shot down five enemy bombers, probably destroyed another and damaged three more, while A.A. guns and other devicesaccounted for a further eight aircraft.Coastal Operations.43. Coastal Command flew 233 patrols and provided escort for 128 convoys,involving a total of 891 sorties. Aircraft of Fighter Command also flew 2,759sorties on shipping protection patrols. Many successful photographicreconnaissances were flown.44. On the 28th an aircraft on routine patrol reported an enemy convoy of ten Merchant ships escorted by two destroyers, south-west of Texel, and fourBlenheim bombers and three fighters were despatched to attack it. One of the destroyers appeared to be hit as smoke was seen to be pouring from its stern,but the four bombers were shot down by A.A. fire.45. Bomber Command aircraft have again been active in search of enemy shipping, and many successful attacks were made. Direct hits were made onthe following : A 2,000-ton tanker S.W. of Stavanger.A 1,600-ton ship at the Hook.A cargo ship of 3/4,000 tons in convoy off the E. Frisian Islands.A 7,000-ton ship off the E. Frisian Islands.  A large explosion followed.A 2-000-ton ship off Walcheren.A 2,000-ton ship off Ostend.A ship of 5,000 tons and one of 4,000 tons off Stavanger.Two small fishing vessels off Brest.
At least six other ships, one of which was seen with a heavy list, suffered damage from near misses.46. On the 30th three Blenheims attacked a tanker off the Hague, escorted by eight Flak ships and two E-boats. Owing to intense A.A. fire the results werenot observed and one of our aircraft was lost.47. Eighteen successful minelaying sorties were flown by Coastal command and eleven by Bomber Command.The Balkans.48. During the week our aircraft have continued to assist the withdrawalof our land forces by attacks on enemy communications and transport. Through-out the 29th April Blenheim fighters maintained patrols over convoys leavingSuda Bay for Egypt, and Hurricanes provided additional cover.49. The chief role of the German Air Force has been attacks againstharbours and shipping, mainly between Athens and Crete, and also in the waters of the Peloponnese. Heavy attacks have also been made on roads and on aerodromes. Thirteen Hurricanes were destroyed on the ground at Argos, Southof Corinth.50. A feature of the operations has been the use of Me. 109&apos;s against shipping in addition to Ju. 88&apos;s and Do. 17&apos;s. A detachment of air landingtroops took part in the operations against the Corinth Isthmus.Malta.51. The island was again subjected to raids at dusk on the 24th April whenthirfy aircraft attacked the dockyard, Luqa Aerodrome and the town of Valetta,where considerable damage to civilian property occurred.52. During the night of 28th/29th April two heavy raids lasting three hourswere carried out by about 50 aircraft. The main target was harbours and naval units. A.A. barrages turned away some of the raiders and probably destroyedone bomber.53. On the evening of the 29th eight enemy bombers escorted by ten fightersmade a high level bombing attack on the dockyard. Two of the raiders were brought down. Later the heaviest raid yet delivered against the island took place and lasted for over four hours. Seventy bombers took part and the dockyard andTakali Aerodrome were the main targets. Anti-aircraft fire again accounted foran enemy bomber. In these raids the dockyard suffered severe damage and a hospital was again hit. At the aerodromes at Luqa and Takali damage was not so serious.54. Reconnaissances were carried out by Glenn Martin aircraft over theTunisian Coast and Tripoli and by Hurricane over Sicily.Egypt and Libya.55. On the night the 24th/25th April Wellingtons from Malta attackedTripoli Harbour and scored hits on the Customs Wharf and a seaplane hangar.56. On six nights Wellingtons bombed the port of Benghazi. An oil dumpand the telephone exchange were hit and bursts were observed on quays androads. Numerous fires were started and harbour buildings set alight. Blenheimaircraft continued to bomb enemy motor transport near Capuzzo and in theBardia and Tobruk Areas, and attacked dispersed aircraft on the landing groundsat Derna on four occasions, and at Gazala. Hurricanes carried out many low-flying attacks on enemy ground forces and damaged M.T. petrol tankers nearBarce, while a Glenn Martin on reconnaissance machine-gunned 100 enemy troop-carrying aircraft whidh were embarking troops at Benina Aerodrome.Wellingtons and Blenheims bombed Derna and Benghazi and fourteen Hurri-canes machine-gunned about 300 motor vehicles moving eastward in small columnsbetween Gazala and Bardia.
57. The enemy attacked Tobruk on the 23rd, 24th, 27th and 28th Aprilwith approximately twenty bombers each day. On the 23rd eight enemy aircraft were destroyed and one probably destroyed, while three Hurricanes were shot down, two of the pilots being safe.58. On the 25th April enemy aircraft bombed Halfaya and Mersa Matruhand lost one aircraft by A.A. fire.59. The long-range and short-range bomber force in Libya is beinggradually reinforced, but difficulty is still being experienced by the German AirForce in supplying and servicing forward areas.Dodecanese.60. On the night the 23rd/24th April the harbour at Rhodes was againattacked and violent explosions took place.Italian East Africa and Abyssinia.61. Aircraft of the South African Air Force continued to support the movements of our ground forces radiating from Addis Ababa in the directions of Dessie and Jimma.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.62. Daylight raiding took place on five days in the period, but it was not atany time extensive. Some damage was done to houses and property at thefollowing places : On the 25th April at Lancing.On the 26th April at Folkestone and in Dover by shellfire.On the 28th April at Newburgh and Spittal (near Berwick), and with machine-gun fire at a number of points on the N.E. Coast of Scotland and at great Yarmouth.On the 29th April the Dover area was subjected to about six hoursintermittent shelling.The only serious casualties that occurred were at a chemical factory atSpittal.By Night.63. Bombing occurred on a scale of varying intensity on the first six nights of the week. There was no bombing on the last night. Plymouth and Devonport,after a lapse of only 4 days, were again raided on consecutive nights, making atotal of 5 raids in 9 nights.On the 24dh/25th April.64. There was an attack on the Isle of Wight. Four medium fires inNewport and one in Cowes were started. A military hospital was burnt out anda temporary military H.Q. received a direct hit. The only casualty reported wasone person killed.On the 25th/26th April.65. The enemy activity was almost all north of the Humber, and the enemy&apos;main bombing was concentrated on Tyneside. Considerable damage to house property and a number of casualties were reported. Some parachute mines were dropped in Hull, causing much damage and a number of casualties. The onlyserious railway incident was at Blyth, where a signal box was demolished andall lines and rolling-stock nearby destroyed.&apos;  [22468] d
On the 26th/27th April.66. There was considerable bombing over a wide area. The chief attack was against Merseyside, but it was not one of the heavier Mersey raids. Formby,Southport and Wheeloch, Cheshue, suffered a good deal of damage, but there werecomparatively few casualties. Walton prison was damaged by fire and aconsiderable area of timber was set on fire near the Southport Golf Course. Thisfire was subsequently bombed and ten parachute mines were also dropped.Portsmouth was also the object of an attack.On the 27th/28th April.67. Portsmouth was again raided and more effectively than on the previous night. A large number of fires was started. Besides damage to Naval establish-ment some dislocation was effected to the Railway Service. A part of the RoyalPortsmouth Hospital was destroyed and the hospital put out of commission. TheInfectious Diseases Hospital was also damaged. Fifty people were reported tohave been killed.In Gosport there were six fires, which included one at a cinema and anotherat the railway station, and six people were killed.On the 28th/29th April.68. Plymouth and Devonport were attacked. Damage in the centre of thecity does not appear to have been large; the enemy seems to have paid more atten-tion to military targets. Among neighbouring areas which suffered in this raid was Saltash, where the main street was seriously damaged by fire and forty housesburned out.The aerodromes at St. Eval, Cornwall, and at St. than, Glamorgan-shire, were also bombed and a parachute mine caused damage and casualties inHove.On the 29th/30th April.69. Plymouth and Devonport were again attacked, and, although the raid was on a larger scale than any of its predecessors, it began with inaccurate,bombing in open country North of the city, where wood-fires at Mount Edgcumbewere heavily bombed. It was comparatively late in the raid before the enemyfound his targets, and the attack did not therefore seem so heavy as some of itspredecessors. The raid lasted nearly four hoars, and, though its effects cannot yet be fully assessed, it is clear that, after all that the city and its environs havelately been through, this raid struck a heavy blow. The main weight of attack was felt at Key ham and Milehouse, between Plymouth and Devonport.70. High explosives seem to have predominated over incendiary attack, and only 20 fires were reported. Fires were started in Milehouse, at a Devonport gas-holder and once again at the Tor Point oil cisterns. In addition to areas ofmilitary importance, the city&apos;s civilian life seems again to have suffered severely,and a shopping centre at Mutley, rendered more important by the destruction doneelsewhere in earlier raids, was damaged in this one. Residential districts suffered severely, the worst damage of this kind being reported from the Beacon Park andHartley areas.The fires were all brought under control during the morning. Casualtiescannot yet be accurately estimated.71. Plymouth has rallied with vigour from all attacks. It is natural thatafter five such raids the people should be somewhat shaken, but the movement of population from the city is regarded as reasonably well in hand, and the problem is being largely solved by the provision of rail tickets for would-be evacuees, andby the evacuation of children from specified areas.72. Bombing was also widespread in Glamorgan, where at one time a heavy attack seemed likely to develop on Cardiff. Parachute mines and heavy H.E.were dropped in the city, and four small fires were started; but the attack wasnot pressed, and damage does not at present seem to have been extensive. About93 casualties, some&apos; of them fatal, have so far been reported.A number of bombs were dropped at other places in the West. Elsewhere,East Anglia was the only district affected.   In Norwich a number of fires were
started. Some houses and 3 factories were damaged and there were a fewcasualties.Damage.^Plymouth 28th/29th and 29th/.30th April.73. Damage in the Dockland area and to the naval establishments is recorded in the naval section.There was further dislocation of the railway system. All rail traffic toCornwall was stopped when the Paddington-Penzance express was hit at KeyhamStation, wrecking the engine and a coach, and damaging the main line.Buildings destroyed or badly damaged in this last raid include the Transportdepot at Milehouse, the Swilly hospital, the Eye hospital (direct hit), the JohnstoneSchool, the Swilly First Aid Party Depot and the Royal Western Yacht Club.Casualties.74. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours the30th April are 335 killed and 496 seriously injured. There were no casualties in London.The civilian casualties for Plymouth so far recorded for the night of the28th/29th and 29th/30th are 89 killed and 250 seriously injured, but these figures are known to be incomplete.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources :  Germany.Berlin. Recent raids have created a tremendous impression upon thepopulation, who are said to be bewildered at the extent of the damage.   Reportscontinue to be received of major damage to railway stations, factories, house property, &amp;c.   The German Minister of Health was wounded as a result of aj hit on his house in the Kurfurstendamm.f       The following report gives a picture of a recent raid on Emden : Emden. &quot; The raid on Emden, when the new H.E. was tried out, was the firstreally effective one.   The fault was that it was not repeated on the followingnights, as, if this had been the case, the nerves of the Emden inhabitants would-have been completely broken.   The people on the streets, the police, the clearing\ squads, in fact everyone, was completely broken down the following morning,j and with three raids in succession Emden would have been only a memory.   Ai little exaggerated, but not far from the truth.   Complete confusion obtained1 and; the usual shutting off of sectors could not be done.One was amazed at the great destruction caused by few bombs. The explosiveused must have been fantastic, for a bomb which fell near the post office turnedthe whole of that quarter, with the exception of the post office, into a heap ofruins. One wing of the post office was smashed and the chief office badly damaged.Houses which were 300 and even 500 metres from where the bomb fell had windowframes, doors and parts of their roofs blown out. Seventy houses were completely destroyed and- twenty-five of these were just heaps of bricks. Altogether, 200houses were damaged.  (Broken windows not included.)Of the five bombs estimated dropped on this night two caused fires200 to 300 metres high. Some four to six bomb explosions were heard, buton the day after the results of four could only be found, and therefore theexplosive:must have been dreadful.
