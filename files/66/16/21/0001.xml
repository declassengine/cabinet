TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY,It Is requested that special care may ho token to 140Qiisure the seopeoy of this document//( THIS IX)OUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOV^llLT-lxT,Secret. / COPY NOwTpT741)  98fith May. 1941.WAR CABINET.Nationalisation of the Fire Service.Memorandum by the Secretary of -State for Scotland,1. The proposals of the Minister of Home Security for the nationalisation of the Fire Service sre of a far reaching character, and as the Minister respecting-^intensification-ble for the administration of Scottish Fire Brigades, both regular and emergency,I submit the following considerations, some of which, are of a general nature,while others relate to points peculiar to Scotland.2. I fully concur in the Minister&apos;s summary of the fire brigade position at present.     I agree that certain weaknesses have become apparent as a resultof enemy air raids, arid that steps should be taken to raise the fire- service to ahigher standard of efficiency.      I do not however agree that nothing short of acomplete surrender by local authorities of their present powers will achieve theobject in view.     Heavy raids on successive nights were carried cut on Clydesidein March of this year, involving the moving of large reinforcements;    but apartfrom points of detail which have already received attention, that experience hasrevealed no weakness in the present arrangements for mutual aid,  and certainly do^snot justify the drastic step of abolishing local initiative and direction of firefighting. ...3. Fire brigades, whether nationalised or not, must remain primarily a localservice, charged with the day to day task of extinguishing ordinary as well as air-raid fires.     Even unaer circumstances of concentrated air attack the efficiency of fire brigade operations must depend upon local knowledge and local authority services, for example, water supply and feeding end billeting arrangements.Accordingly, while a centralised State service might be expected in theory to make for greater efficiency, this object would not necessarily be achieved unless thegood will of local atthorities is retained.     I regard the retention of the good will of local authorities as of fundamental importance.4. In my opinion it will not be possible to persuade local authorities .voluntarily to surrender their fire brigade powers to the State, unless they can be convinced that the desired objects cannot be achieved by some less drastic means,e.g, the combination of fire authorities and the unification of fire brigades on an area basis under Joint Boards, of which a number are already in successful operation,both in England and in Scotland.I have studied the proposals set out in the memorandum submitted by the Ministerof Home Security and I have formed the opinion that it would be possible, at any rate-in Scotland,  to secure the objects in view by taking power to require the fire brigadeswithin prescribed areas to form combinations which would be controlled by Boardsrepresentative of the combining local authorities, subject to general directions by  -the Secretary of State.     Power might also be taken to control the appointments of fire brigade officers, to co-ordinate conditions of service and ranks, and to imposeminimum training requirements.     It would be necessary to afford some measure of exchequer assistance in respect of expenditure which is not at present grant aided,in return for increased State control.     As regards the proposal to increase regionalreserves, I am of opinion that this could be secured by augmenting the resources ofthe larger combinations of fire authorities. Operational/
Operational control would remain in the hands of the Regional Commissioneras at present,  but his staff would require to be considerably strengthened.I see no reason why a reorganisation on these lines should take any longer time than the measure proposed by the Minister of Home Security.6. At this point, I should like to draw attention to certain features of fire brigade organisation which are peculiar to Scotland.     in contrast to the position in England and Wales, County Councils are fireauthorities in Scotland and except in the four cities (Glasgow, Edinburgh,Dundee and Aberdeen) the largest brigades are County Brigades.       Some ofthese brigades provide local fire services for other smaller fire authoritiesand since the passage of the Fire Brigades Act,  1938, there has been a growing tendency towards the creation of larger fire brigade units by the absorption of smaller brigades within the county system.       In the threecounties of Lanark, Dunbarton and Renfrew, which embrace nearly half thepopulation of Scotland and all the industrial areas in the basin of the clyde, there are at present not more than 16 brigades, of which 4 are verysmall. Thus Scotland possesses a framework on which larger groupings couldbe readily developed.7. Apart from the Clydeside area there are only three &quot;large brigades inScotland, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen, all at considerable distances fromone another. North of Dundee, and in the South of Scotland, the brigadesare generally small, widely separated from one-.another, and except in a few cases are manned by part-time personnel. Nationalisation of the brigadesin these areas would bring very little, if any,  advantage.       The special position of a number of the Highland Counties was recognised by a provision in the Fire Brigades Act which gave the Secretary of State for Scotlandpower to exempt these counties from the obligation to provide general (asapart from war-time) fire services.8. I would submit therefore that if the principle of nationalisationis accepted, the special conditions of Scotland necessitate separatetreatment in the application of that principle, and I would suggest that ,the Secretary of State for Scotland should be given a wide measure of discretion as to the steps to be taken in order to achieve the necessarydegree of unification and co-ordination of regular and auxiliary fire services, v-ithout necessarily taking over the entire administration from local authorities.T.J. .Scottish Office,Whitehall,    S.7.1.6th May. 1941
