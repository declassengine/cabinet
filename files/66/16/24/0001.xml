The extract relating to the defence of the Nether-lands East Indies and adjacent territories is attached. M. van Kleffens, whiledisclaiming all aggressive or challenging intentions, promised a resolute reaction to any threat and declared the willingness of the Dutch to fight if necessary, andto fight in alliance. He endorsed a view expressed by the British Commander-in-Chief, Far East, that the line running from Singapore to Australia via theEast Indies must be treated as one military unit, and that any attack on one pointin that line must be dealt with as an attack on the whole line and an attackconcerning all the affected parties alike.2. For months past we have been discussing here an exchange of assuranceswith the Netherlands Government regarding mutual support in the event of a japanese attack on our respective possessions in the Far East and its corollary or, in the view of the Chiefs of Staff, its prerequisite condition namely, a joint declaration by the British Empire, the United States of America and theNetherlands designed to deter Japan from further aggression.3. As long ago as the 5th February I circulated a memorandum to theCabinet (W.P. (41) 24) advocating an exchange of informal assurances with theNetherlands Government. The Chiefs of Staff, though recognising that it was almost inevitable that the British Empire would he compelled to support theDutch if they resisted Japanese aggression against the Netherlands East Indies,were nevertheless unwilling to recommend that any binding obligation should be entered into with the Netherlands Government without some prior assurance of support from the United States. The Chiefs of Staff aimed at a joint declaration by the United States and the British Empire that any attack on the netherlands east Indies or on British possessions in the Far East would involve Japan in immediate war with both the United States and the British Empire. An attempt was made to get the United States Government to agree to this, but Lord Halifaxwas obliged to report that he obtained no response and that the proposal was notpractical politics.4. At that time an Anglo-Dutch-Australian staff conference was in progressat Singapore. The talks were on a hypothetical basis without political commit-ment and the United States representatives attended in the capacity of observers.This conference brought out clearly the inter-dependence of the various British,Netherlands and United States territories in the Far East and attempted to memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.11377   [22511]
draw a &apos;&apos; chalk line &apos;&apos; which the Governments concerned could not afford to allow the Japanese to cross without taking active military counter-action. The circum-stances in which such action was considered necessary were a Japanese attackon or the entry of Japanese forces into British, Netherlands, Australian or NewZealand territory or mandated territory, Portuguese Timor, New Caledonia, the loyalty Islands or the Philippines, or the crossing of a geographical line drawn to the south and west of Indo-China so as to cover the Kra Isthmus and the coastsof Malaya and Borneo.5. Just after this conference Lord Halifax found Mr. Cordell Hullunexpectedly forthcoming as regards the possibility of a joint declaration. Itappeared that Mr. Hull was personally prepared to consider any declaration short of a direct threat.6. The moment for pursuing this was not immediately propitious. the february scare in the Far East was dying down and all attention was concen-trated on the Lease and Lend Bill. Moreover, the Foreign Office felt that it wasuseless and perhaps dangerous to seek a mere form of words without some clear understanding between the parties as to what they were prepared to do in practice;and that the United States were more likely to respond if told what we ourselveswere prepared to do. These views were put forward in a memorandum to theChiefs of Staff of the 27th March, advocating that a decision of principleregarding assistance to the Dutch should be taken in advance of any further approach to the United States.7. The matter was further discussed by the Chiefs of Staff in relation tocertain questions put by the Australian Prime Minister, but no decision had beenreached when the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact appeared toforeshadow some further Japanese southward move in the near future and to necessitate an early deterrent declaration. It was accordingly decided, withoutpressing further for a preliminary decision regarding assistance to the Dutch,to return to the charge with Mr. Cordell Hull in an endeavour to obtain the best possible declaration from the United States Government. As had been feared,however, this method of approach did not succeed. While not ruling out thepossibility of eventual parallel declarations, Mr. Hull, on behalf of the UnitedStates Government, expressed the view that the moment was not the most oppor-tune and he thought that further United States naval movements might be more effective.8. Meanwhile, it is true that the latest staff conference at Singapore, inwhich the Netherlands and the United States participated, has made considerable progress. But though the conference has reiterated both the need for unitybetween the countries concerned and the recommendation that some kind of&quot; chalk line &quot; should be laid down, there is no agreement yet between the Govern-ments as to the manner in which the plans will be set in motion or the circum-stances which would call them into being. The Chiefs of Staff have already referred to the Foreign Office and the Dominions Office the problem of evolving asatisfactory procedure for ensuring an immediate decision by all the Governmentsconcerned in the event of Japanese action which might be construed as an act ofwar. But this political question is hardly likely to receive a satisfactory solutionso long as there is hesitation on our part to enter into some kind of prior commit-ment or understanding vis-a-vis the Netherlands Government. The latter fortheir part lose no opportunity of drawing attention to the absence of such a commitment. It is clear that they are ready to ratify the conclusions of the singapore conference, but they would clearly welcome an assurance that the plansdrawn up at Singapore will, in fact, be fulfilled on our side should the Nether-lands East Indies be attacked.9. Experience in Europe may not encourage us to enter into further com-commitments elsewhere, but the Netherlands East Indies are in a special case. Weare already allied with the Netherlands Government against Germany. Thus,if the Netherlands East Indies were attacked by Germany&apos;s ally our moralobligations, as well as our vital need to secure our communications with australia and New Zealand and our obligations in this respect to the twodominions would make it impossible for us to stand by and see the netherlands east Indies overrun.   Frank recognition of these facts may save another debacle
which hesitation on our part may well bring about. One of our difficulties inEurope has been that we have been obliged to give guarantees first and to workout details later. In the Far East we are reversing the process. i.e:, we have worked out our plans, and it now needs some form of political commitment togive confidence that they will be applied when the emergency arises to the best of the respective abilities of the Governments concerned. In fact it only needsthe roof to complete the house, but until the roof is added the house cannot beregarded as water tight.10. I feel that in previous discussions on this subject too much emphasishas been laid on the extent of the obligation which any assurance imposes on us,and that insufficient weight has been given to the assistance which we may cur-selves derive. The forces of the Netherlands East Indies, and more particularly the help which they can give in the air and on the sea, are by no means negligible.Moreover, a firm determination&apos;on the part of ourselves and the Netherlands east indies to help each other is probably the best way of ensuring the effective help of the United States.11. On the strength of these arguments I was about, as a preliminary toa further approach to the United States, to urge the Chiefs of Staff to withdraw their opposition to a decision regarding assurances to the Dutch, which, whilepolitically desirable, would not in practice enlarge our existing military commit-ments.12. But a new way has now been opened up by M. van Kleffens&apos;s broadcast.He has had the courage to come out into the open and to make unilaterally a state-ment which, if reciprocated by ourselves, is likely to satisfy the netherlands government as to our intentions and is more likely than anything else to induce the United States to take corresponding action. Failure on our part to respondis likely correspondingly to discourage the will of the Dutch to resist.13. Moreover, if it is a fact that the United States Government contem-plate the removal of part of their Pacific Fleet into the Atlantic, it is all the more necessary to counteract any discouragement which this may cause to the dutch and to convince Japan of the joint interest in the South Seas of the BritishEmpire and the Netherlands and the United States.14. I would, therefore, invite my colleagues to approve a statement to bemade by myself on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government corresponding as closely as possible to that of M. van Kleffens; and I would propose that the draft of thestatement be communicated in advance to the Dominions and that the Govern-ments of Australia and New Zealand at all events should be invited to give itsome kind of public endorsement.16. I would propose in this statement to welcome the determination of theNetherlands East Indies to resist attack, to emphasise that we, like them, haveno aggressive intentions, but that we have an interest in any movement likely to prejudice the security of the line which runs from Malaya to New Zealand throughthe Netherlands East Indies, and that we agree that any attack on any part ofthat line equally concerns all affected parties and must be dealt with as an attackon the whole line.A. E.Foreign Office, May 12, 1941.Translation of an Extract from- M. van Kleffens&apos;s Broadcast.. . . . Dark clouds are looming above the Pacific Ocean and the landsadjoining it.We sense tension also round the East Indies. We want to live at peace withall, but not at any price. We are definitely not aggressive, and never shall any measure be expected from us which menaces others, but our opposition is againstunreasonable demands and, above all, against war, and if against our hopes weshould be threatened in these regions by force of arms, we shall act veryresolutely.  There can be no doubt about it, and I truly believe that the world has
also been impressed with, that fact gradually. The courageous spirit whichfinds expression in all the defence forces in this country and the fearless attitudeof the civilians, in whom the spirit of the pioneers still lives, cannot be concealedfrom the outside world, and to that end I shall continue to exert myself.Our position may not, indeed, be contemplated apart from that of other territories with which it is indissolubly linked up owing to the single fact of theIndies&apos; geographical situation. The British Commander-in-Chief in EasternAsia, whom I recently had the honour of meeting at Manila, referred the otherday in a press conversation to the undeniable fact that both in a political and ina military respect the line which runs from Singapore to Australia via the east indies must be treated as one unit.An attack from outside on any point situated along this line must thus beconsidered and dealt with as an attack on the whole line, an attack which concernsall affected parties alike. That seems to be a sensible opinion and one whichshould be taken to heart.Be it far from me to speak in challenging language here. To do so is notDutch, but neither would it be Dutch to let any doubt exist regarding our will to fight if necessary and regarding our readiness, should circumstances, &amp;c, leadthereto, to fight in alliance. That something similar, judging from theexpressions of Sir Robert Brooke-Popham which I have just quoted, will also be felt by the British Empire comes to our remembrance. That America will givehelp to those who show themselves willing to assist in a struggle againstunprovoked aggression we all know.
