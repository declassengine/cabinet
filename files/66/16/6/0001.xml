NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.Germany declared war on Yugoslavia and Greece early on the 6th April.There has been an increase of shipping losses during the week.The majority of the Italian naval forces in the Red Sea have been sunk orscuttled, though a few units which left Massawa before its capture are unlocated.The two German battle cruisers are still at Brest and both pocket battleshipshave been located at Kiel.Home Waters.2. Units of the Fleet have been disposed during the week so as to interceptthe battle cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, should they leave Brest, and tocover ocean convoys..Three German destroyers were located off Cape Gris Nez proceeding downchannel on the evening of the 5th April. M.T.B.&apos;s sent to attack them duringthe night failed to make contact; but on the following morning, when the destroyers were off Cherbourg, they were attacked by aircraft, and one was hit by a bomb which, however, was not seen to explode. Later 3 Beauforts attacked the destroyers with torpedoes and one was hit amidships.A fire broke out in the boiler room of H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Comorinon the afternoon of the 6th April when 400 miles to the westward of Ireland.The lire spread throughout the ship so that about midnight she had to be abandoned and was later sunk by torpedo.H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Worcestershire, reported damaged by torpedoin last week&apos;s Resume, has arrived at Liverpool.Portsmouth was attacked by enemy aircraft on the night of the 8th/9th.Small fires were caused in H.M.S. Vernon (Torpedo School) and H.M.S. Dolphin(Submarine Depot) and slight damage was done to the Dockyard.Mediterranean.3. The efficiency of enemy air attacks on shipping has increased. Since the22nd March five merchant ships have been sunk in convoy and one, thes.s. Northern Prince, had a valuable cargo.There was a heavy raid on the Piraeus by 10 German aircraft on the night of the 6th/7th which put the port completely out of action for several days.About a dozen mines were laid in the harbour, but H.M. Ships A jaw and Calcuttasuccessfully made their way out. The s.s. Clan Fraser, 7,529 tons, with 350 tonsof T.N.T. and a lighter alongside her with a further 100 tons, both blew up.Many fires were caused ashore and in ships in the harbour.During the week 14 French ships (50,000 tons) passed Gibraltar westboundand 10 ships (34,700 tons) passed eastbound, all under escort.Red Sea.4. Early on the 3rd April 4 Italian Destroyers were sighted by aircraft from H.M.S. Eagle to the eastward of Port Sudan, and the Nazario Sauro andDaniele Manin were bombed and sunk. Three officers and 39 of the crew of theDaniele Manin were picked up by H.M. Sloop Flamingo on the 6th April.The Pantera and Tigre were located 15 miles South of Jedda by H.M.Destroyer Kingston. The crews abandoned their ships after scuttling and landed at Jedda.Early on the 8th April seven enemy ships left Massawa and fired on our troops advancing up the coast. The destroyer Giovanni Acerbi was bombed in harbour by our aircraft and a near miss obtained. Massawa was occupied by our troops by 1300, and 10 to 12 ships, including small warships, left, 2 E-Boatsbein^ attacked by our aircraft. The floating; dock has been scuttled, the harbouris blocked and extensive demolition has been carried out.Er.M.S. Capetown was torpedoed in a boiler room by an E-boat during the night the 7th/8th, and has been towed to Port Sudan by H.M. Australian SloopParamatta.
Other Foreign Stations.North Atlantic.5.   H.M.S. Malaya arrived at New York on the 6th April for repair.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. Four attacks on U-boats by surface craft have been reported during theweek. U. 76 was sunk in the North-Western Approaches by H.M. DestroyerWolverine and ELM. Sloops Scarborough and A rbutus, four officers and 36 ratingsbeing taken prisoner. HM. Destroyer Lincoln and H.M. Trawlers Winder-mereand Vascania also made attacks without visible result.Further details have been received of the results of the attack made by H.M.Armed Boarding Vessel Visenda on the 23rd March (reported in Resume No. 82),,from which it appears that the U-boat was destroyed.Enemy Intelligence.German.7. Most of the main units of the German Fleet have been located in thecourse of the past week. The battle cruisers Gneisenau and Scharnhorst havebeen seen on various occasions at Brest, where they are still. It is known that theformer had come out of dry dock on the 6th April, and it seems likely that theship seen in dry dock on the following day was the Scharnhorst.Air reconnaissance showed the pocket battleships Admiral Scheer andLutzow and the 8-inch cruisers Hipper and Pnnz Eugen and an old battleshipof the Schlesien Class at Kiel on the 7th, and the new cruiser Seylidtz still fittingout at Bremen on the 8th. The 6-inch cruiser Emden and another of the LeipzigClass have been observed at Swinemunde. The second old Schlesien Class battle-ship was reported at Wilheimshaven. This leaves the two new battleshipsBismarck and Tirpitz unlocated, but it is thought likely that they are in theBaltic. The 6-inch cruiser Koln and another of the same size are, however,completely unaccounted for.Italian.8. It is possible that the destroyer Battisti may be still at large in theRed Sea. All the remainder are accounted for. Four submarines, 5 motor boats and 2 gunboats are known to have been at Massawa.With reference to paragraph 3.of last week&apos;s Resume, it is now known thatthe Italian destroyer Vittorio Alfiem, not the Vincenzo Giobert&amp;, was sunk duringthe Battle of Cape Matapan.U -Boats.9. There were ten or more German U-boats in the North-West Approachesduring the earlier part of the week, but later it seemed that not more than eightor nine were at work there, with another off Freetown and two southboundbetween the Azores and Canaries. Throughout the period under review therehas been little evidence of the Italians, though there may have been two in the azores-Madeira area during the latter part of the week.The attacks on a home-bound convoy from Canada during the 3rd and4th April were carried out by up to six U-boats successively, and this serious incident well illustrates the enemy tactics of concentrating rapidly upon anyConvoy which has been intercepted.It now appears reasonably probable from .the examination of prisoners ofwar that the U-Boat Commander Gunther Prieme was drowned in U. 76. He isthe third of the most distinguished German U-Boat Commanders to be eitherkilled or captured.U.S.A. Intelligence.10. The ten cruising cutters to be taken over from the United States Navywere completed between 1928 and 1932. Their length is 250 feet and their maximum speed 16-5 knots. Their range is 8,000 miles. They are fitted with american Asdics and carry two 5-inch guns and three 3-inch H/A guns.[22411] b
Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. According to the information at present available the merchant shipping losses during the week ended noon Wednesday, the 9th April, amounted to 23 ships and 2 small craft (118,485 tons), of which 18 ships and 2 small ships (99,169 tons)were British.Fourteen ships were sunk by U-boats, 10 of which were in a homeward bound convoy from Canada in the N.W. Approaches and 2 in Azores-Freetown area.Nine ships were sunk by aircraft attack, 3 of which were in the eastern mediterranean, and two ships were mined.Details are given in Appendix I of the losses and damage to ships of whichthere is accurate information. These losses total 214,373 tons, namely, 19 ships(95,709 tons) sunk during the current week which form part of the 25 shipsmentioned in the first paragraph, and the following earlier losses not previously reported : 15 ships (76,931 tons) sunk by surface raiders, 4 ships (24,571 tons) by -boats and 3 ships (17,162 tons) by aircraft.A graph showing the monthly loss of tonnage is attached to this Resume.12. Convoys on the East Coast were attacked by enemy aircraft every day during the week. Shipping was also attacked in the Channel, St. George&apos;s channel and N.W. Approaches, where one ship was possibly attacked by a torpedo-carrying aircraft.ELM. destroyers Valorous and Avon Vale each shot down an enemy aircraftwhile escorting convoys.Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. During the week ended noon Wednesday, the 2nd April, 663 ships,including 124 allied and 8 neutral, were convoyed. Two battleships, 6 cruisers,9 armed merchant cruisers, 59 destroyers, 51 sloops and corvettes and 5 submarines were employed on escort duties. Since the beginning of the war 59,390 ships have been convoyed, of which 289 have been lost by enemy action.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the5th April totalled 727,233 tons, compared with 557,429 tons during the previous seven days, and an average of 661,852 tons during the previous ten weeks. oil imports were 213,728 tons in 21 tankers. Imports of minerals were 187,402 tons,of which 124,039 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. Timberimports were 54,851 tons, a big increase of 45,303 tons, and cereal imports were182,689 tons. Twenty-three ships were fully laden with grain. Other food imports were 47,997 tons. There were 33,348 tons of sugar and molasses, 3,648tons of meat, and 2,786 tons of fruit. There were also considerable quantitiesof machinery and war materials among the cargoes.British Minelaying.14. On the 6th April H.M.S. Teviot Bank laid 270 mines in the East coast barrier. On the following day H.M.S. Plover laid 120 in the St. George&apos;s channel and H.M. Ships Southern Prince, Menestheus, Port Quebec and A gamemnon laid1,970 in the Iceland-Faroes area. On the 7th April H.M.S. Intrepid laid 32 offLe Treport.Minelaying by aircraft has continued, chiefly off the French Atlantic ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.15. Minelaying bv aircraft has been much more extensive this week than last. In addition to the usual areas the Humber, Thames Estuary, milford haven and Liverpool Bay all of which have been visited more than once duringthe week, mines have been dropped off Aberdeen, in the Firth of Forth, offHarwich, in the Thames, off the upper Bristol Channel ports, in the Clyde andoff Belfast. Minelaying has also been suspected off Norfolk and Suffolk and offFalmouth.During the recent heavy air raids on the Clyde, Liverpool, the Humber and london docks the enemy have dropped a considerable number of magnetic mines.These were dropped from several thousand feet and aimed to go into docks, basins
and narrow shipping channels or, alternately, to explode as bombs if they fellon the land. This form of attack is particularly dangerous, for not only arevaluable ships liable to be sunk, but vitally important channels and docks maybe blocked for long periods. Particular attention is therefore being given tothe organisation of mine watching and the reporting of mines.Twenty magnetic mines have been detonated during the week, forty-threeacoustic and one contact. The totals are now acoustic 484, magnetic 1,044.contact 849.Enemy Merchant Shipping.16. Of the 2 German and 28 Italian ships in U.S.A. ports, 1 German and25 Italian are now reported as seriously damaged.German.The s.s. Ramses, 7,983 tons, which was reported to have left Shanghaiescorted by Japanese destroyers on the 20th March, arrived at Kobe on the3rd April.The s.s. Elbe, 9,179 tons, sailed from Yokohama on the 8th April. A fewdays previously she had moved to the outer harbour, where a bulky object andcases were embarked.Italian.The s.s. Capo Alga, 4,723 tons, and the tanker Burano, 4,450 tons, whichsailed from Teneriffe in the Canary Islands on the night of the 1st April, were sighted heading south at dawn on the 2nd April, perhaps making for Dakar.MILITARY SITUATION.North-East Europe.17. Recent German troop movements to Denmark and a considerable increase in shipping in Copenhagen may indicate merely the passage of reinforce-ments to Norway and a change in the routing of shipping owing to the recentblocking of the Kiel Canal. On the other hand, these concentrations, taken inconjunction with the presence of Germany&apos;s main naval forces at Kiel and Brest,might indicate preparations for a raid. An alternative explanation might bethat Germany, by concentrating troops opposite Sweden and Finland, is tacitlywarning Russia that no interference Avith her Balkan activities will be tolerated.Spain.18. Spain at the moment has between 500,000 and 600,000 men under arms.Although much of her industry is devoted to the production of warlike stores,this army is still poorly equipped and possesses a heterogeneous collection ofmaterial accumulated during the Civil War.The main concentrations are some 8 divisions, totalling 150,000 troops, in spanish Morocco and 3 to 4 divisions, totalling about 100,000, in the South of spain.Balkan Operations.British Forces in Greece.19.   The following formations are now in Greece : 1st Armoured Brigade.2nd New Zealand Division.6th Australian Division (less one brigade which is en route).One battalion left Greece for Lemnos on the 3rd April.Germany.20 On the 27th March the Yugoslav coup oVEtat upset German Balkanplans, but the Germans had made preparations which could be adapted to new
circumstances, and by the 6th April they were ready and declared war on yugoslavia. The advances into Yugoslavia and Greece began simultaneouslyearly that morning.21. The attack on Greece was made in four sectors, towards Gumuljina(Komotini), Xanthe, Drama and Rupel. By the morning of the 9th the germans had reached the ^aegean south of Gumuljina and had taken Xanthe. South ofNevrokop and in the Struma Valley the Greeks offered a stubborn resistance and held up the German attack. The position of these troops was rendered acuteby the German occupation of Salonika on the 9th April.22. The forces which took Salonika had passed through the extreme south-east corner of Yugoslavia and down the Vardar Valley. Another line of advanceinto Yugoslavia was from Djumaya towards Stip and Veles and thereafter south-west towards Monastir with a view to separating the Yugoslav army from the greeks. The Germans are known to have reached Prilep on this line. further north, other German formations entering from Kustendil reached Skoplje late on the 7th April; a part of this force continued to advance westwards,presumably with the object of reaching Albania and joining up with the Italians.The remainder turned north and occupied Kacanik on the 9th April. Stillfurther north, a fourth line of advance was made from the direction of Sofiatowards Nis, and the Germans claimed to have taken Nis on the afternoon of the9th April. There is no confirmed report of any attack on Yugoslavia from roumania, Hungary or Austria, but the German communique of the 9th Aprilclaimed that Maribor (near the Austrian frontier) had been occupied.Italy.23. Despite Italy&apos;s avowed intention of collaborating with Germany againstYugoslavia, there has been, up to the present, little information of any military activity directed to this end. A report from Italian sources, but otherwise uncon-firmed, states that Italian forces have made a short advance in Yugoslav territorynear Tarvisio.In Albania, Italian activity on the Greek front has been mostly confined toartillery action. Certain minor withdrawals have taken place from this frontto the centre of Albania. There is no confirmation of the reported Yugoslavadvance against the Italian rear.Bulgaria.24. No substantial alterations have been made in the disposition of the bulgarian army, the bulk of which is posted on the Turkish frontier. german officers are believed to have been attached to all units in an attempt to preventrevolt and stop desertions.Turkey.25. There has been a movement westward of some of the German troops insouth-eastern Bulgaria, facing the Turkish frontier, showing that no attack isimminent.Meanwhile, there has been a further report of a German offer of territorialbribes to induce Turkey to renounce her connection with Britain, and of thepossibility of an agreement. The Turkish Foreign Minister has, however,categorically stated that there would be no question of allowing the passage ofGerman troops over the section of railway near Adrianople which passes throughTurkish territory.Africa.Libya.26. There have been indications of an increase in the strength of german troops in Libya. The following formations are believed to be there, or onthe way : One light (colonial) armoured division.One armoured division.Two infantry divisions, probably motorised (estimated only and notidentified).One armoured division reported to be still in Sicily but intended forLibya.
[22411]cOn the 2nd April German armoured forces attacked the flank of our forward troops in the Agedabia area. It soon became apparent that the enemy waslaunching a major offensive with armoured and motorised formations and, owingto the absence of suitable positions for defence in Western Cyrenaica, a generalwithdrawal was ordered to positions covering Tobruk.Benghazi was evacuated on the 3rd April after extensive demolitions of the docks and installations had been carried out. The withdrawal is proceeding, but some of our armoured troops, whose retirement was hampered by a severe duststorm, have been cut off.There are indications that the force of the enemy&apos;s thrust is diminishing andthat his administrative situation is acute.Eritrea and A abyssinia.27. On the 7th April the enemy withdrew from his prepared positioncovering Massawa and the town was occupied on the following day.Our mobile troops pursuing the enemy forces, who retired southwards afterthe surrender of Asmara, have occupied Adowa and Adigrat and have now reached Amalagi, 80 miles south of the latter place.28. After the capture of Diredowa, the advance westward along the Jibuti-Addis Ababa railway was continued. On the 3rd April East African troopsforced a crossing of the River Awash, the railway bridge over which had been destroyed by the Italians, and on the 5th April Addis Ababa was occupied.Since the occupation of the capital, operations have been confined to securingour position and restoring order.29. After the occupation of Asmara, Massawa and Addis Ababa it isbelieved that the remaining Italian forces may be withdrawing to Dessie,although certain numbers may have gone to Gimma. Without knowing thepresent state of the Italian garrison it is not possible to forecast how long it canhold out, but it is possible that towards the end there may be a wholesale flightto French Somaliland.Prior to the final stages of the operations described above, terms were offered to the Duke of Aosta with a view to safeguarding Italian civilians. Our terms,however, were not accepted and the operations proceeded.Far East.Indo-China.30. The Japanese have withdrawn from 3,500 to 5,000 troops from NorthIndo-China and there are reports that further withdrawals are contemplated.The number of Japanese troops remaining is now estimated at 12,000, all being in Tongking, north of the Red River.Warships and aircraft have also been withdrawn from South Indo-China.AIR SITUATION.General Review.31. Operations by Bomber Command have been on a much heavier scale,the principal attacks being made against Brest, Kiel and Berlin; our nightfighters had a successful week.The enemy made heavy night attacks on this country. In the Balkans andin Africa air operations were of considerable intensity. There is now a heavyconcentration of German aircraft in the Balkans.Germany and Occupied Territory.32. During the week Bomber Command carried out 157 day and 868 nightsorties. Coastal Command supported these operations and Fighter Commandflew offensive patrols over the coasts of Northern France and the low countries. The Photographic Reconnaissance Unit obtained a number ofvaluable photographs, including some of Kiel and Brest. At night, weather conditions were much more favourable than last week, and on only one nightwere all projected operations cancelled. We lost twenty-six bombers duringthe week.
The concentration of German aircraft in the Balkans is believed to havematerially weakened the fighter force in Northern Europe, the greater part ofwhich is iocated in the Calais area.Bay.33. The majority of our daylight sorties were directed against enemy shipping, details of which will be found under Coastal Operations.. Twoformations of heavy bombers were despatched during daylight to attack the enemybattle-cruisers at Brest; all except one aircraft abandoned this task on account ofunsuitable weather, and no results were observed.34. On two successive days formations of Blenheims attacked the iron andsteel works at Ijmuiden, some of the aircraft coming down to 100 feet; direct hits were obtained on buildings which were seen to be severely damaged; thepower house, ships and barges in the docks and a railway bridge were also attacked. Other aircraft, unable to locate shipping, bombed military objectives in France and Denmark; some successful results were obtained, including direct hits on two goods trains at Vemb and a bridge under construction nearRingkobing.35. During the week Fighter Command carried out twenty-five offensive patrols, involving 125 aircraft. Very few enemy aircraft were encountered, oneformation of thirty-five Spitfires meeting with no opposition. Two enemy aircraft were shot down, a number of others probably destroyed, and buildings, hangars,motor vehicles and aircraft on the ground were machine-gunned.Night.36. On three nights, a total of 215 aircraft were despatched to attack thetwo enemy battle-cruisers at Brest, and about 210 tons of H.E. bombs, including a number of very heavy ones, were dropped. On two occasions, cloud and hazeprevented observation of results and definite location of the ships; a large numberof bursts were, however, seen in the target area. On the third occasion, the weather was good and the ships clearly seen; one aircraft claims a direct hit witha 1,900-lb. general-purpose bomb and another, a very near miss; some burstsstraddled the ships and numerous fires were seen in the vicinity of the two docks.On one night, two Beauforts patrolled outside the harbour to attack the cruisersif they left port.37. In good weather, on the 7th/8th and the following night, a total of389 aircraft were despatched to attack the industrial centres and the principalnaval shipyards at Kiel. About 324 tons of H.E., including ninety-one 1,000-lb.,seven 2,000-lb. and eleven 1,900-lb. bombs were dropped. Ten Manchesters carriedforty 1,000-lb. H.E. bombs and 2,500 4-lb. incendiaries, of which a total ofabout 46,000 were dropped. As a result of the first attack on the industrial centres an area of about one square mile became a blazing inferno, numerous fires were caused on both sides of the estuary and in the areas of the naval shipyards.On the second night, the first aircraft over the target reported a few scatteredfires still burning, which soon developed into many very large ones, a pall ofsmoke practically enveloping the town.38. On the 9th/10th, eighty aircraft were despatched to attack the industrial centres of Berlin, and fifty-six aircraft were able to locate their primary targets.The district of Wedding, the Tempelhof aerodrome and marshalling yards, apoint in CSharlottenburg, the railway junction of Michendorf and the area ofthe inland port were successfully attacked. A total of about 44 tons of H.E.,including a number of heavy bombs, and over 11,000 incendiaries were dropped.39. On two nights, a total of forty-six aircraft was despatched to attackBremerhaven and on one night a lighter scale of attack was made against thenaval shipyards at Bremen. On three occasions, comparatively light attacks were made against Eniden and the petroleum harbour at Rotterdam. Six Hudsonsbombed the aluminium works and power-house at BZoyanger, and four Blenheims,the aerodrome at Stavangar, hitting the largest hangar. A number of alternativetargets were successfully attacked.
40. At night, Fighter Command carried out a number of offensive patrolsover aerodromes in the North of France, and over the Channel and French Coast.United Kingdom.41. Fighter Command flew 1,300 patrols, involving 3,245 sorties by day, and629 patrols, involving 854 sorties, by night. During the week enemy activityby day was on a small scale, but by night it was considerable, 1,225 enemy aircraftbeing employed, compared with 270 in the previous week. At least twenty-sixenemy bombers were destroyed at night, twenty-two of these being shot down by fighters.42. Enemy daylight operations consisted mainly of defensive patrols overthe Channel and attacks on shipping. On two days only were enemy aircraftreported overland.43. On five nights of the week there was considerable activity, the numberof enemy aircraft operating ranging between 160 and 395. The raids were wide-spread, but there were heavy concentrations on the Bristol, Birmingham, Coventryand Tyne areas. The enemy was also actively engaged in minelaying, the scale of effort on the night of the 4th/ 5th April being higher than for some time past.Coastal Operations.44. Coastal Command aircraft flew 285 patrols and provided escorts for167 convoys, involving a total of 968 sorties. In addition, Fighter Commandmade as many as 1,723 sorties on shipping protection patrols.45. As reported in the Naval Situation, Coastal Command aircraft made anumber of successful attacks on shipping. Aircraft attacked three enemy destroyers entering the harbour at Cherbourg; one of the destroyers was hit onthe bow by a 500-lb. bomb which was not seen to explode. On the same day, aBeaufort torpedoed an enemy destroyer off Morlaix. Another attacked one offive merchant vessels of about 1,000 tons, south-west of Lodbierg; observa-tion was difficult, but a hit, is believed to have been made. North of the he de Bas, five Beauforts attacked a- merchant vessel of 3,000 tons escorted by naval units; although the vessel was hit with a torpedo, it was not seen to sink.A trawler was hit off the Brittany coast and two trawlers were hit off the Danishcoast. Numerous other attacks were made on shipping, but results were eitherunsuccessful or could not be observed.During the week mines were laid off Brest, St. Nazaire, La Pallice and the frisian Islands.46.   It is estimated that about 250 enemy aircraft laid mines, principallyin the Thames Estuary, in the Humber area and off the East Coast.  Enemy long-. range bombers continued attacks against shipping; details are given in the naval situation.The Balkans.47. On the 6th/7th April, six Wellingtons attacked the main railway junction and the marshalling yard at Sofia. Several fires and explosions were caused and railway trucks were blown into the air. Our Blenheims havepersistently and successfully bombed enemy transport on roads and railways inthe Struma, Strumitsa and Vardar Valleys. Hurricanes have also been active and have continuously harassed enemy transport and troops. On the 6th April,twelve Hurricanes intercepted a large formation of Me. 109&apos;s over the RupelPass and destroyed five of them without loss.48. During the period, strong enemy reinforcements, consisting of single-engined fighters and dive-bombers, proceeded to Northern Roumania and Bulgaria.There are now about 900 German aircraft in the Balkans (including 300 long-range bombers, 165 dive-bombers and 330 fighters), over 500 of which have arrivedduring the last fortnight, aircraft having been withdrawn from Sicily and
Tripolitania, as well as from Northern Europe. Elements of two Geschwaderof long-range bombers are also in South-East Germany, and part of this forcemay be moved to Bulgaria. The movement of operational units to advanced areas has been accelerated by the extensive use of transport aircraft, of which about400 are believed to be engaged.49. There are probably three operational commands, the main one being in bulgaria and the other two being in Northern Roumania and South-east germany. The first operations against Yugoslavia and Greece were carried outby the Bulgarian component. This consisted of dive-bomber and fighter support to land forces attacking in the Rupel Pass and to a lesser extent in the Skopljearea. Attacks were also made against bases of the Yugoslav Air Force and rearcommunications.50. Heavy and damaging attacks on Belgrade started at dawn on the 6thand continued throughout the day. Some night bombing was carried out by theenemy on the 6th/7th April, including the raid on the Piraeus reported in tlheNaval Situation. On the 7th April, the role of the German Air Force continuedto be mainly close support for the Army, but attacks were continued againstaerodromes and communications. On the 8th, air activity was hindered by bad weather conditions in the battle area, but some assistance was given to armoured forces. In the Rupel Pass area the Germans employed some 200 parachutists,the whole force being either killed or captured.51. On the 3rd, German dive-bombers escorted by Me. 109&apos;s attacked Corfuthree times; they probably operated from Lecce, north of Otranto, and this is thefirst report of German aircraft in this area. On the 4th, Italian fighters machine-gunned the aerodrome at Heraklion (Crete), destroying several cases of ammu-nition.   One enemy aircraft was shot down by A.A. fire.Malta.52. Enemy operations against Malta consisted almost entirely ofreconnaissance by bomber and fighter aircraft. The only attack was made onthe 3rd April, when four Ju. 88 s escorted by Me. 109&apos;s attacked naval units,only inflicting superficial damage on one vessel. Our aircraft carried outreconnaissances of the Libyan and Tunisian coasts and of several naval bases in Italy.Egypt and Libya.53. Our main operations have been to harass enemy columns and to bombTripoli, the principal enemy disembarkation port. Tripoli harbour was attackedthree times, and direct hits were registered on the wireless and power stations.Heavy casualties were inflicted on enemy transport. On the 7th April, five ofour aircraft bombed a concentration of German lorries and armoured cars nearJedabya, scoring several direct hits, and, on the following day, five bomberssuccessfully attacked armoured cars and troop-carrying vehicles on the Msus-Mechili road. On the 9th, Hurricanes machine-gunned Derna and destroyedeight aircraft, including six He. Ill, on the ground. Four days earlier, a german attack on the same aerodrome had damaged six of our own aircraft.In spite of the fact that our aircraft have been operating under conditionsof extreme difficulty, they have inflicted severe losses on the enemy. In one dayHurricanes of the Royal Australian Air Force shot down twelve German aircraft.No Italian air operations are reported.Italian East Africa.54. Our aircraft have kept up constant attacks on road and rail communi-cations, on aerodromes and on strong points. The aerodromes at Addis Ababa,Dessie and Combolcia, near Dessie, were bombed several times, and many enemy aircraft were destroyed and damaged on the ground. Prior to the occupation ofMassawa, our aircraft heavily bombed enemy positions and gun emplacementson Mount Umberto and attacked ships in the harbour which were shelling ouradvancing troops; one ship received a direct hit. Thirty-six damaged aircraft were found on Addis Ababa aerodrome when the Capital was taken.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.55. No enemy bombing took place on four days of this period. On the3rd April, Leeming Aerodrome was attacked, and damage was caused to therailway at Newhaven. On the 5th April a food factory at Fraserburgh was hit and some casualties inflicted on the workers. Other minor incidents caused no serious damage or casualties.By Night.56. On the 5th/6th and 6th/7th April bombing was of a negligible nature,but on the other nights was of a more serious character.On the 3rd/4th April a heavy incendiary attack lasting about three hourstook place at Bristol and Avonmouth, causing about thirty fires. A number of places were also bombed in the north, many fires being started at Hull.On the 4th/5th April Bristol and Avonmouth were again bombed, but the damage was small except at the National Smelting Works, Avonmouth. Minorincidents occurred in other. On the 7th/8th April widespread bombing occurred in every region, the chiefconcentration being on the Clyde and Forth Areas.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources :  Germany.Emden. Photographs of the 5th April show clearly the effect of the two4,000-lb. bombs that have been dropped.One fell in the East part of the town in an area bounded by the FaldernDelft in the South and the Alter Graben in the North. This area contains the telephone exchange, the post and telegraph offices and many houses, all of whichhave been destroyed or certainly made uninhabitable. The centre of the damagedarea lies between the post and telegraph offices and the telephone exchange, these buildings being severely damaged if not demolished. This central area of damagemeasures approximately 100 yards by 80 yards. A much larger area shows majordamage       result of blast.The other bomb fell in the old town, and a &apos;&apos; whitened &apos;&apos; area (an area whichhas completely disappeared) is shown on the photographs. This &quot;whitened&quot;area measures 60 yards by 80 yards and originally contained about 30 to35 houses, of which no trace remains. The area affected by blast is in this caselarger than that in the Eastern part of the town. It is of interest that crowdsof spectators have gathered in the surrounding streets and in the town gardensto view this area, which is apparently cordoned off.The photographs disclose numerous other items of minor damage to the town,and it is not surprising that the German High Command communique on this occasion admitted severe damage to &quot; a town in N.W. Germany.&quot;Gelsenkirchen.
