MOST SaCREToM E M 0 R A N D U M.The President is concerned at the possibility ofraids &quot;by surfaca naval vessels against Newfoundland, Bermuda^and Trinidad which might in addition to local damage adversely affect the construction of the United States bases in thoseislands,,    He asked the Secretary of War to jprepare plans for sending additional United States forces to those islands as quickly as possible.    The Secretary of War giving full weight to the existing defences in those islands has recommended thedispatch of the following forces and the President has approved-subject to the concurrence of the British Government.Newfoundland,,    One half battery of 8 inch guns (tobe mounted in St. Johns), one squadron consisting of 3 medium and 3 heavy bombardment airplanes;   &quot;approximately 57 offioers -and 575 men to sail with equipment from New York on thetransport AMERICAN LEGION, April 18, arriving in St. JohnsApril 20,Bermuda,,    One &apos; . attery 8 inch guns;    one battery155 mm.  guns,;    one company of infantry;    with necessary servicestotalling approximately 50 officers and 975. men to sail from new York on the transport AMERICAN LEGION, April 27, arrivingabout April 290Trinidad.    One squadron medium bombardment planeswith approximately 46 officers and 385 men to sail from the canal Zone on the transport CHATEAU THIERRY on April 20,arriving at Trinidad pn April 24;    two batteries of 155 mm.guns and one company., of infantry with the necessary servicestotalling approximately 75 officers and 1,100 men to sail from new York on the transport LEONARD WOOD on April 28,  arriving at Trinidad on May 3.Camp sites are available or can be prepared for the accommodation of these forces except at Bermuda.    At Bermudait is understood that the Castle Harbor Hotel owned bythe Bermuda Development Company is at present unoccupied.It would be appreciated if the British authorities could takeover this hotel and lease it to the War Department until campfacilities are available.&apos; It is proposed to discuss the dispatch of theabove mentioned forces to Newfoundland informally with theCanadian authorities and to mount the 8 inch guns at St.  Johnsafter consultation with their officers in that city.    Theplanes destined to Newfoundland will occupy quarters constructedfor their use by the Canadian Government.LONDON, April 8,   1941,

SECRET.PRIME MINISTER.With reference to the Memorandum by the american ambassador, the Chiefs of Staff would be very glad to  seesthe defences of Trinidad strengthened as Boon aspossible, in view of the vital oil supplies at that place and of the fact that it is at presentinadequately defended.2. The Chiefs of Staff regard an attack onNewfoundland as an unlikely and unprofitableoperation for the enemy to undertake, but theCanadian authorities have expressed nervousnessthat such an attack will take place, and therefore the proposed defences would be welcome.3. At Bermuda also, the Chiefs of Staff regardan attack as unlikely, but nevertheless theadditional defences would be all to the good.4. There is another point.       This Americanparticipation in the defence of these localitieswould align them still closer with us in the war.5. On military grounds, therefore, the Chiefsof Staff have no hesitation in recommending that. His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree to theproposals.6. Meanwhile, the Chiefs of Staff are considering the machinery for local consultation as regards the siting of the defences.. 7. Presumably the Colonial Office will take up the question of the leasing of the CastleHarbour Hotel,(Signed) H.L.  ISMAY.8th April, 1941.
