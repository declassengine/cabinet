naval SITUATION.&apos;General Review.The Italian Fleet has been brought to action and has suffered serious losses.The scuttling of enemy merchant shipping in South America is reported.Shipping losses reported are heavy, but more than half this tonnage was sunkprevious to the period under review.Enemy aircraft have been active in attacking tra.de in the St. George&apos;s channel and off the East Coast.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2. Units of the Fleet have been employed during the week covering oceanconvoys and patrols have been instituted to intercept warship raiders. On the.27th March H.M. Sloop Leith was unsuccessfully attacked in the St. George&apos;s channel by two aircraft, one of which was destroyed. On the 31st two hits were claimed b)^ our aircraft on a destroyer which was escorting a convoy off the North coast of Holland. H.M. Paddle Minesweeper Lorna Doone off Lowestoft destroyedone aircraft and claimed to have damaged two others. H.M.S. Worcestershire(Armed Merchant Cruiser), escorting a homebound convoy from Canada, was damaged by torpedo 400 miles south-west of Iceland early on the morning of the3rd April. The convoy was also attacked, eight ships having been reportedtorpedoed, further details of which will be included in next week&apos;s Resume. Onthe same day H.M. Gunboat Locust destroyed one aircraft and damaged two others in the Thames Estuary.Mediterranean.3. Air reconnaissance on the 27th March reported a force of enemywarships to the eastward of Sicily steering east. On the morning of the28th March our light forces sighted one Littorio class battleship, accompanied bycruisers, to the south-west of Crete steering south-east, while air reconnaissancereported two battleships, cruisers and destroyers to the north of this position.On being sighted the enemy turned westward, proceeding at high speed. Duringthe day the Littorio class battleship was repeatedly and successfully attacked with torpedoes by the Fleet air arm which caused serious damage. A successful attack was also made by bombers of the R.A.F. on cruisers and destroyers. Theloss of speed resulting from these air attacks enabled our heavier ships to gaincontact with the enemy at dusk, and a short but decisive action took place,resulting in the loss of three enemy 8-inch cruisers (Pola, Zara and Fiume) andtwo destroyers, Vincenzo Gioberti and Maestrale. It is probable that the 6-inch cruiser Giovanni Delle Bancle Nere and one other destroyer were also sunk. Twodive-bombers were shot down during daylight operations. Apart from threeNaval aircraft which are missing, no damage or casualties were sustained by anyof our ships. On the morning of the 29th nearly a thousand Italian survivorswere rescued, which number would have been considerably increased had notGerman bombers attacked the rescuing ships. The Commander-in-Chief informed the Chief of the Italian Naval Staff of the position of the survivors, which hehad been forced to abandon, and suggested that a hospital ship should be sent.A reply of thanks was received indicating that the hospital ship Piscana hadalready sailed. Greek destroyers which were rushed through the Corinth Canalarrived too late to take part in the action, but assisted to pick up survivors.Opposing forces consisted of British : three battleships, one aircraft carrier,four cruisers and twelve destroyers; Italian : three battleships, eleA^en cruisers and fourteen destroyers.4. HM. Submarine Parthian attacked an escorted convoy in the Straits ofMessina on the 16th March, and it is believed that she torpedoed a 6,000-ton merchant ship and a 10,000-ton tanker. H.M. Submarine Rorqual, operatingnorth of Messina, reported that she had sunk a U-Boat and the Italians.s. Laura Corrado (3,645 tons). H.M. Submarine Utmost, operating in theCentral Mediterranean, attacked a southbound convoy, and obtained two hits ona 12,000-ton ship and one on a 6,000-ton ship.
Early on the 31st March H.M.S. Bonaventure was torpedoed and sunk by aU-Boat while escorting a convoy south of Crete. The Captain, nine officers and300&apos;ratings have been rescued. ELM. Australian Destroyer Stuart attacked theU-Boat, which broke surface and then crash dived after the third attack.Reinforcements of aircraft which were flown off H.M.S. Ark Royal arrivedsafely at Malta on the morning of the 3rd.5. On the 30th March H.M.S. Sheffield with four destroyers intercepted aneastbound convoy of four French merchant ships, escorted by a destroyer, off theAlgerian coast. The convoy refused to stop, and entered Nemours, where a -inch battery opened fire on our ships. Sheffield replied, and the battery wasrepeatedly hit. Our force was ineffectively bombed by French aircraft whilereturning to its base.Other Foreign Stations.South A atlantic.6. It has now been established that the enemy raider reported byH.M. Submarine Severn on the 22nd March was, in fact, a British merchant ship.Red Sea.7. On the 30th March H.M. Destroyer Kandahar intercepted the Germans.s. Bertram Rickmers (4,188 tons) 60 miles south-west of Massawa. The crewabandoned ship and fired scuttling charges. Two Italian Destroyers attempting to escape from Massawa have been sunk by aircraft from H.M.S. Eagle. Anotherdestroyer was left in a sinking condition and two others have been abandoned,leaving three still to be accounted for.Pacific.8. On the 1st April H.M. Canadian Armed Merchant Cruiser Prince Henryintercepted the German ships munchen (5,619 tons) and Hermonthis (4,833 tons)about 200 miles west of Callao. Both ships were set on fire by their crews andwere subsequently sunk.Anti-Submarine Operations.9. No attacks of importance have taken place other than those previouslydescribed in the Mediterranean Section.Enemy Intelligence.German.10. On the 28th March an unconfirmed report placed the new battleshipBismarck in Gdynia, and on the following day photographic reconnaissanceshowed the battle cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau in Brest, the former along-side with net protection round her and the latter in dry dock. Subsequent recon-reconnaissances have reported no change in this situation.Italian.Nine destroyers were at Massawa previous to the attacks by our aircraftreported in paragraph 7. Confirmation has been received that the 6-inch cruiserMontecuccoli was sunk early in March in the Mediterranean.A reconnaissance of Tripoli on the 28th March showed six destroyers and19 merchant ships varying from 2,000 to 8,000 tons.U-boats.At the beginning of the period under review, there seemed to be considerablyfewer German U-boats in the North-West Approaches than has been usual of late.By the 30th March, there seem to have been ten or more Germans at work in two groups, one North of 60o and one South of 55G, and numbers have remained atleast at that level since then. A feature of the dispositions towards the end ofthe period was the presence in Northern latitudes of two German U-boats as farWest as 280. One or two Germans have been in the Cape Verde area. Therehas been little evidence of the activity of Italian U-boats, but it seems that the concentration in the Bay of Biscay has dispersed.[22392] b
Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. According to the information at present available merchant shipping losses during the week ended noon Wednesday, the 2nd April, amounted to tenships and five small craft totalling 53,446 tons, of which eight ships and threesmall craft (42,962 tons) were British. Bombing, principally on the East coast and in the St. George&apos;s Channel, accounted for five ships and five small craftsunk and ten ships damaged. Four ships were sunk by U-boats in the North-Western Approaches and two were damaged. Only one ship was damaged by mine.  A merchant raider sank one British ship in the South Atlantic.Information has also come to hand during this week of a number of earlierlosses not previously reported, namely, two ships sunk by U-boats, two ships andsome small craft sunk by aircraft, and three ships sunk by raider. Seven shipspreviously reported damaged are now known to have been sunk, making a totalof 128,466 tons of shipping sunk, details of which are contained in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade.12. During the week ended noon Wednesday, the 2nd April, 774 ships,including 163 Allied and 16 neutral, were convoyed. Four ships were reported lost in convoy. Five battleships, one aircraft carrier, three cruisers, foursubmarines, fifty destroyers and forty-five sloops and corvettes were employedon escort duties. Since the beginning of the war 58,727 ships have been convoyed,of which 285 have been lost by enemy action.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the29th March totalled 557,429 tons, compared with 502,789 tons during the previous seven days. Oil imports were 134,703 tons in thirteen tankers. Imports of minerals were 155,816 tons, of which 112,192 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig ironand iron ore. Timber imports were 9,548 and cereal imports were 88,460 tons.Other food imports amounted to 92,081 tons, of which 13,666 tons were sugar,12,234 tons were refrigerated and tinned meat, bacon and hams, and 13,011 tons were tea. Aircraft and considerable quantities of machinery and war stores wereamong the cargoes.British Minelaying.13. During the week three minelaying operations have been carried out offBrest and 240 mines have been laid in the St. George&apos;s Channel. M.T.Bs. laidmines off Dunkirk.Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out off the Frisian and FrenchAtlantic coasts.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.14. Both the Humber area and Milford Haven have had minelaying raids on three nights during the week ended the 2nd April. Minelaying off Hartlepoolwas suspected on the night of the 31st March.No contact mines have been cut or exploded during the week, and only ninemagnetic and fourteen acoustic mines have been detonated, the majority in theUpper Thames Estuary.Three dangerous areas in the Downs have been cleared, leaving a small patchnear some wrecks.An enemy minefield is suspected off Cape Carvoeiro on the coast of Portugal,where several explosions have recently been reported.On the 3rd April Torbay was the only port closed.Enemy Merchant Shipping.15. Italian, German and Danish ships in United States ports have beentaken into protective custody after information had been received to the effectthat Italian crews were systematically destroying their machinery. Whenboarded many of the Italian ships were found to have already made preparations for setting themselves on fire or to have damaged their engines. There are28 Italian ships in United States ports, totalling 169,906 tons, 2 German, one
of them a tanker, totalling 9,133 tons, and 35 Danish, totalling 113,517 tons.No damage had been done to the Danish ships, but one of the German, the PauleineFriedrich at Boston, had had her engines badly damaged. Three Danish ships have recently been seized in Chile and one in Peru.German.16. The Wartenfels (6,181 tons) is reported to have left Massawa betweenthe 21st February and the 21st March, but has not been heard of since. Dresden(5,567 tons) sailed from Santos on the 28th March. At Montevideo the Norderney(3,667 tons) was ready for sea, heavily loaded, on the 1st April. Osomo(6,951 tons) sailed from Talcahuano, Chile, on the 2nd April. The GermanEisenach (4,423 tons) and the Italian Fella (6,072 tons) were set on fire by theircrews at Punta Arenas, Costa Rica, on the 31st March when the local authoritiesattempted to board. Both ships are likely to become a total loss. Reports ofscuttling have also been received as follows : Sesostris (3,987 tons) at Puerto Cabello, Venezuela.Friesland (6,310 tons) set on fire at Paita, Peru.Leipsig (5,898 tons) at Callao.Cerigo (1,120 tons) set on fire at Quayaguil, Ecuador.The Orinoco (9,660 tons) at Tampico, Hameln (4,174 tons) at Vera Cruz andDurazzo (1,153 tons) in Venezuela have been seized.Italian.17. Considerable activity has been shown by Italian ships in the CanaryIslands. On the night of the 1st April the Capo Alga (4,835 tons) and the tankerBurano (4,450 tons) sailed from Teneriffe. The tanker Frisco (4,910 tons) sailed from Ceara, Brazil, and the tanker Franco Martelli (10,535 tons) fromPernambuco on the 28th March. Six ships, totalling 36,873 tons, are reportedto have received orders to sail from Buenos Aires.Reports of scuttlings have been received as follows : -Tanker A tlas (2,005 tons) at Tampico.Tankers Teresa Odero (8,196 tons), Trottiera (6,205 tons) and Jole Fassio(5,169 tons) at Puerto Cabella, Venezuela.Manserrate (5,578 tons) at Callao.Eight tankers (51,000 tons) have been seized at Tampico and one tanker(6,735 tons) at Vera Cruz. The Recca (5,441 tons) at Havana, Bacicin Padre(5,591 tons) and two tankers (12,000 tons) at Puerto Cabello have also been seizedand Pampano (6,232 tons) at Pernambuco has been detained for payment ofbunkers.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.18. A study of German man-power statistics indicates that her army is nowapproaching a total of 250 divisions. It is thought that this is the maximumwhich she can maintain without serious risks to her war production and supply.Balkan Operations.Greece.19. A German attack on Greece appeared to be imminent at the time thatYugoslavia joined the Tripartite Pact. There is no doubt that the coup d&apos; Etatwhich followed upset the German calculations and caused postponement of the attack. It is suggested that the attack on Greece will coincide with one on yugoslavia.Yugoslavia.20. It appears that German troops are being concentrated on the Yugoslavfrontiers as follows : (a) A higher formation, probably an armoured corps, is being concentrated in the Temesvar area, i.e., in Roumania opposite the Yugoslav frontier.Units from France are also concentrating in this area.
(b) It was reported on the 29th March that German motorised units werearriving by train and road at Eeldbach and Leibnitz in SouthernAustria, opposite the Yugoslav frontier.(c) Certain German troop trains are being halted in Hungary.   It is there-fore possible that German troops are detraining in Hungary andmoving south to the Hungarian-Yugoslav frontier. So far, however,there is no confirmation of this.There is no confirmation of press reports of hasty reinforcement by Italy ofthe Italo-Yugoslav frontier.Albania.21. The effect of the Yugoslav coup d:Etat on Italian strategy in Albaniacannot yet be assessed, although certain troops may have been withdrawn fromthe&quot; front to the centre of Albania to form a strategic reserve. Meanwhile, theItalians have kept up minor offensive activities on all parts of the front without success and at some cost in personnel and war material.Bulgaria.22. There are estimated to be twenty complete German divisions now in bulgaria, as against sixteen last week, the probable present distribution beingsix divisions in the south-west, six in the centre and eight in the south-east facingTurkey. Of these four are armoured divisions, an increase of one during thepast week.U.S.S.R.23. There is little reason to believe numerous reports that Germany intends to attack Russia in the near future. The German object is undoubtedly to exertmilitary pressure on Russia to prevent Russian interference in German plans inSouth-East Europe, and also to influence Russia&apos;s diplomatic decisions.Africa.Libya.24. Enemy infantry estimated at two battalions, together with tanks withswastika markings, attacked some of our unarmoured troops who withdrew to aline north of Agedabia.We estimate that the number of German troops in Tripoli is still between one and two armoured divisions, but there are indications that these may shortly be reinforced.Eritrea and A abyssinia.25. The outstanding events of the week have been the capture of Keren andthe capitulation of Asmara. With our forces astride the railway Addis Ababa-Jibuti, the only land exit from Abyssinia left to the Italians is by road fromAddis Ababa to Assab via Dessie, It is evident that the Duke of Aosta isinterpreting his orders loyally and that he will probably exploit the nuisancevalue of containing our forces until Italian surrender is inevitable.AIR SITUATION.General Review.26. Operations by Bomber Command have been greatly restricted by very bad weather; a heavy attack, however, was made against the Scharnhorst andGneisenau located at Brest. A number of successful attacks were made on enemy shipping by aircraft from both Bomber and Coastal Commands.Operational Aircraft Battle Casualties are given in Appendix VI. for reasons given in Appendix VII, extracts from recent Raid Assessment reports are not to be discontinued, as was stated last week.
Germany and Occupied Territory.27. During the week Bomber Command carried out 115 day and 289 nightsorties. Coastal Command supported these operations and Fighter Commandflew a few offensive patrols over the coasts of France and the Low Countries.Day.28. Nearly all the daylight sorties were directed against enemy shipping,details of which will be found under Coastal Operations. On four occasionsduring daylight, a force of heavy bombers was despatched to attack the enemybattle cruisers located at Brest; one aircraft attacked without observing results,the remainder had to abandon task on account of unsuitable weather. A fewaerodromes were bombed and machine-gunned; at Haamstede a building was hit,causing a large explosion, and at Maupertus four He. Ill were machine-gunned.A direct hit was made on gun emplacements at flollum, in Ameland. Near thispoint some Dutch civilians were seen pointing and waving; our aircraftinvestigated and found a number of enemy soldiers on parade, who were thenbombed and machine-gunned.Night.29. Weather conditions during the week were very unfavourable; on only three nights was it possible to carry out attacks and on only one night could thefull programme be undertaken.30. On the night of the 27th/28th a total of 97 bombers was despatched,the principal attacks being made against the industrial centres at Cologne andDusseldorf. Forty-nine tons of H.E. bombs were dropped at Cologne;several large explosions took place near the electricity power station, bursts were seen amongst buildings, and a large fire was observed. At Dusseldorf,thirty tons of H.E. were dropped and many fires and explosions were seen in the target area. Attacks on a small scale were also made against Dunkirk,Brest and Calais.31. On the night of the 30th/31st March, a total of 134 bombers was despatched, the principal target being the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at Brest,where 118 tons of H.E. were dropped. Results were difficult to observe onaccount of darkness and intense searchlight concentration, but reports indicatethat a large proportion of the bombs were dropped on that area of the docks inwhich these battle cruisers were situated. A number of aircraft saw the cruisers by the light of flares, and other aircraft report having straddled the target in all directions. Thirteen Wellingtons attacked Calais, starting a numberof fires.32. On the night of the 31st/1st twenty-two aircraft attacked shipyards atBremen; fires were observed in the dock area and bursts were seen exactly on the target. A lighter scale of attack was made against Emden, where two 4,000-lb.bombs were dropped.33. On two occasions tea bags were dropped over Holland, and propaganda leaflets were dropped over North-West France and Emden.United Kingdom.34. Fighter Command flew 1,120 patrols, involving 2,730 sorties, by day,and 189 patrols, involving 285 sorties, by night.35. Enemy operations by day were on the same moderate scale as last week,though increased activity took place against shipping off the West and South-West Coasts. The Focke-Wulf long-range unit has again been active. Singlebomber-reconnaissance aircraft have attacked nine Royal Air Force stations, forthe most part ineffectively, and bombs have been dropped in some coastal towns.Warmwell aerodrome was attacked on the 1st April by three aircraft, which caused some damage, details of which are recorded in the Home Security Situation.Weather conditions were generally unfavourable for interception, but our fighters destroyed at least eight enemy bombers during the week.[22392] c
36. By night, enemy activity was on a considerably reduced scale. The onlyattacks of importance during the week were directed against Avonmouth andHull; not more than forty aircraft were engaged on each occasion. Our fightersmade two interceptions, one of which resulted in damage to a Focke-Wulf off theCornish coast.Coastal Operations.37. Coastal Command aircraft flew 179 patrols and provided escorts for142 convoys, involving a total of 798 sorties. In addition, aircraft of fighter command made 478 sorties in convoy and shipping protection patrols. Ourattacks in daylight on enemy shipping have been on a heavier scale, and have beencarried out by aircraft of both Bomber and Coastal Commands.38- Six Coastal Command aircraft attacked a small merchant vessel inAlderney Harbour, obtaining three direct hits; the jetty was damaged and aburst was observed near a large warehouse. Off St. Nazaire, an anti-submarinevessel was set on fire and seen to be sinking. Five Blenheims escorted by foursquadrons of fighters bombed two small merchant vessels off Cape Gris Nez andregistered near misses. Off the Danish coast, a Beaufort torpedoed a merchant vessel of about 2,000 tons. A Blenheim on reconnaissance engaged and shot downone of three enemy bombers,39. The destroyer attacked off the north coast of Holland by bomber command aircraft (mentioned in the Naval Situation) was left listing heavilywith smoke issuing from the stern. Two tankers, each of 3,000 tons, were attacked off Havre and set on fire, and a direct hit was made on a 2,000-ton merchant vessel off Ijmuiden. Two flak ships were hit, one was seen to be listingwith smoke and steam pouring from it and the other was left down by the stern.Numerous other attacks were made on shipping; some near misses were seen, but other results could not be observed.   Enemy ships were also machine-gunned.40. During the week, thirty-three mines were laid off Brest; other seamining operations were carried out;off Ameland.41. It is estimated that about 170 enemy aircraft laid mines mostly in the humber area and off the East Coast. Forty of these operated in daylight, on the1st April. Enemy long-range bombers continued their attacks against shipping,principally off the East Coast and in the St. George&apos;s Channel.During March, the Condor Unit carried out its highest number of sortiesyet recorded. The most effective attacks on shipping during the past month havebeen made by a He. Ill unit based at Tours, using advanced bases at Brest andDinard and operating against shipping in the Western Approaches. during march, this unit carried out a considerably greater number of sorties during daylight than any other grwppe in the German Air Force.Eastern Mediterranean.42. At dawn on the 28th March, a machine-gun attack was made by sixfighters on the aerodrome at Lecce, twenty-five miles south-east of Brindisi, andone aircraft was destroyed and twenty were damaged. Reference has been madein the Naval Situation to the attack on the Italian Fleet later that day bynineteen Blenheims.Greece and Albania.43. Operations continued in support of the Greek forces, and many offensive and photographic reconnaissances were flown in the area between Tepelene andthe coast. On the 30th, a heavy and successful attack was made by ten Blenheimson military stores at Elbasan, during which three of our aircraft were damaged by fighters and one by A.A. fire. On the following day,, six Blenheims, escorted by fighters, bombed transport on the Buzi-Glave road, scoring many hits.Barracks and military stores in Tepelene were attacked on the 2nd by sixBlenheims escorted by twelve Gladiators. Italian activity has been confined to afew attacks, on Greek aerodromes and on various towns. Of four Cant Z 1007bombers which attempted to raid Volos on the 2nd, three were destroyed by our fighters and the fourth severely damaged.
About thirty of the forty-five Italian bombers in Albania are being with-drawn to Italy.Dodecanese.44. On the 27th, an attack was made by eleven Blenheims on the aerodrome at Calato, Rhodes; an enemy aircraft was destroyed on the ground and buildings and a petrol dump set on fire. Shipping off Astropalia was bombed by fiveBlenheims with inconclusive results.Malta.45. Offensive operations against Malta have been on a lower scale than during the previous week and no dive-bombers have been in evidence. Daylightactivity consisted of reconnaissance by single bombers and fighters, and oneineffective bombing attack on Takali aerodrome by four escorted bombers. Enemyfighter patrols were maintained off the coast and, on the occasion of the attackon Takali, a mixed force of German and Italian fighters operated east of theGrand Harbour, probably with a view to diverting our fighters. Two night attacks were made during the week, but only slight civilian damage resulted.Egypt and Libya.46. Our offensive operations were not on a heavy scale, but Tripoli was attacked by Wellingtons on four successive nights, and damage was inflicted on shipping and in the dock areas. Successful daylight attacks were carried out byBlenheims on enemy aerodromes at Misurata and Ras Lanuf, and at the latterplace heavy damage was inflicted on motor transport.47. Frequent reconnaissances by Me. 110s were carried out over Agedabyaand the areas south-east to Gialo, and aircraft believed to be German attackedour forces in this area. On the 31st March, the biggest German air effort of thewar in this area was put forward. Two formations totalling about thirty-fivedive-bombers with fighter escorts operated in the Mersa El Brega area and on thesame day Italian bombers, escorted by German fighters, attacked our aerodrome atAgedabya, causing a few casualties and damaging one aircraft. One of theenemy fighters was destroyed and three bombers were damaged. Single italian aircraft have reconnoitred Alexandria.Italian East Africa.48. In Eritrea, following the fall of Keren, British air activity was trans-ferred to the Asmara area, where intensive operations have continued in supportof our advance. Asmara itself was heavily bombed, and pressure has been main-tained against enemy concentrations, defences and communications. TheAddis-Jibuti railway was repeatedly bombed, and enemy aerodromes and motor transport on roads in Eastern Abyssinia have been attacked.49. Italian fighters and bombers attacked our aerodrome at Jijiga on three occasions, losing at least two of their number, but damaging eight of our aircraft.It is believed that the Italians have now ceased sending air reinforcements to east Africa. Their present strength there is estimated at twenty-five bombers and twenty fighters, of which not more than twelve of each type are likely to beserviceable.Air Intelligence.The Balkans.50. Recent changes in the dispositions of the German Air Force indicatethat the main concentration is being made against Yugoslavia. Sixty additionalshort-range fighters are being moved to within seven miles of the Yugoslav-Roumanian frontier, half from France and half from Norway.The projected move of forty additional dive bombers into the area, referredto in paragraph 48 (a) of last week&apos;s Resume, is now taking place.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.51. Enemy bombing was on a very small scale. On the 27th March 29 people were killed by a direct hit on a canteen at Poole. On the 1st April 8 aircraft were destroyed on the ground at Warmwell aerodrome when 6 R.A.F. personnelwere killed, and on the 2nd April 7 aircraft were damaged on the ground atCatfoss aerodrome.Elsewhere the damage was confined to private property and no incidentcaused more than 2 fatal casualties.By Night.52. During three nights of the week no bombs were dropped and on two nights the few bombs which fell caused no important damage and no casualties.On the night of the 29th/30th March a short but heavy attack was made onAvonmouth and Bristol. On the night of the 31st March/1st April a short raid was made on Hull and surrounding district, and incidents occurred at Portsmouthand Swansea.Damage.Avonmouth and Bristol.53. In the attack on the night of the 29th/30th March a large number ofI.B.&apos;s fell in the dock area of Avonmouth and many fires were started. In theRoyal Edward Dock three oil cisterns belonging to the Anglo-American oil company were set on fire, and the barrelling and can-filling sheds of Shell-Mex&amp; B.P., Ltd., were gutted. No other important damage has been reported. InBristol some damage was done to private property.Elseivhere.54. Considerable damage was done to private property at Hull, but KeyPoints, including the docks, were only slightly affected. Only minor damage was caused by bombs which fell in Portsmouth Dockyard and Swansea Docks.Casualties.55. The estimated casualties for the week ending 0600 the 2nd April are104 killed and 151 seriously injured. These figures include 29 killed at Poole,38 at Hull and 11 in the raid on Avonmouth and Bristol.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.THE increase in Raid Assessment Material has now been found to be only temporary, and this Appendix is therefore resumed in view of its value in assessing the immediate results of our air offensive. This week the Appendix isof considerable length, as, for continuity, material received during the last fortnight is included.Germany.1. Emden. A photograph taken during the night attack on the 31st Marchshows fires burning fiercely on each side of the railway dock in the Alter BinnenHafen (which area contains the railway station, harbour and customs office and warehouses) and dense columns of smoke apparently originating from fireswhich had obtained a firm hold in the residential area bounded by the Rats andFaldern Delfts.2. Gelsenkirchen. Photographs taken on. the 12th March show that thegasometer, said to be the largest in Europe, previously reported damaged, hasnow been completely dismantled. Photographs taken during the raid on theHydrierwerke Scholven on the night of the 14th/15th March disclose : (i) Threefires burning in centre of target in the immediate vicinity of the reactionchambers, (ii) Smoke and gases escaping from working reaction chambers asa result of a direct hit on, or fractures to, high-pressure lines, (iii) Smokecoming from the sludge separator plant, a building near the south-east corner ofthe sludge recovery plant and from another building close by, and also from a medium-size gas holder.3. Hamburg. An informant who was present in the harbour in the second half of January reports that salvage work was proceeding on two ships that hadbeen sunk therein. Photographs taken on the 13th and 15th March have been rendered difficult to assess owing to haze covering some of the areas photographed,but the following damage is apparent: (a) Blohm and Voss. The foundry, 520 feet in length, has received a direct hit at the northern end and the remainder of the building and an adjoiningbuilding, 350 feet in length, have been damaged by fire. A direct hit is seen onthe southern end of the administrative offices, and it is thought the S.E. end ofthe graving dock and the sawmill have also been damaged.(b) Vulcan Shipyards. There is a direct hit on the workmen&apos;s dining roomsand damage to the general office building and the western end of the main frameand pla,te shops. Hits have been obtained on a large shop on the eastern sideof the works, and there is a large hole at the southern end of the roof of a shopalongside the slips near the carpenters&apos; and joiners&apos; shops.(c) Warehouses. A large warehouse on the Windhuk Quay, one on the NordCanal, one on the Sud Canal, and one on the S.E. side of the Saale Hafen have all suffered considerable damage. A 450-foot warehouse on the August VictoriaKai has been completely gutted.(d) Railways. The Berlinertor Station buildings are being repaired, thereis a direct hit on the line on the west side of the railway ferry over Kohlbrandand also on the main line north of a station believed to be Veddel.(e) Domestic Property. Considerable damage is disclosed, in particular, to three blocks of houses each about 200 feet in length, and to a block of flats 500 feetin length in the St. Pauli district, which have been wrecked or gutted.4. A reliable source states that the raid on the 13th/14th March causedheavy damage in the city, where public buildings, barracks and houses were firedand an explosive factory was hit. For a time the fires were out of control and casualties were heavy. A source (whose other information is reliable) states thatin the raid on the 12th/13th March submarines building on the slips in the navaldockyard were damaged.  Three submarines fitting out were saved by being towed
out of the basin. Another reliable report has been received of the damage to thenaval base and dockyard. There were casualties among the employees, and their fellow workmen were forbidden to tell of it. The incendiary bombs were particularly effective and the top floors of the Dresdner bank were burnt out.5. Kiel--Photographs taken during the attack on the night of the 18th/19th March disclosed fires in the immediate vicinity of the main Post and telegraph Office, and across the main railway line and sidings 800 yards southof the main station. At the Germania Werfte Shipbuilding Yards there werefires in the storage-es department and the coppersmithers&apos; shop and at the S.E..corner of the tracing-out shop and the southern corner of the turners&apos; shop.Photographs taken on the 28th March are difficult to interpret for damage assessment owing to heavy haze and clouds. The main features are :(i) The sawmill in Krupps shipbuilding yard is shown to be seriously damaged and has probably been completely gutted, (ii) Part of a store or warehouse atthe south end of this yard has been wrecked, (iii) A large area in Kehlen andHolstein Strassen has been completely gutted, (iv) A direct hit has been obtained on the tramway power house, (v) Craters are seen on the railway track to thesouth side of the Kummel Wiese Bridge, (vi) Buildings close to the main Postand Telegraph Office are burnt out. There is reason to believe from the photographs that hits were obtained on, and in the immediate vicinity of, Kruppsmain shops, but this cannot be confirmed with certainty.6. Berlin.- Excellent photographs taken on the 14th March show con-siderable damage and refute reports that the effect of our raids has been slight.It is true to say, however, that the damage is in no case heavily concentrated inone particular area, giving a picture of destruction such as was shown in the photographs of Hanover. The photographs confirm reports of damage obtainedfrom other sources sent out in previous summaries, and show clearly the hoardingserected around bombed parts of which many sources have spoken. Details covernine pages of the interpretation report and cannot adequately be summarised.Interesting features are : (a) The destruction of a considerable area ofproperty, both at the North and South end of the Graf Spee Strasse. (6) The:destruction of a block of buildings just to the West of the Stettiner Station.(c) Considerable demolition and excavation in progress of and to the Ministry of propaganda building, (d) The roof and upper floors of large buildings along the Wilhelmstrasse between the Reich Presidential Chancellory and the AirMinistry have been destroyed, (e) It is thought that damage has been caused tothe roofs of buildings in the War Ministry. (/) The bridge over the Spree at theEastern end of the Unter den Linden is closed to traffic. The North side of thebridge shows signs of damage, (g) The gallery of the Cathedral has been damaged and the roof is holed on the West Side, (h) Schlesischer station has suffered only slight damage, but the Wrienzener station nearby is severely damaged. The central portion, including the arched span, has been wrecked, anddemolition work has had to be carried out right down to the foundations. (?&apos;) TheN.E. corner of the Alexanderplatz has suffered severely.Three reports have already been received of the effectiveness of the raidon the 12th/13th March. This is well illustrated by a reliable report whichspeaks of new types of incendiary and high explosive bombs which have been dropped with great.effect. As in Hanover the efficiency of the incendiary bombswas particularly spoken of and they are now said to explode if water is thrown on them. Two of the reports tell of the destruction to water mains which impededthe efforts of the fire brigade and caused flooding in cellars. All reports statethat the population was depressed, one stating that Goering, under his nicknameof Herr Meyer, was openly abused, another that the majority of people were latefor work and irritable the next morning. The report states that Berlin&apos;s greatestweakness, bad shelters, was felt again, and the majority of those killed were incellars which collapsed. Five-storey houses in the Barbarossa Strasse were completely demolished or burnt out, and in one thirty people are said tohave been killed. It is said that most damage was in the Schoneberg area,where over 100 were killed and 300 injured. The raid was at its peak between0130 and 0330 hours, when the authorities stated that 80 aircraft were over thecentre of the City.Following upon the raid of the 12th/13th March (which is again saidto have been very successful) the following districts or parts thereof were closed[22392] o
to the public: Schoneberg, Steglitz, Alt Moabit. Lankwitz and Marienfelde.Whilst on previous occasions houses have been partially demolished, in this raidthe)r were totally destroyed.7. Bochum. Two military barracks occupied by A.A. personnel have been destroyed.8. Bremen. Further photographs taken on the 18th March show 53 hitsor craters on or near Focke-Wulf aircraft works and aerodrome. At the riceand starch mills warehouses have been damaged and part of the mill buildings have been gutted. A direct hit is shown on a warehouse storing cereals for theRoland mills and the jute spinning works have been damaged. Warehousesbetween Hafen &apos;; E &quot; and Flafen &quot; F &quot; have been considerably damaged. Thereare two direct hits on a bottleneck of railway lines in this neighbourhood.Considerable damage is disclosed to commercial and other buildings in the oldtown and part of the market square has been barricaded off.Excellent daylight photographs of Bremen taken on the 18th March revealextensive damage to dock and residential areas, and confirm points of probabledamage which it was not possible to detect in previous photographs. The main features shown are as follows :  (i) A tlas Works Shipbuilding Yards. The site of the two-bay building310 feet long previously destroyed has been cleared. Half of a shed 230 feetlong has been gutted and the roof of another shed has been destroyed, and theinterior appears to be wrecked. Houses and buildings in surrounding streetshave been severely damaged.(ii) Alstadt. Sheds and houses have been damaged by fire, and the end of along building on the Oster Hors Strasse (east of the market place) is destroyed.(iii) Theerhof. Damage to industrial buildings just east of Kaiser Bridgeis more extensive than was previously thought. Four bays on the north side are completely wrecked and two others on the south side are demolished and twoburned out.(iv) Neustadt. Considerably more damage than was previously reported isshown to houses and buildings in this area. Two sheds 280 feet long east of theNeustadt Station have been demolished.(y) Main Railway Station. Some damage is shown to railway sheds and buildings.(vi) Goods Station. Four warehouse bays over a total length of 200 feethave been completely gutted and a number of long sheds demolished, causingmuch surrounding damage. At the south-east corner of the yard three lengths ofsheds have been completely destroyed for over 250 feet northwards. The roof ofa large warehouse at the north end of the yard has been severely damaged with one bay completely destroyed at the west end.(vii) New Gas Works. A building close to the gas holders has had its roofpartially destroyed and is probably wrecked inside.9. Bremerhafen. Two reports have stated that the liner Europa has been damaged, one stating that she has received four hits. (Photographs show thisliner as lying in Kaiserhafen III.)10. Cologne. Two further reports have told of the severe damage to theKalk plant of Humboldt Deutz, the greater part of which was apparently effected in the raid on the 26th/27th February. A wholesale cigar and tobacco warehousein the Yenloer Strasse (believed to be that of F. Sommer) and the administrativeoffices of a factory at Kalk, making agricultural machinery, were burnt out. Inthe suburb of Bayenthal, a factory, a cinema and a small petrol depot were destroyed.Photographs taken on the 12th March confirm that the Humboldt Deutzfactory is only partly active and show destruction to buildings therein.I.G. Forben of Leverkusen shows very little activity for so large a plant. Themain shed in the Bonntor Marshalling Yard, which is about 350 feet long, hasbeen completely gutted and a group of six sheds between the railway and theBonner Wall are also thought to have been destroyed. Domestic property on thewest side of Drachenfels Strasse has been damaged by fire.A reliable source reports that in the raid of the 3rd/4th March, over400 houses were destroyed and 100 fires started, one of which, in a factory, burntfor three days.   Two reports which show the damage done to the Bonntor Goods
Yard have been received. The first states that a Swiss firm had received notifica-tion of a consignment of goods for them having been destroyed in this yard, andthe second states that, owing to the partial destruction of the yard, wagons of a firm accustomed to use the same would, in the future, be located in the GereonGoods Yard. A reliable source reports that the Humboldt Deutz Works have been heavily damaged in recent raids. It is said that the works will not be able to resume full production for three weeks and possibly longer.II. Dusseldorf. Photographs taken during the night of the 14th/15thMarch disclose four large fires extending from (i) South-east corner ofHolzhafen to west of Handelshafen. (ii) A large fire believed to be in a grainstore building on the quay on west side of the Smaller Holzhafen. (iii) About15 smaller fires in the railway goods yards and siding on the south side ofthe docks, (iv) Three burst on the very large Plange wheat mill, one of whichwould appear to be a direct hit on the silos. The research department of KlocknorHumboldt Deutz (iron foundry, machine factory and enamelling works) havebeen destroyed and several other buildings in the works damaged.Photographs taken on the 16th March are difficult to assess. The photo-graphs show a direct hit at the south end of the central station and one bay and a covered platform at the north end destroyed. The Burghof Strasserailway station has also received a direct hit. Rheinmetall Borsig (armamentmanufacturers) have been hit and one large building in the works completelygutted. The print of the dock area shows more damage on one individual printthan has up to the present been seen. A large area has been completely guttedand another even larger area has been burnt out in varying degrees. Fivelarge buildings and other smaller buildings in this last-mentioned area havebeen completely burnt out and stocks of timber destroyed. There are severalcraters in the railway yards adjoining the docks and trucks are seen burnt out.There is no visible rail activity due, it is believed, to the lines being out of order.A grain elevator storage has received a direct hit and a corner of the Plangewheat mills has been ba,dly damaged. The interpretation of the report describesthis area as an excellent example of &quot; blitzing.&quot;12. General. An interesting example of German clearance of damage hasbeen supplied by a well-placed source, who tells of the destruction of a building at Siemens Works in Berlin containing stores of iron oasts. Within four days the site of the building had been cleared and covered with turf. After thisjournalists were permitted to visit the works to see that no damage had been done.Impartial eye-witnesses tell of the serious effects of recent raids on Hamburgand Cologne. They also tell of considerable damage in Berlin. Some of thepopulation of Berlin panicked when the recent raid took place due to the popular belief that we have found a bomb which, though small, has great pene-trative and destructive power. (Note, The explanation of the belief in a smallbomb is due to the strength of German propaganda, which has impressed uponBerliners that, to reach Berlin, only a light bomb can be carried.) The nightexpress from the Hague to Berlin is reported to have received a direct hit while in motion during the first week of March.   Casualties were heavy.France.13. Boulogne. In a recent attack considerable difficulties were caused tothe German Authorities by a direct hit on a store containing gas bombs.14. Vannes. A reliable source reports that on the 4th/5th February, onewing of the barracks of the 505th Regiment was destroyed. The same sourcealso reports that in a raid on the aerodrome on the 12th/ 13th February, a largehangar and two aircraft were destroyed. Six hits were obtained on two railwaysand the meteorological station was put out of action.15. Brest. In the raid on the 25th February, the gasworks was severely damaged.   (Photographs taken since this date confirm this report.)16. Asfeld. An attack on the aerodrome on the night of the 25th Februaryresulted in a German order for 150 coffins from the town of Reims nearby.17. Havre. The transformer station of the Compagnie Electromecaniquehas been destroyed.
Holland.18. A reliable source reports that a large German tanker attacked offRotterdam on the 6th January sank shortly after.Rotterdam. Photographs taken on the 19th March show the success of the attack upon the oil refinery and oil storage tanks in the petrol harbour. Threetanks have been destroyed, nine badly damaged, and three more probably damaged. The tanks are estimated to have had a capacity of 4,000 tons; while on previous occasions the refinery has shown activity, the present photographs show it to be inactive.Mining.19. The Finnish Wireless announces that the Finnish steamer Virma-of 1,500 tons has been sunk. The position was not stated but as the crew were saved and taken to Cuxhaven it is presumed that the sinking took place inthe area off the mouth of the Elbe. In the third week of February a German ship was mined off Lorient; the ship is said to have up to 1,800 men on board andmanj- corpses were washed ashore on the Quiberon Peninsula. The 6,000-ton merchant ship which left Havre on the 22nd February sank off the port, it isbelieved as a result of striking a mine. The wrecks of 2 steamers have been observed off the mouth of the River Ems. One is a vessel of about 1,500 tons.A reliable informant reports that on or about the 14th March a German sub-marine struck a mine and sank in the Marsdiep Channel between Den Helderand the Island of Texel.
