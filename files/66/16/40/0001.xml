The reports of operations in and around Crete are given on page 5.NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.The Mediterranean Fleet continues to be engaged in the Cretan operations.The German battleship Bismarck has been sunk in the Atlantic.Shipping losses have been light.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2. Following reports received from air reconnaissance, the German battle-ship Bismarck and cruiser Prinz Eugen were sighted by H.M. Ships Norfolk andSuffolk late on the 23rd May in -the Denmark Strait. They were shadoweduntil early on the 24th, when they were engaged by H.M. Ships Hood andPrince of Wales. H.M.S. Hood was hit and blew up, and the chase continued throughout the 24th. Torpedo aircraft from H.M.S. Victorious obtained one hiton Bismarck at 1220, but touch was then lost until 1030 on the 26th, when shewas again sighted by a Catalina aircraft, and later by H.M.S. Sheffield.Successful torpedo attacks were made by torpedo-aircraft from H.M.S. Ark Royalthe same day and by H.M. Destroyers Cossack, Maori, Zulu and Sikh duringthe night. Bismarck was engaged by H.M. Ships King George V (Flag of commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet), Rodney and Norfolk early on the 27th, and finally sunk at 1100 by torpedoes from H.M.S. Dorsetshire about 400 miles.S.W. of Land&apos;s End; some hundred survivors were picked up. Some damage and casualties were suffered in H.M. Ships Prince of Wales, Cossack and Zidu.While returning from the action our ships were attacked off the west coast ofIreland, and H.M. Destroyer Mashona was hit and later abandoned. No reportof the movements of Prinz Eugen has been received since the evening of the 24th,in spite of a search by 64 aircraft from Bomber Command.3. H.M.S. Edinburgh intercepted the German s.s. Lech (3,290 tons)400 miles north of the azores on the 22nd. The ship scuttled herself by explosivecharges.H.M. Trawler Cape Portland intercepted the Finnish s.s. Dagmar(2,149 tons) 190 miles west of the Faroes and escorted her in.The Dutch Cruiser Van Kinsbergen intercepted the French s.s. Winnipegeast of Martinique on the 26th, and is taking her into Trinidad.H.M.S. Registan (Ocean Boarding Vessel) was bombed and set on fire offLand&apos;s End on the 27th.   She is being towed into port.The Dutch minelayer Nautilus sank off the Humber on the 22nd, as the resultof a collision.Four ex-U.S. coastguard-cutters have arrived in Great Britain.During the period 6 French merchant ships (22,000 tons) have passed gibraltar westbound, and 6 (upwards of 15,000 tons) eastbound. All were underescort.Mediterranean.(Note. Operations in vicinity of  Crete have been  dealt with under&quot; Military Situation.&quot;)4. H.M. Submarine Upholder obtained a hit on a 4,000-ton laden tanker inthe southern entrance to the Straits of Messina on the 20th, and torpedoed a5,000-ton ship in the same vicinity on the 23rd. On the 24th she sighted threelarge liners escorted by destroyers, 30 miles south-east of Augusta; she hitwith two torpedoes on one large ship which is thought to have sunk.H.M. Sloop Grimsby and the tanker she was escorting were sunk by air attack 40 miles north-east of Tobruk on the 25th. .H.M. Submarine Usk is overdue and must be considered lost.
Anti-Submarine Operations.5. Only two attacks on U-boats have been carried out during the week; one by an aircraft off La^ Roehelle and another by gunfire from. ELM. SubmarinePandora to the westward of Oporto, both without visible result. &apos;Enemy Intelligence.German.6. The battleship Tirpitz together with the Pocket-Battleship admiral scheer and the Cruiser Hipper were photographed at Kiel on the 2.8th May.Scharnhorst and Gneisenau remain at Brest, but the former was observed at 1930on the 25th May to have moved one ship&apos;s length to the eastward. unfortunately the quality of the photographs and cloud prevent it being definitely known whethera boom is in position round her or whether her camouflage has been removed.The Pocket-Battleship Lutzow, together with four destroyers and four torpedo boats, may have been at Swinemunde on the 12th May.Italian.7. No changes in the dispositions of Italian Naval forces have been received.Repairs to the battleship Liitorio were completed the 7th May and the Vittoriofeneto is probably now in the dry dock at Taranto.V-boats.8. The average number of enemy submarines which have been operating inthe North-Western Approaches during the past week has been about eighteen ornineteen, of which only three or four were Italian. No concerted attack has beenmade since the 20th May by German submarines and they have not been much inevidence, sightings having been very rare. Their dispositions were probablygreatly affected by the adventures of the Bismarck and it is safe to presume thatthey were moved considerable distances in an attempt to provide assistance. Thepresent situation is accordingly obscure. Four German submarines have been operating in the Freetown area.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.9.   Shipping losses during the period have been exceptionally light.Aircraft have unsuccessfully attacked an English Channel convoy and haveinflicted some casualties on a Bristol Channel convoy and shipping off milford haven and off Sunderland.k &apos;Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending the 28th May, 948 ships, of which 155 wereAllied and 15 Neutral, were convoyed. One battleship, two cruisers, eleven armed merchant cruisers, four submarines, 55 destroyers and 68 sloops and corvetteshave been employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the24th May totalled 664,736 tons, compared with 1,062,626 tons during the previousweek and an average of 575,940 tons for the past ten weeks. Oil imports in14 tankers, amounted to 133,559 tons, compared with 306,636 tons in 28 tankersduring the week ending the 17th May. Mineral imports were 223,492 tons, ofwhich 154,453 tons were steel, pig iron, scrap iron and iron ore. Timber imports were 39,443 tons, and cereal imports 149,305 tons, 19 ships being fully laden withgrain. Other food imports were 56,686 tons, of which 20,188 tons were sugar,5,319 tons were fresh, dried and tinned fruit (including a shipload of 1,139 tonsof oranges), 4,000 tons were cocoa, 4,745 tons were meat and 964 tons were tea.There were 200 tons of rum from Demerara and 334 tons of tobacco. TheSvend Foyn, 14,795 tons, brought 103,859 barrels of whale oil from South Georgia.There were the usual imports of machinery, aircraft, ammunition and war stores.[22565] b 2
British Minelaying.11. On the 21st May EMS. Rorqual laid 50 mines in the Gulf of Salonika,and on the same day H.M.S. Abdiel laid 154 mines off Cape Dakato on the westcoast of Greece.On the 22nd May, and again on the 27th, H.M.S. Teviot Bank laid 270 mines in the East Coast Barrier.Minelaying has been carried out by aircraft off the Channel and Bay of biscay ports throughout the week.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.12. Minelaying by enemy aircraft round the British Isles has been on a considerably reduced scale and there has been only one ship damaged by mineduring the week. Ten magnetic mines have been dealt with in Home Waters andseventeen acoustic. No contact mines have been swept. Including a few belatedreports and mines dealt with in Foreign Waters, the totals now are: magnetic1,166 (of which LL sweeps have accounted for 941), acoustic 627 and contact 872.Suez Canal.Traffic was resumed on the 22nd May, but the Canal was raided by about aircraft on the 24th, and the northern section was closed to navigation. traffic was again resumed on the 27th May, ships being swept through the dangerousarea. Five mines have been dealt with in the Canal during the week.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.13. It is reported that all German and Italian ships in refuge in Japan areto be given covering Japanese nationality and used locally. The Salzburg,1,756 tons, passed Istanbul on the 21st May for the ^aegean half-loaded. Thisis the last of the eight German ships which have been trading in the Black Sea,all of them being now in the ^aegean. There are, however, eighteen Roumanianmerchant ships, totalling some 70,000 tens, in the Black Sea. The HungarianKassa, 1,022 tons, has been reported to be making for the ^aegean from the black sea with five German officers on board and a cargo of searchlights, A/A guns,machine guns and grenades. The Hungarian Tisza, 961 tons, is said to be loadinga similar cargo at Constanza and was expected to pass Istanbul for the iEgeanon the 28th May.The Monserrate, 5,578 tons, which was set on fire by her crew at Callao atthe beginning of April and was gutted, has now been brought into dock.On the 22nd May, the Windhuk, 16,662 tons, which is at Santos, Brazil,received 250 drums of oil fuel and the next day she was taking water on board.Customs officials are said to have received permission from Rio de Janeiro togrant her a clearance permit if she asks for it. At Rio de Janeiro the Hermes(ex-Karnak), 7,209 tons, is loading rapidly and is reported to be likely to sail atthe end of the month.The tanker Germania, 9,851 tons, with 13,000 tons of petrol on board, leftLas Palmas at 0300/27 and arrived at Teneriffe at 0900/27. The Madrid,8,777 tons, which left Las Palmas on the 11th December last, is reported to havearrived.in a German-occupied port.Italian.14. The tanker Gianna M, 5,719 tons, which was intercepted after sailing from the Canary Islands by H.M.S. Hilary, arrived at Belfast in prize on the20th May.The Zeffiro, 5,165 tons, was reported on the 20th May to have been sunk nearCap Bon probably by a mine. Of the five Italian merchant ships and threetankers which were, until recently, in the Black Sea, three ships, including onetanker, have gone through the Bosphorus to the iEgean.The tankers Todaro, 5,162 tons, and Arcola, 6,349 tons, at Teneriffe, were reported early in the week ,to be loading, and the Todaro sailed at 0200/27.
MILITARY SITUATION.Crete.15. Fighting in Crete has continued with intensity throughout the week.Once detected our positions have been relentlessly and continuously bombed by day. In spite of heavy losses, the enemy has succeeded in reinforcing and in maintaining his concentrations by air. No major seaborne landings have beenreported. Various enemy convoys tried to reach the Island but were driven off by ELM. Ships, several caiques full of German soldiers being sunk.Maleme was bombarded by H.M. Ships on the 21st May and again onthe 23rd May. Enemy dive-bombers made repeated attacks on H.M. Ships,causing severe casualties, as set out below. In the Retimo and Heraklionareas our troops have succeeded in denying the aerodromes to the enemy, but inthe Suda area the enemy, having captured Maleme Aerodrome and the area west of it, launched successive air and ground attacks on our positions covering Caneaand Suda and eventually on the 28th May compelled our troops to fall back to theeast of Suda Bay. H.M.S. Abdiel (Minelayer) and H.M. Destroyers Hero andNizam successfully transported troops and stores to Suda Bay during the night of the 26th/27th and returned with 700 personnel.16. During the week the Royal Air Force, operating from Egyptian bases,assisted the defence by making repeated daylight attacks on Maleme Aerodromeand enemy landing grounds. At least thirty-eight enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground and many others damaged. In addition, our fighters shot down at least eleven enemy aircraft, including five loaded troop-carriers. . The capacityof these troop-carrying aircraft is estimated at 10 men with equipment. Gliderswere also used, and on the 23rd May one Ju.52 is reported to have been observedtowing six gliders. Wellingtons operating at night dropped stores and medicalsupplies in the Heraklion and Retimo areas, and attacked Maleme on fouroccasions, causing fires on the aerodrome and beaches. Our losses during theweek were six Wellingtons, eleven Blenheims and nine Hurricanes.17. The total scale of the German effort to date is difficult to estimateaccurately, but it is thought that at least 14,000 troops were landed&apos; by air andby parachute in the Maleme area alone, together with mortars, infantry guns,field guns and motor cycles. The effort in the Retimo and Heraklion areas wasvery much less, and it is probable that the Germans, carrying out their usualpolicy of reinforcing success, diverted troops from these two objectives in orderto throw them into the fight at Maleme and Canea.18. The King of the Hellenes and suite were taken off from the western endof Crete on the night of the 22nd May by H.M. Destroyers Hero and Decoy.Naval Casualties.19. During the above operations the following casualties were inflicted by enemy aircraft on H.M. Ships of the Mediterranean Fleet due to insufficientaircraft cover so close to enemy air bases and to the dearth of anti-aircraftammunition : Sunk. Cruisers, Gloucester and Fiji; Destroyers, Greyhound, Kellyand Kashmir.Damaged. Battleships, War spite, Valiant and Bgrham; Aircraft-Carrier Formidable; Cruisers Naiad, Perth, A jaw and Dido; and DestroyersNubian and Hereward. Cruiser York, damaged repeatedly in Suda Bay, isnow considered a total loss.Egypt and Libya.20. Since the 19th May there have been severe sand storms in the western desert and operations have been chiefly confined to patrol activity in the Tobrukarea and in the vicinity of Sollum and the Egyptian frontier. The enemy seemsto be concentrating upon strengthening his defensive positions facing Tobruk.His aircraft have carried out numerous bombing and machine-gun attacks,but the damage done has been slight.
21. On the evening of the 25th May four enemy armoured cars and one aircraft attacked the Egyptian frontier post at Bir Shegga, driving in theEgyptian Frontier Force patrol and occupying their position. There has been nofurther advance and the patrol is still in touch.22. On the afternoon of the 26th May enemy forces, including tanks and supported by artillery, attacked our troops in the Halfaya district,-and.we. were obliged to withdraw. Two counter-attacks were unsuccessful, and 5 Infantrytanks were reported out of action. South of the escarpment two enemy columnsof all arms engaged our forces, which were forced back, and are now coveringBir Habata, 50 miles south-east of Halfaya. Latest reports state that the enemyforce is halted in an area some. 30 miles from Bir Habata.23. It is hard to assess the possible scope of these enemy operations, for maintenance problems are still believed to be serious in Cyrenaica. Suppliesappear, however, to be reaching Benghazi by sea, for a reconnaissance On the23rd May revealed three ships of about 10,000, 5,000 and 1,000 tons respectivelyin the harbour, which a day or two earlier had been empty. As far as can be judged from air reconnaissance, airborne supplies and reinforcements have been on a small scale, and this may be due either to the heavy demands on aircraft inthe operations in Crete, or possibly to insufficient fuel in Libya to provide forthe return journey. It is possible that enemy pressure in Cyrenaica may havebeen applied in order to coincide with the operations in Crete.Abyssinia.24. With the surrender of the Duke of Aosta and the Amba Alagi garrisonon the 19th and 20th May the main centres of enemy resistance remaining wereGondar, Gimma and the Lakes lying to the south of Addis Ababa. The last ofthese three has largely been disposed of during the week, which has seen thejunction of our troops operating southwards from Adama with those coming-northwards from Neghelli and Yavello. These operations resulted in the capture of several thousand enemy with much equipment. Heavy rains are makingconditions very difficult, but operations continue.25. In the north-west the attack on Chelga, covering the western road intoGondar, is being pushed home, and we have captured a strategic position on theChelga Eidge.26. The large force which escaped from Debra Marcos and which has since been leading an uncomfortable existence in the mountainous districts of centralAbyssinia to the north of Addis Ababa, surrendered at Agibar on the 23rd May,with quantities of equipment.27. Work is proceeding on clearing up demolitions and repairing thedamaged bridge on the Soddu-Gimma road, while our troops continue to roundup the enemy in Lake Margharita district.28. Mopping-up continues in the north-eastern corner of Italian Somaliland,where practically no resistance is being experienced.Iraq.Basra, i29. Ashar and Basra remain quiet. The newly formed administrativecouncil has issued a declaration asking for public support.30. On the 21st/22nd May the enemy made an attempt, frustrated by our patrols, to breach the bunds protecting Ashar and Shuaiba aerodrome. an operation on the 25th May by one battalion with Royal Navy and Royal Air Forceco-operation against enemy troops 6 miles up the Tigris from Basra was successful.Habbaniya.31. The Regent and his party are in Habbaniya, which has been raided by german aircraft on several occasions.
423432. The advance of our troops towards Bagdad was delayed by the enemybreaching the bund of the Euphrates, but Khan Nuqta, 20 miles from Bagdad,was reached on the 28th May.33. Many German &quot;tourists&quot; are reported to have passed through Iranto Iraq and war materials are said to have been sent through Turkey, but the most recent report says that Germany has declared she can give the Iraqis no more helpat present. There is little doubt that the latter are disappointed with the amountof help given so far.34. The Germans in Bagdad are reported to be leaving for Mosul, wherethey are building up an air base.Intelligence.Invasion of the United Kingdom.35. The movement of shipping, carrying troops and stores from GermanBaltic ports northwards up the Norwegian coast, continues, and it must there-fore be concluded that the German forces in Northern Norway are still being-reinforced. One unconfirmed report states that the German authorities are alsostudying billeting facilities in South Norway. &apos;36. A combined operations exercise on a considerable scale was recentlycarried out on the Island of Rugen. This confirms previous reports that the island is one of the main centres for &quot; invasion practice.&quot; The building of small craft with special landing contrivances is reported from the Rhine and Ruhrareas, where embarkation practices have also been taking place.37. Further reports have been received of &apos;&apos; special training &apos;&apos; involving the use of British uniforms and the study of British methods.38. While these reports show that long-term invasion preparations con-tinue without cessation, there is little likelihood of any attempt being made until some of Germany&apos;s present commitments elsewhere have been liquidated.Spain and Portugal.39. There is a report that the Vichy authorities gave the Germans certainsupervisory rights over movements of troops and war material by sea or air along the Mediterranean coast of France from Marseilles to the Pyrenees as from theend of April. This would seem.to indicate that such movements are contem-plated, though their exact object is at present obscure. It is also reported that several German commissions have been studying roads and billeting and supplyfacilities in Spain. * Italian troops are said to be standing by to take over theBordeaux area when the Germans advance southwards.40. On the other hand, there are several suggestions that the germans will take no action against Spain until July; and there are grounds for believing that Hitler wishes to be certain of Spanish consent before entering Spain.Bulgaria.41. On the 19th May the Danube was reported open to transport betweenBulgaria and Budapest. The Bulgarian Government reports that the Danube is open to freight boats from Bulgaria to the Black Sea. It is likely, however, that considerable congestion at the Danube ports still makes traffic in either directiondifficult. The Bulgarian road and railway services are being hampered by thenorthward movement of German troops and materials.Yugoslavia.    - .42. Considerable progress has been made in the reconstruction of railways in Yugoslavia, but neither the Belgrade-Pancevo (King Peter) Bridge.overthe Danube nor the railway bridge at Belgrade over the Save seems to have beenrepaired. Through railway traffic between northern and southern Yugoslaviais hence probably still impeded. ,
French North A frica.43. There are said to be at least 300 German &apos;&apos; tourists &apos;&apos; in French north africa, and one report states that there has been an increase during May in themovement of Germans of military age through Spain to Spanish Morocco and thence to the French Zone, and another that German A.A. officers are staying inMogador and have visited Agadir and Ifni.Syria.44. The Vichy French are reported to have evacuated the Aleppo district and to have handed over the nearby Merab aerodrome to the Germans. Someunits of the French garrison have been moved southwards and there seems to be something of a concentration near the southern frontier and in the neighbourhoodof Suneida and Kuneitra.India.45. The situation in North Waziristan is still unsatisfactory. A largegang about 1,300 strong, reported between Razmak and Datta Khel, is said to bepreparing an attack. Air reconnaissance has not, however, observed any abnormalmovement.AIR SITUATION.General Review.46. Operations by Bomber Command were restricted by unsuitable weather conditions, and enemy activity against this country was also on a reduced scale.Many effective attacks were made on enemy shipping both in Home Waters andin the Central Mediterranean.Bombers and Fighters from Egypt have supported our operations in Crete.&apos; Operational aircraft battle casualties and extracts from recent RaidAssessment Reports are given in Appendices VI and VII.Germany and Occupied TerritoryGeneral.47. Daylight operations by Bomber Command showed an increase over thoseof the previous week, 191 sorties being flown. Night operations, consisting of148 sorties, showed a decrease, which was attributable to the unfavourable weather.Day.48. On the 27th May Blenheims of Bomber Command made a surprise attackon Lannion Aerodrome near Brest, and registered direct hits on two hangars, oneof which was demolished. Seven Me. 109&apos;s were certainly hit and it is possiblethat others were damaged. Two large explosions occurred and the whole area was covered by a pall of srnoke. The reason for this attack was that it had been previously reported that forty to fifty long range bombers had moved to Lannionearly that morning, possibly to support German naval operations.&quot;^&quot;T^^T^C^ffehsive fighter sweeps, one of which comprised five squadrons, were carried out each day over North-East France. During these operations wedestroyed, without loss to ourselves, two enemy aircraft and probably three more.50. The remainder of our effort was entirely directed against shipping andis reported under Coastal Operations.Night. i51. The weather was again unfavourable for our night bombers. Projectedoperations were cancelled on four nights and considerably curtailed during therest of the week.
52. Cologne was attacked on two nights, during which 105 tons of high explosive bombs and 16,000 incendiary bombs were dropped. On the first occasionresults in the main were unobserved. On the second occasion, many bursts were seen in the target area, and a particularly large fire was started near the Deutzrailway station. Other attacks were carried out against Boulogne, St. Nazaireand an aerodrome near Caen. Bombers were despatched on two nights to attackKiel, but on both occasions bad weather prevented accurate attacks. From allthese operations one aircraft is missing.United Kingdom.53. Fighter Command flew 1,038 patrols involving 2,511 sorties by day, and180 patrols involving 334 sorties by night, a reduction in the scale of effort ascompared with last week. German Air Force operations have also been on alighter scale both by day and night. About 250 long-range bombers operatedat night, but only a negligible proportion of them was directed against landtargets.54. By day, enemy sea and weather reconnaissances were normal, except on the 27th and 28th, when up to 50 long-range bombers from the Brest Peninsulaoperated over the Atlantic. On the 28th, offensive reconnaissances were flownover Kent by a total of about 50 aircraft, but on other days enemy fighter activity was limited to defensive patrols over the Straits and French coast. The routinereconnaissance flights were made overland by single aircraft55. During daylight five enemy aircraft, including two bombers, were destroyed during the week by our fighters operating over this country. Nointerceptions have been reported by our night fighters.Coastal Operations.56. Coastal Command flew 221 patrols and provided escorts for 82 convoys,involving a total of 673 sorties. Shipping protection patrols carried out by fighter Command totalled 605 and involved 1,268 sorties.57. Daily searches for coastal shipping were carried out off enemy occupied territory and a number of ships were bombed. Bomber Command claimed direct hits on seven merchant vessels, totalling about 28,000 tons; on an 800-ton trawlerand a 50-ton motor boat. Six Blenheims were lost in the course of these operations.. Coastal Command reported successful attacks on an 8,000-tonAltmark-class tanker, an 8,000-ton merchant vessel and two l,o00-ton coastalsteamers. *58. Air operations in connection with the Bismarck and Prinz Eugen areincluded in the Naval section headed &quot; Home Waters and North Atlantic.&quot;59. One hundred and fifty minelaying sorties were flown by bomber command and twenty-six by Coastal Command. Enemy minelayers were activeon two nights of the week, twenty aircraft being employed.60. German bomber reconnaissance aircraft operated from Norway towardsIceland (C) and East Scotland, and from France over coastal areas of Englandfrom the north-east to the Irish Sea. Anti-shipping raids, though not numerous,formed the greater part of the enemy&apos;s effort at night, and shipping attaeks were also made in daylight and at dusk. Aircraft of the Condor unit carried out-attacks on naval units and merchant shipping during the period under review.61. On the 27th May, the date on which the German battleship Bismarckwas sunk, fifty long-range bombers from the Brest area operated over the atlantic in search of our naval forces. The following day about forty aircraft attacked naval units, one of the attackers being shot down by our escortingaircraft and others driven off after jettisoning their bombs.[22565] c
Mediterranean and Malta.62. Successful attacks have been made on enemy shipping between sicily and the African coast, with the following results: 3,000-ton ship 4 direct hits.   On fire and apparently abandoned.4/5,000-ton ship, escorted by a destroyer two direct hits.8/10,000-ton ship, in convoy, loaded with M.T. five direct hits.8/10,000-ton ship, in the same convoy, left down by the stern after twodirect hits.63. Two Blenheims, after failing to locate a damaged Italian M.V. off SfaxHarbour, attacked a similar M.V. (4/5,000 tons) in the Harbour. Eight direct hits were obtained, resulting in a tremendous explosion and a large column of black smoke, from which it was evident that the ship was loaded withammunition. No flag or markings were observed on the ship attacked, but our aircraft were fired on by an Italian destroyer and M.Vs. in Sfax Road.64. In addition to the reconnaissance flights which led to the location ofthese ships, the Sicilian and Eastern Tunisian coasts have been constantlypatrolled. Mines were laid during one night off the island of Lampedusa, nearMalta.65. Enemy activity against Malta was on a less intensive scale. Smallformations of fighters operated near the Island, possibly in order to screentransport aircraft in.transit1 from Sicily to Benghazi, and one machine-gun attack was made on Takali Aerodrome, during which two Hurricanes were destroyed.An ineffective night attack was made by nine Italian aircraft, of which only twosucceeded in locating the Island and dropping their bombs.Egypt and Libya.66. Day operations by our aircraft over Libya have not been heavy.Persistent night attacks were made by Wellingtons on Benghazi. Hits were madeon the Cathedral Mole and telephone exchange, and fires were started in railwaysidings and near the wireless station. The enemy attacked Tobruk on several occasions with dive-bombers, two of which were shot down. On the night of the23rd/24th May enemy aircraft dropped 14 mines and 9 bombs in the suez canal area.Iraq and Syria.67. Operations have continued against enemy positions and aerodromes inIraq and against German aircraft on Syrian aerodromes.68. A petrol dump near Baghdad, believed to contain a million gallons,was completely demolished, and three enemy aircraft and a number of buildings were destroyed at Baquba and at Mosul. On the 24th May bombing operations were commenced against the enemy in the Ramadi area, where leaflets were alsodropped. Standing patrols were maintained over the Baghdad area and messageswere dropped on the Embassy.69. In Syria dispersed German aircraft at Palmyra aerodrome were attacked by two Blenheims, and during attacks on Aleppo, hangars and at least one enemy aircraft were destroyed. Leaflets were dropped over Damascus andSyrian frontier posts.70. The Iraqi Air Force was little in evidence, and though Habbaniya was attacked three times by German aircraft, no serious damage or casualties resulted.One of our reconnaissance aircraft was forced to land by three Italian fighters,one of which was shot down by Gladiators.Abyssinia.71. Aircraft of the South African Air Force and Blenheims of the free french Air Force have supported land operations in the Gimma and Gondarareas. An attack on enemy positions near Soddu by thirteen aircraft on the24th May resulted in direct hits on a ferry, camps and motor transport.
General Air Intelligence.Iraq.72. It is estimated that there are in Iraq about 40 German aircraft, mostlybased on Mosul. They are reported to be ill-supplied and the Germans have informed Rashid Ali that they cannot produce any appreciably greater air assist-ance under two months.Syria.73. The French Air Force are reported to have vacated Aleppo, and it isprobable that this aerodrome and Palmyra have both been taken over by the Axisfor their own exclusive use.Reinforcements for the French Air Force are expected to arrive in thecountry in the near future to increase French resistance against Britishintervention.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.74.   Only light bombing was experienced throughout the week.By Day.75. On the 24th May, houses were damaged at Yarmouth and Eastbourne,and an oil tank was hit at Lowestoft. On the 26th May, Lowestoft was attackedagain and 10 people killed. On the 27th May, there was a single attack onMontrose, causing a few casualties.By Night.76. On the 23rd/24th May, aerodromes were ineffectively bombed inOxfordshire and Sussex, and bombs were dropped at Peterborough and Brixham;on the 24th/25th May and the 25th/26th May, bombing was very light; on the26th/27th bombing was rather more widespread in Hampshire, Surrey and Kent;on the 27th/28th in a slightly wider area from Cornwall to Essex, and on the28th/29th in S.E.

Photographs taken on the 21st May covered five major attacks made sincethe city was last reported on on the 30th April. Unfortunately, only part ofthe city is covered, and some of the important dock areas have not beenphotographed. It is estimated that little more than half the town and dock area is, included.Ten days elapsed since the last heavy attack before it was possible tophotograph; consequently, it is to be expected that some of the damage will havebeen repaired. On the other hand, areas where buildings have been demolishedafter being damaged show up more clearly. A brief summary of the damage isas follows : (a) Large industrial buildings and dockside warehouses com-pletely gutted by fire or otherwise destroyed, or seriously damaged ...      ...      .\.      ...      ...      ...      ...      36Similar buildings less seriously damaged ...       ...       ...      20Minor damage, including roof repairs, and items listed as&apos;&apos; probable,&apos;&apos; but not including &apos;&apos; possible &apos;&apos; items   ...        9(b) Sites completely cleared, whether damage has been previously reported or not ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      ...       ...        8(c) Other buildings, the description of which is not known forcertain Completely gutted by fire,  or otherwise  destroyed or seriously damaged        ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      21Less seriously damaged        ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      14Minor damage ...       ...       ...      ...       ...       ...       ...        3(d) Other buildings (probably dwelling-houses, blocks of dwelling -. houses, or flats) Completely gutted by fire,  or otherwise destroyed or seriously damaged ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       19Less seriously damaged, including minor damage, androof repairs        ...      ...      ...       ...       ...       ...      26(e) Miscellaneous items Hits on railways        ...       ...      ...       ...       ...       ...        1Hits on railways (probable) ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        1Barrack buildings gutted     ......       ...       ...       ...        1Barrack buildings (roof damage)   ...       ...      ...       ...        1Hospital buildings damaged ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        1Merchant vessel probable hit        ...       ...      ...       ...        1In addition there are the following two items of major damage which are considered to be the direct result of the 4,000-lb. bombs dropped in the areacovered by the photographs :  (1) East of Steinwerder Canal an area which, entirely consisted of industrial buildings 450 x 380 ft. has been completely demolished and only partsof a few walls remain. The further effects of blast which caused thisdestruction can be seen within an area which measures 900 x 750 ft.The blast is clearly seen on the coal dump along the Reiherstieg and buildings alongside the railway line. The distance between the two points being 1,107 ft.(2) A warehouse on the Sudwest Hafen measuring approximately360x220 ft. completely destroyed The end of a smaller warehousebehind has been blown in or drawn out by blast, which would indicatethat the destruction of the first warehouse was probably the result ofa 4,000-lb. bomb. A warehouse adjoining has had one bay almostentirely wrecked and its remaining two bays severely damaged.Berlin. In the raid on the 9th/ 10th April the Lufthansa Offices in theEriedrichstrasse were fired. It is reported that, owing to R.A.F. raids on thecapital, the Diplomatic Corps are becoming increasingly anxious and there is talk of an impending move to Dresden.Kiel. Recent raids have been described in Berlin as most effective, andU-boat construction has been greatly hampered. The Germania works are nowconcentrating their attention to increasing their production at Gdynia on accountof the severe damage they have suffered at Kiel.
Mannheim. Photographs taken on the 17th May show the success, of the attacks on the 29th/30th April and the 5th/6th, 9th./10th and 12th/13th May;the damage is widespread and extensive and the principal features are: (i) The destruction of the Autobahn Bridge over the Rhine. The East parthas been completely destroyed and fallen into the river. Another partis out of alignment.(No specific claim to have attacked this bridge has been received,but on the night of the 5th/6th a Wellington dropped a 4,000-lb. bombon what was thought to be a junction in the Autobahn. A blue lightwas seen. The blue light may well have been caused by the disturbanceof the water consequent upon the collapse of the&apos; bridge and thedestruction of possible electric cables thereon.)(ii) The destruction of an area in the dock district comprising warehousesand sheds on each side of the &quot;Verbindungs-Kanal covering a combinedspace of about 4-J acres.(iii) Heavy damage to domestic property in another part of the dock districtcovering approximately 200 by 130 yards (believed to have been causedby one large bomb).(iv) Considerable destruction of property in the Schwetzinger Strasse, oneof the main streets in the new town,(v) A triangular block of buildings about 160 by 140 by 120 yards to theWest of the Rhine Bridge has been completely demolished; and(vi) The destruction of a large building by fire in the Badische and AnilinWorks.Persons connected with railways have described recent raids as &quot; frightful.&quot;Direct hits were obtained on the lines to Weinheim, Heidelberg and Schwetzingen.The railway viaduct between Ladenburg and Friedrichsfeld was hit and hascollapsed.General. That recent heavy attacks have been successful can be gauged fromthe fact that during the past week General Milch addressed A.R.P. workers,stating : &quot; We cannot look on while great damage is done by fire to our factories.I beg you to continue to work for the A.R.P.,&quot; and that an official reception wasgiven In Berlin to A.R.P. workers from all districts in the Reich, at whichGoebbels himself made an address to encourage them.France.Brest. Photographs taken on the 20th May show a floating crane to be stillalongside the Scharnhorst and a salvage vessel is alongside the quay.
