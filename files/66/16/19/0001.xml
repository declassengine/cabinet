1 o  THIS DOCUMENT IS.THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.W.P.   (4l)&apos;96It is requesjare may be tak&amp;n to&apos;this document Copy No.V/AR   CABINET.GIBRALTAR: FURTHER EVACUATION OF CIVILIANS.Memorandum by thg Secretary of State for theColonies.Last year some. 14-,000 civilians were evacuated from gibraltar, 10,500 to this country, 2,000 to Madeira and thebalance to Jamaica.      The Governor now reports that there are some 4,000 more civilians, mostly able-bodied workmen, who, ifthe fortress were besieged, would not be required for defence purposes.      He recommends, and the military authorities agree,that they too should be evacuated,2.    About 3,200 are British subjects, and 800 Spaniards.Some 2,200 are dockyard workers and the great majority of therest oould &quot;be absorbed into useful employment here.      The Spaniardsare political refugees from Spain, whom the security services areprepared to accept in this country *3.    It may be that the majority of the 4,000 will have toremain at Gibraltar until the last moment, since many are employedin the dockyard and others are engaged on military defence works,but about 500 could he evacuated at once.4.    As the evacuation of these people is necessary formilitary purposes, it must proceed despite the risks that theywill run in crossing the sea.      The Minister of Labour would welcome them in this country.      The Minister of Health, however,feels that this would raise serious problems of which the cabinet should be aware.      I attach an extract from a letter from him.He suggests that they should be sent to Jamaica where accommodation for about 3,500 is available.5.    The objections to Jamaica are:-(a) They could not be employed in Jamaica, where there isalready a serious unemployment problem.      In this country on the contrary their labour would be valuable.(b) Transport to Jamaica would divert ships from other purposes for much longer than transport to this country.      Thedifficulties of protection on the  journey would alsoapparently be increased.(c) The. wives and families of most of the men are already here.(d) The presence in Jamaica of a considerable.labour forcewithout occupation of any sort would cause social andpolitical problems that would he avoided here.6.    So far as I am able tc judge, the balance seems clearlyon the side of bringing these people to this country.    I seek,therefore,  the authority of the Y/ar Cabinet to arrange with theother Departments concerned for the evacuation of these 4,000civilians to this country.7.    It will be necessary to ask the Admiralty to provide protection on the voyage *      I understand that the co-ordinationof. transport-and protection may involve considerable difficultyunless a high priority is given to the matter.Colonial Office, M.2nd May, 1941.
&quot;...1 feel strongly that the very serious problems whichwill &quot;be created by bringing these people to this country oughtto be fully stated and placed on record......1.       The difficulty of finding accommodation.      With thepresent overcrowding of, and the demands on the present capaci^of the country this cannot be over-emphasised.      It will be almost impossible to make adequate arrangements.      The customs, mode of life, etc. of these people are so very different from those of english people as to preclude the possibility of billeting onhouseholders.      This means that accommodation has to be found in large buildings requisitioned for the purpose.b&apos;.        The- difficulty of finding employment.      I notice thatBevin feels&quot; that&apos;there &quot;will be&quot; no&quot; difficulty in arranging for allthe men who speak English to be absorbed into employment, butadmits that the problem of those who do not speak English willnot be so easy.     Experience has shown that only 6Qc/o speakEnglish and even many of those that do are not very proficient.For the reasons in the last paragraph they will need to be accomodated in hostels.      Their wives and families are atpresent in London,  and as they have been separated for so long,it is almost certain that they will refuse to be parted from them,which means that if their work is to be satisfactory, arrangements will have to be made for their families to be accommodated withthem.      This will add greatly to the difficulties, particularly ifthey are to be employed in rural areas, e.g. for work on the land.,.3.       V/hile the Admiralty have promised to absorb all dockyardworkers who can speak English (but only those apparently),accommodation will be most difficult particularly as most of the dockyard towns have suffered severely by enemy action.4.        The Food Situation.      This is not of course within rnyprovince but I feel that the bringing of further numbers into thecountry is to be deprecated.      It is also pertinent to observe thatthese people are most difficult to feed.    . They show markedaversion to English food which leads to much waste.     Ve have beenable to tackle this fairly successfully by the introduction ofGibraltarian dishes and methods of cooking but this is only possible if the people are not dispersed.5.        The feeling which is becoming acute in the country generally against the reception of further foreign refugees.The man-in-the-street will not easily appreciate that these people are British subjects and that their presence here is for thereason of the security of Gibraltar.     He will-as he is doing nowregard them as &quot;foreigners&quot; who are receiving preferential treatment at his expense.I have not dealt with the 1,000 Spaniards whom it ha^been agreed shall be treated as alien refugees but the foregoingapplies with much greater force.To-day Farrow discussed with the Ministry of Shippingwhether it would be possible to ship these people to Jamaica.    I gather that the two most important reasons against this course are that (a) the Prime Minister has instructed that troop movements t&quot;the Middle East shall have priority of shipping and (b) theAdmiralty may have the greatest difficulty in convoying the ships from Gibraltar to Jamaica,      The shipment to this country would notbe too difficult as it would be made by troop shin returning herefrom the Middle East and convoy would be easier to arrange.
