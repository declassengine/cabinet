THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1941. 1 l3MOST SECEET. / Copy No.   2 8W.P. (41) 93. VApril 29, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.PUBLICATION OF SHIPPING LOSSES.Note by the Prime Minister.(Reference W.M. (41) 44th Conclusions, Minute 4.)THE decision to publish sinkings monthly instead of weekly* has been wellaccepted by the Press, and is very convenient from the point of view of the UnitedStates. I am of opinion that we should now move from monthly to Quarterlyfigures, i.e., that we should not publish at the end of this month. The germans will say it is because our losses are so heavy, and this will do no end of good inthe United States.I am sure Parliament and the public here will support us in keeping oursecrets to ourselves. By the time the Quarter is over, we shall very likely haveforgotten about these gratuitous disclosures and be working on the basis of the critical period of the last War.w. s. c.Great George Street, S.W. 1,April 29, 1941.* W.M. (41) 36th Conclusions, Minute 2.[22463]
