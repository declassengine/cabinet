1,      As ray colleagues are aware,  supplies of raw material for civilian clothing have been drastically curtailed;    theamounts of cotton and wool available are not more than about25 per cent,,  of the pre-war- normal.    Hitherto consumers havebeen drawing on the large stocks held by traders and have not felt the full impact of the serere cut in supplies,    stocks are now giving out and shortages are beginning to appear.    Theseshortages will increase rapidly,  and I fear that unless eithersupplies are increased,  or the distribution of the existingsupplies is equalized (which means rationing), some part ofthe population will have to go short of clothing in the autumn and winter;    there will be panic buying and shop queues,prices will rise and the shops will he cleared by the better-to-do,  leaving yet smaller supplies or none at all for the poorerclasses.    I need not dwell on the social consequences of sucha condition of affairs.2.      I have considered very carefully whether suppliesof clothing for the civilian population could he increasedsufficiently to avoid rationing, hut I am convinced that itis not possible.    To meet my proposed rationing scheme wouldrequire some increase in the present allocation of raw materials for civilian clothing;    I revert to this in paragraph Toavoid rationing would require immediately further supplies ofcotton and wool to the amount of at least 200,000 tons a year.Even with the contribution provided by the proposed cuts in service production (which cannot he felt for some months) thebulk of this quantity must be found from stocks or from increased imports.    On the present import programme,  stocksof cotton and wool will,  I understand, be rapidly run down tonear the danger point;    so that any increase   in the allocationfor civilian clothing must mainly he found from an increase in imports.    I should find it difficult in the present shipping situation to justify a demand for increased imports for thispurpose,.3,      Another grave objection is that such an increase inthe supply of clothing would require the employment of atleast 350,000 (and probably 400,000) additional workers (manyin Lancashire)  otherwise available for munitions,  etc,4,      Such an increase in the supply of clothing appearsto me to be contrary to the Governments general economic andfinancial policy, which is aimed at restricting the supplyof unessential goods to the consumer in order both to securethe maximum production capacity and labour for munitions,  and toprevent inflation by directing surplus purchasing power intosavings.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY,It is requested that special care may be taken to insure the secrecy of this document.MOSX.SEORET,WTP.

5,   - We must therefore,  in my opinions-fall back uponthe second alternative, ri ameD ;;\.-ic- -a-secure a fair distributionof supplies.  This can be dans only by rationing and I proposethat a rationing scheme should be introduced on thefollowing lines.6.     With certain exceptions  (e. g0  infants    clothing,.boiler suits and workmen&apos;s overalls), every article of clothing and footwear would be rationed and would be allotted a- prescribed number of couponse    Each personwould be allowed 66 coupons for the coming twelve months and would have to surrender the appropriate number ofcoupons when making purchases of particular articles,,(For example, a raan&apos;s suit would need 13 coupons forthe jacket,  5 for the waistcoat and 8 for the trousers.For children&apos;s goods the ration is more generous.)    Theretailer in his  turn would pass back the same number ofcoupons to replenish his supplies;    this,  incidentallywould ensure a more equitable distribution of supplies bymanufacturers and wholesalers than the present system which tends to give an advantage    to a large firm, ascompared with a small firm...7.      In Appendix A are shown some specimen budgetswhich indicate how the individual might choose to use hiscoupons.    Appendix E contains tables  comparing theaverage annual consumption per heal of certain garments -in peace time with an estimate of possible consumptionunder the rationing proposals,,    I would add that the ration proposed in somewhat higher than that ailowed tothe German population, a difference which is largely increased by the more durable quality of our clothes,8,      The clothing ration under this  scheme willnot bear hardly on the poorer people,  particularly assecond-hand goods are outside the scheme.    It will,however, mean drastic curtailment of their purchases bythe better-off  people who normally buy much more clothingthan the proposed ration;    but they have stocks in theirwardrobes and can afford to buy the most durable articles,9,      I must explain that this ration,   austere thoughit may seem,  is in excess of the supplies coming forward from some of the industries restricted by raw materialcontrol;    to some extent we can bridge the gap by drawing on the stocks of manufactured goods that are inthe hands of traders (but these are rapidly dwindling -a strong reason for not delaying the operation of the rationing scheme) and for the rest we hope to rely onthe proposed economies in Service demands.    But there may still be a gap.  widened  by the need to refit a large and increasing number of people who lose all their clothingin air raids,  and I may well have to urge later that theneeds of the civil population demand increased suppliesof raw material for the manufacture of clothing,  even ifit should mean diverting shipping space allocated to food and munitions of war.10.      I will not trouble my colleagues with the manydetails of the scheme, which has been examined and generally approved by the lord President&apos;s Committee.    A decision is urgently required;    I should propose to introduce the scheme on the 1st June, which is a particularly convenient dateadministratively.    Any delay would be dangerous.11.      I must stress the need of the utmost secrecy inorder to avoid a run on the shops before the scheme is introduced.Board of Trade, 0&quot; L&quot;20th May,  1941. ^.s^
