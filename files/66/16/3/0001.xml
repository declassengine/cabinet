THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1941.SECRET./Copy No.W.P. (41) 80.April 8, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINETCOMPLETION OF THE THORNTON PLANT.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production:SINCE the decision taken by the War Cabinet in November 1940 to complete the erection of the Thornton Plant for the production of 100 Octane Fuel, new-considerations have arisen and the position has been in several respects materiallyaltered : (i) It has been discovered that most of our bomber aircraft can operate at maximum efficiency on fuel other than 100 Octane. The estimated requirements of the Royal Air Force for this fuel have in consequencebeen markedly decreased. Refinery capacity in the United States,together with the Heysham and Trinidad plants, should be sufficientto cover these requirements in 1943 as well as in 1942.(ii) The need to restrict our purchases of 100 Octane Fuel from the UnitedStates owing to shortage of dollar exchange has been eliminated bythe passage of the Lease-Lend Act.(iii) It was assumed last November that production at Thornton would havecommenced by the middle of 1942. But shortage of labour and thefact that this Plant was specifically placed by the War Cabinet onlower priority than the Heysham Plant, also in course of erection,make it unlikely that production can be started before mid-1943 orfull production achieved before 1944. It has been possible to recruitonly 2,000 of the 4,000 building personnel required.(iv) In the last four months the problem of shipping space has grown moreacute. The abandonment of the Thornton project would be a.substantial contribution to the solution of this problem. For four tonsof feed-stock will have to be shipped by tanker for every three tonsof petrol produced in the plant, of which only one and a half tons are suitable for aviation purposes. A full year&apos;s production at Thorntonwill mean the loss of 185,000 tons of snipping space,(v) If work on this plant is discontinued, 2,000 men engaged on site labour,as well as a large number of manufacturers and a considerable amountof construction materials, will be freed for other, and urgent work.The only valid argument, in the changed circumstances, for the completionof this Plant, is that it is necessary as an insurance against the destruction ofHeysham. But, in my view, this cannot be held as a justification for continuingwith a project that is in other respects wasteful and unnecessary, especially as theinsurance cannot become fully effective for another two years.I ask, therefore, for a reversal of the decision taken by the War Cabinet attheir meeting of the 7th November, 1940.B.Ministry of Aircraft Production, S.W. 1,April 8, 1941.[22401]
