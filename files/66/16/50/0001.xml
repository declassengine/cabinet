WAR CABINET \/ Copy Wo. &apos;     -UQW^TT41) 127. &quot; .June 7. 1941. Publication of Shipping Losses.Memorandum by the First&apos;Lord of the Admiralty.- -        -  .1.     /In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet at -their meetingon the 26th May, (W.M.  (41)53).    I have examined the question of thepublication of naval and merchant ship losses.    The following are therules now applied : -Warships.The general rule is to announce losses as soon as the next-of-kinhave been informed, but the announcement of the loss of moreimportant units is&apos; not infrequently delayed beyond that time for operational reasons.   Account is also taken of the psychological effect of publishing several losses simultaneously.     The form ofthe announcement varies according to circumstances, the oause ofsinking sometimes being given and sometimes concealed.. Damage to H.M.Ships is not published unless(a) it is considered desirable to admit, it for propaganda or other reasons and(b) it is certainly known to the enemy,.Merchant Ships.Announcements of losses of&apos; individual ships&apos;are not normally made,but the total number and the total tonnage are given periodically,. british allied and neutral figures being given separately.From early in the war until the end of March, 1941, these totals weregiven weekly, but sinoe then under Cabinet instructions&quot; they are.being given monthly.     These monthly totals are. published on aboutthe 15th of the month following the one for which the figures are/calculated....;....
calculated, the delay being necessary to enable doubtfuT cases to be confirmed.    . Damage to merchant ships is not announced.    If storiesbreak abroad of loss or damage to merchant vessels, eikg.&apos;, f^om survivorslanded at a foreign port, the story is released.to the British press, but no of ficial-announcement, is made. ...   ;    . .....2.    1*1 the framing ^and,application of the above rules an attempt, has. beenyaade.&apos;.to reconcile ,the following, faptpra:.,- ,   ..(a) Premature announcements of individual naval ormerchant shipping losses undoubtedly provide theenemy -with valuable.,inf omation,. -...      ,,   .....     ....(b) ilqurnfulrepetition of shipping.,losses day by day,ha-s a bad psychological effect at home, but iflosses are..not .published periodically the.public-.. becomes. equally, uneasy.,(q.) Announcements qf,.heavy losses as they occur may spurthe-United States.., to, .give .us- more, active assistance,but at,-the. same-time.,encourage, the enemy, and ,unduly depress. our own people...   ., -......... .(d) Departure from.general rules ..for propaganda purposesmay-defeat, itself unless,, pareful^y. handled since the motivefor the particular announcement being easily discerned may to .some,. extent, destroy its, effect.........._________ ,3,   I -am of..the opinion that, no,.;change should be made in. the announcement ofnaval losses, and that with -regard, to merchant shipping a desire to avoid providing/the enemy with gratuitous information must still be the determining factor in our policy.--.    The propaganda side of. our. shipping losses has not been overlooked in-the. past., but I. suggest that, in view,of the. great importance now attached toinforming^ United..States, opinion,, qf our...serious shipping situation the Admiralty     ishould be authorised to depart from normal practice whenever they, the ForeignOffice and the Ministry of Information, are all agreed that some special announce-ment would provide effective propaganda in the United States while not undulydepressing our own people. fAdmiralty, -S.W.1. &apos; A.V.A.June 7, 1941.
