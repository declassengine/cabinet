South Atlantic.5. The Vichy French s.s. Criton (4,564 tons) was intercepted by H.M.Armed Merchant Cruiser Cilicia on the 9th, 400 miles North of Freetown, andhas been escorted into that port. The Master stated that instructions to scuttleFrench ships if intercepted are no longer in force.The French s .s. Bourbonnais (4,484 tons), carrying 400 native troops toMadagascar, was intercepted by H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Bulolo on the13th, 100 miles S.W. of Dakar, and is being taken in to Freetown.Mediterranean.6. The Mediterranean Fleet and the Gibraltar Force have been engaged inescorting and covering important convoy movements. One convoy of five ships carrying military stores and supplies from the United Kingdom passed throughthe Straits of Gibraltar and arrived on the 12th at Alexandria with the loss ofone ship, the Empire Song (9,228 tons), which was mined and sunk in the SicilianChannel. The s.s. New Zealand Star also struck a mine but proceeded with the convoy.   Two convoys from Alexandria arrived at Malta on the 9th withoutv&quot; AN important convoy from the United Kingdom has&apos; reached Alexandriavia&apos; the Mediterranean. -1 The port of Benghazi has twice been successfully bombarded by our light forces.Our shipping losses during the week are rather lower than of late.Home Waters.2. Cruiser patrols have been maintained in the Iceland-Faroes channel and in the Denmark Straits throughout the week.M.T.Bs. carried out offensive sweeps off the Belgian and Dutch coasts.; 3. Blenheims of the Bomber Command claim to have sunk a destroyer, or naval auxiliary, of 2,000 tons off the Texel on the night of the 8th/9th. our aircraft during the week have sunk or damaged nine enemy merchant vessels in home Waters totalling 39,600 tons.During air raids on the night of the 10t)h/llth on London, the AuxiliaryPatrol Depot Ship Gypsy and 8 motor-boats were sunk at Tower Pier and theA. A. Ship Goat fell Was damaged. On the night of the llth/12th the torpedowarhead and depth-charge store at Felixstowe was demolished, and some damage was done in the dockyard at Pembroke. On the night of the 12th/13th oneoil cistern was set on fire at Devonport.&apos;u;- In addition to the casualties mentioned above, 4 auxiliary vessels were sunk and 4 were damaged.   Details are given in Appendix V.North Atlantic.4. H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Salopian was torpedoed and abandoned650 miles south-west of Iceland early on the 13th. 278 survivors are on boardH.M. Destroyer Impulsive.The Italian tanker Gianna M. (5,719 tons) was captured on the 10th byH.M. Ocean Boarding Vessel Hilary 325 miles north of the Azores.The German trawler Munchen has been captured in northern waters byH.M. Destroyer Somali.During the week five French merchant vessels eastbound and six westboundhave passed Gibraltar under escort.H.M.S. Illustrious has arrived in American waters for refit.
mishap, although the harbour had been heavily mined by enemy aircraft and hadto be cleared by emergency measures. Exceptional weather conditions of poorvisibility persisted throughout almost the whole of these operations. No enemysurface warships were encountered, but repeated air attacks were ineffectuallymade by German and Italian bombers and torpedo-bombers, which were beatenoff by our naval fighters and by the ships&apos; guns. One destroyer, H.M.S. Fortune,was hit, but was able.to proceed at reduced speed. Nine enemy aircraft were shot down for the loss of seven FA.A. aircraft, of which two only were due to enemy action.7. Benghazi has twice been shelled by H.M. Ships during the week.H.M. Cruiser Ajax with four destroyers, on the night of the 8th/9th, sank an ammunition ship of 5,000 tons and another supply vessel of 3,000 tons approaching the harbour. Hits were also obtained on other shipping inside the port. On thesecond occasion, the night of the 10th/11th, four destroyers fired nearly 900 roundsat very close range at shipping and military objectives. They were attacked bydive-bombers without success. ,H.M. Gunboat Ladybird shelled a landing ground at Gazala during the night of the 10th/11th, causing several fires. Gazala was again bombarded on the night of the 13th/14th by H.M. Gunboat Gnat. On the afternoon of the 13th,dive-bombers attacked and sank H.M.S. Ladybird in Tobruk harbour. !H.M. Submarine Usk is overdue at Malta and must be considered lost.8. On the 12th Swordfish of the Fleet Air Arm attacked an enemy convoybound for Tripoli and hit a destroyer and a merchant vessel of 8,000 tons.9. Merchant shipping lost during the transport of the expeditionary forces to Greece totalled 36,000 tons, with 6,000 tons damaged. During the evacuation from Greece the totals were 147,000 tons lost and 57,000 tons damaged. &apos;10. The French Gallium (1,775 tons) was intercepted on the 8th byH.M. Submarine Truant 180 miles east of Gibraltar, but was released from escortby a French destroyer.Anti-Submarine Operations.11. Four attacks were carried out by H.M. Ships during the week onU-Boats, all in the North-Western Approaches, but without conclusive results,.The most promising of these was made on the 9th by H.M. Destroyers Niagaraand St. Clair, 150 miles W.N.W. of Blacksod Bay. A Catalonia flying-boat, onthe 11th, made an attack 100 miles west of Ireland.Enemy Intelligence. -German. -12. The main strength of the German Fleet is now believed to be at Kieland in the Baltic, except for the battle-cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, which remain at Brest, and the 8-inch cruiser Seydlitz, which was photographed atBremen on the night of the 9th/10th. Three destroyers which were in Bordeauxon the 5th May arrived at La Pallice on the 11th May. *A succession of transports is reported to have proceeded from Germany to northern Norway during late March and early April.U-Boats.13. There have been fourteen or fifteen German U-Boats and five or sixItalians in the North-Western Approaches during the week. They have been disposed much as before, but activity has been on a low scale except for a prolonged attack on an outward-bound convoy S.W. of Iceland, which lasted forthree days.[22521] b
j Jn addition to the main concentrations in the North, there have been some three Germans west of Freetown, one or two Italians in the Madeira-Canariesarea, and possibly one German off the coast of Brazil.Ear Eastern Intelligence.14. There is evidence that the Japanese have not up to date made any claim for the use of naval bases in Indo-China.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.15, Shipping losses during the period have been below the average for thepast two months, They have been mainly due to TJ-boats, which made a successful attack on an outward bound convoy to the south-west of Iceland (C) and sankseveral ships to the westward of Freetown.Air attacks on coastal convoys, although persistent, were not very effective;but some losses were caused by aircraft operating in the North-western approaches.  Several ships were damaged during the air raids on Hull.According to the information available up to the 14th May, shipping losses in April (details of which are given in Appendix I) were 177 ships totalling523,000 tons, of which 45 ships were Allied or neutral.Thirty-nine ships (230,000 tons) were sunk by U-boat, 31 of them in the atlantic and North-Western Approaches, and 8 off Freetown. Sixty-four ships(249,000 tons) were sunk by aircraft, 40 of them in the Mediterranean, and theremainder in Home Waters and the North-Western Approaches.For the first time losses by air attack have exceeded those by U-boats, butthis is due to the heavy casualties incurred in the Mediterranean. Apart fromthe Mediterranean, shipping losses have tended to show a slight improvement.Protection of Seaborne Trade.16. During April 3,372 ships were convoyed and twenty-two ships, totalling120,471 tons, were sunk while under escort. Eleven of these ships were lost throughU-boat attack on two convoys. In the week under review two battleships, onecruiser, 9 armed merchant cruisers, one anti-aircraft ship, 5 submarines, 60destroyers and 65 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the10th May totalled 891,156 tons, as compared with the 557,968 tons for the previousweek, and an average of 695,048 tons for the past ten weeks. Twenty-six tankersbrought in 245,291 tons of oil, as compared with 171,809 tons of the previousweek. Mineral imports were 209,223 tons; eight ships being loaded with iron ore, two with manganese ore, three with phosphates and phosphate rock and threewith scrap iron. Timber imports were 31,922 tons and cereals 239,528 tonsTwenty-one ships were laden with wheat, three with grain and one with pulse.Other food imports totalled 131,962 tons and included quantities of meat, tea,butter and cheese.   Two ships brought in 18,761 tons of sugar.British Minelaying.. ; 17. There has been no minelaying by surface craft during the period under-review, but a few mines have been laid by aircraft off the French Channel andAtlantic ports and a few off the German North Sea Coast!Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.18. Mines were dropped from aircraft in the Thames on the night of the10th/11th May and have been suspected during the week off ports in the south-west of England and in large numbers off the Durham coast. Mines were alsodropped in Liverpool Bay on two nights early in the week, but otherwise therehas been no minelaying on the west coast north of Milford Haven. The enemy has taken to dropping mines without parachutes.
The organisations for mine-watching have proved very valuable both in the thames and on the Clyde. During the heavy raid on London during the night of the 10th/11th May many mines were dropped in the Thames; these weremarked and the River was closed for only one dayTwenty magnetic mines and four acoustic mines have been exploded duringthe week in Home Waters in widely separated localities. The mine totals(including Foreign Waters) are now 1,140 magnetic, 597 acoustic and 864 contact.Foreign Waters.19. The Suez Canal has been raided on three nights of the week. Manymines and bombs were dropped in and about the northern section of the Canal,which is closed.  Five mines have been detonated.At least three mines were detonated during the week at Malta and three.havebeen accounted for off Alexandria. .-;Dangerous areas have been declared off the Tunisian Coast, where enemymines are suspected.S.A. Trawler Aurora II and the L.L. Whaler Svana swept a channel toGazala on the 11th May preparatory to the bombardment of this port by H.M.S.Ladybird.Enemy Merchant Shipping.20. Two Norwegian oil refinery ships, each of about 12,000 tons, whichwere captured by a German raider in the South Atlantic in mid-January were at Bordeaux on the 5th May.A Bulgarian ship of 1,994 tons and a German ship of 1,756 tons, fully-loaded, passed Istanbul bound for the JEgean on the 7th and the 8th respectively.:One Italian of 3,175 tons and a Bulgarian of 2,300 tons arrived at Istanbul onthe 10th May to load for the JEgean.Three German ships are reported to have left Constanza for Salonika on the,12th loaded with ammunition under a covering of forage. ;MILITARY SITUATION.Operations.Egypt and Libya.21. At Tobruk on the 10th May our patrols surprised and shot up a working party of 300 Italians and withdrew before enemy tanks could intervene.In the Sollum area an attempt was made on the 8th May to dislodge theenemy from Halfaya. This however failed and on the 9th May enemy armoured forces advanced from Sidi Omar towards Sidi Suleiman. Our troops engagedthem and subsequently withdrew without serious loss. Since then sand stormsand extreme heat have limited activity.A abyssinia. &apos;    &apos;22. Activity continues in the Amba Alagi area. On the 5th May weoccupied further high ground capturing one company of the M.T. battalion of theGrenadier Division. During an attack on the 9th May heavy casualties were:caused by bombs thrown by Italians flying a white flag.Iraq.23. As a result of vigorous ground and air action the enemy force concen-trated at Habbaniya withdrew on the 9th May eastwards to Fallujah and west-ward to Ramadi carrying out demolitions and inundations covering these two-towns.[22521] b 2
On the 11th May Rutbah was abandoned by the enemy and has been occu-pied by armoured cars of the Arab Legion.-     Conditions at Basra appear to be returning to normal.24.   The following units have arrived in Iraq :-Strength.! Three battalions and Force H.Q., H.Q. 21  Ind.Inf. Bde.     ............       ...       ...      2,500Remainder of second Brigade Group, base and L. ofC. units      ..................      2,500Field regiment, field company, administrative units      3,000Crete. -25. The present garrison in Crete under the command of Major-GeneralFreyberg consists of : 14 Inf. Bde.One Aust. Bde.Two N.Z. Bdes.Three light A.A. Btys.Two heavy A.A. Btys.and ancillary units.In addition there are Greek troops under training who are being organisedfor the defence of the island.Intelligence.Syria, Iraq and Turkey.26. There are strong indications that Germany intends to send to Iraq theassistance for which the latter country is urgently asking. Three German aircraftarrived at Aleppo on 9th May, alleging that they had lost their way. They left for an unknown destination. The arrival of some German aircraft in Damascusis also reported.The French authorities are known to have sent two train-loads ofammunition eastwards, but deny that they are destined for Iraq on german demands.27. Enemy agents are believed to be entering Iraq from Turkey and Iran,presumably to assist the Fifth Column already organised there and to prepare for the reception of German airborne troops. Germany is reported to have promised to come to the help of Iraq within a fortnight irrespective of whetherTurkey agrees to the passage of troops or not.28. It is reported that Germany intends to isolate Turkey by occupyingSyria rather than to attack her directly. It seems, however, impossible for germany to send an effective land force to Syria or Iraq without using the landroute across Anatolia. There are other indications that the centre of gravity of German activities at the moment has moved to S.E. Europe, and it seems probable that developments in Iraq have led the Germans (whatever their earlierplans may have been) to concentrate for the moment on the eastern mediterranean and beyond.By advancing through Turkey into Syria and at the same time renewingtheir offensive in North Africa they could develop once again the pincer movement-vvhich they have used so consistently in all their recent campaigns.Yugoslavia and Greece.29. The Italians announce their occupation of Southern Yugoslavia,proceeding from Eastern Albania, up to the line Pecs-Prizren-Tetovo-Kicevo,and of Epirus, Acarnania and Altolia in Greece, i.e., of the whole of WesternGreece north of the Gulf of Patras. There are unconfirmed reports of guerillaactivity in Montenegro and in Southern Serbia.Nearly all the islands, including Chios, Mitylene, Samos, Kythera and Melos.are now in enemy hands.
Roumania. . &apos;- .&apos;;V-&apos;-.1-&apos; &apos;30. Whatever Germany&apos;s real intentions in S.E. Europe may be, Roumanianmilitary circles are being led to expect that the co-operation of the Roumanianarmy will shortly be required for an attack on Russia. Roumanian irredentismover Bessarabia is being openly encouraged and the usual sources indicate that conversations between the German and Roumanian staffs are in progress. russian military maps are being issued to all Roumanian officers. Such a policy does notnecessarily indicate that an attack on Russia is planned for the immediate future..Spain.31. Ail the indications point to preparations for a move into Spain beingalmost complete, but German thoroughness may want to be assured of additionalrailway facilities before commencing operations. If there were no Spanishresistance the occupation of the country could be carried out by the troops alreadynear the Spanish frontier, and consequently very little warning (in the form oftroop concentrations, heavy train movements, &amp;c.) could be expected.Portugal.32. German propaganda has been making play with alleged British and american intentions to occupy the Azores and is hinting at the necessity for&quot;protecting&quot; Portugal. A report that Germany has assured Salazar thatPortuguese neutrality will be respected has in itself a somewhat sinister ring.Morocco.33. It is reported that war material has been filtering through from Spain to spanish. Morocco, and it is possible that some of it at least is intended for Germanuse, for other reports refer to the passage of German motor transport throughTunis to Tripolitania. There are indications that Germany has put pressure on Vichy to deliver up a large number of motor vehicles already in north africa, It is believed that the Vichy Government agreed, but that general weygand, after consenting to deliver not more than 200 vehicles, subsequentlydeclined to hand over any at all. Further information is lacking, but that this demand should have been made at all by Germany confirms the view /thattransport difficulties are hampering German operations in Cyrenaica.U.S.S.R.34. Additional confirmation has been received of the gradual strengthening of German forces all along the Russian frontier from the North of Norway tothe Black Sea, and. it is suggested that preparations for operations against russia will soon be complete. It is also reported that S.S. contingents are being formed among emigrants from the Ukraine and the Baltic States, and that pro-German Governments for these territories are being planned.There are indications of possible Roumanian co-operation in a move against russia, at least as far as Bessarabia is concerned.35. Reports from various quarters some of them probably inspired byGermany stress the inevitability of a clash between Germany and Russiaeventually, but they differ as to the probable date. June and July are mentionedas the earliest possibilities, but this seems somewhat optimistic.It is probable that no decision has yet been taken as to whether Russia is tobe persuaded by threats to comply with German wishes or should be attacked.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. During the week, Bomber Command carried out their heaviest attack of the war. Our aircraft have again made a number of successful attacks on enemy coastal shipping.A heavy concentrated attack was made on London. Our night fighters havebeen conspicuously successful. Malta and Crete were attacked on several occasions.
Germany and Occupied Territory.General.37. During the week Bomber Command flew 85 day and 953 night sorties,which is a decrease in the scale of day operations and an increase in night operations as compared with the previous week. The largest number of aircraftyet detailed since the outbreak of war, namely 383, were despatched on the night of the 8th/9th May to attack targets in Germany, the main efforts being concentrated on Hamburg and Bremen.Day.38. Most of the daylight attacks have again been directed against enemycoastal shipping, details of which are given under Coastal Operations. Thenaval base at Heligoland was attacked on the 13th Mayrby ten Blenheims.Bombs were dropped on jetties and buildings, causing a number of fires, andbarracks and gun positions were attacked with machine-gun fire.Night.39. Aircraft of the Bomber Command, taking advantage of good visibility,made heavy attacks on several important enemy objectives on five nights of theweek. The shipyards and the industrial centre of Hamburg were attacked on three nights by a total of 357 aircraft, and similar targets at Bremen were attacked on two nights by a total of 198. Nearly 280 tons of H.E. bombs,including twelve 4,000-lb. bombs, and 25,000 incendiaries were dropped onHamburg, and 180 tons of H.E. bombs and 35,000 incendiaries on Bremen.Direct hits were scored on the Blohm and Voss shipyards, the Rhenania Ossagoil refinery, and the Tiefstack electrical power station, at Hamburg, and on the shipyards at Bremen. Large fires were started in both cities, and those at hamburg could be seen seventy miles away.40. The industrial centres of Mannheim and Ludwigshafen were attackedtwice, by a total of 185 aircraft. On the first occasion visibility was good andexcellent results were obtained, nearly sixty tons of H.E. bombs and 7,500incendiaries being dropped into the target area. The large concentration offires which resulted could be seen by our returning aircraft when they wereninety miles away.Attacks on a smaller scale were made on the industrial centre of Berlin andon the docks at Bremerhaven, Emden, Rotterdam, Ostend and Calais.41. Aircraft of Coastal Command! attacked the docks at St. Nazaire on two occasions and direct hits were obtained on dock buildings, on the railway station and on the customs house. Other successful attacks were made on enemy supplyships and on oil stores at La Pallice, on &quot; E &quot; Boats at Boulogne and at Ijmuidenand on several aerodromes in Norway.42. Fighter Command aircraft carried out offensive patrols over the low countries and Northern France on six nights of the week. Bombs were dropped on several aerodromes.United Kingdom.43. Fighter Command flew 2,661 patrols, involving 3,808 sorties, by day,and 1,402 additional sorties were flown by night. The daylight effort of theenemy fighter force was slightly increased, but at night 1,070 long-range bombers were employed, which showed a reduction compared with the previous week.44. By day, the usual enemy reconnaissances were flown, and defensivefighter patrols were maintained over the Dover Straits and over coastal areas.A number of small-scale offensive daylight sweeps covered Kent and South andSouth-West Coastal regions; our fighters destroyed eighteen Me. 109&apos;s, andprobably destroyed six others. We lost six aircraft, but four of the pilots were saved. Ten Me. 109&apos;s dived from 29,000 feet to 100 feet to attack Rochfordaerodrome, and destroyed the control office.45. London was heavily attacked on the night of the 10th/11th May; it isestimated that 320 Bombers were engaged, about 30 of which carried out twosorties.   During this attack, our night fighters destroyed twenty-seven of the
raiders, probably destroyed five and damaged eleven others; anti-aircraft gunsshot down six. In addition, our bombers destroyed five enemy aircraft during their operations over Germany. Details of other night attacks are referred to inthe Home Security Situation; these were mostly of a scattered nature, and a feature has been the decline in effort since the full moon and the heavy losses sustained on the 10th/11th. Sixty-four enemy night bombers were destroyed during the week.46. Royal Air Force Stations were bombed on many occasions, moreparticularly on the night of the 11th/ 12th May, when thirty-nine stations reportedattacks. The damage was not of a serious nature, but some buildings and hangarswere hit and a number of aircraft were damaged, and casualties occurred amongstthe personnel. During one night, 200 bombs were dropped at St. Eval, the attacklasting over four hours. At Watton, a Ju. 88 machine-gunned the station andwas brought down by A.A. Lewis guns.Coastal Operations.47. Coastal Command flew 275 patrols and provided escorts for 95 convoys,involving a total of 865 sorties. In addition, Fighter Command flew 1,908 sortieson shipping protection patrols.48. Bomber Command aircraft have again made several successful attacks on enemy shipping.  The following received direct hits : A 700-ton Flak-ship off Stavanger.A 500-ton M.V. off the Dutch Coast.A 350-ton trawler off the Dutch Coast.A 2,000-ton destroyer or naval auxiliary off Texel.   Believed sunk.Two 500-ton coasters at Maasluis.  Probably sunk.A 12,000-ton supply ship at St. Nazaire.A 2,000-ton M.V. off Ushant.  Left sinking.Three M.V.S of 5,000, 4,000 and 1,600 tons respectively off the island of Wangeroog.  All set on fire.Several other ships were attacked but results could not be observed.On the 14th May a Coastal Command Beaufort torpedoed an enemy supplyship of 5,000 tons in an escorted convoy off the Dutch Coast.49. Ten successful minelaying sorties were flown by Bomber Command, and nine by Coastal Command. Enemy minelayers operated on a larger scale thanin the previous week, covering the East Coast, the Bristol Channel, Liverpool bay and the Southern Irish Sea.50. Enemy bomber-reconnaissance aircraft carried out normal routinepatrols during the week. The Condor Unit, which is operating He. Ill as wellas F.W. 200 aircraft, carried out reconnaissance flights over the Western and north-Western Approaches. Weather flights from Trondheim have also covered the area of Jan Mayen Island and to north of Iceland (C) on two or three occasions during the week. A few long-range torpedo-carrying reconnaissancefloat-planes operated over the Bay of Biscay. A detachment of about six Ju. 87dive-bombers engaged on armed reconnaissance of shipping is now operating from Banak, near Hammerfest. These aircraft have a maximum radius of actionof 180 miles.Malta.51. Five night attacks were made on the Island by German aircraft; onthe night llth/12th May thirty enemy bombers maintained the attack for fiveand a half hours. The main target was Luqa aerodrome, which was damaged,together with some buildings; a hangar was also hit, and one Maryland and aWellington were destroyed and other aircraft seriously damaged. In addition,damage was inflicted on civilian property and many houses were demolished.Two barrack blocks were destroyed and damage was caused to the dockyardand to a hospital. Three attacks were also made in daylight, when fighterspredominated.
52. Beaufighters on a standing patrol shot down a Ju. 88, and Hurricaneson two occasions intercepted Ju. 87&apos;s attacking shipping, and destroyed two ofthem and probably destroyed two others. A Sunderland was attacked at itsmoorings by seven Me. 109&apos;s and set on fire, while five Hurricanes were shot downby enemy fighters and one Beaufighter is missing.53. On the 10th May nine Beaufighters made a very good attack on Cataniaand Comiso aerodromes, where considerable damage is believed to have beeninflicted. Two Ju. 52&apos;s, three bombers, and a number of other aircraft were seton fire and further aircraft damaged. A.bout 30 officers were machine-gunnedon the run.Crete and Eastern Mediterranean.54. On the night of 12th / 13th May enemy aircraft operating singly bombedSuda Bay for seven hours. The attack was repeated during daylight on 13th and14th May, and included the aerodromes at Heraklion and Melemo, but no serious damage resulted.  Eight enemy aircraft were shot down and another was damaged.55. Over 500 German transport aircraft are concentrated in Greece, themajority in the neighbourhood of Athens. At least twenty-five of the fifty Italianlong-range bombers at present in the /aegean are now equipped for torpedo carry-ing. Two Me. 110 units, totalling about sixty aircraft, are reported to have beenfitted with extra tanks. One of these may operate from Rhodes, within range ofAlexandria. Rhodes may also be reinforced by additional German aircraft, con-sisting of Ju. 88 and Me. 110. The Germans are believed to be preparing an airbase on the Island of Melos, about eighty miles south-east of Athens.Egypt and Libya.56. Our bombers continued their attacks on the enemy aerodromes at Derna,Jedabaya, Benina and Gazala. On the night of 11th/12th May, Wellingtonsdestroyed one Me. 110 and four He. lll&apos;s at Benina and, at Derna and Gazala,bombs burst amongst grounded aircraft destroying four single-engined fighters,in addition to which about six aircraft were severely damaged by machine-gunfire. Benghazi harbour was attacked and some large fires were started; bombs were also seen to drop very near two 5,000 ton vessels, and on buildings near themilitary headquarters and Government House.On the night of 10th/11th May, four Wellingtons from Malta scored severalhits on the Spanish Mole, and near the Power Station at Tripoli. At the sametime four Swordfish laid sea mines in the harbour.57. M.T. vehicles were attacked with good results on a number of occasions.On 12th May, twenty-two Hurricanes and Blenheims successfully machine-gunned the enemy during his withdrawal from Sofafi to the Capuzzo area.58. Enemy aircraft, believed to be German, attacked Tobruk harbour on four occasions. On the first, A.A. guns accounted for three of these and probably destroyed two others. The third attack, which was on the 12th May, wascarried out by forty-six enemy aircraft, on the south of the harbour. Two A.A.positions were hit and one gun was put out of action. Three of the attackingaircraft were probably destroyed, and, during a subsequent attack, several others were damaged.59. There has been a slight increase in German long-range bombers in libya, but the reinforcement Of this theatre is proceeding comparatively slowly.Iraq.60. At Habbaniya, the situation has remained quiet since the Iraqis were driven from their positions overlooking the cantonment. Rutbah was evacuatedon the 11th May after action by Royal Air Force armoured cars and repeatedattacks by aircraft.61. Apart from reconnaissance and standing patrols, operations have been confined to attacks on Iraqi aerodromes and military establishments. Rashidwas bombed by Wellingtons and by aircraft of No. 4 Flying Training School;
direct hits were obtained on hangars, barracks and other buildings, and on three occasions the petrol dump at the aerodrome was attacked. Attacks were also made on Baghdad Air Port, and on aerodromes at Baquba, Mosul, and Shahraban.At Mosul, twelve direct hits were registered on the barracks and, at Shahraban,ten aircraft were destroyed on the ground. Barracks were also hit at Washshash,Masiriya and Qaraghan.62. On the 13th May, a Blenheim fighter on a reconnaissance over Mosul was intercepted by a Me. 110; the enemy broke off the engagement after four verydetermined attacks; it may have been hit by the Blenheim rear gun. On the14th May, six monoplanes, believed to be Me. 109&apos;s, were seen at Erbil, fifty miles east of Mosul, and three Heinkel lll&apos;s have also been reported.63. With their present commitments in Libya and the vEgean, the germans might make available up to thirty fighters and thirty long-range bombers for operations in Iraq. Sufficient transport aircraft for the supply of this force could also be found. It has been reported that approximately thirty german aircraft have landed in Syria up to the 12th May, at Damascus, Aleppo andRayak. The passage of German aircraft through Syria to Iraq appears to beeffected with the connivance of the French Authorities.64. It is estimated that the Iraqi Air Force has now been reduced to a totalof about fifty aircraft of which only six are first line operational types.Abyssinia.65. Our aircraft continued their attacks on enemy positions at Amba Alagiin close support of land operations.   The fort was hit on several occasions. .Aircraft also attacked enemy positions and M.T. near Wadera, Gimma,Uondo and Sciasciamanna in Southern Abyssinia, and North of Debareeh inNorthern Abyssinia.General Air Intelligence.Dispositions of the German Air Force.66. A table showing the general disposition of the German Air Force isgiven at Appendix VIII. Movements indicate that a certain amount of refittingis in progress. Apart from the slight increase of long-range bombers in north africa, the most interesting feature is the concentration of transport aircraft in greece.  Local movements are reported in the relevant paragraphs above.A zores.67. Reports received suggest that the Portuguese Government is makingserious efforts to provide for the air defence of the Azores. It is stated that onefighter squadron, probably equipped with fourteen Gladiators, will be transferredto Achada from the mainland in the near future, and that the Achada landing-ground is itself in course of improvement. A stock of 100-kg. bombs has been shipped to Ponta Delgada, and an A.A. battery is understood to have beenestablished at a point near Arrifes.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.68.   Enemy bombing has been negligible.By Night.69. The principle event of the week was a heavy and concentrated bombing attack on London on the 10th/11th May, causing considerable damage and many casualties. On the first two nights of the period Barrow and Hull were bombed and Nottingham had its first serious attack. On the 11th/12th May bombing waswidespread, many R.A.F. aerodromes being attacked. On the last three nightsbombing was on a very minor scale.Other places attacked were chiefly in the north of England and in the southand south-west.   Some damage and casualties were caused.[22521] c
Damage.London.70. The main weight of the attack fell on the Central and City areas, butbombing was also widespread and affected sixty boroughs.The main problem was the incendiary bomb and the fire situation, aggravated by a serious water shortage. Damage to residential, commercial and publicproperty was very extensive.71. Damage to the docks is substantial, but the ability of the port as a whole to handle traffic is probably little affected.The river wall at Southwark and the embankment at Chelsea were damaged.Tower Pier and the floating pier at Billingsgate were hit. The river, however,remained open except for a few restrictions.72. There was considerable dislocation of transport, especially the railways.Atone time all the railway termini were closed except Marylebone.Utility services stood up to the attack well. Gas was most affected; five gasworks and many mains were damaged. Water pressure was low in most boroughsas the result of the fracture of 47 large and 100 smaller mains. Six electric power stations were hit, but interruption of services was only temporary. Damage to telephone services and equipment seriously affected communications from london to various parts of the country.73. Damage to public buildings was extensive. Amongst the buildingsdamaged were the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey and the british museum. Several Halls of City Companies were destroyed and five churches andfourteen hospitals affected.About eighteen important industrial concerns received hits during the raid.Hull.74. There were extensive fires in the Dock area, affecting especially theKing George and Alexandra Docks. Railway dislocation seriously interfered with dock working.Utility services escaped lightly, but damage to property was widespread and caused a large increase in the number of homeless.Seven factories were affected, some receiving severe damage.Nottingham.75. In its first raid considerable damage was caused by fire to shops, offices and commercial premises; 500 houses were demolished.Severe damage was caused to utility services, especially those of water and gas, but only two factories were reported as damaged.Elsewhere.76. Some damage was caused in Docks and to a few factories, but chiefly to private property.General Situation on Merseyside.77. The dock system is chiefly affected by the major working difficulties ofthe railways, inside and outside the dock area, but clearance of lines is being effected.On the 12th May road transport was still in operation to railheads, and workers could be taken to and from work without difficulty by road. In spite ofthe heavy loss of vehicles, considerable quantities of goods are being moved dailyfrom the docks.Utility services have greatly improved, but difficulty has occurred inobtaining rail borne coal and gas supplies.Casualties.78. Casualties for the week ending 0600 hours, the 14th May, are estimatedat 2,055 killed and 2,685 seriously injured.

On the 7th/18th April a bomb &quot; of tremendous power &quot; fell inan open space between the Bredscheider Strasse and the Rognitz Strasse(Charlottenburg area). The two nearest houses were razed to the ground andthe interior and windows of all houses within a radius of 500 yards were ruined.The blast effect was such that some of the soldiers quartered in the exhibitionbuildings nearby were found wandering aimlessly. On the 9th/10th April onecorner where the Mittelstrasse crosses the Friedrichstrasse was completelydemolished and many houses in the vicinity were rendered uninhabitable. Amilitary store was fired, and the bomb which fell on the Sans Souci palace causedserious damage to the interior. The &quot; Swiss House &quot; and the Graphic and printing Institute, modern buildings in the heart of Berlin, were both destroyed.Kiel. An informant who visited the town on the 17th April described it asa picture of destruction. He saw 136 houses in varying stages of ruin, and was told that from many of them bodies had not yet been recovered. A naval engineerstated that, while work on several vessels under construction had had to be suspended, the damage was not such as to cause total suspension on some of themfor more than 10 days. He was informed that the casualties were between 800and 1,000 and that there had been a considerable shortage of A.R.P. workers to alleviate the distress. In the raids on the 24th/25th and the 25th/26th Aprildomestic property suffered severely and the damage was considerable. casualties were high and two special trains were sent from Berlin with doctors and medicalequipment.Wilkelmshaven. In the raid on the 24th/25th April the Western Sectionof the port suffered most. It is said that approximately 25 per cent, of the houses in the port neighbourhood have been rendered uninhabitable.Brest. Several reports have been received of varying degrees of reliabilitywhich are unanimous in stating that both the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenauhave been hit. One source, believed reliable, states that the Gneisenau receivedthree direct hits on the night of the 10th/11th April, when over 100 of her crew were killed, and a further direct hit on the night 12th/13th. She is said tohave her forward turret out of alignment and the armoured deck behind thisturret is broken up. He personally observed two tugs working pumps lyingalongside the Scharnhorst, which was down by the stern. It is said that theGneisenau may be out of commission for at least three months. On the 27th/28thApril a patrol vessel in the harbour was severely damaged and photographs taken on the 8th May, while not enabling the actual damage to the battle cruisers to be assessed, confirmed the success of the attack on the night of the 7th/8th.

It is thought that the general store and drawing office of the ship-building yard Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire was also hit.Cherbourg.-Or\ the 10th/ 11th March a tanker was hit and it is thoughtwill be a total loss.Calais.
