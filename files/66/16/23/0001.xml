naval SITUATION.General.Enemy air raids by night on west coast ports have caused serious shippingcasualties.   A number of His Majesty&apos;s Ships have also been damaged.Our aircraft and submarines have successfully attacked enemy shipping inthe Mediterranean.An armed merchant raider has been sunk in the Indian Ocean.Home Waters.Throughout the week, cruiser patrols have been maintained in the Iceland-, Faroes channel and in the Denmark Strait.On the 6th May, H.M.S. Camito (Ocean Boarding Vessel), and the ItalianTanker Sangro (intercepted on the 1st May) were torpedoed and sunk in theNorth-Western Approaches.In air attacks during the week, H.M. Minesweeper Selkirk and H.M.Destroyer Southdown were damaged off the east coast. The latter shot down anenemy aircraft.During the week air raids on our ports have caused damage to H.M. ships and establishments. H.M.S. Sirius (6-inch cruiser, completing) was holed above the waterline at Portsmouth. The Naval Training Establishment was partially destroyed, H.M. Destroyers Hurricane and Viscount were seriously damaged and h.M. Minelayer Adventure and H.M.S. Maplin (fighter catapult ship) slightly damaged during raids on Liverpool. H.M.S. Furious sustained damage to. the hangar, H.M. Corvettes Buttercup (completing) and La Malouine were seriously damaged and H.M.S. Pegasus (fighter catapult ship) slightly damagedat Belfast. Some naval stores, paravane equipment and all anti-submarinestores were also destroyed. One rating was killed, and one officer and fiveratings wounded. H.M. Destroyers Whaddon and Vivacious and a minesweeperdrifter were slightly damaged, and the base offices were destroyed at Hull. a parachute mine, which dropped in the Waveney Dock at Lowestoft. sank a mine-sweeping trawler and damaged another. On the Clyde, the Boom DefenceBarracks at Greenock were demolished and four ratings killed.2. During the week, Blenheim aircraft from Bomber Command have sunkone 2,000-ton enemy merchant ship and four trawlers in the Dover Straits and offthe Dutch Coast. Three ships, two of 5,000 tons and one of 1,500 tons, were seriously damaged. A Blenheim from Coastal Command damaged a 3,000-ton ship off the Norwegian coast.North Atlantic.3. On the 1st May H.M.S. Loch Oskaig (Armed Boarding Vessel) interceptedthe French s.s. Cap Cantin (3,317 tons) on passage from Bayonne to Casablancaand sent her in to Gibraltar.On the 3rd May H.M.S. Hilary (Ocean Boarding Vessel) intercepted and sank the Italian tanker Recco (5,598 tons) loaded with fuel oil for Brest in aposition 350 miles north of the Azores. The captain, 8 officers and 21 men were taken prisoner.Mediterranean.4. The latest estimate of total numbers embarked from Greece is 51,640,of which 500 were lost at sea. Salvage operations on H.M.S. York at Suda Bayhave been suspended due to air raids and only a maintenance party have been lefton board. During a dive-bombing attack on the 4th May, one merchant ship was damaged and subsequently beached.H.M. Gunboat Aphis bombarded the Sollum area on the night of the 1st/2ndMay. Two destroyers transported troops to Mersa/Tobruk on the night of the3rd/4th May and returned to Alexandria with 500 personnel. Heavy air attacks on Tobruk continue. H.M. Minesweeper Stoke was sunk and the British hospital ship Karapara was bombed and set on fire, but was able to reach Alexandria onthe 6th.
5. During an air raid on Malta on tlhe 30th April considerable damage was done in the dockyard, and ELM. Destroyer Encounter and H.M. MinesweeperFermoy received further damage. H.M. Destroyer Jersey was sunk by a mine inthe entrance to the Grand Harbour on the 2nd May.6. Off the coast of Tunis, HM. Submarine Upholder sank three northboundenemy merchant vessels, east of the Kerkenah Channel. She also surveyed thewreckage of the enemy convoy destroyed on.  he 16th March. One of these shipswas boarded and found to contain a cargo of motor cycles, cars and lorries. Theship was subsequently set on fire. During the week Blenheim aircraft haveattacked three enemy convoys escorted by destroyers. One ship and one destroyerwere sunk and one destroyer and five ships were damaged.HM. Submarine Taku, operating north of Sicily, reported that she had sunkan enemy transport.7. H.M.S. Gloucester was bombed and damaged while on passage from malta to Gibraltar.During the week four French merchant ships westbound and five eastboundhave passed Gibraltar, under escort.East Indies.8. On the 2nd May H.M. Ships in the Persian Gulf were instructed to commence hostilities against the Iraq forces.On the 8th May H.M.S. Cornwall reported that she had sunk an armed merchant raider about 600 miles north-east of the Seychelles. During the engagement Cornwall sustained slight damage and three minor casualties from two hits. Twenty-seven British and fifty-three German survivors from the raiderwere rescued. On the previous day a British tanker on passage to the persian gulf reported that she was being shelled by a raider in this vicinity.Anti-Submarine Operations.9. On the 5th May H.M. Corvette Verbena made a promising attack on aU-Boat south of Iceland, and on the same day the escort of a homebound convoymade a number of attacks on a contact in this area. Three attacks by aircraft,have been made in the North-Western Approaches without definite results. the master of the s.s. Empire Storm claims to have hit and sunk a U-Boat in a position250 miles west of Ireland on the 21st April. On the 22nd February s.s. La Pampapassed over the position where a U-Boat had just submerged. An examination of.the ship&apos;s bottom shows a long score running half the length of the ship.Delayed reports have also been received from the Mediterranean that on.the 18th March HM. Australian Destroyer Vendetta carried out a series of attacks when south-west of the island of Zea in the ^aegean, bringing oil andbubbles to the surface. A Sunderland also dropped depth charges and bombs.On the 30th April H.M. Destroyers Jaguar and Juno attacked a U-Boat withpromising results in a position 150 miles north-west of Alexandria.Enemy Intelligence.German.10. The 8-inch Cruiser Seydlitz was seen at Bremen on the 2nd May. Anincomplete photographic reconnaissance of Kiel on the following day showedone 8-inch cruiser and the Admiral Scheer present, but the other 8-inch cruiserwas not in the area covered by photographs.Unconfirmed reports state that the new battleship Bismarck was at Gdynia,on the 27th April, and that her sister ship, Tirpitz, had left that port on the^27th April, probably for trials. The 6-inch Cruiser Emden and another cruiser,,believed to be the Nurnberg, left Danzig on the 23rd April, probably for exercises-Similar reports place the Pocket Battleship Lutzow and three destroyers on the2nd May at Swinemunde, and state that the Cruiser Koln left that port on the28th April.The battle-cruisers at Brest are reported to have been hit again on the night of the 7th/8th May.   These ships have been elaborately camouflaged.   Nets havebeen spread between Gneisenau and the walls of the dock, so that this dock, unlike[22493] c
its neighbour, is only distinguishable from the surrounding buildings with difficulty. Scharnhorst has been made to appear &quot; built on &quot; to the quay so thatshe looks like an extension of the quay itself.Italian.11. Four of the Italian battleships have now been located. A photographic reconnaissance at Taranto on the 7th May showed one Littorio class battleshipin the outer harbour and the second in the inner harbour in dock. Three cruisers,probably 6-inch, 4 destroyers and 4 torpedo boats were also present. information has been received that 2 Cavour class battleships are now at Naples.U-boats.12. There have been ten or more German U-boats at work in the North-Western Approaches during the period under review, and some five or six Italiansdisposed mainly to the south of them. Three Germans have been active off the african coast and in the Cape Verde area. There has been one German presentoff the coast of Brazil.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.Note. In future the weekly information concerning British and Alliedmerchant ship-ping losses wilt be confined to giving a general indication of the enemy&apos;s attack. Appendices I, II and III will only be includedmonthly.&apos; 13. During the week under review, apart from serious shipping casualties during air raids on Liverpool and Belfast, losses at sea, primarily due to U-Boats,have been on a moderate scale. Shipping has been attacked by a U-Boat far outin the South Atlantic to the westward of Freetown, but no concerted U-boat attackhas been made on a convoy in the North-Western Approaches. Aircraft haveattacked shipping in the Bristol Channel and convoys on the East Coast have been bombed on four days in the week.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the week ended noon, the 7th May, 748 ships, including 132Allied and 17 neutral, were convoyed. Four battleships, 3 cruisers, 8 armed merchant cruisers, 3 submarines, 74 destroyers and 59 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties. Since the beginning of the war, 62,635 ships havebeen convoyed, of which 316 have been lost by enemy action.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ended the3rd May totalled 557,968 tons, compared with 796,426 tons during the previousweek, and an average of 663,114 tons during the past ten weeks. Fourteentankers brought in 171,809 tons of oil. Mineral imports were 123,180 tons, timber9,582 tons, and cereals 97,566 tons.  Other food imports amounted to 106,405 tons.British Minelaying.15. During the week, 1,500 mines have been laid in the Iceland-Faroeschannels, and 270 in the East Coast Barrier. Minelaying by aircraft has beencarried out off the French Atlantic ports, the French channel ports and, on a smaller scale, off Tripoli in the Mediterranean.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.16. Minelaying by aircraft has occurred off most of the east coast and the westcoast as far north as the Clyde and Belfast during the week. Liverpool has hadalmost nightly visits, during which mines have, been dropped in the docks andbasins. Several German explosive conical floats have been reported ashore betweenDover and the N. Foreland since the 27th April, and this seems to confirm the existence of a new minefield to the E. or N.E. of the Downs. Searching sweepshave been carried out in this area with negative results, but five explosive floats
and two mines, all floating, have been sunk off the Downs. A magnetic mine hasalso been detonated in the Downs, and is the first one in that area since last July.In all, 31 mines have been detonated in Home Waters during the week, andthe mine totals are now : acoustic 592, magnetic 1,110, contact 863. progress has been made with the scheme for installing 57 concrete mine-watching positions on the banks of the Thames and in the London Docks and on the bridges. It isestimated that some 415 men will be required for these mine-watching activities.Foreign Waters.17.   Enemy aircraft minelaying has taken place at Alexandria on two -occasions, and sweeping has been concentrated on clearing the Channel for themain units of the Fleet.   In all five mines have been detonated.On the 8th May the Suez Canal from Port Said to Kantara was closed dueto mines.A succession of minelaying raids have been experienced at Malta.During sweeping operations off Cape Ottway, in the Bass Straits, Australia,two mines were cut on the 30th April.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.18. It is reported that, since the 1st January, sixteen ore ships have leftNarvik, and that three ore trains reach the Lofoten railway daily.There are indications that those ships which have been engaged in the fruittrade between Spain and Italy may now be used regularly for carrying ore.The Ernst Hugo Stinnes 11 (3,295 tons) and the Else Hugo Stinnes 15(3,291 tons) are reported to be sailing to Gothenburg for conversion to salvageships for use in Norwegian waters.Italian.19. From the captured Port Records at Benghazi, dated the 30th January, itis known that the Maria Eagenia (4,702 tons), was sunk in the harbour before theBritish occupation on the 7th February, and that the Gloriastella (5,490 tons)and the Snia Amba (2,532 tons) were damaged at the same time.The three tankers, Arcola (6,349 tons), Taigete (4,672 tons) and Toolaro(5,162 tons) were reported on the 5th May to be making preparations for depar-ture from Teneriffe.Economic Warfare.20. During the months of March and April, 4,470 tons of cargo destined for the enemy were seized in prize. The main items were 2,183 tons of oilseeds,mostly from French ships, 821 tons of metals, 428 tons of gums and resins, and362 tons of fats and oils. The total seizures since the beginning of the waramount to 781,211 tons.MILITARY SITUATION.Balkan Operations.21. Except for small detachments the evacuation of our forces from Greecewas completed by the 30th April. Approximately 80 per cent, of the troopsengaged were evacuated. Of the remainder about 3,000 were casualties and about,000 missing.On the 2nd May the German communique claimed that the entire Peloponnesewas in German hands, and on the same day a victory parade was held in Athens.Crete.22. From various reports it appears possible that the Germans are considering the staging of a combined operation for the capture of Crete.
.... &apos;   Major-General B. C. Freyberg, V.C., C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., LL.D., is now in(, command of all forces in Crete, including, at the special request of the GreekGovernment, any Greek forces that reached the island.   Full details of these arenot yet available.   There were, however, 3 battalions in Crete at the time of thearmistice, as well as a considerable number of partially trained recruits.Turkey.23.   Preparations to withstand a possible attack from Bulgaria and Greeceappear to be well in hand.   The construction of field defences along the Asiaticcoasts of the Bosphorus, Marmara and Dardanelles is progressing.   Permanent. coastal defences and batteries near the northern end of the first and the southernii end of the last will form a part of these defences, since their field of fire is not limited to the sea alone.   Troops have also been disposed to resist landings by air borne troops, and A.A. batteries have been moved in order to defend vital, centres in Asia Minor, such as the Karabuk steel works and the munitions factory at Kocuk Yozgat.Roumania..&apos;        24.   Crude oil production for 1940 was 8-14 per cent, less than for 1939.Libya and Egypt.25. Tobruk. On the night of the 30th April/1st May the enemy attacked and penetrated our defences on the south-west perimeter, and on the morning of the 1st May 30 tanks attacked towards Pilastrino. Our forward line ofdefended localities on a 5,000-yard front was captured, and approximately60 enemy tanks avoided gun positions and concentrated on our infantry forwardposts. Our tanks counter-attacked and a portion of the enemy withdrew afterlosing 11 tanks. Enemy aircraft made numerous dive-bombing attacks on our troops and artillery positions. On the evening of the 1st May, owing to theenemy tank action, a counter-attack did not succeed in restoring the whole of our forward line of defended localities. On the morning of the 2nd May 30 enemymedium tanks, followed by two companies of infantry, advanced against our new line, but were stopped by artillery fire. A further counter-attack by our troops on the night of the 3rd / 4th May was not successful owing to the bold use by the enemy of tanks, machine guns and flame-throwers. Severe casualties are,however, believed to have been inflicted upon the enemy.26. Sollum. Our patrols have been active in the Sollum area, and on the night of the 30th April/1st May a raiding party mined the road Capuzzo-El Adem at Sidi Azeiz and also ambushed enemy troops on the Bardia-Tobrukroad.East Africa.27. Our forces have captured Bahrdar, which is at the southern end of lake Tana, and our force, moving northwards from Dessye, has repaired theroad demolitions and has continued to advance. On the 5th May an ItalianGeneral and 170 Europeans were captured at Alomata, but north of this place a further road block was encountered.28. There are indications that the enemy in the Sciasciamanna area arewithdrawing.29.   The Emperor entered Addis Ababa on the 5th May.Iraq.30. Area Habbaniya. As a result of the occupation of the high groundsurrounding Habbaniya cantonment by considerable numbers of Iraqi troops, thesituation became so critical that it was decided, instead of sending an ultimatum to the Iraqi Commander, that our forces should take offensive action at 0500 hourson the 2nd May. At 0200 hours the same morning the Iraqis began shelling thecantonment and caused casualties to personnel and aircraft.
31.   The land forces at Habbaniya consisted of 400 all ranks of the King&apos;s Own Royal Regiment, which had beenflown from India (reinforced by a further 150 all ranks whoarrived on the 4th May).1,250 Iraq levies. ) x* a ttr! v j ? R.A.11. units.One squadron armoured cars, j 32. Since the action began our air forces have continuously attacked theenemy positions, the effect of which has been to keep the Iraqi shelling to aminimum.33. During the night of the 5th May the Iraqi forces withdrew from thehigh ground and retired in the direction of Fallujah pursued by our troops, whoinflicted heavy casualties. As a result of this, the situation has improved andthere seems to be no immediate threat to the cantonment.34. Area Basra. On hearing of the outbreak of hostilities at Habbaniya,General Fraser, commanding the Indian forces at Basra, occupied Basra airport,the dock area and the power station. He demanded the withdrawal of Iraqitroops from these areas by a certain time. In spite of an extension of time, thedemand was not complied with, and General Fraser ordered air action and artillery action against the Iraqi forces. They then withdrew and have since notbeen in contact with our forces.35. Owing to the smallness of his force, General Fraser has not been ableto occupy the town of Basra, the inhabitants of which are reported as being non-co-operative, hostile and imbued with anti-British propaganda.36. A further reinforcement of one infantry brigade of three battalionsarrived at Basra on the 6th May, passing up the Shatt-el-Arab unopposed.37. On the 3rd May Iraqi forces occupied Rutbah (on the pipe-line, 75 miles east of the Trans Jordan frontier).38. C.-in-C, Middle East, assumed command of land operations in NorthernIraq at noon, the 5th May.Enemy Activities and possible intentions.Invasion of United Kingdom.39. The construction and collection of invasion craft continues, but thereis evidence that many of the types reported are still in the experimental stage.There have been fewer reports of embarkation exercises of late. June to september is the period now spoken of as likely for invasion. Military materialcontinues to arrive in coastal areas, but some of it is believed to be of a defensivenature.40. Movement of troops through Finland northwards to the number of some4,500 is confirmed, and there have been several indications of sea and rail traffic between Germany and the North of Norway, in particular to Kirkenes, where thenumber of German troops is being increased and where an assembly of shipping is said to be taking place.This may indicate German anxiety to ensure the safety of the Petsamo nickelmines or, as reported from one source, an attack on Iceland. Alternatively, it.may form part of the &quot; pressure politics &quot; now being used against Russia.Roumania.41. It is reliably reported that Roumanian troops have been withdrawn and civilians evacuated from the region of the Soviet frontier in order to make room for German troops. In the event of hostilities, it is stated, the Roumanianarmy would occupy Bessarabia after it had been conquered by Germany and holdit while the German advance continued.Norway.[22493]n
Turkey.42. There are reports that Germany will force Turkey to permit passageof troops by bribes of territory (Syria and Dedeagatch); that &quot; business men,&quot;active in Sofia before Bulgaria&apos;s accession to the Tripartite Pact, are in Turkey,and that Germany will by-pass Turkey. She has already seized some of theGreek islands.Iraq and Syria.43. There are no indications as to whether Germany will answer the appeal for help which is alleged to have been made by Iraq, but it is reported that theGermans are trying to secure the use of intermediate landing grounds in Syria,and to prepare for the arrival of parachute troops. This would also enable her to put stronger pressure on Turkey.Spain,44. Reports suggest that the Germans are considering an attack onGibraltar, either by their own or by Spanish Porces, of which the timing may be dependant on the Spanish attitude and on the outcome of the Libyan operations.The Germans are likely to take into consideration the value of allowing the earlyharvest to be completed (about mid-June) without disturbance.Reports of activity include A.A. artillery and aeroplane parts of Germanorigin sent to Spain and German bombs to the Canary Islands; also Germanexperts on aerodromes and at gun positions in Southern Spain.There is little doubt that the Axis Powers, aided by Sefior Suner, are puttingincreasing pressure on Pranco to join them, but, on the other hand, there arestrong elements urging Franco to maintain neutrality as long as possible.Portugal.45. The Portuguese authorities are said to have been warned that a german attack is likely as soon as the Balkan campaign has been concluded, and a sourcedescribed as reliable states that the Germans have planned and rehearsed a landing in Portugal by a seaborne expedition from French Biscay ports.Morocco.46. German officers are reported to have inspected aerodromes in spanish morocco, and it is believed that Germans have entirely replaced the ItalianArmistice Commission in French Morocco.Italy.47. A number of reports have been received that Italian troops havereplaced Germans in Occupied France (mainly in the central and northern areas),but no units have been identified.Many thousands of Italian workmen have recently been sent to Germany,and some reports put the total number to be sent as high as 300,000. This would seriously affect Italian reserves of man-power and material resources, and itseems therefore probable that the Italian Army is likely to be allotted a humblerole in the development of Axis operations.AIR SITUATION.General Review.48. Successful attacks were made on the Gneisenau and Scharnhorst;Hamburg, Cologne, and Mannheim were heavily bombed. Our aircraft carriedout many successful attacks against enemy Coastal shipping and also scored hitson enemy convoys in the Mediterranean.The enemy&apos;s main raids were directed against the Merseyside; the Clyde andTyne areas were also heavily attacked. Our night fighters have been increasinglysuccessful. The Royal Air Force cantonment at Habbaniya was successfullydefended, after being invested by Iraqi troops.
Germany and Occupied Territory.49. During the week, Bomber Command flew 139 day and 836 night sorties;compared with the previous week the scale of day operations was reduced, butnight operations show a marked increase. Coastal Command have supported the night operations, particularly by a series of attacks on Brest and St. Nazaire.Day.50. The majority of daylight attacks was again directed against enemycoastal shipping, details of which will be found under Coastal Operations. Onthe 1st May, ten Blenheims attacked the submarine base at Den Helder, andscored direct hits on a Power House, a large warehouse and a hotel and alsoprobably hit the lock gates and barracks. Another Blenheim bombed Rotterdampetrol stores from a low altitude.Night.51. Bomber Command aircraft operated on six nights during- the week, witha nightly average of nearly 140 sorties; on each occasion a major attack was delivered on one selected objective. Although there was a good moon throughoutthe week, with the exception of the three attacks on the Scharnhorst andGneisenau at Brest, visibility over targets was considerably hampered by cloud.In these three attacks a total of 290 tons of H.E. bombs were dropped, which included 109 2,000 lb. AP. bombs. Some of our aircraft came down to a few thousand feet and, in one attack, a direct hit was claimed on one of the battle-cruisers with a 500 lb. S.A.P. bomb, while two other crews were confident of having scored direct bits on the same ship. In the third and largest attack it is claimed that each battle-cruiser was hit with one 2,000 lb. bomb and one 500 lb.bomb, whilst numerous near misses almost certainly caused further damage.Large fires were also observed in other parts of the dock area.52. The shipping and industrial areas of Hamburg were the principaltarget on two nights; large fires were started in the industrial area, the burstsof the 2,000 lb. and 4,000 lb. bombs being particularly violent. It was noticeable,however, that fires were more promptly dealt with than on previous occasions.Cologne industrial centre was the main target in the night the 3rd/4th May;seventy-two aircraft carried out the attack, in most cases dropping their bombsthrough gaps in the clouds; many large fires were reported especially on theEast Bank of the River. The industrial district of Mannheim was bombed two nights later by one hundred and twenty-three bombers, including four Stirlingsand four Manchesters. Visibility was poor, however, and it is thought that the damage, though severe, was not concentrated.53. Lighter attacks were made on Rotterdam, St. Nazaire, Emden, Frank-further, Havre, Bremen and on the majority of the Channel Ports. During allthese night operations only five of our bombers were missing.54. Coastal Command Blenheims made small attacks on the battle-cruisersat Brest and on the submarine bases at St. Nazaire and Lorient. Four Blenheimsattacked the Pechelbronn oil refinery near St. Nazaire, as a result of which achimney was tossed into the air and fires were visible at a distance of 100 miles.Other attacks were made on Egersund, on oil tanks at Lagmandsholm, and onSola and Forus aerodromes in Norway.55. On six nights, Fighter Command carried out offensive patrols overNorthern France. Bombs were successfully dropped on a number of aerodromes,in addition to which seven enemy aircraft were shot down, three more probably destroyed, and six others damaged.United Kingdom.56. Fighter Command flew 1,158 patrols, involving 2,796 sorties, by day,and 2,987 sorties were also flown by night. Enemy activity by day was roughlythe same as during the previous week, but, by night, 1,870 bomber-sorties were flown as compared with 620.
57. By day, the usual coastal and weather reconnaissances were flown, and fighter patrols were maintained in the Straits and over the Pas de Calais area.Each day a few of these patrols flew in over Kent, but on the 7th they came overin greater numbers and our fighters shot down eight and probably destroyed or damaged another ten, for the loss of two Spitfires and their pilots.58. The Liverpool area was attacked on all nights of the week except the night 5th/6th May, when the main concentration was directed against Clydesideand Northern Ireland. The moon-period, however, was used for widespreadattacks, which extended, among other places, to Bristol, Barrow, the Midlands,North-East Coastal towns and East Anglia.59. Our night fighters were extremely active and successful; 58 enemy aircraft were destroyed, 14 probably destroyed, and a further 29 damaged. A.A.guns brought down a further ten bombers.Coastal Operations.60. Coastal Command flew 273 patrols and, in addition, provided escort for129 convoys involving 933 sorties. Aircraft of Fighter Command also flew 2,609sorties on shipping protection patrols.Bomber Command Blenheims continued their search for enemy shipping, butvessels of large tonnage were difficult to locate; some big convoys were, however,sighted at night. Attacks were pressed home from very low altitudes, and on one occasion an aircraft struck the mast of the ship, but succeeded in returning.All the vessels attacked were also subjected to heavy machine-gun fire. direct hits were made on the following : 5,000-ton M.V. off Boulogne : Severely damaged and possibly sunk.2,000-ton M.V. off Gravelines : Three direct hits.500-ton Trawler off Gravelines : Total loss.500-ton Trawler N.W. of Juist: Set on fire.   Total loss.500-ton Trawler N.W. of Juist: No trace after attack.1,500-ton M.V. off Neuzen : Severely damaged.5,000-ton M.V. off Ameland : Damaged.100-ton Trawler off Texel: Sunk.50-ton Vessel off Texel: Probably total loss.At least six other vessels were missed by very small margins, and were probably damaged; one bomb caused a large spout of water from under the starboard keelof a 5,000-ton tanker, causing it to heel over.61. A Coastal Command Blenheim scored at least one direct hit on a3,000-ton vessel off the Norwegian Coast, and a merchant vessel at Bergen wasalso believed to have been hit. Two Focke Wulf aircraft were hit in engagements,one by a Hudson and one by a Catalina.62. Twenty-four successful minelaying sorties were flown by bomber command and twenty-one by Coastal Command. Enemy minelaying aircraft operated on a reduced scale but covered the usual areas; some aircraft normallyengaged in minelaying took part in night bombing operations.Greece and Eastern Mediterranean.63. By the 30th April, the evacuation of our forces from Greece was com-pleted, and our aircraft were engaged in escorting naval units to Suda Bay.64. On five days the enemy made reconnaissances of Crete, and theanchorage at Suda Bay was bombed on two occasions. On the 3rd May, thirtyhostile aircraft dive-bombed the anchorage and damaged a ship. Our fighters and A.A. guns destroyed four aircraft, probably destroyed four and damagedfour. On the 4th May sixteen bombers repeated the attack on Suda Bay withlimited success.65. Two Wellingtons bombed Calato aerodrome, in Bhodes, on the night4th/5th May and started four fires. During the week one or more unidentifiedaircraft made a reconnaissance of the Palestine coast.
Malta.

66. The Island was attacked on five days during the week. The Grand Harbour, the dockyard, the town of Valletta and Luqa aerodrome were the main objectives. Two of the attacks met with little success, but, on the nights of the 30th/1st and 3rd/4th, considerable damage was done to the dockyards, stores and wharves. Civilian, military and naval property also suffered. A.A. fire destroyed two bombers and damaged a third. At Luqa aerodrome two fighters were destroyed on the ground and two damaged.

67. On the 1st May, six Blenheims attacked an enemy convoy with torpedo-boat escort south-east of Kerkenah Island. The destroyer and a 3,000-ton M.V. were hit; an aircraft on patrol on the 2nd May reported these two ships as sunk.

On the 2nd May, four Blenheims attacked another convoy in the same area. The convoy consisted of six M.Vs. (2,000 to 8,000 tons) and two destroyers. Three of the M.Vs. and one destroyer were hit, and stopped.

On the 7th, five Blenheims and three Beaufighters attacked an enemy convoy of eight M.Vs. and two escorts 65 miles south-south-east of Pantellaria. Two M.Vs. were hit and left listing badly, while a third ship was probably hit.

Egypt and Libya.

68. On six nights, Wellingtons bombed the harbour at Benghazi and the landing grounds at Berca, Benina, Derna, Gazala and Bardia. At Benghazi, an ammunition dump was destroyed and a ship set on fire. Many violent explosions also took place when hits were made on the quays and dock-buildings. At Benina landing ground, fires and explosions were caused, and at least five aircraft, including two Focke-Wulf troop-carriers, were destroyed on the ground. A hangar at Berca was set alight. Blenheims and Hurricanes attacked many small convoys between El Adem and Halfaya and machine-gunned sixty M.T. vehicles south-west of Apollonia. Blenheims also made many reconnaissances and bombed M.T. vehicles at El Adem, Bardia, Sollum and Capuzzo.

69. On the 1st May, following the enemy penetration of the perimeter of the Tobruk defences, Hurricanes patrolled over Tobruk to protect the land forces against heavy dive-bombing attacks with fighter escorts. Four enemy fighters were shot down and one of our Hurricanes was destroyed. These heavy enemy air attacks caused casualties and damage to our guns and tanks. On the 4th May, thirty enemy bombers attacked the west landing ground at Tobruk. Some transport and equipment was damaged by splinters, but a similar attack on the following day caused no damage or casualties.

East Africa.

70. Aircraft of all types continued to support our land forces proceeding south near Amba Alagi towards Quoran, to meet our columns advancing northwards from Dessye. Troops, transport and stores dumps in the Falaga Pass were repeatedly bombed and machine-gunned by Wellesleys, Lysanders, Hardys and Gladiators. South African Ju. 86&apos;s and Hartebeestes assisted the forces engaged in the attacks around Sciasciamanna.

71. A German aircraft flew over the Dardanelles on the 2nd May and was engaged by Turkish A.A. guns. The Turks have concentrated two Hurricane squadrons at Yesilkoy, in Thrace, but have prepared for the speedy evacuation of the units to Anatolia.

Iraq.

72. On the 2nd May, at 0200 hours, the Royal Air Force Cantonment at Habbaniya was invested by Iraqi troops and hostilities broke out. The aerodrome and emergency landing-ground were shelled, and 22 out of 29 serviceable aircraft were damaged. Our casualties were over 40, including four pilots and two observers. Iraqi aircraft unsuccessfully bombed and machine-gunned the camp.

73. On the same day, all available aircraft attacked the investing forces,and No. 4 Frying Training School carried out 400 sorties on this and the threesubsequent days, dropping approximately thirty tons of bombs. Aided by extraguns, the enemy shelling continued desultorily during this period, but without making it impossible for aircraft to use the landing-grounds, although a furthernumber were destroyed and damaged on the ground. Wellingtons from Shaibahbombed enemy troops and positions and attacked their aircraft at Raschid aero-drome. Blenheims did valuable reconnaissance of the pipe-line around Rutbah,where a large oil fire was observed, and also of the towns of Mosul, Kirkuk,Baghdad and Sulman Pak. On the 6th May, reconnaissance showed that theenemy positions near Habbaniya had been abandoned.74. During the operations, the greater part of the Iraqi Air Force was putout of action. We lost seven aircraft in the air and seven on the ground. It isprobable that the Iraqis expected air assistance from the Germans. Pilotsreturning to Habbaniya from Hit during the night of the 5th/6th May reportedthat fires were lighted at their approach and all along their route. Others werelighted round Habbaniya which had the appearance of guiding marks. An Arabquestioned at Hit thought that our aircraft were German.Air Intelligence.Italian Air Force.75. The Italian Air Force appears to be cast for a very minor role in future.The aircraft industry is being reorganised to meet German requirements, and thestrength of the Air Force will probably be progressively reduced.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.76. The only bombing incidents during daylight were at Weymouth,Margate, Lowestoft, in open country in Suffolk, and at the R.A.F. aerodromesof Lympne and Manston.Very few casualties resulted and damage was slight except at Weymouth,where the production of Whitehead Torpedo Co., Ltd., was temporarily stoppedby damage to buildings and machinery.By Night.77. Enemy bombing has been heavy and mainly directed against our principal ports and docks. Merseyside was raided every night of the week underreview, with Liverpool as the main centre of attack on four of these nights.Belfast was attacked on three successive nights. Clydeside, Tyneside, Portsmouthand Manchester were attacked on two nights. Raids were also made on Barrow-in-Furness, Bristol, Weymouth, Tees-side and the Humber ports.No bombs were dropped in London.Damage.Merseyside.78. The cumulative effect of seven successive nights&apos; bombing has not beenfully assessed, but it is known that extensive damage has been done to docks,railways, all utility services, and to private property.79. Heavy salvage operations are entailed by ships sunk in the docks, andin some cases dock gates are unusable owing to lack of electric power.80. The railway system to the docks was badly affected by actual damage and by unexploded bombs, and sections of the Dockyard Overhead Railways were destroyed. Many roads near the docks were blocked by craters or debris and inBootle two important bridges were smashed.81. Considerable damage by fire was done to dockyard buildings and the offices of the Mersey Dock and Harbour Board were destroyed.
Belfast.82. Damage to the docks was on a fairly large scale and included thedestruction of several sheds by fire. The harbour power station was hit and therewas considerable interference with utility services.83. Some damage was done to the works of Short and Harland, Ltd.. ,Harland and Wolff, Ltd., and to the harbour workshops. ;84.   Damage in the city itself was considerable and caused mainly by fire,private property being mainly affected. 1Clydeside.85. Bombing on Clydeside was scattered and, although some industrial concerns were affected, the principal damage was to railways, which caused traffic congestion in the dock areas.Elsewhere. ;86. Damage elsewhere has been confined mainly to private property and toutility services. In some cases temporary stoppages in production have resultedthrough loss of power.Casualties.87. Casualties for the week ending 0600 hours 7th May are estimated at,603 killed and 1,756 seriously injured. These figures include 850 killed in liverpool on the night of the 3rd/4th May.
