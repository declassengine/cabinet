THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1941.SECRET. Copy No. 2W.P. (41) 121.June 4, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.MEETING OF DOMINION PRIME MINISTERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IT appears from a recent telegram from Mr. Mackenzie King to the PrimeMinister that Mr. Menzies, during his recent visit to Canada, urged on Mr. Kingthe desirability of an early meeting of Dominion Prime Ministers in London.In the past, Mr. King has, as the Cabinet knows, been averse to such a meeting,as he has felt strongly that a Prime Ministers place in war time is in his own country. But he seems to have modified his views to the extent of saying that ifspecific points of very great importance required discussion and decision amongstthe various heads of the Governments he would be prepared to come. Thequestion therefore arises whether such a Conference should now be called and,if so, when. The Prime Minister, in his reply to Mr. King, suggested tentativelyv. the month of July. This month certainly has certain advantages, which theCabinet will no doubt wish to take fully into account.First, Mr. Fraser is due to arrive in this country early in June. He could probably be persuaded to stay on over the Conference, whereas if he once wentback to New Zealand it might be difficult for him, in existing circumstances, toreturn here. In view of the political situation in South Africa it would be difficult for General Smuts to be absent at any time for more than a short period, but asthe Union Parliament will not be sitting in July this month might be convenient for him. Finally, there is the general consideration that there has for some time been both here and in the Dominions a sporadic agitation for bringing dominion prime Ministers into personal consultation here, and it might, therefore, beexpected to have a stabilising effect on public opinion.On the other hand, there are likely to be considerable practical difficulties incollecting the Prime Ministers so soon. Mr. Menzies has only just arrived inAustralia, and would have to start back almost at once. /This is not, of course,an insuperable difficulty, for his public utterances since his return make it clearthat he is quite ready to come. But it may well be physically impossible for himto get here in time. There is also the question of Mr. Mackenzie King. Theattached telegram from Mr. Malcolm MacDonald emphasises the fact that though he is ready to come if he is urgently needed, he is not eager to do so unless somecompelling reason were forthcoming.The question, to my mind, largely turns upon the agenda for such a meeting.There will have to be at some time an Imperial Conference to discuss post-wararrangements generally. Certain aspects of this, e.g., future economic policy andthe disposal of surplus commodities, are already active and could possibly bediscussed with the Dominion Prime Ministers at this stage. But it can hardly be said that the time has yet come for a general Conference with them on these issues, and it would seem that in July, when we are likely still to be in the throes[22584]
of battle and when the future will almost inevitably be doubtful and obscure,such discussions could hardly be other than inconclusive, and once the conference had been held we should have to wait some time before we could call another.It is doubtful, moreover, whether Mr. Mackenzie King and General Smuts atany rate would be willing to leave their countries in July for a conference of this general nature.If, on the other hand, the intention is to invite the Dominion PrimeMinisters to take part in a Conference primarily called to discuss the generalconduct of the war in its fullest strategic and other aspects, I believe that the response to the invitation is much more likely to be favourable in every case.The situation as it is at present developing might well make July a suitable time for such a meeting, and, for the reasons indicated above, July should not present insuperable difficulty for the four Dominion Prime Ministers. It would of course have to be understood that the meeting would be a short one.I do not know how my colleagues would view the idea of a meeting withsuch an agenda. If they should be in favour of it, the sooner the Conference is called, the better. If, on the contrary, the purpose of the meeting were to be toconsider the future generally, I suggest that it would be better later in the year.In any case, I propose that an invitation might be sent to General Smuts to visitthis country at an early date. He has not been here since the outbreak of war,and, as I have explained above, the time should be convenient to him. His advicewould be of the utmost value, not only with regard to the future but also thepresent, and no doubt he would be willing to return here later if the situationmade a general Conference of Dominion Prime Ministers desirable.C.June 4, 1941.
ANNEX.(No. 766.   Most Secret and Personal.)MACKENZIE KING tells me that he received a telegram from Mr. Churchilla short while ago suggesting the possibility of a gathering of the Prime ministers in London some time during the Summer.&apos; Mr. King is now drafting a statementof his own attitude, which he will probably send to Massey for Massey&apos;s commentsfirst, and for the High Commissioner to hand to the Prime Minister afterwards.The following is a summary of Mr. King&apos;s attitude. He is averse to leavingCanada at any time in the early future, mainly for the following reasons : First, he assumes that his presence here is of great importance from thepoint of view of maintaining Canadian unity in the war effort. If he were to goto London, Lapointe would become the Acting Prime Minister, and this would lead to difficulty with those political elements in Canada who are suspicious ofthe French Canadians in general, and even to some extent of Lapointe inparticular. The latent controversy between those who favour immediate intro-duction of conscription for overseas service and those who are averse to this because of the serious reaction it would have in French Canada would be aggra-vated. The controversy is already becoming a matter of public discussion, and unless carefully handled might easily lead to a serious.rift. If the Prime minister were absent when this issue became acute, it might do serious damage, and thereare people who would be inclined to take advantage of his absence to force theissue. In the Prime Ministers own view, this would almost certainly lead to &amp;split in his own Cabinet, which might end in many of his own colleagues, including all the French Canadians, resigning; and it would also lead to a bad split, in thecountry.Second, if the United States of America comes into the war, he thinks thathe should be here to conduct Canadian-American relations from the Canadianend. Certain questions would immediately arise, e.g., the military command onthe North American coasts, which he would wish to handle himself. his experience and authority, which are so much greater than those of any of hiscolleagues, and his friendship with President Roosevelt would enable many diffi-culties to be overcome which might otherwise lead to unfortunate friction.Third, if Japan comes into the war, it would also raise questions in WesternCanada which would require his guidance as the head of the Government.There are other points which he may mention in his telegram to the PrimeMinister, but the above are the most important reasons why it is desirable thathe should stay in Canada.For these reasons he would not wish to come to London during the Summer,unless specific points of very great importance require discussion and decisionamongst the various heads of the Government. He feels that the time will comeat a later stage in the war when such discussions and decisions are necessary,and he is fully prepared to come then.He feels that the present method of communication and consultation betweenthe United Kingdom and the Dominion Governments is working excellently.They have no complaints whatever in Canada. He does not feel that any specialImperial Conference for the purpose of demonstrating the unity of the Common-wealth is required just now, as he feels that the whole world knows well thatunity and co-operation between us are complete. For these reasons he woulddefinitely oppose calling the conference now.My personal opinion is that there is great force in the three considerations set out above in favour of Mackenzie King staying in Canada at the presenttime. Of course, a situation may arise in which even more weighty considera-tions require his presence in London. When he showed me a first draft of the message which he proposes to send to Mr. Churchill via Massey, I urged him tostrengthen and make categorical his statement of his willingness to come toLondon whenever such an occasion arises.   He will do this.When the Government in London feels strongly that the time for theconference has arrived, a careful statement of the specific arguments for theconference in telegram from Mr. Churchill to Mackenzie King would carry great weight, and I feel sure I also could help to persuade him to come.
