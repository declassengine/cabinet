CONSCRIPTION IN NORTHERN  ireland note by the Inspector General of the RoyalU:.;&apos;:  Ulster Constabulary* * ; i.It is extremely doubtful if conscription has thewhole-hearted support of: either section of the population and&apos; there is considerable danger&apos; that it will drift into alocal political issue and the main fact be overlooked that once the Bill is passed each individual must obey the lawregardless of the attitude of his neighbour.It will fall more heavily upon the Roman- Catholic.&apos;section, than, the Protestant because a greater proportion ofthe latter are in reserved occupations, a fact which has     &quot;already, been&apos;exaggerated by Nationalist speakers.       ..Cardinal MacRory has pronounced strongly against...conscription in a press, interview, and his attitude, may betaken as that which will be adopted by his church.    Hestresses the local political issue of Partition and the denial of equal opportunity for Catholics with Protestantsin Northern Ireland.    The Nationalists are meeting to-day.The result of this meeting is not yet known though.it maysafely be assumed that it will follow the. lead of the cardinal.There has been no statement so far from Eire expressing the views of De Valera and his: Government.    It is, however,unlikely that he will come out in opposition to the churchand if any popular clamour, arises in the South he may wellplace himself at the head of &quot;it if for no other reason than to gain popularity......---.....With the church and the Nationalists, opposed to conscription active, organization to resist it will commenceat once in every parish and will not cease if a Bill is introduced, and passed into law..   Many will cross the Borderbut&apos; from those&apos; who remain, wide resistance to the. enforce-ment of the Act may be expected.    This in the first instancewill be demonstrated by failure to register.    It will thenbe necessary for the Police, to carry out arrests to whichresistance may be. expected-even down to the use of firearms.If this represents a fair forecast of the situationwhich will develop, it must be realized that conscription willgive new life to the I.R.A.  and will attract into its ranksmany who to-day are keeping well clear, of it.   . It willprovide, it with a. new strength and- prestige which may last .for a long while, after the War is over. . Further sectarianfeeling will be embittered on both sides which will increasethe risk of Protestants adopting the attitude that they.goonly if the Roman.Catholics are taken.Unless the Church and Nationalist attitude isalteredif not to actual support of the measure at least to non-opposition the Police will have a difficult and dangeroustask-   This they should.be able to handle if there is no attempt to rush too many classes at the one time and if aBill, is prepared on such, lines that on registration. a manbecomes a Militia man.    All registering voluntarily might bedealt with through the procedure laid down in the English
Act except that those medically unfit would have to hedischarged and those in reserved occupations released.   all who refused to register would &quot;be arrested and retained in custody until handed over to the. Military Authority ordischarged on medical&apos;or other grounds.    Any Court to dealwith those arrested should be a special Court with 1 R.M.The effect of these measures outside Northern Irelanddoes not come within the scope of this memorandum.    It is asweir to.point out, however,  that full use of press propagandawill be made and that every incident will ,bey.ma&apos;gnifted.   in places like Belfast incidents Will be staged&apos; &apos;and&quot; the ;&quot;PressGang1&apos; up the, Palls Road will get its full share of publicityboth on1the Street and in.the press...   -   1  . ;The obstruction and passive resistance of the unwillingconscripts may create a problem for the Military Authorities.They should not be left in Northern Ireland and they should &apos;be widely dispersed.There is; one further point ,which will require consideration which is the extent to which ConscientiousObjection to&apos;taking any Oath of allegiance or to serving the British&apos;King will be accepted as grounds for release.
