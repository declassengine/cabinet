(41) 85.May 23, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.LORD HANKEY&apos;S COMMITTEE ON PREVENTING OIL from reaching ENEMY POWERS.Seventh Report.WE submit herewith the Sixth Report* of Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd&apos;s Committeeon the German Oil Position, which includes a note by the Chairman and asummary of conclusions which we endorse.New factors which have arisen since the last report forwarded to theDefence Committee in January 1941 are as follows : (i) The Defence Committee&apos;s decision in principle of the 13th January lastin favour of attacks on German synthetic oil plants as a primary aim off our bomber forces could not be implemented. The decision was subject to &quot; impact of events,&quot; which proved unfavourable owingfirstly to bad weather and more recently to the need for concentrating on other targets of more immediate urgency. Actually the weight of bombs dropped (232 tons) against synthetic oil plants last quarterwas considerably less than in the &quot; invasion &quot; period July-September1940 (332 tons), and a little more than half that in the quarterOctober-December (397 tons). Further, the earlier attacks were lessdamaging than Ave had been led to think,(ii) Some compensation, however, may arise from the blocking of the Danube,which it is estimated may result in a reduction of 400,000-450,000 tonsin the enemy supplies of oil fuel from Roumania to Western Europebefore the river traffic from Roumania is restored to normal. This,however, is liable to be at least partially counter-balanced by the oil supplies which the Axis Powers may obtain by sea from Russian and roumanian ports via the iEgean (for which they have tanker tonnageamounting to perhaps 250,000 tons available),(iii) In other respects, the position, broadly, is as anticipated in our lastreport. If the loss of Roumanian oil referred to above is taken intoaccount, the statistical position will show an excess of demand oversupply during the six months April to October of nearly 400,000 tons,while the free reserve of oil supplies at the end of that period is likelyto be reduced to about 1 million tons, equivalent to one month&apos;sconsumption by the Axis Powers and the controlled territories. TheGerman situation is likely to remain at its worst for about twelvemonths from the 1st April, 1941, after which it should graduallyimprove.* Annex. f W.P. (41) 2.[22547]Copy No.
3. We invite attention especially to Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd&apos;s covering note, andthe conclusions on pages 5 and 6 of the attached report.4. In these circumstances, we recommend to the Defence Committee thefollowing immediate proposals, which arise from the report of Mr. GeoffreyLloyd&apos;s Committee : (a) Heavy bombing attacks during the next few months of German oil resources within reach, including the more accessible synthetic plants in Western Germany, especially the two Gelsenkirchen plants, so thattheir utility is effectively destroyed. In the Autumn, with longernights and increased resources, it may be possible to extend similarattacks to the^arger but more distant synthetic plants.(b) Attacks on the road transport system at key points.f     (c) Attacks by air and sea on tankers and sea transport generally.(d) Every possible effort to prevent use by the Axis Powers of the sea route through the Dardanelles and Eastern Mediterranean.(e) Careful watch on Germany&apos;s estimated reserves.5. We also wish to invite attention to the great importance we attach todenying the Axis Powers the use of oil supplies from Iraq, Iran and the Caucasus.While in our opinion the enemy is &quot;just holding his head above water with theexisting sources of supply in Europe, without some such additional source ofsupply or a considerable improvement in transport facilities, his position willremain precarious. Any further Aveakening should place a severe limitation onhis offensive operations.On behalf of the Committee :(Signed) HANKEY, Chairman.Great George Street, S. W. 1,May 23, 1941.

NOTE BY THE CHAIRMAN.I forward the 6th Report of the Committee on the Enemy Oil Position.2. The position seems, in general, to remain, as stated in the 5th Report,one which must cause the Axis Powers serious concern for the future, until theysucceed in increasing domestic production and imports.3. In the last Report, the view was expressed that the Axis position was sufficiently important and sufficiently weak to justify a heavy effort againststrategic points. For operational and other reasons that have been deemeddecisive, it has not, in the meantime, been possible to achieve an effective weightof attack.i. The present review of the position leads to the following mainconclusions: (a) that the enemy oil position is likely to be at its worst for several months to come, and, thereafter, unless effective action is taken, to showgradual improvement,(b) that important results might be achieved if effective attack on oil resources could be made by all available means within the next fewmonths,(c) that, even if the attack were limited in extent to important near targets in Germany and were supported by continual interference withRoumanian supplies, an extremely vulnerable situation might be created by the Autumn, when a more intensive scale of attack maybe possible.G. L.
COMMITTEE ON THE ENEMY OIL POSITION.SIXTH REPORT.Summary and Conclusions.The oil position in the area under control of the Axis Powers was lastreviewed in the 5th Report dated the 16th December, 1940, which covered theperiod from October, 1940, to September, 1941. The estimates in this report havenow been revised in the light of experience of the first half of that year and of fresh evidence as to the probable course of events in the second half. some measure of confirmation of previous estimates is afforded by a recent most secretsource (see Appendix III). The revised estimates are now set forth in detail in Appendix I in which corresponding figures of the 5th report are included forfacility of reference.  The principal points may be summarised as follows: (1) The estimated resources of the Axis Powers over the 12 months underreview are increased by about 800,000 tons, after allowing for loss of oil in storeand in transit.The main items in the increase are: (a) additional supplies which the Axis Forces in the Balkans are expectedto draw directly from Roumania, instead of by the usual Danube and rail routes to Italy and the West.(b) A revised estimate of the damage caused by air attack on syntheticplants. Reconsideration of the theoretical assessment of damage(Appendix II) has led to the reduction of the estimated percentageof production lost from 15 per cent, to between 5 and 10 per cent, forthe period May to October, 1940, and allowance has been made fora substantial decline in the weight of attack in recent months.(2) The estimated consumption by the Axis Powers and in occupied anddominated countries in the same period is 240,000 tons less than former estimates,owing mainly to reduced civil consumption in Italy as a result of recent economies.There is also a small net reduction in the consumption of the Armed Forces inwhich, however, the fall in Italian requirements is largely offset by increasedGerman demands.(3) Allowance has been made for: (a) Reduction of three-quarters of a million tons in the estimate of the stockswith which Italy entered the war.(b) A reduction of 400,000 tons in French stocks remaining after thedestruction effected during the retreat.(c) An increase in German stocks of 150,000 tons owing to larger importsfrom Russia during 1940 than were previously estimated.(d) The reduction of the allowance for stocks immobilised in transit orotherwise in Axis-controlled Europe from 2  to 2 million tons. Theexpression &quot; distribution minimum &quot; hitherto used is no longerapplicable since it cannot be said that, over the greater part of the occupied territory any system of distribution, properly speaking, existsexcept for the enemy&apos;s armed forces. As stocks, other than those heldby these forces are now virtually exhausted in the occupied anddominated area, the allowance for stocks in transit and otherwiseimmobilised should now be reduced to 2 million tons. In this figureaccount is taken of the wider area of operations in the Balkans and north Africa, where supplies must be sent and stocks maintained.(4) The effect of the foregoing changes is to put the margin of free stocksthroughout Axis-controlled Europe (excluding Roumanian stocks) at 1  million on the 1st April, 1941.  As estimated supplies and consumption for the next six
months approximately balance, the margin on the 1st October remains about thesame amount, subject to the factors mentioned in the two following paragraphs.(S) The Danube is believed to have been unnayigable since early April asa result of military action; and the railways may also have suffered damage(though of this there is no evidence) and must in any case be confused by thewar and by the changes due to German occupation. Furthermore, in so far asYugoslav irregulars are still resisting, railways may suffer further damage. the blocking of the Danube at this critical moment must have seriously impededGerman oil supplies, and, while it continues, all other aggravating factors mustbe far more effective than at any other time. Hence there are factors now operating which must be altering, adversely to Germany, the estimated situationsummarised above, though the full effect of these factors cannot yet be evaluated.(6) Before the end of the current period, however, two other factors mayhave begun to take effect in Germany&apos;s favour, namely, the improvement in rail transport due to German unified control, and, perhaps, some sea transport fromthe Black Sea, certainly to Salonica, and possibly to Italian and even French ports. The latter development, if on a large scale, would to a great extent solveGermany&apos;s oil transport problems, though it would affect her estimated supplies during the current period only by mobilising the free Roumanian stocks and any additional Russian supplies which she might be able to obtain.(7) In the 5th Report it was stated that the hydrogenation plants wouldbecome the main source of Aviation Spirit after existing stocks bad been exhausted, a position which had not then been reached. All captured samplesexamined so far are blends containing up to 50-80 per cent, of straight-run petroleum spirit, possibly of Roumanian origin or from pre-war reserves,indicating that the dependence on hydrogenation plants is not yet so great as was anticipated. These plants are, however, the largest potential source of aviation spirit and some hydro-petrol has been present in a large proportion ofthe fuels examined, except for a few months at the end of 1940.Conclusions.(1) Though the statistical position for the next six months, as shown inAppendix I, is rather more favourable to the Axis Powers than was estimated inthe 5th Report, yet the broad conclusion of that Report stands in that the positionis not, by any means, satisfactory enough to relieve those Powers from serious concern for the immediate future. According to the present estimates, supplyand demand over the 6 months April to October approximately balance, yet thefree reserve over this period at the maximum figure of \\ millions, which is equivalent to about 1^ months&apos; consumption, cannot be a source of confidence tothe Axis Powers. This view is expressed even more forcibly by a recent internalsource (Appendix III), which states that the general oil supply situation for theyear 1941 must be regarded as extremely serious.(2) The enemy oil position is likely to be at its worst during the 12 months from the 1st April, 1941, and thereafter, ignoring the possibility of increasedBritish action, to show gradual improvement. Hence this period is particularlysuitable for interference with Germany&apos;s oil resources.(3) If a serious interruption of Danube transport has taken place and is notrelieved, it is likely to cause a substantial reduction in the volume of Germany&apos;soil supplies during the next three months. This loss might be of the order of400,000 tons or even more. Any additional attack, either on oil production oron distribution, made at such a moment is likely to be particularly effective and,if on a substantial scale, might affect Germany&apos;s strategy for 1941 and perhap seven 1942.(4) It is understood that the Roumanian targets and most of the largersynthetic oil plants are, owing to the short nights, not within effective bombingrange during the next few months. None the less, we think that importantstrategic results would be achieved if an effective attack on oil resources could bemade by every available means, including attacks on the more accessible syntheticplants in Western Germany (with an annual production of nearly 900,000 tons.
half of which is accounted for by two plants), and on the rail transport system atkey points, and attacks by air and sea (including mines) on tankers and sea transport generally.Even if this action were limited to the destruction of the two Gelsenkirchenplants, supported by continual interference with Germany&apos;s communications with roumania, it would almost certainly create an extremely vulnerable situation bythe autumn when intensive attack on the more distant and the largest syntheticplants may be possible.(5) It is most important to prevent the free use by the Axis Powers of thesea route through the Dardanelles and the Eastern Mediterranean.(6) Germany&apos;s estimated reserves are now low relatively to the margin of error in her favour which our estimates may easily contain. Careful watchshould, therefore, be kept for signs that her position is, in fact, substantiallyworse than we have been able to assume in this Report.
Part I. GENERAL POSITION.Stocks.1. Germany.In the 5th Report, dated the 16th December, 1940, reference was made toan intimation from certain American oil companies that initial stocks in germany at the outbreak of war were considerably higher than the estimate given in ourearlier reports. The evidence upon which this opinion was based has not yetbeen received. In the meantime, all the evidence, collected from numerous sourcessince the beginning of the war, has been again reviewed. The latest evidence from an internal source, which is regarded as reliable, gives actual figures of stocks at the close of 1940 in the case of some products and indications regardingstocks of other products, from which a conclusion may reasonably be drawn that stocks in Germany are not likely to have been at that time in excess of If million tons, which is little more than the estimate adopted in the 5th Report, viz.,1 - 6 million tons, which should, in any case, be increased by 150,000 tons onaccount of the revised estimates for imports from Russia (see Imports, para-graph 2).2. France.In the 5th Report the stocks in France at the 1st October, 1940, were estimated at 1 - 4 million tons, but subsequent evidence shows that destruction of stocks during the retreat was on a larger scale than had been assumed. Thedestruction in the R.A.F. raids on installations in the Bordeaux area has proved to be over 100,000 tons, or about twice as great as that allowed for in the report.It is, therefore, now estimated that stocks on the 1st October did not exceed million tons, including any quantities captured by the Germans.On this basis, and allowing for the consumption by the French Fleet in metropolitan France (118,000 tons since the 1st July, 1940), stocks in France atthe 1st April, 1941, amounted to 575,000 tons, less any quantities which may havebeen removed to Germany. This includes about 220,000 tons of motor and aviation spirit, of which the Germans are believed to have appropriated for their own useat least 150,000 tons of aviation spirit, and about 280,000 tons of fuel oil, and recent eidence suggests that the figure may be much lower. The latter figure would be reduced by any bunkers taken by mercantile vessels from the unoccupiedzone. It is probable, however, that these vessels would not have drawn an appreciable quantity but would have refuelled chiefly in overseas ports.These figures are, of course, only approximate estimates, but the conclusioncan definitely be drawn that by the 1st April stocks in Unoccupied France of allproducts other than fuel oil were very small indeed.This viewr is supported by a recent statement from an apparently reliable source to the effect that by the 31st May, 1941, and perhaps sooner, stocks of oil in the Unoccupied zone will be almost entirely exhausted.In this connection it may be noted that the stocks of fuel and diesel oil in north and West Africa on the 1st April, 1941, are estimated to have been about100,000 tons compared with 325,000 tons on the 31st December, 1940.3. Italy.On the basis of the method of calculation adopted in previous reports, Italianstocks on the 1st April last wrould have amounted to about 1 - 25 million tons, andmight be lower if the increased activity in the Greek war has not been offset by recent slackening of operations of the Italian army in North Africa.Recent evidence from a source closely connected with the Italian Oil Industryup to the Italian entry into the war suggests that the estimate of 3 million tonsof stock made at that time was too high by perhaps f million tons. On this basis, stocks on the 1st April, 1941, would have been reduced to about \ million tons, which is approximately equal to the distribution minimum for Italy. Thisview is confirmed by the internal evidence, already referred to, which states that italy had no further reserves of oil at the end of 1940.

Italy.On the basis of the method of calculation adopted in previous reports, Italianstocks on the 1st April last would have amounted to about 1 - 25 million tons, andmight be lower if the increased activity in the Greek war has not been offset by recent slackening of operations of the Italian army in North Africa.Recent evidence from a source closely connected with the Italian Oil Industryup to the Italian entry into the war suggests that the estimate of 3 million tonsof stock made at that time was too high by perhaps f million tons. On this basis, stocks on the 1st April, 1941, would have been reduced to about \ million tons, which is approximately equal to the distribution minimum for Italy. Thisview is confirmed by the internal evidence, already referred to, which states that italy had no further reserves of oil at the end of 1940.
4. Controlled and Dominated Countries (excluding Franee).*It is not thought necessary to alter the figure of 0-6 million tons adopted inthe 5th Eeport for the stock position at the 1st October in the Controlled andDominated Countries, excluding France. At the estimated rate of consumption by these countries, the stocks should have been sufficient to last until the end ofMarch, but if, as is probable, part of them were consumed by the armies ofoccupation, the stocks may well have been exhausted by the end of 1940. This isthe date mentioned by the internal source, referred to above.5. Roumania.The stocks in Roumania at refineries and storage installations and in pipe-lines are estimated at about 1J million tons, but, unless transport facilities duringthe period under review exceed those for which we have allowed in the estimates which we think unlikely the Axis Powers will probably be able to absorb these stocks only to the extent of the supplies required by their Balkan armies or ifthey won access for sea transport from the Black Sea to Mediterranean ports.Internal Production.1. Synthetic.In the 5th Report it was estimated that the reduction of 15 per cent, in the productive capacity of synthetic plants for the year from October 1940 could safely be assumed, provided that the average scale of air attack was maintained on the level reached in the period May to October 1940. The weight of bombs dropped on these targets averaged 120 tons a month for the period May to november, but, for reasons of weather and other operational factors, the weightof attack fell to 51 tons in December, 54 tons in January and 93 tons in February.Evidence from photographic sources, particularly in the case of the Gelsenkirchenplants, and from other sources in regard to Leuna and Politz, forces the conclusionthat damage to synthetic jjlants may have been, until recently, less serious thanearlier rejoorts suggested. As regards refineries also, it may be mentioned that similar reports refer to damage at Hamburg and Bremen refineries as being slight,while the damage to the important Misburg refinery has been repaired and the plant is again in full operation. The theoretical methods of calculation on whichthe estimate of 15 per cent, was based have been reviewed and a report by the oil Advisor to the Bomber Command is attached (Appendix II), from which itwill be observed that damage for the period May-October 1940 should perhapsnow be estimated at 10 per cent., at the most, of productive capacity of synthetic plants. An internal source gives confirmation of this evidence in state-ments that destruction of synthetic production has been kept to moderateproportions and the output has not been seriously disturbed. In view of thedeclining weight of attack during the winter of 1940, we feel that reduction atsynthetic plants, during the six months October 1940 to March 1941, is not likelyto have exceeded 5 per cent, of the output during this period. For the second half-year we are assuming, for the purpose of these estimates, that there will beno loss of output from direct attack. This gives total production from the synthetic plants for the year of 2,850,000 tons. This figure may, in fact, be somewhat high, since it has been assumed that productive capacity has beenutilised to the full and no allowance has been made for such difficulties as shortageof skilled labour or power supply, which have been noted in other fields ofindustrial activity. Strong confirmation of this view is provided by the internalsource already referred to, which gives figures for the total production of aviation and motor spirit in Germany and implies that the hydrogenation plants had not,up to the end of 1940, been converted on any appreciable scale to the productionof Diesel oil.2. Domestic Crude.The estimates of finished products from oil fields in the Greater Reich,Hungary and Albania were given as \\ million tons a year. Intensive effortshave been made to increase the outflow of crude oil from the wells, and it is* Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Holland, Belgium, Hungary, Switzerland, Yugoslavia,Bulgaria.
reported that the Hungarian fields are likely to attain an output of 350,000 tonsa year from next September, as against an average rate of 250,000 tons assumed in the total figure given above. The Vienna Basin is said to be producing at separately of 400,000 tons a year. On the other hand, there is a report that the Germanfields are falling off, probably owing to over-stimulation in the first year of thewar. A reliable Polish report states that, though much has been done to exploit the Jaslo-Krosno oilfields under German control, there was, during 1940 at least,a definite decline of about 20 per cent, on the pre-war yield. In view of thesituation in Albania, it is certain that Italy has not secured the full capacityof these fields during the period under review. It is calculated that the effectof these changes, taken together, would be to maintain the estimates already adopted under this head.3. Benzol, Alcohol, Methanol, Tar Oil and Gases.The production of Benzol, Alcohol and Tar Oils has been re-examined andit is considered that no alteration, except in the case of Benzol, is needed to thefigures, totalling 850,000 tons for the twelve months, given in the 5th Report.Owing to the re-starting of coke ovens in the occupied countries the output ofBenzol is likely to be increased by 100,000 tons during the period April/Sep-tember. Combined production of the three products is, therefore, taken as525,000 tons for the second half-year and 950,000 tons for the twelve monthsunder review. There is evidence to show that the quantities of bottled gas, pro-clucer gas and town gas consumed during the six months ended March were50,000 tons in excess of the 250,000 tons previously estimated, but the figure of350,000 appears to be reasonable for the second half-year.Imports.1. Roumania.It is estimated in the 5th Report that the Axis Powers would obtain3j million tons in the year from the 1st October, 1940, from Roumania. this estimate also covers rationed supplies to Trance, Switzerland, Sweden, yugoslavia and Bulgaria. During the first six months it is calculated that actual imports were about 200,000 tons in excess of the estimate in the last Report. The Germanprogramme for supplies to herself, Italy, Slovakia and Switzerland was recently-reported to be 300,000 tons for April and 400,000 tons a month from Mayonwards, and this programme has been confirmed by the orders issued by Germanyto the petroleum industry in Roumania. This programme involves in the lattermonths an increase of 50 per cent, over the highest monthly export to this areahitherto reached. The Axis Powers are straining every effort to achieve thispurpose and their plans include the construction of two 10-inch pipe-lines fromPloesti to the Danube in addition to the existing 5-inch lines. Some delay isreported in the completion of these lines. The additional capacity will increasethe pipe-line off take by about 120,000 tons a month and set free a large number of tank cars for rail traffic. The Germans also aim at putting 200 new oil bargeson the Danube. The arrangements for supplies for France have hitherto met with little success. Sweden has been promised 8,000 tons a month by Germany,while it is calculated that Switzerland may get about 20,000 tons a month from roumania. Hungary is not likely to require anything beyond a small supply oflubricants. Allowing for probable shortcomings in an ambitious programme during the next six months, it is considered that the maximum estimate for theyear will not exceed 3^ million tons as given in the last Report. To this total,however, must be added the amount which Germany will draw directly from roumania for her forces in the Balkans, which is estimated at 100,000 and300,000 tons for the first and second half-years respectively. This estimate mightbe very substantially reduced if the Yugoslavs have been successful in seriouslyblocking the Danube before being forced to retire.2. Russia.The Monthly Review of the Enemy Oil Position, circulated on the 21st March,stated that fresh evidence made it necessary to increase the previous estimate ofsupplies from Russia which had been based upon deliveries as then reported.The effect of the revision will be to increase German stocks by about 150,000 tons at the 1st October, 1940, while supplies for the six months, October 1940 to March
1941, will be increased by 50,000 tons over the estimate of 250,000 tons for thisperiod in the 5th Report. It might be argued that the total estimate of700,000 tons for the whole year should be increased to 750,000 tons, but the rateof reported deliveries has been falling off in recent months, and there are some indications that Russia is not likely to be anxious to supply substantial quantitiesof oil to Germany in view of the present trend of events in the Balkans. Verylittle indeed was delivered by Russia to Germany in March. The future is, how-ever, obscure, and for the present the existing total of 700,000 tons for the year&apos;s  maintained on evidence that the Germans themselves expect about that amount in 1941. It may be noted that, of the reported deliveries in the ten months ending the 1st February, 1941, one-third was composed of gas oil, about 30 per cent, of fuel oil and about 20 per cent, of lubricating oils. The internal source already-referred to lays great stress on the importance to Germany of supplies of these products from Russia.Consumption.1. Air Force.The estimate for the German Air Force has been subject to revision in thelight of recent developments, but consumption is still estimated at an average ofapproximately 93,000 tons a month, or about the same figure as adopted for the5th Report. This may be compared with average consumption of 35,000 tons amonth for the R.A.F. in the United Kingdom and Middle East during the monthsSeptember to December 1940. The Air Ministry, however, desire to emphasise that one-third of the estimated German consumption is accounted for by three-engined bomber transport, a type to which there is no counterpart in the R.A.F.For the Italian Air Force, under present conditions, a revised estimate of105,000 tons a year is adopted as compared with 250,000 tons a year in the lastestimate. With the exception of the Albanian Force, the activity of the ItalianAir Arm is rapidly decreasing and it is difficult to forceast the future with any degree of accuracy.2. A rmy.The consumption by the German Army for the six months ended March 1941is estimated at 678,000 tons, including 99,000 tons used by the Army in the balkans. The greater part of this latter quantity was consumed in the monthsFebruary and March. The estimate for the next six months can only be verytentative, but on the basis of three months&apos; activity at the same degree as March,and three months quiescent period, during which the Army will be drawing the bare minimum for maintaining the necessary degree of efficiency, the half year&apos;sconsumption is estimated at 810,000 tons. 300,000 tons of these requirements will be accounted for by the Army in the Balkans. The total for the year is about1,500,000 tons, compared with 1,650,000 tons in the 5th Report.The consumption by the Italian Army is even more difficult to assess.Captures of vehicles have undoubtedly brought down the totals, but activity overthe past six months has been on a considerably larger scale than hitherto. on present information it is estimated that consumption may prove to be 100,000tons for the half year ended March and 90,000 tons for the following six months.The estimate in the last Report was 300,000 tons. As further evidence becomes available, it may be necessary to modify these figures.3. Navy.The revised service figures (1,090,000 tons) show an increase in the GermanNavy&apos;s consumption for the year ending September 1941 of 240,000 tons, ascompared with the estimates of the 5th Report, and reflect the increase in navalactivity. 540,000 tons are considered to have been consumed in the first half year,leaving 550,000 tons for the second six months.The present estimate for the Italian Navy is 330,000 tons for each of the half years under review and shows virtually no change compared with the previousestimate.The total consumption of the Axis Powers on their Armed Forces is thus4,725,000 tons, compared with 4,800,000 tons in the 5th Report.
4. Civil.Civil and industrial consumption m Germany, including substitutes, was put at 3-9 million tons in the 5th Report. This estimate has again been reviewed in detail in the light of further knowledge, including a survey of the developmentof substitute fuels, such as producer gas. The conclusion is that the formerestimate does not require alteration.In Italy, the intensification of restrictions on consumption of motor spirit,diesel and fuel oil may necessitate some reduction of the estimate of civilconsumption which was put at 1 - 3 million tons. Since this estimate represented a drastic cut on normal consumption and it will be necessary for Germany tomaintain the Italian war effort, the further reduction is not likely to be large.We are assuming a reduction of 150,000 tons in the second half of the year.Occupied and Dominated Countries.In the last report, probable consumption in the areas under domination of the axis was expected, to be about 20 per cent, of normal, or 2 - 4 million tons a year,and it was emphasised that this meagre ration was so low as to limit seriouslythe agricultural and industrial output. It may be observed that one of theprincipal oil companies, working on an intimate knowledge of the requirements ofthese countries, held that the controlled area would need at least 3f million tons as the absolute minimum for industrial and civil purposes without undue sacrifice of production, after full allowances had been made for severe restrictions on civiluse and for the adoption of substitute fuels wherever possible. Up to the present,occupied countries have been subsisting upon pre-war stocks which, as shown above, must now be exhausted.The estimate of consumption in France at 20 per cent, of normal is regardedas reasonable as an average for the whole of the country for the first six monthsof the period under review, although there is evidence that the consumption inthe non-occupied zone, including that of the French Fleet, was probably at ahigher rate. The restrictions, however, may have been more drastic in the occupied territory on account of the rigid German control. The total monthlyconsumption for the whole of France is estimated at 100,000 tons, of which75,000 tons were drawn from supplies in the non-occupied zone. The balance,25,000 tons, which included quantities used by the Police and Civil Administra-tive Services in the occupied zone, was probably provided from German sources.If German supplies, whether from Roumania or her own plants, are seriouslyreduced, supplies to the dominated territories would presumably be further cut,though this would seriously curtail Germany&apos;s ability to organise the industrial activity of those countries.It was recently reported that consumption of petrol had fallen to 10 per cent,of normal, or less, in Belgium, and to about 15 per cent, in Denmark, while in all areas supplies of diesel and fuel oil are either non-existent or very scarce.For the second half-year, however, the estimate of 20 per cent, is retained,since, provided there is no serious interference with her own production or hercommunications with Roumania. Germany would be in a position to supply this quantity without any serious drain on stocks.5. Destruction of Stocks.No allowance has been made in these estimates for loss of stocks as a resultof air attack on storage depots in Germany subsequent to the 1st October, 1940,or on oil in transit. It is very difficult to estimate accurately such losses, but itmay be mentioned that, so far as stocks in this country are concerned, some250,000 tons have been lost during the last eight months. Allowing for Germanand Italian tanker losses, the net reduction in stocks held by the Axis during the six months October to March may well have amounted to 100,000 tons. Althoughit is impossible to estimate losses from air action during the second six months,a tdken figure of 50,000 tons is allowed for tanker losses : if hostilities in north africa continue on a large scale, the figure may be considerably higher.Part II.-PARTICULAR PRODUCTS.1. Aviation Spirit.In the 5th Report it was stated that, apart from stocks which still remain,Germany would be almost completely dependent for high octane spirit upon theproduction of her hydrogenation plants, though as yet that position had not been
reached. Since then the Petroleum Board has analysed a number of samples, anda summary of their findings is given in Appendix IV. The position has alsobeen examined by the Technical Panel appointed at our last meeting, and theresults of their enquiry are as follows :  The fuels are all good quality hydrocarbon aviation spirits containing5 - 5 mis. Tetra-ethyl-lead per gallon, blended to 90 or 94 Octane Number.&quot; The 90 Octane Fuels, which predominate, are mixtures of petroleumspirit with one or more of the following : 30-50 per cent, hydropetrol (fromhydrogenation of coal or creosote); 5-10 per cent, synthetic Octanes; 15 percent. Aromatics (from coal tar or synthetic).&quot; The 94 octane fuels (used in Messerschmitt 110&apos;s) contain 30-40 percent, aromatics. approximately 10 per cent. Octanes and 50-60 per cent,petroleum spirit.&quot; The petroleum spirit may possibly be Roumanian, but may also bedrawn from reserves accumulated before the war.&quot;However, the number of samples that had been obtained recently was too small to allow definite conclusions to be drawn as to the trend of composition and as to the sources of the various constituents. It is unwise to pay undueattention to the peculiarities of individual samples which, in any case, are drawn from operational &apos;planes only, and these represent less than half the total consumption of aviation spirit.Thus, the evidence from analysis, so far as it goes, does not fully bear outthe deductions drawn in the last report. The evidence is not yet sufficient to solve the problem.The internal source puts production and imports of Aviation Spirit into germany at about 850,000 tons a year, and implies that since August some small quantities have been drawn fr-om the reserve stocks of about 600,000 tons to meetcurrent consumption.2. Gas and Diesel Oil.There is further evidence of a considerable deficiency of gas and diesel oilthroughout Axis-controlled Europe, and this is borne out by three independentexaminations of the relation between consumption and resources of this oil. Theinternal source lays considerable stress on this deficiency, and indicates that ithas been necessary to draw upon naval reserves for general consumption. these resources are likely to be exhausted by this summer, when the position will becomecritical, particularly in view of the demands for the occupied and dominatedareas. To meet the deficiency it will be necessary to recast the internal produc-tion programme to secure larger quantities of gas and diesel oil at the expenseof motor spirit. This is confirmed by reports from Roumania that Germany isendeavouring to increase the production of gas oil and kerosene to about700,000 tons per annum each. The additional kerosene will be used, in part, to supplement the deficiency of gas oil, and it is reported that Roumania isproducing for Germany a diesel blend, of which about 60 per cent, is gas oil andthe rest kerosene and heavy gasoline.3. Lubricating Oil.Further confirmation has been received of the view expressed in the5th Report that, while no general shortage has yet developed, there is a scarcity of some of the higher grades, and stress is laid on the importance in this respectof supplies from Russia. Germany has, in fact, been able to export small quantities of lubricating oils. The Petroleum Board Committee have summarised the results of the analysis of captured samples of lubricating oils as follows :  Early in the war some samples, as judged by British standards, were in poorcondition, but during the air battles of the summer and autumn of 1940 thecondition generally was good. Recently some samples have been found in poorcondition, which was in accordance with information that many captured Germanengines had been found to be very dirty. There was no evidence that thecondition of the samples was due to shortage of oil.Three-quarters of the samples were compounded with electrically treatedrape oil (Voltol). This is for the purposes of (a) improving engine performance,(&apos;&amp;) of improving inferior oils.   The mineral oil was partly derived from native
German crudes and partly from Roumanian distillates. So far there was no evidence of the use of Russian or of synthetic oils. There was no proof of adownward trend in the Viscosity Index as was at first thought. The importanceof Voltol to production was outstanding, and with its use there was little prospectof a shortage of lubricants suitable for aircraft engines.An enquiry into the distribution of production and consumption oflubricating oils indicates that, with the addition of treated vegetable oils andregeneration of used oil, the general position is not likely to give cause for anxiety.In Italy, however, there is a serious deficiency of lubricants, and it is under-stood that attempts to obtain supplies from Germany have hitherto not been successful. From Unoccupied France it is reported that railways and industrialfactories are affected by a scarcity of lubricants.The Transport Situation. x J&quot;L&apos;Hitherto the transport of Roumanian oil to Western. Europe has been alimiting factor in the use of this oil by the Axis Powers. This situation is likelyto be changed during the present six months by one and possibly two major events.The fact that Germany has now obtained control of all the countries through which her railway lines of communication run to the Roumanian fields will enable her to organise this traffic of it more efficiently than hitherto. It is also to beassumed that any necessary additions to rail tank cars or tank barges can andwill be made during the period under review. Railway experts estimate that ifthese railways were worked efficiently, to their full capacity, it would be possibleto carry over them the whole of the present export surplus (say 4,800,000 tons)of the Roumanian fields without monopolising more than 40 per cent, of theircarrying capacity.Since the major part of Germany!s present Roumanian supplies is normallycarried up the Danube, and since Danubian traffic is also no doubt susceptibleof considerable increase, it is possible that, given necessary priority for oil,transport will have ceased to be a limiting factor even in winter.If Germany succeeds in obtaining access by sea from the Black Sea toMediterranean ports, the transport problem will still further be alleviated.Russian supplies are for the most part normally transported over routesdistinct from those used by the Roumanian fields. If, however, transport facilities from the Roumanian fields to Germany exceeded the maximumRoumanian export surplus, the surplus carrying capacity could be used to liftadditional Russian supplies if any were available; alternatively, this additionalcarrying capacity would render fully mobile the free stocks in Roumania.Future Prospects.Hitherto, supplies to Germany during the winter months have been more restricted than supplies during summer months owing to the freezing of the danube. In view of the change in the transport situation, described above, itcannot be assumed that this situation will be repeated during the period October1941 to April 1942. Furthermore, during this period an increase in theproduction of synthetic fuels (which can roughly be estimated at 500,000 tons)may be expected to take place, and, in addition, further increase in the use ofsubstitute fuels. There is also no doubt that the output of the Roumanian fieldswill ultimately be considerably increased by German management.Thus, it would appear that Germany&apos;s oil situation is likely to be at itsweakest during the current period and thereafter to show gradual improvement.In this connection, it may be stated that a recent independent enquiry by acommittee of experts shows considerably higher potential resources, particularlysubstitutes, than we have estimated in this report, but the evidence before usindicates that this larger output has not yet been attained.On the other hand, if the German armies extend their fields of activity, forexample in Libya, Turkey or Spain, it will be necessary to build up supplies inthese countries, thus increasing the minimum distributional reserve. Moreover,if additional countries are occupied, it will be necessary to allow them a certain minimum consumption. In the case of Spain alone this might amount to half-a-million tons.
THE revised estimates for supplies, consumption and stocks of petroleum products and substitutes in German-dominated Europe as from the 1st October,1940, are summarised in the following table. The basis on which these estimates have been compiled is explained in the opening summary : Estimated Supply Position, October 194-.0-September 1941.(000 tons.)Figures in brackets are those adopted in the 5th Report.A.

Assessment of Damage to Synthetic Oil Plants.THE photographs of Scholven and Gelsenkirdhen hydrogenation plantstaken on the 24th December, 1940, when well over 100 tons of bombs had beenreported dropped on each target, showing both plants in operation and apparentlyundamaged, makes it necessary to reconsider the accuracy of the theoreticalassessment of damage previously made.The original assessment arrived at a figure for loss of production of about15 per cent, of nominal output from the synthetic oil plants in the period betweenthe 15th May and the 5th October. It is perhaps best to recapitulate in detail the basis of the damage assessment and consider the possible errors in each stage of the reasoning.The damage assessment was built up as follows :  (a) Analysis of the hydrogenation process into groups of sub-processes, suchas hydrogen manufacture, oil pumping and process control, high-pressure hydrogenation, &amp;c.(b) Determination of the importance of each sub-process to the operation ofthe plant        whole.(c) Estimate of the number of bombs required to cause complete stoppage ofeach sub-process.(d) Estimate of rate of repair of each sub-process after such damage.(e) Calculation of the expectation of damage that would be caused on theaverage by bombing attacks of various weight.(/) Calculation of the rate of recovery after attack.Item (c) was checked by an expert of the Home Office Explosives Dept.Stages (a), (b) and (d) were discussed with experts of the Billingham Hydro plant.It was necessary to make a number of simplifying assumptions about the areacovered by and layout of the sub-processes but, in weighing the values under (b)and id), no credit was taken for secondary fire damage and process interruptiondue to bombing of an operating plant, so that it is considered that the constantsprovided for the calculation under item (e) were conservative.Items (e) and (/) were calculated by Air Warfare Analysis, Harrow. A veryintricate mathematical study is involved, and it is certain that, if the constantsare correct, the calculated expectation of damage and recovery rates are accuraterepresentations of the average results to be expected. The difficulty lies in providing the correct constants, but those relating to the process are considered to be conservative.However, the calculation of expectation of damage also involves factorsrelated to the accuracy of bombing. The mathematical analysis is begun bycalculating the number and distribution of direct hits on units of the plant tobe expected from dropping a given number of bombs and completed by calculating the average interference with the process that may be expected to result.The calculation of direct hits secured is relatively simple, but depends on two factors : (1) Accuracy of bomb sight setting to correct for height, air speed and drift.(2) Accuracy with which the point of aim is selected.Item (1) has been discussed with G.C.Arm.. Bomber-Command, and isunderstood to be fairly constant. The factor used was considered to be quiteconservative, if the automatic bomb sight was properly used.As regards item (2), the A.W.A.S. study assumed no more than that bombs were released when the point of aim was any point whatever within the boundary of the target.From all the above a relationship was obtained between number of bombsaimed at the target and probable damage caused from which it was easy to calculate the probable loss on production resulting from the series of attacks asthey occurred.The number of bombs aimed was obtained by :  (3) accepting as aimed attacks all those sorties reporting &quot; target attacked &quot;whether or not any results were observed.After careful reconsideration of the chain of reasoning, the weakest linksappear to be items (2) and (3).
It is now realised that the synthetic oil plants are very difficult targets to see,except in exceptionally clear weather, and many of the sorties of last year weremade in poor weather and without the help of the moon. On many occasionstherefore the target was reported as attacked, without being seen, although locallandmarks would in that case have been used as a guide. It follows that veryprobably the point of aim under (2) was not in fact a point within the boundaries of the target. Under (3) it is probable that there have been occasions when asortie was reported as successful while, in fact, the pilot was mistaken and mayhave been a mile or more away.The relationship between bombs dropped and damage caused is being revised to see the effect of making the point of aim any point inside a circle of 1,500 yardsradius surrounding the plant, which will cover to some extent the error under (2)for sorties made on dark nights.However, there seems to be no way of checking the error under (3).Perhaps, to make a conservative estimate, all the bombing reports hithertoshould be gone through, discarding all sorties made without a moon and allsorties where results were not observed.However, a revised estimate made in this way would take some weeks tocomplete and since the 15 per cent, loss in production originally estimated is nota very large figure, the reduction of it to 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, would not materially alter the conclusions already reached about Gei&apos;many&apos;s oil positionas a whole and it is questionable whether the work involved is justified.It is not unreasonable to assume that about half the attacks reported havebeen actually effective and as a minimum the loss of production may be put at per cent.. On the other hand, the damage assessment does not provide forsecondary damage caused by fire and internal explosions in the plant due to air attack. Further, nothing has been allowed for loss of production caused by reductions in output and alterations in operating conditions which may follow thereceipt of air raid warnings at the synthetic oil plants when other industrial targets in the neighbourhood are being attacked. This factor would have mostweight in the case of plants in the Ruhr. Consequently, the maximum figuremay be as high as 10 per cent.APPENDIX III.Comparative Summary of a recent document from a most secret source, apparently- authentic, and referred to in this Report as &quot; an internal source.&quot;5th and 6th Reports and connectedpapers.Only 15 per cent, of productivecapacity regarded as out of action.

Roumanian supplies cannot betaken into consideration foraviation.5th and 6th Revolts and connectedpavers.Petroleum Department had estimated the same amount in October 1940.Report allows 600,000 tons of sub-stitute gases in Axis-dominated Europe for Germany this covers about 20 percent, of transport vehicles.All evidence points to a serious shortage :  (1) Use of producer gas allowed for 14,000 vehicles.(2) Mr. Berthoud reports exportof blend and of diesel, kero-sene   and   benzine,   from roumania.(3) It was also known that lightlubricating oil from Russiacould be used.Large  proportion  of  Italian  andFrench stocks and of Roumanian pro-ducts consist of fuel oil which is inexcess of requirements.    considerable quantities also available from low-tem-temperature carbonization plants.No general deficiency, but shortage ofspecial grades. Russia known to besupplying spindle oils and total sup-plies about 100,000 tons, or nearly20 per cent, of requirements of 550,000tons.This is recognised and allowed for,e.g., imports for second six months esti-mated at 2^ times those of first sixmonths.This is exactly the estimate for october 1940 to September 1941.Present situation within Axis likelyto cause serious concern there must beever-present fear of more concentratedattack on plants.Committee figures about 54 per cent,of total supplies excluding substitutes.Recognised that stocks in occupiedareas are practically exhausted. Otherrecent evidence supports the view that italian stocks are also very low.Not certain whether Roumanianpetrol used in German aviation spirit,but Roumania could supply about150,000 tons as maximum known thatGermany has ordered supplies of 73octane for her Balkan adventure and isarranging to raise it to 90 octane there.But Roumanian production of aviationgrade of 70 to 73 octane is probably notmore than 5 per cent, of her total petroloutput.
Technical Panel on the Axis Oil Position.THE opinion of the Petroleum Board Committee, based on the resultsof examination, since the commencement of their work, of samples of fuel from german aircraft is summarised as follows : (1) Specification. The fuels have all been of good quality, entirely of hydro-carbon composition, gum stable, low sulphur and normal boiling range; they appear to be blended either to 90 or 94 ON., the latter a highly aromatic fuel usedin Messerschmitt 110&apos;s.The essential differences from British fuels are the lead content, which is normally 5-5 c.c. T.E.L./I.G., and the absence of a 100 ON. grade. Other pointso&quot;f interest are, firstly, the vapour pressure, which is normally 5 to 6 lbs.,i.e., lJr lbs. lower than British maximum specification, though this may beattributable to weathering during flight; and, secondly, a tendency in the higharomatic fuels to allow some reduction in volatility, this being necessary as upto 25 per cent, of xylene and heavier is used as the aromatic addition.(2) Composition. The fuels have been made up of two or more of thefollowing components : (a) Straight-Run Spirit.(b) Hydropetrol.(c) Aromatics.(d) Octanes.It is evident that considerable variation in composition of individual sampleswill occur, due to deliveries from bulk supplies to main bases, filling on to part-empty tankage, either in air fields or the machines themselves, and therefore noundue attention is paid to individual samples. Trends have shown little, if any,change in supplies available, though it should be mentioned that during the winter of 1940, following a larger predominance of hydropetrol, there was a noticeabletemporary reduction in the number of hydropetrol type blends found. variation in the different components available has allowed blending to specification to becarried out.It is not possible to give a precise opinion of the origin of the variouscomponents, though further work may allow a closer judgment. The straight-runpetrol is apparently of two types, and is possibly Roumanian as well as drawn from reserves which were accumulated before the war. The bydropetrol is produced from coal or creosote and could, it is thought, if necessary, be improved in octane number at the expense of yield.(3) Performance. Arrangements are being made by the Ministry of aircraft Production to put in a German engine for fuel testing, and it is,therefore, too early to say much on this subject. The 90 ON. specification fuelshould, however, give engine results in line with its octane number, but it can beexpected that the 94 ON. specification fuel will rate very high due to the increasedaromatic content. The results of these tests will allow an opinion to be given asto whether the aromatics are incorporated to improve performance, because of shortage of other components, or because of transport difficulties.
