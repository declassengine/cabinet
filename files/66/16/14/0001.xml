THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AMD KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.CONDITIONS  IN POLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues a translation of aletter from the President of the Polish Republic to His Holiness the Pope.A copy of this letter was sent to the Prime Minister by M. Raczkiewicz.Foreign Office, April 23, 1941.Translation of a Letter addressed by the Polish President to HisHoliness the Pope.Holy Father, London, April 6, 1941.IN laying at the feet of Your Holiness the homage of my filial respect, Ibeg You to consider the misfortunes of my native land, which, at this moment,eighteen months after the resistance of the last regular forces in Poland, whowere struggling for the liberty of their country, was overcome, is suffering apersecution without parallel in the history of modern Europe.Your Holiness has without doubt been informed by Your clergy and by other sources, of the darkness of slavery and martyrdom which covers the two occupiedparts of Poland. My Ambassador to the Holy See has on several occasions beenable to communicate to the Cardinal Secretary of State memoranda about thestate of affairs in Poland. Latterly the Polish Government have sent to all allied and neutral Governments a general note, based on documentary evidence, proving that the two occupying Powers have committed deeds which violate all divineand human laws. This note necessarily contains only a part of the increasinglyterrible information reaching me from Poland.The picture is a very simple one. All Polish institutions and Poland&apos;national patrimony have been systematically destroyed, while millions of human beings are threatened with extermination. Deliberately the occupying powers are attempting to bring about the annihilation of present-day Poland and of thePoland of to-morrow. In addition to physical torture and famine they aresubjecting their victims to every device of humiliation and demoralisation. Acruel and premature death has been the lot of hundreds of thousands of human beings who have not fallen on the held of battle in the defence of their flag, but have been struck down by their persecutors in exile in Asia, in concentrationPrinted for the War Cabinet.

camps, and in prisons. Those who have remained alive are destined to become aherd of slaves in the service of foreigners; they are stupefied by the alcohol,gaming, and debauchery spread by the invader from the west, and other poisonsjnjected from the east.In spite of this oppression and suffering, in spite of enormous and ever-increasing losses, the soul of the Polish nation remains unconquerable. It admitsneither compromise nor collaboration with the aggressor. It is the onlyconquered nation in Europe where there have been no traitors and where evenopportunists are only found as rare exceptions. All the national forces within thecountry and beyond its frontiers have been mobilised to preserve the Fatherland.With a unanimity without equal the population of Poland is defending itself.In its struggle it seeks assistance, and awaits the voice of consolation from theChurch.I do not doubt that the Bishops and higher ecclesiastical authorities in Polandare aware of the attitude of Your Holiness towards the policy pursued by the occupying Powers towards the Polish population.   At the same time, I fear thatthe instructions of the Holy See only reach a small proportion of the faithful.Eight million Catholics of both cults under Soviet occupation no longer have anycontact with Rome.   Hundreds of thousands of Polish citizens, either prisonersof war or deported to concentration camps in Germany or incorporated against their will in the German army, have no contact with the Polish ecclesiasticalauthorities.  Millions of the faithful in the areas of western Poland annexed bythe  Reich  are  without   their  Polish  pastors,   who  have   been  martyred,imprisoned, or deported, while a vast number of churches have been secularisedor even deliberately destroyed.   These believers have sporadic contact with theGerman Catholic clergy, but far too great a proportion of the German people isintoxicated by the transient triumphs of German arms and corrupted by theopportunity of persecuting the weak and the conquered.   Too many germans have made common cause with their political leaders, who themselves are all tooclearly driven on by diabolical forces.   I am informed that certain Germanpastors, blinded by the fever of nationalism, are profiting by their position toterrorize the Polish faithful and to force them to adopt the German nationalbeliefs.But worse than all this the German authorities publicly declare that theirpolicy has received the approval and support of the Holy See. They allege thatthe Holy Father is an opponent of democracy and of the liberty of peoples, andthat He regards the organisation of the German &quot; New Order &quot; in Europe with confidence and goodwill. The Cardinal Secretary of State is in possession ofphotographic copies of declarations which have appeared in newspaperspublished in the Polish language by the Gestapo in Warsaw and in other townsin Poland. I am confident that these articles are only a part of those published in Poland by the Germans; and it may well be asked how many oral declarationson this question have been made by members of the German administration and,in general, by Germans everywhere in Poland, and what role a whisperingcampaign, in which the modern German so greatly excels, has played in all this.No human judgment can estimate the reactions of the Polish Catholics whoare subjected to this systematic and perfidious agitation. But I know my people and their attachment through the centuries to the faith of their ancestors and totheir unshakable national traditions. Therefore, I have the conviction that thisunexampled persecution will not succeed in destroying the living forces of thePolish nation.I am sure that the Poles will sustain one another and that a common effort will unite them until victory. But I am overcome by anguish when I think of themultitude of those who have been separated from the mass of the Polish people,and of the children torn from the side of their parents while still unconfirmedin the principles of faith and patriotism. With a sorrowful heart I think of theposition of the weak, the sceptical and the hesitating, of all the radical elementswith their tendency to form hasty judgments. In fact, is not this an unparalleledopportunity for the activities of all those of bad faith and for the birth of falseprophets ?The voices of enlightened and responsible men, good Catholics, reaching me from Poland, confirm me in my conviction that my anguish is justified. Theylead me to believe that my apprehension of this moral crisis in Poland witirregard to the Church is, alas, only too well founded.
That is the reason why I address myself to Your Holiness and, in the firmconviction that I am pleading a just cause, beg You to come to our help. I doso not only in my capacity as President of the Republic, but also as a Catholicbeliever and a faithful son of the Church. I address a filial prayer to YourHoliness to consider effective ways and means by which not only the clergy andthe enlightened classes, but also all Poles, however humble and poor they maybe, may learn the true feelings of the Holy See concerning the martyrdom of&quot;Poland.The Polish Government and myself ardently desire that all the millions of polish Catholics in Poland should remain Polish and Catholic. We are anxious that they should not be detached by terror and deceit from their Church, or fromtheir native land. I do not doubt that such is also the wish of the Holy See,and that it will find the means to confirm among these millions the conviction that they can still count upon the protection of Rome. And when I speak of effective means, I cannot overlook the fact that the Free Polish press only appearsillegally, and that it is only in Soviet-occupied Poland that Polish citizens canoccasionally listen to the wireless. Consequently, those two factors are not in themselves sufficient, and cannot reach all those who desire the support andconsolation of the Church.I have the firm hope that Your Holiness will deign to ponder the griefwhich has caused me to express in this letter my feelings and my ideas withsuch complete frankness. The Poles in Poland are completely cut off from the outside world and condemned to silence. It is only occasionally, and byanonymous and secret means, that their voices can reach the Holy See; but thelegal Government, directing their political and military activities from a freecountry, speaks in their name. The President of the Republic, responsible beforeGod and history for the defence of their moral and material interests, can andmust assume this duty.Poland has been occupied for a time, but she will soon be restored. Togetherwith her Allies and all men of good will, she will collaborate in the constructionof a new and better world. She will have before her the immense task ofeconomic and social restoration and reconstruction. An atmosphere of internalpeace is necessary for the accomplishment of this task. All sources of eventualinternal conflict must be eliminated in advance. That is why it is imperative that, as soon as hostilities cease, a continuous and confident collaboration shouldbe restored between the Holy See and the Polish State, continuing the collaboration which was maintained throughout the twenty years previous to thepresent war.The Polish nation has received with profound emotion the words of YourHoliness contained in the Encyclical &quot; Summi Pontificatus.&quot; It recalls these words with gratitude. Since then many months have passed full of cruel sufferingand of incessant and venomous hostile propaganda. The martyred Polish nation,in its profound attachment to the Church, turns its eyes towards the Vicar ofChrist and hopes to receive from Him words of consolation and encouragementwhich will help it to bear its misfortunes.In asking the Holy Father for His apostolic blessing on my whole country,on its martyrs, present and future, and on its soldiers, I remain the very faithfuland very devoted son of Your Holiness.(Signed) WLADYSLAW RACZKIEWICZ.
