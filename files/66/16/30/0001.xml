Under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920,. all questions of defence,including such matters as compulsory military service, are reserved to theImperial Parliament. - .v    .    &apos;- (     &apos;&apos;&quot;2.    When the Military Training Bill vras&apos;under consideration-in the early partof 1959 it was at first intended to include Northern Ireland within its. scope -and the Bill as introduced into.Parliament contained provision for &quot;its :- &apos;application to Northern Ireland by Order in Council.     Strong representations were made by the Government of-Eire, however, to the. British Government and,after discussion with the Government of Northern Ireland, the Bill was amended-.in Committee and. the Act as passed excluded Northern Ireland from its scope.Following this precedent Northern Ireland was also excluded from the &apos;   -national Service (Armed Forces) Act, passed later in the same year,    -&quot;-&apos;-&apos;3;&apos; In protesting strongly against the application of compulsory military. . :training to the people of Ulster the Eire Government stated -r. ...        &apos; -. .&quot;At least one third of the population there are cut off from Ireland&apos;&apos;against their will.     Any attempt to conscript them would he resentedas&apos; an outrage........... the introduction of Conscription . in. the six Counties, by the British Government for the British Army can &apos;ohly&apos;be -regarded as an act of war-against-our Nation, and will&apos;;, provoke&quot;. the.&apos;/;&quot;&apos;bitterest - hostility to England wherever there are Irishmen tlnroughqut &quot;the world.&quot;-;&apos; &apos;..&apos; . -&apos;4.     The Government of Northern Ireland acquiesced in the decision of; theBritish Government but only unwillingly, and the amendment excluding      &apos; &quot;-Northern Ireland from the Military Training Bill was strongly opposed by,.the ulster members in the Imperial Parliament, who carried the matter to a&quot;Division.5.     The views of the Governments of Eire and Northern-Ireland are much the sametoday, that is to say, the&apos; Government of Eire would object strongly to the.application of conscription to Northern Ireland, while the Government ofNorthern Ireland would welcome the introduction of a measure for this purpose.,subject, - however, to the over-riding consideration that the British government felt that such a measure-would\b.e in the best interests of the national war effort.     In addition it has always been alleged that the majority feelingamongst the people of Ulster would also be in favour of - conscription:,- &apos;  --6.     There is an acute and - increasing stringency of-man power .in Great britain for the Armed Forces, especially of men for general service in the Army. .Apart from young men asthejr reach the age of enlistment -land a very small number of men to be obtained.from the upper age groups now being registered -under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act, it is-&quot;neccssary to rely upon therelease of men&apos; from, industry - a slow and painful process, which quite naturallymeets with opposition both from industry and the Supply Departments.. -   Every,potential. source of supply should therefore be. carefully examined and I suggest.that the possibility of obtaining more men for the Armed-Forces from Ulstershould be reviewed. - -&quot; - - &apos;-*-7.     It had been hoped that substantial numbers of recruits from Ulster, wouldhave been obtained by voluntary methods.     Up to-March,&apos; however, these methodshad produced only about 25,000 &quot;recruits of whom an- unknown but, it is thoughtasubstantial proportion had come from Eire.    A special recruiting campaign..which
the War Office undertook in Northern Ireland last summer at the request ofLord Craigavon produced very few men and the War Office is understood to regard the monoy spent on that campaign as having &quot;been largely wasted.     The reasonsfor the reluctance .to volunteer are probably mixed, &quot;but a large factor is undoubtedly the fear that Northern Ireland may experience substantial unemploymentafter the war;   accordingly, since the right of re-instatement in employment afterthe war does hot extend to volunteers, men will not willingly give up their &quot;jobsto go&apos; into tho Armed Forces unless they are assured that, the obligation is generaland that their jobs will not be taken- permanently by others - possibly men of adifferent&apos;religion.    But whatever the reasons, the voluntary system must beregarded as a failure.8.     It is difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty how many men wouldbe obtained for the Armed Forces from Northern Ireland under a compulsory system.After making full allowance for a number of factors which might tend to reduce the yield - for example, the large proportion of the population engaged, in agriculture,the possibility of a .high proportion of conscientious objectors, the possibility that a substantial number of men might slip over the&apos; bordor into Eire, the largenumber of pre-war special constables who might have to bo retained oh theirexisting duties, etc. we could expect to got not less than 40,000. additional menbetween now and next March while the number might well bo 60,000 or oven higher.Even 40,000 men would be a welcome addition to our resources.9.     The.introduction of conscription would also assist in the solution of theproblem of unemployment in Northern Ireland on which frequent representations havebeen made by the Northern Ireland Government.     The number of males aged 18 and overrecorded as unemployed on 21st April last amounted to about 16,000, and this numbcrmay increase substantially in the fairly near future when work on certain newairfields comes to an end.     It has been suggested that this problem could be easedby the establishment of additional war industries in Northern Ireland or by bringingmen from Northern Ireland to work in Great Britain.     Both these possibilities havebeen fully examined, and something has been done, but there is not much more, that can be done in the way of establishing further war industries in Ulster, while asregards the second suggestion there is already evidence of a certain resentmenthere because young Irishmen have taken, up,jobs vacated by British subjects called,to the Colours, and.are sometimes billeted on homes from which sons have gone, intothe Forces. .&apos;&apos;... &apos;&apos;y:&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;,.10.   The main, difficulty in extending conscription to Northern Ireland.is of course the point mentioned&apos;in paragraph 3, namely, the presence in Northern Ireland&quot; of asubstantial number of,.men whose &quot;syiiipathies.With Eire may cause them&apos;to resent andresist conscription.     It will bp open to such men to seek to register asconscientious objectors and.&apos;it&apos; Is possible that a. substantially larger proportionof men may establish.their. objection than is the case in Britain, but unless theinterpretation of conscientious objection is made much wider than it is in britain, conscientious objection will not cover any larger .proportion of those whoon strictly nationalistic- grounds would resist serving in the British. Army.    the wider political aspects of this difficulty, that is to say, its bearing uponfeeling both in Eire itself and in America or other parts of the British Commonwealthare matters beyond my scope as Minister of Labour.     In its narrower aspects, thedifficulty should not be regarded as a fatal objection to conscription.     No doubtsome of thesO men will escape, into Eire.     For the others, ho.special concession should be made, except in so far as it may.seem possible to enlist a larger .proportion than normally of the men from Northern Ireland in the pioneer corps forwhich they would be well suited,,11*   It is clear that, in order to reduce so far as possible the resistance to conscription in Northern Ireland itself, it is essential to ensure completeimpartiality in the administration of the scheme, especially in such matters aspostponements on hardship grounds, conscientious objection, order of calling up formilitary service, etc. .  This requirement will be. met to some extent by the fact thatthe scheme itself will remain the responsibility of&apos; the United Kingdom Government,although it will no doubt be necessary for it to.be administered by the Ministry ofLabour for Northern Ireland as agents&apos;for the United Kingdom Government.     In additionI should be willing;: if the Government of Northern Ireland so desiro, to lend one ortwo of my officers to .tha&apos;t Government for a time in order to help in the establishmentof the necessary-liiachinery and the administration of tho scheme.     I propose to discussdetails of this-&apos;kind with the Minister of Labour for Northern Ireland as soon as theprinciple of conscription is agreed.12.   Subject to the above considerations, and to the views of the Government ofNorthern Ireland on the question of principle, I propose, that tho necessary legislation for the application of conscription to Northern Ireland should be drafted and presented to parliament without delay,21st May, 1941.
