NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.An enemy convoy has been destroyed by our forces in the Mediterranean, andon the Libyan coast naval units have afforded effective support to our troops.A successful raid on a Norwegian oil factory was carried out by a norwegian unit.Shipping losses have been lower than of late.Home Waters.2. M.T.B&apos;s carried out a sweep off the Dutch and French coasts on the night of the 10th/11th April, and attacked a tanker and two trawlers off Dieppe with torpedoes, one of which is believed to have hit. One M.T.B. was damaged by enemy gunfire. Other M.T.B. sweeps carried out during the week wereunproductive.The Norwegian Destroyer Mansfield destroyed the herring oil factory atOeks Fjord, south of Hammerfest, on the 12th April. No enemy shipping ortroops were encountered.H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Rajputana was torpedoed and sunk by aU-Boat 150 miles to the westward of Reykjavik early on the 13th April.Forty-one of the crew are missing and two are known to be dead.H.M. Submarine Tigris sank a 10,000-ton armed tanker in the Bay of Biscayon night of the 2nd/3rd April.H.M. Trawler Kingston A mber shot down an enemy aircraft off Ventnor onthe 14th April, and the Free French Submarine Chaser No. 41 shot one downoff the Nab early on the 12th.Two auxiliary patrol vessels have been sunk by mine and another was damaged by bomb.  Details are given in Appendix V.Mediterranean.3. Captain D. of the 14th Flotilla in H.M. Destroyer Jervis, with three other destroyers, intercepted an enemy convoy off the African coast between sicily and Tripoli on the night of the 15th/ 16th April. The convoy consisted of two ships of about 5,000 tons laden with motor transport, an ammunition ship ofabout 4,000 tons, and two ships of about 3,000 tons, which were probablytransports. The escort was the Italian destroyer Luca Tarigo (1,648 tons, built1928), and two of the Climene class destroyers (652 tons, built 1936-37). Theentire enemy force is believed to be destroyed. During the action H.M. DestroyerMohawk was torpedoed and sank, and of her crew seven officers and 160 ratingswere rescued. The other destroyers had no casualties and sustained only slightsplinter damage. Owing to the approach of daylight it was not possible to waitand pick up enemy survivors.H.M. Ships have successfully bombarded enemy positions and transportcolumns on the Libyan coast.   H.M. Gunboat Aphis destroyed 5 enemy aircraft during a bombardment of Gazala aerodrome, and on the 15th the fire of H.M./5s^*v&quot; Ships Griffi,n&apos;jtm!/&amp;na&apos;t and H.M. Australian Destroyer Stuart enabled our troops jv   to hold Sollum.  Gnat was damaged by a mobile battery. &amp;**^*L*&apos; &amp;****-^ $A successful bombardment of Fort Capuzzo was carried out  and a largenumber of salvos were seen to burst among a concentration of enemy tanks and vehicles. It appears that the enemy is not yet using Benghazi or ports to theeast of it.On the 12th April H.M. Submarine Tetrarch torpedoed a south-bound fullyladen tanker north of Tripoli.4.   Aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm attacked shipping in Valona Bay on the evening of the 14th April and blew up a 7,000-ton ammunition ship and hit a  16,000-ton ship.   They also attacked a convoy off the Gulf of Hammamet on the evening of the 12th April, but though the ships were straddled they proceededwithout apparent damage.During the recent operations Naval units have destroyed two Ju. 88&apos;s and damaged two others. Air attacks on Greek ports during the week have beensevere. Unloading by lighters is believed to be continuing, but the rate of convoymovement has been reduced.
The British hospital ship Vita was deliberately bombed on the afternoon ofthe 14th April whilst evacuating patients from Tobruk, and the Greek hospital ship A ttiki was sunk in the Doro channel on the 11th April whilst fullyilluminated.During the week nine French merchantmen eastbound and six westboundhave passed Gibraltar; all were under escort.Other Foreign Stations.5. H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Voltaire has not arrived at Freetown,where she was due on the 9th April, and no report has been received from her.A German communique claims that she has been sunk by a raider.H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Dunnottar Castle intercepted the VichyFrench Ship Banfora (9,346 tons) on the 12th April and after considerable opposition from the crew placed an armed guard on board and sent her intoFreetown.It is reported that 5 French merchant ships escorted by two 6-inch cruisers and destroyers and submarines left Dakar on the 10th April. On the 12th, a french cruiser with light cruisers and destroyers were sighted 70 miles to the southward of Cape St. Vincent steering North-West.Although the entrance to Massawa harbour is partially blocked, a clearpassage still exists and one 400-ft. ship could be berthed. The water-distillingplant and lighting are intact. Both floating docks are sunk. The northernChannel was swept on the 13th to allow small vessels to enter with supplies. A5-ton floating crane and a number of lighters are available for unloading.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. H.M. Corvette Fleur de Lys made a series of attacks on a U-Boat onthe morning of the 14th April about 100 miles west of Gibraltar. At the end&apos;of the attacks no contact could be obtained and there was thick oil on the surface.On the afternoon of the same day H.M. Trawler Scottish attacked a U-Boat17 miles away from the Fleur de Lys&apos; position but obtained no visible result.Aircraft of the Coastal Command attacked U-Boats off the Norwegian coast onthe 11th and 16th April. On the 11th the bombs fell within forty yards and the crew were machine-gunned and some jumped into the water. On the 16th. the bombs straddled the stern of the U-Boat and two large patches of oil were seen on the surface after she had crash dived.Enemy Intelligence.German.7. The battle cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were still at Brest on the17th April, one in the western dry dock and one alongside the T.B. Station. Thetorpedo nets round the latter have been extended, giving 300 feet clearance southof the ship.A report, received on the 13th April, stated that the Gneisenau, whilst inDry Dock, had been hit aft by two bombs. During the night of the 14th/15thApril a Wellington bomber claimed a direct hit on the battle cruiser in dry dock.One Bismarck class battleship has been reported as having entered LubeckBay on the 2nd April and the cruiser Koln was there on the 30th March. Theother Bismarck class battleship is probably at Gdynia.It is reported that E-Boats have passed Lyons by river for the Mediterraneandisguised as lifeboats, with the crews in plain clothes, and that twenty-threeE-Boats arrived at Marseilles via the Rhone on the 7th April.Italian.8. The destroyer Cesare Battisti is reported ashore north of Lith (about100 miles south of Jeddah). If this is correct, all Italian Red Sea destroyers andT.B&apos;s. are now accounted for with the possible exception of the Orsini, which wasin harbour at Massawa on the 8th April. The Cesare Battisti could not be seen from the air, but may have sunk in deep water.During the week several small convoys of merchant vessels escorted by destroyers have been sighted proceeding between Tripolitania and Italian or&apos;Sicilian ports.[22427] b
On the 11th April there were eight destroyers at Tripoli. Reconnaissance by aircraft on the afternoon of the 13th April showed four large warships in theroadstead at Durazzo and three large and three smaller warships about 8 milesout. On the 14th April it was reported that one Cavour-class battleship was ina flooded floating dock at Genoa and one Oriane-class destroyer also present. AtSpezia one 8-inch cruiser was in dry dock and one destroyer and one submarinewere also present. On the 16th two 6-inch cruisers and four destroyers were atPalermo.U-Boats.9. During the week the number of U-Boats in the Western Approaches hasincreased and is now approximately 14 German and 4 Italian.The positions of these range in latitude from the South of England to theSouth of Iceland and in longitude from Mid-Atlantic to the Irish Coast. Apatrol line appears to have been established along the meridian of 30o West\i.e., 200 miles to the West of Iceland), eight U-Boats being spread out on this.Two German U-Boats have operated to westward and south-westward ofFreetown, and on the 14th Iavo were south of Azores moving south apparentlyto relieve these.On the 11th April a U-Boat was north-east of St. paul&apos;s Rocks and may have moved to the east of Pernambuco.In last week&apos;s Resume it was stated that it appeared reasonably probablefrom the examination of prisoners of Avar that the Submarine CommanderGunther Prien was lost in U. 76. Gunther Prien was. not in U. 76, but in another U-Boat which may possibly ha\Te been sunk by H.M.S. Wolverine,although this is by no means certain.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.10. According to the information at present available the merchantshipping losses during the week ended noon, Wednesday, the 16th April,amounted to 17 ships (66,466 tons), of which 8 ships (28,133 tons) were British.Five ships were sunk by submarine, three in the North-Western approaches and Iavo off Freetown. Ten ships were sunk by aircraft, five of them in Greekwaters, four in coastal waters in the south of England and one in the North-Westeni Approaches.  One ship was mined in the Thames.Apart from two clays when the Aveather was unsuitable, one or tAvO convoyshave been attacked each day, but only two convoys were attacked off the east coast.There has been no concerted U-Boat attack on a convoy during the period.Details are given in Appendix I of losses and damage to ships of whichaccurate information has noAv come to hand. These losses total 32 ships(119,279 tons), of which 15 ships (49,779 tons) form part of the casualties givenin the paragraph above. Of the remaining earlier losses 8 ships (34,941 tons)Avere sunk by submarine, 2 ships (8,696 tons) were sunk by raider, 7 ships(25,025 tons) by aircraft and 1 ship (838 tons) by unknown cause. In additiondetails were given of 17 ships which have been damaged.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ended noon the 16th April 839 ships, including150 Allied and 13 neutral, were convoyed. Two battleships, 6 cruisers, 13 armed merchant cruisers, 2 submarines, 62 destroyers, 58 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duty. Since the beginning of the war 60,229 ships have beenconvoyed, of which 297 have been lost by enemy action.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the12th April totalled 376,437 tons, compared with 727,233 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 625,218 tons during the past ten weeks. Oil imports were 102,706 tons in nine tankers, compared with 213,728 tons in 21 tankersduring the week ending the 5th April. Mineral imports were 99,230 tons, ofwhich 91,267 tons Avere steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. The corresponding figures for the previous Aveek were 187,402 tons and 124,039 tons. Timber imports were 21,531 tons and cereal imports 96,394 tons, 12 ships being fully laden withgrain.   Other food imports were 21,436 tons.   Among machinery imports were
1,662 tons of machine tools. Figures were below average owing to the dispersaland return of one convoy and the loss of the ten ships in the homeward Canadianconvoy which was reported in last week&apos;&apos;s Resume.British Minelaying.12. On the 16th April H.M.S. Plover laid 120 mines in St. George&apos;s channel.Our minelaying aircraft have been very active during the week, mainly offthe French Atlantic ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.13. The Bristol Channel, and more particularly the Milford Haven area,has been the principal scene of enemy aircraft in minelaying operations this week.Aircraft which were suspected of minelaying were operating off the East coastduring the night of the 9th/10th April, and minelaying on a small scale issuspected off the Tyne, the Humber, Liverpool and Falmouth. Mines were probably dropped off Belfast on the night of the 15th/16th April.Mines were reported to have been dropped off the Isle of Man on the15th April, but their position was in an area already declared dangerous.During the night 10th/11th April several mines were dropped in theSouthampton area, some of them in the Hamble River.During the week 18 magnetic and 30 acoustic mines have been detonated in home Waters.   The mine totals are magnetic 1,067, acoustic 510, contact 852.Foreign Waters.14. The Piraeus was again mined by enemy aircraft on the evening ofthe 9th April. Minesweeping is being carried out but so far with negative result,at the time of the last report, as no really efficient acoustic gear was available.Two mines have been countermined with depth charges. On the night of the11th/12th April enemy aircraft laid mines in the Athens area in Phalerum Bay,Salamis Strait, and in Eleusis Bay.The Italians are reported to have heavily mined the North Channel, Massawa.Sweeping operations are in progress.Enemy Merchant Shipping.Germany.15. The Portland (7,132 tons) is said to have arrived at Cadiz on the4th April. She sailed from Talcahuano with a general cargo on the 30th January,and is said to have rounded Cape Florn and refuelled from a tanker which was working in the South Atlantic with a raider. The Osorno (6,951 tons) which was reported to have sailed from Talcahuano on the 2nd April, is said to be proceeding in a similar way. The Portland may have reached a French port in the Bay of biscay, but there is no confirmation that she has reached a Spanish port.On the 9th April H.M.I.S. Hindustan intercepted a lifeboat with thirteenGermans in it from the Lichtenfels (7,566 tons). This ship had been in Massawasince September 1939.The Thai Government is rumoured to be considering the purchase of the5 Axis ships (total 31,000 tons) in Thai ports.On the 9th April the Hermes arrived at Rio de Janeiro with a general cargo,the crew stating that they had left Bordeaux on the 12th March; she was lateridentified as the Karnak (7,209 tons), which had been at a French port.Italian.16. A report from Massawa says that some twelve ships lie round the harbour either heeled over on sandbanks or with their masts and funnels showingabove the water; all appear to be salvageable.On the 11th April three merchant ships, two of which were on fire, were reported to be in Assab. Enemy merchant ships previously known to be therewere the German Gera (5,155 tons), the Italian Arabia (5,943 tons), Hazario Sauro(8,150 tons) and the Tripolitania (2,722 tons).
MILITARY SITUATION.Italy.17. In conformity with the German plans an Italian force of some 7 to 8divisions has advanced into northern Yugoslavia. This force will probably assistthe Germans by occupying the less warlike districts of the country.There is little information of any military activity elsewhere in Italy andalthough there are still 39 divisions in the country they are mostly made up of reservists and recruits. As Italy is now little but an echo of German policy, itis probable that the future of these formations will be decided in Berlin.The Balkan Operations.(An outline map showing the lines of the German invasion of Yugoslaviais included as an inset to this Resume)Albania.18. The Italian situation is confused. Operations against the Greeks havebeen on a small scale and nothing is known of any operations against the Yugo-slavs reported to be advancing south from Scutari. The present Italian garrisonis 28 divisions estimated at 400,000 less an unknown figure of recent casualties.Yugoslavia.19. The capitulation of the Yugoslav Government will release severaladditional German divisions for use against Greece, but a considerable numberwill, no doubt, have to be earmarked for internal security and the protection ofGerman lines of communication against guerilla attacks.20. So far as can be seen at the present stage, the Yugoslav campaign revealsno new feature in German strategy. The pincer movement and the endeavour to cut between allied armies or to separate two parts of the opposing force are allfamiliar. As usual, the Germans depended on weight of numbers and material and speed of movement for success. They also followed their usual practice inthat they made their thrust into the South-Eastern corner of Yugoslavia by aroute considered extremely difficult for armoured formations and thereforeunlikely to be selected.Greece.21. The Greek campaign also appears to be developing along the lines ofthe pincer movement. One arm is moving along the coast from Salonika, passingbetween Mount Olympus and the sea, while the other is passing south fromFiorina through Ptolemais. A thrust south-westwards from florina apparentlyaims at cutting off the Greeks in the Koritza area again a pincer movement when taken in conjunction with the advance south-westwards from Lake Ochrida.Turkey.22. An official communique issued on the 10th April announced the evacua-tion of certain classes of the population from the Istanbul area to any part ofAnatolia except the towns of Izeir, Ankara and Erzurum. The Government isproviding transportation for evacuees up to the 15th April. Oil stocks from the bosphorus are also being evacuated to Anatolia and future deliveries will bemade in Izeir and Iskanderun.U.S.S.R.23. Further German troop movements towards the Soviet frontier are reported, but there is still no indication that these will result in the total forces there being increased. A report that Russia is moving troops to the West suggeststhat they may be taking the German threat seriously.It is still impossible to determine whether the persistent rumours, coming from so many quarters, that Germany is intending to attack Russia in the nearfuture, are merely being spread by Germany as part of a war of nerves or have some more solid basis in fact.
Africa.Libya.24. The present Italian garrison comprises four infantry divisions, one armoured division and one motorised division, estimated at a total of about80,000. Of these,, one infantry division and an armoured division have been taking part in the Axis operations in Cyrenaica, and it is possible that a secondinfantry division has been employed on L. of C. duties.25. Advanced enemy elements made contact with the Tobruk defences on the10th April, and were astride the road Tobruk-Bardia on the 11th, a supportgroup of our troops falling back from El Adem on Sollum. Attacks on Tobrukfrom South and West on the 12th were repulsed, the R.A.F. assisting with attacks against enemy A.F.V&apos;s, but the enemy in armoured cars succeeded in occupyingBardia.On the 13th April the enemy occupied Capuzzo, and brisk fighting-commenced around Solhim.On the 14th a deliberate attack on Tobruk was attempted by infantry and tanks, the latter penetrating the perimeter, but the attack was repulsed with loss to the enemy of at least 20 tanks destroyed, 100 men killed, 263 Germans and70 Italians captured. The prisoners&apos; morale was low. An air attack was alsorepelled, 12 out of 50 bombers being shot down.Successful raids and skirmishes continue in the Capuzzo-Sollum area.From the 17th April Lieut.-General Beresford Peirse assumed command of western Desert Force, including Tobruk Fortress.Sudan.26. An envoy from the Duke of Aosta arrived by air in Khartoum on the15th April. He was told that we would accept no further responsibility for the safety of civilians in Ethiopia unless the Italians laid down their arms. A reply was demanded by 0615 hours, the 17th April.A abyssinia.27.   Our forces have advanced 100 miles from Addis Ababa to the north.AIR SITUATION.General Review.28. Night operations by Bomber Command were somewhat restricted by weather conditions, and attacks were largely confined to the reduction of the scale of attack on our shipping. During daylight, attacks on enemy coastal vessels wrereintensified and Fighter Command concentrated on protection of shipping patrols.The week was notable for the heaviest raid yet made on London, and for thefirst heavy raid on Belfast and Northern Ireland.Germany and Occupied Territory.29. During the week Bomber Command carried out 213 day and 586 nightsorties; this is a substantial increase in the scale of operations by day, and adecrease by night. These operations were supported by Coastal Command, and fighter Command flew a number of offensive patrols over enemy-occupied territory.Day.30. The majority of daylight sorties was again directed against enemy shipping, details of which will be found under Coastal Operations. A successfullow-flying attack by eight Blenheims was made on the town of Norderney; manybursts were observed on the buildings, which were left in flames. Another goodattack was made on Heligoland. Direct hits were also reported in the powerhouse and gasometer at Leyden power station, on a watch tower and buildingson the Island of Amrum, on a wireless station at Lisse, where a pylon was blownup, and on Haarlem electricity power station.[22427] c
31. Offensive operations were carried out by Fighter Command overNorthern France without encountering . serious opposition. On the 16th,thirty-eight fighters escorted six Blenheims in a successful attack on Berckaerodrome, where two hangars were hit; three of the fighters were missing after an engagement with Me. 109&apos;s. Many low-flying attacks were also carried out and troops, lorries, gun emplacements and aerodromes were machine-gunned.Twelve heavy aircraft were attacked on the ground at an aerodrome near Crecyand a seaplane being towed near Calais was probably destroyed. One Hurricanewas intercepted near Hazebruck by four Me. 109&apos;s, one of which was destroyed,but the combat was carried out at such a low level that the tail of the Hurricanehit the ground and the aircraft crashed through a high-tension cable.Night.32. Attacks were continued on the battle cruisers at Brest and, on two nights, 137 aircraft took part in them. Bombs up to 4,000 lbs. in weight were dropped and&apos; a large number hit the docks around the ships. One Wellingtonclaimed a direct hit from 3,000 feet with a 1,000-lb. bomb on the battle-cruiser indry dock, and other hits were thought to have been made. Bursts were also seen on the barracks and considerable damage occurred in the dock area. Threesuccessful attacks, involving thirty-eight bombers, were made on Marignac aero-drome, Bordeaux, the headquarters of the Focke-Wulf units; several hangarswere hit and some large fires were started.33. On the night of the 15th/16th, a heavy attack was made on the ship-yards and industrial area at Kiel; 78 tons of H.E. bombs and 7,650 incendiaries were dropped, but results were generally difficult to observe on account of poorvisibility. One 4,000-lb. bomb burst near Krupps Germania Works, causing an explosion which appeared to cover a very large area. On the following night anattack on a similar scale was made on the Deutsche Schiff shipyards and industrialdistrict of Bremen, but again weather conditions hampered observation of results.34. An attack on the industrial centre of Dusseldorf was carried out bythirty bombers on a cloudy night, but one large fire was observed. conditions were, however, clear over Lorient submarine base; twenty-two tons of bombs were dropped and a very large fire was started at the Naval Ordnance Works. Anumber of alternative targets were also attacked by single aircraft. With theexception of the night of the 10th/11th, when seven of our bombers failed toreturn, our casualties were not heavy.United Kingdom.35. Fighter Command flew 1,264 patrols, involving 3,077 sorties, by day,and 747 patrols, involving 1,178 sorties, by night. Enemy activity by day was again on a small scale, but by night there was a further increase, nearly 1,500aircraft being employed. Thirty enemy bombers were destroyed by night,twenty-one being shot down by fighters.36. Enemy daylight operations again consisted largely of patrols in theStraits of Dover. There was very little activity overland, except on the15th April, when about fifty enemy aircraft made brief fighter sweeps over Kent.37. The raids on the first two nights of the week were on a fairly heavyscale, and were directed, on the first night, mainly against Birmingham andCoventry, and against Bristol on the second. Heavy attacks were not resumedtill the 15th, when Belfast and Northern Ireland were attacked for the first time;on the following night London received the heaviest raid of the war, as many as460 enemy aircraft being identified in the attack.Coastal Operations.38. Coastal Command aircraft flew 257 patrols and provided 449 sorties forthe escort of convoys. Fighter Command made 1,666 sorties on shippingprotection patrols.39. Coastal Command aircraft made some successful attacks on enemy shipping. A direct hit and a near miss were scored on a merchant vessel of8,000 tons off Havre.  Another vessel, of 1,500 tons, near the Lister Light was hit
and seen to be sinking by the head. Off Egersund and Obrestadt near misseswere made on ships of 2,000 and 4,000 tons respectively, while, near Fecamp, a10,000-ton merchant ship was missed by ten yards; near misses were also observed in other attacks. A Beaufighter shot down a Focke- Wulf long-range aircraft offAchill Head, and a Blenheim also destroyed a Me. 110. On the 14th April, aCoastal Command Spitfire made an eight-hour flight to Genoa and Spezzia and carried out a very successful photographic reconnaissance.40. A number of attacks on enemy coastal shipping were also made by bomber Command aircraft. Three naval minesweepers were attacked offNorderney, one being hit twice and another probably hit. A cargo vessel of 2,000 tons near Borkum was last seen well down by the stern, while two other vessels of 3,000 and 4,000 tons respectively are believed to have been hit, andalso an &quot; E &quot; boa,t and a ship of 500 tons, off Haarlem. Two coastal vessels of350 tons were destroyed southwest of Belle Isle, and a 4,000-ton freighter inBorkum Harbour received a direct hit amidship and was seen to disintegrate.41. During the week, mines were laid by aircraft of Coastal and bomber command, principally off Brest and La Pailice. No enemy aircraft were detectedlaying mines in daylight, but an average of twenty were out per night.Malta.42. Wellingtons from Malta bombed Tripoli harbour twice during the week.Direct hits were made on the customs wharf, on the northern mole, on the break-water and on shipping.  One ship was set on fire.43. Enemy operations were on a heavier scale than in the previous week.On the 11th April, a formation of Me. 109&apos;s, Me. 110&apos;s and Ju. 88&apos;s operated offthe Island, and on the 11th/12th ten aircraft, believed to have been Ju. 87&apos;s,carried out a bombing attack. During the following night, two attacks weremade by unidentified aircraft and at dawn on the 13th, eight Ju. 87&apos;s attackednaval units in the Grand Harbour and Takali Harbour. Later in the day twelveMe. 109&apos;s and two Ju. 88&apos;s attacked Luqa aerodrome.The scale of effort was increased on the 13th/14th, when about thirty aircraft,including Ju. 87&apos;s and Ju. 88&apos;s, attacked in three waves, dropping bombs in anumber of localities. In these operations at least four German aircraft were shot down. In relation to the weight of attacks the damage inflicted was notheavy, and Service damage and casualties were only slight.The Balkans.44. During the week, our aircraft have continuously bombed and machine-gunned enemy transport and troops on roads and railways and have destroyed aconsiderable number of armoured vehicles. An important bridge over the RiverVardar, at Veles, was destroyed by Wellingtons on the 14th/15th April.45. The marshalling yards at Sofia were heavily attacked twice by ourWellingtons on the 13th/14th. Several direct hits were made on railway trucks;two rows of these, believed to contain explosives, blew up with terrific detonations.The station and a train were also hit.46. Enemy operations consisted chiefly of close-support operations by dive-bombers and fighters. Activity increased in the northern part of Yugoslavia,whilst that on the Greek border was on much the same scale as during the previousweek. Long-range bomber activity was on a small scale and consisted chiefly ofraids from South-East Germany on towns in Yugoslavia, and from Bulgaria onthe Greek ports. The Mediterranean component also undertook bombing andmine-laying in the Piraeus and Volos districts. Short-range units are moving uprapidly with the army, transport aircraft being used on a considerable scale toassist in these moves. The composition of the forces in the South-East is substantially the same as during the previous week.47. The Piraeus was attacked four times by enemy aircraft. Several enemy aircraft which took part in these attacks were destroyed by our fighters. the damage done to shipping in the harbour is reported in the Naval Situation.
48. In spite of Yugoslav claims to have accounted for. a considerable numberof German aircraft, the Yugoslav Air Force appears to have been surprised andoverwhelmed, a large proportion of the aircraft being destroyed on the ground.It is improbable that more than a very few aircraft have been successfully with-drawn from the country.Dodecanese.49. On the 11th/12th April, four Wellingtons made a successful attack onCalato aerodrome in Rhodes. A petrol store was set on fire and other damage was caused.Egypt and Libya.50. Our aircraft have continued to harass the enemy&apos;s lines of communica-tion, and heavy casualties have been inflicted on armoured fighting vehicles,especially on those which had been drawn up for attacks on Tobruk. the aerodromes at Derna, El Adem and Menastir were heavily attacked, and hangars and other aerodrome buildings were destroyed, as well as enemy aircraft on theground.51. Enemy operations during the early part of the week were on a restrictedscale and were almost exclusively confined to heavy fighter activity. The assault on Tobruk on the 14th, reported in the Military Situation, was heavily supportedby air attacks. A mixed formation of some seventy aircraft, including Ju. 87&apos;s,Me. 110&apos;s and some Italian aircraft, attacked in the morning, and a smaller forcefollowed on in the afternoon; ten enemy aircraft were destroyed by fighters and four by A.A. guns.Italian East Africa.52. Our aircraft have made several successful attacks on the few remainingItalian aerodromes, resulting in considerable damage to enemy aircraft on theground. Reconnaissance and bomb and machine-gun attacks were carried out insupport of land operations, and supplies were delivered by air to some of thepatriot forces.HOME  SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.53. No enemy bombing took place on six days of the period under review.On the remaining day, the 14th April, bombs fell on an Aeroplane Factory atChadderton, Manchester, and damaged the roof. There were no casualties.Minor bombing was reported from East Anglia, the Isle of Wight, and Par inCornwall.By Night.54. Night bombing has continued on a heavy scale. On the 10th/11th AprilBirmingham was attacked for the second night in succession, but on a muchlighter scale. Coventry was also bombed and the damage and casualties were con-siderable.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week :  Germany.Berlin.-Further results of the raids on the 12th/13th and the 23rd/24thMarch have come to hand. The engine-sheds at the Tempelhof marshalling yardand the yard itself were severely damaged. The neighbouring goods stations,Sudende and Mariendorf, at the southern approaches to the yard also suffered severely. The S.S. barracks in Grosslichterfelde were hit and destroyed. office buildings in the Charlottenstrasse (one of the principal thoroughfares crossing the Unter den Linden), in the Manteuffelstrasse, and in the Akazienstrassewere hit. Houses in the Raupaohstrasse were destroyed and the damage washeavy in Weinmeisterstrasse (a commercial district) and in the Kleiststrasse andCourbierestrasse (which is comparable to the Charing Cross Road and TottenhamCourt Road district of London). A whole block of buildings was destroyed orburnt out opposite the Schoneberg Town Hall, and bombs which fell in thefashionable quarter of Dablem on the 23rd March caused a considerableevacuation of wealthy people from that district to the country. A chemicalfactory, believed to be that of Otto Hoffmann, in the Kurfurstenstrasse, was hit and damaged beyond repair.Kiel. -Photographs taken on the 7th April show the results of the raid onthe 23rd/24th March. Buildings in the naval arsenal, in a residential areaSouth of the Deutsche Werke Yard and a similar area on the West side of the harbour suffered varying degrees of damage. The area most affected was thatadjoining the railway junction to the south of the main station, where several buildings were damaged by fire and at least one line of rails severed for 20 yards.A large building in the Germania brewery and another in the Ringstrasse(believed to be the prison) have been badly damaged. Photographs taken afterthe first heavy attack on the 7tb/8th April show three main areas of severe damage : -First. The Deutsche Werke shipbuilding yards : There can be little doubtthat the effect on production must be serious. The largest building in the yard,the engineering shop, has received a direct hit, and an area where four smallerbuildings stood has been laid waste. The boiler-house is wrecked and a foundryadjoining severely damaged. Three important store depots have no roof andthe administrative offices are almost completely destroyed. A fire was stillsmouldering in three long sheds that had been burnt out, and the cable-testing-house no longer exists.Second. Nearly all the property in an area about 540 yards in length andaveraging 100 yards in width, stretching from the Werftstrasse to Johannestrasse,has been demolished or burnt out. Smoke still hovers over the area, which inthe main comprised the houses of the skilled dockyard workers.Third. The area between Kleiner Kiel and the Seegarten jetties has been thoroughly &quot;blitzed&quot; as a result of H.E. and incendiary bombs. This area is approximately triangular in shape, each side being about 300 yards long, and practically all the buildings are destroyed or burnt out.Considerable damage is disclosed in other parts of Kiel, and, in particular,workshops and sheds in the Germania shipbuilding yard have suffered varying degrees of damage. The damage at this yard does not compare with that shownat the Deutsche Werke, but it is of considerable interest that the principal feature of night photographs taken during the second heav)r raid on the 8th/9th is firesincreasing in intensity in the Germania Yard, It is understood that IJ-BoatNo. 46 received a direct hit and was damaged while at Kiel. It is only known that this took place during last year.
Mannheim. It is now possible to show the effect of the December raids onthe supply of coal from Germany to Italy. Prior thereto an average of 2,600wagons of coal was passing weekly via the St. Gothard route to Italy. For two weeks at least the average dropped by 50 per cent, (representing 26,000 tons ofcoal) and conditions were not normal until the middle of March.
