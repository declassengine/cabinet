G. DILL.C. PORTAL.Great George Street, S.W.1,April 16, 1941.A.-FRENCH.(i) Navy.Free French Naval Forces.Ships out of A ction. It is clear from the attached table* that, on the whole,the design of French ships, where seakeeping qualities are concerned, has notbeen successful. Apart from mechanical defects, 2 of the French ships now under repair were damaged in harbour, apparently through no fault of the French.One of the Polish-manned ships laid up is Ouragan-^a. French vessel. Sheis to be handed back to the French. Her relit is to be a long one, and it is forconsiderationt whether the French should not be given a British or Americandestroyer (a reliable one) to man until Ouragan is ready. It is all-important thatwe should give every assistance to the Free French to bring their morale to thehighest pitch.   Under existing conditions, where the bulk of their officers and* Annex.f The First Lord of the Admiralty has subsequently approved giving them one corvette.[22402] b
men spend the greater part of their time in dockyards patching up crocks, moralemust suffer. The majority of the Free Frenchmen recognize this and are anxiousto be actively employed.Depot Arrangements. The depot ship Courbet has been paid off, and herplace taken by the two small vessels A miens and A was. This has resulted in therelease of a number of skilled ratings for sea service, and has made possible the manning of several more vessels, including Leoville, some more Chasseurs, 4 M.L&apos;sand 2 V.T.B&apos;s.Training. British training facilities are being more and more used.A second contingent, 80 men, has been sent to H.M.S. Royal Arthur for a generaldisciplinary course, and smaller numbers for Signal, W/T and Gunnery (thelatter in H.M.S. Excellent). Arrangements are being made to send some Frenchratings to one of our Mechanical Training Establishments.Morale. Continued improvement in morale and discipline is evident. Theconduct of French crews in the recent heavy air raid on Portsmouth was referredto in an appreciative signal from the Admiralty to the French Admiral. Thissignal gave him great pleasure.During the recent visit of H.R.H. the Duke of Kent to Devonport the crew of the Bouclier were included in the parade for his inspection. They were smartand well drilled.Frenchmen in the Royal Navy.2.

One Czech is at a LinkTrainer Course.E. NORWEGIANS.(i) Navy.13. The crews now training at Devonport for 3 &quot; Town &quot; Class Destroyersare making excellent progress in their Gunnery Courses. The majority of thesemen, who were Merchant Seamen, did the course at Skegness, and their disciplinewhich is remarkably good is a tribute to their spirit and to the effectiveness of royal Arthur training.The keenness of the crew of the MansfMd, the first &apos;&apos; Town &apos;&apos; class destroyerto be commissioned by the Norwegians, is commented on. This is particularlysatisfactory, as the efficiency of the crew, owing to insufficient technical training,was the subject of criticism when the ship was first taken over.The reaction of the Norwegian Navy to the Lofoten raid has beensummarised as follows:  &apos;&apos; Their reaction to the recent Lofoten raid was interesting. This action was not considered a very great achievement because it was in North Norway.The success of this operation was therefore accepted as a matter of course,and it was generally believed that such raids could be repeated frequentlywith impunity. The officers are impatient that more attacks of this kind should be made.&quot;The great majority of the latest Norwegian contingent at Skegness are drawn from the men brought from the Lofoten Islands. They are mostly fishermen andknow less English than the merchant service seamen who largely composedprevious classes. They are young, quick to learn and very keen. Living underNazi rule has apparently made them exceedingly militant.A further number of men from Lofoten have been sent for training with.M.S. Lochinvar, Port Edgar.(ii) Army.14. Strength. South Scottish Area: 107 Officers, 1,356 Other Ranks,7 Nurses, 9 Female Canteen Workers.Command. Colonel Oscar Strugstad has arrived in the U.K. to takecommand of the Contingent at Dumfries.

British instructors are assisting inthe training of the M.G. Company. A squad of men are training as mechanicsfor the Norwegian Air Force. 19 Officers and N.C.Os. have attended a Course atScottish Command Central School.Security. Fair.Welfare. Satisfactory. The Norwegian C.-in-C. is dealing with thishimself, and will only ask for British assistance when he considers it necessary.Arrangements have been made to teach new arrivals English.Morale. Good. The film of the raid on Lofoten Islands was shown and wasenthusiastically received.(iii) Air Force.15. The Norwegian Float Plane Squadron is due to sail for Iceland in thelatter half of April, where it will be known as No. 330 (Norwegian) Squadron.Twenty-seven Norwegian Air Force Fighter Pilots have completed theirflying training in Canada, and arrangements have been made for these soon to begiven their operational training in the U.K.Nineteen Norwegian maintenance personnel are being trained in this country,and further maintenance personnel are being recruited in Canada and the U.K.16. The number of Belgians under training at Skegness has recentlydiminished owing to recruiting difficulties, but it is hoped to remedy this stateof affairs.There is an unfortunate competition between some of the Allied Armies andNavies in recruiting their nationals. This applies mainly to the Norwegians and belgians. The Armies have undoubtedly enlisted many seamen into their ranks and although a large number of these have been &quot; rescued&quot; for the Navies the generals have retained a good many. It is quite clear that, especially in thisphase of the war, every seaman is required at sea, whether in war vessels ormerchant ships.   The matter is being discussed by the Admiralty and War Office.(ii) Army.17.   Strength. Tenby: 37 officers, 516 other ranks, 5 nurses.Carmarthen : 27 officers, 731 other ranks.Equipment.

(iii) Air Force.18. Fourteen pilots have been serving in R.A.F. Squadrons during themonth.The formation of a Belgian Flight in a Fighter Squadron of fighter command has been approved, and will be established in No. 609 Squadron. the manning of a whole Squadron by Belgian pilots will be considered when sufficient numbers have been trained.All Belgians at the R.A.F. Franco-Belgian Air Training School at Odiham(28 in number) have passed out of the Initial Training Wing into the ElementaryFlying Training Wing.Forty Belgians are in other R.A.F. Flying Training Schools, and two will shortly be posted to Squadrons from Operational Training.Two Belgians have started training as Air Observers.WELFARE.19. The work of the Seamen&apos;s Welfare Board of the Ministry of labour is developing satisfactorily. The Board has appointed officers at 8 ports, whoco-operate closely with the Naval authorities there. N.A. (F) 2 S.L. is on theabove board.In co-operation with the Y.M.C.A., plans have been made to open a largeAllied centre at Plymouth.An important part of welfare work is to provide accommodation for Alliedofficers and men when they go on leave. The arrangements made are, thanks tomany willing helpers, working well.In co-operation with the Port Amenities Liaison Officer, Plymouth, andother helpers, attention has been paid to the welfare of Belgian and Frenchfishermen at Brixham and Paignton. The employment of those unable to fish,as well as their housing and education, have been taken in hand.During the last month special attention has been given to Allied welfarework in Edinburgh (the Women&apos;s Voluntary Service there does particularlyuseful work), Belfast, Londonderry and Dartmouth.ANNEX.General State of Allied Navies.The following table shows, to a certain extent, the state of seagoing activity of the Allied Navies : Employment of Allied Ships in European Waters.Country.
