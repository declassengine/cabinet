After due consideration recent patrol carriedout &quot;by H.M.S. HOOD and 2 Cruisers in vicinity 043 degs.H, 018 degs. W.      I am of the opinion that if our seapatrols are to block exit from Brest with a good chance ofsuccess there are 2 main requirements.     The first isaddition of an aircraft carrier to our Force.     Second isprovision of a fully defended base in south west Ireland.As regards latter I feel that increased protection thatsuch a base would give to our shipping is so great that nothing should be allowed to stand in the way of ouracquiring one.
