Public interest here has &quot;been suddenly anddeeply stirred by reports current.    American Minister hasshown lively interest,    For Diplomatic reasons he did notconsult me till last night and he then showed me following telegram which he had despatched to Washington.    Begins.I am confidentially informed that Mr. Churchill intendson Tuesday next to announce the operation of conscription in ulster.    Irish Nationalist conference in North have adoptedthis pledge  &apos;denying the right of the Churchill Government ttenforce compulsory conscription in Ireland we pledge ourselvessolemnly to one another to resist conscription by the most effective means at our disposal consonant with the law ofGod&apos;s Eire Government leaders yesterday conferred with leader of both Opposition parties.    This is the News Leaders thismorning.    Opposition leaders yesterday informed me that conscription without a conscientious objectors&apos; escape clausefor minority Catholic Nationalists will constitute a majorirretrievable and fatal blunder at this time and play directlyinto de Valera!s hands with grave possibilities for american interests.    They predict draft riots,   the escape of draftdodgers to Southern Ireland who v/ill be acclaimed as heromartyrs by three fourths of the population, and the fermentingof trouble by representatives anfl fifth columnists.    the clearest headed leader predicts that de Valera will seizethis opportunity to escape from economic and politicalrealities by proclaiming himself the leader of the oppressedminority and with the blessing of the Cardinal will raiseTO BE KEPT UN DEBLOCK AND KEY.UiB requested that, spatial euro may he taken tem^&quot;W ^%^LTAmiG MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ) .

anti-British feeling and call a Holy War.    I think it avery likely prediction.    All classes of opinion here unitein condemning the move as calamitous.    It&apos; appears to he a repetition of the same fatal blunder made during the last war;      Unless Britain is prepared from a military point ofview to seize the whole country it appears to be madness.So little can be gained and so little lost.    Eightythousand Irish volunteers in British army will be dis-affected.    A Government, a popular majority and an armyinclined to be friendly to Britain rather than to the Axiswill become definitely hostile, possibly giving activeaid to German;?&apos; and, most important of all.  the pro-BritishOpposition will be helpless and the opportunity of dividing the country on the question of the ports will be lost forthe duration.    The effect on Irish American opinion at this juncture is not for me to estimate.    There is a gravesituation^    I talked with Winant last night.    He had heardno discussion of the matter,    I shall acquaint the IrishPrime Minister with the purport of this telegram and ask him for constructive suggestions.    However justified ourcomplaints of Irish-American pressure group methods on our aid for Britain&apos;s policy I believe our interests and Irishinterest the same in this matter.    Please -rush, this tothe President.    Ends,2. Mr.  de Valera&apos;s i&apos;irst reaction to American Minister&apos;attitude was to thank him warmly for his help.      But verylate last night he rang up to say that on reconsiderationhe had decided that an escape clause for Catholics would not do.      He would oppose conscription in principle.    AmericanMinister expressed to him his bitter disappointment atunhelpful attitude.    No doubt de Valera realised thatdiscrimination on religious lines would weaken his politicalattack on the measure.    Nevertheless, an escape clause forCatholics if practicable would, in fact, solve thedifficulty,    A special meeting of the Dail has been summonedfor to-morrow,    Monday afternoon, and I anticipate thatMr.  de Valera will seize the opportunity to rally hisadherents and the Left Wing by a fervent Nationalistutterance.3. Opposition leaders, notably Dillon,  are for the mostpart less concerned with the questions of principle andNationalism involved in the issue of conscription, than withthe danger that de Valera will be enabled to escape from his present troubles by an anti-British trumpet:call.    Oppositionto Mr.  de Valera on pro-British lines has gained strengthlately.    Last week the Opposition presented him with a demand that he should recall Aiken from America on the score of hisinept performance there.    They maintain that conscriptionissue will present de Valera with a scoop and weaken their position.    American Minister strongly supports this view.h. The case for conscription inside Ulster is no doubtunanswerable.    But if we consider reactions in Ireland andpossibly in America, expediency of measure appears most doubt-ful. My view is that we shall not get any move forward heretill we have a clash with de Valera. When that comes we shall need the Opposition and we should avoid taking any steps thatweakens them and strengthens, de Valera.    Facilities on theWest Coast are presumably vastly more important than Ulster5spresent needs.    If we do not put a foot wrong we may have less-difficulty than is expected in making a forceful approach tothe solution of the ports question.
